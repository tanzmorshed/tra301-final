"mimiblanton","2","310","461","25 March 2017"," How can this have so many talented actors and be this bad?
","I am a huge fan of the original and I was thrilled when the cast was announced. I'm a big fan of Emma Watson and most of the other supporting actors so I went in with high hopes for this. It was awful! The CGI and auto-tuning were distracting and poorly done. On the subject of auto-tune- why did they insist Emma Watson do her own vocals when she clearly wasn't up to the task? Several other numbers, notably ""Gaston"" and ""Be our Guest"" fell flat. None of the charm or warmth of the original.<br/><br/>The performances were another issue for me which blows my mind considering the talent propping this horrid remake up. I can't fathom who approved the accents of Ewen Mcgregor and Emma Thompson. They were BAD. Emma Watson's performance was not what I expected from her. It was like she was trying but missing the mark time and again. Her Belle is condescending at times, bland in others, and overall forgettable. **spoiler** When Gaston and the beast have their fight,in this version instead of stabbing beast in the back, Gaston shoots him unexpectedly like twice. Emma Watson's ""reaction"" to this is a prime example of my above complaints. She doesn't seem shocked, sad, NOTHING. She waits until he's been shot a few times and has been down awhile before changing emotion at all and even then her ""sorrow"" at his death is horribly unbelievable. I could not believe this was Emma Watson preforming in this way. The beast was eh, Lafou wasn't funny (the theater was at no point filled with laughter. My 10 year old laughed twice the whole time), and the servants weren't charming or at all like their cartoon versions. I also hate that the funny back and forth between Lumiere and Cogsworth wasn't there. The only one I enjoyed was Luke Evans as Gaston. He was far from perfect but I think he did best out of everyone. <br/><br/>As I scroll through the IMDb reviews with the occasional 8 or 9, and pages of 2's and 4's, I can't understand how the rating is a 7.8. I give it a 2 for effort and can say with 100% certainty that I won't ever sit through it again. Another pointless remake. Disappointing."
"bignose-67352","1","462","701","18 March 2017"," Leaves a lot to be desired
","MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS<br/><br/>I don't usually do reviews but this film was such a huge disappointment I couldn't fight it anymore. The original movie was so good and, considering this is the exact same movie, there was really not much that could go wrong. In theory of course, because in reality the final result is just soulless. Everything feels fake. From Emma Watson's acting to the cgi and the props. I love Emma Watson but in this film she is just playing herself trying to play Belle. To be fair though, no one in the film actually manages to instill the characters with the same emotion and personality as the original except maybe Josh Gad. Luke Evans is very good but his character is written as a villain from the start, while in the original he evolves from slightly annoying to ""evil"". Which brings me to my next point: the awful writing. The film treats the audience like we're stupid and needs to explain everything verbally instead of just letting things show through the action. The characters are one dimensional and don't change as the story unfolds. Gaston is the villain. The Beast is just a misunderstood soul from the beginning despite the prologue telling us otherwise. Even his bad temper is watered down. The writers had already the script written for them, all they had to do was add a few more lines here and there and create two or three scenes that would blend in seamlessly with the original (since, I repeat, they chose to use almost word for word the 1991 script with minor changes). Well, the new dialogue feels very wooden and unnatural. The new scenes add nothing to the story and, even though the creators try to answer some questions we have from the original, in the end they create new plot holes that go unanswered. I miss the subtlety of the 1991 film in which every expression, every line and every pause added something either to the progression of the story or the characterization of the heroes without anything feeling forced. I keep mentioning the original a lot but that is because this movie has nothing new to offer really, so I can't fully separate it from the 1991 one. In the end, what annoys me the most is that the 2017 remake had great potential to become a new classic and stand on its own had it been handled a little differently and not with a rushed ""let's make some good money"" mentality. There are very few good things about this movie, one of which is the music which is simply magical and manages to convey all the emotions the actors can't. Then there is the ending (after the transformation) where there is a more realistic touch as the villagers remember their friends-relatives that work at the castle and are finally reunited. Overall, despite the enormous hype, the movie just makes the original stand out even more as a timeless film that won't be surpassed by another adaptation any time soon."
"tmzaepfel","2","274","415","31 March 2017"," Extensive review **SPOILERS BELOW**
","I'm going to share an unpopular opinion. I'm heartily sorry to my fellow Disney fans, but I feel the need to say something: This obsession/worship of the new Beauty and the Beast is BS.<br/><br/>I saw this film with my 6-year-old a couple weeks ago. While there's plenty about which to gripe, here's one of my biggest problems: I can't stand this constant CGI-heavy everything-must-be-a-sequel-or- a- remake era of film making. It's making movie makers lazy.<br/><br/>Wanna make a buck? How about remake the biggest Disney films of all time but in LIVE ACTION. OMG *heart emoji* *heart eyes emoji* *crying emoji* *hands raised emoji*<br/><br/>More like dollar signs. That's all this film was about. Dollars. Millions and millions of them. Yes, every film needs to make money, but Disney isn't hurting. They can afford to make quality films... and they do! They really do. But this wasn't one of them. This was a cash grab and nothing more.<br/><br/>Let's focus on the visuals in the film. Stills from the finished product were gorgeous. Everything was so intricate and colorful and on such a huge scale. The problem is that it was literally everywhere.<br/><br/>Go to an art gallery. There are canvases, stand alone sculptures, photos, etc. All organized in a specific way. There's a break between each piece, whether by floor or wall, that allows you to digest it and have a moment to reflect.<br/><br/>Movies like B&TB are like the entire building in which you hold the gallery is a ""work of art"". There's no space to reflect, just constant stimulation. You haven't a moment to enjoy the beauty and grandeur of it all because it's literally everywhere.<br/><br/>Storytelling-wise, it was all over the place. They already had a basic story thanks to the original, but you can't just do that. You have to add as much back story as you can, fill those plot holes, make it the SAME but BETTER.<br/><br/>They were shoehorning in so much that half the damn thing was backstory. And it wasn't told chronologically. Noooo, ma'am. That's not how the original was structured, so we CAN'T deviate from THAT. What about the music? The music? You mean the mostly half-assed regurgitated pile of those classic songs I loved listening to growing up and still enjoy? And the extra songs shoved in just so that you always had something to distract you from how they didn't know how to write a proper story with poignant and meaningful silences?<br/><br/>Look. I love Emma Watson. I really do, but her voice... She sounded weak. I'm sure she tried really hard, but she doesn't have the vocal chops for this. Don't get me started on Ewan McGregor's horrible accent and lazy singing.<br/><br/>The Beast was fine, but his song after Belle left totally ruined the moment. He was supposed to be in pain and the moment in the original film where he roared out the window was perfect. You understood his sorry and his sacrifice. No song needed.<br/><br/>And since when is Gaston NOT a baritone? To be fair, though, Gaston and LeFou were the best thing about this whole mess. They should have just done a movie about their war adventures and I would've been happy.<br/><br/>They poured on the whole ""LeFou is gay"" thing a bit thick for my taste. It was the only thing that added levity to the movie (despite how much fun it should have been already), but it seemed a bit cheap. I'm not going to apologize for wanting more for my LGBTQ characters than to be just the comic relief.<br/><br/>Want to know a CGI-heavy Disney remake that they did right? Surprisingly enough... it was The Jungle Book. They took the old one, used a couple of the songs, but made it completely their own. It was a similar story, but they didn't rely completely on it. Leave it to my boy Jon Favreau to retell an old story with fake animals and make it feel more real and original than anything in B&TB.<br/><br/>That's all I can think to say for now. Call me jaded and picky. It might be true, but it's also true that I have higher standards for my movies... especially from Disney.<br/><br/>TL;DR - Over-CGI'd-musical-number-heavy mess attempts to distract you from the fan-service-and-needless-backstory-filled plot so that you don't realize what you are watching is just shiny, saccharine- glazed vomit."
"ruhail-mohammad-ali","2","179","279","22 March 2017"," simply boring
","I had the opportunity to watch this movie today and man it was disappointing. It was boring. reason being perhaps that it felt like the copy of the original. These were the great cartoons which we grew up watching. But why would the same songs, characters, story be entertaining for us, we could just watch the cartoons again, why bother to remake. It might have been entertaining if characters were a little believable at least. The beast lack any emotion. Emma Watson (though I love her) was just trying to copy belle from the cartoons. She wasn't even given a chance to try to portray the character of belle and not the 'acting' of cartoon belle (she wasn't even successful in that). The only person I liked in the movie was Gaston. The rest of the characters were soooo animated that it stole the real feel of the movie which should really be the purpose of remaking a movie after all. A few new songs were added which were quite boring. The village of belle was aweeeefuulllll. Why Why Why would they make a village which just look like a ground full of hideous people. Why not put a little more money in that part. The reason of the movie should be to give a real life feeling to fairy tales ( which jungle book and Cinderella gave), not to just make it more cartoonish.<br/><br/>stay away from this one and save your money"
"sarahalmawlawi","2","192","301","25 March 2017"," A Torturing Disappointment
","The movie from the first scene up to the end was emotionless and spiritless. I do appreciate that they didn't want to change the story much and keep the classic version for the most. Even when the movie was slightly tweaked, it was in the wrong dull way. Some tweaks don't really make sense and don't add up.<br/><br/>I don't know whom should be blamed for the 'emotion delivery failure' is it the cast or the director? Emma Watson is good actress for some certain roles, but certainly not this one. She was very stiff. We couldn't differentiate her surprise from anger or love from sadness. In many scenes Belle and the Beast were talking so fast with no emotions, soul or spirit. It was as if they were rehearsing on a play by reading out loud from their scripts and the director was simply not there.<br/><br/>Cinematography had a problem too. Too many close ups. The original cartoon had some close ups too, but Do they really have to copy everything as-is? The couple dancing scene cinematography could have been better.<br/><br/>I really don't advise anyone to see this movie. Disney failed this time. It happens, though!. Hopefully we'll know what really happened."
"suroorzehra","1","328","528","29 March 2017"," Plain
","Where do I start. This adaptation of Disney's 1991 Beauty and the Beast was an utter disappointment. Emma Watson as Belle was extremely unconvincing from the start to the end. She had the same expressions as the actress from Twilight. The animators did a terrible job with the Beast. He looked fake and lifeless. They could have used special makeup to create the beast similar to the Grinch where we get to see Jim Carrey's expressions. The side character animations were poorly executed. Overall I felt the film was rushed as there was lack of compassion and chemistry between the characters. There was a lot of CGI and green screen which could have been replaced by normal acting, because then why make an animated version of an animated film? This is by far the worst remake of an animated classic."
"wmsfp","2","202","320","22 March 2017"," Miscast of Belle
","Overall the film was decent, a bit boring at times. The acting was OK, but it failed to ever ""sweep you away"" like the animated version did for years. <br/><br/>The most frustrating part was Belle, or Emma. I don't dislike her and I could care less about feminism. However, I do think a lead role that includes substantial signing should be able to.......SING!<br/><br/>The horrible use of auto-tune was cringe worthy and her English accent was very thick for someone that was born in Paris and grew up in France.... <br/><br/>I though McGregor was great as Lumiere and hid his English accent well. Mrs. Potts and Cogsworth are supposed to be English, so that worked well."

","This movie is very overrated and the reason why the film is popular because of its promotion. Emma Watson performance is really boring as hell and her voice is not that good.

"schlomo-jones","1","312","515","6 April 2017"," Moral of the Story: Marry for Money
","Beauty and the Beast is about a deposed slave-owning aristocrat who imprisons a farm girl. She undergoes Stockholm Syndrome, identifying with her captor, then proceeds to betray her village's uprising and reinstates the slave-owning prince to power by offering her hand in marriage.<br/><br/>Furthermore, Belle's contempt for the provincial farming community and their lack of refinement stems from vague memories she has of a more cultured upbringing in Paris. When she later is shown a vision of her childhood house and remarks ""it's so small,"" this was a moment where she could put it all together. <br/><br/>The lack of refinement in the rural areas was due to brutal exploitation which forced unmarried women to beg in the streets. It is likely that the community's surplus resources were taken by aristocrats like the Beast, and used to fund his opulent palace. Thus, depriving the farming community of leisure time and resources for education and arts, which would have made them more sophisticated, meeting Belle's approval.<br/><br/>It is also possible that Gaston's intense desire to marry, which caused his nefarious plot, may be linked to levée en masse, a policy that required conscription for all unmarried French men between 18 and 25. So his patriarchal demands were a direct result of state policy to benefit the aristocracy by providing soldiers to sacrifice their lives in land disputes between inbred blue blood cousins.<br/><br/>Then, this exploitation provided a concentration of wealth and power in the city, which created the market for her father to pursue creative employment rather than farm work. This also forced them into slums, where squalor and poor public health systems lead to the spread of plague, which is met with cold indifference by the doctor, indicating lack of public health care as a source of Belle's childhood trauma. <br/><br/>All of this exploitation and upward wealth transfer made its way back to the remote plantation of the Beast.<br/><br/>When confronted with this inescapable logic, what does she do? She decides to take the easy way out and enjoy the life of luxury, waited hand and foot by Beast's slaves, who feed her, clothe her, sing and dance for her. A life she always felt entitled to, on part of her feeling of superiority towards her provincial neighbors.<br/><br/>The moral of the story is, marry for money, and ignore the suffering of the poor. A terrible message for children."

"jeremyrleath","2","152","245","22 March 2017"," Unimaginative and bland
","Like all Disney fans from the 80's to present, I found myself excited to see this live action adaptation once I saw the teaser poster! I decided to ignore the naysaying that followed with the trailers, and the wave of immoral rhetoric being associated with the sexuality of LeFou. (Rolls eyes) <br/><br/>Ignoring all of this I decided to make a judgement call after seeing the movie. I've came to the conclusion that this movie is to Disney movies what the original Blair witch was to the horror genre. This movie apparently cost $160,000,000 which begs to question: Where did they spend all this money? The sets designs and props were hastily put together. The village at the opening looks like the village Dorothy lands in, at the beginning of the wizard of oz. Next is the CGI! The budget and expertise behind Disney should not have been lacking. This movie could've been a cash cow. But the sad fact is, Disney let fine details and lackadaisical work ethic be passed off as a masterpiece. <br/><br/>Emma Watson is a tremendous actress, and this is evident in her ability to phone in a wonderful performance to a imaginary beast. Disney please, please... please heed this. When the Gorilla from 'Mighty Joe Young' a movie from 1998 looks more realistic than your beast in 2017 you must realize you've made a mistake. Disney used to be the go to for amazing movies that left you with spirit and wonder. What they've proved with their latest live action movies Is the realization, that they just crank out regurgitated movies with less effort just to cash in on nostalgia. From now on we will be renting Disney movies from redbox instead of seeing them in theaters."

","This adaptation is a disgrace to the original. Watson's voice is auto- tuned to death and the Beast CGI wasn't good. Each time the Beast popped up, he was very off putting. Watson's line deliveries are poor and doesn't do the animated princess justice. She also seems a bit too young for the role. She is a total miscast. Despite the Beast's CGI, at least his performance was very good as both the Beast and Prince compared to Watson. Emma Thompson's rendition of Tale as Old as Time does not beat the animated tea cup, but at least she was not auto tuned to death. There are very few moments of originality as it is a frame by frame copy to the animated film. It's very uninspiring and unnecessary.<br/><br/>0/10."
"luxorr","1","276","459","22 March 2017"," One of the worst Disney movies ever
","Bad movie for sure. Disney movies are most of the times one of the best I have ever seen, but not always this is true which is the case here. This movie was so boring so I was wandering what to do 1 hour and 50 minutes, only the last 10 minutes of the movie is worth seeing. Budget 160 millions dollars and the result is total disappointment. All this musical elements in the movie is just too much, it takes away the real feeling that this movie is supposed to bring to the viewers. Ema Watson clearly is worst choice for this role, she was looking like Beast's daughter when standing next to him, she is just too young for this role. This movie should be rated not to be viewed by viewers over 16 years of age. Overall very bad movie, it is a clear waste of time to see this movie, but we will forget Disney and will wait for them to get back on track this month of May."
"gk-97707","2","185","304","9 April 2017"," Fake historical facts, zero original music, average actors. Disappointed
","Once again I was convinced that Hollywood is dead. First of all, main the Beast and the Beast auditory are kids and teenagers from age 6 to age 18. So no big expectation for adult auditory. It is not supposed to be masterpiece of all times. But even so... how you could misrepresent historical facts like that? Medieval France. What we see? Black people lived freely among white people, they dance happily together and drink in one bar. I understand things about political correctness. But don't you think it makes movie look fake and misrepresent original fairy tale. <br/><br/>Secondly, music. Did you actually hire song writers, authors, musicians for such big cinema event? There are some good songs. But it turned out they are all classic French songs or taken from 1991 animated ""The beauty and the beast"" movie.<br/><br/>Thirdly, actors. Well, I have no complains to Emma Watson beauty. Interesting young British actress. But Belle was French. French women have special charm and chic(remember Amelie?). Emma Watson with her solder walking and always the same face expression did not convince me. Animated Belle expressed more emotions and love in her eyes that Emma ""Belle"" Watson. As for other actors, was very pleased to see Kevin Kline. Only actor in the movie which performance I enjoyed. Other actors were very plain or their roles were so short that it is hard to do something outstanding."
"phantom_pixie","1","435","746","16 March 2017"," Water and CGI does not an instant classic make
","As a fan of the original Disney film (Personally I feel it's their masterpiece) I was taken aback to the fact that a new version was in the making. Still excited I had high hopes for the film. Most of was shattered in the first 10 minutes. Campy acting with badly performed singing starts off a long journey holding hands with some of the worst CGI Hollywood have managed to but to screen in ages. <br/><br/>A film that is over 50% GCI, should focus on making that part believable, unfortunately for this film, it's far from that. It looks like the original film was ripped apart frame by frame and the beautiful hand-painted drawings have been replaced with digital caricatures. Besides CGI that is bad, it's mostly creepy. As the little teacup boy will give me nightmares for several nights to come. Emma Watson plays the same character as she always does, with very little acting effort and very little conviction as Belle. Although I can see why she was cast in the film based on merits, she is far from the right choice for the role. Dan Stevens does alright under as some motion captured dead-eyed Beast, but his performance feels flat as well. Luke Evans makes for a great pompous Gaston, but a character that has little depth doesn't really make for a great viewing experience. Josh Gad is a great comic relief just like the original movie's LeFou. Other than that, none of the cast stands out enough for me to remember them. Human or CHI creature. I was just bored through out the whole experience. And for a project costing $160 000 000, I can see why the PR department is pushing it so hard because they really need to get some cash back on this pile of wet stinky CGI-fur!<br/><br/>All and all, I might be bias from really loving Disney's first adaptation. That for me marks the high-point of all their work, perfectly combining the skills of their animators along with some CGI in a majestic blend. This film however is more like the bucket you wash off your paintbrush in, it has all the same colors, but muddled with water and to thin to make a captivating story from. The film is quite frankly not worth your time, you would be better off watching the original one more time."
"lingweichuapipafiddle","2","119","193","6 April 2017"," Not too bad. But I personally felt that the 1991 version is still the best
","I think the problem with Disney live-action remakes, is that there's such awkwardness in the layout, I personally felt that in the case of Beauty and the Beast, the live-action version can't ""perform"" the story very well, it appears to me that they are trying to tell the story with a fusion that combines animation, movie and musical, a bit of everything in everywhere, however I don't really enjoy this experience. The actors and actresses were fine considering the demands and preference of the audiences (consumers), some of them did very well, Like Gaston and LeFou. I think that Emma Watson looks very pretty on screen as Belle, and her singing is okay, but I personally felt that her acting is very stiff, her singing skills is very much not enough for a musical. She is a very successful and smart celebrity, I think she is a very good fashion and makeup model too, but her performances (including Harry Potter, etc) on screen I've seen so far, haven't appear to me as a professional/convincing actress at all, I never seen her looking like she is doing (performing, acting) something she believes. As Belle Emma Watson sometimes looks miserable, like she is forcing her face to hold on expression(disgusted, love, sad, etc.) that she was told to. I felt that my money spent on the movie ticket was burned watching her performance, and this isn't the first time at all when it comes to movies that has her in the cast, I remember feeling really angry last time when I saw her performance in Harry Potter- The Goblet of Fire, because I can't believe I spent money to get to watch such unprofessional performance of a pretty ""actress"" like her on a mainstream movie, and now in B&TB she hasn't improve at all. <br/><br/>Overall I think everything on the screen appears to be pretty but also boring (awkward).

"Quint1965","4","412","711","3 March 2017"," The corporate version of Beauty And The Beast: Disney at it's most generic and dull
","Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear: where should I start folks. I had low expectations already because I hated each and every single trailer so far, but boy did Disney make a blunder here. I'm sure the film will still make a billion dollars - hey: if Transformers 11 can do it, why not Belle? - but this film kills every subtle beautiful little thing that had made the original special, and it does so already in the very early stages. It's like the dinosaur stampede scene in Jackson's King Kong: only with even worse CGI (and, well, kitchen devices instead of dinos).<br/><br/>The worst sin, though, is that everything (and I mean really EVERYTHING) looks fake. What's the point of making a live-action version of a beloved cartoon if you make every prop look like a prop? I know it's a fairy tale for kids, but even Belle's village looks like it had only recently been put there by a subpar production designer trying to copy the images from the cartoon. There is not a hint of authenticity here. Unlike in Jungle Book, where we got great looking CGI, this really is the by-the-numbers version and corporate filmmaking at its worst. Of course it's not really a ""bad"" film; those 200 million blockbusters rarely are (this isn't 'The Room' after all), but it's so infuriatingly generic and dull - and it didn't have to be. In the hands of a great director the potential for this film would have been huge.<br/><br/>Oh and one more thing: bad CGI wolves (who actually look even worse than the ones in Twilight) is one thing, and the kids probably won't care. But making one of the two lead characters - Beast - look equally bad is simply unforgivably stupid. No wonder Emma Watson seems to phone it in: she apparently had to act against an guy with a green-screen in the place where his face should have been."

"Dwright1212","3","644","1130","4 March 2017"," A meandering and dull mess. One of the biggest disappointments in recent years.
","Sure, I'm a huge film snob who (on the surface) only likes artsy-fartsy foreign films from before the 60's, but that hasn't stopped me from loving Disney's Beauty & The Beast; in fact, it's probably my favorite American animated film and is easily Disney's finest work. It's beautiful, it's breathtaking, it's warm, it's hilarious, it's captivating, and, in Disney fashion, it's magical. When I learned that Disney would be remaking their classic films, B&TB was undeniably the best wrapped package. How could they go wrong?<br/><br/>Oh man, they went wrong.<br/><br/>First thing's first: this film is so flat. The directing was dull and uninteresting throughout the entire film and it honestly felt like one of the Twilight sequels...and then I looked it up and found out that, yes, director Bill Condon was the man behind Breaking Dawn parts 1 & 2. Every shot looks bored and uninterested, which contrasts heavily with the original animated film that was constantly popping with vibrancy. The script too is boring because it's almost a complete remake of the original, though I guess most people won't mind that.<br/><br/>Next: the CGI is horrid. Although I didn't care for The Jungle Book from last year, I could at least admit that the CGI was breathtaking. The same cant be said for this film. Characters like Lumière, Cogsworth, Mrs Potts, and most of the cursed appliances have very strange, lifeless faces that are pretty off putting to be looking at for such a long time. All of the sets too look artificial and fake, especially the town towards the beginning. However, the biggest offender is easily and infuriatingly the character that mattered most: The Beast. The CGI on the Beast's face is so distracting that it completely takes you out of the film. His eyes are completely devoid of soul, and his mouth is a gaping video game black hole of fiction. Klaus Kinski looked much better in the Faerie Tale Theatre episode of Beauty & The Beast, and that was a 1984 TV show episode. But do you know why it looked better? Because it was an actual face with actual eyes, not some video game computerized synthetic monstrosity. When will studios learn that practical effects will always top CGI?<br/><br/>Finally: wasted casting. Emma Watson is beautiful, but she's no Belle. She is completely devoid of the warmth and humanity that made the animated Belle so beloved. Instead, she is cold and heartless throughout most of the film. Kevin Kline is 100% wasted and does nothing except look old. Ian McKellan, Ewan McGregor, Emma Thompson, and even Dan Stevens as the Beast are very expendable and could've been played by anyone else. The only good characters are Gaston and LeFou, mostly because they are fun and played by actors who breathe new life into their original shapes. If anything, this film should've been about Gaston and LeFou, but that would never happen because that would mean Disney couldn't cater to blind nostalgic 90's kids.<br/><br/>Overall, this film is a complete bore. It could've been better if even the special effects were good, but the CGI in particular is horrendous. I'm all for Disney remaking their nostalgia- catering 90's films, but they need to be interesting. This film, sadly, is not. Even the Christmas sequel is better than this film because it's at least something."

","I've seen the original more times than I can count so I was very excited when I heard about a live action version that sticks to the original movie. While they did stick to the original for a good portion, they changed many of the most iconic scenes and not in a good way. For example, they cut out the scene where Belle's father first encounters the beast by the fireplace, which is my son's favorite, and replaced it with something far less interesting. They also managed, and I don't know how, to ruin the music. All of the songs are slowed down so much that it's hard to care about them and they're lacking the booming vocals that made the originals so good. They also added a lot of unnecessary dialogue which makes for a much slower pace. Overall all this movie just lacks the character of the original. We were so bored that we actually left about half way through."

Still, pretty sure Disney doesn't care they got two tickets out of us, but if you read this it is nothing new or different and the inclusion of a so-called gay character is so irrelevant to the story and so ungay that it makes no difference. If you have seen the multiple other Beauty And The Beasts out there (animated or not) you have seen this. Disney must be really hard up for cash.

","I'm not a fan of remakes and to me, a Disney ""classic"" is extremely hard to recreate. Maleficent doesn't count as a ""remake"" ... which was still entertaining! However, I was dissuaded to watch this version in theaters because of all the bad reviews. So the only caveat I leave here is that I had lower expectations than normal when I watched.<br/><br/>Beauty and the Beast has been retold several times (since 1740!) and the Disney cartoon is not the one and only version to compare this movie to. I heard the songs prior to the movie and I wasn't in love. BUT -- once in context ... it all made sense. The acting seemed ""flat"" only because the people were showing true human (non- cartoon) emotion. Singing of a poor, provincial town would not be a HAPPY song for Belle ... but Emma Watson executed the mood perfectly. The chatter about the openly gay character was a terrible shadow on the movie and was #1) not the focus and #2) NATURAL in again, human life. <br/><br/>***SPOILERS AHEAD***<br/><br/>The adaptations, side stories and little facts were placed for very good reason. The audience sees a deeper story behind The Beast. In fact, the very reason why Maurice is imprisoned was taken from the original story written in 1740. The story comes full circle when the Beast takes Belle to Paris and sees where she came from and WHY taking a rose was so important. I really liked the relationships shown and how this movie stayed as true to the cartoon ""classic"" as possible with an added flair appropriate for 2017 and humanized the characters even more.<br/><br/>Give the movie a chance -- and remember, it's a FAIRY TALE. Not a platform that should reflect any position on anything social, economic or political. The added songs are not bad and I actually really like the Beast's solo. Remember, it's a movie meant to entertain audiences ... not prove abilities to critics."

","If it were in a theater rather than a cinema, it would have been great.<br/><br/>But the fact is we saw this before when it was called Beauty & the Beast.<br/><br/>The songs we all heard before. Rather than an animated background you have a computer animated background but we have still seen it before.<br/><br/>We sit down and pay to watch a movie we already saw turn live action and follow the same plot, the same game, as the movie we fell in love with oh so many years ago.<br/><br/>We are living in an era for that, but we still want it to change at least a little.<br/><br/>Like all remakes it is dull and boring and utterly mindless. Like all remakes it makes changes that are unnecessary and irritating and in some cases, fairly insulting to the fans of the original: Belle, not her father, is the eccentric town inventor and that would, maybe, work if he wasn't supposed get locked up for being, well, the eccentric town inventor with a story about a Beast.<br/><br/>Take away the establishment of one character that is sort of necessary to the plot and give it to another where it is less important to advance the story and do it only because, well, it's a remake, you have to find at least one way to really insult the fans...<br/><br/>And changes like this are the only way to do it because, otherwise, you have the EXACT same movie you saw before with little changes made to really just drag the monotony out as much as you can.<br/><br/>I hate remakes, but the fact that it IS THE SAME MOVIE just makes it so much more monotonous to watch than your average remake."
"orangecolouredsky","3","70","115","4 April 2017"," Shameless money grab that is sub-par at best
","Let me preface by saying that while the '91 cartoon is my favorite movie of all time, I am not a strict cartoon purist, as the Broadway musical of BATB is also one of my favorites and there are other takes on the fairy tale that I really enjoy as well. But, when you are doing the songs from the cartoon and even replicate some scenes shot-for-shot, I expect that the characters should feel familiar and the quality of the production should live up to its predecessor. Unfortunately, this 2017 version falls dreadfully short. <br/><br/>CASTING - The biggest blunder is Emma Watson in the lead role. This is not to disparage her as an actress in general, but she is not right for this. Her Belle lacks grace, enthusiasm, warmth and sincerity. She seems bored, and while it sounds like she could have quite a sweet voice with further training, it is evident she does not have that skill set yet. In the other title role, Dan Stevens' Beast is all CGI and you never forget it. They've also edited his voice to make him sound more ""beastly"", which makes his solo awkward to listen to. One has to wonder why they didn't just cast someone with a deeper voice then? The character also seems a more like a grumpy old man than a tortured soul in a beastly body. Why did Disney cast ""Hollywood names"" instead of people who were best for the role? It's not like there was ever a doubt this would be a box office smash anyway given the beloved source material. I also never believed for a moment the relationship between any of the characters with the exception of the playful rivalry/camaraderie between Cogsworth & Lumiere. <br/><br/>CGI AND MUSIC - For a ""live action"" version, it certainly feels more stilted and unreal. The CGI in general looks fake, and the enchanted objects are creepy. There are new songs but they are mostly dull. Now, I think Alan Menken is a musical genius, so perhaps it had something to do with having to write songs for non- singers. The Beast's new song is the best of the bunch, but the emotion doesn't seem appropriate for the scene. The reused songs have new arrangements & new lyrics, but with the exception of The Mob Song, the changes are distracting and feel oddly paced. <br/><br/>STORYLINE - In truth, the whole movie is oddly paced. Things are dragged out that don't need to be, and other things zoom by that should have been fleshed out. They give backstories, but odd ones at odd times in odd ways. Minor spoilers: For example, Gaston is a soldier who saved the village and that's why everyone loves him. He likes Belle for her looks but also her dignity.By giving the villagers a very good reason to like him, he is no longer a foil for the Beast. Gaston is supposed to be handsome, strong and charismatic and people equate that with being good. The Beast is ugly so they automatically think he's bad. Is not the moral that it's actually what's on the inside that counts? It seems they have forgotten the point. Even Belle makes a joke in poor taste at the end which undermines the message. Furthermore, significant details are altered which result in the Beast not changing & the leads basically falling in love by accident, and (SPOILER) the enchanted rose has no real significance in the end (END SPOILER) <br/><br/>I could say more, but I think you get the picture. I wanted to like it, but it grossly failed to enchant."
"dcarsonhagy","8","40","63","8 June 2017"," Beauty and the Beast (2017)
","The remake of ""Beauty and the Beast"" is Disney's latest in live action animation. Blending real actors with CGI, it's a story most of us know (and love) about Belle and the Beast. <br/><br/>Emma Watson (of Harry Potter fame) plays Belle, a simple country girl who is looking for her Prince Charming. She lives an ordinary life in an ordinary town surrounded by ordinary people. Trouble is, they think SHE'S strange. Gaston, the local hunk, has decided he must make Belle his wife since she clearly isn't interested in him. Fate, however, has other plans for both of them.<br/><br/>Although the film was very pretty to look at, it lacked depth and simply did not have the heart the animated version had. I love Emma Watson, but her singing voice was adequate at best. Kevin Kline (who portrayed Belle's father) looked like he would rather be anywhere but where he was. <br/><br/>It was Luke Evans (as Gaston) that stole the show. He stayed true to the character of Gaston, and man could he belt out a tune! Another problem I had is Disney trying to introduce a sexually confused character, LeFou. I wish someone would try to explain to me why this was done because, quite frankly, I am sick and tired of people trying to rewrite fairy tales just to make them ""politically correct."" <br/><br/>Rated PG and even with its flaws, I would still recommend it."
"chiendh","Null","79","133","25 March 2017"," Worse than the original, in the same group of recent, meaningless releases from Disney like Rogue One
","SPOILERS!! ---------- ----------<br/><br/>I saw the original classics of the era - Beauty and the Beast, The Little Mermaid, etc - so I was interested in seeing what this live-action could do with the story. Here, Disney attempts to remake their own animated version of Beauty and the Beast (BnB), but for various reasons, it falls far short of the classic animated version much like Rogue One fell far short of being a great Star Wars movie.<br/><br/>1) The songs suck. <br/><br/>One of the most glaring examples is when the Beast pines for Belle, and sings his song while climbing up the tower stairs. Something along the lines of 'I'm climbing these stairs, then looking out the open window.' This is repeated over and over as if we're to sing along to the line or be excited by it. Nope, complete fail.<br/><br/>The songs lack the vocal power of the original ones, failing mostly to inspire or make one tap one's feet. No humming along to this movie - it's dead on arrival.<br/><br/>2) The actors do not shine in their roles, sometimes, because the aura around them is too strong from past movies, sometimes, they simply are too generic for the role.<br/><br/>For example, Belle's dad is far too generic. One of those characters you look at and forget right away, even after the whole movie was seen. <br/><br/>The mysterious enchantress that enters in the beginning is nowhere near a Maleficent or Snow White Witch - she looks like some generic female that walked in, cursed the Beast, and you promptly forget.<br/><br/>Others like Gaston (still think he's from Fast and Furious), Watson (her performance here is dead, unlike her more moving Potter performances), etc. have the problem of being mismatched for the roles.<br/><br/>3) Really bad scriptwriting.<br/><br/>You've got lines with characters suddenly mentioning things out of the blue, unmotivated. eg. Dad parks his horse, says 'oh, there's water and hay.' Huh? Why? What does that add? Nothing. It would have been far better for him to park the horse and cut to next scene.<br/><br/>4) Movies should be something one can understand with the sound off, but there are many examples of things that don't make sense, and characters breaking out of their roles.<br/><br/>eg. If Gaston is really the battle hero he is, then why is he afraid of a few wolves in the forest? He's got a gun, guts, and strength, so why not just charge in and save the day? Okay, so he's played as a guy who is all show and no real guts in this movie in this scene, but later, he's crazy enough to shoot the Beast several times, jump across big gaps, etc.<br/><br/>eg. The Beast is supposed to be a BEAST, but he takes a few bites from attacking wolves and collapses, out of energy after the attack, wiped out. Yet, in the end, he takes multiple gun shots from Gaston before finally collapsing. <br/><br/>eg. Belle falls in Love with the Beast after a few scenes of them reading books, and he lets her go to save her dad. Huh?? Are girls really that Easy?? There's no motivation at all for a real girl to fall in love with the Beast after a few days in captivity, so it's unbelievable based on how it is shown.<br/><br/>4) A lot of the fun, the connection, the relationship between Belle and the household items are lost. <br/><br/>The animation had the interplay between them which you could see and feel, eventually building up a very strong connection between Belle and each of the items, like the teacup, the candle holder, etc. In this movie, it was more of a show and tell - Belle sits back, things are shown to her, and..that's it. Moving on, much like a Disney Fantasy ride - you see interesting displays, but no connection. Same for the horse and Belle. In the animation, you can see the horse reacting to the scary forest, setting up an undertone of fear and worry as they enter the dark forest. But in this movie, none of that - it's simply a 'machine' that she hops on, and it takes her to and from the Beast's home. <br/><br/>5) The lighting is uneven. There are places where it's really good and you can see the characters well-defined, then other places where it's just tough to see Belle and the surroundings (like the prison her dad was kept in and just outside that). This is a far cry from Potter where you can see inside the dimly lit school, but there's definition and more clarity to the details. Here, it simply goes black to dark gray and there's nothing there to add to the scene.<br/><br/>6) Too many competing messages and periods.<br/><br/>You've got Belle implying she doesn't need/want to get married in the beginning, then wanting to stay forever with the Beast in a few days. Yet, they look like they're living in the old ages, before the 20th century. <br/><br/>You've got Gaston with a gun, yet when the town attacks the Beast, most don't have a gun?! Are we in the swords and stone age, or gun age?<br/><br/>You've got lots of white characters, then, the mandatory politically correct insertion of a black female here and there.<br/><br/>You've got Belle saying 'I'm not normal' (ie. I'm not the usual cute girl that gets married young, has kids, etc), ie. smart and educated. Yet, that scene has her bending forward towards the camera many times to show her cleavage in an attempt to sexualize her despite her small breasts.<br/><br/>In the end, not worth a full-price movie ticket to see it in the theater. A DVD rental at most, fast-forwarded through the dull, slow scenes for sure."

So it was pretty intense to see the social media talk about it and hear their own opinions.

""Would they stay true to the Disney classic or totally take it on a opposite roller coaster?"" When it came out I was totally moved and in tears of joy. They did everything as they possibly could to make it real, and true to the Disney version. Little changes happened yes, like one or two songs, but they were all beautifully done and made for great reasons. All casting was beautifully done, music was perfect and it left me feeling like a child again. <br/><br/>I think that is what is so important.

The new songs, though surprising, fit remarkably well, and I never felt that the score missed a beat. And when all was added up, the sum was far more than any of the new and varied parts: this is a fresh masterpiece, beginning as a riff but ending with something much much more than a ""cover"" -- if Disney can do this as well with its other planned live-action/CGI versions, then count me in. This is a brilliantly-crafted film that honors and yet moves beyond its beloved original."
"Jared_Andrews","7","13","18","4 June 2017"," Lacks magic
","Before entering theater, I knew Emma Watson looked the part. Belle means beauty, and she certainly is that. With a movie that's highly concerned with pageantry, her looks are especially important. More so than simply supplying the necessary beauty to play Belle, she has the right look. She conveys intelligence, genuine concern, and a longing for more. It comes from her eyes. They tell her story. She expresses her thoughts and feelings clearly in every moment without saying a word.<br/><br/>For the most part, I could take or leave the live action Disney revivals. This one felt like it had more promise to me, and a large part of that came from the apropos casting of Watson. <br/><br/>As it turns out, she delivered. She does far more than look that part, she acts and sings it too. For anyone wondering, it really is her singing. Unfortunately, she and the other actors pre-recorded their vocal performances, which were subsequently dubbed over the visual scenes. That makes for the song and dance displays ring just a bit false, compared to the sincerity of those in La La Land. Granted, I understand that complaining that a movie doesn't live up to the standard of another movie that won six Oscars, is beyond finicky. <br/><br/>If you were worried that the new voices wouldn't do justice to the originals, rest easy. Every singer delivers, especially Watson. What a voice she has. Who knew Hermione had golden pipes? <br/><br/>The film doesn't wait long to unveil the real-life Belle's talents. She flexes her performing muscles as she glides her way through the quaint village brought to life. <br/><br/>Everything seems great, just a little long. And that's the movie's glaring problem—it's too long. The filmmakers took the original's tight 1 hour 24-minute runtime and ballooned it to 2 hours and 9 minutes. Even Emma Watson's charm can only last for so long. I'm not saying the movie needs to trim some fat, but there's no way it would fit in Belle's dress. Thank you, thank you. I'll be here all article. <br/><br/>As much as I've raved about Watson—and I strongly believe she deserves all the praise—the rest of the movie doesn't quite make it. At times, the spectacle wore off and I just felt bored. There were a few too many songs, and a few too many verses in some. I don't remember how long the original songs were, but I know that I never felt bored listening to them. <br/><br/>For all the glamour and loveliness, something was conspicuously absent. The movie lacks magic. None of the songs bombed, but they didn't exactly floor me either. <br/><br/>Another issue arose from the added scenes. I understand the desire to show us Belle's mother and the Beast's parents. Many children's movies omit parents, with the implication that they died, and that's it. An illumination of why the Beast (a prince at the time) so rudely turned away the stranger worked fine. But was it really necessary? Personally, I never had any trouble believing the spoiled prince angle. The dastardly daddy reveal didn't add much. <br/><br/>Perhaps it was intended to give viewers more sympathy for the Beast. Meh. He earned my sympathy when he showed his kindness to Belle. I always thought that was the point. The enchantress cursed him for treating people poorly. That was his issue, not his dad's. The insertion of the dad story makes it seem like the Beast's reprehensible behavior wasn't his fault. I didn't like that implication. <br/><br/>I was disappointed to see a few missed opportunities with the minority characters. A word of advice: don't bother including a black person as the bookkeeper if he doesn't have a chance to do anything. He's used as a showpiece. Nothing more. That's not progressive casting; it's condescending. <br/><br/>Sadly, the movie's usage of gay characters felt even more insulting. Including a gay character is fine, even better than fine, if the character is represented appropriately. In this case, appropriate simply means not in an overtly theatrical and effeminate manner. The whole stereotypical portrayal was annoying. <br/><br/>I'll end on a high note. Credit must be given to the unimpeachable Emma Thompson, Stanley Tucci, Kevin Kline, Ian McKellen, and Ewan McGregor. They performed admirably. <br/><br/>Future live action Disney films, should learn from Beauty. Casting is vital and so is keeping the runtime reasonable. Forever can spare a minute, but I don't have that much time."

","Come on Disney: what were you thinking?! You've got one of the most beloved films in your entire catalogue; the first animated film ever that was nominated for a best picture Oscar - and you give the new version of that film to the director of 'Twilight' parts 3 and 4? Has anyone of your executives even seen Bill Condon's 'Twilight' films or did you just look at all the money they made during their opening weekend? Just so you know: those films are atrocious. There are porn films who look better and have better plots (seriously).<br/><br/>Now the good news is, 'Beauty and the Beast' is nowhere near as bad as the Twilight films, but it DOES bear a striking visual resemblance to those teen shlock movies. And that's what I don't get: if you have the chance to make a film that will make 1.5 billion dollars (given the reviews are good) - wouldn't you want to make sure to make the best looking film possible? But over large stretches this film has the mediocre looking CGI of a cheap Lionsgate fantasy film and the nuanced color-grading of a bowl of M&Ms.<br/><br/>Emma Watson isn't half bad as Belle, but her acting feels forced in a way you can practically read the directions she gets from her director on her face (""now act SURPRISED"" - ""now show us a sense of WONDER"" - ""now look SAD""). Great actors like Kevin Kline are simply wasted because they have nothing to do besides just being there and have a certain look. The one actor who makes something of his role is, naturally, the one who plays the baddie; Luke Evans at least looks like he's having fun.<br/><br/>But all that is still not the worst. What sank the film for me was Beast. It's mind-boggling to me how a gigantic company like Disney lets a film open if the most important CGI effects obviously don't look convincing yet. Beast's face never looks real and that's just not acceptable. It's been almost 10 years since we got a completely convincing CGI ""beast"" face with Peter Jackson's King Kong, complete with alive looking eyes and natural facial expressions. Since then we got films like 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes' and 'Jungle Book' that looked even better and more realistic. So what happened?

But still, the bad aspects of this film just overrides any good ones.<br/><br/>There were too many distractions in the film that it does not evolve into a movie experience. There are lots of propaganda in this film. If you would like to put racial minority actors, you don't pick 18th century France as your setting. I am a racial minority so I can say this. They also depict that gays as mostly men in drag, weak and the so called gay scenes are not empowering at all but rather tacky. I am gay, so I have a right to say this.<br/><br/>The worst distraction and aspect of this film is Emma Watson. She doesn't give justice to the role of Belle. You can see it in her eyes. This actress grew up with everything, having played Hermione. Belle is a sweet, innocent provincial lass. Every time I look at Emma Watson, it seems like I am waiting for her to roll her eyeballs or take out a cellphone and tweet.<br/><br/>Dan Stevens looked effeminate and his beast form should have been a bird and not a mammal. Josh Gad looked mechanical, uninspired and unconvincing as gay LeFou. <br/><br/>I watched this film because I was afraid I would miss out on something historic or a good film sequence.

","Amazed!!<br/><br/>Probably the best word I can use to describe my feeling upon watching the film in theaters. It truly was an excellent film. It certainly had some originality, even though it was a remake of the 1991 animated classic. The characters were well driven, and came to life, more realized than I could have imagined.<br/><br/>I still feel the animated version is far more superior, but this is definitely a close second. The acting wasn't terrible, however, Emma Watson is the most memorable as Belle. She was great. A great step for her, from the days of Hermione in the Harry Potter series.

Turn it into a musical is one. But turn it into a live-action version with practically nothing changed (though a few scenes added) may not be your best idea. Especially if such a version relies on CGI and you have neither the time nor the ability to pull it off.<br/><br/>But if you are going to do it anyway, I suppose you could do much worse. Emma Watson was the ideal casting choice and no one else would have worked. No one. Josh Gad is spot on as LeFou. The Beast could be better, perhaps. My biggest casting complaint is Maurice.

This movie is everything the animated version was and so much more!<br/><br/>The live action movie follows the animated movie very closely.

The live action version has a few extra scenes than the animated version which adds to the backstory.

I was a little worried about a live action movie after always loving the original - I wasn't sure it would measure up. The music was wonderful and the new songs that have been added compliment the original soundtrack perfectly. The costumes are wonderfully colorful and bright and scenes are beautiful. Cinematography and the CGI effects were also very good and felt seamless. <br/><br/>There are so many things that make movies uniquely Disney and those qualities were evident in this movie too. The ""Be Our Guest"" scene had me flashing back to Fantasia for instance, and the overall magic of the film in all of it's beauty could really only be Disney. <br/><br/>I highly recommend this film."

","Up front: I'm probably not the right audience for this film. I only went because I was invited, and I wouldn't have gone to check this one out otherwise. <br/><br/>Firstly, some of the production values are really beautiful and reminded me of the animated classic in a good way. Also, the voice cast for the clock and the kitchen devices are great.<br/><br/>Secondly, the actors, well... this may sound kind of harsh, but I've never seen Emma Watson act so stiff in a movie. Her performance is wooden, which is pretty bad considering she's supposed to be the heart of the film. Also, she probably won't start a singing career anytime soon.<br/><br/>Thirdly (and most importantly), Beast. That's where they really dropped the ball. Giving him a lifeless CGI face was an unforgivable mistake, and it's such a constant distraction that I could never really get into the movie.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm afraid I wouldn't recommend this movie, at least not to adults. I'm sure most kids would enjoy it though, and it's not really a bad film: just a very mediocre one. 6 stars out of 10."

","""Just because you can, doesn't mean you should."" <br/><br/>I'm sure this won't be the last time I say this, but it needs to be said: Stop making movie musicals with people who can't sing. If they can't sing, drop the Autotunes and dub them. We have the technology; it's virtually painless. Non-singing actors have ruined 3 of my favorite musicals: Beauty & the Beast, Sweeney Todd, and Phantom of the Opera. In a musical, music is a character, and hearing Josh Groban sing ""Evermore"" over the end credits merely proved what was missing. <br/><br/>The overuse of CGI in films is creating a nightmare of quick cut, in your face visuals that are detracting from the overall story and quite frankly, giving me a headache. Again, CGI should enhance, not overtake your scenes and wrestle them and your actors into the ground. The same CGI that made ""Be Our Guest"" a thing of beauty in the 1991 version creates an on-screen, muddled mess here. In fact, the CGI detracted rather than enhanced this entire production. The cartoon characters showed more emotion than the flat, emotionless, and rather frightening faces here. <br/><br/>I'd rather not comment on the acting because it's hard to do that and not hurt people's feelings, and at the end of the day, actors are people, too. I will say that there is a reason Disney is now seriously recognizing and marketing their Villains. THEY ROCK. Oh, and Kevin Kline gets a pass because I love him. :-) <br/><br/>While others may love it, it simply wasn't my cup of tea."

I knew the basic fairy story since I was a boy but had at the time of the live action version being released had not seen the animated version. Because I enjoy film music I knew and have enjoyed various Alan Menken works so elected to get the new soundtrack (which has now been on a loop in my car and driving my passengers insane). I enjoyed the music so much that I soon set off to my local cinema and watched the new movie. So that makes Emma Watson my 'first' Belle and I thought she carried the whole film with great charm and style. <br/><br/>On reading the various reviews comparing the live action with the animated version I decided to next see the animated version and while enjoyable it, in my humble opinion, does not hold a candle (or should I say Lumierre) to the modern version.

At one point in an early song you could barely hear, let alone understand, the words of the main singer because the orchestral music was overpowering it. All throughout the movie the mixing sounded very uneven to me.<br/><br/>Luke Evans did not make a good Gaston. I've liked him in other movies but in this one his acting was more boorish than his character.<br/><br/>The effects for the non-human characters (except the Beast) were horrendous. It reminded me of the animation in the old Christmas shows like Rudolph the Reindeer, the Misfit Toys, Frosty the Snowman, etc. The effects were bad enough to be distracting (especially Mrs. Potts and Chip).<br/><br/>If your only reason for seeing this film is for the effects, do yourself a favor and skip it."
"room-06350","5","315","635","3 March 2017"," Overstuffed and lacks the charm of the original
","I was really looking forward to this film. Not only has Disney recently made excellent live-action versions of their animated masterpieces (Jungle Book, Cinderella), but the cast alone (Emma Watson, Ian McKellen, Kevin Kline) already seemed to make this one a sure hit. Well, not so much as it turns out.<br/><br/>Some of the animation is fantastic, but because characters like Cogsworth (the clock), Lumière (the candelabra) and Chip (the little tea cup) now look ""realistic"", they lose a lot of their animated predecessors' charm and actually even look kind of creepy at times. And ironically - unlike in the animated original - in this new realistic version they only have very limited facial expressions (which is a creative decision I can't for the life of me understand). <br/><br/>Even when it works: there can be too much of a good thing. The film is overstuffed with lush production design and cgi (which is often weirdly artificial looking though) but sadly lacking in charm and genuine emotion. If this were a music album, I'd say it is ""over-produced"" and in need of more soul and swing. The great voice talent in some cases actually seems wasted, because it drowns in a sea of visual effects that numbs all senses. The most crucial thing that didn't work for me, though, is the Beast. He just never looks convincing. The eyes somehow don't look like real eyes and they're always slightly off.<br/><br/>On the positive side, I really liked Gaston, and the actor who played him, Luke Evans, actually gave the perhaps most energized performance of all. Kevin Kline as Belle's father has little to do but to look fatherly and old, but he makes the most of his part. Speaking of Belle, now that I've seen the film, I think her role was miscast. I think someone like Rachel McAdams would actually have been a more natural, lively and perhaps a bit more feisty Belle than Emma Watson. <br/><br/>If you love the original, you might want to give this one a pass, it's really not that good (although at least the songs were OK). Also, I'd think twice before bringing small children; without cute animated faces, all those ""realistic"" looking creatures and devices can be rather frightening for a child."

Why they didn't chose the same director. This movie would have been huge!. I was sad. My little daughter was scared of the beast. She is 7 years old and kept crying. This is supposed to be a family movie. This movie didn't meet my expectations at all. Actors didn't show emotion while acting. It looks fake. I'm sorry; but it was disappointing."
"moonspinner55","3","39","68","1 April 2017"," Expensive but not expansive...everything money can buy or manufacture except charm and spirit
","Disney trying to top themselves. This live-action rendering of the studio's 1991 animated version of the oft-told fairy tale is Disney's way of giving family-friendly audiences a 'treat' while raking in big money the easy way: by delivery a presold product, one with name and song value--and built-in approval ratings. At a debutante ball in 18th century France, an old hag casts a spell on the partygoers after she is rebuffed (seems she's an enchantress in disguise, though we have no idea why); the selfish prince of the manor is then turned into a beastly creature, while his attendants are turned into (talking) objects. Her spell will be broken once the prince learns about true love, though this must happen before the last pedal on the enchantress's rose falls... Ideally, this material is timeless and should entertain those who do not know the story and approach it with a fresh perspective. However, while Disney's previous version broke new ground for animated musicals, this dark, lead-footed endeavor never lifts off, remaining flatly earthbound despite the familiar songs and characters. When trying for a little humor, scenarists Stephen Chbosky and Evan Spiliotopoulos cannot come up with anything other than dry sarcasm, which doesn't wear well on their princess Belle, played by a miscast Emma Watson. Whether feigning indignation or attempting to register awe, Watson approaches her part with a firm jaw and a righteous tone, as if this were a feminist mock-up; when she asks the Beast if he's joking when he offers his castle to her, she sounds like the captain of a cheerleading squad. The art direction and design of this preconceived blockbuster is fussy and forgettable--no one will come out of this movie saying that it transported them to another time and place--while the unobtrusive supporting cast plays it safe, perhaps so as not to be in competition with their animated counterparts. Somewhere, French filmmaker Jean Cocteau (who helmed the 1946 version, ""La Belle et la Bête"") is smiling, for trendy blockbusters come and go but art remains truly timeless. *1/2 from ****"

","An almost perfect adaptation with many subtle changes that many people will probably miss. What I dislike is the obvious ""gayness"" of LeFou. A magnificent marriage of live action, animation, and CGI. ""Agathe"" is the ""enchantress"" who changes the Prince into the Beast, and yet this is never quite obvious to the townspeople. Additional songs and reworked lyrics, plus a more complete ""background story"" about Belle's and the Prince's parents. Only one or two scary spots and a rather pleasing interpretation of the Beast in ""human"" form. Belle's father is portrayed as a very clever man and not as an absent-minded buffoon. Gaston shoots The Beast several times and it's ""almost bloodless"" Hollywood violence. In 1991, he stabbed the Beast to death. Gaston dies as he traditionally should; never by the hand of the Disney hero or heroine. When a film or stage-play is ""reborn"" it's impossible to please everyone, but this one tries very hard to do so. Amazing cinematography, costumes and art direction. An outstanding cast and very well performed. I thought Emma Watson was just fine. I want that White Stallion with his built-in ""GPS""! I miss the (extra) song ""Human Again"" and it should have been there! Enjoyable and entertaining ending titles. A great marketing idea would be the packaging of the 1991 animation and this 2017 version as a double Blu-Ray? For almost everyone except extremely small children.

In my opinion, B&tB tries a bit too hard to impress viewers of a new generation (predictable), and the use of auto-tune on the female lead was annoying and unnecessary (none of that that rubbish, or cast an actress who can actually sing well!) The new songs enhance the story but are altogether unmemorable. The live-action versions of Mrs. Potts and the rest of the enchanted objects looked so dainty and realistic, it was creepy and ""unmagical"" to me. As for the main characters, the writers did not even seem to give Gaston a chance. He was deeply unlikable from the beginning, so his characterization was not very well-rounded in this version (villains deserve even a bit of love/empathy).<br/><br/>There are enough remakes/reboots being made nowadays, and I find it upsetting that Disney ended up tampering with one of its classics.

Ok, for those of you not aware of Emma Watson's background She was born in Paris, France.

Belle and her father not being saved by Chip and their washing machine? And the last battle? People vs living furniture is my fave scene because it's so epic and in this film it's just ""that's it?"" and why need to change the 'cute Beast playing with bird in the snow' with 'playing with horse'? And last, Belle's changes. Belle is so beautiful and elegant, brave but gentle. In here, they changed her to not be woman enough. I know they wanted Belle looked strong but why need to remove her elegance? What's her doing with her skirt? Belle's dress is classic but in here it's so simple. It's gold not yellow. And oh my, Emma Watson really RUINED Belle by her acting. No emotion at all. Did she want to challenge Kristen Stewart with 'no emotion' acting? And why she's still using British accent? This movie background is in France. If Belle's British, where's her father's accent?<br/><br/>Oh I'm so angry, they ruined my childhood movie. I have another few complaints but I already said much.

The story-line is pretty much similar with the animated version, but with some nice background story additions about Belle's mother and the Beast/Prince's father. Also liked the linking of magical enchantress to the villager ""outcast"" commoner Agathe. The 3 new songs ""Days In The Sun"", ""How Does A Moment Last Forever"", and ""Evermore"" added nice depth and background to this live-action version.<br/><br/>The 2 acting performances which stood out were Emma Watson (Belle) and Luke Evans (Gaston). They both brought their animated characters to real-life as well as could be imagined. Emma Watson gave a charming, intelligent, sincere, and radiant performance as Belle. She performed her various singing moments admirably and with good emotion for a 1st time singer in a movie. It would be hard to imagine another actress who could have played this role of Belle as well as Emma Watson. She has made a nice transition from her childhood acting role as Hermione Granger in the Harry Potter movies to Belle in ""Beauty & The Beast"". Luke Evans gave an entertaining, profoundly over-the-top, and eventually villainous performance as Gaston. His singing prowess and theater background came through in his 2 musical numbers. Next to the CGI driven ""Be Our Guest"" and ""Evermore"", Gaston's 2 musical numbers were among the most memorable musical moments.<br/><br/>The other supporting cast members, from Ewan McGregor as Lumiere, Ian McKellan as Cogsworth, Emma Thompson as Mrs. Potts, and Kevin Kline as Maurice fit their roles very well and pitch perfect also. <br/><br/>The only reasons I only gave the remake 9 stars out of 10 are the Beast/Prince character and the ending felt a little rushed. As far as the Beast/Prince, his performance felt a bit too understated and smug at first compared to the animated version. His efforts to gain Belle's affection had more of a plan in the animated version than this live action version. The one scene where this difference stands out is when the Beast/Prince introduces Belle to his large library room. It is different and not as planned compared to the animated version. Also, would have preferred that the Beast had more human acting moments after his transformation back to a Prince. Dan Stevens still gave a very good performance as Beast/Prince, but just not up to the level of excellence as the rest of the cast. This brings me to the ending, which felt a little rushed. It would have been nice to extend the ending a little bit longer to get to know the human version of the castle characters after the curse was broken and their transformation back to human form was completed. Minor criticisms, but very few movies can be perfect...lol.<br/><br/>Overall, great live-action remake by Disney. Well-cast, beautifully performed, and expertly directed. After ""Beauty & The Beast"" and ""Jungle Book"", looking forward to more Disney live-action remakes. I believe ""The Lion King"" is up next."

","Obviously I was watching a different film to a lot of the other reviews here as I completely enjoyed the film. I loved the characters, Loved the music. Thought the cast was great and that the film flowed well.<br/><br/>Thoroughly enjoyed it from beginning to end a True Disney treasure. The special Effects were great and the musical sequences were fantastic and well sung, really enjoyed and cant wait the buy the Bluray."
"icpemsby","3","53","99","18 March 2017"," Wholly, and entirely underwhelming
","The original was a part of my childhood so I was excited for this movie ever since I heard about it. I did have some concerns though. Concerns that were present in every minute of this movie. A disappointment but the thing that I was most surprised by was there was no heart. Good actors and very little chemistry hurt this movie. However it will still make a billion dollars so I'm sure Disney will be fine. Disney is kicking so much butt that even their bad movies destroy at the box office."
"shawneofthedead","7","104","206","7 March 2017"," A good, though far from great, adaptation of this tale as old as time.
","Adapting Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Villeneuve's original French story about a beauty and her beast is no easy task. In the wrong hands, this romance between a girl and her captor could easily come across as creepy – Stockholm Syndrome parading as a fairy tale. Disney managed to pull it off in 1991: its sublime animated version, with its tender heart and gorgeous music, has rightly become a classic. 25 years later, has the studio managed to capture lightning in a bottle again, this time in live-action format?<br/><br/>Well not quite. To be fair, this brand-new incarnation of Beauty And The Beast, directed by Bill Condon, has a great deal going for it. It makes a good case for updating the tale with more modern sensibilities. The film is beautifully performed and designed, and there's plenty of fun (and nostalgia) awaiting fans of its animated predecessor. But it never feels quite as effortless or natural in telling its story. While there is magic here, it's tough to shake the feeling that it's engineered, not organic – that it grazes rather than grabs the heart.<br/><br/>The film centres on Belle (Emma Watson), a bookish, resourceful young lady who's never really fit into her little French village. She hankers for adventure – but gets more than she bargained for when her father (Kevin Kline) stumbles into a forgotten castle and becomes a prisoner there. After trading places with her dad, Belle gets to know the inhabitants of the castle: a surly, fearsome Beast (Dan Stevens) and a host of living household appliances and furniture, all of them living in fear that they will never be free of the curse that has robbed them of their humanity.<br/><br/>On its own merits, Beauty And The Beast is a decent effort. Condon's film is the Hollywood blockbuster at its most efficient, from its photo-real fantasy castles to splashy musical numbers teeming with life and colour. The screenplay, by Stephen Chbosky and Evan Spiliotopoulos, is a canny adaptation of familiar material, particularly when it comes to adding layers to its characters. Belle has more agency in ways big and small – she's the one in control even when she (voluntarily) becomes the Beast's prisoner and, in a small but important scene, she shares the gift of independent thinking by teaching a village girl how to read. <br/><br/>Similarly, the many relationships in the film are given welcome depth. Belle and the Beast find common ground in books and feeling out-of-place, even in the places they call home. We're furnished with hints as to why the household servants – including suave candlestick Lumiere (Ewan McGregor), jittery clock Cogsworth (Ian McKellen) and motherly kettle Mrs. Potts (Emma Thompson) – are more invested in breaking the curse that befell them. LeFou's (Josh Gad) devotion to the pompous Gaston (Luke Evans) goes, quite logically, from subtext to text, though in a way that hardly warrants the firestorm of controversy that has erupted in conservative circles over Disney's 'gay agenda'.<br/><br/>That said, other aspects of this remake yield more mixed results. The Beast's very real, very human eyes provide emotional connection and depth in a way that animation can't fully approximate. But burying Stevens beneath layers of CGI and prosthetics also means that the Beast can occasionally come across as a stiff, oversized teddy bear, lacking the fluidity of expression of his animated counterpart. The same goes for the household servants: ironically, efforts to make them more 'realistic' end up bleeding them of life and personality. <br/><br/>It's the same story with the film's music. Some of Alan Menken and Howard Ashman's iconic original numbers are thoughtfully re- imagined: 'Be Our Guest' is a joyous explosion of camp colour, featuring welcome nods to movies like Cabaret and Singin' In The Rain; and 'Gaston' morphs into a lively bar-storming number that practically demands applause at the end. <br/><br/>But the new songs, penned by Menken and Tim Rice, are more nice than necessary. 'How Does A Moment Last Forever' is lovely but lacks impact. 'Evermore' – a new anthem for the Beast – will no doubt become a cabaret standard but is badly served in the context of the film: it feels overwrought and a bit silly, lessening rather than heightening the dramatic tension at that particular moment. <br/><br/>Performances across the board are good, as you would expect from a cast of this calibre – though it's hard not to wish for accomplished performers like Thompson, McKellen and Broadway legend Audra McDonald (playing the part of an operatic, narcoleptic wardrobe) to be better served by both script and special effects. Watson, who has proved a better advocate than actor in recent years, is a perfectly credible (though hardly riveting) Belle. Stevens does a decent job with a challenging part, while Evans convincingly conjures up both swagger and menace.<br/><br/>It's evident in every frame that everyone involved in Beauty And The Beast worked mightily hard to prove that transforming one of Disney's most iconic movies into a live-action extravaganza is worth the effort. They don't always pull it off: the film gets about as many things wrong as it does right, and it most certainly doesn't surpass the animated classic in quality. But it tells a familiar tale well enough – enough, one suspects, to win over fans old and new."
"and-charalambous","7","20","33","20 April 2017"," It was OK-Good!
","I am not a fan of musicals but I went to watch this one out of nostalgia. I like the fact that they kept the original songs. Unlike a LOT of people in here, I did not mind the autotune because I didn't want to hear the voices of the actors if they were bad. Now people will complain about choosing a different cast then. The cast was final, end of story, get over it. Also unlike a lot of people in here I am really glad they did not change the story from the original. Since it is a remake I don't expect a whole new story that would totally ruin the original. Besides, with the money Disney has made, a 2nd one is definitely coming, you'll get your different story. The visuals were OK but could have been better especially Belle's village."
"chrisandjade-59663","6","5","6","30 July 2017"," Not that bad
","Just watched this. Feeling a little 'meh'. Huge fan of the original, my mum took me to see it as a little girl. Heres my opinion.<br/><br/>1. What the hell happened to Gascon?! The acting performance is very good but he is no longer the huge hunk of man he was. The original Gascon was almost aggressive with Belle but this one was slightly pathetic with her.<br/><br/>2. Emma Watson gives a sweet performance. Again though my issue is with her looks. Belle was a rich brunette with big brown eyes, not mousy. 3. Whats with the extra songs? they're atrocious and unforgettable.<br/><br/>Pretty much all that's wrong with it. On the plus side: 1.visually enchanting. 2. the romance still gets you<br/><br/>if anything, watch once, at least for the snowball scene"

"makri-marilena","1","27","47","12 May 2017"," Belle (Swan) and the Beast
","THIS MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS <br/><br/>It is really simple. <br/><br/>If they wanted to make a good movie, a really good movie they would take care of two things. 1. Belle. They would cast an actor who can actually ...act.<br/><br/>(After watching the movie it is pretty obvious that the only reason Watson landed the role is her pretty big fan base of teenagers from her Harry Potter films)<br/><br/>What we needed for Belle's role? <br/><br/>Fresh, energetic, with a smile that lights her face actress. <br/><br/>What we got? <br/><br/>The twin sister of Bella Swan that landed herself in medieval France. Seriously I was waiting for Edward Cullen to do a cameo from time to time. <br/><br/>Haven't watched miss Watson in Harry Potter films but this was just a disaster. <br/><br/>2. The Beast. <br/><br/>It was so.... distressing to watch a soulless face throughout the movie talking. Even at the peak of the Beast's story when he lets Belle go, and we suppose to see the agony, the pain, all I get is.... nothing. Soulless. <br/><br/>Flat. <br/><br/>Disappointing.<br/><br/>I am confused. Should the actor still work harder and deliver his role as a beast better or it is due that horrible CGI head that we can't appreciate his performance? <br/><br/>Either way, again, they could do a lot better. <br/><br/>To sum this up, soulless Beast x miscast Belle leads to this awful remake to a classic animated film that we all grew up to love. <br/><br/>Save your money and go watch something else."
"Amigo301","3","32","57","10 April 2017"," everything wrong with this movie (note: just my opinion)
","I went into the movie expecting an uninspired, yet beautifully animated movie that is exactly like the old animated one, just remade as a life action. Nothing exceptional, but nice to look at and maybe to get a bit nostalgic. If you expect that, you can forget it.<br/><br/>What i got was: Strange CGI: the characters, especially the servants looked plastic and almost creepy.<br/><br/>Some new information about the characters background stories (Belle's Mom) that were nice but didn't go into dept at all.<br/><br/>Old scenes remade, often they took all the atmosphere out of them, (like in the final battle, remember how epic it was, it rained and Gaston hit that statue while trying to find beast, and beast was moving around like a shadow, in the new version it lacks the suspense)<br/><br/>Bad singing technique: It often sounded rushed, emotionless and too serious. Also auto-tuned :((( is it so hard to get experienced singers that you need to make the computer do the trick? I was prepared not to be overjudgemental, but as the first singer opened their mouth, all I could do was shake my head. That is not good quality. (I am referring to the German cast)<br/><br/>Rushed moments and sloppy dialogue,<br/><br/>Bad humour: Some jokes were funny, but most of the time I was like, ""that was the most stupid thing I heard today, oh wait, it just got topped""<br/><br/>Emma Watson, who could kill a bear with her bare hands in a movie and I'd believe it, but her longing look at the end and her being a dreamy person... I don't buy it.<br/><br/>This was my impression, but hey, we all have different views on the world, so check it for yourself, if you don't believe me :p<br/><br/>something positive at the end: I liked LeFou, this actor was a great choice."

","I was hoping for something more for this movie. However the acting was: OK, the script was: OK, the visual effects and everything surrounding it is ...again OK.<br/><br/>It is a good re-edited version of Disnesys beauty and the beast cartoon movie but it wasn't as good as it could be. Nevertheless it is a good film you can watch with the children or with your girlfriend. <br/><br/>For me it was just an average movie, nothing spectacular or different, just an old Disney movie in a new dress so to speak."
"deepakyadavhp","7","142","292","1 March 2017"," Quite Average
","When you take on a classic like Beauty and the Beast for a live action movie which was also nominated for the Best Picture by the Academy you HAVE to make sure that the spirit of the original remains intact even if you can't make it as good. I know that one has to tweak a few little things to make it appropriate not just for the new generation but also as a live action movie though without making it look cheesy or over the top... which quite sadly was not the case with this one... it was directed by an Oscar winning director (who also directed a twilight movie which sucks) and a studio that has recently produced better than the original adaptation of the jungle book which I really love... so one wonders what must have gone wrong... that I think we will find out later but for now if I have to say something positive about this movie it would be its visual effects which were quite gorgeous if not entirely believable, the design of the CGI characters which were a reminiscence of the original ones, Belle played by Emma Watson though not as great as I wanted her to be, seems to have done her job. And even if the songs didn't flow as greatly with the story as it did before, you could still enjoy them. The choreography, set design and the costumes also stole the show along with the Humour because of its talented cast even if it seemed a little cheesy at places, it managed to make me laugh (especially Gaston) hence making it a better movie than it really was... I will give it a 7/10...<br/><br/>P.S.- You may enjoy it because of the nostalgia factor."

","I don't know about you guys, but I was left thinking ""What was the bloody point?"" and came out feeling underwhelmed as everything felt weaker compared to the 1991 original. Emma Watson is not very good as Belle, and they didn't change it enough to make it stand out like The Jungle Book or Pete's Dragon remake. Disney felt really lazy here, sadly. I hope we see more effort in the future rather than just 90% the exact same movie.<br/><br/>4.5/10"

It held true to the old Disney version (plus some) and evoked many memories of watching the animation with all three of my daughters as little girls.

"noelpadilla","10","17","28","17 June 2017"," Fabulous Live Action remake to a Disney Animated Classic
","Excellent live action remake to an animated Disney classic! Bought the movie on BluRay recently after seeing it in the theater a couple months ago. Pitch perfect casting of all the characters overall. Especially liked the performances of Emma Watson as Belle, Ewan McGregor as Lumiere, and Luke Evans as Gaston. Each performance brought their animated counterpart characters to life as well as could be imagined. Each member of the ensemble cast brought some realness and distinct personality to their characters in this live-action version. <br/><br/>From the charm, fearlessness, independence, and radiance that Emma Watson portrayed and embodied into Belle. To the enthusiasm, joy, and pure fun that Ewan McGregor embraced with Lumiere. From the brashness and over- the-top entertaining and villainous persona that Luke Evans brought to Gaston. The casting, acting performances, along with the CGI special effects, and the excellent directing together combined to make this movie a magnificent success. <br/><br/>FYI, to the earlier review poster, Belle (Emma Watson) does cry with somber sorrow and sadness in the ending scene when she thinks the Beast/Prince passes away. Before she declares her love for him to allow the Prince and the other castle characters to transform back to normal human form. Those are CLEARLY real tears coming out of her eyes, so Emma Watson portrayed and expressed the heartbreaking emotions of that climatic ending scene VERY WELL.<br/><br/>In the end, this live action version ""Beauty & The Beast"" will finish as one of the Top 10 grossing movies all-time revenue grosses earned at the box office. Both domestically and internationally worldwide overall. So based on those box office results, a vast majority people who saw this movie enjoyed, were entertained, and pleased with what they saw in the theaters. Highly recommend purchasing this movie in any format (BluRay, DV, Digital HD). A memorable live action remake and family movie for all generations."
"trublu215","5","98","199","16 March 2017"," When All is Said and Done, Everyone Deserves a Better Film Than This.
","The highly anticipated release of the live action remake of Beauty and the Beast had all the ingredients of a future classic. With the animated film approaching it's 25th anniversary, the hunger for something like this is unfathomable. Yet, when the lights go on and the credits roll, I was left feeling like I was swindled. The Bill Condon film looks and sounds beautiful but the film is very thin in live action form. Emma Watson is woefully underselling as Belle and Dan Stevens does the best he can under the CGI-laden Beast. There are many issues with the film at the heart of it but one thing sticks out like a sore thumb: the complete and utter lack of originality.<br/><br/>The film does nothing in the way of introducing anything new to the age old story. The film is literally almost a shot for shot remake of the animated film. While die hard Beauty and the Beast fans along with their kids will probably enjoy the film, those looking for an extra layer will leave sorely disappointed. Despite this, the film does offer some explosive moments of action that are extremely well choreographed along with Josh Gad's wonderful performance as the comic relief that, despite his performance being marred with controversy, ends up being one of the stand-outs of the group. Then there are the musical numbers and these renditions are just as magical as it was in the 1992 animated film. They're infectious little numbers that are bound to be hummed for days after seeing the film. Despite these very positive attributes, the film just misses the mark and never rises to be more than just another remake.<br/><br/>Overall, I was very disappointed by Beauty and The Beast. I thought Bill Condon's best work is left to be desired, the two leads are very much so miscast, and the film offers nothing new in the way of a remake. However, if these things don't bother you, it is still a good family movie that can entertain for a solid 2 hours but will do very little outside of that. Is it worth going to see in the theater? No but if you have kids, chances are you're going to be dragged to it anyway so just try and enjoy it for what it's worth."
"speedcanary","10","108","221","18 March 2017"," An Absolute Delight!
","I'm rating this so highly (10 stars!) because I feel it is deserving of the highest praise. To see so many reviewers berating this film is quite a shock. I don't see anything controversial about the tale as old as time. In fact, I see lessons that people of all ages can learn from. Not to judge others based on their appearances is one of those lessons of note.<br/><br/>I wish to commend the cast and crew at bringing this to screen in such a grand and epic way. The music is beyond wonderful. I love Audra McDonald's singing, and I would love to hear even more. My favorite musical number was ""Be Our Guest!"" That was an absolute spectacle and a dream to behold. <br/><br/>Emma was the perfect Belle. If I were in casting, she is the actress that would have been my number 1 pick. She is the main reason why I wanted to see this film. She sings quite nicely, and I wasn't expecting that. In fact, I didn't expect this movie to be so musical. I really do not remember much from the original 1991 animated film. I know I saw it when it came out (I was a young one).<br/><br/>I was very surprised to see so many adults, especially baby boomer/retired age in the theater too. There were more adults than children! I wonder what drew them?<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie if you are a fan of Disney, of musicals, of the original animated film, or Emma Watson. It was an nice refreshing breath of air and break away from our current political climate."
"bogdandim","1","26","46","15 May 2017"," Miscast of Belle, bad acting is distracting
","I wish they had chosen a real actress to portrait Belle - not just someone who is there only because she is famous. I wish I had seen an actress who has talent and can actually act, sing and show emotion and some effort into the role.<br/><br/>The original movie was amazing, and it has always been one of my favorite Disney movies! Disappointed."
"Sweetigal85","10","20","34","29 May 2017"," A stunning masterpiece
","There are almost no words for how amazing this movie was, but I am going to try my best anyway! If you are a true fan of the original film, there is no possible way you will not adore this movie. It brings wonderful additions and insights to the original story and the entire film is really just a feast for the eyes. The music will fully engulf you and make you feel like you are there with the characters.<br/><br/>Emma Watson is visually the perfect Belle and portrays the part beautifully. Her singing is of course not as good as Paige O'Hara but I really didn't feel like her lesser voice mattered much in the film. They definitely needed to lower some of the keys and change some of the notes in order for Emma Watson to perform some parts of the songs but you could tell that she worked really hard to train her voice as best as she could and it resulted in a very pleasant sound.<br/><br/>Luke Evans is great as Gaston, though I do not feel that any actual human man could play Gaston perfectly. Gaston is a huge, hulking man and refers to himself as a specimen. In the original, he is able to throw Lefou around like a pillow and he lifts the blond triplets and the bench with one arm with ease. He has a deep, booming voice and he is ""roughly the size of a barge."" Does any actual actor come to mind with any of those phrases? Luke Evans definitely had Gaston's narcissism, rudeness and viciousness down. But I personally did not feel like he was unbelievably handsome, big or brawny. But I was still very pleased with his performance.<br/><br/>Josh Gad absolutely stole the show from Gaston as Lefou. He added depth to the character who was really just comic relief in the original cartoon. He sung ""Gaston"" in the tavern perfectly, it was really like the animation was just transferred to real life. I hope he gets the credit he deserves for that role. Certainly blows Olaf from Frozen right out of the water! Kevin Kline was a surprisingly wonderful Maurice and I really felt the love between he and Belle. I loved the additions they made with her mother and why Belle was so enchanted by roses to begin with. I'm glad they made Maurice more serious in this version, he was very goofy in the cartoon.<br/><br/>Dan Stevens was wonderful as the beast and they added a surprising amount of humor to his lines. I at first didn't like that he knew how to read but I suppose it never made sense in the original that a prince didn't know how to read. My favorite song was the one he sung when Belle leaves, that was breathtaking. I thought he was the perfect handsome prince too, especially his eyes.<br/><br/>There were a few additions I did not care for but I did not feel should take away from the rating. I wish Gaston had died the way he did in the cartoon, right in front of Belle who chooses to save the beast and does not even give Gaston a second glance as he plummets to his death. I also wish that the enchantress was NOT present during the beast's transformation back into the prince. I found that unnecessary and intrusive, that was supposed to be Belle and the Prince's moment. I also found it very strange and annoying that they did not speak to each other at all, they just stared at each other and then kissed. I preferred the original there, but these are just my preferences.<br/><br/>I also felt like the servants gave away WAY too much to Belle in this version. It was almost shocking that Belle wasn't able to figure out what was going on herself with all of the info they let slip. All the little characters were wonderful, particularly the wardrobe.<br/><br/>Overall, it is a truly breathtaking movie, one that only comes along once in a blue moon. You will be amazed how they literally transferred some parts of the cartoon directly into live action. They used the same music, same background noises, dialogue, EVERYTHING...for the most part.<br/><br/>Don't miss out on this. You should really just drop whatever it is you are doing and go see this move now! Outstanding!"

","I first saw the live-action adaption of Beauty and the Beast on opening night at a cinema-capri at one of the Harkins Theaters near me.And when I first saw the first seen with the prince becoming the Beast and seeing Belle sing for the first song of the movie,I instantly felt amazed by the movie.And this is one of the only live action remakes of a movie that is a very beautiful movie.And I love how the movie has a song for the beast and how it reminds me of let it go of how it shows how the beast feels about belle leaving but knows that she will always stay with him in his heart.And also the scene where the beast dies from his injury and all of the castle staff turn into lifeless objects,I felt tears coming from my eyes by how much the characters mean too me.But the part when the enchantress saw how much Belle loves the Beast and it was already too late,she used her magic turn the beast and everybody else back into humans and how the prince/beast and belle are reunited and share true love's kiss and the castle goes back to normal,the scene was so beautiful and amazing.It's my favorite movie of the year and it's a great adaption of one of my favorite Disney animated movies of all time.10/10"

","Never seen any previous version. So I get to give a unbiased view.<br/><br/>The music is the worst turn off for this film, the lyrics were instantly forgettable, the score was boring and the main leads voice was far too over produced and stripped of the human aspects that really carry a performance. <br/><br/>It had nice costumes, the cgi was passable though I felt cheated at the end when all the characters changing happened off camera - safe option.. but boring.<br/><br/>Acting was a little forced but fine, the pace felt OK.<br/><br/>The overall feel of the movie was mildly entertaining."
"jessseta","5","86","176","16 March 2017"," Flat and kitschy
","Oh man, I really wanted to like this movie. I'm a die-hard Disney fan and Beauty and the Beast is by far my favorite, I know it like the back of my hand having watched it a hundred times. It was really Disney's masterpiece. I went with a group of five 6-12 year old girls and we had made it a pretty big event...the little girl in me was SO PUMPED.<br/><br/>As much as I love Emma Watson, she was sorely miscast in this adaptation. Really all I could see was Hermione popping through constantly. I love her quirks, but they didn't come off as Belle's strange, feisty quirkiness. Really in the opening scene in the village, nothing about her came off as ""strange"" at all even though the townspeople are singing about how strange she is. Actually she seemed normal and THEY seemed strange. And while she can sing to an extent, it lacked Paige O'Hara's richness and emotion. And the odd delays in between the words in the song lyrics drove me absolutely insane. I'm all for making a classic song new, but the original is hard to top as it is and the little changes that were made almost seemed to make fun of it. If you can't make it better, then stick to the meter and timing of the original at least and don't try to change it at all. The crowd- supported parts of the songs were the best because they stayed the truest.<br/><br/>The CGI I felt was actually pretty good, but the character design was Just. So. Weird. They didn't have to look like the original characters but they didn't have to look creepy... I guess when you need to make an actual object come alive, maybe there's really no way to do with WITHOUT some creepiness. Beast's design really just didn't do it for me but it wasn't entirely awful. Really it was his lines and demeanor that ruined it for me. The voice acting in the original was full of emotion and granted you can draw a character to have any facial expression and emotion you want....but is it really so difficult to find actors that can do the same? Emma is beautiful of course but she isn't Belle, just like Dan Stevens is a great actor but he's not Beast. Rachel McAdams or Natalie Portman, while older than Belle's character, both could have fit this role and have the look. I'd have picked someone like Bradley Cooper for the Beast...again older than Beast's character but he still has that ruggedness and boyishness about him.<br/><br/>It wasn't so much the CGI that bothered me but the flat and awkward line delivery. It didn't feel natural, it didn't feel emotive. Actually the whole movie felt just really really awkward. I thought maybe the ending might make up for it, I had really hoped for that heart wrenching roar the beast lets out as Belle is riding away that would defibrillate some life back into it, but instead he sang an awkward song which may or may not have been part of the original Broadway play? Look your girl is riding off and you're doomed to remain a beast. That warrants a roar, not a song. Okay, maybe the transformation scene would change things....it started off riveting and promising....but then when he lands on his feet (instead of a dramatic ""dead"" crumple, only to heave a new breath of life and rise up again) he just has this dopey and ridiculous look on his face. I actually laughed out loud.<br/><br/>LeFou was great. Controversial maybe, but seriously it was so subtle that it's going to fly over the head of anyone under the age of 11. I can't think of anyone better to play him really, and even Luke Evans as Gaston was mildly entertaining. The Kill the Beast number was the best of all of them, really. <br/><br/>The final dancing scene was really beautiful. Belle's dress and the roses on everyone's costumes was a nice touch.<br/><br/>I don't know. It felt forced and uncomfortable. It felt more like a high school play. My 6- year old enjoyed it and that's what matters, but in the end the original is by far superior."

","""Beauty and the Beast"" was stunning and gorgeous. Beautifully and artfully performed. Dazzlingly colorful and charming. Fresh and lighthearted. Wonderfully and magically enthralling. I laughed, I cried, I floated along with the music, I bawled and bawled as the spellbinding elegance and splendor took me to another place and time. I was 5 years old again enjoying the Wonderful World of Magic that is Disney, as if for the first time. I will gladly spend my money over and over to see that magic unfold. I willingly and happily concede Emma Watson to be Belle, for this generation of children, instead of Hermione. She has earned her place as a Disney princess and I applaud everyone who had a part in this piece of magic. Truly, Disney knows how to make us all children again."

"jw-1901","9","12","19","17 October 2017"," Beauty and the Beast: Must Watch
","THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!!<br/><br/>Growing up, everyone would watch and talk about the magical Disney movies. Nowadays, Disney is remaking their classics, for example, Cinderella and Beauty and the Beast. The 1991 film, Beauty and the Beast, is ""a tale as old as time"" and provokes a feeling of nostalgia. Beauty and the Beast is one of my favorite movies because of the morals of the story, the cast, and the happy ending when they all turn back to humans. As one of the world's highest grossing film of all time, Beauty and the Beast follows a beautiful and independent young woman as she is taken captive in the castle of a hideous beast. Despite her fears, she befriends the castle's enchanted staff and overlooks the beast's grotesque exterior to learn the true heart of the cursed prince's gentle soul. This movie is one of the best adapted Disney films because of its magnificent casting, where the actors portray each character really well, and production, with the special effects and wonderful soundtrack. <br/><br/>The actors and actresses in this film brought the story to life. The talented actors cast in Beauty and the Beast are as close as it can get, appearance and personality wise, to the characters. The already independent and clever Emma Watson, known from the movie Harry Potter as Hermione, proved to be the perfect fit for the role of Beauty. Furthermore, the other casts fit their role really well. For instance, the brutishly handsome, yet self centered Gaston was portrayed perfectly by Luke Evans, as well as his magnificent and strong voice for the musical numbers. Although we cannot replace Angela Lansbury, the singer for Mrs. Potts, Emma Thompson, being Mrs. Potts, is the closest one can get to perfection. She gives the warm motherly advice with a soft spoken tone. These actors have brought to life the once animated movie, Beauty and the Beast, and is one of the most perfect cast for this production due to their talented acting and attention to the little details.<br/><br/>From the wonderful musical numbers to the talking household items, the production of this movie is absolutely spectacular. Even though it is a remake of the original 1991 film Beauty and the Beast, the movie still has a fresh feeling to it. The violent moments in the movie are intense and captivating, like the scene when the wolves almost killed Belle's father, Belle, and the Beast. Not only were there entrancing scenes, but the soundtrack was expanded. The opening of the song introduces the character and the village of not so bright characters. The most unforgettable piece was ""Be Our Guest"" where all the household items are brought to life by the gift of computer-generated imagery, or CGI. The moving candelabra, the ticking clock, the feather duster, and many other items appear realistic, even when moving and singing. It is hard to remember that they were just inanimate objects brought to life by the the magic of technology and special effects. Let us not forget the ""Tale As Old As Time,"" which was the finale that ended the movie with a sweet, happily ever after melody. Also, focusing on Cogsworth, ticking timepiece, and Lumiere, the candelabra, their friendship displayed in the movie was really something else. Their playful banter, like when Lumiere released Belle from the cell, to the exuberant rejoice at the end of the movie when the spell was broken really brightened up the mood and it seemed all so natural. There was not a single dull moment in this movie as the nostalgic and new scenes come together. <br/><br/>For these reasons, Beauty and the Beast is a must see movie because of its casting and production. From the perfect casting to the magical production and performances, Beauty and the Beast was one of the best produced movies I have ever seen. This movie also has beautiful messages that are very important. Beauty and the Beast taught people not to judge a book by its cover because looks can be deceiving. Because Belle took the time to become closer to the Beast, she found that he has a warm, kind heart who is a bookworm just like her. By not judging a book by its cover, she found her true love and lives happily ever after. There are many good reasons to watch this movie, but perhaps the best reason is for its musical performances. The talented cast truly gave it their all and have given us splendid performances. The overall production of Beauty and the Beast was absolutely wonderful and I strongly urge you all to watch it."
"karenbethyoung","10","12","19","7 June 2017"," Absolutely stunning and magical!
","Not sure why some adults with a thorn in their side have given this film a below average score, it was absolutely magnificent! From the moment it began you could feel the immaculate attention to the incredible details visually. Any Downton Abbey fan will revel with joy watching Dan Stevens as Beast. Emma Thompson as Belle was a perfect fit, and yet brought even more depth to the character. I watched with a smile on my face and a singing spirit to the favorite songs we know and love. I can watch this with my three year old niece, my 13 year old daughter, and my friends. In an age of trash TV and films that leave you despondent, Beauty and the Beast 2017 paints you with gold leaf tenderness and an abundance of giggles from Garson and La Foo. Cogsworth and Lumier are brilliant, Ewen McGregor was perfect. The cast was diverse, and open minded. The final scene visually blew my mind, and had my tween daughter jaw dropped. This is a one of a kind, beautiful film that all who made it should feel beyond proud to have created it for many future generations to experience and clap to. Bravo!"
"ecca-69274","4","56","112","17 March 2017"," Okay so I don't ever do reviews. But I couldn't keep my mouth shut with this one.
","Here you have one of Disney's most well loved and most successful masterpieces. To a lot of people, THE most loved. <br/><br/>So how can you go wrong with this one, right Disney? <br/><br/>That's what I thought at first. Then they announced the two main leads; Emma Watson as Belle, and Dan Stevens as the Beast. Come again? How on earth could Disney have got this so wrong? Who the heck was in charge of casting?<br/><br/>For the two main stars of the show, Belle and the Beast, you need STRONG leads. Emma Watson just got lucky being cast in Harry Potter. Is she one of the most talented actresses out there? No. Can she give us the same emotion Belle shows that we all grew up loving? No. Can she sing? Apparently not, because all I heard was this terrible auto-tuned voice in every song she sang. And it wasn't subtle either. What the heck Disney! Just because Emma grew up in Paris didn't make her 'the perfect Belle.'<br/><br/>Dan Stevens. I liked him in Downton Abbey. However, I would never in a million years thought to myself; ""He'd make a great live-action Beast."" Never! And oh gosh, his tacky CGI animation was just as bad as Emma's awful auto tuned voice. A big, CGI goat-man.<br/><br/>Also, age difference much? The kiss that they finally shared at the end was awkward, almost cringy, because Emma Watson looks like a teenage girl, kissing her nearly-middle aged school teacher or something. It was just weird.<br/><br/>How could you screw this up Disney? You had the money! Just, why?! The two main characters did nothing for me. I liked Belle's costumes more than I liked Belle. What does that say? Her clothes had more emotion?<br/><br/>Why was Belle viewed as 'odd' in her village full of weird characters? Bonjour was waaay too over the top. <br/><br/>Tale As Old As Time was too cockney. It may as well have been Mrs Lovett from Sweeney Todd singing it.<br/><br/>Also, Be Our Guest? How could you screw up Be Our Guest for crying out loud? Well Disney did that too. Great job guys.<br/><br/>Gaston. Is it only me who thought that the Villain stole the show? Because Luke Evens did for me. He was awesome. When they had first cast Luke Evens, I had a lot of doubts, but as I watched him on screen, actually SINGING (he can sing) and dancing and having fun with his role, I was sorry for ever doubting him. He and Josh Gad breathed life into the songs we already loved from the original. I loved their (slightly one sided) bromance.<br/><br/>I was hoping LaFou would be more 'animated' like he was in the original, because I thought Josh Gad was perfect for this role, but I still enjoyed him as a more real, toned down version.<br/><br/>Best things about this movie: The costumes. (I chocked up when I saw that yellow dress.) The score. (NOT the singing.) The cinematography. (Minus all the unnecessary CGI) The choreography. Gaston and LeFou. LumiÃ¨re's cute relationship with Plumette.<br/><br/>Okay I'm done. It's gonna take at least a week for me to get over this. Maybe I'll watch the original this weekend."
"funsterdad","9","13","21","3 October 2017"," Beautiful live action version
","I found this version of Beauty and the Beast to be quite refreshing. Tailor-made for the whole family to see, Emma Watson in the female lead (Belle) is a pure delight to behold. Vibrant colors provided for a stunning visual. The film approaches all emotional levels. The singing and dance sequences were most enjoyable. I've seen this movie picked apart by folks who I just think didn't want to like the movie and therefore exercised their critical writing ability to tear it down. I say, ""Thanks Disney Studios!"""
"posti-215-231550","9","13","21","29 July 2017"," I love this movie!
","When I heard that Emma Watson and Dan Stevens had been cast in the two lead roles, I was really excited to see the finished movie. And it absolutely didn't disappoint. Firstly, it seems as though it's cool to say that the animated 1991 version is better - after all, it was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture, right? But I watched it again recently, to get a true comparison, and this new version knocks it clear out of the park, in every way - music, acting, story-line, characterisation - all are, in my opinion, superior. There are 3 new songs in the movie, and they all absolutely add to the story and our understanding of the characters and their motivations. All of the leads (including the ""animated inanimates"", about whom there was little publicity but who are mostly A-List actors) are perfect in their roles, and not one of them doesn't ring absolutely true. Emma Watson strikes a wonderful balance between girl and woman, and Dan Stevens is somehow able to make us feel empathy with the Beast, even at first meeting, by conveying how tormented he is. Later as the Beast relaxes with Belle, we see his humanity resurfacing more and more, and somehow it IS perfectly conceivable that Belle could love him. I also found Luke Evans' characterisation of Gaston so much better than 1991's Gaston; here, we see the character's arc from arrogant, conceited (but not actually bad) pin-up of the village to enraged, scorned suitor who turns to evil when he doesn't get what he wants; this is in contrast to the one-dimensional character we see in the 1991 film. Both Evans and sidekick Le Fou (Josh Gad) bring real wit and humour to their roles, and as a bonus, Luke Evans' singing voice is truly fabulous! Speaking of music, the soundtrack is really lovely; all of the leads (including those not recognised as singers) bring skill and feeling to the songs they sing, and for me, Emma Thompson's ""Tale As Old As Time"" is truly beautiful - I greatly prefer it to Angela Lansbury's rendition. Naturally, this is, at its heart, a fairy tale, so some suspension of disbelief is necessary. And there are a couple of plot holes (how did they get through editing?! They're the only reason I didn't rate the movie a 10 out of 10) Emma Watson's extensive experience in acting for green screen (in the Harry Potter franchise with all of its special effects) is evident in her relaxed and realistic interactions with Lumiere, Cogsworth, Lumette, Mrs Potts and Chip (in their non-human forms). And the final ballroom scene is sumptuous but more than that, absolutely joyful. For me, this movie begs the question: if Disney had had access to the effects and CGI that are now commonplace in movie-making, would he ever had made all the fairy tale movies he did as animations, when real people can rouse so much more empathy and feeling in an audience? I know I am not the only person who had a tear in my eye at the scene where the servant characters finally lost their humanity and became (albeit temporarily) the inanimate objects they had inhabited. And Belle's tears over the body of the Beast were heart-rending and utterly believable. Overall, for beauty, gorgeous music, laughter and just a wonderful romantic tale with a happy ending, this movie is hard to beat."

"npadilla-61178","10","16","27","26 June 2017"," Excellent movie/live action remake to an animated classic!
","Excellent movie/live-action remake to an animated classic. Saw it twice in the theater and just bought the BluRay/DVD/Digital HD movie combo pack this week. Great performances by the entire cast, especially by Emma Watson as Belle, Luke Evans as Gaston, and Ewan McGregor as as Lumeire.<br/><br/>Emma Watson gave an overall fine performance as Belle, her singing was probably the ""weakest"" part of her portrayal. She has a pleasant singing voice, just not the vocal range compared to the other character roles and cast members in movie. The opening number when she was introduced as Belle sounded nice, but was a bit over-produced and ""auto- tuned"". To be fair, all the cast members singing vocals in the movie were likely ""auto- tuned"" and processed to varying extents. That is the nature of a movie and sound studio production, especially in a musical driven version. So to focus critiques only on Emma Watson's vocals as being ""auto-tuned"" in the opening scene introducing Belle's character seems objectively unfair. Her later singing moments as Belle in the movie got noticeably better and sounded more natural as the film went along. Her best singing scene was her last section, during the somber ""How Does A Moment Last Forever"" portion when the Beast/Prince brings Belle to Paris, France using his enchanted magical book to the small château where Belle's mother passed away from the plague when she was a baby. She exuded an emotional and natural singing voice to capture and portray that sad somber moment very well during that scene of the movie. Emma Watson's sincere acting, charming persona, radiant appearance, and admirable vocals for a 1st time singer in a movie musical combined to superbly embrace and embody her role as Belle with graceful style.<br/><br/>Overall, fabulous and enchanting performances by the ensemble cast. Great work on the production, direction, and CGI special effects by everyone involved in the movie. Well done!"
"tamaradus","3","29","54","29 March 2017"," Disappointed.
","Beauty and the Beast is by far one of my most favourite movies. The story it portrays, the music and magic and morals knowing that love heals all, unfortunately, I only saw and felt all that from the animated version and not this one. This movie lacked the good old ""warm and fuzzy"" feeling you get from Disney's animated movies, it lacked ""heart."" It just seemed a little emotionless and forced, some bits even seem rushed, other parts had nothing to do with the original at all. I was looking forward to see how Beast would be as a ""realistic"" version but they didn't capture Beast's imagery or personality at all and I feel the same way about Emma Watson playing ""Belle"" I like Emma Watson, she is a great actress but she is no ""Belle."" I wanted to like this movie and I was hoping for the same satisfaction as I got from the animation, but I couldn't. I have been a Disney fan all my life but I think Disney should have left this one alone, sorry but the animation was better."
"smartljd","3","26","48","2 April 2017"," Disappointed
","Had high hopes for this film since it was my fave as a child plus with it being a timeless classic. Came out with mixed views. I thought the overall cast seemed forced and a bit bland for the most part and generally didn't do the original characters justice from a personality side of things, I was really hoping to see Cogsworth and Lumiere bicker with each other a lot more as I remember in the Animation. Overall acting and singing of all was OK throughout but lacking convincing emotion. My favourite character was Gastarn . <br/><br/>The sequences of scenes were jumpy and didn't blend very well and script was word from word to the original which was OK but it couldn't have hurt to add a few extras to make it more fluid and natural. <br/><br/>Overall like others have said it could have been a big success but personally I'd stick to the original."
"dOctoRnMisSy","3","36","70","21 March 2017"," Changes make it less feminist, sorry
","I am going to say it. For all Disney's recent ""updates"" they have not quite figured how to actually write a feminist love story. The older ones were better, and the strength of their females was allowed to speed for itself. The old 1991 film is much better in this area. <br/><br/>In this one, it is stated that Belle will need to marry a man who can provide for her when her father dies, something that is not in the original film. This actually happened to female intellectuals of that era. They could be smart, but could never use their intelligence to help provide for their family. Nannerl Mozart was supposedly as talented as her brother Wolfgang, but had to quit performing once she married. So, Belle still has to marry a rich man to help her. <br/><br/>There was that Maleficent film several years ago,where the three strong female characters, the fairies, where transformed into bumbling idiots. And in the original film, aurora's parents showed true love by sending her away for 16 years, and not see her for her own safety. Which was probably extra difficult for them since she lived just outside the village.in the ""feminist"" one, her mom dies and dad is a villain. <br/><br/>Somehow, the newer ""feminist"" updated films have seemed to make their female characters weaker. They can include songs in their films poking fun at true loves kiss and love at first sight and keep the princess single all they want to, but it means nothing's if they can't actually figure out how to make the princess wife, mom, provider, Queen, etc. <br/><br/>And don't get me started on how mean he is to bell up until she is attacked by the wolves. And none of the castle servants family can help them break the curse? Please! And be our guest was not nearly flashy enough. Gastons character seemed inconsistent, and monsieur d arque wasn't creepy enough.<br/><br/>The old songs felt crammed in there too. I have seen the Broadway show 3 times."
"2001ASOfan","3","29","55","21 March 2017"," Nice to look at, and listen to, but not engaging
","Frankly, this new live-action version of ""Beauty and the Beast"" was one of the bigger disappointments in recent memory, eclipsed only by how much I disliked ""Kong: Skull Island"" just last week. There is so much apparent hard work showing on screen and audibly, with gorgeous costumes and a beautifully-orchestrated and performed musical score (the orchestra's part in it), but it barely registered for me as an engaging, exciting, vibrant, or touching film--the exact opposite of the pure, exhilarating joy that was the all-animated ""Beauty and the Beast"" this is being compared to. I love musicals, have since I was a kid, and paid extra to see this new live-action version in a large-format theater known for great sound and picture near me--and it was a huge waste of money at nearly $15 a ticket. I found myself studying the costuming and just listening to the orchestral score to pass the time, and lamenting the CGI-animated Beast's walks, leaps, and dancing, as it was so herky-jerky it felt like old stop-motion animation throughout (which, ironically, was somehow more effective in its obviousness). There is so much more to complain about, but I'll stop here--just know that I wanted to love this film, wanted to be transported the way musicals sometimes do transport audiences so well, and ended up fidgety and bored, checking my watch to see how much longer it could possibly be."
"danielrobertgriffin","3","34","66","19 March 2017"," Many misses
","The director hit the targets he was aiming for, it's disappointing that a quality film was not on the list. It seems the movie just assumes that you will care about the characters. I found very little to like in the character development. The times where the creators thought he was driving home a successful point the scene stinks of silly politics and I heard giggles throughout the theater. A bright spot was beast's sad solo which was a great (albeit unintended) comic touch. I am pretty confused about the higher ratings online. As a lifelong Disney fan I really can't think of a more poorly made Disney movie. To be fair the visuals were absolutely stunning, visually this was a real treat. I very much appreciated the that the set was stylized to perfection. It's very ironic that there is such a tip of the hat to reading when the illiterate are perhaps the only ones that will truly appreciate this poorly timed mess. The one save for the loss of my evening is that I did now have expose my 4 year old girl to this mess."
"fairb101","4","46","93","17 March 2017"," Tale as Trite as Time
","Even as somebody who has still yet to see the original 1991 Beauty and the Beast, something seems fishy to me about Bill Condon's brand new flesh and blood version. From the very first scene where our arrogant prince (Dan Stevens) rejects the wrong witch and gets transformed into a beast something rings inauthentic. It is as if this movie murdered the original and is now wearing its skin, parading out in public as it tries to convince everybody that it's still the person they remember. It's all a bit scummy, really. <br/><br/>Stop me if you've heard this one. Belle (Emma Watson) is the black sheep bookworm of a small French village dreaming of bigger things. When her father (Kevin Kline) goes missing, she discovers they he's been captured by the aforementioned beast and sacrifices herself so that he can return home. Under the care of the beast and his group of enchanted household applian - - <br/><br/>waityou have heard this one? OK, I'll stop.<br/><br/>The lifeblood of Beauty and the Beast ultimately lies in whether or not the romance between Belle and her hairy liege ends up working. It's a relationship that's been so normalized by pop culture but on paper, it's pretty strange stuff. That's exactly how it comes across in this version, strange. The beast's transition from rabid rage machine to kindly bookkeep feels entirely too rapid. We never see why Belle could think of him as any more than a friend and a reluctant one at that, considering that he, you know, kidnapped her. It certainly doesn't help that Watson is as dull as dishwater here. While she's certainly proved herself a more than capable actress in her post-Harry Potter career, she seems terrified to inject her Belle with any personality that isn't written on the page. As such, she has little to no chemistry with Stevens, who only fares a little bit better. While he certainly has the screen presence and the deep, resonant voice that the beast requires, his performance gets buried under an atrocious CGI design that never feels the least bit intimidating. He looks like he'd be more at home in Land of the Lost than $160 million dollar movie. <br/><br/>Fortunately, the supporting cast is much stronger. Luke Evans is having the time of his life as the bravado fueled Gaston, who is only bolstered by genuinely hilarious interplay with Josh Gad's LeFou. When these two are on screen, we see hints of the boisterous musical extravaganza this movie could have been if it wasn't so concerned with being somber whenever Belle and the Beast are on screen. Ewan McGregor and Ian McKellen are also quite a bit of fun as Cogsworth and Lumiere, even if McGregor is constantly fighting against an atrocious French accent. Although, it's hard to fault him for trying, which is more than I can say for the rest of the cast. Seriously, if French actors are on the Hollywood blacklist, can we just set the next ""French"" musical in England? <br/><br/>Bill Condon (Dreamgirls) certainly knows his way around a musical. The numbers here are elaborately choreographed and well sung for the most part. Each song establishes its own unique aesthetic, from Gaston's bouncy barroom to Be Our Guest's Bollywood esque light-show. Condon's camera captures most of the action in wide takes, even if some of the editing is a little fast. However, the pacing of the musical numbers is thrown off with the addition of four new songs, all of which are rather melancholy and bland. <br/><br/>Unfortunately for Condon, this may be the ugliest looking big budget movie on the market. The character design, in particular, is borderline terrifying at times. They possess none of the vibrance and charm of the original animated versions, proving that some characters just don't translate to live action. Watching a real life candlestick with a face bounce around the screen is consistently off-putting, establishing a constant sense of disconnection from the characters even when the writing occasionally brings some charm out of them. <br/><br/>While Beauty and the Beast is slavishly devoted to the film it is trying to emulate, it still feels like a tonally confused mess. It bounces back and forth from a dour romance to an enjoyable romp and ultimately undercuts both. While there is certainly potential for these Disney live action remakes to be worthwhile, they're going to need to veer more in the direction of Jon Favreau's adaption of The Jungle Book. That film was bold enough to create its own version of the story while still recapturing the essence of the original. Meanwhile, Condon's film is limply crafted and terrified of taking risks. It's a tale as trite as time."

","I didn't want to see this movie because I felt it was going to be an exact play by play of the 1991 animated film. And I was right. It was a live action version of the animated film done exactly the same way. Nothing changed and what was added was completely forgettable and I just didn't care. I like Emma Watson but in this her acting felt forced and I think she was miscast. I didn't buy that she was in love with the beast and I didn't buy that the beast was in love with her. Speaking of which the CGI for the beast and everything else I thought was just horrible, cringe worthy, and distracting.<br/><br/>The beast was not a beast at all and what I mean by that is I wasn't frightened or disturbed, he even had a musical number that I also thought was cringe worthy. The beast in the animated version was beastly, terrifying, stubborn and you hated him, so it was great watching him transition and change into a softer gentler beast.<br/><br/>I did like moments like seeing how the castle curse effected not only the beast but how it effected the staff and so forth. Every time a rose petal fell the characters slowly became more and more like antiques so I felt somewhat sympathetic.<br/><br/>The music and the score were also good but other than that there's nothing else I can really say about this movie. Its not memorable I wouldn't watch it twice. Its the same exact movie just go watch the animated version its leagues better."

","This is just horrible, cringe-worthy comes to mind.The ""new"" musical scores stand out in nauseating contrast to the much better original songs. I don't know who writes these musical scores but this is not the first ""musical"" to strike my upchuck cord. It must be some new style, sing your script as badly as you can manage. Les Miserables (the new one) was the first thing that popped into my head when I heard the first terrible addition to the score. Even good actors can't help this kind of writing. <br/><br/>If the singing wasn't bad enough the CGI will certainly send you into the realms of disbelief. One would think that Disney would be able to hire competent 3D character artists and animators. The ""beast"" looks completely unbelievable, hell, it's anatomy doesn't even flow correctly. This reliance on CG for everything is killing the industry. Why do you need CGI wolves? <br/><br/>All in all, I wouldn't give this piece of money grabbing puke more than a 5/10.

","It's incredible how lifeless this live-action adaptation (with real, breathing humans) is compared to the 1991 animated version. The efforts to make the love story more believable were appreciated, but still fell way short and the effort was barely there in terms of writing and acting. The visuals were unimpressive at the least to downright ugly in some. (A simple example would be the rose, just sadly trapped in glass, not even glowing. Lifeless.) The musical pieces were bland, nothing really special, like the commitment was just halfway, just something they had to do. (Be Our Guest was especially disappointing: badly designed, choreographed and directed that really, you would beg to just watch the animated version again instead.) I would've cut some of those additional songs as well. The singing, except for 6-time Tony Award winner Audra McDonald, was mediocre. Autotune was definitely used for a lot of them, but you can especially tell with lead Emma Watson. The acting was also all over the place. Out of the actors we see on screen, only Luke Evans really commits to his role, his best moments being in the first half of the movie. Dan Stevens' performance is hard to decipher, since his voice was heavily edited for Beast, and his face is completely CGI. Also eye roll-worthy were the fake French accents some voice actors had to use while others retain their own English accents, and Mrs. Potts voiced by Emma Thompson had a cockney accent. Remember that everyone is in France anyway. Either hire French actors or just drop the 'accent' entirely. This movie was nothing but a complete cash grab for Disney, and the box office numbers will unfortunately let them keep making movies this empty."

Beast did not look intimidating like he did in the orin ginal, & Chip & Mrs. Potts have human faces on them, which looks HORRIBLE. But I'm most angry that Emma Watson was chosen to play Belle. Her singing & acting absolutely sucks, & she had a blank/emotionless face the whole movie."

Get your historical facts straight! There may be a time and place for diversity, but this is not it!<br/><br/>The story was bland and lifeless, the only good thing that earns the movie 2 stars was Josh Gad as Lefou, he was hilarious! Sir Ian McKellen made me laugh after the transformation, he looked so uncomfortable being in this crappy movie, lol."

","Beauty & the Beast is a beast of a movie whose only purpose is to cash into the original. Why even make a remake to Beauty & the Beast anyways? The original is a nearly perfect and timeless classic! Anyways, let's bash this blunder.<br/><br/>What's the story? An arrogant prince is cursed to live as a terrifying beast until he finds true love. Strangely, his chance comes when he captures an unwary clockmaker, whose place is then taken by his bold and beautiful daughter Belle. Helped by the Beast's similarly enchanted servants - including a clock, a teapot and a candelabra - Belle begins to see the sensitive soul behind the fearsome facade. But as time runs out, it soon becomes obvious that Belle's cocky suitor Gaston is the real beast of the piece.<br/><br/>Okay, let's talk about the 2 good things about the movie: first, let's talk about the design of the Beast's castle. While most of the other CGI looks absolutely rancid (which I will get to later on), at least, at the VERY least, they put careful attention to detail on the castle, making it look absolutely gorgeous and unbelievably breathtaking. The other good thing about the movie is Josh Gad as LeFou. He's a very funny and energetic sidekick, and as a bonus touch, he's actually... well, you all know. Let's just say he's a different kind of person. Also, he's one of the only non-British characters in the entire film. Which leads to the elephant of the room about the movie: the casting, except for Josh Gad, is HORRIBLE! I mean, COME ON! Emma Watson as Belle? Not only does she show absolutely ZERO emotion or care in her performance, but her singing is entirely AUTOTUNE. I mean, compare her singing with the original Belle. At least in the 1991 version, there's EFFORT in the performances and the singing. In here, however, it's like all the life and color of the original have been sucked out and replaced with slow and downbeat performances. (That is, except for Josh Gad.) Even the EXPRESSIONS are very pale and dry, and besides, it looks and FEELS like they're just lip-syncing and not actually singing. As for the CGI, it looks very bad for the most part (except for the castle), but nothing is worse than the design of the Beast. WOW. He's horrifying all right, but he's horrifying because his design is so AWFUL. When your ANIMATED Beast is more convincing than your LIVE-ACTION Beast, you know you're screwing up BIG TIME. As for the songs, the updated versions are the same as ever (not to mention this is a shot-for-shot remake of the original) and the new songs only exist to 1, pad the runtime, and 2, to sell soundtracks in stores and on iTunes. I thought Disney cared about their quality for a while, but nope! Turns out the real CEO of Disney is Mr. Krabs, and this film CLEARLY shows that.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Beauty & the Beast is very empty, boring, and is only made to turn in a profit. And apparently, they succeeded in that field, because it was a huge hit! No joke, people, it became the highest grossing domestic non-PG-13 rated film (that is, until Incredibles 2 came out) and it scored over a billion dollars at the box office. So they rolled in the dough with this one, but it didn't reflect in the quality. My suggestion is to stay out of this film and go check out the animated one instead. At least with that film, you'll have a much better viewing experience and you won't regret watching it. Even if you LIKED the original, this movie is the same exact thing, except if it was a downbeat and sorrowful live-action mess. In other words, if you liked the original, you'll definitely hate this one. If you DO wanna see this movie, I'm not stopping you or anything, but you'll love the original much better. What can I say but, there must be more than this provincial movie!"

","This review will be spoiler free, so you don't have to be afraid of spoilers and can read on if you like^^<br/><br/>Story line: Of course, this movie follows the story line of the Disney movie version, but what I really like is that they changed some things which didn't make sense in the original animated movie. They also give more information on the background of the characters and their families. Due to that I felt more into the movie and the story. They also added some hilarious joke lines between the romantic and serious moments of the movie.<br/><br/>Camera: The camera work was alright. Most of the time satisfying, but at some points, I would have wished a different perspective.<br/><br/>Transition: The transition therefore were great, awesome! Between summer and winter, day and night, it was just beautiful.<br/><br/>Setting: Of course the setting was also great. The village looked tiny and cute, the castle astonishing, scary, but beautiful at the same time. <br/><br/>Characters: A lot of people even complained about the actor for the prince before. But I thought, he was alright. I really liked his singing voice though. The other cast members were really good. Emma Watson was a perfect Belle and Luke Evans as Gaston was amazing! Even the side characters were well portrait.<br/><br/>Music: The music was of course wonderful. But for some people, who don't like singing in a movie...You shouldn't watch this one then. There were a lot of songs and even more than in the animated version. But they were all very well composed and beautifully sung.<br/><br/>Conclusion: I really liked the movie in a lot of aspects. What I have to complain about a little bit is the camera work and the cast for the prince. (Sorry...) All in all it's a really great movie which I would like to watch again any time."

","This 2017 action version of ""Beauty and the Beast"" is definitely worth watching base on my experience, because it remains a lot of classic Disney feature, such as its classic music style, plot, foreshadows and happy ending. I personally like its music the most, and I have the entire soundtrack in my phone, even memorized most of the lyrics (No joking). Moreover, there has been a change of attitude for myself to the movie when I was first time watching it. I had a hard time trying to convince myself keep watching it at the beginning, because I watched the trailer and I thought that's what the story about, but later on, there were unexpected changes that brought me back into it, and I actually learned a lot when I connect the story to the real life.<br/><br/>After all, I STRONGLY recommend this movie for all ages, despite there are some weird scenes that I'm thinking about that if we should really show it for kids with no doubts, since the kids will possibly mimic them at some point in their life and may be impolite to others.

","The age old story of Beauty and the Beast is a story that will continue to be told for generations. This new production bringing Beauty and the Beast into the modern honestly shocked me. At first I was very sceptical of what it would be like, will they adjust the story, will they ruin the image of the Beast, will Emma Watson play Belle correctly (for me anyway since she is essentially the focus of the film). All of these questions were racing through my mind. But. When I went to go see it I was quite astonished at what I watched. I was very very impressed with it. However I am critiquing this and as a result I though that Gaston was casted wrong, in the Disney original Gaston was a strong powerful man that was large in stature and was bulky. When watching the new 2017 version, Gaston was in good shape but he did not fit the description of the cartoon original. I mean I get it, he is a cartoon character and he was exaggerated for the audience and so on, but still come on, try to find a bigger guy. Other than that I cannot really think of anything else that I didn't really dislike. They nailed the iconic ball room scene as well as the playful: 'be our guest' scene. All iconic scene hit their mark and I cant say they let me down. I would highly recommend this film to anyone, family or friend. Follow me on Instagram @gabewatling and Twitter @gmwatling"

"seleuco","1","18","33","5 June 2017"," Did anyone look up ""France"" in wikipedia before making this?
","Let's get this straight straight: this movie is bad.<br/><br/>I have been looking for comfort in the negative reviews of other people in this site (why, God, did I not read them before watching this?) and I feel almost everything has been pointed out: bad acting, bad CGI, plain characters, absurd narrative resources... <br/><br/>I feel, however, that many critics have missed an extra negative point which for me was vital: the ridiculous depiction of France, which can not only be ascribed to ignorance but to exaggerated characterization of the American idea of french people not at some point in history, just in ""some past time"": a castle in the middle of nowhere filled with baroque, wig-wearing, overly made-up aristocrats, combined with middle-age plague masks and, especially annoyingly, African- American characters completely integrated in this epoque-less society. I understand Disney intent and praise them for it, but an African-American priest is just so historically inaccurate that I could never really get into the story and forget I was watching a movie from outside. For someone a little familiar with European history, this characterization was forced, artificial, excessive, totally unnecessary for the plot, and overall a constant reminder of how terrible this movie was.<br/><br/>A piece of advice: better watching the animated masterpiece of 1991 (again) than losing your time with this movie."
"arthur_nonimus","10","44","92","25 March 2017"," Don't believe the haters - will go on to become one of the greats
","Whatever you do, under no circumstances, believe the haters. I have read a few reviews so far and most are, sad to say, woefully and shamefully inadequate. <br/><br/>As most would know this is a remake of the 1991 Aminated classic. Winner of Academy Awards and loved by generations, the animated musical casts a long shadow. Any movie following in its footsteps has a lot to live up to. Fortunately, the remake does this in spades.<br/><br/>Beauty and the Beast (La Belle et la Bête in the original french) was a fairy tale published 1740 for the french court. Fairy tales were popular in the French salons at the time. This version - a political thriller of sorts - was later republished in 1756 by Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont for children in the form that is known today. This fairy tale, of the daughter of a merchant who is forced to move to the country after her father loses their fortune, was not the version told in the 1991 animated movie. <br/><br/>To be clear, Disney did not re-invent BatB, but the story was streamlined with elements removed and added to make the transition to the silver screen. The inclusion of Gaston, who doesn't appear anywhere in either of the french versions, is an example of this streamlining. Another is the rose, a pivotal part of the fairy tale, was changed into a plot device. <br/><br/>The problem with any streamlining is that sometimes elements are left out that turn out to be needed to fill plot holes. A plot hole from 1991 - why was the beast ""spoilt"" and ""cruel"" before the curse? Who knows. Another one - Why are Maurice and Belle so different to the town folk? Don't know. Or try this one - why did the Beast lock Maurice up? Because ..... Yeah. It only took 26 years for a remake to come along, and more importantly, a remake which fills the plot holes. And not only fills them but fills them either with new story or even more importantly with elements from the original fairy tale!<br/><br/>Moreover, charges have been levelled against the movie of being a shameless knockoff of the 1991 movie. To this, I have but one word to say - MUSIC. To remake Beauty and the Beast without the songs that earned its place in the hearts of an entire generation would be no less than a crime. The story into which those songs fit, how much can it be changed without the songs becoming irrelevant, or worse yet, out of place? The answer - very little! This charge usually comes with the accusation that certain scenes had been all but duplicated. What those making such a charge fail to realise is that these scenes like the music have become iconographic and inalienable to the Disney story. To lose them would have created a gaping void in the finished product just as changing or removing the songs would have. A symptom of the success of the 1991 movie is that parts must be used in any remake if it is to feel finished to the many, many who have grown up with the original.<br/><br/>Other complaints from reviewers who have panned Beaty and the Beast 2017, unfortunately, get worse, more insignificant and more nit- picky, from there. Unfortunately again it is a symptom of the success of the original that there are so many ready to tear apart this remake by sifting through the minutia to find a flaw.<br/><br/>The remake of Beauty and the Beast took 26 years to come along and was well worth the wait. It is the must see movie of 2017 and many years to come."

I was originally skeptical of seeing it, due to the nature of remakes and them not being as wonderful as the original, but this movie surprised me. Not only did the movie blow my mind, the characters were all well cast and the attention of detail really made this movie 100 times better. This movie was so marvelous, I fail to see how any movie could ever compare to this. If you have not seen the original, this movie will far outshine the timeless classic it is made from.

","To be honest, I don't know what everyone is complaining about. I thought this was a fantastic live rendition of this classic of a movie.<br/><br/>The sets were absolutely beautiful & detailed. The music was enchanting while keeping the original score just as gorgeous as it was. They changed just enough to make it a bit more modern but still kept it the same, something I greatly appreciated.<br/><br/>The acting was on point for me. I thought they did just a fine job. No overacting, keeping to the way the characters were in the original. Emma & Dans chemistry was perfect. Keep in mind they are meant to hate each other at the start THEN fall in love. Which I thought they portrayed perfectly. Still wary of each other, but still that connection.<br/><br/>The costumes were beautiful. Perfect for the era but not over the top when it didn't need to be. And pretty spot on to the original. I was disappointed with Belles iconic ball gown dress, but also it's a movie & I didn't let that one detail bother me. It was about their story, not what they wore.<br/><br/>The musical scores were fantastic just to sum it up in one word. They were entertaining, classy and just plain fun. I wanted to get up and dance & start singing along.<br/><br/>I have NO idea what people are talking about with the 'distraction' of Beasts CGI. I mean. What? And also with the 'creepy' faces of the staff. They kept their faces to the original also. Some had the parts to make faces whiles others didn't and some have to have painted ones. If people get 'creeped out' or distracted' by this stuff then I don't know how they watch most movies now a days & need to rethink their priorities a bit to be honest.<br/><br/>I especially loved the backstory they included for Belles mother. It added a bit more depth to both Belle & her father Maurice, and a bit more believability to Belle & Beasts relationship, due to how it was found.<br/><br/>Beasts origin story was better also. It made his change a lot more satisfying and you could see exactly just how much he changes; not for just himself but for others that he loves.<br/><br/>Also, that whole 'Stockholm syndrome' crap doesn't make its way into this movie. I didn't think it did in the first one to be honest.<br/><br/>In the end I loved this movie. It was a bright, fun movie. You just need to sit down, relax, stop thinking so hard & just enjoy. As that what movies are for. To stop over-analyzing things for just a moment & enjoy something. And this one I easily did."

She looks like a robot in the movie. She did not generate emotions, even taking the most important role of that beautiful novel. The film was rescued for the excellent performance of Luke Evans (Gaston) and Josh Gad (LeFou). The rest of the cast only served as fill in the plot."
"Searsino","4","31","63","18 March 2017"," A Mediocre Live Action Remake of a Disney Classic
","I will be the first person to acknowledge that remakes often can be a necessary part of this industry. But this entire project just didn't sit well with me from the get-go. So let's dive in, shall we?<br/><br/>1) VOCALS:<br/><br/>This was a musical, and as such being the case, it is inexcusable to have Watson as the lead for such a classic. She never had vocal coaching, and from the trailers alone this was clearly going to be CPU corrected throughout to compensate.<br/><br/>As predicted, her voice has been largely manipulated in post. And considering that Walt Disney himself made such a big deal out of the musical production in all of his movies, I cannot understand the complete and total neglect of the soundtrack (again, something largely responsible for what made the original so magical).<br/><br/>2) CGI:<br/><br/>Take a moment and go look at some pictures of CGI work in Life of Pi. Then compare this to Beast's face or any other animation in this remake. I would then like you to ask yourself the following:<br/><br/>How could it be that Life of Pi managed to create imagery of far greater quality on a budget which was $40 million LESS than that which Disney was working with.<br/><br/>3) PRODUCTION & SET DESIGN:<br/><br/>I liken this aspect to someone making everything out of cardboard and then painting it in solid colors so as to exactly match the original. Again, I do not understand why the set looked so lifeless considering Disney has opted for a live-action remake. I couldn't help but feel this was lacking any form of originality with which to carry the movie.<br/><br/>4) CASTING:<br/><br/>Lucy Bevan was the casting director for this one. Some of her more noteworthy credits include The Golden Compass, An Education, Nanny McPhee Returns, Maleficent, 300, and Cinderella. It is quite clear after taking a good look at her directorial resume just how hit-or-miss this person is when it comes to choosing the right people for the right roles.<br/><br/>And once again, with such a strong backing for this film, I find myself left dumbfounded wondering why Disney would take such a gamble with arguably the greatest story to ever come out of the magic factory.<br/><br/>ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS:<br/><br/>This entire project just feels like it was overseen by an entirely new group of execs and with no other intent other than the money. I wouldn't be so harsh, but this is Disney. An organization which prides itself on utilizing fantastic music, strong performances, astounding visuals, and detailed CGI. Yet every single one of those pillars has been overlooked.<br/><br/>I have no inherent problems with Watson. She has proved capable in one of my favorites: The Perks of Being a Wallflower (2012). However, this role was not for her. This is one time where taking the risk (aka learning to sing for the part) was a mistake. A task far too great for her to overcome.<br/><br/>If you are in your early teens, have young children, or are an avid fan of Harry Potter, then this Disney remake is for you. The excitement of seeing familiar characters on screen in real life will be excitement enough, bringing about a sense of nostalgia long sought after.<br/><br/>Simply put, this isn't how films were meant to be created. Shame on you Disney. It's not OK for a company of such proportions to ignore standards spanning nearly a century, instead demonstrating such blatant disregard for the original.<br/><br/>I give this 4 stars. There was nothing special about it. The problem was that Disney chose to reboot a film which was already an 8/10 and failed to bring about any hint of originality.<br/><br/>Looking ahead, I really hope you don't ruin Mulan and The Little Mermaid with similar mistakes. We are currently 0/1. I will remain optimistic, however, given the success of Cinderella. But for the love of all that is good, Disney! PLEASE pull it together in upcoming endeavors.<br/><br/>A FINAL NOTE:<br/><br/>For too long I have seen disingenuous reviews scattered throughout in the opening weeks of any larger budget film release. This is really starting to bother me IMDb! You guys should be able to create some sort of list or set of requirements that must be fulfilled in order to leave a review: for example, requiring users to have rated at least 500+ films, contributing to at least 3 different parts of this community, or even just ensuring the account has no suspicious activity which would be indicative of illegitimate, over the top reviews.<br/><br/>There are of course going to be opposing views out there, however I challenge those suspicious of unwarranted criticism like what I have offered here to go and inspect the profiles to see which ratings are associated with long-time active members. For this movie alone, nearly half of all ratings over 8/10 come from accounts which were made just weeks ago and whose activity consists of but one single rating for the film. These falsified reviews are taking away from the validity of overall IMDb ratings!<br/><br/>Please, please, PLEASE do something about this :(<br/><br/>----- 4/10 STARS -------- Review by Searsino -----"
"trevor-82944","4","34","72","17 March 2017"," Some Improvements Are Not Worth Making
","It's been a tale as old as time, a song as old as rhyme Beauty and the Beast. It was one of the animated instant classics to trigger the Disney Renaissance of the 1990s, defined an entire generation of Disney fans, set off some of the most iconic songs ever to grace the screen, was honored in several lists by the American Film Institute, was preserved in the National Film Registry the second year it was eligible (which is a huge deal), and was the first animated film in history to receive an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture. ​ So no pressure or anything in remaking it, right?<br/><br/>Many of us were worried that this remake would just be a line-for- line remake of the original, but thankfully it's not. Several updates to the story are actually a strong improvement to fill in the problems with the original. The whole village's memory of the castle is erased by the enchantress, a contrast made much more blaring by a cursed eternal winter in the castle's borders even while summer goes on in the village.<br/><br/>Belle's father Maurice also has a more complex subplot that actively engages both Gaston and LeFou, and he is motivated by his collection of homemade paintings and inventions used to memorialize his family legacy. This includes a backstory on Belle's mother, even if it adds virtually nothing to the plot.<br/><br/>Other minor details are added to motivate Belle further, such as teaching a younger village girl to read, only to be condemned by others in the village. The parents will also enjoy this little detail: Gaston is a former war hero, which gives his musical number a whole new flavor. They also would find this new take on the Beast somewhat compelling: he doesn't even try to treat Belle decently as she first comes into the castle. He just keeps her in the prison, only to be moved into an appropriate bedroom without his consent or knowledge.<br/><br/>There are plenty of other small plot holes from the original that are explained here, as the characters make it blatantly clear. What I mean is, it is done like this: one character asks a question we all asked about the original, then another character simply answers the question. Then the plot moves on as if nothing happened. So no high-class writing to be found here.<br/><br/>Although when taking the whole sum of the product into consideration, the elements that remain the same compared to the original fall way, way short. The director of this live action adaptation, Bill Condon, who directed Dreamgirls and wrote the screenplay for Chicago, would presumably know all about how to do a musical properly. Although his skill is screaming to get out this time around, as nothing commands our sorrow for his reimagining of the beloved characters. With the exception of ""Be Our Guest,"" none of the musical numbers or recreated scenes match the energy or creativity of its animated counterpart. I'm not just referring to the fact that most to everyone's singing voices are hard on the ears, but mainly to the fact that everything is rushed, especially the scene in the West Wing.<br/><br/>If you think that you would feel charmed and nostalgic while watching this, sorry—not happening. Maybe it works as a plot expansion of a previously established story, but as a standalone you couldn't help but see the flaws. Belle even looks at the Beast more like she's scowling than like she's captivated by him. Then with Gaston, he doesn't feel like a jerk at all, as in his first meeting with Belle, he doesn't chuck her book into the mud- but actually hands her flowers! Flowers! From the guy we're supposed to hate! It's little details like this that will halt any true joy or tears. But what else would you expect when a remake is produced by a studio that cares more about social correctness than casting actual French actors for a film set in France?<br/><br/>Speaking of which, you may all be wondering at this point, ""what about the exclusively gay moment with LeFou? Should I worry about it harming my kids?"" Well, I can tell you this: You have absolutely nothing to worry about. It's a two second moment at the very end that is just as subtle as it is super easy to toss onto the cutting room floor. In fact, Josh Gad puts in just the right dose of humor and charm in his interpretation of LeFou, and he actually can sing pretty darn well! So you'll end up loving his character by the end, whether or not you agree with the homosexual lifestyle.<br/><br/>Although if you ask me, this remake was never needed to be made. Yes, it did satisfy many of the problems that people have complained about for twenty-five years about the beloved animated classic, but it's not like this predictable fantasy is doing anything new or risky. If anything, it's just going to remind us of how much more moving and charming the original is, and we can sleep easy at night now knowing that some plot holes were filled without the animated film having to explain it for us.<br/><br/>Let's just hope that the live action remake of Aladdin is not a total waste of everything."

","A long time ago in a faraway land, there was a Prince who threw opulent parties. He taxed his kingdom to pay for them and only invited the brightest and most beautiful to attend. During one such party, a poor beggar woman arrived to wait out the storm that raged outside. She offered the Prince a rose in exchange for shelter, but he just laughed in her face. She gave him a second chance, but his heart still wasn't moved. She transformed him into a hideous beast, and the people in the castle who didn't flee in time became trinkets and furniture.<br/><br/>It's a Tale as Old As Time.<br/><br/>In 1991, Disney brought Beauty and the Beast into the world and a classic was born. When Disney announced they were filming a live- action version with Emma Watson in the title role, I was really apprehensive. I'm not a Watson fan, and I have always adored this story, so what was she going to do with one of my favorite princesses? As the months progressed and the rest of the cast came out, I found myself getting excited. Kevin Kline as Maurice? Ewan MacGregor as Lumiere? Ian MacKellan as Cogsworth? Audra MacDonald as Garderobe (the Wardrobe)? Stanley Tucci as Maestro Cadenza? EMMA THOMPSON AS MRS. POTTS?! This was a cast of epic proportions, and I was positive that no matter what I felt for Emma Watson, this film was going to be as good, if not better, than Cinderella in 2014.<br/><br/>And you know what? I was right.<br/><br/>They added a bit more backstory to make the Prince less of a spoiled child, and more of a misled young man. It was in the time before the French Revolution, which makes it historically accurate for him to throw these extravagant parties at the expense of his people, whereas in the cartoon, we only knew the story took place in France in a fairy-tale time period. What I love when films do this is that it makes it feel like magic is available in our own world.<br/><br/>As a longtime Disnerd and Beauty and the Beast music fan, I was extremely concerned with how they'd handle all of the music. Emma Watson has an okay singing voice, and her songs were fine, but when it came to the other characters songs, they completely blew her out of the water.<br/><br/>Ewan MacGregor's take on Be Our Guest was one I waited with bated breath to watch. If you recall in 1991, computer animation was still relatively new, and this was the song they used to create quite the visual treat. Could they do that again in live-action form? They did on Broadway, why not Hollywood? Well, to say they did would be a gross understatement. Plates and food were flying everywhere, there were feather dusters doing synchronized swimming, Belle tried to get a bite of everything they pushed in front of her, and you just got the impression that the showman that was Lumiere had been preparing for this moment his entire life, even before he became a candlestick.<br/><br/>I was a bit surprised that they didn't include the songs Human Again or If I Can't Love Her from the Broadway show, but they did give them new songs which added more characterization. The entire cast had the song, Days in the Sun, where they talked about their former lives and how they felt trapped because of the curse, and the Beast had Evermore where he sang about his former life and how he doesn't think he has a future, especially with his newfound feelings for Belle. The chills were there. It was amazing, and Dan Stevens (Matthew Crawley from Downton Abbey) has got some pipes on him.<br/><br/>I do have to say my favorite transformation throughout the entire film isn't the Beast or any of the staff. It's the unwitting character, LeFou. No, I'm not going to get political. But LeFou is this kid who has admired Gaston and has acted as his best friend for years. He would do anything for Gaston, or so he thinks. We all know Gaston to be a tool of epic proportions, but it's only when his actions become unsavory that LeFou starts to see him for who he truly is. That transition is a beautiful mirror against the transformation of the Beast in the castle. It was my absolute favorite part of the film. It was really, really great.<br/><br/>The only real thing I didn't care for was Emma Watson. I'm just not a fan. I think she's a wooden actress and was when she got into her older Hermione days in Harry Potter. I did like everything they did with Belle, though (she's the inventor now, and invented a washing machine so she could read instead of work. Props, girl!), and she also taught a town girl to read, much to the resentment of the town schoolmaster who didn't want ""another one"" to know how to read. Small minds, I tell you.<br/><br/>Okay, I didn't care for Ariana Grande's half of the Beauty and the Beast duet, either. She's in her twenties now. She should know what consonants are. Use your teeth to sing. Learn from Audra MacDonald, who didn't have nearly enough singing time, despite being half of the castle's entertainment with Stanley Tucci's Maestro Cadenza.<br/><br/>This film is filled with the same amount of fun and warmth and beauty as its predecessor, and then even more. It was well worth it to see it in theaters, and now that it's available on DVD and Blu- Ray, I'll be getting a copy to watch again and again. Please see this movie. Enjoy the magic, and mystery that the cast brought to a timeless tale."

","Superbly entertaining live action remake of an animated Disney classic. Best live-action Disney remake to date. Great CGI special effects, costume design, direction, and cinematography. Standout acting performances by Emma Watson (as the radiant, independent, strong-willed, intelligent, sincere, and charming Belle), Luke Evans (as the profoundly over-the-top, proud, arrogant, and brash Gaston), Ewan McGregor (as the fun, pure joy, light-hearted, and enthusiastic Lumeire), along with solid performances by the rest of the well-chosen and selected ensemble cast members. Although the Prince/Beast could have come off a little less smug and elitist in that ONE scene where he introduces Belle to his large library room in the castle...lol. I preferred the way that similar library introduction scene was better planned, developed, and played out in the animated version. One minor negative in an otherwise amazing and fabulous movie.<br/><br/>Seeing the ""Be Out Guest"" musical scene in the large dining room table when they are serving Belle dinner was flat-out amazing. There was such a pure enthusiasm and detail in that production, they were able to match the memorable musical scene in the animated version. Astonishingly well-done!"

"Sienne","8","6","9","16 June 2017"," Surprising
","Other than the fact that Lumière's French accent was anything but French, this movie was surprisingly engaging. I am well beyond the age of believing in magical spells and fairy dust, and I'm not a huge Disney fan. (At least not Disney movies.) However, I actually found myself emotionally invested in the outcome of the story line -- even though I already knew it! -- and rooting for the underdog. Emma Watson's voice rang true and clear, albeit in Disney style, and Luke Evans was a perfect Gaston. The money that I paid to rent this was well spent; if I had paid the full price of a movie ticket, I would not have regretted it."

"CraigsCritique","6","6","9","1 May 2017"," Live Action Disney Adaptations - Nostalgia Run Amok?
","The question is exactly what do we expect from these Disney live action remakes of classic animated films? Only you as a viewer or original fan can fully answer that question.<br/><br/>I will however at least from my point of view attempt to gain a perspective given that we've been presented with three straight remakes, Cinderella, The Jungle Book and in this instance Beauty and the Beast.<br/><br/>With each of these instances there's arguments to be had in relation to whether the original is an absolute classic, whether the film has enough material to flesh out an extended live action feature or even whether just on principal remaking Beauty and the Beast, a film that's universally adored by critics and audiences alike whether this's even a project that should be attempted.<br/><br/>Lets focus on a couple of these aspects, I'll admit that I had intermittingly seen parts of the 1991 animated feature and was very familiar with the songs but had never watched the film from beginning to end until literally two weeks before seeing this years live action adaptation so on one hand I don't have the baggage of twenty years or more of preconceptions for what the film should do in its live action guise, however seeing both the film versions within the space of two weeks does come with the advantage (or maybe baggage) of being able to see things in a more mirrored perspective which with this film in particular was a fascinating thing to behold.<br/><br/>On the point I've just made I'm going to go down the road of them recreating those scene moments with an accuracy which to many a fan I'm sure was pure delight to simply see an exact mirrored scene only with a live action cast, the opening Belle musical sequence is the quintessential example of this with every aspect pretty much identically replicated to a precision that I've not quite seen on this large scale, yes we saw similar things like it in their Cinderella adaptation a couple years ago but that film was so short with plenty of potential to improve and to mould into something that isn't exactly a clone of it's animated counterpart, however I would say that it didn't completely work for Cinderella and also in respect to The Jungle Book Jon Favreau it would appear did want to go beyond what the Disney animated feature did and made it certainly a more cinematic experience type of film that although yes had nods to said animated film but did have ambitions beyond those Disney constraints.<br/><br/>To carry on that point I will simply go onto what I deem to be the films greatest strength and unsurprisingly it is the musical sequences of which the film lives and breaths off of, the question then becomes what exactly are we enjoying about these sequences because haven't we already seen and heard them? Yes and no is my unsurprising conclusion to this question, to focus on two songs in particular 'Gaston' and 'Be Our Guest' these are impeccably entertaining songs in their own right so why did these work even better in this format? I suppose it's down to the physical theatrical performance involved in recreating them, specifically Gaston as so much of the song is for a comedic effect that is only amplified with the performance song and dance piece that it is, in respect to Be Our Guest the visual treat that the animated film created again here is amplified to a splendiferous visual treat that only a creative more physical form can lend to the sequence.<br/><br/>What also must be said is that when talking about this more theatrical performance and the positives it brings it's also hugely reliant upon the individual actors involved and with Gaston in particular Josh Gad, Luke Evans and that whole ensemble are what gives that sequence the strength it has, also the vocal performances of the Be Our Guest voice cast is impeccable, equally when we're talking about the opening Belle sequence the same rule is applied, yes the song is adequately performed by Emma Watson, but it's hard when clearly we've heard this song performed by a more than superior singer and given that the opening is most certainly a scene for scene recreation of the animated feature the startling contrast of such qualities are much more keenly and therefore negatively noted by the viewer.<br/><br/>I'm clearly going into many specifics that a normal reviewer would not do but I'm trying to find out exactly what it is about these remakes that we clearly flock to see as an audience, as this is part of a more broader film debate given in other areas of the film world we've experienced films like Jurassic World and Star Wars: The Force Awakens, films that overly rely on the audiences nostalgia for the past film products in order to positively survive, yes that's an extremely harsh statement to make but given that Beauty and the Beast regularly just recreates exact scenes from the past film the point I'm trying to explore is exactly at what point does a remake or nostalgia kill or make a film that is in front of you.<br/><br/>In respect to this years Beauty and the Beast adaptation, my overall reaction was one of differing feelings, there were the joys of those particular musical moments being recreated, but equally I was unsure what exactly the film generally was bringing to the table as a project, the film does add some scenes to the fray for further context for main characters and there was two extra songs, however I particularly thought that although they did the film no harm I didn't think 'oh isn't it really good they've included that' So overall an inconclusive reaction from me and I'm going to continue to have this debate with myself but I do believe that a more capable group of film reviewers/writers might be able to more articulate an argument."
"sara2520","7","6","9","20 March 2017"," Eh?
","If you saw the animated version, then you have seen this movie. It's the same as the animated movie only live action. There was absolutely no reason for this movie to be made besides as an easy cash cow for Disney cashing in on the nostalgia of fans of the original. This movie brings nothing extra to the table.It took no chances and pandered to feminists and LGBT members when it wasn't necessary. There was no need to make a big deal of the blink and you miss it gay scene. There was also no need to make Gaston's sidekick gay or in love with Gaston. As far as the ballroom scene, it wasn't as mesmerizing as the original. I'm not a fan of Beauty and the Beauty. It's not my favorite Disney movie, but I must admit the ballroom scene was a masterpiece by itself and the best part of the original. I think the movie should have taken a chance and used the concept of the moral of the story and use it in a new twist like the numerous adaptions of the Cinderella movies do from the cheesier ones to the better ones like Ever After or Ella Enchanted.I checked it out. I loved the ending especially the clock's reaction, which caused me to actually laugh. I really wish they did not CGI Dan Stevens' Beast. So it wasn't a bad movie, but you can't mess with perfection. Love or hate it, the original was a masterpiece and this one does not compare."

","After reading so many 1/10, I feel compelled to write a review. It's not the greatest ever film but it's a good one, much better than many of the CGI films out there. This is a fantastic update to a classic. The great actors (Ewan McGregor, Emma Thompson, and Ian McKellen) lend their voices to the inanimate objects and as a result, they are very moving; I teared. Luke Evans is a bad guy who is really good to hate. Even the Belle here has agency and strength to stand up to brutes. She's a good role model to little girls who watch the show."

","First of all, this is probably the Disney's movie that influenced me the less since I didn't watch Beauty and the Beast 100x times when I was a kid. Instead, I spent that time with the awesome The Lion King, which is also getting a live-action remake. Basically, my opinion will not have many comparisons with the original 1991 movie simply because I can't really remember the film that well.<br/><br/>So, what did I think about this one? Well, while it didn't amaze or surprised me like The Jungle Book did, it's still a great movie. The story is definitely darker and scarier than the original, which I did enjoy a lot. The small changes to the screenplay work just fine and actually add something that the original didn't have (mainly because it was an animated movie mostly created just for kids), as well as all of the characters.<br/><br/>The casting is pitch-perfect: Emma Watson is the only actress that I can see portraying Belle the way she did. Really, really brilliant. Luke Evans (Gaston) also has a great performance and Josh Gad portrayed well a different Le Fou (if you've seen the news, you know what I'm talking about ... Some theaters even refused to show the movie due to this character's new personality). The friendship between Lumiere (Ewan McGregor) and Cogsworth (Ian McKellen) gives the best comedy moments of the entire film and that was hilarious to watch.<br/><br/>As for the score, there were a lot of questions as soon as the movie got a release date: what songs will they keep? Which ones are they going to cut? Are they going to change or add something new? Well, the original songs are great as they always were, but the new ones ... It didn't work. The movie has more than a two-hour runtime and Bill Condon wasn't able to balance everything. The time between the dialogue and singing scenes was too short, which started to annoy me: ""Really? Another song? They just sang for ten minutes, like two minutes ago ..."". This affected the pacing a lot and there were a lot of moments where I was just off. Completely lost.<br/><br/>Also, the movie starts by telling us the Beast's past (literally narrating it to the audience), as the action goes without any dialogue. Bad choice, it's a huge exposition scene that could have been told way better and when I realized that they wasted most of the time with too much singing, I am now sure that the film would be a lot more captivating than it was.<br/><br/>Beauty and the Beast continues the excellent work Disney is doing with the live-action remakes and I'm now sure that if The Lion King really hits the screens again ... Well, who knows if an Oscar is right behind the corner. This remake is beautifully crafted and has a perfectly amazing cast, with a great dark touch to the original movie's screenplay. However, it's far from perfect: too much singing and the time between song and dialogue is too short, which negatively influences its pacing and interest. Also, the Beast's past is badly explored and an opportunity to get the audience more attached to the characters is wasted.<br/><br/><ul><li>MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)</li></ul>"
"Sewaat","8","7","11","10 June 2017"," Essentially, a perfect remake
","When this film was first announced, skepticism was of course running rampant. The original animated film from 1991 is widely considered a masterpiece and one of Disney's best films. Doing the story justice with real actors of flesh and blood was going to be a challenge. That was no secret. So how does the finished film compare to the original? Thankfully, I found Bill Condon's take on the ""tale as old as time"" to be surprisingly refreshing. It's a great new spin on a story we're all familiar with. But by taking elements from the original that worked well the first time and changing what did not, this adaptation of Beauty and the Beast is easily what I consider to be the most successful Disney remake we've seen yet.<br/><br/>For the most part, the film takes the setting of it's story very seriously. Costumes and sets are all tailored and designed to perfection. And similar to Cinderella (2015), the film feels more like a period piece then a live action spin on a cartoon. The production design team were clearly trying very hard to make you believe that this is 1770's France and I think they definitely succeeded. There is some great craftsmanship at work here. This might seem like only a minor aspect of the overall spectacle, but Disney has run into some trouble before in terms of accurately representing history. Needless to say, that was scarcely a problem in this film. <br/><br/>One of the most prevalent things about this film I can say for it is that it has one of the most superb casts I've seen in a long while. Say what you will about Emma Watson's singing abilities, but she certainly looks the part of Belle, if nothing else. She is beautiful, intelligent and strong. Everything that we loved about Belle in the original translates nicely to this version. But the actor who deserves the most of my praise is Luke Evans as Gaston. Right from the moment he was announced, I knew he would be nothing but phenomenal in the role. And I was happily correct. Evans brings a fierce intensity to the character that was not present in the original. Gaston, it seems was a part that he was born to play.<br/><br/>Other noticeable performances include Josh Gad as Gaston's meek side kick, Lefou; a side villain who is greatly improved upon in this version; and Kevin Kline as Belle's father, Maurice. He brings a quiet and sincere quality to the character, contrasting greatly with his over-the-top persona in the original. Dan Stevens is also quite excellent as the cursed Prince. Having no prior knowledge of the actor's previous works, I was nervous to see how he would deal with playing such a complex character. Thankfully my worries were put to rest over the course of the film. He exudes a lot of humanity and charm through layers of CGI and has a strong singing voice to boot.<br/><br/>In my humble opinion, Beauty and the Beast is a nearly perfect remake. It changes what didn't work before and keeps what did. It adds new songs which are as equally powerful as the old classics we know. The care, love and attention to detail is hugely apparent in every scene. It is a well crafted and high spirited effort to bring a beloved animated feature to life. <br/><br/>Now that the next string of Disney remakes have been revealed, we may soon experience a new and prosperous period for the company, one with more momentum and success than the Disney Renaissance. But for now, let Beauty and the Beast serve as the example for how to make a proper and successful remake that doesn't lose any of the heart of it's predecessor. It's a charming, emotional and passionate story that will always be adored for all time."

","This is my first ever review and I only took the time, because I had been so disappointed by what I had seen, I thought I'd share my experience. I took my partner and daughter to see this film as they are both great fans of all things Disney, and I have seen the original animated B&TB film myself many times before, and I had always enjoyed it. When I came to see this, I had great expectations and paid good money to watch it in IMAX 3D. What a terrible film! What has Disney done! The entire CGI was rubbish, lifeless, and completely underwhelming. Acting, especially by Emma Watson as Belle was dull and uninspiring. Kevin Kline as Maurice was boring and unbelievable as Belle's father. Beast was non committal as erm... Beast. All the other famous names were also wasted on this film. Only Luke Evans's character as Gaston stood out amongst the whole lot. All in all, not a must see film but If you really must see this film, then don't waste your money like me on expensive tickets, and wait for it to come out on Sky Box Office in a couple of Months, and so for under a fiver, you too can be underwhelmed!"
"bfsr81","4","16","31","10 April 2017"," Disappointing
","I watched the original in early 90s , I watch it now again very often with my 3 years daughter and enjoyed it again. The old version is almost perfect and probably one of the best Animation movies ever made, one of the best musicals and one of the best Disney movies. I went with my daughter (who loves the original) to see this again and what did we find ?!! A real disappointment !!! My daughter who watches and enjoys the original at least once a week fall asleep after 1 hour. I felt a headache of the unnecessary, unexpressive, low quality, excessive CGI effects and My wife almost cried because of the horror done with this classic.<br/><br/>The movie has only 1 positive, which is adding the rose robbery scene as that's the real story in the traditional folk story. I can also say that Luke Evans doesn't look like Gaston but does well, Mc gregor , Ian and Thompson do good acting when allowed. But otherwise, the movie was very disappointing due to the following:<br/><br/> Emma Watson acting is fake and has nothing to do with Belle. She doesn't look smart, she is not feminine, she is rude with Gaston, she looks like a kid etc. <br/><br/> The beast has no expressions, it is not scary and is not tender  it is nothing.<br/><br/> New songs are below the originals. So, why did we insert them?<br/><br/> Actors are not able to sing and do not improve the old songs.<br/><br/> The original had a lot of funny scenes for kids and adults. This one has none unless throwing a big snow ball or putting make up on a beast is considered funny !!!<br/><br/> Lumiere, Mrs pott, cogsworth, chip etc. are not funny anymore, have no expressions and cause headache when watching. While they were Essential in the original movie.<br/><br/> The castle, the village etc. all seem very fake for unknown reason as they neither look like the original movie nor like real. So, why didn't we just shoot the movie in any village in the Alpes or Pyrinees instead ?!!!!!<br/><br/> I am not racist, But the colored Librarian what is doing in France when the movie is supposed to take place? And what about the library? only 6 books ?!!! Then what did Belle read ?! always the same 6 books ?!!!! <br/><br/> What did the homosexual content add to the story? Are we promoting it or defending it ?!! or is it supposed to be funny ?!!! I don't understand it.<br/><br/> What is the Paris thing about ?!! What did it add? My daughter got asleep at that point !!!<br/><br/> How come the tree stroke by the thunder disappear ?! How does it snow in June ?! How does it snow constantly in very limited terrain? Is this movie supposed to be more serious than the original with real actors or more childish or what?!! I don't get it.<br/><br/> What is Maurice ? how come he sits in a table and starts eating without being invited !! why ?!!! <br/><br/> Adult humor is missing: Lumiere – Don Juan Scenes, Gaston – Macho scenes, Belle promoting Aladdin etc.<br/><br/>The movie is a failure, if you remake an excellent movie like this you should have at least considered adding: excellent acting, new funny scenes, improved songs, new better songs, dancing, choreography  etc. but the movie didn't.<br/><br/>So, IN conclusion, this version is a very bad experience not worth its budget or publicity. I have to watch the animation one with my daughter almost every month because she adores it because the movie deserves that. I am sure that with this version I will not face this problem."
"jojojojocool","4","16","31","26 March 2017"," Monotony and the Bleak
","This film could have been brilliant. I know that Disney's live-action remakes can be great. I loved Disney's 2014 Maleficent and the 2015 Cinderella remake. However I hated Disney's 2016 remake of The Jungle Book (an absolute classic ruined!). Anyway, Beauty and the Beast... I really thought I was going to love this film. This film feels so flat in comparison to Maleficent and Cinderella. It relies heavily on CGI (note to Bill Condon - you can chuck in as many special effects as you like - but if your script is awful and the characters are dull then there's no point at all). It starts with a prince being cursed because he's too into his looks and not charitable enough (how Gaston gets away with not being cursed by Agathe later on in the film as well I do not understand - seeing as he also judges her by her appearance just like the prince did). Next is Belle (Emma Watson under a heap of auto tuning equipment basically) singing ""Little Town"". It felt so unnatural and forced and was actually quite awkward to watch. That's when I started to think ""hmm I don't think this is going to live up to expectation"". The script is bad throughout. When Gaston is trying to win over Belle in the beginning it's actually such uncomfortable viewing. The lines of dialogue don't flow naturally between the actors at all. Does Emma Watson think that Belle is a feminist icon (as she has stated so much since being cast in this film) simply because she turns down Gaston?? Is that it?! Because there really doesn't seem to be anything feminist about Belle whatsoever as far as I can understand. Oh, she can read. Um so I guess therefore she's a feminist. Right... Over to the beast's castle then (are we expected to believe that the townspeople had never noticed this huge run-down castle covered in snow and ice, which apparently only takes a quick horse ride to get to??) and the weird half CGI / half human beast has imprisoned Belle's dad. Belle goes to rescue her dad (played by Kevin Kline who delivers a forgettable performance - but who can blame him with such a dull script to work with). Belle changes places with her dad and is now the prisoner instead of him. I really do not understand why so few of the characters speak in a French accent. The film is set in France and yet nearly all the characters have British accents. Why would you make the effort to have SOME characters speak in a French accent, but not ALL the characters?! That doesn't make sense. The song sequences feel rushed (Be Our Guest - what was that??!! A CGI mess!!). I didn't like Belle's yellow dress. It reminded me of a dress that Drisella or Anastasia would wear in Cinderella. The ruffles on each side looked awful and the ""Tale as old as time"" ballroom sequence was nowhere near special or magical enough. It was actually a bit dull. There was no heart and no chemistry between Belle and Beast. Belle and Beast have a rushed couple of scenes where they ""fall in love"" apparently - again without any chemistry between them jumping off the screen. There's a really weird scene where Belle and Beast teleport to Paris circa the year that Belle's mother died. But it really doesn't have much significance or poignance (maybe by that point I just didn't care about the story or the characters anymore - as it was getting so boring!). Actually thinking about it, this should have been an amazing moment full of emotion and significance but once it again it felt pointless, rushed, and flat. The townspeople eventually find out about the Beast and Gaston leads all the awful townspeople (who annoyingly never get any kind of comeuppance for being so hateful and vulgar) to the castle to kill the beast. I was hoping the librarian might jump in and surprise us all by being a hero as he didn't really join in on the cheering when everyone was gearing up to follow Gaston. But nope, no twists or interest like that were permitted. Gaston and Beast fight it out until Gaston falls to his death. Belle and Beast don't profess their love for each other in time before the last rose petal falls so the animated household items turn back into inanimate objects and Beast will stay a Beast forever. Right?? That's what we're led to believe the whole film. Wrong. It's all OK because it turns out Agathe can just magic the rose back together whenever she feels like it - so actually the Beast always had as long as he needed to fall in love and the rose timer - as it turns out- was irrelevant. I hated the ending where everyone is just dancing exactly like in the very opening scene of the film. Basically there should be a voice-over in the end after all that saying ""nothing changed and no one learned anything and the castle went back to doing nothing but throwing parties again and everyone was still very much focused on only looks."" ... Belle fell in love with a Beast but thank goodness he's not really a Beast he's actually a handsome prince! Phew!! What kind of message is that???? What was the point of this film?? What were the messages?? I didn't get it. The characters, the acting, the singing, the script, the storyline all fell completely flat. No heart and no soul. Disney - please don't keep creating remakes for the sake of it! If it's not going to be better than the original then please don't bother. I'm worried because I've heard that remakes of The Lion King and Aladdin are on their way to being produced. Oh great more auto tuning and CGI overload..."

","A huge disappointment.<br/><br/>The only thing great about this film is probably the animation of the supporting characters (ie. The candle / clocks, etc). Well done in that area.<br/><br/>However, Producers made a huge mistake in casting Emma Watson as Belle. With her usual 'too knowing' look and accent, watching the film is like watching the Harry Potter star making a parody appearance. The strong English Accent is cringey throughout the film and Emma clearly is not a believable Belle. One of the original Belle's main features are her big luscious eyes batting gracefully and innocently. Whether the Producers are looking for a modern Belle or not, the casting failed miserably. <br/><br/>With all the hype, I was truly hoping for a ""a movie that you must watch at least once in your lifetime"" quality and vibe. There was clearly none here and it was as if the producers are given a big budget due to their status, but rushed on the set up without applying a masterpiece-making creative direction, completing the film on a whim, throwing in a couple of big names and making do with clear super imposed backgrounds. The opening scenes with Belle was as if it was all filmed in a small studio section with no air. Those who find her accent refreshing as Belle are just pulling the strings back to something favourable in their imagination and to settle with acceptance.<br/><br/>With the plot and characters already well known and predictable, they should have captured other aspects of making it a big modern classic - such as going 'outstanding' on vocals and emotional pulls. There was no effort here and the main characters are heavily set on auto tune and heavily lacking of real emotions.<br/><br/>The film is worth watching if you're curious, and it will be sufficient to please the kids who tend to enjoy a subtle entertaining objective expressions in a simple plot, but with the potential it had from the start, the film makers failed to go the mile. <br/><br/>A true waste."
"nvmanatee323","4","16","31","19 March 2017"," Beauty and The Beast...what is lost cannot be found.
","To kick things off, let me say I've been a Disney fan since the beginning. Beauty and the Beast, the original animated version, was leaps and bounds more enjoyable. This version removes the soul of the story. Disney didn't seem to want to be bothered by what would actually be enjoyable to watch, or more, what would be important to keep you engaged. Emma Watson simply was a poor representation of Belle. She tried, I'll give her that, but it would've looked more natural seeing the strings the director tied Watson's appendages to make her move about the scenes. <br/><br/>Beyond Watson's contribution to the film, the Beast was just plain bad design. Disney has been pushing out films for decades, but can't get the CGI remotely on par with today's standards? Luke Williams provided a great representation of Gaston however, so the film has that going for it. Pointing out the topic which received the most controversy, the forcefully presented sexual affiliation of character Lefou was just bad taste on Disney's part. While the banter and side context between Gaston/Lefou was somewhat entertaining, the portrayal of homosexual desire designed by Disney in this Children's film was bad judgment and part of a seemingly larger agenda.<br/><br/>In short, if you are expecting to see a wholesome family film, this isn't it. I've got no problem with homosexual references in adult films, but this is for kids. Disney was previously unbiased and was successful. If this new direction continues, I can say Disney will more than likely lose a good deal of business from a much larger, more value-driven number of communities."

","OK, let's get the gay thing out of the way first: it was horribly forced and awkward.<br/><br/>Remember ""Victor Victoria""? Anyone? For the few that remember what a GOOD movie is like, everyone in that film BELONGED in that film.<br/><br/>The gay character here is present because political correctness and diversity. That's all.<br/><br/>A lesson to all: when you shove something into a decidedly non-political movie for the sake of your ideology even when it should be clear it doesn't fit, you ruin it. This goes for 'Christian' and any other philosophies as well. PAY ATTENTION TO YOUR STORY. Nothing else matters.<br/><br/>As for the rest... it's just... there. Despite being 'live-action' it feels flatter than the 2D animated original. The story goes through the motions and achieves nothing more. I'd rather watch the animated version again.<br/><br/>I fear this is also going to be the case with the retold ""Lion King"" Disney is planning. As with this movie, I feel most people are going to look at these over-expensive CGI effect fests and conclude as I do: other than nostalgia-driven cash grabs, what's the point?"

","I'm not a person who hates remakes and I understand why a lot of studios are making remakes but at the same time, if you are going to remake a movie DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT!<br/><br/>One of the reasons I disliked this remake so much is that it tries a few different things only to end up just copying the original. Are you kidding me?<br/><br/>Granted, the movie is visually stunning. The costumes in this movie are gorgeous save for that godawful prom dress Watson wears during the ball room scene. The scenery is also very lovely to look at and the CGI is decent. The only issue I had with the CGI was Mrs. Potts. She was not charming, she was creepy. Why couldn't they make her look decent? Everything else was fine save for her.<br/><br/>Now if you have daughters who are dying to see this movie, then I could suggest you go see it but that is it. The movie is rather dull. I think that's the major problem. Say what you want about the Cinderella remake but it was fun, colorful and vivid. This remake has no love or light in it. The only actors who seem to give a crap are Josh Gad, Luke Evans and Ewan McGregor. The recent of the cast is trying their damnedest to give decent performances. Like Stanley Tucci is trying and so is Gugu Mbatha-Raw. Heck, even Audura McDonald is trying so hard to have fun with the role she was given. It seems like a struggle for everyone.<br/><br/>But the worst part of this movie is Emma 'I'm a Fake Feminist' Watson.<br/><br/>I don't even know where to begin.<br/><br/>Now I do think Emma was talented in the Harry Potter movies but it suddenly seems like she has forgotten how to act. She shows literally no emotion throughout this whole film. When she discovers that Lumiere is walking and talking, she doesn't look shocked. When the beast gets shot by Gaston, still no emotion! Even when the Beast finally turns into a human, she just has this stupid look on her face! Emma, SHOW SOME GODDAMN EMOTION! YOU'RE AN ACTRESS, IT'S YOUR JOB! And then, she tries to sing. Oh my god, even the auto tuning didn't help! Never have I heard such a flat voice!<br/><br/>I know it sounds like I'm being harsh but this movie had been over hyped since the director got his hands on it and I was just left feeling underwhelmed with this whole thing. Wait for this remake to come on Netflix, don't waste your money."

","OK, so the animated 1991 version is my childhood. Some of my fondest memories ever, is watching the VHS tape with my younger brother. So, maybe I shouldn't have gone to see this remake, but I felt ""I have to, I mean how bad can it be?""<br/><br/>In all fairness, it wasn't horrible. But, if it urges me to write my first review here, it's not good. <br/><br/>First of all, I liked Emma Watson more than I thought I would. The surroundings were very pretty, Luke Evans did a good job as Gaston, some of the new songs were quite nice, but that's about it.<br/><br/>I was really excited about the supporting cast, I mean it's Kevin Kline, Emma Thompson, Ian McKellen etc. But they didn't do much for me. <br/><br/>I appreciate that they wanted to embellish the story and the musical numbers, but they just tried to hard. I didn't like the new arrangements in the music, they changed too much for no reason. <br/><br/>I was underwhelmed by the CGI, I expected more from that hefty budget. <br/><br/>I really disliked the way they did the ending. When the beast is ""dying"" and Belle is by his side, it's the most gripping moment in the original. In this one, we see him and Belle, she is crying, I am tearing up, and then...they CUT AWAY. We all of a sudden see Lumiere and Cogsworth and the rest of the ""household staff"" coming to life, and then they come back to Belle and the beast and she tells him that she loves him. Totally anticlimactic. I lost all emotion, and I just don't understand why they did that.<br/><br/>When the beast is finally himself again, we see them dancing, and all of sudden, in this romantic scene, they feel the need to add a joke. Belle says something like ""How would you feel about growing a beard?"". Totally uncalled for. <br/><br/>The ending was just nowhere near the original in it's emotion, beauty and grandness, and the same goes for the movie as a whole.<br/><br/>Stick with the original, that's all I can say."

"gmacdon-16521","10","29","63","25 March 2017"," Fantastic remake of the original classic
","When I heard that Disney were going to remake Beauty and the Beast, I was a bit sceptical as this is probably one of the most popular Disney films ever made so it was difficult to see how they could live up to the original and yet put a fresh spin on it. However, I am delighted to say that this is a stunning and beautiful remake of the original Disney classic.<br/><br/>The cast was great and Emma Watson did a fantastic job in portraying Belle. What truly amazed though, me was the incredible CGI effects on Belle's village and in particular the castle of the beast, of course not forgetting the beast himself! The new songs they added were really good as well as all the much loved songs from the original. I was really surprised at the singing talent of the cast, particularly Emma Watson and Luke Evans - I never knew either of them could sing so well! I think adding new scenes like when Belle and the Beast travelled back to her original home was good as it helps you to see more of Belle's backstory and what happened to her mother which you did not see as much of in the original. Also, it was good how they filmed the opening sequence of the film where the enchantress comes to the prince's palace, as in the original that was all told through narration and a stained glass window. The comedy elements they added was a nice touch, still keeping the light banter between Cogsworth and LumiÃ¨re.<br/><br/>To be honest I can't see what all the complaints are about. People complained about Maleficent (which I agree was a poor film), saying how it deviated from the original too much. Finally, Disney are sticking to the original and still a ton of complaints. What were they supposed to do? In my opinion this is a brilliant film and if you, like me are a fan of the original then it is a must see film."

"aka-45316","5","2","2","5 February 2019"," Everything about this Film was a 50/50 Every Step of the Way
","The movie was definitely a mix of both good and bad every step of the way. An interesting movie, but, it's nothing compared to the 1991 animated version.<br/><br/>The score and musical numbers orchestrated by returning composer Alan Menken I thought were a definite mix of 50/50. The brand new songs Menken orchestrated, such as ""Evermore"" & ""Days in the Sun"", are the ones that I thought have been pretty well thought out and had a lot of life stored in them, but, the remakes of the old songs such as ""Be Our Guest"" & ""Belle"" felt much on the cringing side and time consumingly slow, especially with the pacing of the music and the way the performers sang them.<br/><br/>Another thing I couldn't help but note was that the way the background sets were made, particularly the castle & village, looked like they were props for a high school play, although, I definitely commend the cinematography for helping everything seem and feel natural.<br/><br/>With the direction, I think Bill Condon did fine, though, unlike his work on Mr. Holmes, I don't think it's one of his best works. Like I already said, the cinematography he gave the film was perfect. However, I felt that the action moments, particularly with the scenes of the wolf attacks, and the villagers vs the castle residents, were too sluggish and less lively, especially compared to the original.<br/><br/>The story and screenplay done by Stephen Chbosky & Evan Spiliotopoulos did also seem too excessively similar to the original, and I didn't think it was as ground-breakingly emotional as the animated version. But, most of all, I didn't think the story did a good job at making itself it's own instead of seeming like some sort of carbon copy. I did think that the most interesting moment came with the book where you could travel anywhere in the world, as well as the backstory about Belle's mother and what happened to her.<br/><br/>When it comes to the cast and their performances, I definitely have mixed opinions on which ones were great and which ones weren't great.<br/><br/>The casting and performances of Emma Watson & Luke Evans as Belle and Gaston were the ones that I felt seemed completely out of place. They definitely looked their parts, but the way they both moved and sounded didn't seem natural, and it looked like that because their characters are so highly renowned, they just weren't able to perform without looking like the pressure of being & living up to those characters was too great.<br/><br/>Also, with the exception of Ewan McGregor as Lumiere, none of the cast made their roles French enough for the town and time period the story takes place in.<br/><br/>The incorporation of African-American cast members and characters also didn't feel right. I'm not being racist or anything, it's just...when you look in your own history books, you'll find that the time people of certain ethnicity, like African-Americans, Spanish, and Asians, did not become prevalently widespread until much later than the time period the movie takes place in. I found that to be an example of being too unnecessarily politically correct, and when used at the wrong time, it gives inaccuracy to the setting and culture of a story.<br/><br/>However, when it comes to casting and performances, not everyone was terrible. As I likely said, Ewan McGregor portrayed Lumiere perfectly, and Kevin Kline...he gave his portrayal and character of Maurice a sense of innocence, tenderness, and warmth, and he took his role on like a pro compared to Watson & Evans.<br/><br/>Josh Gad, who portrays Lefou, was also quite the eye-catcher. Admittedly, his character did have a slight guy crush on Gaston, but really, he's not inherently gay. Even though Gad obviously kept his American accent, he was actually really fun to watch. He had the best comedic-timing out of everyone, and the singing chops he gave for every song he was in were extremely well-done. So, if you're a fan of Josh Gad, I think you should totally see this film.<br/><br/>But the real star of the movie comes from the guy who played the Beast himself: Dan Stevens. The performance & voice he gave the character, as well as the makeup and motion capture used on him, made the Beast so lifelike and alive. Every moment with him on the screen also makes things worthwhile, because he gives off such strength & emotion into the role.<br/><br/>Overall, the film isn't bad, but, it pales to the original."

"rolandjordaan2","4","2","2","14 September 2018"," Beauty and the Beast - Spoiler Free Review
","Beauty and the Beast review - (impossible to spoil for anyone who's seen the original), but this is going to be long as hell, because I have a lot to rant about, so be warned.<br/><br/>It's no great secret that the original Beauty and the Beast is my favourite animated film of all time; I kept the VHS and the DVD is displayed promptly above my desk, along with films like Shawshank Redemption and Mystic River, so I'll admit, even if this remake had been good, it probably would have had a hard time winning me over. So I openly admit my bias. However, as I was sitting in the theater, I kept asking myself the question, would I be enjoying this, even if I hadn't seen the original, and my unfortunate answer was simply - no. So, for now, let's look at this film as a standalone, we put the original out of our minds, and we just look at this as if it's the first adaptation. The first, and most obvious problem, Emma Watson can't sing; I can't emphasize that enough, she can't sing. Sure she holds the notes (most the time) but it's all completely safe and phoned in, kind of like watching Idols and seeing one of those dull performances where the judges feedback comes down to something like, ""your voice is okay, you have no charisma"" and that's not only her singing, that's her whole performance. Belle should have spunk, she should be hard headed but still likable, not fitting into her surrounding, but still accepting of the townsfolk and the simple lives they live - this rendition of Belle is simply Emma Watson playing Emma Watson, and it fails. The only chemistry she has with anyone on screen is Kevin Kline as her father, a character I liked because he completely did his own thing, it's like he never watched the original film, because this is a completely new character and it worked, and he was likable and sympathetic and: ORIGINAL - sorry, I know I said I'm not going to compare immediately to the original, but I have to now - even though Emma Watson is trying to do her own thing, at the same time she is still trying to duplicate the original animated character, but doing it badly, and somehow showing far less emotion than that animated character ever did. And yes, I mentioned emotions, so let's get to one of my biggest gripes with this film, the objects (Cogsworth, Lumiere, Mrs. Potts etc)...you know in Thomas the Tank Engine when the train's mouths don't move and it's really uncomfortable to watch, well picture that, but give them less emotion, and you still won't have a clue how uncomfortable I felt watching these things. Now, don't get me wrong, I get what they were trying to do - the flat faces with the flat eyes, mouths, etc...they're going for a more realistic approach, sacrificing emotion for realism...my question is WHY???? This is freaken Beauty and the Beast, a fairy tale, I think viewers will forgive you if your content doesn't look super realistic, but at least has personality, but no, you decide to base everything on the voice work - and here's the clicker, the voice work isn't all that great either. We have Sir Ian McKellen, a brilliant actor, a voice anyone can identify, and with not even an attempt to change it, it's distracting as hell. Ewan McGregor, the only character who's at least trying to do an Italian accent, but half the time it fails and it's awkward to listen to. I will give some credit to Emma Thompson and Haydn Gwynne, because at least their voices matched the characters and sounded natural, but again, with these deadite looking pieces of furniture - they had nothing to work with. Now I'm going to start making references to the original, and no, in this case - that's not unfair, the songs are the same, the dialogue's the same: this is like Gus Van Sant's remake of Psycho if they had told a feminist to do a slight rewrite of the script, keep it basically identical, but just different enough so that it can look like we tried. First a positive: Luke Evans as Gaston - I liked this version of him, no actually I preferred this version of him, while in the original Gaston was just unlikeable from the get go, here they actually tried giving him some character - and it almost worked. That scene in the market, right in the beginning, in the original Gaston approaches Belle and condescends her immediately, it establishes their relationship and we understand why she finds him repulsive, here - he talks to her gently, he attempts a softer approach, even shows interest in what she likes - and I sat there thinking, why is she being so cruel to him, thus far he's done nothing to deserve it. So you think after she rejects him he's going to walk away upset and mad at her, but no, he talks about her to LeFou and he does so in a respective manner, saying really nice things about her - frankly, at this point in the movie, I was on Gaston's side, he was nicer, more respectful - frankly he could do BETTER than Belle. Even his relationship with LeFou is improved, he actually shows an appreciation for his friend and is generally nice to him, unlike the original where he kinda just comes forth as a bully. So about halfway through the movie, the writers abruptly remember that Gaston is supposed to be the bad guy, so they do a complete 180 with the character and simply turn him back into the original, making me wonder if I'm still watching the same movie. This pissed me off almost more than Belle's character because they actually did have something going with this one. Next, the songs, now there are a few new songs in this film...yay...the problem is I don't recall a single one of them, and never will any of them reach sing along Disney status, the other songs, the original songs, they're all still there - not the same quality, because again, Emma Watson can't sing, but at least you could think back to the original and remember how hearing them the first time made you feel. The new songs kind of made me think of James and the Giant Peach, entire songs added to explain things that could literally just be explained in one line of dialogue and it not only felt unnecessary, it felt out of place. Now let's look at the dialogue, this is what happens when you take the original script, you run it through a Thesaurus and you pick the longest possible option for each sentence because that's what they did. News flash to the writers: taking existing dialogue and making it more drawn out does not necessarily make it better, and in this case, it makes it worse. The Beast in the original film, upon his introduction his lines were short but terrifying, he looked like a legitimate threat, this abomination, constantly bickering with Belle and Emma Watson talking to him as if she's making another speech about woman's right, it's painful to sit through. Basically, it was like the writers didn't understand the source material they were working from, little things like the scene where Belle and the Beast are playing in the snow; in the original, that song is sung as an inner monologue, making not only us, but them realize that they are secretly developing feelings for each other, here they belt it out like a scene from 'The Sound of Music', no inner monologue, they just sing it as if the other won't hear them 5 feet away. The moment in the original, after the Beast releases Belle and Cogsworth asks him why, and he answers ""because I love her"", that line was important, because he was not only admitting it to them, he was finally admitting it to himself...here they give it to Mrs. Potts, even the scene with him giving her the library, I guess I didn't hate the spin they gave it here, but in the original this was his moment where he had completely put himself aside and wanted to show her that he cares about her...here he kinda does it too, but in that nonchalant manner that still kinda makes him look like an arrogant prick. I could literally still rant on for hours about everything I disliked about this film, but I doubt anyone is still reading, so let me just conclude by saying...I hated this damn remake, really really hated it, but: the girl I saw it with loved it, she loved it so much that I actually felt bad ripping into it after, and watching her face light up with excitement at every awful scene was, to me, much more entertaining than the actual movie...so maybe, based on that, I'll say guys: you're going to hate this, girls: you might not...but frankly, see it anyway, I actually want to hear your thoughts. Am I just being petty? I really want to hear your feedback, and actually, I'm hoping you say I'm wrong because this was still a pretty movie: the set work, the art direction, this is Oscar worthy stuff and it's beautiful to look at, so I know they put effort into it and I almost feel bad ripping it apart as badly as I did, so if you find something redeeming here, tell me, I want to hear you out."

"nbmartino","6","17","34","16 March 2017"," Watered down, dull retelling of a timeless classic with questionable choices
","When you take a timeless classic like Beauty and the Beast, one of few animated films in history to ever to be nominated for best picture, you know there's going to be trouble at the idea of remaking an otherwise flawless film (that's not to say the original was one hundred perfect, but near darn close!). But this is corporate Disney at it's best, trying to take something that was so special and rehash it for more money instead of creating something entirely new. <br/><br/>It's no question that animation is an extremely difficult medium to translate into live action. From a creative (non-financial) standpoint it's controversial on whether or not certain films should be done in the first place, as they can be difficult to recreate...and this version of Beauty and the Beast is the perfect example of this. With questionable CGI, wooden leads, a weak script and an absolutely atrocious rendition of Howard Ashman/Alan Menken's beloved 1991 score you have to wonder where Disney went wrong. What were they thinking?<br/><br/>Let's start off with the good: the production values of the film are breathtaking, make no mistake. The sets and costumes bring Belle's world to life as if the animation was real. Belle's village is nearly an identical replica of the cartoon and Beast Castle's looks absolutely stunning. Every last detail from the way Beast's servants are animated to the transformation sequences look fantastic. The cast for the most part is competently cast and acted, with Luke Evans hamming it up as Gaston and Josh Gad stealing the show with Lefou. Kevin Kline brings a charming new rendition of Maurice as do Ewan McGregor, Ian McKellen, and Emma Thompson as Lumiere, Cogsworth, and Mrs. Pots respectively. The script changes Disney made to expand the lore of the curse as well as provide more backstory on Belle and the Beast were a welcome change. Two new songs added to the film, ""Evermore,"" and ""How Does this Moment Last Forever?"" are pretty, but almost make the film seem overstuffed. Some subtle moments that were changed also may rub some the wrong way, however. The script itself didn't add anything new and at times felt awkward.<br/><br/>Emma Watson and Dan Stevens, unfortunately, are horribly miscast as Belle and Beast. While Dan Stevens' vocal tone and inflections make a decent Beast, there is absolutely zero chemistry with his costar Emma Watson. On paper Emma is a wonderful choice for Belle. Not only does she look the part but she is a wonderful role model for kids. Sadly she merely does not have the acting ability to pull off Belle convincingly. Belle here lacked the innocence and charm of her animated counterpart. This especially shows in the scenes Belle has with Lumiere and the rest of the servants. And the unfortunate mistake of having Disney decide to keep the musical numbers from the legendary songwriting duo Alan Menken/Howard Ashman is where the magic is utterly destroyed. Not only is it absolutely unacceptable on Disney's part to cast two people who do not come from musical backgrounds to lead a musical, (for the most part Beauty and the Beast is considered a musical) but it is also an insult to Menken/Ashman's legacy. If Howard Ashman were alive today he would be outraged. A huge part of the original's charm is the music, and the soul behind the characters. Instead of hearing the powerful, heartfelt notes and chords that describe Belle's longing for change, we hear soft, heavily processed, robotic renditions of ""Belle"" and ""Something There."" It doesn't help Steven's singing voice sounds like an old fart. If Disney really wanted Emma's face so badly they could have at least dubbed her voice. While Gad, Evans, McGregor, and Thompson pick up the slack a little bit in their musical numbers, the music still falls flat. To add insult to injury the instrumental score was almost entirely rewritten by Menken for this film. What happened to those quiet, powerful rhythms when Belle is exploring the castle in the West Wing, or the dramatic musical tension where Gaston and Beast have their final battle in the original? All of that is gone. <br/><br/>Minor nitpicks include the CGI; certain parts of the castle seem engineered which was distracting, especially the scene with the wolves. Subtle script changes also removed a lot of the charming little character moments that were present in the original. Lumiere, Cogsworth, Mrs. Potts and Chip unfortunately suffered the worse from this with barely any screen time. Lefou and Maurice were actually an improvement over their animated counterparts, which was great. The changes they made with the enchantress were also wonderful.<br/><br/>Beauty and the Beast overall is a watered down, dull retelling of timeless classic. Now that's not to say this film is completely terrible; children and families who have never seen the original will eat up the gorgeous cinematography, charming characters and the lavish musical numbers. But for those who are classic-goers like me looking for an imaginative retelling, Disney's newest 2017 remake of Beauty and the Beast clearly shows that it doesn't hold a candle to it's predecessor. For those looking for a passionate, powerful, and inspiring film, do yourself a huge favor and turn on the animated version instead. On it's own the film is below average, if not awful, at best. 3/5 for an adaptation, 2/5 as a standalone."
"Ziggyzorro","10","24","51","10 March 2017"," What a wonderful musical
","Seems nobody likes fun anymore, because you couldn't have made this film any better. The 1946 version is amazing and so is this live action retelling, with a rearranged score by Alan Menken and new songs. The cast completely knocks it out of the park. Emma Watson's Belle is enchanting and it turns out she has an outstanding singing voice. The supporting cast is enthralling especially Luke Evans as Gaston and Josh Gad as LeFou. Dan Steven's brings the Beast to life and the story-line and progression of him and Belle is even better than the cartoon. More emotional, more realistic and yet this film is just as if not more magical. Visually it is grand and the costumes and set design make you feel inside a fantasy world. All the hatred clearly are from people who didn't want to even see this film in the first place. Bill Condon, screenwriter of Chicago and director of Dreamgirls, directs a massively entertaining spectacle, this is the Disney live action musical everyone has been waiting for. Especially Disney, who wanted to make a live action version decades ago. Forget La La Land, this is a musical with a classically sounding cast."

","*****Spoiler Alert *****<br/><br/>So I went to see Beauty and the Beast as the film I wanted to see had juuuuuuust started and I don't like to miss even 30 seconds of a film.<br/><br/>I've only ever seen the original cartoon once when it came out, however many years ago, so don't remember it that well.<br/><br/>This film looks beautiful, the sets and locations are wonderful, but it does;t look nearly as good as Cinderella funnily enough. For me it all look far too fake and yes I know it's a musical and that's not real, but I was constantly aware that I was watching a film, rather than getting into the film.<br/><br/>I found the whole film strangely boring, I was looking at my watch, wondering why everything took so long to happen and why we had to be told three or four times that Gaston was the baddie, especially where there were no other suitable candidates around.<br/><br/>Emma whats-her-face who plays Belle is terribly terribly dull, and really doesn't do much of the acting, which is a shame as she has been good as a supporting actress before, and maybe this is too much? <br/><br/>The Beast looks silly, and does't quite work as a beast. too much CGI or not enough one of the two.<br/><br/>Kevin Kline is excellent, as is Mr candle-stick and Fat-clock. But Emma Thompson set my teeth on edge as the 'east-end' common-as-much Mrs Potts. Too much of the acting thing here.<br/><br/>The songs are all exactly the same as before and I would have though someone with a bit of vision might have jazzed them up a bit. <br/><br/>The kids in the cinema seemed to love it but I just felt it was desperately un-imaginative. Give me Kong: Skull Island any day."
"shelbylyn-92984","4","14","27","1 April 2017"," Disappointing
","I think even if you've never seen beauty and the beast certain parts of this movie still wouldn't be acceptable. As everyone is saying and I can also affirm, this COULD have been a great movie. I love Emma Watson but she was a complete miscast. At no point did her singing ever sound real or natural it was auto tuned beyond belief. I felt like I was listening to a computer. I think even if they dubbed her singing over it would've been a stronger choice. Occasionally even some of her lines are delivered very dryly which I found sad because I was really rooting for her to prove everyone wrong. Everyone else was great. The beast I think was a miscast too though, after he transforms at the end you'll find something just looks and feels awkward and not very Prince like about him. Just go watch the original. The issue with Hollywood is they're more concerned with $ than taking the time to cast the right people even if they have to be unknowns who can at least hold a tune. If you want to see amazing live action stick with Favreau's films and go watch Jungle Book or wait for his live action lion king. His films are never a let down."

This movie was an absolute joy to behold! I've heard talk of distractions etc with the Beast in their effort to keep a touch of humanity to his otherwise inhuman face, but I just didn't care. It was joyous. Ewan McGreggor nearly steals the movie as LeFluer, and Emma Watson is a delight.<br/><br/>Probably above all, the nonsense of Lefoo (sp?) is nonsense!

So many questions were answer and so many things that they were add for the good of the movie. Emma Watson and Dan Steven were great , I have no doubt that other people would thing that they were wrong cast but they make sense for me. The chemistry between those two was great and even one point of the movie I kind of hate Emma Watson for leaving the beast. Also musically speaking I would like to said that most people are expecting beautiful voices in this movie. True , and what I heard was beautiful I don't care what people said about Emma and Dan couldn't sing they sing great and wonderful, they were themselves and that what sale the movie for me the unique and own voice trying to make more real the tales as old as time. Dan song Evermore deserve more than just a price deserve a Oscar and I would be so mad if he doesn't get at least for best song in the track. I think they took this outside the box and that was good for some people other would disagree because they fail in love with the original one but this one was what they want something new that would bring all ages to the cinema to enjoy and remember those years when were growing up an love to watch this movie.

"kane_1371-117-231060","5","19","40","17 March 2017"," hear warming at times
","Lets make it clear this movie is not horrible but it leaves you unsatisfied. This is the second Disney classic being remade into a live action film with an almost exact 1|1 replication the other one being Jungle book and while I liked both movies I have to say this movie fell a little bit farther from the tree than what you would want. The big problem here was underdeveloped characters. The animation at less time could develop the characters far better and I wonder why that is. The thing that was amiss here was almost any passion put in by the actors except for GASTON! Luke Evans stole the show with his depiction of Gaston he was evil and selfish and arrogant through and through and we could believe him. Lefou portrayed by Josh Gad was a more endearing character than in the animation since here he had more characteristics than: ""he just is a dumb and evil dude"". Here he does deliver some of the lines that in the animation were delivered with little to no meaning with new take and his growing distrust for Gaston is a nice take however he is more like a clown than a gay man that wants nothing more than being recognized by Gaston. It would have been much better for his character to make an active decision to leave Gaston behind instead of a decision out of petty revenge. He could have easily been there to help break free Belle and his father. Now then lets get to Belle's father, he is just not there! This character is so bland and empty we could have easily done this without him. Gone is the adventurous inventor of the animation whose influence you clearly could see on Belle. Instead you get an artist with few dialogues and a face that is devoid of emotions. He is not endearing and warm and this in turn hurts Belle. The other side cast includes Sir Ian Mckellen a supreme actor that his voice is heard through the lifeless cgi but can do little to make the cgi character come to life as the CGI is done with a boring color pallet and the character designs for the color pallet used are too complex and make it hard to see their expressions and movements specially when you deal with Lumiere and Cogsworth since there is a lot of metallic golden shades used on them which makes their different body parts less than recognisable. Emma Thompson is there and and I couldn't care less, it has been a long time that I have lost all interest for her work and this movie didn't help either. Then we go to Belle. Oh boy what am I to say, Emma Watson is a Harry Potter child and has been doing good. However Emma Watson was kind of underwhelming here and I don't know if it is the Harry Potter movies creeping through the image reminding one of all the other times you have seen her in similar situations or the fact that Belle has been hurt by the Maurice (father) character. She is good, she can sing, she can deliver the lines very well but the whole thing is just very bland and I think I know what the real issue is: the cgi leaves little for actor to work with. It seems like she has not evolved much beyond her Harry Potter years.<br/><br/>The Beast has been butchered! his character's complexity, out of the window and the cgi makes him even less relatable. In the animation from the very beginning you see that he is a creature with feelings and intelligence, Beast is built with real scenes and dialogues not some exposition on how ""His father was cruel and when he lost his mother he became like his father"". Here we get far less dialogues from Beast and the emotion's all gone. His scenes are few and too far inbetween. He does not show any emotion except rage and hate early on so that when he does show up to save Belle it makes no sense. His change into a kind character comes out of the blue and leaves you wondering what happened. Also when Belle leaves we get a Beast that is depressing not mournful like what you saw of him in the animation where he is roaring and howling into the sky, Here he is on top of the tower under rain with head lowered and just looking down like he is Bruce Wayne or something. what is going on here? I do not know what happened during production of this movie, but it certainly was not good. The movie somehow manages to deliver on almost every scene in the original and every line but with very little enthusiasm and passion leaving it feeling like a cheap knock off and not the authentic remake done by Disney.<br/><br/>The songs are good and bring that nostalgia feeling but that is it. It seemed some lyrics were modified for no reason. There were 2 new songs if I'm not wrong and the ""When we are human again"" was gone which was sad because that song was very important in building up the side cast and castle.<br/><br/>Why was the enchantress still around? Why didn't she punish Gaston? Also what is up with that book she left Beast as a punishment? Some stuff make zero sense. As mentioned the songs are there and the nostalgia factor is there and these two plus Evans and Gad are the saving grace of this movie which is a shame because it could have been far better. All in all there were scenes that tears welled up in my eyes because of the nostalgia, this was most prevalent during the songs. I give this movie a 6 out of 10 meaning above average. I just hope that if Disney does make another live action remake they address the issues in this movie."
"nicolemortensen","4","14","28","22 March 2017"," Dull, Boring and Doesn't Do the Original Justice
","Out of all the Disney remakes, I think this one might the worst.<br/><br/>I'll give credit where it's due, the movie is really gorgeous. And the actors playing the servants are all fantastic. In fact, I think they're the best part of the movie to be honest. Luke Evans is hilarious as Gaston and Josh Gad was a fantastic Le Fou. The music was decent but they added two new songs. Days in the Sun is fine until Watson starts singing and Evermore was pretty good.<br/><br/>But in all complete honesty, this movie is just not that great.<br/><br/>First of all, why did they cast Emma Watson? She is not a singer and you can tell in this movie. Why cast a singer if she can't sing? Not only that but she looks bored throughout the whole movie. Also, the romance between her and Beast never feels realized. It seems like the Beast cares more about Belle. <br/><br/>There is also this random subplot about Belle's mother that goes nowhere. It feels really awkward and there was zero reason for it to be in the film. <br/><br/>But my biggest pet peeve is that they cast one of the greatest vocalist of all time, Audra McDonald, as the wardrobe.<br/><br/>Are you kidding me!?<br/><br/>She has the best voice in the whole entire movie and they stick her as the wardrobe!? Why?!<br/><br/>I say skip this movie unless you have little girls who are dying to see it."
"g-51840","3","18","38","19 March 2017"," No idea how reviews are as good as they are.
","*SPOILERS* Let me just say, I came into this movie ready to hate it. The original classic is my second favorite Disney movie ever (Aladdin being the first), and based on my distaste for Cinderella and the cash cow that is Disney trying to milk all the money it can from a popular property annoys the hell out of me. But, as it would happen, I enjoyed myself more than I thought. However, this was a low, LOW bar to clear. Let me start off with the good: Kevin Kline as the father. I thought he did a really good job and I totally bought the relationship between him and Belle. Josh Gad as Lefou. Honestly, he was hilarious in this movie, and the scene in which he's singing in Gaston's tavern brought about a moment I can't spoil here because of it's hilarity. The movie on that note is also very funny, I did find myself laughing ore than once or twice during the film. I also thought the voice acting for the objects was good, especially the man who played Lumiere. The casting, overall, was OK. I could see Emma Watson as Belle, and the guy who played Gaston was fun enough to watch. But now we get into the bad stuff. The singing. For the most part it's pretty good, except for one person, and this is the fatal flaw, and that is Emma Watson as Belle. All throughout the movie you can tell whenever she sang the auto-tune was cranked up to 11, because her voice never sounds human. Honestly, this brought her performance down a lot for me. Then there's the sound design itself. In the beginning, there was a song that was going on, but the background noise was so much that I could barely hear what they were saying, and that continued a lot throughout the entire movie. Then there those CGI effects. Good God on green Earth, I hated how fake everything looked in the movie. In an animated realm, everyone can work off each other. In live action, human actors are there looking at balls of Play-doh or whatever they use to see the effects, and none of them ever looked real or alive. There is an especially weird addition with having the feather duster be a dove(?) And the worst sin of all is the main characters themselves, the Beast and Belle. First of all, to go along with the effects subject, the beast looks terrible. His face looks the weirdest because it looks like the CGI animators tried to give him an almost humanoid face, which DIDN'T work. But first let's talk bout him as a character. When Belle is forced to stay in the castle, he shows sympathy by giving her a nice bedroom and ATTEMPTING to invite her to dinner. However, in this version, you see none of that sympathy. Instead, the objects get her from the dungeon, they provide with a bedroom. Hell, he gets outright furious with Lumiere and Cogsworth for providing her with a room. With all this sympathy taken away from him, it's really hard for me to buy the romance between the Beast and Belle.They also try to delve into a backstory of his, saying he had a cruel father, but the most ""delving"" they do is just mentioning that he had a cruel father. And then there is Belle. In the original, she's a smart, kind, and loving person. Here, I actually saw her someone of a jerk. When Gaston, who isn't nearly as douchey as he should be in the movie, kindly asks her to dinner, she denies him like some Mean Girls pre-Madonna. She also has almost no life or personality throughout the entire movie. Overall, Beauty and the Beast 2017 was a shameless cash grab with none of the heart or charm of the original movie."

","This is a proper example of when you have a talented cast, beautiful sets, exquisite costumes, CGI and one of the story of a Disney princess you can still make a hot mess out of it.<br/><br/>Personally I found the overall direction to be extremely horrible. The story was not at all exciting. I was surprised with how much boring it was compared to the other princess stories I've read and watched in animated or live form. Even, growing up this story as a book was one of my favorites. But surprisingly with that type of content this director made the worst Disney movie so far.<br/><br/>The acting felt average from all the performers. I had big expectations form Emma Watson's portrayal of a princess. Sadly she let me down. Perhaps the biggest actors in this movie were in CGI form. So I had to sit through average acting for the human roles and decent voice overs from the good actors for the CGI roles for two long hours. No wonder I was checking the remaining time every 10 minutes.<br/><br/>The only thing this movie might had going for it is the set decoration and costume designing. But if the story falls flat like this it doesn't feel complementary, it feels like pointless show-off.<br/><br/>It eludes me how so many people found it good (It has 7.4 rating when I'm writing this!! it surely will go down). This is something from which Disney should learn what not to do in their future live action princess adaptations. These are the precious stories from every kids childhood. I sincerely hope Disney won't make them this boring on silver screen in the the upcoming movies."
"briannagonnering","2","6","10","20 June 2017"," So so Disappointing :(
","This film was so incredibly disappointing. It was sooooo boring and everything was off. the beast was weird and his acting was terrible. As well as Emma Watson who played belle. She showed little to almost no emotion and her British accent threw me off it didn't fit well with her character. The only good thing about this film was Gaston. The actor who portrayed him did amazing. Honestly worst movie so far of 2017."
"tjblackwell-12115","4","6","10","20 April 2017"," It's fine...
","I was pretty excited for this film when I heard it announced. I am a big fan of the original and I couldn't wait to see a new take on the classic story. I was finally able to watch it a couple of days ago. And I thought it was fine. I believe it is a fun film to watch and I'm glad I saw it. However, unlike the remake of The Jungle Book, the original animated version is better in my opinion. Don't get me wrong, the cast are all fantastic especially Emma Watson, Luke Evans, and Ian McKellen. And watching Be Our Guest performed in live action was spectacular. But I believe the the 1991 version executed some the scenes better than this remake did. Three scenes come to mind. The scene in which Belle take her father's place in the castle. This entire scene felt rather rushed for me, and in the animated version I really believe that Belle is absolutely terrified of the Beast. In the live action version however, the Beast coming into the light seems to be glanced over. The scene where the Beast tries and fails to ask Belle to dinner for the first time. In the original, the Beast totally looses it when Belle refuses to come to dinner. In the remake, he seems angry, but not absolutely enraged. And the scene in which Belle goes into the West Wing against instructions. In the animated version, the West Wing is built up very mysteriously and when Belle does eventually wander in there, she takes the lid off the enchanted rose, and this is the main reason the Beast gets so angry with her. In the remake, Belle doesn't even take the lid off. However, I didn't hate the remake, I just prefer the original. If you gave me the option of which one I would want to watch on movie night, I would pick the 1991 classic in a heartbeat."
"Icedooitle","7","6","10","16 April 2017"," Redundant, but what the heck.
","Upon viewing Jon Favreau's Jungle Book (2015) for the second time, I admired how far a departure it was from its Disney source material. The pillars of familiarity were leaned upon but the films strengths were drawn from some remarkable new ideas and execution. If Bill Condon's Beauty and the Beast (2017) can be admired for anything it is giving the people what they want. Aside from a handful of new songs and character tweaks, this new adaptation is almost painstakingly dutiful to the 1991 Disney feature. There will be some, like me, who find it all a little too redundant; but for the bulk of viewers the relentless nostalgia won't disappoint.<br/><br/>There is no point in prefacing anything with ""spoiler alerts"", as you have already (ostensibly) seen this movie. Belle is the rural French misfit in her small village. Beautiful, but ""a funny girl"" simply because she thinks for herself. Emma Watson portrays Belle capably, but without much range. Her opening number shows promise, hitting her required pitches without unnecessary flourishes. She floats through the lively town square in ennui. The long takes are well crafted and the music plays like a sing-along, kids who know the words will make the theater pretty adorable. Kevin Klein as Belle's father (Maurice) is a bit of a departure from the original. He is not the buffoonish cartoon, but a more haunted widower. The Gaston role is filled with ease by Luke Evans. He is a powerful singer and has the convincing swagger that comes with the territory. His lacky, LeFou (Josh Gad) couldn't be more at home in the movie if he was actually animated. The issue with the vibrancy of the setting is it does offset Belle's dream of escaping the ""boring village.""<br/><br/>Our first glimpse of the castle actually occurs in the prologue. The arrogant and spoiled Prince hosts a glamorous ball that's little more than an embarrassment of decadence. A former plot hole is filled when it's explained that curse affects more than the castle. The local villagers are cleared of any memory of the castle and its dwellers. Years pass and Maurice has the misfortune of taking a fateful wrong turn to the castle. From this point on the CGI absorbed setting just doesn't live up to the first act. Famous names voice the cursed inhabitants, Ewan McGregor, Ian McKellan, Stanley Tucci, and Emma Thompson. Once Belle arrives on the scene the ""Be Our Guest"" number can't arrive fast enough. Once it does, I'll confess to being a bit disappointed. As the song played I couldn't help but have the Orbach track playing in unison to McGregor's and it became all too clear I was watching a remake, and only a passable one.<br/><br/>I would say that the film is entirely unnecessary, were it not for the amazing title number. I was not sure who had voiced Mrs. Potts through the film. As the vocals began for the ""Beauty and the Beast"" dance, I would have put money on Julie Andrews. I was pleased to find that it was Emma Thompson, every bit the equal of Angela Lansbury. <br/><br/>Much has been made about certain political elements in the film, (I.E. Homo-erogeny, diversity.) These are trivial. Had the film developed these elements into more daring areas, it may have provided some very welcome spice to the proceedings. This is a beautiful movie, but comes up short in ways I might be too apathetic to articulate. I craved something that the film may never have intended to provide. If I had to boil this review down to one adjective I'd say ""harmless."" Not a glowing recommendation, but you're likely to get exactly what you want out of itÂ… just not an inch more."
"crazy_smilers","7","6","10","2 April 2017"," Better than expected.
","Okay I was not too thrilled over the movie by the time it was coming out. First announced yes. I wasn't so happy to see it anymore because Emma Watson got the role of Belle. I like Emma but prefer unknown women as the classic princesses. Even when I heard Angelina was Maleificent but I LOVED her in the role after all. So with Emma, I didn't love it but she suited the part. Did rather well and I was pleased. <br/><br/>After the beast transformed at the end I was smitten with Matthew from Downton Abbey. Lol Oh how I miss thee. The show is no more. <br/><br/>Another thing was the other characters. I did not like their new looks. That also wasn't so bad when watching. Although I much prefer Lumiere and his women more like how they were. The bird is weird. Oh and Mrs Potts, I miss the spout being her nose. Well I liked the cartoon ones much more but I wasn't as bothered by these ones as I had thought. Same for the beast. In the posters and ads he looked extra ugly but when watching it he was actually similar to the Disney beast. <br/><br/>Lastly I thought this was going to be a whole new telling of the tale but it was actually a retelling of the classic which I actually enjoyed possibly more than a new creative spin. Including the classic songs. That made me happy. Wasn't a fan of the new songs added but oh well. <br/><br/>So all in all. I liked it better than I had expected. Now I want to watch the Disney one. Lol"
"Ed-Shullivan","10","19","42","17 March 2017"," Walt would be ""OH"" so very proud of this live version...so where is all this hate coming from?
","As any parent should be proud of their children so is father Maurice (Kevin Kline) of his only child, his daughter Belle (Emma Watson) who could never imagine herself swooning over the town's handsome and one-dimensional Ox named Gaston who was played by Luke Evans quite well. Gaston is really in love with himself and he realizes if he wants to have little Gaston's to continue bearing his name then he wants to marry the smartest, prettiest and the only woman in the town who he just cannot convince to marry him, and that young lady happens to be Belle.<br/><br/>I am not a big fan of musicals and as an example I was most displeased to have to sit through the 2014 Disney live version of Into the Woods. Once Emma Watson commenced singing her opening song Ms. Shullivan grabbed my arm just a little bit tighter and I just knew this was going to be another Disney classic...and it is!<br/><br/>There are so many first class performers in this film such as Ewan McGregor who plays Luminere the candelabra, Ian McKellan who plays Cogsworth the mantle clock, the classy Emma Thompson who is no stranger to appearing in Disney films so she plays Mrs. Potts and by default Belle's conscience while she resides in the Beast's castle. Other great performances were on display by Audra McDonald who plays Madame Garderobe, and I cannot forget Stanley Tucci who plays Maestro Cadenza and of course Gaston's flunky sidekick the gay LeFou played perfectly by Josh Gad.<br/><br/>Some countries apparently are uncomfortable with LeFou being a bit more interested in Gaston than he should be but let's face it, this is the year 2017, and so any film should embrace actors/actresses that reflect today's society. In fact if I would have been asked for my opinion by the producers for any suggestions, without hesitation although I truly believe the six (6) foot Luke Evans performance as Gaston was excellent, I would have suggested an alternate name to play Gaston. Or at least give the six (6) foot four (4) inch retired NFL Hall of Fame defensive end, the gap tooth super handsome Michael Strahan to be provided an opportunity to test for the role of Gaston. Strahan would have been great and he would also have allowed a new generation of young children to see that Disney films have evolved to be inclusive when selecting starring roles.<br/><br/>Okay so for those naysayers who want to compare this version of Beauty and the Beast to earlier versions, and compare actual Disney characters, or actors/actresses, or the songs style and/or the singers who sing them, I suggest you just close your eyes and please just try to imagine yourself as a very younger version of your own self. If you do this and then fast forward to your adult self you will wake up to see that we are in the year 2017, and that good producers attempt to be more inclusive if the story allows for it and in most cases Disney films such as this great Disney Classic, Beauty and the Beast does. So I loved seeing the diversity in the ballroom scene, I loved Emma Watson and Luke Wilson's gradual affection for each other, I loved Josh Gad's closing scene where he finds his mate, and although I am still not convinced that CGI is an essential part, or for that matter 3-D film versions when I see the younger crowd mesmerized by this film, then I can accept it...and maybe some of you naysayers should be a bit more open minded.<br/><br/>I know this live version of Beauty and the Beast will do extremely well at both the box office and when it is eventually released in the retail stores on DVD/Blu Ray format, or streaming one day on NetFlix, or some other new format, such as when humans eventually live on another planet. Walt Disney himself had this kind of endless imagination where others did not and I just know he would have been very proud of all the performances of this cast, the cinematography and of course the musical score.<br/><br/>FOOTNOTE: Mrs. Shullivan and I did like the 1991 animated version, but we are in agreement on this next point...we enjoyed this 2017 live version a lot more!!!<br/><br/>I rate this Disney Classic a perfect 10 out of 10. It is definitely a keeper."
"rongrengaa","1","9","17","27 May 2017"," Very ambiguous
","This is bad, I mean real bad movie. How can Disney make Beauty and the Beast this awful? I mean, watch the movie and you'll know that it's clearly don't have atmosphere (genre), the cast just dance around and singing I think this'll end up as one of toddler bluray's movies collection, but shame this is not funny at all. This is not a drama, I can't feel the comedy, and the beast don't give me a thriller too (I thought this movie is gonna darker than the 2014 french version, but it's too light!). So what exactly is this movie genre? It feels empty, non atmosphere cause Disney make the people who watch became so lost and find it boring. Except for the toddlers."

","Beauty and the Beast is back in a combination live action and animation. Add a few new songs for award consideration. Great sets and art direction all combine for an excellent movie experience.<br/><br/>Emma Watson as Belle is convincing and her prince is best in beast mood. The supporting cast works hard and Josh Gad continues to get the buzz for his character. The old songs are comfortable the new ones fit.<br/><br/>The movie is a tad long but once it gets going it moves along at a good pace. While it is appropriate for the entire family, there are a few intense moments that might be tough on younger children.<br/><br/>The movie looks great on the big screen and should be seen in a theater. The 3D added.a few wrinkles but may not be worth the up-charge. This version of the tale as old as time will become a classic that will be continue to be enjoyed on home platforms."

","I have no idea at all what is wrong with all of the salty people writing reviews on this. I went to see it tonight, and I thought it was a wonderful movie, the animated character's had great voice actors. The Beast didn't look terrible like other people on this site are saying. They didn't create a super scary looking Beast that would terrify children. They kept him as close to the original as possible. That might have meant that he didn't look quite as realistic as a horrible beast might look. This isn't a horror movie folks, it's a charming family film. The acting was believable enough to make me tear up at a couple of points, so again, there was nothing wrong with the acting.<br/><br/>The packed movie theater burst into applause as soon as the credits started rolling. People were saying ""wasn't it lovely"" as they were leaving. Therefore, people were actually enjoying it.<br/><br/>I give it a 9 out of 10 because I felt that the opening song kinda dragged on a bit and lacked feeling. The rest of the film was great though!

","This movie fails to be interesting, as many mentionned: special effects make you feel like it's a computer game, the face of the beast is weird, actors are not convinced nor convincing, the animated objects are not funny, and the songs feel misplaced. Since the 1991 movie is a classic it seems they played it safe and made a copy of it, which I agree with, however the copy is bad. I would have enjoyed it if we could have seen more of the elements of the old movie. We can't see the main character's feelings evolve like in the cartoon. On a positive note this movie is good to help with sleep and I have played it a few times even if I wasn't able to watch the whole thing at once."

","It's been rather difficult to get on board with Disney's current trend of live action remakes. While there have been a few memorable ones, I believe that ""Beauty and the Beast"" will simply be remembered for relying on nostalgia. There is an echo of similarity between the cartoon we all know and love and this adaptation, but there are also moments of elaboration that fill in particular gaps that might have been questioned in the original. Some moments don't chime as well this time around, but overall, this is a remake that is worth seeing due to the filmmakers sensitivity of honoring what has come before. #beautyandthebeast"
"MUFCOK","5","5","8","27 June 2017"," It's not the worst movie but when compared to the original its not even in the same league
","As a fan of the original Walt Disney Beauty and the Beast I was quite looking forward to seeing the live action adaption of the story. The trailers looked interesting and following on from Jungle Book last year, I was hoping for a similarly impressive remake.<br/><br/>Beauty and the Beast is a story many of us will know, A poor farm girl gets taken hostage by a Beast, who is under a spell to stop him from returning the his human form as a Prince. The only way the Beast can return to his previous form is if he learns to love another and is loved in return. 'Only true love can break the spell', as it were. <br/><br/>One of my biggest gripes about this movie was that the auto tune is simply horrific. If an actress cannot sing then an actress cannot sing, simple as that. You could try singing and editing it slightly to make do, or you could simply recast the actress and get someone in who can actually sing, to star in a musical, a Disney musical. What you shouldn't do it auto tune the life out of someone's voice to the point that it sounds as far away from lifelike as possible. However, saying that, all the original songs are there, and even if they are sang badly, they still gave me some nice nostalgia. <br/><br/>Following on from the recent Jungle Book adaptation which delivered some of the most impressive CGI that I have ever seen so I was expecting much of the same here. Some of the shots and sequences looked very sharp and beautiful with vibrant colour. Some of the scenes with the live household goods looked impressive and the shots of the castle generally looked very good - especially the library scene and the dancing scenes. However some of the backdrops and landscapes looked quite poor at times, the scene in which Belle runs to the top of the hill near the start of the movie singing and we get a panoramic shot, it simply screams 'green-screen'. The Beast looks cheap at times and not what he should look like, his movements are often not too lifelike and rather wooden. They used motion capture for The Beast to make him as lifelike as possible but when you compare that to movies such as The Planet of the Apes franchise and how they move, you can really see the difference in quality. The scenes in the villages look like something out of a stage play, with lots of close up shots and choppy camera work.<br/><br/>My motto is 'if it isn't broke, don't fix it'. Beauty and the Beast stayed true to the original story with only a couple of subplots and changes, but even with that in mind, it really was missing the magic of the original. The great thing about the animation Beauty and the Beast was the way it connected with us on an emotional, really heartfelt level. A cartoon story between a girl and a Beast, crammed into a runtime of under 90 minutes could still deliver heart and emotion, something which the new adaptation completely missed. The scenes between Belle and The Beast feel awkward. The characters were all very bland and not once did I feel invested or rooting for any of them. Something was definitely missing here. In the original the Beast was a beast for much more of his life and was more out of touch of human interaction however in this version he was transformed into a beast much later on in his life and subsequently is more intellectual, meaning that the relationship he has with Belle is more on a human level.   <br/><br/>The movie felt 30 minutes too long, at just over a 2 hour runtime I felt it dragging around the middle period. The pacing was a little off and I did find it boring as time went on.<br/><br/>Overall, I have very mixed opinions on Beauty and the Beast. Part of me liked it and part of me didn't. It seemed to do an OK job of retelling the story but ultimately felt flat and emotionless. It's a beautiful story which is completely driven on emotion however we really didn't see much emotion and that was disappointing. It isn't as impressive as Jungle Book and it is leagues behind the original Beauty and the Beast animated movie.<br/><br/>5/10"
"afschuetter","8","5","8","28 May 2017"," Original still better but I was not disappointed
","Although it wasn't as good as the original (because the originals are almost always better than remakes) it was still an amazing movie. Personally, I think the cast was wonderful and all fit their part very well, even though at some points I could hear how they changed Emma's voice to make it sound better (which didn't really work). I loved how close it was to the animated version while still being original in its own way. There are some things that could have been changed that I saw people mention in other reviews but besides those I still thought it was a great movie overall. Another thing I loved was the diversity of the cast. I liked how they included more people of color than a lot of other movies I've seen and how they also made LeFou and the guy at the end gay because it really appealed more to me as a viewer and I'm sure many other people, besides the people who disagree with same sex couples who don't want to watch a great movie just because of someone's implied sexuality. I'm glad that Disney stepped up and added more diversity to one of their movies because it is something that needs to be more widely accepted and happen more often in other movies and hopefully Disney helped open up that door and others will follow in their footsteps. <br/><br/>TLDR; I loved the diversity although some things could have improved a bit."

","First of all - I love the original cartoon version. It was the beautiful memory from my childhood and it will stay that way. As many of other classic Disney cartoons. I am so happy, that Disney made the live version of Beauty and The Beast, cause they did it right in my opinion.<br/><br/>They cut the bits that were...let's say it politely, confusing and leaving questions. Instead they've add nice scenes and dialogues that are adding more depth to the characters.<br/><br/>WARNING! SLIGHTLY SPOILING! :) <br/><br/>I love that Le-Fou has more character than just a comic relief, that he sees what Gaston has become and doesn't agree with it. Also Gaston character is much more interesting when he is explaining why he is after Belle and not the girls that adore him. :)<br/><br/>I am really impressed how Emma Watson is singing. That is a really nice surprise.<br/><br/>One little minus of the movie (which made me give it 9 and not 10) was the one song where you can listen about Beast's childhood. You could clearly hear the auto-tune at the beginning, but otherwise it wasn't that bad. If I want to be picky, I would say that some of the songs were sang in a strange pace compared to the cartooned versions. I still love them thou.<br/><br/>I absolutely love the effects in this movie. ""Be our guest"" scene looks amazing in every way and the Beauty and the Beast dance took my breath away. :)<br/><br/>The ending makes so much more sense than the classic cartoon version, where Belle says the magic words just in the nick of time. Here it is more realistic and believable to me. :)<br/><br/>Will I watch the movie again? Absolutely! I've enjoyed way to much to just forget it. :)"

There's nothing interesting done with the premise, the characters feel flat and lifeless, the musical numbers are ""meh"", and the graphics don't even reflect the big budget nature of the film; some things actually manage to look bad. The hype for the film can clearly be attributed just to marketing and it coasting on the original's reputation.

I was mostly impressed by how beautiful this film looks. The CGI is really good in this.

I'm just so impressed at them actually winning. There is one thing that really bothers me. This film was advertised as having the first openly gay Disney character, even though LaFour only dances with a man for a few seconds.

","This movie should have been called Gaston and LeFou because they share more chemistry than the titular characters. I'm convinced that the casting of Emma Watson had more to do with cashing in on name recognition than acting ability. After all, the generation that grew up with Beauty and the Beast also grew up with Harry Potter. Unfortunately, Watson seems to have graduated from the Kristen Stewart school of acting that entails keeping the same blank expression with her mouth slightly agape. I could forgive her auto tuned singing if she had brought some interesting characterization to Belle but she didn't. It doesn't help that a lot of the dialog in this film is directly copied from the script of the 1991 animated version because it leads to unfavorable comparisons. Also, the Beast's CGI looks terrible. They should have stuck with practical effects. Speaking of the Beast, he doesn't show the same range of emotions that the animated one does and is completely forgettable. The only musical number in which anyone looks like they are having any fun is ""Gaston."" Speaking of musical numbers, the only thing more disappointing than Emma Watson's singing is Emma Thompson's singing. The entire ballroom scene falls flat because of her.

But don't let that dissuade you from seeing this delightful revision of the classic tale. The live-action Beauty and the Beast is truly dazzling.<br/><br/>Emma Watson is a fantastic actress and clearly one of my favorite actresses because of her work as Hermione Granger but, to be honest, I don't feel she's pretty enough to be Belle. But...she just manages to pull it off.<br/><br/>However, Luke Evans is the PERFECT Gaston. He's devilshly handsome and yet so conceited and awful at the same time. I can't imagine anyone else playing him.<br/><br/>All in all, I've seen this film three times now so yeah, I like it."

","This movie was one of the few that turned out not half-bad with recreation. ""Be Our Guest"" disappointed with its slight lackluster (I'm sure the actors tried their best, and I give kudos of course), yet the addition of more background and specifics in the characters captured my attention. It gave more of a relationship between Belle and the Beast, along with all of the castle servants. Things seemed much less like a case of Stockholm Syndrome turned to budding romance this time around.<br/><br/>It keeps most aspects of the original, which is what I most like, and simply builds onto that. Past plot holes sewed up with new patchwork to make it more of a complete story - As a movie like this should. While Disney is overdoing the live-action versions of everything just a smidge, I'll just remain here, enjoying this one that came out beautifully."

","**Spoilers**
When I first saw this movie, I knew there was something wrong that I couldn't place, so I said it was a good movie. I was blinded by the shiny product that Disney was trying to convince me was better than the animated movie they made years ago. The original Beauty and the Beast is a classic in every sense of the word, to the point that it was nominated for Best Picture by the Oscars (and for my money, would have won if Silence of the Lambs didn't come out that same year). There is so much I need to say about this, so I am just going to list everything wrong with it. This is just my opinion.<br/><br/>1. Emma Watson has very little emotional range here. She always comes off as either smug when she is supposed to be happy, or disgusted when she is trying to be vulnerable.
2. The Beast acts too human for a man who was transformed into a hairy, mangy Beast for so long.
3. Belle and the Beast bonding over having dead mothers is not romance material.
4.The teleporting book takes away the importance of the mirror to the outside world.
5.The teleporting book is not used to get Belle back home at the end.
6. Emma Watson's singing is robotic and her vocal range is amateur. She just needed more proper training.
7. Finding out what happened to Belle's mother does not further the plot.
8. Plumette mentions to Lumiere that ""this plan of yours is dangerous."" How is the plan dangerous at all?
9. Why were the servants cursed more severely than the Beast? They didn't deserve it. If the reason was that they didn't make the Prince less cruel, weren't they just following orders? Is this an example of punishing the powerless?
10. The Enchantress erased memory of government and tore families apart. What is her problem? That is morally skewed.
11. In French, ""le fou"" stands for ""the fool"". Need I say more?
12. The weather immediately turns to winter near the castle. whats the point? If anyone was near the castle, they would wonder about those weather patterns, and get closer to investigate. That attracts more people to the castle, so the Beast was surely not alone all those years.
13. If the castle keeps crumbling after each rose petal falls, why does the entire castle not crumble after the flower is fully wilted?
14, Why did Gaston not die by his own doing? He just dies because the castle is falling apart.
15. Why is Belle not the only one wearing blue in the village? That seperates her from the townspeople.
16. Why is Maurice going to the market when Belle was just at the market?
17. Why does Audra McDonolad not sing a full length song when she has one of the best vocal ranges ever?<br/><br/>There are a few positives in this remake though.<br/><br/>1. Maurice is a less eccentric inventor, which helps establish his more familial connection to Belle.
2. The older style costumes of the townspeople were very effective for their status.
3. The Beast's new song ""Evermore"" and Maurice's scene at the beginning were bittersweet.
4. Seeing the castle staff turn into antiques was sad.
5. Josh Gad and Luke Evans as Lefou and Gaston were solid representations of their characters.
6. The song ""Gaston"" and ""The Mob Song"" were nicely staged.<br/><br/>I truly do not understand the worship and hype around this movie.The reason why I like some of the other remakes is because they had significant changes to the plot and characters, like Cinderella, Pete's Dragon, The Jungle Book, and Maleficent. If you like this movie without acknowledging at least one of the flaws I have brought up, that is okay. But you must at least respect my opinion. That is enough for me."

Of course, there's CGI, but that's to be expected in this type of movie.

","This highly anticipated live action recreation of a much loved Disney classic did not disappoint.
The all star cast with the likes of Ewan McGregor, Ian Mckellen and Emma Thompson gave us some of the most comical and memorable moments including some spectacular musical numbers - all of which were sung to perfection.<br/><br/>Emma Watson's portrayal of Bell was very well executed and she managed to set the tone of the film to a comfortable understated level which set us up for the comparison of the future magical moments we would see later on.<br/><br/>Luke Evans as Gaston was the perfect casting choice. He encapsulated the humerous arrogance and masoginistic nature of the character to a tee and made him as likable as any villain you love to hate. An excellent singing voice worthy of the original classic. His sidekick lefou played by the very talented Josh Gad provided some excellent liners and a great musical performance in the song 'Gaston' with co star Evans.<br/><br/>Dan Stevens' beastly voice was also a casting win for me.
His portrayal reminded the audience of the prisoner behind the monster and the innocent remorseful Prince which we grow to route for as his relationship with Bell blossoms.<br/><br/>Visually clever effects throughout with colourful sets and scenery kept me firmly engrossed into the magical world of Disney. The story is a timeless masterpiece and one that director Bill Condon did an excellent job of bringing to life.
I have seen this twice now and would happily watch it again.
Another live action triumph for Disney!"

","Beauty and the Beast is one of my favourite animations of all time. I really loved it and so, when I heard about they are making live action film, I was really looking forward to it. When it's out, I immediately watched it.<br/><br/>The film is so great. I think they made the right choice of choosing Emma Watson as Belle. She's so gorgeous. And that yellow dress is so cool. It's prettier on her. So, I'd say the costume designer has done an amazing job.<br/><br/>The effects on the Beast is quite good. I thought he'd be uglier. But he wasn't that much than I expected. And the performances are also great. I totally was in the movie and forgot the surrounding.<br/><br/>Although it is so perfect, I don't like some of those songs that Belle sung. Maybe I'm not that much into original scores. But I still can accept it.<br/><br/>Overall is that Beauty and the Beast Live Action is a great film and not inferior to the animation. It's on equal state. The film is so good, so, I recommend you all to watch it. You won't regret watching it."
"ticianacamarao","7","3","4","20 January 2019"," Should have been a 10...
","An amazing production and an amazing blend between the musical and the animated film. They only should have spent a bit more on the beast's CGI and the casting of Emma Watson (don't get me wrong, I love the actress but hated her as Belle) was totally wrong. They should have cast someone who could reeeally sing like the rest of the cast and pass emotion through her singing (and no auto-tune). I would say Anne Hathaway would have been perfect. I also missed the song ""Home"" from the musical (they only played a few accords when she first enters her room in the castle, but seeing that singing wasn't Emma's forte I can understand how she wouldn't manage Home) other than that it was really a pleasant experience. But it leaves you with a feeling that it could have been more, and I'm really not used to this feeling when it comes to Disney related things."

"TheMovieDiorama","6","3","4","3 April 2018"," Beauty and the Beast is garnished with glamour but lacks the inner beauty of the original.
","The original hand drawn animation is one of Disney's classics and has garnered acclaim from both critics and audiences. Disney daringly attempted to adapt the tale as old as time with visual effects and live acting. It's able to capture the magical enchanting allure which made the original all so memorable but pales in comparison. Let's face it we all know the story, a prince is cursed and is transformed into a beast and must acquire true love to break the spell. The overall story remained intact and had minor tampering, although some additional backstory elements were included such as Belle's mother. The musical numbers mostly remained the same, with a few alterations, including some new fresh songs to fill up the extended runtime. All the budget clearly went on producing ""Be Our Guest"" and rightly so! Consistently makes me want to dance and sing along to McGregor's false French accent. The visual effects, particularly the cursed castle items, were top notch as Lumiere and Cogsworth glisten in the warm candle light. The production and costume design were phenomenal and prevented the film from feeling like a musical stage set. Condon was able to produce a cinematic edge to the story that makes it viably enchanting for both younger and older audiences. A few issues that I had were with uninspired lines of dialogue. The script felt too artificial and was unable to inject any sort of natural characterisation. Consequently, this resulted in the actors being portrayed as cosplayers as opposed to real character actors. Watson's singing voice clearly had some modifications *cough* auto tune *cough*, especially during the opening number. I did also find she overacted everything which infuriated me, again it all comes down to this sense of fakery. I will say the supporting cast were excellent and suited their roles. Whilst this is an enjoyable magical romance, it's weighted down by a studio that was fearful of changing anything. Also an openly gay character? Right..."
"aaronnassar","2","3","4","30 March 2018"," Almost shot-for-shot exactly like the original, except sans the breathtaking animation, incredible singing, and anything else interesting for that matter.
","Wow, Disney. Can you leave ANY of your films to stand on their own, or will you eventually have tarnished your entire repertoire? I usually enjoy Emma Watson and Ewan McGregor in most of the roles they play, but even they couldn't really bring any life to this boring hunk of shit. The average ratings for this are WAAAY too high! This is nothing but a bland, uninteresting, overly-familiar and formulaic exercise in pointless retreading that isn't over nearly quick enough. The fact that so many people actually like this garbage is pretty perplexing to me. If you truly think that an uninteresting, live-action remake of an animated masterpiece somehow even holds a candle to the original, then I want whatever you're smoking! 2.3/10"

"jbrown-62886","6","3","4","12 June 2017"," So much potential yet so unfulfilling
","I REALLY wanted to love this movie. Admittedly, I love Disney. Yep, one of those wackos that braves thousands of like-minded folk stuffed into a square mile, fighting for a glimpse of Mickey as he rides by on his majestic parade float. So it's easy to see that I was anticipating this release, but with cautious optimism.<br/><br/>Sadly, some of my fears were eventually realized. Overall, the movie seems very uninspired, if I had to sum it up into one word. The characters at times seem shallow. Emma Watson, although a wonderful actress, is no Belle. Disney clearly has a vision for each of their characters and that vision is very recognizable throughout the world of Disney, in the parks, cartoons, books, etc. Watson is definitely a liberty that the producer took with this film and I personally think it was a mistake.<br/><br/>Beast is kind of a mess. I actually enjoyed the backstory but didn't feel that the movie dug deep enough into Beast's change of heart. Almost as if one day, he woke up on the other side of the bed.<br/><br/>I would have like to seen Maurice as a little more absent-minded, almost where one might think of him as potentially crazy. Here again, he seems like an afterthought. If it weren't for his hair, the name ""crazy Maurice"" wouldn't even make sense.<br/><br/>And Gaston...where do I start? I love Gaston in the story, but hated him in this movie. Gaston isn't supposed to be realized as an antagonist until midway through the story. Here, he's clearly a jerk from the start and seemingly obsessed with marriage. He's supposed to be funny, if not annoying at times. Like a puppy dog chasing a bone.<br/><br/>However, I enjoyed the music and some of the animation. And as expected, Josh Gad was a bright spot."
"mohan59","6","12","25","18 March 2017"," Visually stunning, otherwise underwhelming
","Although a film's watch-ability may not be directly implied by its Academy Award nods, there is a reason why the 1991 version became the first animated feature film ever to be nominated for the Best Picture category. That version had everything: gorgeous animation, songs of warmth and affection, tremendous voice acting, and a story that was both traditional and far-ahead of its time. We all know how Belle, well-read as she is and dissatisfied with her laid-back village life, longs for adventure. Her father, the eccentric inventor Maurice, is a kind of a bumbling simpleton at first, but is indeed a caring parent and protective of his precocious daughter, whose talents are not lost on him. A village which at once becomes a mob on the mere whim of a deeply narcissistic, insecure person. <br/><br/>With such an impression, I was hoping that the live-action version would take the film's already-legendary status even further and make it an all-time classic. Alas, I have to admit I am disappointed. There are several things in this film that were not in the animated version: the lead protagonists' backgrounds are more defined, there is a minor twist in the final act, Le Fou's predicament is more deserving of empathy than the foolish sidekick he was in 1991 are the ones that come to mind. <br/><br/>First up, the story. It stays largely faithful to the original (save for the twist I mentioned above). The humor works rather well, but is rather forced at times, leading to some awkward chemistry between the lead pair as well as between Gaston and Le Fou. In terms of progression, here is where I felt let down: Beast offering his gigantic library as a token of affection to Belle was a pivotal moment in the animated version, it made Belle realize that there is a softer side to her ferocious host. The title song also feels a bit flat; when Angela Lansbury sang with her heart, you could feel the quickening of the heartbeats, the racing of the pulses, and the irresistible magic of the moment when Belle and the Beast dance in the ballroom. As Belle finally trusts Beast by resting her head on his shoulder and the Beast is totally taken by surprise, his servants encourage him further, enhancing the timelessness of both the film and the song. Sadly, the live action has no such charm. The build-up is rushed, the song ends before you can realize what is happening, and Emma Thompson, as celebrated a thespian she is, tries her best but is unable to match Lansbury's memorable rendition. I was also disappointed to not see ""Being Human"" in this film, it was a song that demonstrated the servants' aspirations and could have served to illustrate how their lives where before the curse took effect. And with just a touch over two hours, the film's pace seems prolonged and ponderous.<br/><br/>I am not sure if the lead pair is miscast. On their own, they are pretty efficient: Emma Watson is convincing in her portrayal of a forward-thinking Belle. Dan Stevens is left to bare his soul as a tortured fiend, which he does mostly well. But its when they are together that feels a bit underwhelming. Paige O'Hara and Robby Benson's chemistry in 1991 was terrific and amazing, the former's gentle civility perfectly contrasting the latter's jarring cruelty and eventually transformed elegant nobility. It was refreshing to see Le Fou (played by the excellent Josh Gad) have a human side to him, which made his performance all the more relevant in these times. Luke Evans is equally superb, as the obnoxiously self- centered Gaston who manipulates people to his will. Kevin Kline deserves plaudits for his portrayal as well. However, I don't think Ewan McGregor was that convincing as a French candelabra, to be honest. With an odd French accent, his banter-filled exchanges with Cogsworth lack the rapier wit of Jerry Orbach-David Ogden Stiers' double team. The film does have some positives though: Le Fou's characterization, the lead pair's backstory (both mentioned above), and the stunningly exquisite production design. The detailing was intricate and dazzling, especially in the castle's interiors and Belle's ballroom gown. <br/><br/>Overall, this film works, but in hindsight, I should have watched this without much expectation. So that would be recommendation."
"luvthg","9","39","100","6 March 2017"," Emma Watson Manages to be Luminous in an Already Vibrant Film
","I'm utterly shocked by the negative backlash that this film has been getting from critics and the public because it's truly a joy to watch. Bill Condon has done a wonderful job bringing the beloved animated flick to life with a stellar cast, exceptional musical numbers, and jaw-dropping sets and visuals (the ballroom scene had me in tears). Also, Steven Chbosky and Even Spiliotopolous deserve credit as well as they were able to conceive a screenplay that kept enough familiarity with the original to give the audience some good-old nostalgia while adding enough new details and subtle elements to keep the audience invested in what's going to happen next.<br/><br/>The cast really carry the movie as well, with Luke Evans (Gaston), Dan Stevens (the Beast), and Josh Gad (LeFou) entertaining the hell out of me--Stevens is practically playing a completely different character, and his performance creates a new and charming Beast (and damn, can he sing!). Evans is absolutely perfect as Gaston, and although I don't love his singing voice for the character, he nailed every single line he was given. Now, regarding the situation with LeFou; I really don't understand why Bill Condon went ahead and made a big deal about Josh Gad's character being gay because it's barely present in the film. Beauty and the Beast is now not likely to preform as well as it could possibly have with foreign markets in addition to a bunch of local conservatives throwing temper-tantrums (spamming the film with negative ""reviews"") for nothing; you blink and you'll miss that ""exclusively gay moment"". As for Gad himself, his LeFou is charming and hilarious in his own right--he's certainly an extra viewing bonus. Kevin Kline is truly a gift to the film; he does not play a small part and he has one little song that he absolutely nails. The father-daughter bond between him and Belle is truly spectacular. As for the rest cursed objects, I thought they voiced their characters fine enough, but they weren't what was driving the film. <br/><br/>Don't let anyone tell you otherwise, this is Emma Watson's movie. And boy, does she crush it as Belle. I can assume it was tough for her to watch Emma Stone take home Best Actress for La La Land, but don't worry, Emma, because you've knocked it out of the park here. Watson's Belle is strong, independent, passionate, vigilant, and every other adjective you could add to describe the perfect modern female heroine in Disney- princess form. She is also adorably awkward at times, something understandable since she's lived as an outcast in her village her whole life. The added backstory and quirks really make this character all the more three- dimensional and they incorporate into the movie beautifully. Emma really sells every one of her scenes, and her Harry Potter days have seemed to have helped her out regarding working with visual effects and acting off of nothing. I doubt the film would be half as good if they had gotten anyone else to play Belle-- just note that about 95% of the people claiming that she was wooden in the film are either biased trolls, or more likely, people who haven't even seen the film yet.<br/><br/>As for complaints about the movie, I have very few. Personally, it took me about 10 minutes to truly get into it because it was such a strange sensation to watch my childhood be portrayed by other people, plus all of the songs felt like really weird covers of the original songs until I really warmed to the new atmosphere. Also, they would introduce fascinating details about the Beast that they never really seemed to do anything with. Lastly, the third act is somewhat a competition between the loud and over-the-top music numbers and the climatic state of the plot for your attention. Although both are extremely entertaining, at times the third act felt a little unfocused. However, I can assure you, that the ending scene were Beast transforms is spectacular, both Stevens and Watson do a terrific job expressing the same emotions created 26 years ago.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a wonderful movie. All the critics are kind of saying the same thing: ""if the original is so great, why remake it?"" and ""it's just a remake, nothing more"". Why does this film not deserve credit for being a faithful yet fresh retelling of the tale as old as time? In fact, it even improves upon some aspects of the original, such as how Belle and Beast fall in love (just wait a couple weeks and see the film and you'll understand how). I have the answer: people simply don't want to like this movie. The original is so amazing and beloved by practically the entire planet that Disney having the audacity to come and revamp so many people's childhoods for the sake of money is, for many, very offensive--even if the movie's actually really, really good."

","If 2015's ""Cinderella"" represents the live-action potential for Disney's animated classics, then 2017's ""Beauty and the Beast"" shows all its limitations and drawbacks. Much of the plot stays true to the 1991 animated classic, which is charming for the first few minutes but rapidly wears thin, while its modernized inserts are negligible at best. The special effects often look cartoonish, which underscores the movie's point, and manages to make the original's standout moments, like ""Be My Guest"" and ""Kill the Beast,"" feel redundant and underwhelming. Ewan McGregor, who voices Lumiere, seems to be acting in a different, much more enchanting movie, and his obvious enthusiasm highlights how much of it is lacking elsewhere."
"terlgerl","2","4","6","18 January 2018"," Magic Lost, Agenda Pushed
","Many others have covered Emma Watson's wooden performance and the stereotypical characters. 
As someone who grew up with, and loved, the 1991 film- I found this to be a huge disappointment. Instead of building on the original, they pushed an agenda. Every other villager was black (really, in the 18th century French countryside?), Belle is a feminist, Lefou is gay, and there was multiple inferences to content inappropriate for kids. At one point three men get ""attacked' by the wardrobe and end up in garish, drag-like female apparel. One of the guys breaks out in a huge grin which is a not even remotely subtle promotion of transgenderism. My 9 year old asked about his strange reaction. Why is this crap in a kids movie? 
The new songs were lame. I wanted to fast forward through them. Especially the ""Beast Ballad"". 
The worst thing though is that this movie has no magical quality too it at all. Even the ballroom scene was sadly disappointing and flat. All those talented actors, no doubt a huge budget, the freakin' story already written and they manage to mess it up."
"gjw","5","4","6","8 July 2017"," Stick with the original animated version
","The moral of this film should be: if you've done it right in the first place, don't remake it.<br/><br/>The original animated movie was an all-time classic, with great music and fine animation. There was no need to remake it, other than that the Disney corporation is raking in billions turning all of their animated classics into mostly mediocre live-action pics.<br/><br/>It's impossible to watch this new version without comparing it to the animated original, especially since it's basically the same movie, including the songs, simply re-done scene-by-scene as live- action. And alas, the new version pales by comparison at every turn. <br/><br/>It turns out that not everything in an animated film translates well when rendered in more realistic CGI. The Beast's living furniture, for instance, which is charming in the original animated form, comes across as rather alien & creepy in CGI. And so does the Beast. We're used to seeing walking, talking animals in cartoons, but seen in life-like CGI, it forces the viewer to confront the reality of what it would be like for a human girl to actually get physically involved with what is basically a large, standing animal with horns. They even messed with music, adding at least two mediocre new songs in place of the wonderful music from the original version. Why?<br/><br/>It isn't a terrible movie, and it has its moments, I suppose, but it simply has no reason to exist, other than to be compared unfavorably to the original. And to make money.<br/><br/>The film made $175 on its opening weekend, before the built-in audience even knew what they were getting themselves into, and the movie wound up grossing half a billion in the U.S. alone. So you can bet that Disney will keep cranking out these inferior, live-action versions, whether they're artistic failures or not."
"andrewromero-54571","7","4","6","22 April 2017"," Great movie with one missed opportunity.
","I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and found myself completely engaged at times as if I was with the characters. I was sadly disappointed however with Emma Watson's singing. Perhaps I might not have noticed it as much if I hadn't been told before hand, but her singing really was not as powerful or moving as it could have been with a stronger singer. Some of the songs of this movie are my very favorite in all of Disney, and it just didn't deliver. Here's to hoping that Disney will put out a version dubbing her singing voice. George Clooney did it in ""Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?"" and I don't think any less of him, and it was still a great movie.<br/><br/>The following contains spoilers:<br/><br/>I do want to say I absolutely loved the castle. I appreciated the explanation about how the curse worked, as well as how Agatha was there to take it away. The dinner scene was very fun. Luke Evans and Josh Gad also did a very good job."

","I just want to say that if people like Emma Waston, that's fine but if you're a huge fan of hers, I suggest you don't read this review.<br/><br/>Now I love the original animated Beauty and the Beast so I knew this movie wouldn't live up to the original. With that being said, this new movie does have some merits. The CGI in this movie is rather good and the scenery is beautiful. I also love what they did with the castle. In a way, the castle feels alive too and I thought that was a great twist. The costumes are also really gorgeous. <br/><br/>As for acting, everyone delivers a great performance save for one actress who I'll get to in a minute. Luke Evans was stellar as Gaston. You can tell he was enjoying himself and was amazing. Josh Gad of course was funny as always. Ewan McGregor did a rather good job as Lumiere and Ian McKellan was a pretty decent Cogsworth. You also have Stanley Tucci, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Audra McDonald and Emma Thompson also giving it their all. Now as for the Beast, he was decent. I haven't seen Dan Stevens in anything but this and I thought he did an okay job. He could have been better but I thought he was fine.<br/><br/>But the worst part of this movie is Emma Watson.<br/><br/>Again, if you like Emma that is fine but she was not the right choice of Belle. Not only do they not even try to make her look like Belle but she doesn't feel like Belle. She tries to deliver classic Belle lines but it sounds like she doesn't trust the lines. She feels so awkward and stiff. Every line feels beyond forced and nothing about it feels organic. And the biggest issue is her singing voice. I know Emma isn't a trained singer but even so, that doesn't really change the fact that she cannot hold a tune. She's boring, bland and just all around dull.<br/><br/>If you are dying to see this movie, I say go for it but I really think you're better waiting for the DVD."

","1991's 'Beauty and the Beast' is not just my favourite animated film, speaking as a huge animation fan and who loves most of Disney's films, but also one of my favourite films.<br/><br/>Expectations were very much mixed going to see this live-action retelling, having thoroughly enjoyed 2015's 'Cinderella' and 2016's 'The Jungle Book' (which were visually gorgeous and combined old and new while retaining the spirits of their animated counterparts). Also being familiar with Bill Condon's previous work, and finding him a generally promising director and writer. 'Gods and Monsters' is amazing and one of my favourites, 'Kinsey' was interesting and 'Dreamgirls' was elevated by the soundtrack and the cast was quite decent, before he dropped the ball with the last two 'Twilight' films which were not good films at all through no real fault of Condon but with a good deal of everything else.<br/><br/>At the same time, some of the casting was dubious (Emma Watson is not as bad an actress as many say but to me she just wasn't my idea of Belle, though the likes of Ian McKellen and Emma Thompson promised a lot) and considering that the 1991 film is such a masterpiece in every area (to me the animated 'Cinderella' and 'The Jungle Book' are great films but nothing compared to 'Beauty and the Beast') comparisons were always going to be inevitable. Not comparing was always going to be hard when it was such a staple of my, and many others', childhood. Really questioned the point of it too. Seeing it for myself with no prejudice, and writing this review reading as few reviews as possible, this retelling is not a patch on the 1991 film, it doesn't disgrace it but what worked so well before is missing. On its own terms, it's also very problematic. Just for the record, in no way is it awful, but my feelings were exactly the same as initial expectations, mixed.<br/><br/>Starting with the great things, most of 'Beauty and the Beast' (2017) looks amazing. The set design is colourful and incredibly lavish, with equally gorgeous costumes (especially Belle's yellow ball gown which is even nicer than the dress Watson wore in 'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire') and everything is exquisitely photographed. The original songs, some of Disney's finest ever, from the 1991 film are maintained, and as masterful as ever, while the instrumental score is rousing, layered and beautiful.<br/><br/>Of the renditions of the songs, the best one is the Busby Berkeley-inspired jaw-dropping extravaganza ""Be Our Guest"". ""Gaston"" is also enormous fun, and hurrah for one of the best song lyrics ever being kept ""I use antlers in all my decorating"" and while Thompson's performance of ""Beauty and the Beast"" is nothing compared to the iconic one of Angela Lansbury in one of the greatest scenes in all animation it is still poignant.<br/><br/>The supporting cast do fare better than the leads, with Luke Evans being the standout, performing Gaston with gusto and menace. Josh Gad is great fun as LeFou, and regarding the controversy for me it has been blown out of proportion and nowhere near as explicit as seemingly implied, it's actually pretty subtle and will go over the heads of younger audiences. Ewan McGregor is clearly enjoying himself as Lumiere, despite sporting a dodgy accent (though a French accent is not easy), while McKellen is a wonderfully stuffy Cogsworth, Stanley Tucci is a great addition and Thompson a sincere Mrs Potts. Chip is very cute too, and Lumiere and Plumette's chemistry is sweet and amusing without being creepy.<br/><br/>However, am of the opinion that Watson and Dan Stevens are miscast. Watson is far too earnest for Belle and a lot of her line delivery is both forced and phoned in. Stevens often looks stiff and uncomfortable as Beast, being very cheaply made up, and his eyes look dead. Beast was a fascinating character before but has been stripped of his complexity and soul. The chemistry between them, something that would have made or broken the film, isn't there. Audra MacDonald overdoes it in the role of the wardrobe and Kevin Kline tries his best but his Maurice is largely wasted.<br/><br/>Special effects and such are a mixed bag. Some of it fares well but some of it looks pretty dreadful, especially Chip, the wolves and Beast. One admires the fact that 'Beauty and the Beast' tries to remain faithful to the animated film, but one can't help feeling that it was too faithful and that the spirit generally was lost in translation. There is not much new, though trying with additional songs that are so lacking compared to the original songs (""Evermore"" is forgettable and completely lacks impact) and cramming in numerous back-stories that mostly bloats the film and like a rich pudding being over-egged. Belle and Maurice's subplot feels like padding and eats up too much time.<br/><br/>Not all the original song renditions work, with ""Belle"" lacking joy and being pedestrian in staging, ""Something There"" being similarly indifferent and underpowered in singing. The climax, so powerful before with a tense final fight and Beast's death scene and transformation even now reducing me to floods of tears every time, this time round feels like a lukewarm anti-climax. The beautifully crafted script before is both dull and overdone here, the story lacks magic, joy, charm, soul and emotional power that only appears sporadically and the pacing suffers from the film trying to do too much.<br/><br/>In summary, 'Beauty and the Beast' (2017) looks gorgeous with a strong supporting cast and a few song renditions that come off well but suffers from being over-stuffed, miscast leads and feeling very bland in spirit. 5/10 Bethany Cox"

"AndiRobinson","10","17","39","18 March 2017"," Finally a Disney remake that is worthy of Disney
","I must confess that I am a huge Disney fan. I love the movies, well most of them. I love visiting Disneyland regardless of whether its Paris or Florida (Can't comment on the others as I haven't been to them but I imagine that they are magical too). But one thing that I have been critical of with Disney in recent years. Is the lack of imagination. <br/><br/>Disney seem insistent on ruining the memories of my childhood by remaking all of their animated classics in to ""real world"" movies. With the exception of Maleficent which gave the tale of Sleeping Beauty a new twist, I have been bitterly disappointed with the remakes. This was topped by the appalling Jungle Book. <br/><br/>Yet I was excited about the remake of Beauty and the Beast, while also extremely apprehensive. The original is a classic and all of the hype surrounding this film couldn't make me help but feel 2 things. First that I might be in danger of seeing the film in the trailers that when it gets to the movie that I will have seen it. The second was too many details were being released regarding it, such as it having a gay character and the first interracial kiss. Why should these things make headlines? However I went into the movie still excited about what Disney had done with it.<br/><br/>I watched the movie in 3D and there was a few things that came out of the screen but seeing it in 2D wouldn't have changed the viewing pleasure. <br/><br/>What Disney have done with this film, is set the bar so high for future remakes, that I don't think they will beat it. They treated the original respect, yet brought this movie up to date. The new songs that were introduced were beautiful and ""Evermore"" brought me to tears in the cinema. The hype surrounding around a gay character wasn't justified it was very subtle and tasteful that unless you was looking out for it I am not sure you would have noticed. <br/><br/>The story also had a few little additions but this all added to the film rather then subtracted it. In fact I would go as far as to say that it made the characters and the story more believable. I left the cinema wanting to go back and see it again. This film was that good. <br/><br/>The only criticism I would make is the sound mixing could have been better. There was a clear difference int he sound between when the actors were speaking and then the rerecording of their singing. The singing wasn't bad at all but it was slightly distracting. My concern that Ewan McGregors annoying french accent would grate on me for the whole film slowly disappeared as the film progressed. Must confess that I did think Mrs Potts was played by Helana Bonham-Carter but it was in fact played by Emma Thompson. <br/><br/>In summary the film was everything I hoped Disney would make and lived up to the magic that I expected. I have no problems recommending this film and giving it 10/10"
"DrDarkness","3","7","13","20 May 2017"," Tale as old as time - and still you can screw it up.
","First I'll explain the 4/10 stars; an attempt was made with this movie. I could see the effort, but even if you make a cake and it looks pretty it doesn't matter if it doesn't taste like anything.<br/><br/>So yeah, I'm one of those who got disappointed with this remake. I had read the reviews and seen the trailers, so I somewhat knew what I was stepping in to when I went to see this.<br/><br/>I'm very much with the audience that has already stated the obvious; Emma Watson is lovely lady, but she's no Belle. I get that the writers wanted her to have some spunk in her rather than just be a bland miss goody-two-shoes, but Watson can't play it through. Just in one or two scenes she looks like she's about to grasp her role, other times she looks like she's just reading her lines out loud to her grandma. But it's not all her fault, the pointing finger goes almost entirely on casting and the director. I mean - what's with the awkward scenes? When the Beast is fighting off Gaston, the camera suddenly shows Emma gasping very theatrically. Like someone just shouts at her ""Okay Emma, now gasp like you're in a school play and you have to make it show all the way to the back row"" - which she does, and it just looks silly.<br/><br/>I mean.. There's so much wrong in a movie that should've been the best thing come out from Disney in ages. from start to finish this movie was pain to watch. All the awkward ball scenes in the beginning and end, well, at least the movie got to finish at the same dull feeling as it started.<br/><br/>There were good things, too. Like the design of the castle. Dan Stevens singing his piece, which was nicely put together even though it wasn't a part of the original animation. The movie showed the Beasts' pain far better than animated version. We get to see the more dark side of Gaston's personality.<br/><br/>I will never watch this again, this I will assure you. I'm sorry, Sir Ian McKellen, but even you couldn't save this movie - as magnificent as you are."
"ahmedzahran","4","7","13","23 April 2017"," Much inferior to the cartoon version
","If you watched the original cartoon version then you don't want to watch this one. All the characters, literally, are a washed down version of the cartoon ones. It gets super boring when you realize the script is almost 98% the same, despite hoping to see anything new and fresh, or thought provoking (only a single one of these for me in the whole movie). Feels more like a musical, which if I knew I wouldn't have gone to watch it. Real disappointment. Time wasted, ticket money lost."
"Igenlode Wordsmith","5","7","13","31 March 2017"," Tries too hard
","Just went to see Disney's latest ""Beauty and the Beast"", which was recommended by everyone from the conductor at our last orchestra rehearsal to the greengrocer, and was very disappointed :-(<br/><br/>Most of the film ranged from mediocre to downright annoying -- I don't know how I would have reacted if I hadn't been mentally comparing it to the animated version of which this was an adaptation, but in comparison with its predecessor I felt it came off very badly. The opening scene wasn't too bad as a fleshed-out live-action version of something that was heavily stylised in the first place, but as soon as we got to ""Bonjour!"" my heart sank. The busy town scene that was so full of life in its caricatured version was neither realistic nor convincingly stylised. Emma Watson in her liberated modern costumes looked completely out of place (which was only emphasised by the screenplay's attempts to explain this away by telling us that she was ahead of her time), and I felt that an air of nastiness had crept in to both sides of the equation. Belle doesn't just find her home provincial, she scorns it as oppressive; her neighbours don't just see her as a dreamy odd girl, they see her as a dangerous subversive. The days of fairy-tale are over; this film comes across as trying to sell a message -- pump a brand -- create 'Disney princess' material (with all its post-'Frozen' overlays of girl power and empowerment) -- in a way that the original never did.<br/><br/>I remember that sequence where Belle runs out onto the streaming grass of the hill-top and sings of her longing for ""the great wide somewhere"" away from the cheerful, well-meaning domestic preoccupations of her neighbours as being the great 'lift-off' moment of the animated version; it spoke to everything that I was and everything I hoped for. Here -- not at all aided by the obvious fake 'reality' of the flowers and scenery -- the presentation of it felt thoroughly manipulative and left me unmoved and resentful; that was the moment at which it first began to dawn on me that I might actually come to dislike this version :-(<br/><br/>Feminist Belle turns out to be... inadvertently annoying. Quite a lot of things about this film were annoying, not least its habit of trying far too hard to patch perceived plot holes and deficiencies in its characters by adding vast amounts of laboured backstory. (All that we really needed to know about Belle's missing mother, for instance, was conveyed in the single silent shot of her father at work beneath the painting of his wife and child.) ""Tries far too hard"" sums it up, really.<br/><br/>The one plot issue that I did feel needed addressing in the original was the improbable timescale of the idea that the Prince had to break the spell before his twenty-first birthday -- instead of trying to explain this one away, very wisely they silently drop the reference. And the additions I enjoyed were the added characters of the musical wardrobe and piano, plus the idea that the characters are not merely doomed to remain cursed, but will become items of furniture for real if it goes on too long. (Although having a lengthy would-be weepy sequence at the end where not only does the Beast actually die -- before being resurrected by the Dea ex Machina -- but all the other characters effectively perish, as well, was a case of over-egging the pudding, which this film does all too often.)<br/><br/>Cogsworth very much seems to get the thin end of the stick in this version, I felt -- in the original, I remember him as a by-the-book stickler of an English butler figure, but with unsuspected moments of dignity and heroism. Here he's basically the cowardly comic relief who is always on the wrong side of every disagreement, and the ending is soured with yet another laugh at his expense when he is restored to the arms of his unpleasant wife.<br/><br/>And while most people who disliked the film seemed to mention the character of Gaston as its one saving grace, I disliked Gaston as well... and not in the enjoyable way you were meant to dislike him :-( The original is handsome, conceited, talented in his own sphere, genuinely convinced that he is the best thing ever to happen to Belle and quite unable to understand why she can't see it. This version, who deliberately kicks mud over the girls who admire him and often seems to need talking down from a psychotic fit, comes across as rather less blindly self-centred and more coldly narcissistic. The original Gaston genuinely didn't seem to understand this unprecedented failure of his charms; this one is a sadist who actively prefers hunting down reluctant 'prey'. In trying (I think) to give him more psychological depth, they've removed the casual swagger of the original and the necessary charisma that would explain why people follow and adore him; he becomes simply nasty from the start.<br/><br/>I had no particular objection to Disney's live-action remake of their ""Cinderella"", possibly because I barely even knew the original; I saw the remake and quite liked it. With this one they took on the much more risky task of remaking something that was a hit in its own right to begin with, thus giving themselves a much higher bar to pass. (There's an aphorism that it takes a bad book to make a great movie -- something similar may apply to remakes...) The constant over-the-top urge to provide explanations and reinterpretations for every detail of the original by and large just doesn't work."

","I was literally expecting to come on here to see at least an 8/10 and more positive comments but I'm not surprised because many people on here do have the tendency to bash great movies. BUT WOW, Disney went above & beyond for this movie. At first, even I was skeptical about Emma playing Belle, I'm so used to her being Hermione but she played the part perfectly. It was Magical, wonderful, the effects and details were more specific, antique yet ""royal"" looking. It reminded me so much of the original film yet much BETTER. This is one movie I'm definitely going back to the theaters to watch again soon. But please, if you're a complicated person, please do not go watch the movie knowing very well you're going to come back on here just to make the ratings lower. I see people complaining that is was too much like the original and others saying it wasn't enough like the older version. None of them will ever be pleased, not even with an 160 million$ budget. Disney, it was AMAZING and I definitely can't wait for our Florida trip next weekend to visit the Be Our Guest Restaurant. I never do movie reviews but for this movie, well it definitely seems like it needs more positive people on here.

Exceptional cast, more fleshed-out than the original while still staying true to the story, and even more magical. I couldn't look away the whole time.

"asifahsankhan","7","14","32","13 March 2017"," Happily, gone wrong it has NOT! (Well. . . Kinda')
","Imagine if Disney announced a new live action remake of Fantasia and decided to keep Mickey Mouse in it. Try to envision how the photo- realistic CGI might look. Not a hand-drawn Mickey swanning around with a bucket-carrying broomstick, but an actual mouse the size of a person wearing a sorcerer's costume and walking on its hind legs. Also a broomstick that has arms and hands and walks on its, er, hind straw.<br/><br/>Would this hybrid human-rodent and its transmogrified cleaning tool look just as magical in live action as they did in the 1940 classic? You wouldn't bet your house on it; the mental image required to picture such a visualisation is weird and preposterous. If Big Mouse executives decided to give the project a go-ahead one question would linger at the core of it: why bother?<br/><br/>And so now, you think this film will end up as Disney's revamped and bizarrely note-for-note ""Beauty and the Beast"" just as American filmmaker Gus van Sant treated British Cinema, Sir Alfred Hitchcock and his sacred thriller ""Psycho"" as if it were a blueprint for his much maligned shot-by-shot pathetic 1998 remake.<br/><br/>Condon's movie may not have a giant rodent or personified straw broom, but there are comparable alternatives – from the titular bear/boar/buffalo-like creature to a range of magical household things, including singing and dancing furniture. There are times when it will certainly seem not conformable; but not in fact enough to make anybody come out of the cinema with a firm belief that talking teacups belong only in cartoons or acid trips. In fact, those who predicted this wouldn't hold a talking candle to the animated original are in for a bit of a pickle and will be pleasantly surprised. The tale may be as old as time, but it's retold with freshness, charm and flair.<br/><br/>Happily, gone wrong it has not. (Well. . . Kinda')<br/><br/>There are a few minor fumbles, but you're likely to walk away with a lightened step, a broad smile and at least one song-worm in your ear.<br/><br/>The story remains rock solid: essentially a sweet two-hand-er (well, one hand, one paw) in which two bookworms fall in love, helped along by an assortment of sentient household items. Everything hangs upon the casting of those two roles, but Condon has picked his leads well. Dan Stevens appears in human form during a new prologue, in which his vain prince is coped-up, caked in David Bowie eye make-up and surrounded by simpering female admirers, before an enchantress appears and zaps him with a frankly unreasonable curse. From then on, he's in full Beast mode, with a sub-woofer voice and giant horns, resembling the cooler, better-dressed brother of the Faun from Pan's Labyrinth. The CGI used to purify furry Stevens is variable in quality, but as Beast storms around his dank keep's exquisitely designed turrets, the performance is consistently strong. As much as he bellows, the wounded soul beneath the bombast is always clear.<br/><br/>As for Beauty, Emma Watson immediately charms in her big opening number, in which the heroine suffers a village-worth's of idiots sharing (what should be) their inner monologues through song. Watson faces one difficult sequence after another — memorable vocalised songs, tussles with talking wardrobes, emotional exchanges with a grouchy Heffalump — but finds just the right combination of innocence and grit. Plus, she doesn't sound like Fran Drescher, which is an immediate advantage. <br/><br/>Emma Watson is as wonderful as she is, tough, lionhearted character, rich in self-confidence and sass, with an inspiring disdain for the many injustices of a cruel patriarchal world.<br/><br/>Condon's set pieces are old school, picture book, rococo, on-the- studio-lot style edifices, appealing in a very decent and honestly a cartoon lover sort of way. Works for a lot of you, kids!"

"bmav","4","6","11","27 July 2017"," Two Words: Bad Pacing
","When I saw the first trailer for this film, I was THRILLED. The 1991 Beauty and the Beast is my favorite animated Disney film and I like it even more now than I did when I was a child. However, Disney is not infallible like everyone thinks they are. I watched the new adaptation for the first time last night, and I was utterly disappointed. <br/><br/>The new film lacked the drama, passion, and magic that the first film presented. Though the visuals of the film were gorgeous, it was over-acted, and contained changes that just didn't make much sense for the story. Its largest flaw, however, was its pacing.<br/><br/>The 1991 film does a marvelous job taking its time to create feelings of excitement, mystery, and urgency in a scene. For example, the first time the Beast is revealed there is a dark and mysterious weight present. This mood is built slowly and carefully until the full reveal of the Beast when Belle asks him to step into the light, where the audience can share the shock that belle experiences. <br/><br/>In the new version, this scene is rushed to the point that the drama and weight are completely lost. Beast is revealed in an awkward daytime scene that feels managed, unnatural, unimportant, and unremarkable. Another scene that shares this issue (though most of them do) is where Belle ventures into the forbidden West Wing. In the 1991 version, she slowly and cautiously makes her way there, allowing the audience to feel the tension. We are shown tattered paintings and crumbled statues, then finally the wilting rose. What a powerful scene! In the new version, however, Belle literally runs up the stairs, finds the rose, is yelled at by Beast and exits again in what seemed like less than 30 seconds. The whole movie feels rushed in this way, like the director had to hurry through the old material so he could add a bunch of new material to the film and still keep the run time down for mainstream audiences. This equation will ALWAYS create a sub-par film.<br/><br/>On a positive note, however, the song ""Be Our Guest"" was brilliantly portrayed, and Gaston was a surprisingly entertaining character to watch. <br/><br/>Overall, however, I did not enjoy this movie. This story needed a film that took its time to tell the story right. Sadly, it just didn't happen this time."
"Tv_MovieSnob","1","6","11","21 June 2017"," Yes We Wanted This BUT We Didn't WANT THIS!
","I can't even put into words how disappointed I was about this movie, I knew it was going to be disappointed when I first seen the previews the CGI was jaw dropping and I don't mean that in a good way and the fact that Emma Watson was cast to play the lovely Belle was laughable but still I had hope because Beauty and the Beast is by far my favorite Disney Movie, it's in my top 5. The main issue I had with this film aside from the casting was the story tale itself. Disney for some reason decided to combined the old Folklore with their Disney version of how the beast became the beast and it truly made no sense because they left out key details in both. <br/><br/>Some Backstory: In the old Folklore of Beauty and the Beast, Belle's father was a merchant who had 3 sons and 3 daughters the youngest being Belle, Belle was loved by her brothers and her father but her two sisters despised her. One day the merchant asked his girls what they wanted him to bring back the two sisters said money and jewelry but Belle only requested a single Rose. Which brings us to how the father met the beast just like in the movie the beast kept himself hidden and he fed the father and let him relax in his chair and rest and as the father was leaving he noticed the rose garden remembered Belle's request and picked off a rose which enraged the beast and so he showed himself and basically told the father that he was taking advantage of his kindness which is why he became the beasts prisoner but he did allow him to go home to say goodbye to his family which brings us to how Belle decided to trade places with her father which imprisoned him in the place the brothers and the fathers profusely rejected the idea and were actually going to slay the beast but Belle wouldn't allow them to do that and instead took her fathers place which made the brothers and father sad but the sisters were thrilled. The beast and Belle got along quite fine and developed trust and love for each other and he actually allowed her to go back home to see her family as long as she wasn't gone more than 3 days, well leave it to the bitter sisters to put a stop to this because they wanted Belle dead/ locked away with the beast so they convinced Belle to stay longer hoping that this would set the beast off it took a bit of persuading and Belle stayed for a week and the beast grew weak and Belle could sense that something was wrong so she rushed back to the beast who was basically dying and she was crying over him and professing her love, she kisses him and the beast turns into a prince they get married the brothers and father rejoice and the evil bitter sisters well Belle turns them into the stone - The End.<br/><br/>That's how the Folklore goes so as you can see aside from a few key parts Disney took bits and pieces and meshed it up with the animated tale and they added a whole new element which was Belle's mother and the magic book that takes them to any point and time in the world which was just stupid and unnecessary, we could all assume that Belle's mother was dead we didn't need to know what she died of anyone could've guessed small pox or even chlamydia I mean hello they didn't have medicine people were dying from the common cold for Christ sake it was just stupid and nobody cares! This live action remake was absolutely dreadful and who was the ugly dude that played the part of Gaston? What about him was rugged or handsome he looked like a prissy prep school boy if you ask me! Even the enchanted castle and characters were lackluster in this remake it was all around disappointing and they added new songs that nobody knew who does that?! So in the end I'm sure people will watch but as a true fan of beauty and the beast both folklore and animation this live action remake was a let down in a big way."

(because of too many mushrooms and weed smoked) even the mighty Disney empire has been plagued by mediocre and sub-mediocre unintelligent people who decided to put their few neurons to work - and created this utter nonsensical useless boring dull uninspired (and very much expired) piece of sh**. So they chose an actress who had relations up there - because this is how things often worked in Hollywood - but in spite of their efforts to auto-tune her voice and dress her in colorful stuff, she still damaged the image of the original Belle of Disney. A broomstick up her a$$, her reactions were so much more unemotional than those of the petrified castle servants... & the beast? absolutely horrendous to watch, also pretty much wooden... and an insult to the original cartoon of 1991 <br/><br/>WHO STILL REMAINS ONE OF DISNEY'S MASTERPIECES<br/><br/>(from a time when the minds and hearts of people making movies there were less affected by darkness).<br/><br/>It's best to revisit the old masterpieces. I am afraid of how the future rehashes will look..."

","Whenever something animated does well some douche always thinks a live action will perform equally well. This is just as bad as the attack on titan live action movie.

"AlsExGal","7","6","11","5 April 2017"," A remake that was well done
","As much as it pains me to see movies being remade, I find that I am able to give Disney a pass for this. I thoroughly enjoyed Beauty and the Beast . I have been a fan of Emma Watson's, since first watching the ""Harry Potter"" series several years ago. It is evident she is not a strong singer, but her singing was pleasant enough. I think I doubted Disney's decision to cast her as Belle, but after seeing the movie, I feel as if those doubts have been put to rest.<br/><br/>I also thought the rest of the casting was well done. Dan Stevens of Downton Abbey fame was great as The Beast (in this version, he even gets to sing a song) and Kevin Kline was great as Maurice, Belle's father. Emma Thompson never fails to impress me. She was one of the people I was extremely glad was cast in this film. She did Angela Lansbury proud. Josh Gad (Lefou) is perhaps most famous for portraying the lovable snowman, Olaf, in Disney's 2013 animated film, ""Frozen"" (although I knew him mainly from the raunchy Broadway show, ""Book of Mormon,"" but that's a story for another time). Luke Evans (Gaston): I am not as familiar with him; the only film of his I've seen is ""Dracula: Untold."" He was pretty good as well. Ian McKellen and Ewan McGregor were wonderful as usual. The one I was impressed with the most, was 6-time Tony winner Audra McDonald. I have been a fan of hers since the year 2000 when I first watched Disney's ""Annie"", and she never fails to amaze me with her consistency and overall talent. Her voice was, by far, the best in the movie.<br/><br/>The cinematography and special effects were obviously all there. When you get a huge company like Disney behind a product, they naturally have all the money and the resources available to make the best quality motion picture in the technical aspects that they want.<br/><br/>Give this movie a try, it was truly beautiful."
"mankhan67","1","8","16","22 May 2017"," Total Disappointment
","I had the chance to see this movie with my daughter who is now married. I saw the really Disney animation with her while raising her may be a 100 times and we went to cinema with great hopes but came out of cinema with utmost disappointment. After all the best technology and available CGs, the movie did not have any grip to the real spirit of the animation made many years ago. I wish we would not have seen the movie and instead would have gone home and would have seen animation on my home theater."
"yonatanrediet","3","9","19","20 March 2017"," Unexpected scene
","To be honest, it didn't bother me at all that they've tried to make the exact...well.. almost exact copy of the Disney's Masterpiece:""Beauty and the Beast"". I was eager to watch it with my kids (thinking it was a family movie!), but to my surprise, there was GAY SCENES!!!! I 100 percent prefer the animated one/<br/><br/>Due to that, i couldn't enjoy the movie and shouldn't be categorized with family movies."
"larrymeers","6","9","19","19 March 2017"," An exact copy of the classic original
","Ever since Disney made a live action remake of the jungle book, they have been making remakes of our childhood films,and hope to continue doing that. And then you have this movie. We all know the story, A beautiful girl stumbles across a castle with talking house hold items and a beast, but soon enough they grow to love each other. I really liked all the people in this movie, they did a good job at playing their roles, whether they were a mild mannered tea cup, or a hairy creature. The special effects were good, and most of the musical numbers were great. However all the people and the music does not make up for the same exact story as the animated classic. I enjoyed The Jungle Book and Pete's Dragon because all though they had some of the same elements, they boosted enough new elements and a new plot to keep the story going. While this movie doesn't do that at all. I expected some things do be different but it gave me the same characters, same plot, and mostly the same musical numbers. Hell they even had the same dialogue. So in the end, Beauty and the Beast may have some enjoyable moments, but that is not enough to keep us engaged when all it is an exact copy of the classic original. C- or 5/10. Face it the only reason they made this film was to put more money into Disney's pockets."
"glitterflame89","10","14","33","17 March 2017"," Exquisite Adaptation
","Disney really got one right in this case. The artistry is beautiful, the acting and casting is impeccable, and Disney was able to hit the important social lessons with just the right balance without being heavy-handed. It does the original animated film justice while adding more dimension to the story and further fleshing out the characters, ultimately without changing important details of the original. The music was also handled perfectly, adding new songs with the same flavor as the original while not remixing the original songs into awful parodies of themselves. This is the only film I have ever attended that got two rounds of applause after it ended. It is worth seeing on its own merit, and is also a fun nostalgic walk down memory lane for those of us who were young when the original came out (and the movie knows it, and gives more than a couple subtle nods to this)."
"madinehart","10","14","33","17 March 2017"," Amazing!
","I thought the movie was very well done. I agree, Gaston was my favorite. He did a great job. As for the gay under tone.....whatever! Most movies have it. It was so subtle you really had to look for it. Similar to but less than Sweet Home Alabama. Think about this...if Olaf wasn't a snowman in Frozen it would have been the same here. No big deal! Emma Watson was a fantastic choice for Belle. I thought it impossible to break the Hermione character and she impressed me!! The perfect Belle!! The only bad I can say....Beasts solo??? There was a point but eh???? I didn't care for it. Some graphics in later scenes looked fake and that is the only bad I can say!! Loved this movie and going back Sunday to see it again!!!"
"house_elf_cutie","10","15","36","17 March 2017"," Excellent Film and Must See!
","Don't be discouraged by what other people have said about this movie being bad. If you want to see exactly the original film, then by all means, do not watch this movie. However, if you want to see a story that is close to the original but added a little more layers, some tweaks every now and then, of course then, I highly recommend this movie. Some people spoke about the CGI on the beast, but I still think they did an overall fantastic job and it didn't bother me one bit. I love Emma Watson. Her acting towards the end got kind of iffy, but she did her part adequately. Dan Stevens is just as charming as ever, especially as the beast. Luke Evans takes the cake for acting as Gaston but BEING Gaston, which made me think the role was best suited for him. I love this adaptation and I will definitely see it again."
"Phantomonum","10","15","36","17 March 2017"," Animated movie flawlessly incarnated on the big screen!
","First of all I want to say that the Beauty and the beast is one of my favorite Disney animated movies and I don't know how many times I have watched it as a kid.<br/><br/>So, that being said, I may sound a little bias when I say that it is the best Disney animated movie adaptation I have ever seen! This is the animated movie flawlessly incarnated on the big screen.<br/><br/>-Both stage and voice acting was good. Emma and Luke did a good job of leading heroine and villain. I also really enjoyed Ewan McGregor's LumiÃ¨re.<br/><br/>-Art director and designers did an amazing job of masterfully bringing the animated world to life.<br/><br/>-And what Choreographers did was incredible! Those dance and song scenes, combined with the set design... I am lost for words!<br/><br/>-Pacing and story is exactly as it was in the original animated movie, with a couple of new scenes where director took the liberty of saying a few words of his own, to leave his mark. But nothing much that would affect the main story, on the contrary it adds to it.<br/><br/>-Lots of people complained about cgi, but believe me it is NOT bad. Sure there were couple of iffy moments, but overall it was done beautifully. I'd prefer cgi Beast to Edward 2.0 and Edward 3.0 any day!<br/><br/>I apologize if the review is so overly positive, but I couldn't help myself when I loved every moment of it. So here is the bottom line, If you loved the Disney animated movie, I guarantee you're gonna love this, because it is basically the same, the story, the songs, the characters... Everything! The only difference you'll see is that it looks more real. I basically sat though the whole movie with a dumb smile on my face. If you haven't seen the animated movie before, you'll 'probably' still gonna love it, as one of my friends who didn't know about it, really loved it! and if for some reason you didn't like the original, i don't know, you'll probably still not gonna like it..?<br/><br/>Anyway, If people do say bad stuff about it do not listen, just go and see for yourself, you won't regret it!"
"rgkarim","8","16","39","16 March 2017"," Visuals Are a Beauty, The Charm Is A Bit More Beast
","It's finally here, the live action telling of a beloved story that Disney made memorable years ago. Yes, I'm talking about Beauty and The Beast my friends, and tonight I'm here to share my thoughts. Now let's get this laid down now, I'm going to look at it as its own movie and do my best to minimize the masterpiece. So please don't cast aside the review if I tread on any ground. With that said, let's get started to see if the modern retelling has what it takes to stand out in the world. <br/><br/>Summary: You may hear others say the movie is spot on with the 1991 telling. Not entirely true, but this rendition keeps about 80% of the Tale as Old as Time to please the classic fans, while adding some tangents to give it a twist. To quote a friend, ""the new spins are built around the fans from the 90s generation to entertain"". It works for the most part, adding depth to the characters and giving the emotional kick older audience members will appreciate. And while sticking to the story is good start, the next magical step is how well they brought it to life in the visuals. Beauty and The Beasts charming country side and castles, are brought out in spectacular detail via breathtaking scenery shots and detail oriented settings that are worthy of recognition. Next dress our characters in wonderful costumes fitting of the landscape, with special emphasis on the traditional Belle Dress and Beast coat that remains timeless, and you again get more magic. Finally add in the animation, realistic, fluid, and somewhat mirroring the classic style most fell in love with, and you have a great combination. Of note, there are times when things get trippy, or not done quite as well, but overall solid around. All in all, Disney's abilities to blend these elements together are impressive, and this reviewer gives them their well-deserved props. <br/><br/>In terms of casting, there is a mixed response to the cast assembled. Again, they are not the originals (which I did miss), but that doesn't mean they aren't bad just the same. Emma Watson is charming, smart, and courageous (all elements we have seen just without the wand), which works for the protagonist. Dan Stevens I guess does well for the few scenes he isn't covered in CGI fir, but in his monstrous form delivers his lines with surprising depth. But it is Lumiere and Cogsworth who stole the show for me. I worried, I'd be robbed of their relationship, but that wasn't the case. Ewen McGreggor and Ian McKellan stepped up the role, delivering their well- written lines that had me laughing in delight. The rest did well, but I need to move on, so let's just say for the most part, this movie's casting was well-done. <br/><br/>Summary: The music, a staple of Beauty and The Beast that is almost as timeless as the story. This rendition has put their own spin on it, while trying to keep the backbone of the original. Most numbers work, albeit obviously auto-tuned, with their own whim, but the song Gaston was a number I did not enjoy for everything it lacked. Ironically the original tunes I found to be better composed, packed with emotion and not seeming a diluted version, but its weakness came in how they seemed randomly thrown in (yes in an effort to add more emotional develop to the cast). Overall the changes aren't terrible, they just didn't have the same bite as the classics did, unless you count shock factor from either some cheesiness/trippiness). <br/><br/>Other changes that I didn't quite like were Le Fou's changes. Le Fou is supposed to be his name sake, the fool who is comedic relief as the joke, before getting his just desserts. Josh Gadd's rendition wasn't so much a fool, as a smart alec, clingy, admirer who made slick comments and kept his idol at bay. Again, the deeper development is appreciated, but this drastic change kind of meant his name should have been changed as well, perhaps to Petit Malin? Changes aside, the acting is capable of bringing the characters to life, but there are moments where things are a little forced. Some of the Beasts Temper tantrums, a few of Belle's stoic speeches, and Gaston's attempts to be devious, all of these hit their overacted moments at times. And while this made me laugh, there were a few conventional moments that were a bit cheesy (as stated by some in the movie). Most of these coincidental moments are ignorable, but one scene in particular was an anticlimactic finish at the end where something just happened to break at the right time. <br/><br/>All of these moments alone aren't too bad, but many of the changes brought into this film brought it more into the adult/realistic and took away from the fun, whimsical nature of the movie. The design of the characters, the emotional subplots, even the music were lacking that element of childlike fun that made the movie so memorable for me. Doesn't mean it isn't still entertaining, I just really missed that element. <br/><br/>The VERDICT:<br/><br/>With the big shoes the original left, this telling did a decent job appealing to many. It is a well- developed remake of the story, with a wonderful cast and setting to bring it to life and capture your heart. While the music didn't quite reach the same heights, and some changes took away the energy, this film certainly has much of the magic that rose promised years ago. Go in there with a clear mind and try not to compare, and you'll be fine. I recommend this for a theater visit (as if I could stop you) and hope you enjoy. <br/><br/>My scores are: Family/Fantasy/Musical: 8.5 Movie Overall: 7.0"

Her Belle is a strong independent woman but fall in love like everyone else. Dan is a very good singer and his Beast is even better than the original.<br/><br/>All the supporting cast is PERFECT.

"xelectricblazex","10","10","22","25 March 2017"," Astonishing!
","I don't really write reviews on movies. I like reading them though. And to be fair, I have never even written a review before. But a movie as beautiful as Beauty And The Beast deserves to be noticed. So before you read, go ahead. Tell me I'm exaggerating. Because, honestly I don't really care if you thought the movie was great or just utter rubbish. The movie was indeed great and made me want to watch it again for the FOURTH time.<br/><br/>Okay, on to my discussion:<br/><br/>First of all, I am just one of those casual moviegoers who like to watch movies that are always popping up in the Internet of how great it is. So one day, I was just surfing the web and I found something rather exciting. Disney was making a live-adaptation of their beloved animated classic, Beauty And The Beast. And I felt like a kid again. Beauty And The Beast was one of my favorite Disney movies of all time and will always have a special place in my heart. After a few months, they had released a trailer that blew up over the Internet. It looked stunning and magical. Everyone was talking about it. <br/><br/>Then it started popping up on Google advertisements. Then on television. Even starring on network commercials in my country. And there was a sudden urge to go into the theater and watch it right then and there. And so I did. When I got there, all seats were taken on THREE different theaters. Was it really that hyped? I felt disappointed. So I thought that I'll go ahead and wait for it next week (because it obviously would go for a second week), to empty the space. The next week I go into the theater yet again... And it was still FULL. Whaaaat?! It's already been a week, yet there's still so much moviegoers. Luckily, I remembered to reserve online in case this would happen. ;)<br/><br/>I got inside and went through the boring advertisements and got out smiling.<br/><br/>Beauty And The Beast is enchanting, entertaining and magical in its own way. And I tell you, DON'T believe the negative reviewers. They just thought that it sucked because it didn't match the original. Maybe it didn't exceed their favor for the original. But from a blind-audience's perspective of both movies, they did a really great job of bringing the movie to life. There wasn't a single set that seemed extraordinary. All were immersing in its set up. In a small provincial town and its townspeople wearing those goofy headdresses that made it look like it was actual real. The musical numbers were great and the choreography was perfect. With my favorite being ""Be Our Guest."" The cast was great and the acting was on point. Not to mention Dan and Emma's roles as quirky but pretty Belle and the horrifying Beast as they find their love for each other despite their differences. I literally was jumping on my seat smiling whenever they both had a scene together. Oh! And the ending made me CRY like a bitch. Which I didn't even feel when I watched the original. I loved Gaston and Le Fou's funny attitude. Le Fou and Lumiere has got to be my favorites! <br/><br/>The only problem was the clear auto-tuning which, to be honest, wasn't really much of a bother to me and I wish that the movie could have been a little bit longer just to add in some extra scenes of Belle and the Beast. :3<br/><br/>What more is there not to love?!<br/><br/>New songs, beautiful sets, stunning costumes, romance, and EMMA WATSON! And what do you get? Well, just might be the best movie ever in 2017 (As of now, that is).<br/><br/>Over all 9.5/10. ðŸ˜€<br/><br/>P.S. Not looking forward for The Little Mermaid :P"
"sherrymovielover","9","38","108","5 March 2017"," Pure Magic- wonderful movie
","This movie is pure magic. Cast, production designs, direction, acting and cinematography is on point.This live action makes you believe that fairy tales can be real. It stays true to original and builds on it. It is much more layered and sophisticated. However,i have to agree some things feel extra in this version. New songs are really good but are not better than original ones.Emma Watson proves herself to be a live action Disney princess.The transformation is complete.She is a wonderful heroine and role model for everyone.She gives this role everything she has. I have never seen her doing this great before.Her performance is absolutely perfect. This should be a career defining role for her. Her singing was good and much less auto-tuned. Acting wise, she was a solid choice. Overall, the CGI on objects was great. All voice actors have done wonderful job. Kevin Kline is such a gift to this film. He has a tiny little song which i think he nails. THE bond between belle and her father is just loving and charming. The only drawback is that the beast looks unfinished and fake at times but Dan Stevens has done a wonderful job. His song 'Evermore'' is great and very emotional. The ballroom scene is spectacular. The transformation scene is well handled . As for LeFou, it was mistake for Disney to make a big deal about him being their first ever gay character because it is barely acknowledged in the film. There are two gay moments in the movie which are barely noticeable and are just for laughs, neither one involves Gaston. This movie just acknowledges that LGBT people exist and leFou happens to be one of them. Nothing more than this. Luke Evans as Gaston has done an incredible job and he is a lot more evil in this version. Beauty and the beast is a perfect movie and maintains the charm of original animated movie. It is really sad that some people are trying to assassinate this wonderful movie. Everybody should go and see this movie."

","When it comes to remakes, no studio does it better than Disney. From Alice In Wonderland to the #1 movie of 2017, Beauty and the Beast, Disney usually does a good job making a live action version of a classic Disney movie happen. The casting, music, vfx, sound mix, and action is well done and the rating has uppened to a PG rating from the original G-rated classic we all grew up with since 1991. I highly recommend you rent this new classic on DVD, digital, or blu ray and enjoy it for what is it...a tale as old as time."
"235SCOPE","6","5","9","23 July 2017"," Dead Behind the Eyes
","The Best:<br/><br/>1. The color is great.<br/><br/>The Worst:<br/><br/>1. Emma Watson can't act. She has a disconcerting Posh British accent that's markedly different from all the other characters, who sound American, even though they're all supposed to come from the same village. In addition to that, she has one expression throughout the entire film. I kept wondering what a young Julie Andrews-type could have done with this part and it made me wanna cry.<br/><br/>2. Kevin Kline can act but doesn't. As usual when he is on film, Kline underacts to a fault. He too has only one expression during the whole movie. <br/><br/>3. The Beast wears a lifeless digital mask that looks, well, lifeless. Regular make-up would have been so much better. Unfortunately, every time he is on screen, you just can't forget you're looking at a special effect that moves awkwardly, with a voice that's slightly out of sync.<br/><br/>4. Mrs. Pots and the rest of the ""enchanted"" non-human characters do not benefit from the transition to ""live action"". In the original version, the teapot, the cup, the candlestick, etc. were some of the liveliest characters. Here, the new animated objects barely have a hint of a face so, without facial expressions, there is no character and, without character, there is no personality. <br/><br/>5. As Jimmy Kimmel once said, ""Here in Hollywood, the only thing we value more than diversity is congratulating ourselves for valuing diversity."" The producers' politically correct decision to cast Black extras as some of the villagers is not only historically incorrect but distorts the reality of how Black people were treated in 18th Century France.<br/><br/>6. The movie is too kinetic. The camera never stops moving, every scene is broken up into countless cuts, all from different angles. I frequently found myself needing the action to stop and let me breathe, but no. This new B&TB is an assault on your senses a-la Transformers. For what's supposed to be a fairy-tale romance with a heart, this is the wrong stylistic choice. <br/><br/>7. More is not more. The size of the production overwhelms the story. Yes, every buck of the 160 million-dollar production is up there on the screen, but this particular story would have benefited from a simpler production. As it is, it seems the director grabbed every opportunity to unleash a cast of dancing thousands upon the audience, together with giant sets and frantic editing. The intimate story between Belle and the Beast gets buried under the massiveness of it all."
"godhatesharper","6","5","9","10 June 2017"," People are not judging this film on its own merits...just viewing it with their reverence for the original.
","After seeing that this film came out on DVD recently and viewing it on a whim, I decided to go on IMDb to get a sort of consensus on it. And...wow! I didn't think I would be in the extreme minority here, because I loved this film. Loved it. Look, I get all the criticism. I was skeptical at first too; I doubted Disney wanted to accomplish anything more than a mindless popcorn flick with this film, knowing hordes of mindless sheeple would flock to the movie in droves because it's a remake of a classic. Pure capitalism is what drives the film industry now, right? But the longer I watched, the more my breath was taken away. Yes, I'm aware that it is pretty damn similar to the original; but the lush beauty of the film has a sheer opulence to rival Versailles. Complaints on the character designs notwithstanding, the absolute beauty of the village and the castle blew my mind. A lot of people are complaining about the lack of originality in this movie. And to that I say...well, it's a remake. I'm aware that remakes can drastically differ from the original, and I have no problems with filmmakers being inspired by another's work. But still...it's a remake, guys. It wasn't the script from the cartoon repeated verbatim; there were some nice, subtle funny new bits thrown in, and I, on one hand, adored the new songs in the film. However, I will concur that the subplot regarding Belle's mom is historically inaccurate and adds nothing to the plot. But regardless, I think the film did a good job of triggering nostalgia while adding its own little flourishes in. Acting and performance wise, I've heard a lot of people complaining about Emma Watson; yes, you can tell she's not a professional singer, but I think she did a perfectly fine job as Belle. The real standouts here are Gaston and LeFou as portrayed by Luke Evans and Josh Gad. They are absolutely hilarious and breathe new life into these characters, and deserve an accolade of some sort just for making them likable alone. Singing wise, yes, you can tell that most of the actors aren't professional singers; none of them were horrid, though. If that sounds like faint praise for a score of ten, it's because I legitimately don't believe ""Emma Watson has a weak voice"" negates the emotions I felt while watching. If you just let yourself enjoy the renewed vitality of these characters and their story, you'll see how genuine the romance feels, how gingerly the characters develop into something there that wasn't there before. Bottom line: it's a beautiful story, that's why it worked in 1991, and that's why it worked yet again in 2017. If anything, this movie rekindled my admiration of the original, and I plan on viewing it again shortly.<br/><br/>Pros: you know what you're getting. Even if you do believe it's a soulless money grab, the elegance of the music and the tenderness of the story cannot be eliminated. Also, the CGI is gorgeous.<br/><br/>Cons: Again, it IS a remake, and if that bothers you, stay away. The character designs of Cogsworth, Lumiere, Mrs. Potts, etc didn't bother me as much as others but definitely not as iconic as original. And yes, Emma Watson is no Paige O'Hara when it comes to singing. That may be a big deal for some people.<br/><br/>In conclusion: Basically, this movie is the film equivalent of someone rewriting your favorite book to be more eloquent, refined, and lavish. Everything is bigger and bolder, but it's still not the original. You'll probably still prefer the original, but you may return to the remake every now and then for a renewed view of the story, that, who knows, may make you appreciate it even more now."
"iamjacksmoviechannel","6","5","9","17 April 2017"," Fine equals disappointing in this case
","1. Belle is basically the Hermione Granger of her time. Like there are so many similarities. 1. They are both empowered females who always have their nose stuck in a book thirsting for more knowledge, #2Â…Â…Â…They both have muggle fathersÂ…see, so many. And Emma Watson convinces you that this character would look past the mundane, and surface level stuff to what is underneath. <br/><br/>2. As an aside though, she seems to live in a town where everyone seems to treat reading like it's the devil's water but it has a library anyway, and that's one of the things here which strikes me as more odd now than the last time I saw this. I mean why does no one else like reading, this version of France seems more like U.S. Congress. <br/><br/>3. The beast is again a cautionary tale here and that caution is- don't be an ******* or you won't get any poon tang. OK, it's a bit more complicated than that. If you don't know, he begins the film as a prince who's vain and detestable but is turned into a beast by an elderly woman who he turns away one night in the cold. He has until the last petal on a rose falls to learn how to love or he and his household are basically trapped this way. So what we can discern from this is, be kind to your elders, and yeah, basically don't be a dick. <br/><br/>4. You can learn a bit more from the courtship here though than from the 1991 film. The movie is trying to prove that there is something beneath all the hair, fangs, and rough exterior and get to the tender soul underneath. So I liked that the two talk and bond over books and she reaches him and vice versa. The lesson is, locking down pretty women is hard work. Yeah, he could have set his sights lower and saved himself much earlier but who wants to be a prince with a desperate chick hanging on your arm.<br/><br/>5. It also helps if you can sing, and Dan Stevens can definitely do that. He brings a gruffness to the beast's voice without sounding like Russell Crowe in Les Miserables, so that's a good thing. Most of the songs are in fact from the 1991 version with a few new ones. One called Evermore is actually really good. Emma actually does a nice job here too, sounding a lot like the Belle from the 1991 film. Only musical choice I would have made differently is make Audra McDonald Mrs. Potts cause she belted ""Tale as Old as Time"" a lot better than Emma Thompson.<br/><br/>6. So let's move on to the film's villain, and i'm seeing a lot of comments that Gaston is just misunderstood and all he needs is a good woman to turn him from narcissistic, preening jackass into a kindly soul like the beast. It's a little bit like saying if Patrick Bateman settled down he'd be less of an American Psycho. Gaston turns more and more into a sociopath as the film goes on, and like millions of women have shown us twice already, that just isn't sexy unless your name is Christian Grey and you own your own sex room. Luke Evans is perfect in this role by the way. <br/><br/>7. It's his little buddy whose been a bit more controversial though as Disney made the announcement that Lefou is gay, which has upset certain parents groups. Well let's make this short and sweet. It's as if no one took a clue from a man singing about the physical attributes, sexiness, and all around perfection of another man in the 1991 film and is now like grandma finally coming to the realization that little Billy and his buddy Henry aren't playing video games all the time in his room. Other than that there is a one second scene at the end of the film, which amounts to just about nothing. This will not cross any kid's radar. <br/><br/>8. Looking at Josh Gad's performance as Lefou though, he did what he could. He's a bit annoying when he doesn't have good material and unfortunately for the most part he doesn't here. <br/><br/>9. But let's talk about the CGI cause there is some confusion here. As we all know the beast's servants are all turned into what it would look like if Pixar ever decided to make a movie about what happens late at night in Bed, Bath, and Beyond. Candlesticks, teapots, clocks, they all move fairly well here but they're expressions came off a bit hollow to me, which is funny because the beast's came off a bit better at times. Did the old lady actually punish the servants more by giving them the facial movement of an overly-botoxed 60 year old? A question I kept asking myself, especially after The Jungle Book last year, is what happened here? This is where I really missed the animated movie most.<br/><br/>10. That hand-held mirror that let's you see everybody all the time that the beast has is actually kinda creepy now when you think about it. <br/><br/>11. Lastly, isn't it odd that the film keeps telling us that Belle wants to explore the world and wants so much more out of life but neither movie really says ""Belle went on to feed the hungry and help the homeless"" or ""Belle traveled the world and became the first female French chef"" or something like that. It's just ""She lived happily ever After"". Who the hell lives happily ever after though? And what does that even mean? Maybe she's just hooked on anti-depressants like a Long Island housewife because her husband has stopped trying. Just saying, she wanted to see the world but seems to be settling into a marriage. Food for thought."
"omgitsdlb","6","5","9","17 April 2017"," Shot-for-shot an inferior remake of the original
","I like to think I keep myself across reviews of films from all quarters but I genuinely can't remember reading one of Beauty and the Beast that divulged it was simply a shot-for-shot remake of the original. So you can understand my disappointment when I came out of the cinema realising I could have saved my money and watched the 1991 classic at home (for me, one of Disney's greatest achievements).<br/><br/>I have enjoyed the recent live-action remakes of Cinderella and (especially) The Jungle Book. Each took the original story and added their own identity with a few nice performances, special effects and surprises thrown in. Beauty and the Beast however stuck firmly to its original, successful model. And after the special effects master- class that was the remake of The Jungle Book, this CGI Beast was horribly fake and stilted in places.<br/><br/>All the best songs were taken straight out of the 1991 edition. All the best scenes were taken straight out of the 1991 edition. And despite, on paper, the best cast yet, every single performance (barring perhaps Luke Evans as Gaston) was eclipsed by the 1991 edition.<br/><br/>I'm glad I spent good money to see the live-action remakes of Cinderella and The Jungle Book. But with Beauty and Beast I feel I've been conned by sloppy and lazy film-making purely for the purpose of 'cashing in' (which Disney have been highly efficient at again I might add).<br/><br/>Not a bad film... just entirely unnecessary. A waste of a great opportunity and a great cast. I'll be sticking to the 1991 original religiously from now on.<br/><br/>Oh, and for my money, some of the singing voices (Especially Emma Watson) have been processed to within an inch of their lives."

","Before entering the theater, I found myself scoffing at a review by someone on IMDb, complaining it was a shot for shot of the animated version. Saying, ""duuuh"". Every line and scene from the trailer was identical; da f*** did you expect?! But oh wooooow was she wrong! It was a compilation of the animated movie and the Broadway adaptation!! Bringing a new experience for some and the best of both worlds for others!<br/><br/>Worth the watch."
"ironhorse_iv","7","5","9","23 March 2017"," This remake is not quite as beautiful as the original 1991 Disney animation movie. It was a paint by number cash grab
","When I first heard that Walt Disney Pictures was remaking the 1991 Disney animation movie of the same name with director, Bill Condon. I was really looking forward to this. Maybe, this version could breathe new life into the traditional classic fairy tale. Sadly, it does not. Instead, the film, of course, not only simply replicating the original movie content â€”i.e.: its script, and â€“ with this â€“ also its corresponding themes, music, moral framework and ""message"", but also its nearly identical ""frame-to-frame"" camera shooting, despite not being animation, features a different cast, have a few new songs and some fixing of loose plot line from the first movie. Both movies tells the same tiresome semi-disturbing story of a bibliophilic young woman, Belle (Emma Watson) developing ""Stockholm Syndrome"" for her captor, the terrifying beast (Voiced by Dan Stevens), because she sees some humanity within him. Without spoiling the movie, too much, while, the first movie is a generally highly critically respected as a work of art, because how well-delivered and well-written, the songs, script and animation was, this film doesn't really stand out on its own, compare to the other classic live-action versions of classical Disney animation movies like 2016's 'The Jungle Book' & 2016's ""Pete's Dragon'. Even mediocre films like 2014's 'Maleficent' & 2015's 'Cinderella', at least, try to do something innovative with the material, they were given. As much as I kinda like 1991's version, I have to say, I kinda don't want the same story, retold to me, again without something fresh. It's sad, because I was really hoping that this movie would be more of a hybrid of the first movie and the traditional story that was written by author, Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont. Who knows, maybe this film could had reintroduce us, to the original idea of the fairy tale that full of surrealist romper, metaphor and allegories imagery like the 2014 remake of the Jean Costeau's 1946's version, while keeping some of that Disney magic around. I wanted to see the version where Belle's father, Maurice (Kevin Kline) is a merchant, having adventures at sea, only to find his treasures in ruins; meanwhile, Belle's sisters and brothers trying to tame the beast and steal his loots for their own, but failing, because they don't see the beautiful inside of the creature. I wanted to see the Beast's treasure turn into rags! It's a powerful message. Better yeah, I want to see the version by Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Villeneuve where Belle is not really a merchant's daughter but the offspring of a king and a good fairy; whom a wicked fairy is trying to killed, in order to marry her father the king; with the Beast, the only creature who can protect her. At least, that version would make more sense with the backstory of the two lovers past being brought up. In this movie, it's pretty pointless, as the tragic of their families don't led to anything. Plus, the whole ex Machina 'magic book' twist would had more purpose in Villeneuve's version than this film where it was rarely picked up. Despite that, the mediocre story isn't the only problem, I have, against this film. The movie pacing is a bit off. There is a lot of filler, that wasn't really needed, like the murder plot of Maurice, instead of going straight to the asylum subplot. One of my biggest complains about this film, is how this movie felt too much like an English accent driven West End stage play with most of the cast, being over theatrical in their singing, and dialogue reading than a realistic French movie. Don't get me wrong, Emma Watson and Dan Stevens are fine performers, when given, great direction, but I felt that, the chemistry for these two, just didn't click, even if the Beast was lot nicer in this version and Belle wasn't such a stuck-up. Maybe, it's because how fake looking, the CGI was. The Beast, never really looked like, he was really there. So, I never really got the idea of them, connecting. The same with the walking, talking home furnishings played by great supporting performers like Ewan McGregor, Ian McKellen, and Emma Thompson. I found them to be, alright, but a bit disjointed. The same can be said about the locations, like the village of Villeneuve and the Castle. It looks like sets with limited structures, filled with a lots of blue screen that was built in a staged studio than real-life locations in France. It was really jarring. I wish, the movie took advance of filming outside, more. Everything looks too control. Even the controversy idea of the movie, introducing more minority and LGBT friendly characters with LeFou (Josh Gad) & Gaston (Luke Evans) wasn't really a big deal, as there was nothing in this, that seem insulting. In the end, it was alright movie to watch in theaters with your kids. Just note that the movie will feel a bit pointless after watching it. After all, you could had save money and just rewatch the first movie that was nominated for Best Picture at home. At least, that is what I felt like."
"ferguson-6","7","12","28","13 March 2017"," A bit dark, yet worthy
","Greetings again from the darkness. An entire generation still enjoys their childhood animated movie memories thanks to Disney's The Little Mermaid (1989), Beauty and the Beast (1991) and The Lion King (1994). We are now a quarter-century later and Disney is looking to re-create the magic (and hopefully cash in) with Live Action versions of all three Â…as it did with Cinderella (2015) and last year's The Jungle Book (sensing a trend?). Up now is director Bill Condon's mixture of live action, CGI and music for Beauty and the Beast.<br/><br/>The 18th century story (1740) by Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Villeneuve was re-written and shortened by Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont after Barbot's death. Director Jean Cocteau's 1946 French film version looks to have been a key influence for this updated 'Beast', while the 2014 version with Vincent Cassel will probably now be rendered forgotten. Screenwriters Stephen Chbosky (The Perks of Being a Wallflower) and Evan Spiliotopoulos (The Huntsman: Winter's War) team with Oscar winner Condon, whose musical movie resume includes Chicago and Dreamgirls, to inject some contemporary aspects to Belle's personality, as well as a bit more backstory for quite a few characters Â… all while staying true to the 1991 version.<br/><br/>Emma Watson proves a nice choice for Belle as she has what it takes to be nice yet tough, while still being an oddball within her own community. Belle is a bookworm who dares to help other girls to read, while also being the brains behind her father's (Kevin Kline) work. She realizes her neighbors view her as a curiosity â€“ and there is even a song to prove it! Ms. Watson brings strength, independence, and courage to the role. These traits and others are on full display even before her first encounter with the beast.<br/><br/>Dan Stevens (""Downton Abbey"") is the beneficiary of an extended backstory for the Prince, which includes a large dance and musical production at the castle, leading to his being cursed for having no love in his heart. Most of the scenes with Beast utilize CGI for the face and head. This effect worked for me as I found the look fascinating and able to fulfill the necessary emotions, though the non-beast Prince would be considered the weakest link in this fairy tale chain.<br/><br/>Since the comparisons to the 1991 version are inevitable, and certainly a matter of personal opinion, Luke Evans made a wonderfully pompous Gaston, while Josh Gad was quite humorous as LeFou, Gaston's loyal sidekick who is also the center of the misplaced controversy (not worthy of discussion here). The staff â€“ both live versions and special effects â€“ includes Ewan McGregor as Lumiere, Ian McKellan as Cogsworth, Emma Thompson as Mrs. Potts, Audra McDonald as Madame Garderobe, Stanley Tucci as Maestro Cadenza and Gugu Mbatha-Raw as Plumette. Each bring their own touch to the roles, with Ms. McDonald being a particular standout, and Ms. Thompson having the most thankless job as replacement for Angela Lansbury.<br/><br/>While I found this version quite enjoyable and well done, it's a bit confusing why the decision was made to go so dark and foreboding. It's not young kid friendly at all, and seems as if the target audience is millennials who were raised on the 1991 version. This was done at the expense of inviting a new generation to explore the story and characters. Parents should probably avoid taking any kids under age 10 or 11, and the film easily could have received a PG-13 rating. 8-time Oscar winner Alan Menken returns to score the film (he did the 1991 version as well), plus he wrote new songs with Tim Rice and there are some original lyrics by Howard Ashman. With only one viewing, it's doubtful any of the new songs will be instant classics, but ""Be Our Guest"" is a definite crowd-pleaser (again). <br/><br/>Of course, it's an impossible task to please everyone when you mess with the classics, but overall, it's a nice twist for fans of the 1991 animated version. Likely a missed opportunity to bring new youngsters into the fantastical BATB world, it does show that the animated to live action transformation can be well done Â… and that's a relief with The Lion King and The Little Mermaid on the way. Dear Disney â€“ don't mess 'em up!"

"AustinOswald","9","14","34","14 March 2017"," A Beauty of a Film
","""Beauty and the Beast"" is a wondrous film that can never be touched...well...unless Disney is the one doing the refurbishments. This classic ""tale as old as time"" was brilliantly reimagined with all of the same pomp and circumstance as the original. The production design and costuming perfectly captured the dark ominous moods while simultaneously highlighting the sheer elegance of the picture. A piece of this elegance was brought about by the film's effervescent and at times, gripping score provided by the composer of the original film's score, Alan Menken. The familiarity of the film in its score and story was astonishing and probably the only thing I could see anybody having a grievance about. However, the picture did provide some much needed backstory that was glossed over in the 1991 version of the film. With that, Disney did a commendable job at adapting several aspects of the story while still maintaining the nostalgia for the film we all know and love. Finally, I must mention that the casting for this film was phenomenal. With Emma Thompson as Mrs. Potts, Ian McKellen and Ewan McGregor as Cogsworth and Lumière, Dan Stevens as Beast, and Emma Watson as Belle, the talent was truly immeasurable. I know that some fans of the beloved animated film were a bit skeptical of Emma Watson in the role of Belle as she had no musical theatre experience prior to playing this cherished Disney Princess. Nevertheless, I can assure those fans that she did an outstanding job as Belle. While Watson's vocals did seem a bit fine-tuned, she still managed to bring a higher level of emotion and meaning to Belle's voice. She boldly characterized the true meaning of feminism all while subtly hinting at Belle's down-to-earth nature. With that, I must say that this film was, without a doubt, transcendent of our modern era. The picture gave life to a new generation of family entertainment, yet it still managed to charm us with its nostalgic vibes. For me, this film lived up to the glory of its predecessor and may have even surpassed it. From now on, when I think of the story of ""Beauty and the Beast,"" I will think of this enchanting masterpiece."
"hjglewis","10","34","97","5 March 2017"," Incredible!
","Bill Condon's adaptation of Beauty and the Beast is nothing short of amazing. Being a fan of the original Beauty and The Beast I was a little nervous going in to the cinema. I really wanted them to get the film right, and they did! The score is genius, the costume design is superb, the production design is great, the direction is amazing. This film was so visually stunning and I couldn't of hoped for better!"
"blowoutthecandles","10","8","17","21 May 2017"," New and a bit alarming
","When I checked the reviews for this movie I couldn't believe my eyes, you'd think by the looks of them this movie would have a 1/10 rating at best. It disturbed me to the point where I felt like making an account and writing my own review, in hopes that perhaps people won't turn away from this great movie after reading all these hate-filled essays.<br/><br/>To start, I do want to point out that I agree with the criticism in one aspect: Emma Watson. She's certainly not Belle, or a good actress overall for that matter. This is coming from someone who's obsessed with the Harry Potter movies, and even then I couldn't tolerate her. She's the same character in all her movies, and that is Emma Watson. I saw someone comparing her to Kristen Stewart in terms of bland acting and just being bland in general, and I second that.<br/><br/>That being said, she didn't ""ruin"" the movie. In fact, I saw past all of that because there were many other things to focus on and enjoy. Beautiful scenes and decoration, great acting (Josh Gad, Luke Evans, Kevin Kline), the enchanted objects are much funnier and more appealing than the original movie's, there's chemistry between the actors, good directing, and most importantly: I love the added songs and character insights. We get to know more about the characters and many questions that were left unanswered in the original are answered in this one. <br/><br/>I wasn't even a big fan of the original and I only went to see it because I love Disney, and I was in for a delightful surprise. <br/><br/>The CGI isn't on the Jungle Book level per se, but it's not bad. The only thing that might tick you is the beast's face animation but not to the point of NOT getting over it as the movie goes. <br/><br/>Most importantly: this is still a children's movie. You can't critique it as if you went in there expecting the depth of the Godfather. From what I can tell, it served its target audience more than fine. <br/><br/>""This is a copy of the original movie!"" If it wasn't, there would be criticism over it NOT sticking to the original story. ""The story is about a wealthy beast who only gets love because he's wealthy!"" OK, why weren't these complaints present in the original movie? Not to mention that this is a *fairy tale*. ""Too much singing!"" There are movies where there are barely any spoken words (ie Les Miserables, Evita) but this isn't one of them, it has a reasonable amount of songs for a musical. ""The original didn't even need a remake!"" And that's your opinion, but a lot of people do want live-action remakes, hence why they're made. A remake can never do any harm to the original movie, in fact if a remake is bad it will only make you like the original movie even better.<br/><br/>I gave this movie 10 stars because I thoroughly enjoyed it. Hell, I can't wait for more live- action remakes!"
"jtbhamming","5","8","17","20 March 2017"," Emma Watson Failed

"tealballoon","5","8","17","19 March 2017"," Not bad, but not as great as expected. Deceiving trailer.
","Firstly I have to say it, have we been watching the same movie? Emma Watson just wasn't able to pull off Belle, she did her best but I didn't buy it. Her smile never feels sincere or have much warmth in it, her default expression always seems angry, which is also out of her control but not the right fit for Belle. As others have stated she isn't at the peak of her craft yet. Some of the humour takes away from the mystique of the film. The other actors did well and the CGI was incredible. The commercial sort of made the movie out to be less of a musical but that wasn't the case. There is tons of singing in the film, which I felt was deceiving as I thought there would only be maybe 2 songs in it, it wasn't overdone but I just anticipated a big change. The last 15 minutes of the film is very entertaining but as a whole the film won't be among the top Disney films ever made. Still a decent film and easy on the eyes. The visuals are the biggest winner and main reason to watch more than once."
"mark.waltz","10","11","26","25 March 2017"," Disney gets it right with a tiny little twist that got extreme conservatives in a twist.
","There are plenty of changes in the movie version of the Broadway version of the hit animated classic, the first animated film to be nominated for an Oscar. It's a colorful blend of live action and computer generated effects where everything seems alive as opposed to painted. Belle is played by the attractive, if not typical a Hollywood beauty (Emma Watson), certainly no pushover for the obnoxious Gaston (Luke Evans). When her eccentric father (Kevin Kline) ends up under the clutches of beast Dan Stevens, Belle offers herself in place of him. His beastliness must vanish, and that falls to Belle to guide him to change, not because he simply has to in order to reverse a curse, but because he wants to out of love for a good woman.<br/><br/>This jumps off the screen from the start, far less pretentious and over the top as similar fantasy tales that dominate the screen a bit too much. Each character is believable, and the modern twist concerning Josh Gad's LeFou, subtle in its insinuations, but scandalous because of press headlines drawing both praises and boo's. While some of the new songs for Broadway have been dropped in favor of new songs (giving new songs Oscar potential), all the favorites of the original movie are there, staged brilliantly as if they were flying off the stage of the Palace or the Ambassador, its Broadway homes.<br/><br/>The household staff, turned into household items which reflect their personality, are a highlight with a delightfully warm Emma Thompson as Mrs. Potts, Ewan MacGregor as Lumiere, Ian McKellan as Cogsworth and Audra McDonald as Madame Garderobe. ""Be Our Guest"" is lusciously staged, and I wiped my eyes quite a bit, both in the beauty and the beast's twin soliloquies and the title song. While I loved and missed the beast's song from the Broadway version cut from the show, the replacement is equally as moving. This should create an instant classic that I hope gets past the controversy and becomes a major smash."
"alinfatu","10","13","32","20 March 2017"," Tale as old as 2017
","This tale as old as time was greatly remade with a few nice touches:<br/><br/>1)Gaston is really vile in this.<br/><br/>2)Beast and Belle's backstory are revealed.<br/><br/>3)LeFou is redeemed.<br/><br/>4)Extended look at the witch(Agatha/The Enchantress)<br/><br/>5)The backstory of the staff and their guilt.<br/><br/>I found the characters to be well represented and some of their roles were extended in a natural yet satisfactory way:<br/><br/>1)Belle:Emma Watson gets to expand her original story to a point where we now know why she ended up in a small,provincial town full of simple people.She is raised to be powerful and independent.After the dance scene with her prince all I could see was Belle and not Emma.Her song,Belle was well timed,sang and arranged making everyone participate and it put in perspective everyone's take on her.She became an inventor now and is attracted to create,given her parents were both artists.Also she made reading more than a hobby,for her it was an escapism,and it felt natural seeing her at the dinner table with a book.She even wants to educate the other girls,to make them grow up into respectable members of the society.<br/><br/>2)The Beast/Prince Adam:Dan Stevens was perfect.He embodied the cruel aspect of his character well and still was able to portray his humanity better than the original could,his eyes were magic and shown dependence,uncertainty,sadness.His character was a sweet boy who lost his mother and was shaped into a luxurious,superficial,extravagant and material man,by his dear father.He finds in Belle an equal and is shown to be more mannered than his animated representation,also more intellectual given the fact he is transformed at a latter age.He is cured in the end and becomes the man Belle helped to shape:a loving,caring and sure man.His original song ""Evermore"" was my favorite,the lyrics are deep and really offer a journey in depth into his mind and soul and the way it was done in the movie went even further to represent his love and loss of Belle.<br/><br/>3)Gaston:Luke Evans landed the role magically and helped the viewers to go behind the looks and see a truly vile,malevolent character,who all his life was after the big prize,Belle and Beast's head.He abandons all and uses manipulation on his fellow citizens to make Maurice seem mad and uses his cruelty to leave the poor man bound to a try for the wolves.He even abandons his best friend and confidant to take what he thought was rightfully his.His song is a jolly combination of humor and dance.And his lead in ""Kill the Beast"" shows his thirst for blood and war also his madness.<br/><br/>4)LeFou:Josh Gad finally gave the character a redemption,turning him into a more lovable self after he was blinded for years by the admiration for his friend,who turned out to be unworthy of him.<br/><br/>5)Maurice:Kevin Kline is tasked to portray a guardian and an intelligent man who lost so much:a home,the woman he loved and is tasked to raise his daughter.He grooms her with all the aspects he loved at her mother,mostly intelligence,taste and over time becomes overly protective. What I particularly liked about him was his lucidity,he wasn't that mad inventor who should end up behind bars because he put people in danger with his constructs.He faces many trials,some new ones being left to be eaten by wolves and sent to an asylum.<br/><br/>6)The staff:All seem on point,but for me the best was Ewan(Lumiere).He seemed more stylish than his animated counterpart.We learn now why in the end the staff accepts their fate,a good explanation which adds to the depth of the characters.<br/><br/>7)Agatha/The Enchantress:She has the role to teach everyone a valuable lesson of how deceiving can one appearance be.She also leaves the magic book which helps expand Belle's story.She lives in the same town as Belle,among common people.She aids Maurice and heals him,proving she has love for the people who are worth her time and is back at the end to lift the spell and make everyone remember the kingdom they once loved.This new addition to the curse offered a good explanation and tied some loose ends,also that everything is rejuvenated with the once cursed rose,strengthening the motif of the royal flower.<br/><br/>They way the used the special effects made me wake up in a real fairy tail,where everything came to life as things progressed.The actual death of the beast and the curse being fulfilled even for a time added tragedy to what it seem a remediable dilemma at times.<br/><br/>The songs were redone to the letter and the new ones are a fine addition to already a classic ensemble.My favorite as I earlier mentioned is Evermore because I can identify with the song very well. Celine Dion is back and her new song ""How does a moment last forever"" offers us a great lesson about love,life and is sang in her distinct,mild voice,with her specific intonation which adds to the melancholy and the message of it.""Be our Guest"" was better done here,on a smaller scale but very melodic,spectacular and charmingly presented(The French way).""Beauty and the Beast"" touched me,but I still prefer the original version,Angela is the mistress of the song.<br/><br/>I loved this movie and I feel we should all enjoy it and learn something from it while we travel trough this classic french fairy tail."

Belle offers to be his prisoner in her father's place.

How Lovely She Is! It is her charm which not only help the breakage of curse of the castle but also our busy work minded minds.Emma Watson is a demure, doll-like Belle, almost a figure who has stepped off the top of a music box; she never gives in to extravagant emotion, or retreats into depression, but maintains a kind of even-tempered dignified romantic solitude. .Her charming presence and her lovely voice is enchanting.No other actress would suite Belle like Emma Watson.From today.Emma Watson is not only the clever witch Hermione but also our enchanting Belle.One of her career best roles.....Love you Emma Watson<br/><br/>2)VFX: Beauty and the Beast has amazing VFX.I got a great nostalgic feel watching the Great Castle and especially our entertaining talking clock Cogsworth ,candelabra Lumiere,kettle Mrs.Potts and her son Chip,everything is sol lively and lovely.And last but not least our terrifying Beast.He is so charming despite of his beastly look.<br/><br/>3)Music: It's the music that makes it particularly special, and appreciating that is entirely the point of the live-action remake. It's hard to imagine a case for this film's existence without the songs – without, say, that five-note ""Tale as Old as Time"" motif,foot tapping Gaston,visual wonder "" Be our Guest"" and many more..Even though they used all the tracks from the original,they still felt lovely.<br/><br/>4)Direction: Bill Condon did a marvelous job by bringing the best live screen adaptation of the classic.Bill Condon's direction and Tobias Schliessler's cinematography must be applauded, especially for making this fairy tale enjoyable for people of all ages.<br/><br/>5)Art and Costumes: Definitely deserves a nomination for Oscars..Such a lovely settings and costumes..Emma looked gorgeous in the yellow gown in the ballroom scene.<br/><br/>6)3D: This has one of the best 3D for a Disney film.It has brilliant pop out effects when the Beast throws a snowball at Belle,Sorry! at audience and when the Chip throws the saucers at the intruders,Sorry! again right at the audience and there are lot of such moments..But disappointed a bit regarding the in screen depth.<br/><br/>So,Beauty and the Beast is the perfect live action adaptation of classic with Emma Watson's flawless portrayal of Belle,splendid VFX ,foot tapping music and charming screenplay..A Must watch for all<br/><br/>My rating 10/10"

","I finally had to change to go back to my childhood with this one. <br/><br/>Many complain the CGI doesn't look realistic. Well how much more realistic do you want a teacup to look?<br/><br/>I avoided spoilers these last weeks, besides Evans and Watson I did not know who else was playing and what a surprise I got. Recently went to see T2 Trainspotting where McGregor was amazing. So seeing him in this one weee hoo. McGregor with a French accent does not disappoint one bit.<br/><br/>Still don't get why it was banned in some parts of the world because of the gay moments. Gad stole the show on so many occasions and made the character so likable.<br/><br/>I for one loved the movie. I felt an emotional connection with the story. It may have been because of it being my first animated movie when I was a kid, it may have been the great acting or the 3D experience. <br/><br/>The thing is, I enjoyed it and I definitely recommend it to all those that want to relive a little bit their childhood."

","This movie is literal copy and paste of the original with a couple new songs added. This movie proves to me that Emma Watson is only good in Harry Potter, her singing in all of the scenes when she sings, make me want to pull my ears out. The beast is a CGI mess, it looks so ugly and unbearable and his actor literally shows no emotion. Most of the scenes in this movie are emotionally contrived.<br/><br/>The plot: The plot in this movie is so predictable that if I fell asleep and woke up at the end I would've gotten the exact same plot i predicted. Mind you I haven't seen the original movie. The beast gets cursed by an enchantress. The curse is broken by true love and then all the antiques and the beast turn back into humans. The end. The worst part in this movie for me is when Belle is introduced in the market place scene, from that moment on, I knew this movie was going to be God awful. Also hardly any of these songs fit any sort of theme with the original.<br/><br/>In conclusion, This movie is a hopeless Hollywood cash grab which is a shameful copy and paste of the original story, save some time and skip this one it isn't worth your time. Go watch the original Beauty and the Beast from what I have heard it is 30 billion times better than this movie."

And the original everyone had American Accents. So why on earth would they choose British accents? It makes the whole thing feel cheap and contrived.<br/><br/>This is one of a hundred ""remakes just to make a remake"" movies and it's unfortunate because if they really had cared about doing the original justice and making a movie people could enjoy..not just ""lets take a sure thing and make millions off it"" it might have been a timeless classic.

"coliez-20097","1","4","7","8 January 2018"," Beyond Overrated
","While I had high hopes for this film, I found it extremely disappointing. <br/><br/>Like its fellow Disney live-action films, Beauty and the Beast bashes its viewers over the head with CGI and an unoriginal plot. The seemingly-perfect cast fell flat and the music was mediocre at best (don't even get me started on the painful performance by Dan Stevens with ""Evermore""). <br/><br/>Additionally, Emma Watson's performance was bearable, but her vocals were abhorrent. When casting your lead role in a musical, it is crucial to cast an actress that can actually sing. When compared to the 1991 and Broadway versions of Beauty and the Beast, Watson's vocals (though hyped-up by fans) are laughable. <br/><br/>This live-action version of Beauty and the Beast was somehow less emotionally-stimulating than the cartoon version (I found that I didn't care for the characters even remotely) and somehow the plot was boring even though it hardly ever strayed from the original. <br/><br/>The only lesson I learned from watching this film: stick to the original versions and stop buying tickets to these lazy, uncreative, overrated live-action movies!"

It mostly follows the footsteps of its predecessor, the animation film, and like it, it creates an enjoyable atmosphere though its wonderful and captivating story. The animated moments are top notch while the characters play their role very well but I cannot escape the feeling that it misses something. It is mostly the same as the animation masterpiece that inspired it, but somehow doesn't manage to stay on par with it, or to create and inspire that feeling that no other movie can.<br/><br/>It is a very well executed film, but it somehow does not have a soul, fact which alters the overall sensation.

"CinemaCocoa","5","4","7","13 April 2017"," People do take comfort in the familiar
","Maybe if this was released in 1991 it would have been a smash hit. Oh wait, it was.<br/><br/>A selfish prince is cursed into the form of a beast, and his castle's servants turned into animate objects, but when a girl enters the castle looking for her lost father, there is hope to lift the curse.<br/><br/>Disney's insistence to churn out these live-action remakes of their most popular animated features is proving extremely divisive, but they really do bring in the money.<br/><br/>People do take comfort in the familiar<br/><br/>I feel bad for children who might experience this interpretation of the story first, and it gives evidence of exactly what's wrong with remaking things. Especially when the original is a priceless gem with little to no flaws. Disney, and director Bill Condon, clearly knew ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"". Indeed, Condon has literally remade Beauty and the Beast, only not as well. Congratulations? 2017's film benefits, like a leech, on the memories of the original movie. To like this movie is to reaffirm love for the original: Oh, this song! I love this song. I refuse to recognise they have replaced a talented Broadway singer for an auto-tuned Emma Watson. Oh, I love this opening song in the village. Oh, because it is shot-for-shot exactly the same as the original?<br/><br/>Sure, okay, die hard fans will lap this up. You can let it wash over you and make you all nostalgic for a faultless Academy Award winning Disney film that still exists. There are improvements. Such as Kevin Kline as Belle's father Maurice, Josh Gad (as a decidedly subtle homosexual LeFou, calm down people) and the introduction of the film are good choices. But these are only good because they buck the film's dogged insistence on following the original's personality exactly. The ending too is surprisingly darker (yet without changing anything). But for everything good, there's plenty wrong. Primarily is one new addition to the plot. The Enchantress that cursed the prince, asides from giving him the magic mirror to show him the outside world to torment him also gives him a magic book. A book that allows the one holding the book to teleport anywhere in the world. This becomes a expositionary device, which I was okay with. But later when Belle is forced to flee the castle to rescue her father (as the original plot demands) in such as hurry as to not change from her ballroom dress, she rides off on her horse. Desperate and maybe too late!  You have a book that can literally take you there instantaneously.<br/><br/>There are many other issues, but none as apparent and seemingly narrow-minded as that. It usually boils down to pacing and screenplay structure, which simply aren't as tight as the original, dragging scenes out with padding. A couple of extra songs that reek of ""we haven't had a song in a while"". Or surreal moments with Belle or Beast's internalisations about one another (in the original) now being sung aloud when in blatant earshot of each other? What?<br/><br/>No, the sets aren't bad and are lavishly detailed, the servants designs are intricate and creative, the idea that the castle is crumpling as the rose wilts is great. But everything feels so passionless and empty, following the stage directions of an existing classic to the letter. A film that takes a cherished and award worthy experience and thinks it can do better, without doing anything new with it and simply running with people's nostalgia."

"lisafordeay","9","8","18","18 March 2017"," If you loved the 1991 classic then be my guest,sit back and enjoy this lavish fairy tale.
","Beauty & The Beast is my 5th favorite movie of all time back in 1991 and when I heard they were going to remake this masterpiece(that was nominated for Best Picture back in 1992)I was kinda skeptic. I literally thought in my head when I heard this that Anne Hathaway,Hugh Jackman,Danny De Vito,Jack Black and Ryan Gosling were going to be it but none of them were and I was surprised by the actual cast in this 2017 version.<br/><br/>So lets begin the review shall we. Now there maybe an odd spoiler but anyways lets start.<br/><br/>In 17th century France a young prince(played by Night At The Museum 3 star Dan Stevens)is a selfish,cold-hearted prince who would throw lavish parties and invite everybody in. But one night however an old beggar woman comes in and offers the prince a red rose for shelter. But when the prince sniggers at the old woman she transforms into an enchantress and curses him to become a hideous creature with the red rose as his time line. The only way to break the curse is if he could love another and earn their love in return then it will break,if not he will remain this way along with his servants. Fast forward a year later and we meet our heroine Belle(played by Harry Potter star Emma Watson)who is the only odd girl in the village as she loves reading books and exploring the world as well as inventing a washing machine to wash her clothes. She catches the eye of a handsome yet arrogant man named Gaston(Luke Evans)who hears her singing and he is instantly drawn to her. But she doesn't like him and he tries to win her over. Meanwhile Belle's father Maurice(played by The Hunchback Of Notre Dame star Kevin Kline sporting a brilliant British accent)is on his way to get Belle a white rose on his trip out when he gets taken by the Beast(Stevens)who holds him as his prisoner. Belle saves him and she takes her father's place(pretty much like the original).At first Belle and the Beast don't see eye to eye as his hot-headed yet diplomatic at the same time. But as the two spend some more time together they of course fall in love. But will Gaston find and kill the Beast. And will the Beast get Belle to fall in love with him before the last petal falls.<br/><br/>Now like I said I loved the 1991 classic of the same name and Belle is one if not my favorite Disney princess of all time. So was I intrigued by this film. The answer is YES, I absolutely loved this version of the film. The visuals were brilliant,the songs(from the original) are all in here along with three other songs How Does A Moment Last Forever,Days Of The Sun and of course my favorite song from the new song list Evermore sung by Dan Stevens. Everything about this film was beautiful and stunning to look at. Emma Watson was great as Belle yet she appears disinterested in certain scenes and her singing isn't as great as ALOT of autotune was involved. Having said that she did nail it out of the park. Dan Stevens who knew he had a great singing voice was also very good. And surprisingly the CGI on the beast was OK but it wasn't as terrible as I thought it was going to be. As for the transformation scene(yes I am going into spoiler mode here,you have been warned)is very sinister and dark. I literally cried and cried when I seen it and trust me its A lot more different than the 1991 version where the Beast gets stabbed,in this one he gets shot 3 times by Gaston. Yes folks Gaston shoots Beast 3 times and BY GOD was I on the edge of my seat.The whole gay controversy didn't bother me with Josh Gad as Lefou being gay because he was just a total dim-witted yet smart sidekick from Gaston's gang.<br/><br/>Overall I loved this movie and Ewan McGregor was very good as Lumiere and Ian McKellan was great as Cogsworth. Alan Menken does the music for this film again so I was happy.<br/><br/>A -<br/><br/>9.5/10<br/><br/>5/5<br/><br/>See it."
"patomartinezfgo","5","9","21","19 March 2017"," If it ain't broken, don't remake it
","Beauty in the Beast is the remake of the Disney classic of the same name. The original Disney film is a classic, but will this film hold up?<br/><br/>In my opinion, no. And here is why: This movie has some astounding CGI and a great production design. The film also contains mostly great performances. Still, these aesthetic aspects cannot make a movie an instant classic.<br/><br/>There is no reason for a remake other than making money. This film is shot-to-shot the original movie with some extra songs and some (rather controversial) change to a character in the story that had no reason to be there other than create buzz for the film.<br/><br/>Think of this movie like the ""Psycho"" remake by Vince Vaughn except not that bad. It is exactly like the original only that in this case, we get to see it played by actors.<br/><br/>If this movie had some reason for existing, I would give it a better grade; because all the characters and the story are still very memorable and good, but the original is the one responsible for that, not the remake."

","Well I absolutely loved this movie. Couldn't give a care that an animated 1991 version was much better!? Animated - not my thing - and truly why would you even make a comparison between a cartoon and a CGI, human acted movie, nonsensical to me. I am far from a Disney fan as all the singing generally drives me crazy but in this case I just sat back and enjoyed it all. I took my 8 year old who enjoyed it immensely. She found the Beast scary, hid her face a few times from the action and swooned over the love story. So in frankness I'm unsure what all the negativity from the adults is all about - oh wait... Yep it's a movie for kids. All very simple, very pure and true to form but shockingly without the animation. I think you could see that was the case from the previews and the posters and the casting. But well, it appears people went hoping Disney would re-write an animated movie and recreate the whole premise to just appease grownups. Had they done that of course - the reviews would be even worse I can guarantee it. If you loved the original story and enjoyed the characters and found the love story and the message of being bigger and better at being a human being .. then you'll love this movie too. It's very beautiful, Emma was fine, Dan was fine ... every one was fine and it was 2 hours of pure entertainment. All I hope for in a movie. I think Disney out did themselves and I HIGHLY recommend it as a modern day reprisal of a much loved animated film without trying to recreate perfection."

The CGI for the beast usually looked really good but at times it looked very average. The relationship between Belle and The Beast was a lot more believable than the original animated movie.

Having only seen a high school production of the story, I actually found this movie very enjoyable, with most of the songs & dialogue the same, and more content that fleshed out the story.

Bella is a very special character, she is not only beautiful, she is affectionate, she is angelic, she has something special and I am sorry but Emma Watson does not have that. It is not a person who sees it and gives you an angelic feeling. But the prince at the end when he leaves, is not a prince either. He has a good photograph, yes, it is a story and shows it to you. Although sometimes it looks too digital.<br/><br/>The address I do not like, because it does not know how to give you heart, it does not know how to reach you. He does not know how to use the camera and what in this type of films can put it where you want it because the planes are computer.<br/><br/>It has left me cold a movie that talks to you about the heart.<br/><br/>Spoiler:<br/><br/>The presentation of beauty seems so bad. It is a kind of copy of the drawings, but to present beautiful in general distant plane, I do not see it. The whole part of the wicked one who becomes a witch when giving the rose, is very badly round, at no time leaves your mouth open. The part that goes to Paris, is a contribution of the film, very well set, but little more. In the end when all the haunted people become people, it does not give you joy, because you have not taken care of them and some go so unnoticed."

","The original was an undisputed masterpiece, and to top the artistry with which it was hand-created by true artists is a potentially doomed challenge. But when this live-action version got a great review in Empire magazine we gave it a chance. <br/><br/>About 10 minutes into the movie we felt like watching a Christmas parade at Eurodisney with surprise celebrity appearances. Or an episode of My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding. By then we knew the movie was doomed: The colors, the over-polished and over-use of CGI (makeup would have created a much more humane beast instead of this emotionless CGI one), the mediocrity of the extra added songs, the pompous styling and the obvious auto-tune on the voices by some director who's clearly a compulsive cleaner, allergic to even the smallest of human imperfections. Take a song like Be Our Guest: In the original movie the graphics transformed this great Menken/Ashman song into a next level highlight. In the new version the song gets unnecessary extensions and looks like Liberace just vomited all over it.<br/><br/>The fact Disney expects us to applaud the fact they put their first gay character in a movie in a time homosexuality is widely accepted is just ridiculous: It's long overdue, but to Disney also a clever marketing tool to generate press. <br/><br/>Bottom line: I guess even Disney isn't perfect but after giving us next level treats like Zootopia, Inside Out and Toy Story 3 I can forgive them..."

But, supposing that everybody reading this review have already seen the original, I would suggest to watch it. Emma Watson is the perfect match for Bell. It gives the character exactly what it needs: confidence, independence, complexity and cleverness. Regarding the gay content, I do not understand why Disney included those unbigous scenes. It is a movie for kids so why do that? The movie would not have lost any value if the scenses were eliminated. Anyway, I have really enjoyed the movie. It is very similar to the original, but a little bit worse. However, if you are a little nostalgic as I was, you will really enjoy it, especially as the original soundtracks were kept."

","I really wanted to like this one. Although I did read many negative reviews. But I figured I would go there with close to no expectations and have a nice time because all movies are OK in cinema. And this one has good actors and good story and big budget - how bad can it be? Well I actually struggled not to leave in middle of the film. <br/><br/>I do have one fault: I have seen the old movie a few times and although I tried not to, my mind kept replaying the old one in parallel with this new one.But this is because it completely fails to capture your attention. It is devoid of any feeling. When a movie is this bad is usually the director so I mostly blame him but all the other aspects are also bad. The actors have no chemistry (there is no feeling of a relation between beauty and the beast), the objects are indeed creepy from time to time, the scenario has been slightly altered but in all the wrong ways and the movie's CGI is also embarrassing at times. The scenery is also far to shiny, I couldn't stay focused on the characters, you constantly have this feeling that the screen is to small and the 3D is also silly at times (rocks and arrows rushing into your eyes, I thought we left that behind). <br/><br/>I stayed hoping that I will appreciate some parts of it but I actually hated it from the first words (the narration has no magic, it just sound like a bored woman) to the last lines between Belle and the Prince. <br/><br/>The only good thing is that it makes you appreciate the old one. Sometimes we take things for granted and believe that it's easy to make a good movie. I mean good story, good actors what can go wrong, right? I used to see the old movie like a typical beautiful Disney cartoon but I have a lot more consideration for it now."

","When the animated Beauty & the Bast premiered in the early 1990s, that was the peak of animation at that time. One could say the same about this new effort as well, for how it seamlessly blends the animation with its perfect casting to make a beautiful film on a number of different levels.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, this movie tells the story that you are accustomed to hearing. Belle (Emma Watson) is a bookworm living in a small, ""boring"" village, with an eccentric father (Kevin Kline) and a macho arrogant court-er, Garcon (Luke Evans), making her life difficult. When her father gets lost on a trip back from the market one night, however, he stumbles upon a castle inhabited by a ferocious Beast (Dan Stevens), who once was a prince but now cursed into an animal until he can know true love (explained in the film's preamble). The ever-doting Belle sets out to retrieve her father, also finds the castle, and the rest is history.<br/><br/>First off, I thought this film did a wonderful job of portraying the basic story that we all know and love. It doesn't mess with too many plot elements, and even adds in a few new wrinkles (always needed to keep a reboot fresh). The film's plot stands the test of time alone, so in this case I'm glad that Disney didn't try to make too many sweeping changes.<br/><br/>Of course, the success/failure of any B&B film is going to come down to the casting of Belle, and Watson is absolutely born to play the role. We're talking once-in-a-lifetime casting here, as there is even synergy between her real life persona and Belle. She is smart/headstrong enough to portray Belle, while also beautiful enough to be a true Disney princess in the golden robe.<br/><br/>All the fun auxiliary roles are fun too, what with Cogsworth (Ian McKellen), Lumiere (Ewen McGregor), Mrs. Potts (Emma Thompson), and Chip (Nathan Mack), among others, livening up the procedures when necessary. No drop-off from the original here.<br/><br/>About the only thing that didn't work for me in the film? Josh Gad's LeFou. Annoying ""gay character"" controversy aside, I just felt like his performance was a bit creepy and forced. I think I would have preferred him to be in awe of Gaston rather than in love with him.<br/><br/>Finally, as I alluded to in the opening, it is amazing how seamless the interaction of reality and digitization meld together here. In years past, certain characters would have ""looked fake"" or it would have had to be fully animated to level the playing field. Not here. Much like ""The Jungle Book"" live-action remake before it, B&B is extremely impressive on the eyes.<br/><br/>Overall, I thought that ""Beauty & the Beast"" was a great take on the old classic. The casting was nearly perfect, the story remained basically intact, and for perhaps the first time in the tale's visual portrayals the meld between human/animal characters dwindles to almost nothing. It may not reinvent the wheel in obvious character or story ways, but the subtle things go a long way in making it a great overall experience that the entire family can enjoy."
"kevschwaller","10","11","28","16 March 2017"," Much better than the original
","I have only written reviews for maybe one or two other movies, so that is how passionately I feel about this film.<br/><br/>This is the best live-action Disney remake thus far. And I absolutely loved Cinderella and The Jungle Book. I'm so sad there are such negative reviews for this film, and I don't really get why, either.<br/><br/>I loved the original. It deserved the first ever animated film nominated for Best Picture. With that being said, this 2017 adaption absolutely perfected, modernized and matured the original. Emma Watson is the perfect Belle; she also makes her more independent, self-aware and bad-ass. She's the perfect 2017 Disney princess. Luke Evans also kills it as Gaston. He has an incredible singing voice and really brings the character to life.<br/><br/>The CGI really blows it out of the water. ""Be Our Guest"", the huge number in the original, is the best part of the film. I was clapping and gasping at how stunning the scene was. It's one of the best musical sequences I have ever seen and 99.9999% of it was CGI. <br/><br/>I loved the new songs and character backstories as well. They weren't too much, and I felt like they were appropriately spaced out. <br/><br/>Ewan McGregor, Ewan McKellen and Emma Thompson were INCREDIBLE casting choices and truly gave it their all, despite only physically being on screen for a few short moments. <br/><br/>On to the ""gay moment"" controversy: <br/><br/>LaFou, who is overwhelmingly gay in the cartoon, is much less of the ""butt-of-the- joke"" sidekick in this adaption. He is definitely comedic, for that's the role of LaFou, but he is also very level-headed, despite his affection for Gaston. I like that they made him more flamboyant, because, as stated, he is overwhelmingly gay. Also, I loved that they made an effort to show him switch from a female to male dance partner in that ""gay scene"" that shocked the nation. It gave him a happy ending, which he very much deserved, and overall humanized him, despite being the ""bad guy's sidekick"". <br/><br/>Overall, the effects, production design, sound, acting, singing and directing were phenomenal. I hope the online scores improve when more people see it - this film is truly special, and really sticks to the original while very much making it its own. <br/><br/>If anything, go see it for the incredible cast! You will NOT be let down."
"jn1356-1","10","10","25","18 March 2017"," It's not New York Metropolitan Opera vocal quality. AND I DON'T CARE!
","DISCLAIMER: I am head-over-heels in love with Emma Watson. I am predisposed to love anything she does because she does it.<br/><br/>DISCLAIMER: I am head-over-heels in love with Alan Menken. If he writes the music, I'm there.<br/><br/>DISCLAIMER: I love loving things. I hate hating things. It makes no sense to me to equate intelligence with the ability to find fault. Sometimes I see what they were going for and applaud the effort. Sometimes I see what they were going for and weep at how badly they missed it.<br/><br/>That being said, I LOVED the new ""Beauty and the Beast"". I was wiping tears from the corners of my eyes frequently for sheer beauty.<br/><br/>The original cartoon I loved. Even though there were holes in the plot you could drive a battleship through. They fixed all the plot holes! Go see it, if only for that! <br/><br/>Okay, okay, Emma Watson isn't a classically-trained coloratura soprano. She's no Paige O'Hara vocally. For that matter, I missed Jerry Orbach when Ewen MacGregor was singing ""Be Our Guest"" and I missed Angela Lansbury in Emma Thompson's ""Beauty and the Beast"". I understand Orbach is no longer available and the supernatural Ms. Lansbury, in her 90's, probably couldn't do the song the justice she did a quarter of a century ago. Guess what. I DON'T CARE! They did justice to the songs. They didn't do brilliance with the songs. I don't care.<br/><br/>Emma has a divinely expressive face that carries her emotions perfectly for the big screen. Her Belle was glorious.<br/><br/>Is it possible to miscast Kevin Kline? He is brilliant. And his Maurice is delicious. His singing, still not New York Metropolitan Opera quality, carries the song.<br/><br/>Luke Evans does just the lightest touch of camp in playing Gaston. I reveled in it! Once again, not the vocal quality of Richard White, and I did miss that amazing bass. But the baritone/tenor carried it off.<br/><br/>Now, let's get to Josh Gad.<br/><br/>Bill Condon did the lightest hat tip to the Gender Community with Josh Gad's Lefou. If you blink, you might miss it. If you're terrified your little ones might get gay cooties on them and grow up ""perverts"", by all means skip this show. But you'd probably better not let them watch any television, listen to any music, or attend any movies, because the portrayals there are not teensy hat-tips. They are full-body bows and curtsies.<br/><br/>Now for the real star of the show: The music.<br/><br/>Alan Menken is a living miracle. He does things with a musical score and songs that blow me through the wall! All the new songs are brilliant! Beast's song of pain over Belle is stunning. THOSE vocals are magnificent! I've always loved the opening number of ""Beauty and the Beast"". It is full-blown grand opera, and makes me wish Alan Menken would write a sure-enough opera.<br/><br/>This movie dazzled me visually, musically, and emotionally. Yes, there are some things that seemed to me flaws. Guess what. I don't care! You have my highest recommendation."

","I was a child when Disney 1st released the same movie as a cartoon and delighted by watching this with romance, humor and some emotional scenes with excellent music. This changed from the original a bit though didn't harm the story what we knew. An excellent effort from Disney again and hope they will thrill us producing more. I've read some critics from some people above and saw some negative comments. But trust me this is a movie you could watch with your children and there you have to imagine like a child. This is surely a movie worth watching. I have to straightly mentioned this. I've little frustrated by seeing some horrible reviews from some people here.

","First, one thing must be clear, this movie is intended for children first, then their parents.<br/><br/>With that mentality, it becomes clear that the movie is almost perfect, and it beings back some elements missing from Disney more recent releases.<br/><br/>The story is redone almost step by step from the original animated movie, something you gotta give credit for, since the original had great pace and good story line, the little out of the plot incursions are so minor that they don't spoil the narration.<br/><br/>The production is the highest point, every single detail was done to be really close to the animated material, to the point where Belle's yellow dress had to receive gold decals by means of animation.<br/><br/>There are no plot twists, which made me enjoy the movie even more.<br/><br/>The gold point here is that Disney did what no one expected, a perfect production for the already perfect history. Every reboot, re film, Live action and such must have this movie as base from now on.<br/><br/>Great to watch with the kids."
"reidrg","5","9","22","19 March 2017"," Has the magic deserted this retold Disney classic?
","Where fortune favors the brave, this live-action adaptation of a storied classic fails to venture into uncharted territory, instead feeling as though the storyteller is hastily and mechanically executing a sequence of scenes per shareholders' best interests. Throughout the course of this film was bereft a certain magical sensation better evoked by the original animated telling of the 'tale as old as time'. Nothing stands out as being particularly inspiring in this new Beauty and the Beast. No risks are taken. The greatest value is enjoyed in the CGI artistry which indeed is dazzling, yet feels manufactured in order to mask what little depth lies in the storytelling and characters. Thankfully, this version does nothing to taint the well-deserved acclaim garnered by it's predecessor, which will continue to be cherished by many and to many (including myself) will remain the obvious preference of the two pictures."

"sassatelli-25144","10","6","13","24 May 2017"," Visually astonishing for all ages
","I do struggle to understand the reason behind so much hatred towards this movie. Because I went to watch it in the theater and I can't point out anything that is actually wrong with it. The performances were good. Much of the original material was there. So why are people complaining so much? Truth is, I kind of understand both perspectives. People was expecting perhaps a faithful copy of the original only with the live- action change. Disney is bringing back the classics but they don't want to simply redo their old successes. They want a refreshment too. And all the cast and the crew contributed to it in their own ways. Disney always made a point of making movies with a message. ""Beauty and the Beast"" was no different. Now in 2017, they made a great update in my humble opinion including more background from the characters and more themes that were quite pertinent. If you ask me "" Would you take small children to watch it?"" I would immediately reply ""Not before they have watched the first one."" Why? Because this one has way more layers than the first. Small children can't really grasp all of it and that would be a bit of a shame. I've found so many layers and dimension to it, so much is implied between the lines. But you have to go with an open mind. Just thinking back at the other version that French studios did a couple of years ago, I kept thinking these past years that Disney would have to go deeper to run against that. And they did. I couldn't be happier with this new version. It's different, yes it is. But not necessarily in a bad way."

Dan Stevens is the Beast/ Prince and just perfect. Emma Thompson was perfect Mrs. Potts and I believe Angela Lansbury would definitely approve of Emma's turn at singing Beauty and the Beast'. Ewan McGregor was exquisite as Luminere. Ian McKellan was very timely as Cogsworth, perfect. Luke Evans was perfectly evil as Gaston And Josh Gads was perfect goofy as LeFou Kevin Kline was brilliant as Maurice Stanley Tucci was great as the Mistro And the cast was just perfectly magical. <br/><br/>And I loved Agatha the enchantress.

"bob-the-movie-man","8","8","19","19 March 2017"," Tail as old as Kline.
","If you are lucky enough to have children you will know that each child tends to have ""their"" Disney feature: for my second daughter (then 4) that film would be ""Beauty and the Beast"". With a VHS video tape worn down to the substrate, this is a film I know every line of dialogue to (""I'm especially good at expectorating""). So seeing this movie was always going to be a wander down Nostalgia Avenue and a left turn into Emotion Crescent, regardless of how good a film it was. And so it proved. <br/><br/>Taking no chances with a beloved formula, most of the film is an almost exact frame-for-frame recreation of the original, with the odd diversion which, in the main, is to slot in new songs by original composer Alan Menken with Tim Rice lyrics. For, unlike ""La La Land"" this is a proper musical lover's musical with songs dropping in regularly throughout the running time. <br/><br/>Which brings us to Emma Watson's Belle. I've seen review comments that she 'dials it in' with a humourless and soulless portrayal of the iconic bookworm. I can't fathom what film those people were watching! I found Watson to be utterly mesmerising, confident and delightful with a fine (though possibly auto-tuned) singing voice. Her 'Sound of Music' moment (you'll know the one) brought tears to my eyes. There are moments when her acting is highly reminiscent of Hermione Grainger, but this is about as crass a criticism as saying that Harrison Ford has done his ""Knock it Off"" snarl again.<br/><br/>I even felt that the somewhat dodgy bestiality/Stockholm-syndrome thing, inherent in the plot, was deftly handled by her. Curiously (and I feel guilty for even thinking this) the only part I felt slightly icky about was the age difference evident in the final kiss between Watson (now 27) and the transformed beast played by Dan Stevens (""Downton Abbey"") only 8 years her senior. I think the problem here is that it is still difficult for me to decouple the modern feminist woman that is Watson from the picture of the young Hogwarts schoolgirl. (I know this is terrible typecasting, and definitely my bad, but that's the way it is).<br/><br/>Stevens himself is fine as the cursed prince, albeit that most of his scenes are behind the CGI-created wet-rug that is the beast. Similarly, most of the supporting stars (Ewan McGregor as Lumière, Ian McKellen as Cogsworth, Emma Thompson as Mrs Potts and an almost unrecognisable Stanley Tucci as the maestro Cadenza) are similarly confined to voice parts for the majority of the film. Kevin Kline is great as the supremely huggable Maurice. But the performances that really shine though are those of Luke Evans (""The Girl on the Train"") as the odiously boorish Gaston and Josh Gad (Olaf in ""Frozen"") as his hilariously adoring sidekick LeFou. Much has been made of the gay Disney angle to this element of the story, most of which is arrant homophobic nonsense since the scenes are pretty innocuous. In fact the most adventurous 'non-heterosexual' aspect of the film, and a scene that raises by far the biggest laugh, relates to a completely different character.<br/><br/>Most of the songs delivered in the film are OK without surpassing the versions in the original. Only Dan Steven's dramatic new song ""Evermore""- as one of the few really new 'full-length' songs in the film – has 'Oscar nomination' written all over it. However, the film eschews the 'live-filming' approach to song production featured in recent musicals like ""La La Land"" and ""Les Miserables"", with some degree of lip-sync evident. Whilst I understand that 'imperfection' is not a ""Disney thing"", I found that lack of risk- taking a bit of a disappointment.<br/><br/>In terms of the special effects, by today's ""Jungle Book"" standards, they are mediocre at best. I wondered at first if some of the dodgy green-screen work was delivered that way to make it seem more ""cartoony"", but I doubt that – – why bother? More irritatingly, the animated chattels in the castle, especially the candlestick Lumière, are seriously unconvincing. Mrs Potts, the teapot, and her son Chip, the cup, are rendered as flat and two-dimensional. There should have been no shortage of money to thrown at the effects with a reported budget of $160 million. Where has the Disney magic gone? <br/><br/>The film also seems to be rendered primarily for a 3D showing (I saw it in 2D). I say this because some of the panning shots (notably one around the library) to me just ended up as an unimpressive blur of mediocrity. Most odd.<br/><br/>The director is Bill Condon responsible for the modestly well- respected but low-key ""Dreamgirls"" and ""Mr Holmes"" but also the much derided ""Breaking Dawn"" end to the ""Twilight"" series. As such this seems to have been quite a risk that Disney took with such a high profile property, and I would have been intrigued to see what a more innovative director like Chazelle or Iñárritu would have done with it.<br/><br/>However, despite my reservations it is bound to be a MONSTER hit in every sense of the word, and kids aged 5 to 10 will, I predict, absolutely adore it (be warned that kids under 5 may be seriously scared by some of the darker scenes, especially the two wolf- attacks). For a younger age group, I would rate it as an easy 10*. As an adult viewer, given that I have viewed it through the rosy tint of my nostalgia-glasses (unfortunately you cannot hire these at the cinema if you haven't brought your own!), this was an enjoyable watch. Despite my (more than expected!) slew of criticisms above my rating is still a generous 8.<br/><br/>(For the graphical version of this review, and to comment on it, please visit bob-the-movie-man.com)."

","Ever since i saw the first teaser,i was dying to see this childhood favourite animation movie come alive as a liveaction Hollywood adaptation.As any other DisneyFairytale fan,my expectations were way too high with this one.Although i was not very pleased with their casting (EmmaWatson and Luke evans specially),i had no shortage of desperation to finally witness the epic eternal love story produced in today's advanced filmmaking facilities. And i am happy to say that i didn't get disappointed this time.This movie has met all my expectations and exceeded in some aspects.3D effects are extremely aesthetic and quiet a feast to eyes.the CG work of particles,fur,cloth etc is of sheer brilliance (as i would expect with Disney,it was perfectly balanced and neither photorealistic nor cartoonish..) There is nothing to say about the story etc as we all know it since our childhoods.Disney didn't waste runtime on establishing the plot and only focused on its grand ""portrayal"".Which is a good thing (And exactly where Junglebook,Snowwhite n maleficient failed) There is this ""Be our guest"" sequence which is breathtaking beautiful. It just mesmerises for few seconds. Belle is dressed in a magical yellow gown and beast comes up so elegantly there. Cogsworth,lumiere and chip (living objects of the palace) are animated very cutely.I'd not compare their expressions with the 1991 2D masterpiece though,inner child in me loved them all! 3D effects and complimenting cinematography makes you go awestruck quiet regularly till the end. The only thing which could have been wayy better is the ""music"". It wasn't something unpleasant ,but this being a ""musical"",needed freshness and not too stretched singing solos and repetitive same old ensemble BGM we have heard countless times elsewhere. All in all,i am very happy with this movie and i can say that it will stay in my collection for years! This isn't the first time when Disney did a classic remake,this is indeed the first time when Disney made me fall in love again!"

","I'm no expert on CGI, but I do sing. This was my first 3D movie, which was mostly fun, but a bit overwhelming in the crowd scenes. We were fairly near the front of the theater thanks to having to advance-purchase seats, so that was likely a factor. As soon as I heard Audra McDonald's voice, I was hooked. Emma Watson's voice was fine, while Dan Stevens voice was one of the most pleasant surprises of the film. Kevin Kline added depth to Maurice's gentle spirit, while Emma Thompson's characterization was comforting. Luke Evans' Gaston was less air-headed, and seemed more cruel than either the animated or live musical versions, so having Josh Gad as his side-kick was welcome comic relief. The showcase numbers (Be Our Guest, for example) were well done, and fun to experience. The more violent scenes are really not appropriate for the youngest Belles; however, third-graders (maybe second-grade) and older should be fine.<br/><br/>Did it sparkle as much as the animated original? Perhaps not, but the live actors gave it depth and nuance. I enjoyed this version, and would see it again, even in 3D."
"luisgentil","10","7","16","22 May 2017"," Reviews here are overwhelmingly bad and probably shying away those who liked it
","I agree with many of the negative points about the movie. Emma Watson is cute and charming but not the best character for the role, and the CGI beast is awful. Maybe I watched the original film too long ago, but I thought it was a touching and audiovisually gorgeous movie that definitely didn't deserve less than 5 stars (my rating is actually overrated to make it some justice).<br/><br/>In light of the controversy that surrounded the movie, it probably left social justice warriors disappointed. They added a new song in which Belle suggests that she lost her innocence and became a fully grown woman when she started to notice the kinder side of the Beast and grew feelings for him. And LeFou, one of the characters that caused the controversy, is one of the comic reliefs, and a very good one I might add.<br/><br/>This movie is definitely not in the same category as Maleficent, in which the original story was twisted and deformed to fit a political agenda and disown and make fun of Disney's own mythology. It is in almost every aspect a live action version of the original movie with a few liberties taken. <br/><br/>It is beautiful and family safe in every aspect (except maybe for a 2/3 second scene near the end that might raise eyebrows), and it is the same beautiful story of love and sacrifice as the original."

","Emma Watson is a star. ""Beauty and the Beast"" may be flawed in its excess, and is more touching and human than the animated original. Emma Watson is radiant, beautiful, and inspired. This live action reinvention of ""Beauty and the Beast"" remains the ""tale as old as time"". <br/><br/>Watson's Belle is rescued from killer wolves by the brave Beast played by the tormented and noble Dan Stevens, but he is wounded and bleeding from the attack. He fights with great strength and rage. The Beast unexpectedly sacrifices for Belle, and lies on the ground of the wintry forest. Belle turns about to leave and escape her imprisonment. Gentleness melts her visage as she turns back to rescue him in return. ""Beauty and the Beast"" enrolled me then.<br/><br/>The wondrous souls of Watson and Stevens reinvent ""Beauty and the Beast"". Through astounding make-up and CGI effects, Steven's Beast is the towering horned majestic lion. His Beast embodies both joy and suffering in his gentle blue eyes. Stevens accomplishes the nearly impossible. He is a handsome man, and his Beast becomes beautiful as he allows us to see his soul and forsaken dreams. Watson is natural beauty with freckles on her nose. Her Belle's innocence discovers the truth in others, be it the Beast or the ghastly Gaston. Watson and Stevens are beautifully sublime. <br/><br/>With the largely familiar story-line and great songs by Alan Menken and Hal Ashman of the original 1991 animated movie, Director Bill Condon's recreation is about loss, destiny, and falling in love. His spectacular vision creates the haunting images of the wintry forest and the Beast's austere castle. This is a musical, and Condon wonderfully orchestrates the song and dance. He does homage to ""The Sound of Music"" with Belle singing on the hills of her village. <br/><br/>Watson and Stevens make us believe in Belle and Beast's love story. There may be one too many dance numbers or introspective character musical solos. Fortunately, they are not too distracting. Screenwriters Stephen Chbosky and Evan Spiliotopoulos invent the poignant back stories of Belle's and the Beast's deceased Mothers humanizing this fairy tale. This is timeless tale of true love and forgiveness. <br/><br/>The story opens as the narcissist Prince, played by believable Stevens, callously dismisses the gifted rose from an old woman visiting his castle. This was his test. The old woman reveals herself as the Enchantress, played by stunning Hattie Morahan. She casts a spell upon the Prince transforming him into the Beast and his servants into living furniture. He shall remain the Beast until he can fall in love with someone, who loves him back. The Prince must do so before all the petals on the rose fall; otherwise, the curse is forever. <br/><br/>Belle's opening song expresses her uniqueness. She is the independent spirit, who loves books, and has great dreams. They do not include braggart Gaston played by talented Luke Evans, who wants to marry Belle. She tells him, ""I will never marry you."" Belle cares for her watchmaker Father Maurice played by kind Kevin Kline. Belle's Mother died years ago and she was Maurice's love story. He tells Belle of her Mom, ""Your Mother was fearless."" Belle is like her. <br/><br/>One night Maurice becomes lost and trespasses the Beast's castle. Beast imprisons him until Belle bravely takes her Father's place. Beast's servants wonder if Belle is the one, who will break the wicked spell? <br/><br/>As enemies Belle and the Beast aren't so different. They both love Shakespeare. The Beast reads ""Guinevere and Lancelot"", which Belle labels, ""Still a romance."" He too, is a dreamer who loves books. He shares his vast library with Belle.<br/><br/>Belle discovers the servants' loyalty to the Beast. The young prince was very much like his loving Mother. After she died, his Father's cruelty hardened his extraordinary spirit. Belle begins to see his noble wounded heart. The Beast doubts she will end his curse, telling his servants, ""Look at me!"" I know that resolve. He too is falling in love with Belle. <br/><br/>Condon's ballroom dance with the Beast and Belle in golden gown is nostalgic, new, and touching. Emma Thompson as the teapot Mrs. Potts beautifully sings the theme, ""Beauty and the Beast"". Beast frees Belle when tragedy arises. She promises to come back. Candelabra Lumiere, voiced by Ewan McGregor, asks Beast about the spell and Belle. He says, ""I let her go."" Mr. Potts says, ""Because he loves her."" <br/><br/>The miscalculation of the movie is villain Gaston. He is the arrogant stupid narcissist without nuance. We cheer for Belle and Beast against Gaston, often because nothing redeems him. Belle and Beast emerge as heroes in this conflict. Hearing Beast say to Belle ""You came back.""— is so touching. <br/><br/>""Beauty and the Beast"" has a wonderful human quality and spirit. It reminds of the old and recreates as new. Emma Watson is amazing in this ""tale as old as time"". Take a chance on ""Beauty and the Beast""."

","Beauty and the Beast (2017) is a strange film to review as most of it feels like a frame by frame remake of the Disney classic.<br/><br/>It's a good film by the fact that the animated version was great to begin with. Unlike The Jungle Book (2017) which improved on an average Disney film, Beauty and the Beast (2017) doesn't really warrant existing. You could have swapped the film for the original and you would have had the same amount of enjoyment.<br/><br/>Any praise is really that the everyone involved did their jobs capably and produced an admirable copy. Let's hope Aladdin, Dumbo and the Lion King can bring something new and not be 'good' by being safe live action/CGI copies."

","I have been waiting for this movie for a long time, but after watching the movie I was really disappointed. It's not like I don't like this Genre, but this movie, which is the remake of the 1991 Disney Classic, just fell flat. <br/><br/>As everyone says that ""art is subjective"", and it's really true, which can be seen from the various 'Good' rating of the film across different platforms.<br/><br/>In the end, you can give it a try, but only if you like the casting of the movie, and Yes! the sets are amazing(the only good thing about the movie), but one thing which bothered me a lot is the singing, which is literally garbage(not even trying to be politically correct).<br/><br/>I really wanted this to be good movie, but it's a really forgettable movie."

","I gotta admit I did not have the highest expectations before watching this remake of an already great Disney classic. But I was hopeful as I try to be before watching any movie.<br/><br/>And yes they did stay true to parts of the original, unfortunately all the extra/new scenes, dialogues & poorly attempted funny punts absolutely ruined it for me. It did not work at all in my humble opinion. <br/><br/>For some reason I felt confused at times, as to how far into the movie I was. I blame the fact that some of scenes were altered to much & all the extra obsolete stuff they tried to bring to the movie. <br/><br/>I don't feel like the actors necessarily did the worst job in the world, but I expected better & unfortunately even some of the original lines & scenes were poorly performed & seemed forced. I don't think the wrong actors were picked for the roles necessarily, It seemed mostly like really bad directing.<br/><br/>If they should have done anything they should have tried & put a whole new spin on the tale, but instead they fell short by staying somewhat true & then adding to what already worked. In my opinion the best would have been to leave Beauty & the Beast alone for now."

"willcrowforyou","4","3","5","2 June 2017"," I agree with sticking to the cartoon
","I totally agree with several of the other user reviews on here that beg you to stick to the cartoon. It is amazing that animated characters do a thousand times better job of emoting than real live human characters in the live action rendition of this film. I love Hermione but her acting in this film is wooden. The Beast doesn't fare much better either. Gaston is pretty good at playing the bad guy, at least he brings some passion to the role. But there is absolutely no chemistry between the two leads. I really don't see the point of making this classic a live action except for the obvious one: for Disney to make even more obscene amounts of money. Since they're making so much money off of all of these remakes and retakes and reruns and reboots why can't they lower the price of admission to Disneyland. We should be allowed in there for free! Just sayin'."
"hydrorion","3","3","5","21 May 2017"," :/
","I wasn't expecting much from this but i will say i'm still more disappointed than i'd hoped. The animated film is just so good, but it's like the people making the new one weren't quite sure why.<br/><br/>Just from a technical standpoint, the movie is really poorly made. Really, really bad pacing. Similar length of many of the scenes we got from the original but packed with three times the dialogue, which made the whole thing rushed. A complete lack of dramatic breathing room in scenes that should've had huge tension. (panning AWAY to a wide shot for intense, iconic moments where there were closeups in the original)<br/><br/>There were so many quick cuts and wide / medium shots it's like the director was afraid of spending too long on faces because the emotional reactions were so short and simplified. The sets all had overhead, bright lighting that took away a lot of the mystery and ambiance that the animated version had. I doubt that kids would even really be able to enjoy this more than the animated one too because the quick, rapid lines don't add anything new and are harder to pay attention to for kids.<br/><br/>The acting was bad all around, and even the really good actors in this had their potential wasted, so i think a good half of the blame at least falls on the script and directing.<br/><br/>I will say that, with some exceptions, the costume designers and production designers really went all-out on this. The first few shots in the film are incredibly beautiful. But the camera doesn't appreciate them and maintains it's wide and medium shots of everything, while they're lit with flat lighting. Frustratingly, Belle's iconic gold-yellow dress they made look like wet juicy fruit gum, even when the extras are dressed to the nines, and the beast's dramatic facial design and color patterns in the original are gone and he's just kind of a gray blob.<br/><br/>You might be able to enjoy the movie for its nostalgic quality or because you like some of the actors but this really doesn't show anybody's best qualities or give us a new take on the story, and it's best just to watch the original again."
"annam_s","5","3","5","27 April 2017"," I'll think of all that might have been
","To cut things short - that's the classic Hollywood everybody wants to watch in the cinema: grandiose, sumptuous, high-quality production. Most chances you'd enjoy it enough to justify the ticket price. And yet, it feels like the fast-chain snack food.<br/><br/>In the marketing campaign and the overall reviews all you can hear is about the Beauty, yet almost nothing about the Beast. If that's not a sign of a grave and essential problem with the movie, I don't know what is. His character is supposed to propel the story on the par with Belle. Yet, her 2 ball gowns received more coverage than him – and frankly speaking, both of them were quite disappointing from my point of view. So, just for a change I'll try to concentrate here on Prince/Beast character.<br/><br/>I never heard about Dan Stevens before, so I had no idea where he came from and what to expect from him. Most of the movie he spends under some of the unsuccessful CGI effects, including alternating his voice. The results are uneven and not really convincing, to say the least. Pretty hard to tell who's to blame – the actor himself or the technological wizards. We'll probably never know.<br/><br/>Let's start with the fact that only on premier photos I noticed that Stevens has perfectly suited eyes for the role – exactly as in 1991 version, piercing, blue color. Yet I didn't notice it in the movie at all. I'm not talking about some silly girly crush, but about the fact that the movie never lets us see the characters eyes, the main tool for an actor to express the emotions on screen.<br/><br/>The CGI/prosthetic free part – let's start with the opening prologue which shows us the prince before the curse and how he deserved it. While, ludicrously over-top, reeking with decadence, opulence and some stupid grimacing on the Dan Stevens' part, it's simultaneously hauntingly effective about hour and half later. It's hard to understand at first, but until the transformation scene we never see prince's real face/appearance. He's covered by the heavy, peacock style make up, luxury clothes and over-indulgent wig. Just in case we didn't get that he's a vain, cold-hearted jerk, not worthy our sympathy. (Subtlety, as the singing, isn't the strong side of the movie). Cut through the rest of the movie till the transformation scene and unexpectedly I was smitten by the delicacy of it. Not a word spoken. The human again prince, in bewildered haze, turns to Belle and just stares at her, deeply breathing, scared to make the first move. Suddenly, you can see HIM. An absolutely changed person who ""finally learned to love"" . And the interaction between them, how they touch each other and finally kiss The movie hits its famous tag line purpose without any special effect, sophisticated dialog and special acting. For one little moment I was blown away by the fairy tale come to life.<br/><br/>But fear not, the next ending scenes successfully ruined the impression. The great celebration ball -another opulent, tasteless and overcrowded affair, just in brighter colors, and every peasant and servant participates this time. The supposedly madly in love couple barely registers somewhere in the middle of meaningless and polite dance, where he barely kisses her hand once. And she makes a joke. About him growing the beard! You see, him being stranded as a hideous beast for years of despair and utter pain (supposedly, isn't it?), now is a matter of laughter, smirks and joking growl. Which brings me to another, highly problematic issue, which wasn't mentioned so far. There isn't any physical believable interaction between the beast/prince and Belle. No buildup whatsoever. In the 1991 version you can constantly see how the beast treasures each moment Belle is in his arms, how he touches gently and playfully her hair when freeing her after the ball, and giving her the mirror. Love is naturally very physical without being vulgar and showy.<br/><br/>Here, except in 2 scenes - the quite flat in itself ball dance and the transformation scene I mentioned, it never happens. They walk and talk, glancing at each other from time to time. At best, hold hands like 2 hippies after shared joint (the reunion scene when the pair emerges to give some hugs to Lumier and Chip all of the sudden). I bet the 1991's cartoon didn't had to spent that much money on showing us, in the final scene, how deeply in love is the waltzing royal pair. They are the epicenter and the heart of the tale. They can't take their eyes of each other, while everyone's eyes are on them as well. Here? Nothing<br/><br/>Returning to the Mr. Stevens acting, I have to admit after all 2 important things. Unlike Watson, he knows how to move in period piece. You should just watch the way she picks up the dish to drink from, and the beast does the same after her, to understand what I mean.<br/><br/>Second –the guy probably isn't a great singer (it's hard to understand after auto tune and tinkering), like Josh Groban, yet he knows how to sing the character song. While tampered by bad directing choice in the movie (I didn't understand until reading some comments in Youtube, that all this weird jumping on the staircases was due to his desire to see Belle as long as possible) his singing solo left enough impression on me to go and check it on Youtube. Listening to it alone, via the headset, with random images from movie before my eyes, it was nothing less than revelation. I highly recommend you to listen yourself to Dan Stevens's version of Evermore on Youtube, close your eyes and imagine the movie you'd like to see with it. Then you'll understand why I summed up my review by the quote from it - I'll think of all that might have been"
"almagrimoira","5","11","29","19 March 2017"," Keeping true to the animated classic, and the fact that art is a receptacle of cultural units, resulted in an anti-gay, pro-ISIS, materialistic film!

It is as if she was meant to come across as non-human. Her expressions, her smirk, added to her clear and perfect singing voice, all contribute to a non-human impression.<br/><br/>The film is a nice nostalgic material, but its outdatedness and the now disturbing messages it has make up for a very dissonant and conflicting viewing experience."

"mirwell","8","10","26","17 March 2017"," Disney's got it's magic back
","I do understand the other critics, especially the 'bad' CGI comments, but I wanted to provide another perspective on this for you.<br/><br/>Cultural context: Yes, this movie requires you to see the original - but if you are open to a new approach and a deeper story, you might never wanna go back to the original again after you've seen this movie.<br/><br/>The story is enhanced in almost every aspect: Plot holes have been closed, motivations and a lot of background are added for all relevant characters. The casting is superb in every detail, the acting is emotive. The direction takes a lot more time to explore feelings than the original did.<br/><br/>Among the deeper story elements - without giving anything away - is an enhanced role for the enchantress. By not knowing how much she is involved, events seem less coincidental and more - well, enchanted. It adds the kind of literal magic the original movie lacked. Just an example: Does the tree really fall by accident or is there something else involved?<br/><br/>Here is also where the CGI adds in. Yes, there are some problems with it: Sometimes you can tell that Emma Watson had no one to play to on set, sometimes the backgrounds look not well keyed out. And the beast as well as the wolves, is close to the uncanny valley. BUT I think this is one of the movies strong suits: You can never really focus on the beast, never really grasp it - just like it should be if you are involved in the story. If it would have been rendered more plastic, it could have looked flat and so real you loose empathy. With the wolves I almost felt they would be transformed humans as well.<br/><br/>So in my opinion, the CGI just adds to illustrate the story.<br/><br/>The new songs by Alan Menken are amazing, the auto-tune and editing on the singing is hidden well (except for the beginning) and the orchestration is much more subtle and dynamic than the original. Going back for Menken and Rice to work on this for the third time in their lives has payed off.<br/><br/>I'd advise you to - if you are going to see the movie for yourself - keep an open mind and remember the sense of wonder you could feel as a child. Because if you let this happen, you will be enchanted as well."

","This movie is easily the best film in 20 years. The set design is beautiful, the music is beautiful, the love story between Belle and The Beast is beautiful. The cast is extremely talented and every performance in this film deserves praise. Emma Watson was born for this role, never have I ever seen someone so perfect for a role they played. Dan Stevens portrays so much emotion through The Beast even under the cgi. Ewan McGregor's voice acting was very impressive, as he even sang the entire ""Be Our Guest"" with an accent he doesn't have. And Luke Evans did all too well of a job making you hate Gaston. Every single cast member had surprisingly really good singing voices, making this the best musical I have ever seen. It is far better than last year's La La Land, which Watson turned down the lead role in for this film. Which I am very fortunate for, as her performance in itself could have made this movie amazing even if the rest of the cast wasn't. Her singing of ""Belle"" and Dan Steven's singing of ""Evermore"" were tear-invoking. The plot was so masterfully written, even including some perfect original scenes and songs. This film should easily be an award contender, and I look forward to seeing it many more times"
"bella2007","10","9","23","27 March 2017"," A step up from previous Disney's animation adaptation movies
","Went to the theater to watch this movie three times and I have zero regrets. The movie meets my expectation and certainly worth the wait. I love everything about this movie; the casting, almost seamless CGI effect, the brand new songs, and the plot which kind of completing the plot holes in the original one.<br/><br/>It is a dream come true to watch Emma Watson plays Belle. Emma is breathtakingly beautiful in it and the movie really exploit her singing (quite good for beginner), acting and dancing skills. I couldn't be more happier that they cast Emma as Belle. Both Emma and Belle are truly a good role model for young girls. Needless to say Belle is my all time favorite Disney princess so I'm probably heavily bias.<br/><br/>And to The Beast of it all, Dan plays Adam so fiercely. He shares about how complicated it was for him to transform into The Beast and I'm seriously amazed how this handsome and charming guy could transform into a monster. Hats off special effect team!<br/><br/>Josh as Lefou and Luke as Gaston are perfect for their respective roles. I can't imagine another actors playing their role other than them. Also I like this version of Lefou because he's less stupid and not a blind follower of Gaston (like in the animated version) which is pretty good.<br/><br/>If you love the original, love fairy tales, love musical or just love the actors, I'm damn sure you would enjoy the movie. See, I wouldn't dedicate one post for it if it is not that good.. So, seriously, this is the best animation adaptation movie by far. Go watch it ❤"

"seannasuti","10","8","20","22 March 2017"," A charming new take on a beloved classic.
","Well, most of the user reviews that I've seen on here for this film are mixed-to-negative so I decided to give it a positive review for a change of pace.<br/><br/>Let me be clear; this isn't going to replace the original film. The original 'Beauty and the Beast' is still very much the masterpiece that made it the first animated film ever to be nominated for Best Picture. Clearly, there were a lot of expectations towards this new film because of that prestigious pedigree. And, clearly, it was one of the riskiest ventures of Disney's recent run of live-action remakes. And because this film is probably the closest to its original out of all the Disney remakes so far, the term 'unnecessary' is being thrown around a lot. Maybe it is, but that doesn't really bother me in the slightest.<br/><br/>Yes, this film has almost the exact same plot as its predecessor, but at the same time, there are some minor touches here and there that at least help it to differentiate itself from the original. At the very least, it's not a 100% carbon copy of what we saw before. Plus, the film is undeniably well-made with gorgeous visuals and an equally gorgeous production design. The classic songs are handled excellently in live-action, the new songs are great additions, and the film's impressively stacked ensemble cast is fantastic.<br/><br/>In short, I know that there are people out there who aren't too big on the remakes. That's fine; no one's forcing you to watch them. But, at the same time, these new films are not negatively impacting their original sources to the high levels that those who oppose them claim they are. At worst, they'd just end up being a mediocre remake that just makes their original counterpart even better by comparison. And yet, that hasn't been the case with most of the recent Disney remakes. They don't replace their original sources; they just serve as a nice little complement to them. This new take on 'Beauty and the Beast' is no exception. So, with that in mind, ignore all the negativity surrounding this film (particularly the completely overblown backlash towards a new aspect of the film that is so subtle, you probably wouldn't have noticed it if everyone hadn't made such a big deal about it) and just enjoy a heartwarming new take on one of Disney's most beloved stories."
"evane_sam","10","8","20","21 March 2017"," Perfect through and through
","I absolutely loved it! Starting from the perfect casting to the songs (old and new).<br/><br/>Emma Watson was perfect for the part of Belle, I couldn't imagine anyone else doing the part justice. She brought a grace to Belle's movements and character that reminded me of old Hollywood (Julie Andrews, Audrey Hepburn). Luke Evans as Gaston and Josh Gad as LeFou were pure perfection as well. I also found that Dan Stevens brought a lot of humanity and humor to the Beast and by the end of the movie I could see why she fell in love with him. I always found the cartoon was a bit rushed in this respect. It felt like they met and the next day they confessed their love and The End. The movie fixed this as well as several other plot holes that the original cartoon had in my opinion. The movie, probably benefiting from being longer than the cartoon, had a much better pace and thus could flesh out the characters more fully. <br/><br/>During ""Be our guest"" I realized that I was smiling from ear to ear and I did not find it overstuffed at all. Others mentioned that the new songs were not catchy like the old ones. I actually left the cinema humming Days in the sun and Evermore. I got the soundtrack and the second I got home and these two songs are practically on a loop since then.<br/><br/>The only thing I did not like was one of the 3D effects. I saw the movie twice in IMAX 3D and the time they pan up to ceiling of Belle's bedroom with all the gold leaves, that scene was completely blurry and I was forced to look away. Other than that the 3D effects were better than expected. It was probably the first time during a 3D movie where I flinched when seeing something coming towards me. Marvel movies never managed to get me :)<br/><br/>I also loved the changes they made to Belle's costumes. The small touches they added here and there were very notable and just perfect.<br/><br/>All in all, I would recommend this movie to anyone and I would even pay to watch it for a 3rd, 4th, 5th time."

"Anurag-Shetty","10","8","20","20 March 2017"," A faithful yet fresh adaptation, of the beloved animated classic.
","Beauty and the Beast is a live action adaptation of the 1991 Disney animated film of the same name. Belle(Emma Watson) decides to take her father's place & be held captive by a man who has been cursed to remain a beast, until he finds true love. Soon, Belle realizes that Beast(Dan Stevens) is not as monstrous as she thinks he is. <br/><br/>Beauty and the Beast is a mind blowing movie. Director Bill Condon & script writers Stephen Chbosky & Evan Spiliotopoulos have remained faithful to the animated Beauty and the Beast(1991), while adding many new & refreshing aspects to the story. I love the fact that Belle is given a detailed backstory in this adaptation. Also, one or two things that didn't make sense in the animated film, have been rectified in the live action movie. This film is a feast for the eyes. All the songs performed by the actors themselves, are colorful, entertaining & visually appealing. The whole movie, especially the song 'Be Our Guest' & the ballroom dance scene will evoke a sense of nostalgia for fans of the animated original. The action set pieces are engaging. The entire film becomes an even better experience because of the 3D. There are so many scenes where objects in the movie, fly right at your face. The visual effects are excellent. The songs composed by Alan Menken are unforgettable. All the actors have sung beautifully. The production design by Sarah Greenwood is amazing. Greenwood has recreated all the beautiful locations from Beauty and the Beast(1991). The cast portray their characters, effortlessly. Emma Watson is the star of the show, as Belle. Watson delivers a spectacular performance & makes the famous & beloved character of Belle, her own. Dan Stevens is wonderful as Beast. Stevens' motion captured performance is commendable, considering he had to walk on stilts during his performance, to appear much taller as Beast. Emma Watson & Dan Stevens share this warm & electrifying chemistry, in all their scenes together. Luke Evans is outstanding as Gaston. Josh Gad is brilliant as LeFou. Kevin Kline is great as Maurice. Hattie Morahan is impressive as Agathe/Enchantress. Ewan McGregor, Ian McKellen, Emma Thompson, Nathan Mack, Audra McDonald, Stanley Tucci & Gugu Mbatha-Raw are superb as Lumiere, Cogsworth, Mrs. Potts, Chip, Madame Garderobe, Maestro Cadenza & Plumette, respectively. Beauty and the Beast is a must watch for the entire family. Go, have a whale of a time!"

","I found many of the top reviews too cruel on their critics when the film was just released on its first day. Having read them before seeing the film with my own eyes, I was truly nervous and worried that it will be a disappointment, yet despite all that I still went and it turned out to be most fulfilling and satisfying. Now I am back from the cinema giving it a 10, well it is not perfect, but it deserve a little compliment and you can not deny some of the beautiful replicate on the old scenes which clearly shows the efforts that the team has put in, and I am not very picky when it comes to actors, I found them singing quite well too considering they are not professionals. During the 2 and half hours. I could not help but held a big smile on my face for over half of the time, it is like a dream come true, with all the most lovely songs and scenes and childhood memories. I was less than 10 years old when I first saw the cartoon version and now at age of 30, I could be in the cinema with my husband, holding his hand and watch it together, it was such a wonderful moment, I want to give a big THANKS to Disney for making all these happen, thank you for all your stories and songs that makes the world with more love and brightness. I hope when I have children they will love your work as much as I do.<br/><br/>Finally I strongly recommend the 3D version, it brings everything more alive and fancy and exhilarating!"
"n_peart_2112","10","11","30","19 March 2017"," It Was Everything I Hoped It Would Be!
","I still remember back in May 2016 when they announced the first Trailer for Beauty and the Beast would be airing tomorrow on Good Morning America and that night...I didn't sleep a wink! The anticipation was incredible, like going to sleep on Christmas Eve! Although it was only a teaser, as soon as the piano played that infamous opening theme, I felt my eyes well up with tears. I don't remember the last time I was this excited for a movie. Now 10 months later, it's all over. The cartoon version is my favourite Disney film so needless to say, I set the bar high, and there would be hell to pay should the 1991 film be dismissed or tarnished. Let's begin with the obvious: The Cast. Everyone has had their own ideas about who were the ideal choices but I feel they got everyone right on this one. A healthy blend of Broadway stage actors and film actors gave the heart and soul needed to this film. Those criticizing Emma for not being a ""singer"" need to cut her a break. When casting a role in a live action musical, more must be considered beyond singing ability such as a recognizable face as well as mannerisms that embody the spirit of the character (like Audrey Hepburn over Julie Andrews in My Fair Lady). Now with the demand of a live action film where previous cartoon incarnations of this character were rendered with a combination of computers, drawings, and an actor who only provided a voice, the complete package must be sought in your leading lady. While not a Broadway singer, Watson's portrayal of Belle comes across as Honest, impassioned, and earnest when expressing through song, her yearning for something more. I am not familiar with Dan Stevens or Luke Evans prior work but whatever it was that Director Bill Condon saw in them, he was right. The emotional ebb and flow that Beast suffers weaves its way into your heart of seeing him as more than just filled with rage without reason. This is showcased the best in the new song ""Evermore"". I was in tears at his broken heart when he releases Belle. He was not born a beast, he was made a beast. Stevens was the right choice. As regrettable as it is to have to give adulation to a character who gives himself plenty enough as it is, the show was undeniably stolen by Luke Evans as Gaston. While the cartoon version has almost more of a comedic element to him until close to the end, this Gaston reveals his true sinister capabilities beyond his unbridled narcissism much sooner, and the audience has a much stronger contempt for Gaston for reasons other than his unhindered persistence of our heroine. The supporting cast does their job exactly as expected among Lumiere, Cogsworth, and Mrs Potts with little deviation from that of their cartoon counterparts, and appropriately so. McGregor does quite a service singing Be Our Guest which, let's be honest, is THE song that comes to mind when people think of this movie, so much that it becomes a tagline with nearly everything to do with it, and Emma Thompson retains all the emotion and simplistic charm in the eponymous song during the infamous ballroom scene that is guaranteed to leave no eye in the audience dry. The scenery of the film leaves little to be desired in the ways of design, as it all suits the architecture of this fantasy world. However, with the kind of financial position an entertainment company like Disney has, I did find that some scenes could have benefited to be shot on live locations. There could have been expansions of atmospheric and emotional enrichment from the addition of an actual dense and dark snow sprinkled forest or a real golden sun kissed barley field embraced by a cloudless baby blue sky when Belle emphatically proclaims her desire for ""adventure in the great wide somewhere"" instead of what were all clearly soundstages in the Disney studio backlot. As for the additions to the story, I felt they were all very well written and did nothing but add to the depth and dimensions of our protagonists. Knowing about Belles mother and Beasts parents were a welcomed addition to what up until now was only answered with conjecture. Let us not forget as well that the 1991 cartoon was a hand drawn piece of work culminating in 2 years to produce an 85 minute film. The addition of another 35 minutes to match the new one would've added a year to schedule and millions in production costs. These additions are not the frivolous and unnecessary expansions that left so many fans disillusioned with the Star Wars trilogy. Finallythe music. What can be said of Alan Menken and the late Howard Ashmen's ingenious music and lyrics that haven't already been stated? While some new songs written by Menken may not stand up to the old classic numbers of this story, they certainly don't take away anything from it either. As mentioned before, the song Evermore is a much welcomed addition that brings a tear to any man who knows the bitter taste of heartbreak. The added sidenote that Disney's people scoured the archives and found Ashmen's lyrics cut from these songs, and are now included in this new film is a particularly touching and heartfelt homage to a man of such tremendous creativity and genius. Affectionately remembered by his friends and family and immortalized in his lyrics, it is a shame that he were not here to see this beautiful film nearly 26 years after the original. <br/><br/>To our friend Howard, who gave a mermaid her voice and a beast his soul, we will be forever grateful.<br/><br/>Though it may not have the prestige of being ""original"", I have no doubt that this film will continue to inspire legions of new Disney fans and reinvigorate the dreams of the old ones. Well Done!!"

","20 March 2017 Film of choice at the Plaza Dorchester tonight - Beauty and the Beast. If I was only allowed to use one word to describe this film I guess it would be spectacular, but I'm glad there are more words available as I want to use a lot of them. This film was sumptuous, extravagant, romantic, dark, joyful, and spectacular. Emma Watson was the perfect casting for Belle as she radiated naivety, beauty and the compassion we come to expect of this character. Dan Stevens played the beast and brought a tenderness to the part. Luke Evans shone as Gaston oozing stupidity, boorishness and an evil sly malevolence when he didn't get his own way. This live action version of the Disney animation excelled in what it does best, bringing the stories of our imagination alive on the screen. There were moments of joy, moments of sorrow, moments that made us laugh and that made us cry, and although we all know the story, I find myself still willing the good guys to win as the film comes to its glorious conclusion. Although I knew who most of the cast were, it was still a wonderful moment when the true characters of the household objects were revealed. I must applaud the costume department and the people in charge of the set, I feel I could watch this film every week for year and look behind the characters to see something new every time. A truly magnificent piece of cinema suitable for the whole family is it a watch and definitely going to be part of my DVD collection. I urge you all to go and see it."

","2017's live action remake of Disney's beauty and the beast is by far better than the original 1991 film. First off, the visual effects and designs are absolutely breathtaking! The set designs are so eloquent and beautiful. Then the costumes, the period costumes are very true to the original and accurate. And the casting is one hundred percent perfect. Emma Watson is a great Belle, she looks a lot like her, speaks a lot like her, and represents the starring character very well. Dan Stevens is good beast, even though you don't get to see him in human form till the very end. And throughout the rest of the film the CGI is so well done and the Beast looks great, doesn't look fake at all. I enjoyed Kevin Kline as belles father very much, he just looks like the character when you first see him and when he talks you just know that was a perfect casting decision. I adored Emma Thompson as Miss Potts, her beautiful singing voice gave me chills, she lit up the screen. There could not have been a better casting choice for LaFou other than Josh Gadd, and if anyone was surprised by his character being gay then I seriously wonder if you have ever seen original film, I applaud Disney for promoting diversity and even giving his character a love interest at the end. Luke Evans as Gaston could not have been better! The writing is very similar to the original animation and it works very well. The musical numbers will blow you away and fill you with awe and wonder. Be my guest is absolutely wonderful. I honestly can't say anything bad about this wonderful film. Take someone to BE YOUR GUEST and go see this! 10/10"

"elizabethxfaith","1","4","8","29 June 2017"," Emotionless and stale
","May contain spoilers. My review talks on scenes that show up on the film that I disliked. <br/><br/>This version of Beauty and the Beast was a huge disappointment. The acting from Watson and Beast was horrible, it seemed as though they had no real connection outside of set and maybe it transferred on film. The film did not evoke any change of heart towards their feelings and thoughts of each other. Only one song. The snow fight was a a joke...they barely showed any physical hints that they were growing more comfortable with each other, let alone falling in love. The ""be my guest"" scene...all there was from Watson was a simple smile...when belle was saying good bye after beast setting her free there was no emotional connection, no hint of any type of love from either belle or beast. It was incredibly stale...you did not see the love grow at all...no romance growing...no insight to internal struggles or regrets or change of heart being shown. There was also barely verbal interaction with Bell and Beast...I can go on and on...but the most emotion I got from the film was Gastons hate towards the beast...I re watched the animated one and the animated one is so much better by light years!"
"spikethepunch23","1","4","8","7 June 2017"," Rubbish
","I had very high hopes for this movie. Emma Watson's performance leaves much to be desired. Her facial expressions are atrocious and far-fetched, not believable The original Belle is beautiful, genuine even though she is a cartoon. The props are terribly executed and look fake. The only good actor here is maybe Philippe the horse. It is hard to compete with the original movie which is truly beautiful."
"Leparsdon","6","4","8","27 May 2017"," Disappointed
","Now I wasn't expecting a shot for shot remake, and this certainly is not that. What I was expecting was something that entertained and gives us a reason to revisit the near perfect 1991 animated version of this film. What we got was heavily and horribly auto tuned Emma Watson, among others and acting that hardly convinced you that anyone was feeling anything genuine at all. The story quickly bored me and I found myself doing other things on my cell phone while watching it, and I got a feeling that the SJW lot had some meddling in how the character of Belle was redone here. The CG was unconvincing, if not all together overly done. I would skip this, as the animated version was way better, and the emotions more raw and convincing."
"atlasmb","9","4","8","24 April 2017"," An Enjoyable Film, But Disney Can Do Better
","There are a plethora of one- and two-star reviews for this film on IMDb. That signifies the film is worthless or nearly worthless, providing no entertainment. This is a radical position to take, especially when its accumulative rating is (currently) 7.8, indicating that many people were entertained.<br/><br/>That does not mean, however, that the film is perfect or that it could not be better.<br/><br/>The story is about the transformative power of love. Being a musical, the viewer should expect romance and music. The music is an established commodity. But how does the film realize the characters, the story, and the action?<br/><br/>I enjoyed Emma Watson as Belle. Her singing voice is more than satisfactory and her acting fits the character. The other primary character--the Beast--is more problematical. His CGI face takes the viewer away from the action and disconnects the two romantic leads. Also, the movement of the Beast sometimes looks weightless, as if the he does not have a large and ponderous presence, which undercuts the menace he is meant to project.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the scenery and I think the camera work was very well done. <br/><br/>Being a Disney fairy tale, we expect more than music and romance; we expect enchantment. The overall effect of the film is enchanting: the depiction of the town of Villaneuve, the renderings of the interiors, the Beast's castle, the landscapes, and the music, of course. There are genuine moments that tug at the heartstrings, that jerk at the tears.<br/><br/>The Beast's facial CGI impacts the emotional content of his scenes somewhat, but the film still delivers the Disney moments of heartbreak and resolution."

Still I thought I might see it, because Disney movies are meant to appeal to all.<br/><br/>I thought the first part was fairly slow and I almost fell asleep half way through. It picked up a little, but not enough.<br/><br/>The movie is highly stylized and lacking in realism, which is not surprising, I suppose. We're in the world of ancient fairy tale, Disney fantasy and CGI. But there were many places where I found myself having to accept some contrived aspect that I didn't really want to accept.<br/><br/>But then every so often the director showed us some beautiful animation, and the movie magic was there for a bit.<br/><br/>The music and story didn't inspire me or even interest me really.<br/><br/>I thought the whole anthropomorphic furniture/household thing was over done.<br/><br/>I had a hard time with the ""beast"" character. I mean, yes, he was half man half mountain goat (or whatever he was supposed to be) but he wasn't exactly a repulsive creature. He had muscles, strength, courage, hair, good looks, intelligence, education and sensitivity. This movie might have been more to the point if the beast had been truly hideous and unattractive. So I didn't really buy into the central moral dilemma of the movie, ie that a man-goat is hideous and that a human girl would never have feelings for a man-goat, or more importantly, that looks don't matter. Have I missed the point somehow?"

I enjoyed the many shot for shot scene's as well as the backstories given to characters we had never seen before and ones we had grown to love. <br/><br/>This retelling is wonderful and if I had to complain about anything it would have to be Emma Watson's auto tuned voice, but other than that she did a fantastic job.

"harry_tk_yung","Null","6","14","18 March 2017"," From fairy tale to animation to musical to movie-of-musical
","There has been not a few publicity attention-grabbers, intentional or otherwise. I like to get them out of the way first.<br/><br/>1. Emma vs Emma. For La La Land, I can visualize Watson to be just as good as Stone and therefore yes, she probably missed an Oscar. For B&TB, however, Stone may not quite reach the level of spirited defiance that Watson either possesses innate or nurtured through the ten years of Hermione-ism.<br/><br/>2. The gay scene(s). Sorry, I must have blinked and miss them.<br/><br/>3. The scene paying tribute to ""The sound of music"". If what we are after is a similar temperament for adventure, Gigi (1958) would be a better example than Maria.<br/><br/>4. Emma Thompson is no match for Angela Lansbury. Myth, totally. If you have heard Lansbury's inadequate singing in ""The Pirates of Penzance"" (1983) you'll see. Even for the title song of B&TB, Thompson is noticeably better than Lansbury.<br/><br/>For musicals, one would be hard pressed to find music that are better than Andrew Lloyd Webber's or lyrics that surpass Alan Jay Lerner's. As a musical, B&TB does not have the stuff to justify a claim to anything more than average. It was quite a while ago when I saw this musical in Broadway and that was a re-run. The only number I remember is the very lovely title song. Watching this latest movie version, therefore, I cannot even tell which are the four new songs written specifically for the movie. They are mostly pleasing to the ear, but that's about it.<br/><br/>I mentioned earlier that Watson can be an equally good Mia while Stone may come slightly short as Belle. This I consider to be an unreserved compliment that Watson deserves. Playing the Beast is the unrecognizable (expected, in makeups) and not-entirely-recognizable (even without makeups)Dan Stevens. I am talking about one of the best-liked characters in ""Downton Abbey"", Matthew Crawley. In B&TB, the dashing prince is only cameo. As the Beast,even behind the torturous makeup, Stevens delivers soul trapped with the Beast. Sings well too, as ""Evermore"" testifies to. Luke Evans takes a holiday from his heroic portrayal of the guy who shot the dragon in the Hobbits trilogy to deliver the part-comical, part-despicable Gaston. Josh Gad is the mandatory, and somewhat campy, sidekick. Best among the in flesh-and-blood support character is Kevin Kline playing Belle's father Maurice. With an Oscar to show, acting for Kline is no issue. You may forget he can sing too as well demonstrated in ""De-Lovely"" (2004) and above-mentioned ""The Pirates of Penzance"" (1983). Less noticeable than the love story but equally affecting in this movie is the father-daughter rapport. Note how, in the opening scene, Belle seems to be reading Maurice's mind and hands him the tools he needs. Later, the sentiment is reprised in the lock-picking scene. The chemistry between Kline and Watson holds its own when compared with that between Stevens and Watson. Just one more to mention is Hattie Morahan as the Enchantress. Those who have seen her in ""Mr Holmes"" is unlikely to forget her as the mysterious woman in the unsolved (until the end of the movie) case.<br/><br/>Now, to the voice-backing characters (with brief cameos in flesh-and-blood). More odd couple paring here. Ewan McGregor as Lumiere the candlestick and Ian McKellen as Cogsworth the clock are delightful with, respectively, over-the-top French accent and well timed gruff jabs. McGregor also delivers respectable singing even if they do not remind you of his romantic crooning in ""Moulin Rouge"" (2001). Equally delightful is the musical pair Stanley Tucci as the maestro-turned-piano and Audra McDonald as the singing wardrobe. Last but not least is aforementioned Emma Thompson as the maternal tea pot, best icing on the cake you can find."

","Growing up watching Disney movies and being a huge fan of the original cartoon of Beauty and the Beast, I went into the new live- action remake with an open mind. And I was pleasantly surprised with the movie and ended up thoroughly enjoying it. <br/><br/>The movie does a wonderful job at filling in holes of the plot missing in the original. It turns the story into something of more meaning, rather than two people who fall in love. Belle's sense of independence and wonder and the emotional struggle the Beast faces are more relate-able in the remake with live actors. <br/><br/>Emma Watson's performance as Belle is great, even with the somewhat auto-tuned singing. Her interpretation of Belle showcases the independence and charisma that the original character has. Dan Stevens performance is equally as good. <br/><br/>In my opinion, the best part of this movie is the directors interpretation and writers addition of many scenes that fill in plot holes. There is more background knowledge given than the original story line, making it different and more realistic. <br/><br/>Overall, worth your time to see."
"buenoschiches","6","5","11","29 March 2017"," Slightly Nostalgic & Incredibly Flat.
","Firstly, can I suggest that perhaps it would have been better had they strayed away from a classic remake, but instead, had created a comedic prequel featuring Gaston and LeFou since they were the real stars of this movie? It is sort of nostalgic- I'll give it that. And I'm not even too mad at the casting choices for any of the main roles. My main concern is with SUCH a big budget for this and after the success of the live-action Jungle Book-- how could a classic like this be given such bad treatment? The CGI was honestly horrendous. I felt it difficult to call this live-action when everything that surrounded the human characters seemed like a really bad theatre set- they didn't even feel like they're in a small, French town. If you're going to really push the CGI route- go full throttle. Don't use it on places that you need it the least- like the Beast's face for example. I'm familiar with Dan Stevens and I could see some of the facial remarks and quirks were him- but that's it. Otherwise, it could have been anyone. It looked like Belle was speaking to a green screen throughout the entire movie. I also didn't love Lumiere's Liberace-esque redesign. But overall- Lumiere and Cogsworth were enjoyable for the most part and Be Our Guest was BY FAR the saving grace as far as the musical numbers were concerned.<br/><br/>If they wanted to do BATB in modern times or re-imagine it- go with it. Go that route. But take it all the way there. I don't think it was a good idea to try and keep the script the same in literally 90% of the movie only to add in a handful of unnecessary extra songs (which weren't actually any good- especially Beast's), the back story of Belle's mom which really did not add anything special to the story and the need to alter the ending by adding in the 'hideous wench' character. What was the point of that? Stick to the original or reinvent it. I didn't mine the slight addition of insinuated gayness of LeFou- I thought it was quite entertaining and very Waylon Smithers/Mr. Burns-esque. I don't understand the uproar, quite frankly. Besides- it's 2017. Can people finally just stop? Being gay isn't a new phenomenon, folks. Just ask Napoleon.<br/><br/>The classic songs felt incredibly flat for me- especially Bonjour. I agree with another review that I didn't understand nor particularly like the odd delays in the song- what was the point? And also, she just didn't really seem to sing with much effort. I like Emma as an actress in most scenarios (I try to forget that she did Bling Ring- arg) but it felt very much like Emma playing the role of Belle in a theatre production- I didn't feel as though she really embodied the character in any way. The stand outs- by far- were Luke Evans and Josh Gad. I don't think they could have done better casting for those roles no matter if you enjoyed the characters or not.<br/><br/>Another thing that felt incredibly dull to me was the colors. I remember seeing the cartoon version of Belle in her glowing, golden dress that was SO beautiful and well-constructed that it honestly just made Emma Watson seem like she was wrapped up in her grandmother's curtains. Like, who did that? If you're going to do ANYTHING the service that it deserves- you can't lack on Belle's dress and that entire Beauty & the Beast dance sequence. It was flat. Where were the colours and the incredible camera angles? I remember one specific ""camera shot"" that swirled around them in the Disney cartoon version where you could also see the rest of the ballroom- I still feel goosebumps. One of the most beautiful scenes I've ever seen.<br/><br/>And lastly- Mrs. Potts' animation was just plain scary to me.<br/><br/>That is all.<br/><br/>Twitter: @steacyc"
"chazzheaton","5","5","11","27 March 2017"," A Bit Disappointing
","I enjoyed this film a lot more than I thought I would! However, there are a lot of problems. I did like how it gave us more detail into the curse. It also added more to the curse, how when each petal falls the castle starts to crumble and the staff become more and more less human. It really added to their desperation. I loved the piano and the wardrobe characters. It was also nice to see some diversity!! <br/><br/>The costumes were fantastic, apart from the yellow dress. I was so disappointed. The girls at conventions can make an exact copy, why can't Disney with a budget of millions? It did not need a 2 hour run time, the parts about Belle's mother could have been cut out. It was nice to know but it added 0 to the story. The best character was Gaston played by Luke Evans. I thought he was fantastic! He really brought the character to life. The Beast wasn't right imo. I didn't really feel anything towards him, in the cartoon the audience can see straight away that he feels guilty about having kept Belle from saying goodbye to her father, he gives her the library etc.You really see his sweet side. However in the live action remake we don't see this, he doesn't give her the library as a gift he just short of shrugs and says something along the lines of ""you can't have it if you want whatever"". There isn't any reason for Belle to fall in love with him. The songs are great and creative, especially Be Our Guest, but the new added songs are dull and forgettable. The magic book was so pointless, it added nothing to the story, in fact it created a small problem. When Belle sees her father in the magic mirror, she runs off on the horse, but if the Beast had the book which could take them anywhere, why would she run all the way home? At least if she did that we wouldn't have to sit through the Beat's song. I was disappointed with the dance scene, there is a great part in the original where the ""camera"" pans down from the chandelier and ends up on the floor as the dance past, for an animated film it is such an achievement and it's a wonderful scene; I was disappointed that they didn't include that famous shot. Again the dress was a let down. <br/><br/>I think the cast was great and all the voice actors did a great job! Apart from Emma Watson, her face was dull, she had a really fake smile during Be Our Guest which was a shame because Belle is really into the routine in the cartoon. Also, when Beast transforms back into the Prince, she's just stood watching with a face like Kirsten Stewart, she's not really in awe or surprised that this is happening right in front of her eyes. The cartoon is so bright and vibrant, it's a wonder to watch. This however, the colour palette was great for the first 20 minutes, but it was really dull for the rest of the movie, which I know they wanted to make a ""darker"" version but I don't think it really worked in this case. <br/><br/>Conclusion: It was OK - but the original cartoon is much better."

","I have to admit it...I was dead wrong about ""Beauty and the Beast"". I had absolutely zero desire to see it because I really hate remakes. The only reason I did was because my wife insisted we go. And, when the wife insists...we go! I have now to thank my wife and must admit she was right...the film is terrific. The only reason I don't score this one an A+ is simply because so much of it is a regurgitation of the wonderful 1991 cartoon version by Disney.<br/><br/>So why am I so positive about this movie? Well, to me it's simply the most visually stunning and artistic film I have ever seen...and I have reviewed thousands and thousands of films. I went to the theater fully expecting to hate the picture...but soon found it took my breath away...not just once but again and again...it's that beautiful. And, what I also really appreciate is that the film is the best looking CGI/live action combination I have ever seen and the 3D effects are much, much better than usual. With most live action films made in 3D, I generally leave with a feeling that I could have enjoyed the movie just as much in 2D as 3. And, all but a few scenes seem as if they were not even shot with 3D in mind. But not Beauty and the Beast. The filmmakers obviously thought out every possible aspect of the movie and each scene used the multidimensionality to its fullest. Because of that, I strongly recommend you not only see the film on the big screen but pay the extra money and see it in 3D. Really, you must see it on the big screen and in 3D. I have no desire to ever see the film on DVD or cable television...it is truly a big and impressive film you must experience in person. You can thank my wife later.<br/><br/>By the way, a side note: I know there's been a lot of hubbub about the character Le Fou in this film because he's gay. I think if Disney hadn't said anything about this before the film was released, most folks would not have really cared one way or the other and many simply wouldn't have noticed. It doesn't smash you over the head and I don't see this movie as some 'gay agenda picture'...and I see it much like I see ""Some Like it Hot"". It's a shame, as I am sure a lot of people who were angered by this gay character probably wouldn't be so angry if they just saw the film and let themselves enjoy it."
"katarinamandic3","6","5","11","25 March 2017"," Didn't do justice to the original
","From the moment I've heard that they will be making live version of Disney's 1991 'Beauty and the Beast' movie, I was beyond excited, and when the first teaser trailer came out I almost started crying because it seemed so promising and made me shiver and nostalgic. Then other trailers started coming out - it still looked promising. Then, I heard Emma singing and that's when I became doubtful. I really hated the way she sang, it seemed so robotic and not even close to the original. But OK, I still decided to give movie a chance. But unfortunately,my suspicions were confirmed - I left the theater slightly disappointed. Whole movie seemed so forced and unnatural, and, like someone already said - Emma keeps playing the same role in all movies, her facial expressions are not much different from Harry Potter and other roles she played. Lumiere, Cogsworth, Mrs. Potts...they were all kind of creepy (especially Mrs. Potts and Chip) and unconvincing. The only two characters that were actually very well played are those of LeFou and Gaston.<br/><br/>As for the songs, they were actually OK most of the time, considering that some of them were ""destroyed"" for me, like 'Be our guest' - how could they mess up with that song?? And as for Emma's singing, it didn't sound THAT bad when you actually watch the film, but still - Paige O'Hara is unbeatable (sorry Emma), and they added some new songs, of which I really liked Evermore. <br/><br/>About transformation scene, it was SO MUCH BETTER in the original, it just seemed to happen so fast and with lack of emotions (considering the fact that this scene was my favorite in the 1991 original and always brought tears to my eyes, I could say that in this movie it was slightly destroyed for me). I wouldn't say it's THAT bad, but could they make it much better? Definitely yes. And about love story between Belle and Beast, it was not convincing at all. In the original you could at least see how romantic story between them is developing, in here - not so much. And about library scene - completely destroyed. In the original you could feel (not just see, but feel) how Belle felt first time she saw the library, and in this version not at all.<br/><br/>I could go all day like this, but I won't. I made my point and I hope I helped you with my review. :)"
"autisticreviewers","5","5","11","23 March 2017"," Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.
","As you are all aware Disney is rebooting all of its cartoon classics and bringing them to life. The last one they rebooted was ""the Jungle Book"" and that was so close to perfection. Sadly Beauty And The Beast is a downfall from that. Jay And Nick (The Autistic Reviewers) will start off this review by starting out with the bad and then ending with the good. We always like to leave on a positive note! The Bad: There are some horrible moments of CGI such as The Beasts face, the wolves and Lumiere (in some scenes). The face of the Beast was just lazy. Don't think it had anything to do with the CGI...after all if Peter Jackson's 2005 version of Kong can look so real there is no reason that The Beasts face could have been done the same or even better. The eyes of the beast are also a problem. The eyes just don't go with the CGI face. You could either make the CGI better or just put a guy in a costume. Lumiere (Ewan McGregor)and Cogsworth (Ian Mckellen) were completely miscast. They didn't capture the charm and humour the original Lumiere and Cogsworth did. Audra Mcdonald who plays Madame Garderobe was annoying as hell. In fact without going too far into the voice cast just didn't capture the heart nor the charm of the original voice actors did with these characters. One of the biggest complaints of this movie was casting Emma Watson as Belle. She just seemed completely fake and kept looking away from the camera all the time as if she was saying to the director ""Am I doing this right? Am I doing this right? Am I supposed to feel this way?"" We always pictured someone like Emma Stone or Rachel Mcadams playing someone like Belle. One other big complaint is the director. The direction was awful. It felt like a Twilight movie, and looking at the directors history of directing he did, in fact direct the finale 2 Twilight Movies. It just did not fit.<br/><br/>The good: The singing and the soundtrack was really good. It had songs from the original movie and even 1 or 2 extra songs thrown in there for entertainment purposes and it does work. Luke Evans as Gaston was the perfect choice. He relive Gaston not only as a bully like he was in the original, but also as a murdering, short tempered man. Josh Gad as Lefou was also another good choice for casting. Him and Luke Evans looked like they knew what they were doing and were having great fun bringing their characters to life. More good news is that Emma Thompson (who plays Mrs. Potts) was the perfect choice to play her. She was he only voice that was convincing and her singing was really good.<br/><br/>Verdict: With a better director and a better actress to play Belle and many others this film could have been saved and made into an excellent reboot like The Jungle Book, but sadly it didn't end up that way. The Autistic Reviewers give this 2/5 stars. 5/10. Check us out on facebook and Instagram!"

","This film tells the story of an arrogant and selfish prince, who is condemned to be a monster by a witch. To break the spell, he has to find true love. <br/><br/>I was captivated by the amazing computer graphics of ""Beauty and the Beast"" right from the start. How the teacup, candelabra, wardrobe and other household items come alive is spectacular. Belle looks stunning, and her character is simply beautiful inside out. This is augmented by Emma Watson's clean, intelligent and sophisticated image. The story is full of love, and it makes my heart melt. The first dinner at the castle scene is spectacular, it's very festive and grand. The ending drives me to tears.

"bkrauser-81-311064","8","9","24","14 March 2017"," A Beast of Manufactured Nostalgia
","Disney continues its unprecedented line of rebooted, re-imagined, and refurbished live-action remakes with the new fangled Beauty and the Beast. And much like last year's Jungle Book (2015) and Pete's Dragon (2015) this one injects just as much chemical perfection into its innards as a robot arm would bestow a Twinkie. It's not a necessary movie per se. But its unabashed zeal and fidelity to the source material (the Disney-fied 1991 film not the Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont tome) has a certain giddiness to it; a certain manufactured innocence.<br/><br/>I'm sure we're all well versed by now on the self-described ""Tale as Old as Time."" A precocious Belle (Watson) falls in love with a surly Beast (Stevens) whose secret heart of gold is hidden underneath layers of loneliness, sadness and fur. There's an enchanted castle, a witch's curse, singing silverware, inexplicable walks through wintry forests without a coat - its basic fairy tale stuff really. Difference this time is Disney has carefully and lovingly set its story on its perch like butterfly taxidermy in frame. Most everything you remember from Beauty and the Beast (1991) is in this film, and everything you don't remember is just a tiny bit better.<br/><br/>What parts you may ask? Well arguably the best thing about Beauty and the Beast is the way it quietly updates the gender politics of the material and does so without feeling pushy or preachy. Much ado was made of the ultimately benign gay character that nearly everyone failed to notice the first (and second) bi-racial kiss in a Disney film. As for Belle, Paige O'Hara certainly had her moment as the progressive page-turning princess but Emma Watson's take on the character comes with a dream of traveling to the great white somewhere and (sort of) accomplishes it. Speaking of which, Watson positively runs away with this role; dawning natural sincerity while belting out gorgeous melodies like she's not even trying.<br/><br/>Do you remember Gaston? In the animated version, the vain hunter-in-chief of Belle's little town had all the charm of a nefarious, dark-haired Johnny Bravo. Here however Luke Evans's meat-headed take on the popular villain pops with campy fun. His interactions with LeFou (Gad), up to and including the song ""Gaston,"" are easily the best parts of the movie.<br/><br/>Yet while these minor improvements are sure to win over the nostalgic, the case against Beauty and the Beast proves much more interesting, at least from a filmic perspective. First let's start with the added songs provided by B&B originator Alan Menken and replacement lyricist Tim Rice. While the songs do their best to slink underneath the film's major melodies, their lack of Howard Ashman's lyrical wordplay and effortless charm clash like burlap underneath layers of purple satin.<br/><br/>Additionally Bill Condon's persnickety attention to detail works for the mechanics of the film to the detriment of the narrative. Every cut, every structural progression, feels stiflingly familiar, and can't help but make everything look paler when compared to the original. Considering the way the film was shot and cut, the middling filler looks presentable while the big scenes all seem overwhelmed by clutter. This is most evident in ""Be Our Guest,"" when Lumiere (McGregor) our photo-realistic French candelabra fills the screen with gauche CGI chaos. It is at that moment I realized; the best part of the 1991 version is the worst part about this one.<br/><br/>Yet despite, its various faults, I can't help but admire this posh little remake. It's a begrudging admiration, like the kind of ambivalence I increasingly feel towards Marvel movies. Only unlike Marvel, which tricks you into thinking you haven't seen all this before, Disney live-action remakes all but announce you've seen this all before, only you shouldn't care. It looks like we'll have to wait a little bit longer before killing this beast."
"davidmvining","3","2","3","27 November 2019"," An ugly and wrong-headed adaptation
","It's fascinating when a remake of a very good movie comes along and utterly fails at almost everything that the original did so well. It doesn't look as good, sound as good, and it doesn't play as well. It's a curious artistic failure.<br/><br/>The movie's problems begin right at the opening with an introductory sequence that falls somewhere between a dramatic scene and a voice over summary of events. It's filmed in exactly the same way as the rest of the film is. There are no filters applied to the visuals to set it apart from the rest of the film. No sepia tone, no old age feel. That would be fine, if the scene were played dramatically, but it's not. The same voiceover that's in the original (almost word for word with some additions) plays over the action. It looks like characters on screen should be talking to each other, but every word they say gets overwritten by the dreamy voiceover playing on top. It's an overall very odd experience that just feels wrong.<br/><br/>The movie then moves immediately into the action of the story with our main character Belle's first musical number, and it's jarring. I don't know if Emma Watson can or cannot sing, but it's pretty obvious that Disney didn't think that she could. She's autotunned to such a ridiculous degree across almost every note of every song she sings that it's frustratingly distracting. And, her first number begins with her belting out some strong notes, but thoroughly overlaid with a digital alteration that's beyond obvious. That's how we begin our big special effects movie musical, with autotune from our star. Either let Watson's imperfect voice through or dub her, don't use autotune, especially not to this degree.<br/><br/>And that stuff isn't really the extent of my problems with the film. There's a weird tendency in these films to extend 90 minute films into two hours. The original animated film is a grand 84 minutes long, and this remake runs 129. That's forty-five more minutes of screentime without really expanding the movie in any significant way. The extensions are a couple of new songs (neither of which are particularly good and don't hold up well to the original songs that surround them), some backstory about Belle's mother that really doesn't deepen her character or provide any further thematic depth, and LeFou.<br/><br/>I'm gonna be honest, I don't think Josh Gad is particularly entertaining, but Disney seems to love him. Every added bit of screentime to his character LeFou feels wasted and, at absolute best, frivolous. In the original, he's support to a secondary character, but in this he now has an arc. He starts as Gaston's lackey, but he grows to reject Gaston and join with the heroes in the final moments of the final battle. In what way does this extend, support, or illuminate anything about the core story of Belle and the Beast? The only way, there is a single way, is to give LeFou a line that makes the irony around Gaston acting like a beast and the Beast acting like a gentleman explicit.<br/><br/>But even with that out of sight and out of mind, the core story feels wrong here too. The scenes (lifted word for word from the original) that lead up to the big musical numbers feel truncated and small. The actors skip through them like the emotional reality that leads up to the music doesn't actually matter. Some of the music comes through fine (""Be Our Guest"" in particular), but there are others that are so mishandled as to border on abuse. ""The Mob Song"" is cut into three sections, ruining the flow of the number completely as the movie goes through half the song, jumps to other stuff, jumps back for another section, jumps away again, and then jumps back to finish it. The idea is to have crosscutting to enhance a feeling of mounting tension, but the movie breaks that tension every time the song abruptly comes to an end. In the hands of a talented creative team, they would have expanded the song into a medley that included the action in the castle, allowing the song to expand in a far more interesting way.<br/><br/>And, honestly, I don't even like how the movie looks. It's extremely set bound and the designs feel overly complicated. I can't get out of my mind the simplicity of Lumiere's design in the original when looking at the over-designed monstrosity that the live action version presents. The CGI doesn't hold up particularly well either. This is a very expensive movie with a lot of money spent across a lot of special effects, and so much of it feels plastic and fake, especially the eponymous Beast.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie feels like it was made by an amateur with too much money and no idea how to fill out the extra minutes. It's a wild disappointment, and a struggle to get through."

","Beauty and the Beast (2017) is a remake that stars Emma Watson as Belle, a young inventor who goes to the ghastly Beast's (Dan Stevens) castle in order to rescue her Father Maurice (Kevin Kline), she becomes captive and learns of the beasts curse which can only be broken by true loves kiss.
Meanwhile the arrogant Gaston (Luke Evans) is driven by his lust for Belle to acts of violence.<br/><br/>The Good:
The supporting cast is Great! McGregor, McKellan, Mbatha-Raw, Tucci, Thompson, Gad and Kline all fit their respective roles remarkably.
Luke Evans is a very fitting Gaston, he played the role very well.<br/><br/>Also good is the architecture, they spent a lot of money bringing the castle to life and it shows!
The added scenes are interesting, they actually add some more character depth by adding backstory.<br/><br/>The Bad:
First the Beast. Dan Stevens performance isn't bad, just bland, it's the CGI however that sucks. The Beast just looks unfinished. It's really an eye-sore.<br/><br/>Next Belle, Emma Watson just ended up being a bad choice. her singing voice is auto-tuned, her delivery of her lines is dull and boring. She's definitely no Paige O'Hara.<br/><br/>Lastly the pacing is bad, the movie really drags at several parts.<br/><br/>Overall I gave it a somewhat positive rating because I really do like the story. but this version of the film is lacking in Disney magic."

"jblunt","8","2","3","29 June 2017"," Wonderful Movie, But It Does Remind Me...
","I love this live-action adaptation of the 1991 Disney animated classic. But every time Emma Watson opens her mouth to sing, it reminds me why the late Marnie Nixon, who overdubbed the singing for several famous tone-deaf actors (e.g. Natalie Wood in West Side Story) in 1950s and 60s movie musicals, had such a distinguished career. Ms. Watson is a lovely person-- who can not sing. <br/><br/>Back in the day, Hollywood producers for a big budget musical most likely would have insisted that Marnie Nixon and other professional singers overdub the singing parts for tone-deaf actors. Now producers seem to insist that tone-deaf actors attempt their own singing--for authenticity, I guess.<br/><br/>I really, really adore this movie. If only the producers had had professional singers overdub the singing parts for Ms. Watson and a few of the other tone-deaf actors, I would enjoy it even more."
"hepi1","5","2","3","6 June 2017"," very far from the original
","The original Beauty and the beast was part of my childhood and I still love it to this day. That being said, I really wanted to like the remake as well. Sadly, it did not come up to my expectations, for everything I saw was merely a visually beautiful shell that did not cover even 50 % of the quality of the 90s classic. The animated film is cinematically and plot-wise better than the live action remake. Some of the scenes were better done and more believable in the animation rather than the live action version(the wolves scene comes to mind as well as the moment Belle finds the rose)The characters are really not well written, especially Watson's Belle who is just really Watson's alter ego and not the Belle I used to watch dozens of times and come to love. Ema's performance comes really weak, especially that the animated character was more emotional and convincing to me. Dan Stevens' Beast's sense of humour was a pleasant surprise, though at moments his behavior was really out of character (prefering Belle to stay in the dungeon, Ms. Potts declaring that he loves Belle, instead of him doing so) and his song was really unnecessary, since his silent suffering over losing Belle in the original was better executed. Gaston was just unconvincing with his at times chaotic behavior, despite Luke Evans being a good actor. Honorable mention goes to Ewan McGreggor, Ian McKellen and Josh Gad, who did well as Lumiere, Cogsworth and LeFou, respectively. The movie delivers in terms of songs and choreography, since it's Disney's specialty, as well in visual effects, but I fear they lost track in telling a good story, given the fact that most of the time it is about characters' social issues, rather than a good old love story(Belle trying to get out of oh, so boring town full of people who are really beneath her and ultimately getting herself into the clutches of the ugly cold-hearted beast, who was taxing the villagers beforehand, so that he can adorn himself with things most beautiful; Belle not keeping her end of the agreement and trying to escape all the time; Beast being cruel because he lost his mother and was raised by an evenly cruel father... the most sensitive theme for some in the movie, which got the movie itself a ban in certain countries, Le Fou's sexuality was well presented, though, with a soft touch in humour in his dialogues with Gaston, and the character switching sides at the end). All in all, if you want to see a classic, that will last for years to come and will continue to inspire, go to the classic!"

Most of the songs are good and it's a good mix between the first version of Disney and the Broadway show.And I like that... But if you don't liked the story in the animated movie, go away. It's not a remake of the cocteau's movie and not even the last one with Vincent Cassel. It's only a family movie with many ingredients to make it work in movie theatres but not many passion. You can laugh, you can cry but there's a lack of feelings. If you had all the mistakes I spoke in the beginning, that's a 5-6 stars."

","We may be amazed by all the magic Disney created with the classic love story Beauty and the Beast. With all the technology involved the recreation of all the characters were magical. Besides the amazing effects, the lesson remains the same: self-love. <br/><br/>Belle is a girl that doesn't fit in, other villagers think she is weird for being interested in books and for not being concerned with how she looks or appearances. In contrast we have Gaston who is the ultimate hunk of the village that comes home from war to seeking wife, everyone in the village wants to marry him, but Belle doesn't. This makes Gaston think she is playing hard-to-get and wants her more. Belle's father is the misunderstood scientist that creates beautiful things to sell in another town. <br/><br/>When Belle is captured in the castle, we meet the Beast as a terrible and selfish person who is kept under the spell. The main character may be Belle with all her intelligence and good-sense that shows us that being intellectual help us see the tragic world we are living with a new approach. <br/><br/>But the character we can all relate to the most is the Beast, the lack of self-esteem is what we may see at every age. How the Beast develops in the story is the self-realization of who he really is and what matters the most: to love ourselves is more important than what others think of us. The Beast is enchanted for his frivolity and what makes him behave like an animal, but when Belle comes and shows him that outer image of himself is not the most important thing, rather he should show who he really is; that is when the change of his own image comes from within. <br/><br/>To know yourself, is to realize that what matters the most to you is what counts, and not what others think matter. Whatever interests us is what we are truly passionate about and not what other tell us. To find ourselves is to learn about who we are and what we are capable of."

","Went to see this movie last night and dragged my husband along for company as all my movie 'buddies' had already been to see it. I fully expected him to be nodding off early into the film, but to my surprise he actually enjoyed it. As for me - I loved it. It has been a long time since I've been to see a good musical (La La Land doesn't fall into this category for me...dismal film); however, for 2+ hours I was able to completely lose myself in this movie and wasn't bored for one minute. The one thing I can't understand is the criticism that Emma Watson has been receiving from lots of reviewers as I thought she was the perfect Belle. Some people even referred to her as being 'unemotional' and too 'cold'. For me; however, Emma captured Belle exquisitely, with just the right mix of angst, vulnerability, strength, longing - and in the end, love. She is a natural beauty without the typical Hollywood glamour - a refreshing change if you ask me. As for Luke Evans - he most definitely nailed it as Gaston!"

","OK, I'm a big fan of the 1991 classic so I had little or no expectations at all about this live action film but I ended up taking my daughter to the theater anyway, and here's the flash: I don't care about people trolling lately on reviews just because there's no longer a forum on IMDb, so in my opinion this movie was spectacular.<br/><br/>I just don't understand some of the haters here; if the story would have distanced too much from the original plot there would be a riot, but now that a true remake has taken place, there are complaints as well. Of course the Beast would look weird; it's not real and it's supposed to look strange in the first place! If producers would have chosen a Halloween costume instead, would some people have been pleased then? As for the music, it was the right decision to use the original songs along with new ones.<br/><br/>One thing I liked about this version was character development, something that was amiss from the 1991 film. Maurice, in example, is 200% more memorable in this rendition, and the newfound feelings between the main characters are not as abrupt as in the first one; also I enjoyed both Belle and Beast's backstories.<br/><br/>The only scene that I quite didn't like was the Beast final transformation; I felt it was kind of rushed after such a steady pace throughout the movie.<br/><br/>I liked all the acting in general; almost no one has commented about Kevin Kline's performance which gave a major enhancement to Maurice's character; Luke Evans as Gaston was remarkable as well... and finally, there's no big deal about Josh Gad's gay character, it was nothing different from other films, except that this is a family-oriented Disney movie and Disney felt they needed to be politically correct about it... overall a magnificent film."

Maleficent was, to a point, fun, but the amount of films they planned to make in such a short time sounded like they were not going to do the originals justice. I found myself proved wrong with Cinderella. Alice in the Looking Glass was a lost cause. (Pete's Dragon, while not a remake of an animated classic, was utterly beautiful). The Jungle Book was nice, but highly overrated in my opinion.<br/><br/>Then there was this. This ... THIS ... is true Disney at its finest. A classical romantic musical adventure extravaganza filled to the brim with a strong story, upraising laughter, marvellous tension and pulled-straight-from-your-heart tears of both sadness and joy. Bill Condon's direction is a complete triumph and, if I may, the best thing he's ever made thus far. Alan Menken's return as composer is spectacular, restoring lyrics that were deleted from the original film and adding in three new and very moving song numbers (Evermore, the Beast's solo, is a personal favourite). Every cast member was masterfully chosen for their roles in both professions of acting and singing; Emma Watson defies all expectations, Dan Stevens puts on a magnificent and awesome Beast, Luke Evans perfectly conveys the villain's immoral tendencies in the form of a realistic psychopath, Kevin Kline and Ian McKellen are as funny as ever, and Ewan McGregor and Emma Thompson pull of their respective roles (and singing) of Lumiere and Mrs. Potts with performances that would make Jerry Orbach and Angela Lansbury proud.<br/><br/>And the music... oh, the music. All the well-remembered and beloved songs of the 1991 animated masterpiece are back, fully realised in all of their resplendent glory and never losing any of their charm.<br/><br/>If it's classic Disney you love, then this is your film."

","For starters, one can never go in, expecting the level of perfection the original had. In 1991 we were given heaven in the shape of some of the most magical lyrics writtenâ€‹ anywhere. The animation wasn't spectacular, but the film was special and had plenty of soul. It was a great picture. The newest entry has new songs, which are decent but nowhere near as spectacular as the original score. However, the new entry does really well in most instances.<br/><br/>The new cast shines providing much of the reality and magic to the living furniture. They, after all, are human. Emma Thompson is strong and sweet. The rest of the cast does a decent job. And there is Belle who in spite of not being a professional singer manages to handle the songs nicely. No superb singing, but she's not a singer, she's alternate misfit. Unlike recent musicals, this is one is touching and fill of memorable and deep interpretations. There's plenty to him along even in the new songs.<br/><br/>I like what they added to the story. Tiny bits that give you some insight about many of the main characters. The prince is not just a beast, but a product of his upbringing. Belle is more complicated and with much going on in her heart and mind.<br/><br/>The musical adaptation is fantastic. The village opening number will leave breathless and the people behind the art direction, sets, and costumes deserve the highest praise. Gowns look glorious and the sets made me believe we were in the middle of an opulent setting. Great job.<br/><br/>Simply, adaptation great films is problematic from the start, yet no misfires here. Condom tops his precious musical entries and manages to keep that soul intact, making us believe in an intelligent romance."
"collegedude3","10","8","21","17 March 2017"," Could Emma Watson be more beautiful??? <3
","I am a guy and admit I only saw this movie because I think Emma Watson is the cutest and most beautiful thing and she looked more beautiful in this movie than any movie I have seen her to date or ever-after all her name is Belle-meaning beautiful in French-and I would have been disappointed if any actress played Belle other than Emma; therefore, Emma playing Belle seemed felicitous. I could be wrong, but I think this is her first movie she has been in where she is really considered the main character.<br/><br/>I am not going to give anything away since I really cannot. I vaguely remember the original 1991 movie that I saw decades ago; but from what I do, the movie does a pretty good job of emulating the original 1991 animated version, while adding its own flair.<br/><br/>A few people I have seen on TV this morning criticized Emma Watson's singing in the movie, but I thought she sounded perfect-then again, maybe I am biased because I have adored her since the Harry Potter Films and have seen all her other movies since. <br/><br/>I thought all of the parts were played perfectly and the film was an overall joy to watch, and didn't feel silly watching this on opening day as a grown man surrounded by mostly very little kids with their parents. I think most of the parents who brought their children probably wanted to see it more than their children.<br/><br/>If any event, I think this movie will go down in history, despite the critics and look forward to getting this on DVD when it comes out. I was a little confused about the part where they flashback about Belle's mother and Belle as a baby and what really happened. Perhaps, it was because I was startled by Emma's beauty. I also did not understand the magical powers of the woman who released Belle's father, as that is never clearly explained and maybe wasn't supposed to be.<br/><br/>The film was great. Emma was beautiful as Belle. Perfect adaptation. Emma was beautiful, especially in those dresses. The film was the perfect length. Emma was even stunning in the very beginning before she wore those dresses in the village-maybe even more beautiful than in the dresses, as she has the most beautiful face. This is a great movie for the whole family, especially if you have kids and gives off a warm feeling and nostalgic feeling of when you saw the original as a kid or adult.<br/><br/>By the way did I happen to mention how unbelievably beautiful and cute Emma Watson was in the movie? 10/10. Three thumbs way up!!!!"
"brie_aguila","10","10","28","21 March 2017"," From a True Fan: A beautiful expansion on the original version
","True fans of the original Beauty and the Beast animated movie will love this updated version. It cannot replace the original, and it should not necessarily be compared to the original. I watched the animated movie well over 100 times during my life, as it was my favorite Disney movie as a kid. I was captivated by this story, and Belle as a character. She was a strong female lead - adventurous, head-strong, and determined - at a time when there were not that many strong female characters on the screen for little girls. Emma Watson's version of Belle expands on Belle as a fearless pioneer in her small village. She is absolutely fearless! I actually liked Emma's Belle better than the original. In all the scenes where she was scared and questioning in the original, here Emma approaches everything head-on, no second guessing herself and her abilities, she just knows she can do anything. I can't help but think she is going to be a wonderful role model for all those little girls out there enjoying this movie. Actually, if I read one more daft review by some dude who wants to comment on how the movie isn't up to par and how ""fake"" everything looks, I will throw myself from the tower! <br/><br/>Can I say that I'm obsessed with the Beast and the actor Dan Stevens, who I was not familiar with before. The writers made his character so complex and rich. The new song that Alan wrote for him called ""Evermore"" has been playing on repeat on my Spotify for days. It is so beautifully written and performed. It is absolutely everything! I always wondered why the Beast didn't have a song in the original. It was well worth the 26 year wait! Dan really brought this character to life - and in all his interviews you can tell how proud he is of all his hard work on stilts and getting into the character of the Beast. <br/><br/>The rest of the cast was also amazing! Luke Evans was the perfect Gaston and Josh Gad - they could not have found a better LeFou. The two of them working together was really a treat. <br/><br/>I keep seeing all these reviews about how everything was CGI and everything looked so fake in the movie - seriously? When you have a movie where the majority of characters are inanimate objects, I'm not quite sure what these people were expecting. I'm not sure how Disney was supposed to have a non-CGI candlestick, or a CGi candlestick that looks 100% real. The technology is amazing, but it will never look exactly real. Also, in regards to the Beast, if people would look at interviews and information on the filming they would know that Disney attempted to fuse two types of technologies for the Beast in this movie. They tried something new that had never been done, which is the have Dan play all his parts in live action, on stilts, in a 40 pound muscle suit with Emma, and then play it again in a booth with facial recognition to get the facial expressions of a real human. The face was matched with the body later. Pretty spectacular stuff, if you think about it. If you look at the expressions of Beast during the movie, you will notice how lifelike his expressions are. They did any amazing job and probably made it as real as it could possibly look. I'm sure it turned out so much better that way, than if they had someone in a costume, or a completely CGI Beast. I am really tired of people complaining for the sake of complaining about the visuals. It is not real life, and never will be, it does not mean you can't enjoy the film. <br/><br/>Overall the movie was amazing! If you are a TRUE fan of this movie and have memorized every word to every song, like I have, you will love it and be inspired. I certainly am ignoring all the haters and enjoying my time in this magical world."

"brookenichole-98054","10","1","1","8 March 2020"," Brought me to tears
","Beauty and the Beast has always been my favorite Disney movie. I had just seen Harry Potter for the first time before this all came out and I loved Emma Watson. I had also just seen The Guest with Dan Stevens and loved him too. So, when the teaser came out and I saw Emma Watson's face in the glass I about died.
The acting was perfect for each role. You could really feel the emotions portrayed. Belle's anger and determination, the beasts frustration and infatuation with her. The fact that they both see the beauty in one another. Many of the side actors were fantastic too. Luke Evans really shined when he sang Kill the Beast. Josh Gad was hilarious too.
The music was as gorgeous as ever and Emma Watson isn't the best but she still had a pretty voice. My favorite song in the whole movie was Evermore. It was heartbreaking and powerful.
The CGI was great and the setting of each place was breathtaking. You felt thrown into the animated movie.
I means so much to me that they did this. The fact that everyone in the theater clapped shows how impactful it was. My heart was touched and brought so much nostalgia back."

All the characters were well-cast: Emma Watson as Belle was perfect and the Beast...he was amaziiiing. I loved his voice the most, deep and hoarse-so hot. The only teensy annoyance I have is when he turned back into a normal dude, he looked like a sixteen year old girl to me at first and it put me off. Other than that, this movie was beautiful!"
"wittkecmission","8","1","1","13 January 2020"," Be Our Guest. Again.
","There's no getting around it: Just like the Jungle Book, Beauty and the Beast is a carbon-copy of its animated predecessor. It has the same songs, the same dialogue, the same characters, and the same story. When you're watching a remake, odds are you're going to rate it lower than the original. But in this case, thank God, the remake is within the same class with the original. I have read The Jungle Book and was disappointed with its adaptations, which explains why I rated both movies pretty low. However, I don't know the original story of Beauty and the Beast, for I've never read the fairy tale. That's why I like these movies so much. Ignorance is bliss, but not rewarding. However, there is a drawback to this remake. When you animate, you create from scratch using the imagination, giving it a larger sense of artistry. But when you film, you merely record real life. That is why, compared to the 9/10 rating I gave the 1991 film, I'm giving this remake an 8/10.
P.S. Emma Watson's singing sounded heavily autotuned."

"jayjaycee","7","1","1","24 November 2019"," Hermione and the Beast
","""Beauty and the Beast"" is a 2017 musical romance directed by Bill Condon starring Emma Watson and Dan Stevens. Upon its release, I had mixed feelings about the idea of a live action remake of one of my favourite childhood films. We can all argue what's the point of a remake, but an adaptation that seems to be exactly like the original film? I can not deny that I still consider this one and the other remakes as unnecessary and money driven projects. But since yesterday was a promised movie night with my little sister and I don't have anything suitable for her in my shelf, she chose this one from her own. Honestly, it was not as bad as I expected. The biggest benefit from this movie is the pompous style and colorful costume design. The film crew literally managed to transfer the the magic and splendor of the animated flick on to the big screen. Additionally, every character was casted perfectly and as I expected, each and everyone delivered greatly. Next to this, I was glad that they still included the original songs. It's also notable that they also added a few new details to the tale as old as time, some derived from the original fairy tale, some completly new. Although it may not sound like it, the film also had a few flaws: The design of the beast appeared a bit to harmless to me and most of the most dramatic scenes of the original film (the wolves fighting scene, the showdown on the roof) lacked the emotional depth and dramatic essence they had before. I'm aware that they had to change it, because they targeted a younger audience and it would have been way to brutal to make it so packing, but I still think a little more tension would not have destroyed the concept. The visual effects and performances make it up a bit at least. All in all, this remake still might be unnecessary, but it's highly enjoyable for both, the young and the old generation, and delivers great fun from start to finish. It doesn't want to achieve anything else and was mostly made for a younger audience and as I saw my sister smiling the whole time, I knew that I was right. Watchable, but it definitely doesn't outshine the original."

A bit like Ewan McGregors French accent. The theme seems to be 'look how amazing our film is'. <br/><br/>I love Emma Watson but she's not a good Belle. She can't sing and doesn't have the punch that 1991 Belle had. The furniture, in trying to look realistic, is down right creepy, and let's not start on the CGI. <br/><br/>I do like that they've put in a bit of back story about Belles mother. But otherwise I'd recommend giving it a miss and watching the Live Action Cinderella instead"
"Aaron1375","5","1","1","24 September 2018"," I'll take the cartoon version thank you
","Disney has gotten on a kick of making live action versions of their classic cartoons, and why not? People are flocking to these things, so much so that this one made over 500 million in the US alone. Why come up with something original, when you can just redo the same thing and the people act like it is the best thing since sliced bread. Saves writers the trouble of being creative as you already have the basic structure of the story in place, just tweak it a bit and in this one they did not even bother to tweak it very much at all. Same movie essentially, but with a few added things here and there and a look that to me looks cheap. The beast looks good and some of the effects are alright, but it has a look of a movie that should have come on ABC as a special rather than a 150 plus budgeted movie meant for the big screen.<br/><br/>The story is essentially the same. A arrogant prince is cursed by some enchantress and turned into a hideous beast. The only way he can become human is if he can truly love and be loved by another. Enter Belle, played by Emma Watson. She is a odd one in the village as she just loves to read and everyone in town thinks she is quite the strange one. Of course, this does not stop town hunk, Gaston, from pining over her and wishing to make her his bride. Belle's father gets lost one night and ends up in the Beast's clutches and Belle finds him and takes his place and becomes the Beast's prisoner; however, soon the selfish Beast begins to feel for Belle and she for him. <br/><br/>I always thought Belle was one of the prettiest Disney princesses, so I am probably in the minority when I say, I thought Emma Watson was a horrible choice. She is so damn plain in the role as Belle and I have never understood why people think she is attractive at all. The rest of the cast is fine, I guess, but like I said, I just get a cheap television vibe when I watch this movie. About the only thing they really added that I thought worked was having Gaston be a bit more sinister in this one as he ties up Belle's father leaving him to the woods in this one. Makes one feel a bit better when he is killed than in the original where he was just a bit too eager to try and impress everyone and take out the Beast. He is more of an ass this go around and I think it works. They made his toady, Le Fou, gay in this one, and that works too. It makes more sense why he would keep wanting to hang around Gaston because he has a crush on him, himself. <br/><br/>So, this thing made money, another one, Maleficent also made money and several other live action ones have as well, so the trend will continue. Of course, I thought the choice for Aurora was horrible in that film too, they seem to want to pick zipper girls with no figures for these roles are plain janes. I guess it could be I am from a different generation and prefer a different look than the younger generation. I still say the film could be a reenactment in the Disneyworld theme park sans the scenes at Beast's castle though. Basically, give me the cartoon over this any day of the week."
"cyberjoshy-49579","3","1","1","13 August 2018"," Useless
","What a pointless and useless copy of the animated version of the same movie. Besides a few new songs nothing has been added or changed. Every character, line of dialogue or even the shots/camera angles comes from the animated version. 
On top of that i found this version of Belle very unsympathetic. Her change of heart over the beast was even more unbelievable than in the previous version. Same goes for the change of the beast. 1 moment he is a brute and the next he suddenly remembers his manners. 
If there was ever a prime example of what a cashgrab is, this movie is it."

I felt like this remake did not really bring new life to a story like a remake is supposed to; it just slapped a few new songs in there and called it good. I think that the whole live action Disney thing is a cash grab, but this isn't the time or place to discuss this... To be fair, there were things I did enjoy about this film. I thought the way they did some of the old songs like ""Be Our Guest"" and ""Tale as Old as Time"" were done very well. I also thought the film was visually pleasing and the costume/set design was whimsical. Overall, I think this as an average film that did not give justice to the original except for a few spots here and there."

","There are so many bad reviews for this film that I'm wondering if I saw the same film. I read all of the negative reviews and all I can say is, this is not the 1991 animated Disney version, GET OVER IT!
 I enjoyed this film and isn't that the point to get enjoyment? I think some of not all of these negative reviewers are just haters who before even seeing the film had their minds made up to trash it and then found ways to do it. Fiactorrstly, yes, I agree that Emma Watson was miscast. Her singing isn't horrible but it isn't up to par to be the heroine of a musical. Ewan MacGregor is a very good singer (see Moulin Rouge) but his version of Be Our Guest is a little flat compared to Jerry Orbach. In his defense, Jerry Orbach started out as a Broadway musical actor, MacGregor did not. That's a big pair of shoes to fill. His accent was not too bad which is one of the biggest complaints I saw. He sounded authentically French which is to not do a parody of Maurice Chevalier. This is what most actors do including what Jerry Orbach did.
 I thought Dan Stevens was good as the beast but the CGI make-up was a mistake, it would have been better to use traditional prosthetics. Josh Gad was very funny and stole most of the scenes he was in. The change in Gaston from conceited fool to conceited villain was also not a good change. Unlike most of the reviewers, I thought the CGI effects were good and really enjoyed what they did during Be Our Guest. Could the film have been better, perhaps, but it was not deserving of the horrible things people had to say about it. It certainly deserved better than 1 or 2 stars. If you don't believe me, look at the Metascore which is based on professional film critics. It is green and a fairly high score."

Be happy, enjoy what is good, prize reading and education, don't let the opinions of others influence or diminish your dreams. Also, find someone of good character, rather than just a pretty face.

"cutesd","3","1","1","10 March 2018"," Stiff, uneven, and preachy!
","I knew it was going to be bad when the film opened to a horrendously auto-tuned Emma Watson. Why ... when Hollywood is TEEMING with incredibly gifted actors who can both sing and dance ... do they insist time and again on casting actors ... in MUSICALS ... who can do neither? Maybe Emma looked the part of Belle ... but that's all she resembles in the character. She lacks the confidence, charisma, spark, and energy of the animated Belle and her vocals are downright puny. Luke Evans has the talent for Gaston, Josh Gad is fine as LeFou, Ian McGregor while not sounding French in the slightest at least has the vocal talent for Lumiere ... if they had to have Emma why not dub her over like they did for Audrey Hepburn in My Fair Lady?? <br/><br/>And then, I understand that Gaston is the narcissistic, brutish, mysoginist, obsessed and stalking Belle ... not taking ""no"" for an answer... he's the bad guy, I get it. And we the audience are shown why we should dislike him within his first 30 seconds on screen. But his first interaction with Belle is odd to say the least. He approaches her with a lovely bouquet of flowers, and politely asks her to dinner. She looks at him with a disgusted incredulous look and says ""no."" It's unclear whether this is the first time 1. she's met him or 2. he's asked her out. But if either of those things are true ... Belle was kinda b****y to the guy. I'm a woman, she's free to say no for whatever reason she wants, but if a guy brought me flowers and nicely asked me to dinner I'd at least attempt not to grimace. I know this guy's a jerk and he vows to keep pursuing her which is a total d**k move, but their first encounter doesn't give her any reason to be hostile, and even their second encounter feels like she's overreacting. The movie doesn't make me hate/loathe Gaston enough to want to see him treated badly ... which Belle does. And it makes me dislike her, not him.<br/><br/>Actually Emma feels stiff in the whole movie, it's almost like they bad cgi-d her to mimic realistic movements so everything looks unnatural.<br/><br/>And perhaps worst is Disney with their ham-fisted political messages. It's not enough for Belle to be the quirky odd-ball because she's smart and enjoys reading ... now she ALSO has to be an advocate for female equality and secretly teaching girls to read. An issue I totally agree with, but why does it have to be done so sanctimoniously and heavy-handed?<br/><br/>Belle's father stopping to get the rose was STUPID. You escape the wolves and the creepy possessed castle but then have to stop for a rose? I think your daughter would understand with your life and safety on the line if you forget her damned flower. Her dad deserved to get caught. And why they chose to cast Kevin Kline as Belle's father I really don't understand. He wasn't a crackpot scientist, he wasn't a zany kook, and he wasn't even that convincing as a loving father ... he wasn't endearing on any level.<br/><br/>The beast is too cartoony to be frightening, I'm sorry but Emma Thompson (whom I love) is just no Angela Lansbury. The beast's backstory was unnecessary melodramatic drivel. Belle's backstory was just depressing and made us lose focus from the primary story. The plot just meanders all over the place, it's an absolute mess and everything dilutes from the primary plot line so it loses all its potency by the end. <br/><br/>Some of the singing talent in this film is absolutely outstanding which only highlights how terrible the leads are. I don't understand why you'd need famous actors for roles that are 90% CGI ... why not get stronger vocal talent? It would have vastly improved the film.<br/><br/>There are some moments that are stunningly beautiful and proof of the magic that can be real-life vs animated films ... but they are few, far between, and never at the right moments. The musical numbers never even approach magical which is really disappointing as those were most of the high points in the animated version.<br/><br/>The crescendos all fall flat, the whole film feels anti-climactic. Nothing builds, there's no momentum. The pacing of the movie is all over the place, some parts way too slow and other things felt rushed. This film tries to distinguish itself from its animated predecessor but it's like Disney forgot that many consider Beauty and the Beast to be the best of all the animated Disney films.

","The animated film was a great film good animation, story, music and is considered one of the best Disney films. I must say it is a great movie. <br/><br/>I sat down to watch this remake with high hopes as Disney have been getting it right again in recent years. Well, it's a bit of a mess. There are lots of original scores which pleases me but I don't know what went wrong as they had no depth or pace. It really felt flat. This also goes for some of the acting. Emma Watson - well she just doesn't live up to being Belle, it's all a bit wooden. I also thought that the Beast (CGI mess) was also flat and wooden. The voice wasn't deep or gruff enough. Gaston - the actor actually did quite well but he is meant to be as big as a barge and arrogant. Again the actor didn't fit the bill. <br/><br/>It isn't a disaster as some are saying but it isn't the classic that is the 1991 animated film. It all feels too fake, too slow and too shallow. <br/><br/>Sorry Disney but you got it wrong with this one."
"SnoopyStyle","7","1","1","4 July 2017"," fine live-action take of Disney animated classic
","A selfish prince (Dan Stevens) lords over the local villagers. One rainy night, an old woman seeking shelter is sent away. She turns out to be an Enchantress. She curses the prince and his servants. He's turned into a Beast to be forgotten by the world. Belle (Emma Watson) is tired of the provincial life and the tiresome pursuing self-obsessed Gaston (Luke Evans). LeFou (Josh Gad) is his adoring man-servant. Belle asks for a rose from her traveling father. He takes a rose from the castle and is imprisoned by the Beast. Belle volunteers to take her father's place as the Beast's prisoner.<br/><br/>Emma Watson is a good actress. Her singing is average but that has its charms. Gaston is a great villain. The CGI looks good for the most part but I am uncertain about the Beast. Belle is a modern empowered character which does strike me as a little odd. It would help to have more scenes like the villager berating Belle for teaching the little girl to read. The more backwards the villagers, the better it is for Belle to rebel against. Then there is the basic prisoner love story at the core of this fairy tale. It remains problematic to me. There are ways to ameliorate this but the movie sticks to the story. This is good but the Disney animation remains the better."
"Mike_Devine","7","1","1","4 July 2017"," Disney revisits a tale as old as time
","Tale as old as time, or in the case of 'Beauty and the Beast,' 1991. After 26 years, Disney breathed new life into the animated classic in the form of a live action musical that starred the likes of Emma Watson as Belle and Dan Stevens as the famed beast.<br/><br/>The latest in a string of live action conversions of 2D animated pictures, 'Beauty' is nearly a carbon copy of the fan favorite, from the same songs and dialogue to nearly identical scene selections. While this is kind of eerie in one respect, it's kind of cool and respectable to see Disney pay homage in this way.<br/><br/>While Watson does a pretty good job, she does not exactly fit the part as well as a few other actresses probably could have (including Anna Kendrick or even Lily Collins). Still, she does a good job with her vocals and generally acting. Luke Evans is pretty spot-on as the boisterous Gaston, and Josh Gad adds a dose of humor as the dimwitted LeFou. For the rest of the cast, they are pretty much limited to being vocal actors, but still bring to life everyone from Cogsworth the clock (Ian McKellen) to Mrs. Potts (Emma Watson). And then there's Stevens as the prince-turned-beast himself, who fulfills the role quite nicely.<br/><br/>In this version of 'Beauty,' we get a little bit more backstory, which is helpful when it comes to character development. And while the film is mostly a vehicle for musical numbers, it doesn't come off exclusively as a musical in the way other recent similar films have. And for a film that is so dependent on CGI, it doesn't come off this way visually. The French countryside and the enchanted castle look and feel authentic, which is not something that can be said about many similar films.<br/><br/>Judging by its massive box office return and love among fans, it's fair to say 'Beauty and the Beast' is another example of why Disney will continue to give these stories a second wind. Expect 'Aladdin' and 'The Little Mermaid' to follow in the future."
"FelipeCarrillo","7","1","1","7 June 2017"," Must Walt Disney Studios Redraw Its Future?
","Disney presides over the current film scene in terms of money and art. The company founded by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks benefits from film studios with higher profitability on the market, which are the owner of retributive franchises such as ""Star Wars,"" ""Indiana Jones"", Pixar Animation Studios' works and the complete universe of Marvel Comics. The money amount it earns periodically with each of its proposals is unheard-of, either original ideas, those that turn to imagination without employing creative precedents, or remakes, audiovisual productions reproduces the narrative thread, the atmosphere in which the story runs, characters, and even pre-existing songs, in this case, from unreproducible animated classics.For a person who loves and understands film substance, it's dishonorable and enervating to see how celluloid world isn't being handled by creative artists, but by financial managers and accountants presiding artificial productions at box-office designs' expense, shelving true meaning of cinema. An archetype of this is the hybrid that I mentioned earlier, etymologically known as live- action. Hollywood executive's greed is derisory, greediness brazenly covers up under the shadow of hypothetical homages or reinventions for the audiences of the 20th century, those who have not had the opportunity to familiarize yourself with the likable unalterable animated characters and stories. However, we cannot declare that live-action feature films presented are strictly a way to make money, this is the hidden purpose, the released guinea pigs have been reasonably great. So this is where the final questioning emerges: must we pass unnoticed Disney's money desires if and only if it remains to offer audiovisual productions entirely well made, even if they continue to nurture the plague producing creative shortcomings nowadays? Judge for yourselves. <br/><br/>Imaginative impasse's last prey is ""Beauty and the Beast"", Disney's first movie in being nominated in six different categories at the Academy Awards, of which won two awards with reference to its unforgettable OST.The reinterpretation of the story of a prince transfigured int beast because of his arrogant conceit and his corresponding love affair with a villager who arrives his castle to rescue her father, examining enormous expectation set up months ago, is a modern contraption artistically uneven, it fulfills the objective of evoking the amazing inspiration source, at the same time develops more complex stories and plausible motivations, but using an almost integral copy. Although there's a patent female empowerment message, an unjustified noise for the first homosexual character of the company and places as meticulous as magnificent, it looks as if narrative were in unripe, and I don't mean the tale itself, since we already know it fully, I say this for autonomy lack with the basic story.<br/><br/>William ""Bill"" Condon (""Dreamgirls"" & ""Mr. Holmes"") does what he can with the tools on his property. We've had the pleasure of knowing Mr. Condon's aptitudes in sharply human films, the filmmaker exhibited his sensitive eye to portray fables with a dramatic base in these ones. The director will make to resurface briefly the charm of years ago with almost emulated camera shots, only altered by indescribable technological advances, however, the real magic keeps in the adorable animation from the 90s. The dance scene, 'Be Our Guest' musical number and the terminal moment will stimulate the awakening of memories supported by no ideal love and inner beauty, besides the rewarding minor variations to the soundtrack. Such immoderate fidelity allows it to touch both glory and failure at the same time. A recreation with less interest in the most circumstances, perhaps, it would have been better to get away from the original material a little more, just as Christophe Gans' dismal adaptation.<br/><br/>In respect of visual part, they had a laborious and delicate job, erect rightly Villeneuve, beast's gloomy palace or the tavern where LeFoe adulates Gaston with a song or make with extreme delicacy characters attire weren't easy. The filmmaking is objectively its specialty, keeping in mind narrative standards raised previously. Although Rococo style, CGI animations and clothing and make-up are fetching, that too dark effect prevailing in the third act is neither pleasant nor required. Fortunately, such chromatic attenuation doesn't discredit Belle's stunning yellow dress, the design of the sets and its animated characters or Emma Watson paying homage to ""Mary Poppins"" with her musical scene. Beautiful pictures.<br/><br/>If it had optimal challenges graphically, musically was impossible to get even an infinitesimal improvement, and effectively, impossible is impossible. Despite original composer (Alan Menken) returned to provide his services, none of his new scores are entirely predominant, however, the interpretation of the music classic in the voices of Ariana Grande and John Legend recalls melodic beauty from the original song.<br/><br/>The classic movie will remain a classic, but what would be a true modern classic falls short in charm. Exhausting run-time, Watson's overvaluation, the CGI technique in the face of the Beast of doubtful credibility, exaggerated darkness in the third act, and a few new forgettable songs complicate the goals of Disney about its winning streak. I've rated the film with reference to the original movie, since although they didn't want to alter or pass inspiration source, their attempt stays in a lax reinterpretation, as if Condon and his team wanted to draw frame by frame with beautiful elements which don't find who make them shine, and although in matter of adaptations, respectful similarity is what must prevail, it lacks magic. ""Beauty and the Beast"" (2017) is far from being a bad movie, nevertheless, they knew what and who they faced, and evidently failed to convince so big beasts."

","Of course we all know the plot, as the story has been around forever. This movie follows the story faithfully for the most part, but adds music, dancing, wonderful costumes, and some modern plot elements that to some may seem unusual, but are totally in keeping with reality in today's world. ""Reality"" seems an out of place word here where teacups and candelabra sing and dance, but the human (and beast) characters are well rounded and believable. Belle is strong without being overdone, Gaston is evil and leads others to be so also, but that, too, is an expression of today's world. The plot is as it always was and doesn't need explaining since we all pretty much know it already. A happy ending too, and that's as it should be. All in all an excellent movie for both adults and kids (7 or 8 years and up). No situations that would require embarrassing explanations, despite ridiculous claims by people who claim an ""agenda"". That's just silly. Go see it."

","I haven't written a review in a couple years, but seeing the negative reaction to this film, I had to act. <br/><br/>First of all, I watched the 3D version , it was magical to say the least. Secondly, I'm that millennial who loves Harry Potter so I would have a soft spot when it comes to Emma Watson. <br/><br/>You have to keep in mind this is a children movie, it's not supposed to be the next God Father. Also, it's kind of hard to make a movie when people already know the plot. They still managed to get that suspension at the end, even though everybody knows how it ends. <br/><br/>The movie is beautifully done. Scenes are like in a fairy tale as it should be. They spared no money on costumes. Decoration is breathtaking. Cast choice is appropriate. Music is beautiful.<br/><br/>I didn't have a problem with the Beast CGI. I thought it looked great! All the objects in the castle have a personality and they make you forget it's just CGI. <br/><br/>Emma Watson as Belle is the best choice in my opinion. She is stunning in the film and has done a great job being the outcast farmer girl. But again, I'm a fan so that may be a little skewed. <br/><br/>Most of the Disney princess movies have become classics that children often look up to. I wouldn't mind my children looking up to the Emma Watson Belle. <br/><br/>Bottom line: this movie keeps the original plot, at the same time provides us a beautiful display of choreography, charming music, fascinating scenery. <br/><br/>And most importantly, this movie provides us another classic Disney princess movie!"
"alanaawram","10","9","25","21 March 2017"," Spoiler free review of Beauty and the Beast. A beautiful film with incredible acting and mesmerizing visuals.
","Beauty and the Beast was an amazing movie. It was a great remake of the original animated version with extra added parts that only improved the story.<br/><br/>I have to admit, I did not have the highest hopes for this movie. I found the trailers looked alright, and decided to go see it after a few of my friends told me how good it was. I was stunned at how good it was.<br/><br/>I'll start with the visuals. The visuals were stunning. It was such a beautiful movie to watch, from the animation to shots of the castle, forest, and village. The costume design was spot on, as well as hair and makeup.<br/><br/>Next, the acting. Emma Watson was a perfect Belle. She was a strong female lead, smart, brave, and caring. She did such a good job of acting that I could only see her as Belle while I was watching the movie, despite having known her as Hermione for so long. Gaston was also spot on. He was the same arrogant character as we all remember. I thought that the Beast could have been a bit better at the start, but he improved throughout the film. I thought the other characters, such as LeFou and Maurice were very well done.<br/><br/>Now, the story. This movie follows the original story, while adding some more in to make it a deeper, better story in my opinion. We are given some backstory on the Beast and Belle. I find the way the plot unfolds is more believable than in the original. The relationship between Belle and the Beast seems a lot more genuine.<br/><br/>Finally, the music. I had my doubts about Emma Watson's singing capabilities, but I was blown away with how beautiful her voice sounded. The dance numbers are fun, with great choreography. Be Our Guest has some of the most beautiful animation. The songs from the original are there, along with some new ones that all together make an incredible soundtrack.<br/><br/>Overall, this was a beautiful movie and I suggest if you haven't seen it yet, to rush to the nearest theater and watch it."

For those of you who may be swayed by meta scores less than 8 (like myself), lets take it with a grain of salt. I've noticed a common theme of comparing this version with the original, which i think is unfair. I watched the original for the first time a few weeks ago. Forgive me, but i was not awed. I cant help but wonder if at least some of the low scores are based not on the superiority of the original, but the superiority of that time in these folks' lives -- nostalgia. Just a thought.

It has no life from beginning to end, the cartoon has 1,000 times for energy and livlyhood than the live action film! . Bell was mis cast. Emma Watson is the only one that has an English accent !!!??? The beast looks stupid and has a high pitch voice. Gesdon's side kick according to the director is "" expirmenting with gay feeling toward Gesdon"". Litterlly this film is garbage from start to finish. It's a joke.

"abisio","6","6","15","20 March 2017"," Another inferior remake of a very good movie
","People be advised; Disney industries are taking good old movies and remaking them in a cheap and fast way in order to extract new money out of older ideas. Recent Kong Island is a simple example. The movie is basically about half of Peter Jackson's King Kong version; but with lower productions values; minimum writing and barely no character definition (well Kong OK).<br/><br/>This Beauty and the Beast has most digital images than the animated version; so considering this more realistic is no more than a joke. I give that Emma Watson (out of Ermione) was a good choice; she is capable, has charisma and obviously is drawing a lot of kids to the movie (who loved her on the Harry Potter's series). The rest; however is forgettable.<br/><br/>Lumiere and Gaston steal the show as on the animated version; however while Chris Evans is able to do something with his character; Ewan Mc Gregor has not such luck since he is basically an animation that has a lot less to do than the original.<br/><br/>The lowest point is the ""Be my guest"" song; which was one of the highest achievement in the other version. The scene is confusing and not even nice to see. The ballroom scenes (another higher point of the original; nothing here).<br/><br/>There are a couple of new songs that add nothing new or interesting and a few changes on the characters like the unnecessary rewriting as LeFou as gay. I understand that Disney wants to run with times; but this was no more than a very lame (and offensive) comic relief.<br/><br/>I am not sure if Bill Condon (a sometimes good director ) was responsible or Disney executives did it; but this a cash cow that will make money but kill the flock.<br/><br/>In brief; get the animated version and forget this crap"

","I really don't understand all the negativity being aimed at this film. For me, this was Disney at it's best - whisking me away with great story, memorable tunes and that Disney magic.<br/><br/>Both my boyfriend and I left the cinema with huge grins and buzzing about what we had just seen - it took me back to my childhood when the only way to see Disney films was at the cinema and I revisited the magic I used to feel walking out after seeing The Jungle Book amongst others.<br/><br/>Be Our Guest is an amazing spectacle, the musical numbers are extravagant and I loved the extra plot included throughout the film - for me made it a more rounded story. If I was picky, I was expecting Beast to be a bit bigger and more intimidating, but that may have scared the younger audience.<br/><br/>If you want an exact replica of the animation, then you will be disappointed. But if you are after a film where you can lose yourself for just over 2 hours, get fully wrapped up in a classic story and both laugh and cry, then this is it. I loved the subtle humour. Well worth seeing in 3D and will be a definite purchase when eventually released on Blu-ray."

"NerdHuman123","10","7","19","19 March 2017"," Awesome remake with Disney magic and spellbinding visuals. Don't believe the bad reviews.
","Disney's live-action remake of the much loved classic animated film Beauty and the Beast lives up to the hype, and is just as good as, or possibly even better than the animated version. The story is the same, with enough new things in it to add something fresh. Most of the songs from the animated version are in the film, and sound quite similar to those in the animated version. All this makes viewers nostalgic for the old film. The acting is what one would expect from such a huge cast. Luke Evans as Gaston and Josh Gad as LeFou are especially spectacular, as they add humor to their already well developed characters. As I already mentioned, the songs and the music are great, and live up to Disney standards. The cinematography is also great, with long sweeping shots during the musical sequences. The shots of the setting and of the castle are also amazing. What really impressed me about this movie though is the costumes, the sets, the castle, and the general look of the film. Wow wow wow applause clap clap clap!!! No description of mine can do justice to the amazing design and the spectacular use of CGI. I was worried about what the beast and the objects in the castle might look like in a live-action movie, but Disney did a very good job of not just making it work, but making it amazing. Another thing about this version of Beauty and the Beast that I loved was that there's a homosexual character! In a Disney princess movie with a lot of clichÃ©s in it, it's awesome to see some diversity. <br/><br/>Disney's remake of Beauty and the Beast will make fans of the animated classic nostalgic. It will delight a new generation of children. I wouldn't recommend bringing really young children to see it though, as there is some violence and things that may spoil your child's innocence. The movie is very enjoyable for teens and adults as well. However, if you don't like the animated classic, you will not enjoy this movie. If you don't like classic fairy tales featuring princes and castles, don't see this movie. If you hate musicals, don't see this movie. See this movie for the Disney charm, the nostalgia for the animated version, the music, and the amazing visuals. I would highly recommend seeing Beauty and the Beast in the cinema, possibly in 3D."
"Powderhorn","9","7","19","18 March 2017"," An Outstanding Piece of Work!

A ten is not deserved for some slightly odd CGI regarding the Beast. Other than that, the movie enchants me, and I will see again and again.<br/><br/>As for the critics that complain about the ""gay"" scenes. Bah! There's hardly a thing there. You might not even notice if you weren't looking. Kids certainly won't know to what the very subtle innuendos tangentially point.

"mark-durfor","9","7","19","17 March 2017"," Beauty and the Beast comes to life
","Disney has done it again. We all know the story. It's a ""tale as old as time"". We all know the formula by now. Disney is taking their classic movies and re-making, re-imagining, recreating them (whatever you want to call it) as live-action movies. In 2010, Tim Burton and Disney brought the live-action version of Alice in Wonderland with Johnny Depp to the big screen. Maleficent followed in 2014 starring Angelina Jolie re-telling the story of Sleeping Beauty. Next was Cinderella in 2015 and 2016 gave us Pete's Dragon and The Jungle Book. Now, Emma Watson reprises the role of Belle in Beauty and the Beast. Disney's original groundbreaking animated masterpiece was released in November 1991. It was nominated for Best Picture of the Year, the first of only 3 animated movies to ever be nominated for Best Picture.<br/><br/>The preview for Beauty and the Beast looked breathtakingly beautiful. There is so much to show in so little time, so they don't really waste any of it trying to summarize the plot like they do in most previews, assuming you already know the story. Instead, you are given little gems. A glimpse of the Beast that looks like Disney's original animation come to life. Brief shots of our favorite characters: Chip, Mrs. Potts (Emma Thompson), Cogsworth (Ian McKellen) and Lumiere (Ewan McGregor). Emma Watson as Belle, who may not be the obvious choice, but looked in the preview to pull off the role quite well, and she does a fantastic job. The CGI that looked like it would hold its own against Disney's latest reinvention of The Jungle Book that just won an Oscar for Best Visual Effects. And some of the familiar music that made the first so special.<br/><br/>I had extremely high expectations for Beauty and the Beast, but there were a few things that I felt would have to be nailed for this to be perfect. Belle. As I just said, Watson doesn't immediately stand out as the obvious choice for the role. She looked great in the preview, but I wondered if she could hold it with the intelligence, grace, bravery, strength and singing required to match her predecessor's performance. She did. In fact, after seeing her performance and hearing her voice mastering so many iconic songs, I don't know that I could imagine anyone else in the role.<br/><br/>I also felt that the animation needed to be flawless. This film had two previous movies to live up to: the original animated version from 1991 that was nominated for Best Picture and the 2016 Jungle Book. Many of the critiques I've read about Beauty and the Beast criticized the CGI, specifically the Beast. They say his eyes are off and the characters are flat. I disagree and wonder if they didn't understand the difference in story-telling between Jungle Book and Beauty and the Beast. Jungle Book was supposed to be much more realistic, aside from talking animals. It wasn't a fantasy world, it wasn't a dream, it was a man-child in the jungle with real animals. Beauty and the Beast is fantasy, a place of Belle's dreams and others' nightmares. A Prince turned into a hideous beast. Servants turned into a candlestick, a clock, a dresser, a teapot and cup. Of course the animation is going to look different. Now, that being said, there were a couple moments with Beast walking that were slightly less perfect than his animation for the rest of the movie. However, the human characters' interactions with the animated ones were seamless.<br/><br/>The music. Jungle Book didn't hold back with their musical numbers and I hoped that Beast wouldn't either. They didn't. In fact, we were introduced to a few new songs written just for this live-action version of the classic. We get to see the history of the Prince and why he became such a selfish man. We also got to see what happened to Belle's mother and what drove her father from Paris when she was just a baby. Though they didn't have the same catchy lyrics that will have kids and adults singing for 16 years to come, they fit right in with the story and were welcomed additions to the film.<br/><br/>And finally, the ballroom scene. The sweeping shot of the chandelier in the grand ballroom with Belle in her yellow dress and Beast in his blue suit was nothing short of iconic and groundbreaking in the original animation. It's a lot to live up to. They went a slightly different route with the ballroom scene. Instead of one central chandelier, they had several in the room and the sweeping shot around the room revealed instruments on the wall helping to orchestrate their dance. My only criticism of that scene was that the original shone so bright and golden and this version, although beautiful, was a little muted.<br/><br/>Beauty and the Beast had a lot to live up to, and the preview made it look like they were up to the task. So I gave it a very enthusiastic and hopeful 4.5 Star Prediction. After watching the movie, I believe they were very successful in paying tribute to the original while making decisions to set their live action version apart and modern-ish for 2017. I enjoyed it completely and thought it nearly perfect except for my few minor criticisms. So I'm sticking with my 4.5 Star rating. marksmoviemind.blogspot.com"

We hated pretty much everything about this movie: the new songs, the changes to the original lyrics, most of the CGI, most of the casting, the direction, the script (which tried to fix what wasn't broken)... Everything. The Gaston in this version is a lightweight compared to the terrifyingly sadistic version in the original. This one is just inconsistently written, self- absorbed, and a bit bipolar, but not really scary. The story line about her Mom was a total waste and unnecessary; the village was way too idyllic; the pacing uneven; and there were too many what the heck moments. The whole film didn't really flow at all, and was incredibly disjointed. One of the worst movies we've ever seen, and we typically like or love Disney movies. Oh and the use of auto-tune in this film totally ruined the singing and grated on our nerves. Plus the lip syncing was blatantly obvious, which is really bad for a musical. All in all, this represents a case study in how not to adapt source material."

","Pros: Emma Watson is pretty and Kevin Kline is a great actor. Gaston was funny.<br/><br/>Cons: Emma Watson is an underwhelming singer, a disengaged actress, and British. She's not a bad actress, but not right as Belle. It called for a Julie Andrews-type energy. <br/><br/>The other problem, and it's only a problem because you can't suspend your disbelief that there are so many black people in 18th century France. It looks like a high school play with ""whoever we can get"" to fill the roles, including Emma Watson. <br/><br/>The 1991 version was better in every way except casting Americans as French is somehow worse than casting Brits."

The casting was great and well it was far better than I expected. It was captivating and the story kept us bonded. It had a very happy ending ,in all it was fun.<br/><br/>I don't know why many others hate it but give it a chance. Not only did it bring the animated movie to life but also added some little more background. The movie deserves more."
"masadler","1","4","9","13 June 2017"," An utter disappointment
","Kevin Kline is as good as usual; the screenplay is mostly the original so the film has a good start but the acting of Emma Watson was flat, uninspired and unconvincing. The set designs and CG were cleanly done and probably the best part of the film. Luke Evans also provided a good, even excellent, Gaston. But, I would rather watch the animated version (or better yet, read the book). And please please please never let Emma Watson sing again!<br/><br/>So far, my vote for the worst film of 2017."

"amycohrs","9","4","9","23 April 2017"," Improvement on the Cartoon Version
","As much as I love the cartoon version of this movie from my childhood, it is full of plot holes and unanswered questions. The new Beauty and the Beast did a great job addressing the plot holes, giving all the characters more depth, and expanding on secondary stories. I appreciate the detail and thought that went into the scenery and animated characters. They conveyed the desperation of the cursed castle staff by having their faces look less like people and more like the objects they were turned into. They are essentially dying and very close to losing their remaining human characteristics. They clearly steered more toward progressive moral themes. The cast was more culturally diverse, La Fou and another villager are (albeit subtly) gay, and they better emphasized Belle's positive traits despite adversity and social rejection. I think they chose Emma Watson to get away from the Disney princess stereotype. Don't listen to other reviewers. Go see it, and don't go in expecting to see the old cartoon version."

"bxhancock","9","4","9","12 April 2017"," Middle Age Fat Guy Likes It.
","OK, so I'm a middle aged fat guy, former soldier and retired cop. Hard ass never liked musicals in my life. I couldn't stand ""Oklahoma"", ""West Side Story"", ""Guys and Dolls"", etc and I'm a HUGE classic movie buff. Loved the ones NOT musicals and absolutely refused to give any Disney musical even a chance at entertaining me. If it was guns, explosions, hot chicks in Daisy Dukes, I was all for it. I loved the ones like ""Marty"", ""On The Water Front"", ""Casablanca"", etc. Still wasn't going to watch a musical.<br/><br/>Then this movie came out and I saw the previews. I found myself watching the previews every time I came to IMDb to write about some subject. It slowly started creeping into my conscience. All I knew is it had that little girl from the Harry Potter movies that my boys so loved growing up.<br/><br/>Then I heard her sing and it grabbed me by the heart. This last Christmas I spent with the Moscow ballet and so I was already into ballet and music. Just not musicals but her singing had me telling my wife, ""We're going to see that when it comes out."" I've literally seen thousands of movies in my life. I used to work at a cinema. I can tell you the movies that I have actually paid to see at the theater more than once: ""Star Wars (original)"".... ""Terminator""....""Spaceballs""... ""Unforgiven"".... ""Schindler's List""... ""Saving Private Ryan""..... ""Beauty and the Beast"". I don't care about Oscar winning movies. I watch them because if someone asks about them, I'll actually know what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>I'm not gay but I watched ""Brokeback Mountain"" just so I could tell people that they were full of bulls**** when they trashed it. People never saw it and just drove it into the ground. When it came to BATB, I heard people passively talking about it as, ""Just another Disney musical that we might take the kids to see."" 50 years old.. 250 lbs retired soldier and police officer... Has testicles firmly in place.. Married... Kids are grown and living in the world... I look like a cross between Tom Arnold and Alfred E. Newman..... and I not only paid twice to see it, I'm going to take my wife and watch it a third time tomorrow.<br/><br/>I can tell you the CGI/Human interaction is incredibly detailed and perfect. All of the characters bring energy to the story in their own way. The casting was damn near as perfect as you can get in a movie of this scale, requiring so much talent. The acting was believable, the singing was encompassing and vibrated your heart. I kept waiting for a ""slow"" part so I could run to the restroom. The movie never slowed down a bit. It kept going right along, smooth transition from scene to scene, the music keeping you involved. I was enthralled.<br/><br/>Go see it. If you need a middle aged fat guy to go with you so people don't think that you're a creeper, call me. I've seen it alone and you do get strange looks. But it's worth the strange looks.<br/><br/>I hope you do go see the movie and I hope that you enjoy it.<br/><br/>Bill"
"CinematicInceptions","5","4","9","9 April 2017"," A waste
","Despite the great amount of work that went into this remake, I am having a hard time seeing as anything but a cash grab. The story really lent itself better as a cartoon. It's a story wants to be friendly and light-hearted with talking furniture characters that seem more like people than actual furniture. It seemed like attempts were made to give it the same endearing qualities as the cartoon like the Be Our Guest number and the playful furniture characters, but these did not blend well with the dark color scheme, making the castle in complete disrepair and in a perpetual winter, and other attempts at heightened drama.<br/><br/>There are a number of reasons for re-making a movie, but I really don't think this one was warranted. The primary issue with re-making this particular Disney classic is that the original movie was pretty good. I do not get the sense that any Disney fans wanted to see a live-action reboot, and the cartoon only came out about 25 years ago and does not feel like an old movie yet. Also, there was nothing terribly new that was brought to the story. There were a couple new elements, namely a subplot involving Belle finding out how her mother died and the notion that the majority of the village is gullible and unintelligent, but none of these things contributed in any way to the larger story. On the whole it was the same movie done in CGI and green screen sets instead of cartoon.<br/><br/>In a theme and plot sense it was quite clunky. The cutting between the different plot lines and characters did not feel well-timed to me, and perhaps if I cared to look back at the exact sequence of the movie I would know why. The main thematic point of the movie seemed to be missed a bit. What makes Beauty and the Beast a ""tale as old as time"" is that it's the story of one person bringing out the kindness in another and proving that anyone can rise above their external ugliness with inner goodness. The scenes in which Belle and the Beast grow closer to each other were, in my opinion, the best in the movie; but I feel like there should have been one or two more of them so that their relationship was stronger by the time they had to part ways. Having a bunch of the villagers be connected to the servants of the castle was just another forced and unnecessary element to cap it off.<br/><br/>I was not at all impressed with the distribution of acting talent. None of the actors did a bad job, but lower-caliber actors could have delivered equally good performances. In that light, hiring such a star-studded cast seems like it was just a way to get more money. However, I must say that Luke Evans and Josh Gad made a good Gaston and LeFou duo. This was diminished to a degree by nearly everything that LeFou did or said point not so subtly to his being gay. Having a Disney movie feature a gay character is fine at face value, but I don't think they pulled it off well here.<br/><br/>Overall, I cannot recommend seeing this. There is nothing here that is better than the original cartoon, even in a visual sense. I went to see it because I was curious to see how Disney would reinterpret a classic story, but there was not much to see. If this is how the upcoming line of Disney re-makes are going to be, I will not bother seeing them because the people in charge of the story do not seem to care about making a quality movie. Overall Rating: 6.2/10"
"lauravalerietaylor","5","4","9","6 April 2017"," Mixed Feelings
","Before I start this review, I have to preface it by saying that I am a huge fan of the Disney version that was released in the 90's, so that may have had a bearing on what I thought of this one.<br/><br/>I have nothing against Emma Watson, and though I've never seen her in anything else so I can't testify to her acting ability, I thought she was totally wrong for the part of Belle. She seemed to have only two facial expressions: ""Something stinks,"" and ""Something stinks, but I'm going to smile through it anyway."" Some of the most emotional scenes lacked the power to move me because I couldn't get past how bland she was.<br/><br/>Something that really bugged me was the quality of the CGI. It wasn't just the enchanted castle staff, either, although seeing them brought to life from their cartoon form was a bit jarring and creepy at times. I was sorely disappointed in the appearance of the Beast. It seemed to me that they tried to make him look too much like the cartoon version, and it didn't translate well into a real-life CGI look. All I could think about every time he was in a scene was how off he looked, so much so that it was distracting.<br/><br/>There were some things I really enjoyed, like the fact that they kept the original songs and even added some new ones. The ""Be Our Guest"" sequence was particularly gorgeous, and I thought they did a fabulous job bringing that scene to life.<br/><br/>I like that they explained some things that weren't explained in the earlier cartoon version (like what happened to Belle's mother, why they left Paris, why the Prince was so awful in his prior human life, and why no one seemed to remember the castle and its inhabitants). Luke Evans was brilliant as Gaston, and they couldn't have picked a better LeFou than Josh Gad. The rest of the all-star cast (including Stanley Tucci, Ewan McGregor, Ian McKellen, and Emma Thompson, just to name a few) were outstanding in their roles as usual, but I do feel like Kevin Kline was underused just a bit as Maurice.<br/><br/>In all, it was a decent movie. Because my expectations were high, I was a bit disappointed, and I can't say that it's one I feel like I need to see again or add to my collection. But if you're looking to be entertained and dip a toe into nostalgic feelings, you'd probably enjoy it."

","The Disney hit machine is in full effect with a live action remake of ""Beauty And The Beast"" starring Emma Watson as Belle and Dan Stevens as the Beast.<br/><br/>For those rare few who are unfamiliar with the story, Stevens is an unkind, selfish prince who angered a witch who cursed him to live out his days as a hideous beast unless he falls in love with someone who also falls in love with him. Stevens' palace staff were also cursed, turning into clocks, dressers, candelabras, etc. Enter Watson's father, who picks a flower from Stevens' palace grounds to give as a gift to Watson; and Stevens imprisons him for theft! Watson, being the loving daughter, takes her father's place as a prisoner. What follows is a very rocky start, to say the least, to an unlikely romance between a beautiful, young lady and a monstrous-looking creature who has much love and kindness hidden deep in his soul, just waiting to be drawn out by the right woman.<br/><br/>But Stevens is on the clock: the witch has given him a rose, and when the last petal falls and Stevens has not met anyone who he has fallen in love with and loves him in return, Stevens and his staff will remain as they are forever.<br/><br/>My most memorable, movie moment of ""Beauty And The Beast"" is the scene when Watson and Stevens, all dressed up, dance together for the first time, and the song with the same title as the movie is sung by a tea kettle.<br/><br/>It's been over a decade since I watched the animated version, so I was able to judge this iteration without being prejudiced by its predecessor. The acting was good, the sets (practical and CGI) were lavish and bright to give hints as to its animated lineage, many characters were memorable and larger than life, and the musical numbers were simply amazingI felt like I was watching an opera, that's how intricate and beautiful many of the grander, musical pieces were. This movie is a must-see for any Disney movie fan.<br/><br/>Mannysmemorablemoviemoments"

","Contrary to the idiots who think this should be a different story than the animated version, I actually preferred they stuck to the original as much as possible. Some minor differences that really do not affect the outcome. But the acting is first class. So is the music, the singing and the tempo. And it's amazing how well something that even in animation is difficult to imagine can be so well done with the modern CGI techniques! Once again well done, Disney. And please ignore the naysayers. This is definitely worth watching and proof was the theater was packed and all the children got out singing and loved it! Saw the 3D and I'm watching the 2D tomorrow with the wife. Yes, THAT good!"
"Troy_Campbell","8","4","9","24 March 2017"," A visually stunning and musically catchy live-action remake.
","A tale as old as time, this Disney animated classic gets a live-action makeover complete with singing candelabras, a crumbling castle, and a cantankerous brute doomed to live out his days in solitude and regret. That is, until the weird and wonderful village bookworm Belle (Emma Watson) brings a slice of humanity into the creature's cursed world. But can this Beauty tame the Beast? We all know how the story plays out yet that does nothing to dampen the exuberance and splendour on display; each song and dance sequence is a feast of stunning cinematography, fascinating choreography and catchy tunes. And the recognisable theme song is, of course, still amazing. Musical numbers alone, however, will only take the movie so far, so it's credit to the cast that they imbue proceedings with an additional layer of heart, humour and interest. Watson is simply delightful as the strong-willed and resourceful Belle, Dan Stevens is complex as the motion-captured Beast, Luke Evans and Josh Gad are comically over-the-top as Gaston and LeFou, and Ewan McGregor almost steals the show entirely as the rambunctious Lumiere. There's a couple of missteps blocking this remake's lofty ambition of matching the original—the runtime is slightly too long, the sweeping shots of the castle become repetitive—although it gets enviably close. A charming tale of romance and redemption, Beauty and the Beast dazzles with visual opulence and irrepressible musical energy."
"cgrill8","7","4","9","23 March 2017"," E Gad... could have been SO much better...
","The movie was great. The score was a wonderful mixture of the original tunes plus 3 new tunes as well, but no ""Only Human"" figure that one out. The cast was brilliantly picked, though Belle came off a bit stiff from time to time. The effects looked great, most of the time. Now my main complaint. Gad. Why. Why do they continue to hire this guy? He wasn't very funny in The Comedians. I couldn't stand his character in Angry Birds. The butt jokes in Frozen, and then we saw his dairy rotund and crack in Pixels with his antics in that movie (which would have been better without that actor...) And then they use him like a bad Kleenex in this film. Can we just stop hiring Josh Gad. He embarrasses the parents that try to take kids to a decent movie... every time. Beauty & the Beast was wonderful, but would have been so much better without Josh Gad. He ruins every movie his mug shows up in. Secret hidden Disney agenda or just continued hiring of a bad/disgusting actor over and over?"

","You can have many opinions about movie remakes. It is true, that many times remakes are stupid and vain and many times they flop simply because of their contradiction in terms. So is Beauty and the Beast remake legitimate? Absolutely yes. Movie is a thoroughbred true musical and many musicals are very populated in theaters all around the word and people travel to see them in many theater cities around the world. There is no reason why we can't enjoy the new version of Beauty and the Beast. With the new technology movie has brought back so beautifully. It's legendary themes sounds so lovely and familiar, that even new generation can enjoy it's magic and luxury. Also the movie characters are now more profound and therefore more interesting even for more adult audience. Beauty and the Beast takes it's audience from very beginning to it's magical world and entertains it's whole audience. Movie follows almost exactly the original movie concept. Most of the time it works, but not all the time. Especially at the middle of the movie ""Be my Guest"" song is little too blurry and childish and could be replaced with better scene. That doesn't bother too much and movie maintains it's magic.<br/><br/>Emma Watson as Belle manages her role very well and surprises with her talent to sing. Dan Stevens has make-up almost unrecognizable, but digitally created monsters face and eyes are brought to screen so lively and humanly as possible. Strong story, great characters and Alan Menken's score is so beautiful watch and hear, that it sensitize even strongest viewer. Remake of Beauty and the Beast is very well done update of original Disney classic.<br/><br/>Tale as old as time True as it can be Barely even friends Then somebody bends Unexpectedly Just a little change Small to say the least Both a little scared Neither one prepared Beauty and the beast"

","I came on here to rate this film and was shocked at the amount of negative reviews that this film has. I rated it 10 out of 10 purely because it's a truly magical film. <br/><br/>I love Disney and always have done, and I was a little apprehensive to see this in case it ruined the magic of the original. However I was enthralled from start to finish. After the initial shock of seeing Hermione singing (HP super fan here), I was transported for two hours into a brilliant, light hearted, funny and entertaining film. It's beautiful, a little sad near the end but overall I left the cinema with a big smile on my face. <br/><br/>This is definitely a film for all ages. If you haven't seen it yet, go and see it! Some people on here are so negative about the CGI and all the effects, but it is a Disney musical film intended for kids and loved by all ages. There's more important things (in my eyes) that the effects... after all isn't that the moral of the story! Don't judge something by its looks alone."
"mwcrunner","10","8","23","24 March 2017"," Great adaption of the original classic
","Beautiful. Simply beautiful. Emma Watson is fantastic as Belle in this and Dan Stevens makes a great Beast in this. Plus this is better then the original animated version cause it has some backstory to it. It shows why Prince Adam was selfish and unkind and it was because of his father. After Prince Adams mother had died, his father who was cruel and selfish treated him like dirt and raised him to be just like him. When Prince Adam was transformed into the Beast he blamed his father for his pain. Yep definitely a better backstory then the other one in the original animated version. It also shows Belle's backstory of when her mother had died. She had the plague and the doctors took infant Belle away so that she would be safe from the plagues harm. Her mother however didn't make it and went to Heaven. Also Gaston is the same as he is in the original, except he leaves Maurice to be eaten by wolves and shoots the Beast 3 times with a pistol instead of stabbing him with a dagger and shooting him with an arrow. He didn't even think about using his rifle in the original film. lol. It's also nice to see the enchantress throughout this film instead of the original cause in the original she is only shown at the beginning. It also has great brand new songs and the old ones from the original film, like Evermore, Be Our Guest, Gaston, and of course everyone's favorite the title song. Yep this indeed a beautiful masterpiece Disney has to offer. 10 out of 10."

","This movie was completely unnecessary. It does everything from the original animated film but in a bland and boring way.

"nogodnomasters","10","3","6","23 July 2017"," Take a Second Look. Men Change.
","I believe we all know the plot of Disney's benign story of bestiality and Stockholm Syndrome. This particular production adds details to the story and creates a subplot with Maurice (Kevin Kline) the father of Belle (Emma Watson). The production includes a Rapunzel Tower, Cinderella dress and talking inanimate objects and Snow White's magic mirror.<br/><br/>The film has many musical numbers, assuring numerous Globe and Oscar nominations. Emma Watson did sing and did so very well, clearly having some voice training. When she was on a hill having a Julie Andrews reminiscent moment, it was clear she could not hit and hold the high note, nor did she try. Her voice was soothing and pleasing. She stayed within her limitations which made her sound better than recent Oscar winner, Emma Stone. Emma Watson is frequently voted as one of the top beautiful women in the world, however in this film she loved books and shared an intellect with the Beast (Dan Stevens). She was bold and daring, as women have left the princess role into one that is more asserting, reflective of our era. The film takes place in pre-revolution France, the part of France that speaks mostly English sometimes with or without an accent.<br/><br/>There is some concern over Disney's first ""openly gay"" character, discounting the fact Donald wore a sailor's outfit and kept running away from Daisy. LeFou (Josh Gad) was ""Tim Curry"" flamboyant. He has a heavy bromance with antagonist Gaston (Luke Evans) and is asked why he has never married. Near the end we see LeFou ballroom dancing with another man for a few frames.<br/><br/>Uplifting feel good quality film I would watch again."

"Tweetienator","4","3","6","17 May 2017"," The Rich & Ugly
","I read a fine comment on the story of The Beauty and the Beast - that the moral boiled down leaves us with the conclusion that ""if you are rich you can be ugly but you can still get married to a beautiful woman"". Well, if I would have a hang to be a conspiracy theorist I would argue that the story was invented - or more likely commissioned - by ugly, old rich men to teach women that ""the beauty lies within"" ;)<br/><br/>Anyway, after I have now filled some lines required back to the movie - this version of The Beauty and the Beast feels like La La Land to me: not really bad but far away from being an outstanding or a new classic. If you like musicals you may watch it, if you don't watch it you won't miss much. Music, setting, directing, acting, everything okayish. If I would have to use one word for labeling the movie, that's it: okayish.<br/><br/>Conclusion: the best Disney movies are still animations. On the other fields, be it Star Wars, Johnny Depp's pirating or Mad Hatting, or this movie, the outputs are mediocre, predictable - redundant. Frozen for example easy beats imho everything Disney produced recently with real actors and you have the advantage that you can give a real singer's voices to the animated characters, my wish: for the next couple of years, no more actors singing, let them act and not bore me to hell - if I wanna hear an amateur's voice I take a shower ;) Next."
"LKay865","7","3","6","13 April 2017"," Enjoyable, but with a few pressing issues...
","With Beauty & the Beast being one of my all time favourite animated Disney movies, I was so excited for a very long time for the live action film to come out. When I went to the cinema to watch it I could barely contain myself!<br/><br/>The film itself is enjoyable. The plot stays very much to the original with a few changes, such as a bit more back story for Belle and Beast, and Maurice not being an inventor (why? I'm not really sure). The back stories were intriguing, however I felt that they did not really add much to the film or plot, and felt like they were almost thrown in there as a last minute thing to fill in screen time. <br/><br/>I feel I need to talk about the musical numbers in the film. A lot of them were fabulous, Be Our Guest was hugely pleasing both aesthetically and acoustically, and Gaston was brilliant - along with Josh Gad and Luke Evans really being the highlight of the cast in general for me. Belle (the song in the village) was done quite well, however Emma Watson's singing voice generally throughout the film is rather flat and uninspiring compared to Paige O'Hara's performance in the 1991 version... plus some of the autotuning particularly in this number was so glaringly obvious it was almost laughable. Something There was a big let down for me... it really lacked the fun and intrigue of the original. Beauty & the Beast was lovely and I really enjoyed it, though it probably will still never compare to Angela Lansbury for me! <br/><br/>The musical score in general is fabulously put together and arranged. There were a couple of new numbers put in, all of which I liked except for the Beast's song 'Evermore' which I felt was just awfully written and really did not capture the Beast's doom and heartbreak at that point in the film. <br/><br/>The acting is generally okay... As I say, Luke Evans and Josh Gad were really the highlights of the cast for me. Emma Watson is beautiful and could have added so much more magic to the role of Belle - however, it just felt to me that she was literally just reading the script, and following the director to the point where she was not adding any of her own flare to the part; it all feels very stiff and wooden. Dan Stevens as the Beast was good enough, however unfortunately this is marred by the design and appearance of the Beast, which is really truly quite awful for a 2017 release with such a huge budget for special effects and CGI - which as other reviewers have stated, is quite distracting - same with the wolves... especially after such breath taking CGI and visuals in The Jungle Book. <br/><br/>The castle staff were all pleasant enough (except for Chip, I don't know who did the casting for him but that kid can't act at all), and contrary to some others' opinion, I though the CGI on them was quite good. Kevin Kline did a great job as Maurice and I really enjoyed his performance. <br/><br/>Overall, a pleasant watch and I did enjoy the film. I just feel that it could have had more done to inject some real magic, like the original, into the mix."

For transforming an animation movie to a reality is by itself a hard work to be as exactly identical, since animations are animations and imaginary. I believe that the movie was made at its best and won't be done better. It's true that in some scenes the act was a bit shallow and vague, but if you look at the scene from a realistic perspective rather than exactly copying the scenes in your mind and comparing it to the animation, then you will simply love and appreciate this movie. In the end, believe me, you will leave from this movie clapping and filled with joy, happiness and love. <br/><br/>A MUST WATCH for Disney lovers !!!"

","Just saw this and wow all I can say is wow! I know people have their views on these Disney live action films but people need to realize that Disney knows these films will never ever be like the animated versions. But, in my opinion I love this just as much as the animated version. There was such magic and wonder and adventure in this film!! Emma really shows so much heart and strength to this role and she really is Belle! All of the other characters are so great as well!! I got goosebumps to the core when I saw this and I wanna see it again! :) Emma gives so much to her role as Belle and she is so strong but can also have a quiet confidence to her. She is everything you love about Belle and more and I think her singing voice is so pretty and Dan Stevens voice as the beast is so great and his song evermore that he sings is so beautiful!"
"kayleighlaylaparker","9","6","16","21 March 2017"," A beautiful adaptation of the tale as old as time
","I went into this film with low expectations. Beauty and the Beast was one of my favourite Disney films as a child and I really connected to the character of Belle (the brunette with brains).<br/><br/>Fortunately, I was incredibly impressed. Although typically I find Emma Watson wooden and self-conscious as an actress, she did redeem herself as the film went on, with her sweetness and gusto. She's the perfect Belle; a natural beauty. It was refreshing to see an actress portray Belle with no Hollywood tweaks, surgery or artifice. Watson was born to play the role and I cannot think of another popular actress who could be Belle.<br/><br/>Luke Evans as Gaston - well, what can be said. He EMBODIED this role and brought life to the character. Lefou was also interpreted in a refreshing way.<br/><br/>There were a few craws that stuck. It was obvious that Disney was trying to pander to the #oscarssowhite crowd by randomly peppering the cast with black actors and actresses. In other films, this would be fine, but Beauty and the Beast is a classic fairy tale, and it seemed obvious that black actors were added to appease the baying mob. No Asian, Latino or Native American actors for instance...I wonder why (sarcasm off). This tendency to shoehorn diversity into a project felt pandering and inappropriate and even took me slightly out of the film (yes, I know it's a film with talking cutlery and a beast but still...) Yes, the beast was CGI'd but this didn't bother me at all. I felt the beast and Emma had a believable connection as they slowly fell in love.<br/><br/>All in all, I was moved by this magical story and feel reconnected to my inner child.<br/><br/>A must watch for children (and big children) of all ages."
"dmartinez-52655","9","6","16","20 March 2017"," Phenomenal
","""Beauty and The Beast"" is a Live-Action Disney Adaptation of the beloved 90's Disney classic Animated Movie of the same name based on the French Fairy tale ""La Belle et la Bête"" in the 1700's. The Original Disney Movie is a timeless movie that is now another Disney Live- Adaption along with Cinderella, Jungle Book, and Pete's Dragon. The Movie is Directed by Bill Condon, the same mad man who directed a couple of Twilight movies, well my expectations just flew out the roof! But this is a movie review, so let's talk about the movie, it's pretty good. Beauty and the Beast follows most of the original Disney story while making a few changes that I mildly Disagreed with. But the direction was still impressive with the fantastic journey of Belle, a bright, beautiful and independent young woman who is taken prisoner by a beast in his castle. Despite her fears, she befriends the castle's enchanted staff and learns to look beyond the Beast's hideous exterior and realize the kind heart and soul of the true Prince within. The CGI is truly spectacular to see, and the effects and environments felt as similar as the original which made it feel just as appealing. The appliance characters still reminded me of what they truly are in appearance and performance. The one thing that got me though is the dead-eyed expressions of some of them like the teapot and cogsworth The Acting is amazing to watch with the musical performances magical and outstanding to see with the same scenes. Emma Watson plays Belle and leaves me impressed with how she executed the performance. Dan Stevens Beast was truly impressive with how he provided anger and emotion within the acting. Luke Evans as Gaston was the best, he is perfect for the role and made it great as making him Scary yet Comedic. The one things I have ups and downs about is the new changes it made. In the original, Beast's character was portrayed as a dumbed character as he didn't know how to read or have manners, With this in mind, this gives Belle a better reason to trust him since of teachings to him. In the new version, Beast was shown to be more brighter with him owning an entire library mentioning how their in Greek. And with this in mind, we see how they can have a close relationship when Beast shows how much he has more of a minded self, even one scene he quotes Shakespeare. They also managed to bring back most songs like be our guest and the Gaston song, but also showing us new songs. Watching the new songs has more of a classic Disney feel to it including ""Evermore,"" a sympathy song for beast after Belle leaves the castle to save her father from the town, that was great though, i loved Steven's voice. Another concept that was brought was when Beast dies near the end when Belle is next to him crying, which still makes me sad in both movies. In the original, we never got to see what happened to them during that part, so they brought it in this one. They split both acts with Beast dying to an scene when we watch the appliances slowly turn into regular antiques which really made me feel emotional in a theater. And when the curse is broken the appliances turn back to humans along with the Beast which was still heartfelt Overall, Beauty and the Beast was a pretty impressive that I didn't mind watching because it is a colorful and fantastically executed movie despite the changes. The acting is outstanding and decent to watch with the characters being likable and dramatic. The CGI is truly visual magic still having it's Jungle Book scenery flare, I thought was impressive. This movie is beautiful, well acted, and a introduce us a marvelous story. B+"
"charitydunn-81732","6","6","16","19 March 2017"," A frustrating under-delivery
","This movie is not terrible, but it left me feeling deeply unsatisfied. I'm not placated by a mere nostalgia-driven rehash - I actually want a good movie, one good enough to stand on its own. That is where this film fails to deliver. <br/><br/>Bluntly, the whole thing felt ""cheap"" and shallow. The story line is virtually unchanged, and in fact most of the scenes and dialogue are lifted directly from the 1991 film. However, what was left out was the real heart and soul of the original, the subtlety of it, leaving this one flat and emotionless. Emma Watson, however talented, is no Belle; meanwhile the lovableness of the supporting characters is gone, traded for one-dimensional and at times bombastic caricatures. (Cogsworth, my favorite character as child, is completely forgettable in this version.) <br/><br/>Most egregiously, the character of the Beast is generally lessened. He was a mysterious character in the original and, to four-year-old me, a legitimately terrifying one. This made his internal transformation as dramatic and dynamic as his external one in 1991. Not so in 2017. He is made frivolous in the movie's beginning, his rage is missing from its middle, and there is no poignancy to his heartbreak or love in the end. Talk about having the emotional range of a teaspoon - I see why they cast Hermione. Not to mention his visual appearance is just... strange. I detest the goat horns, and something about his eyes is perpetually off. It is honestly distracting. <br/><br/>On to things added to the movie: first off is obviously live action. I don't understand this one. Why bother to make a live-action version and then design EVERYTHING to look cheap and fake and unrealistic anyway? I wanted this movie brought to life, not just reanimated with CGI. And then there is the music. I also didn't really need another musical, particularly if it was going to be one with frail voices, botched rearrangements, and new pieces that are cheesy and ill-fitting. Beast sings. More specifically, he sings at moment when he was roaring his heart out in the original (if that tells you anything). There's also the teleporter-book. Not sure what that is supposed to be about. It seems like nothing more than a contrived plot device added to reinforce the inclusion of Belle's backstory, which itself doesn't really wind up adding to the movie overall. <br/><br/>I could write another paragraph about the misplaced, token diversity peppering this movie, which I find infinitely more offensive than outright white-washing, but I won't. <br/><br/>A few good things: it's still a nostalgic watch. And your kids will like it, if that's why you're going. This one also makes a few more nods to the original 1740 fairy tale, which I find refreshing coming from Disney. Gaston still gets what he's got coming. But that's about it.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: If you are an adult looking for a solid new take on your old favorite, this is not it. If you are an adult looking for grown- up version of your old favorite, this is definitely not it. If you're looking for a way to entertain your kids for two hours, go have fun. Or let them go have fun, and stay home and watch the 1991 version while they're gone."

"ThomasDrufke","9","6","16","19 March 2017"," That Was Magical
","Out of all the Disney live action remakes in the works, perhaps none more sacred to film fans than Beauty and the Beast. Dissecting and critiquing every set photo, clip, and trailer to pieces, there was a ton of pressure on Bill Condon's remake. With that said, it's hard to imagine a more fitting re-imagining of the classic tale than the one we were given.<br/><br/>Let's talk about this cast. This may be the most perfectly cast film I've seen in quite some time. Starting with Emma Watson as the beloved princess, Belle. Lily James certainly had some pressure taking on Cinderella, but to today's audience, Belle is the more popular character. Watson wasn't going to please everyone, but she captures Belle's wonder, intelligence, curiosity, passion, and of course, beauty. Pair her with a great performance by Dan Stevens as the co-lead, and you have your classic romance.<br/><br/>Luke Evans as Gaston, Josh Gad as LeFou, Kevin Kline as Maurice, Ewan McGregor as Lumière, Ian McKellan as Cogsworth, and Emma Thompson as Mrs. Potts? Come on now, casting that impeccably just isn't normal. They don't just look like their animated counterparts from the 1991 version, they completely embody every aspect of what made us love them in the first place. McGregor and McKellan have a hilarious back and forth, as do Gad and Evans, and Kline & Thompson will break your heart as respected parents.<br/><br/>As for the music, which probably provided the most hesitation from avid fans. Would they change things too much? Too little? Would the new songs actually add anything of value? I wasn't bothered by any of the new music, but none of them particularly stood out either. But they nailed all of the new renditions of the classic Alan Menken hits. I don't know that anyone can top Angela Lansbury's Beauty and the Beast/Tale as Old as Time, but Emma Thompson gives it her best effort. The ""Be Our Guest"" scene? Yep, it's just as ridiculously fun as the original.<br/><br/>The additional time spent fleshing out the Beast and Belle's individual backstories felt necessary and not excessive. Really, the only thing that needed working on in this movie was Beast's CGI. There were moments of really noticeable effects work, especially in the ballroom dance sequence. Unfortunately, that's one of the most important scenes in the film, you'd think that would be something they spent a little more time on. In the same vein, not all of the green screen was polished either. I love how colorful and wondrous the production design and sets are, but that can only do so much. But if the CGI is all I'm complaining about, then I think the filmmakers did alright.<br/><br/>I watched the 1991 version a lot as a kid, so this was a remake that was near and dear to my heart and pretty much my entire generation. With the exception of a few CGI filled scenes, I think this ranks up there with the best of Disney Live Action remakes. It's not often I get swept up with emotion at the climax of a kids movie, but I just couldn't help myself with this one. The cinematography, the performances, and that legendary music all came together at the end. This was nothing short of a magical time at the theaters.<br/><br/>+Perfect cast<br/><br/>+Glorious music<br/><br/>+Felt the Disney magic once again<br/><br/>+Subtle additions were beneficial<br/><br/>-Beast CGI was worse than I originally thought<br/><br/>9.3/10"
"athanasaka","5","6","16","18 March 2017"," I'd watch it again
","It was a beautiful movie, great colours, a fairly good cast and beautiful meaning. I think Beauty and the Beast, are among the most beloved movies of Disney, and they did a fairly good work in this remake. Firsty Watson's appearance was great, she had the role and she gave a good performance. As for the rest of the cast, it was obvious that it was well worked, nothing astonishing, but good enough. During the movie I couldn't help but notice the colours. They changed beautifully as the mood changed, without it being very abrupt, or ugly. The thing about the movie is the music, it felt like there were a lot of music parts that could have been cut, at some points the movie was getting quite boring because of them and it lost its point. I know part of Disney is the music and I expected a lot of it, but it really was too much. There weren't enough dialogues, and I really don't get why isn't it called a musical. To me this movie is a good one and I would watch it again. Not for the performances, nor for the music. I would watch it again because it really is a true beauty."
"studiodays","10","6","16","18 March 2017"," Beauty and the Beast: Remains faithful to the beloved classic
","This tale as old as time, song as old as rhyme beloved classic Beauty and the Beast was put into live-action directed by Bill Condon. The story follows the 1991 original material with a few minor changes prior not to confuse the viewers and some untold stories of their youth. <br/><br/>An impressive take on storytelling although handled a bit slow-paced but I like how there were little changes that will not confuse the viewers. The movie offers a timely accurate setting and production, a nicely done retelling of Belle and Beast's old-fashioned romance, a truly spectacular new set of music and score and an overall entertaining production. Emma Watson is an ideal as Belle and Dan Stevens is devilish handsome as the Beast and the rest of the cast were just as amazing as the leads. The whole direction was able to give us nostalgia, surprisingly magical and colorful musical performances and emotional take on some important stories. The live-action remake of the animated film is not better than the original, but it's a fresh retelling because we're introduced to new characters, new songs and some stories not told in the 1991 film. Still, it remains faithful to the beloved family classic film. <br/><br/>Another thing, what I like about this movie is that it's a Disney movie and it challenges any other movie whether Disney or not to feature interracial and gay romance. There was nothing explicit in the romance and it was just a short attraction.<br/><br/>Also one thing, I think this is one the highlights of the film. I was blown away with Dan Stevens' moving performance as the Beast as he sung way up high on the tower the song ""Evermore."" The song is important in the part of the Beast and in general the whole movie. This is where the spoiled, selfish and unkind prince finally learns to love and in more elaborate way. She inspires him and will always be part of everything he does. And that is the romance of the mean, coarse and unrefined Beast turned into sweet, gentle and kind and an odd young woman who likes to read and wants something more than a provincial life fall in love with one another. <br/><br/>I give the movie 9 out of 10. It was spectacular and I think I'm going to see it again."
"asb_deutsch","6","6","16","18 March 2017"," Disney opens another chapter of family films
","I watched Beauty and the Beast in IMAX with Laser and it was nice. This resulted in bright images projected by dual projectors on the giant 42 feet high, 65 feet wide screen of IMAX, completely using the whole screen without chopping the picture. Along with 12000 Watts IMAX proprietary sound system that was used very well for the sound editing!<br/><br/>First of all, trailers are suppose to give you a teaser of the film, not tell you the plot, so don't watch the trailer at all. Next, I will rate this better than Cinderella and well worth seeing in IMAX 3D, considering the 3D is much better than Kong: Skull Island. Emma Watson is perfect as Belle, I cannot imagine anyone else portraying her. I love her acting and singing and could not take my eyes off her. The cinematography is great, often springing right out of the animation and the colors are dazzling. There is a lot to like about this movie, but unfortunately it's all the stuff we've seen before. My significant digit score: 6.8/10<br/><br/>P.S. I definitely can't wait to visit Disneyland!"
"kittenkars","10","8","24","19 March 2017"," Beauty and the Beast Review: A Magical Masterpiece.
","What a treat, Bill Condon and his star-studded cast, have in store for their Disney followers this Spring; a soul-enchanting, heart-racing, nail-biting adaptation of the well-loved Disney fairy-tale. Beauty and the Beast is the story of an independent young girl, from a rural French village, who selflessly sacrifices her own freedom for her fathers', after he is imprisoned by a prince, who has been transformed into a beast, as punishment his selfish actions.<br/><br/>Whilst most of us are familiar with the fantasy story, originally penned in 1740 by French author, Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Villeneuve, (now there's a mouthful), you may be surprised to hear that Condon has remained faithful to almost every mesmerising moment of Disney's 1991 animation, whilst filling gaps in the story line, which were not addressed in their original adaptation; for example, the thought-provoking question of what had happened to Belle's mother.<br/><br/>One of the key additions to the story line, is the introduction of a magical atlas that allows Belle (played by Emma Watson) and the Beast (played by Dan Stevens) to visit her birthplace in Paris, where she learns that her mother died after falling victim to the plague. Whilst this deviates from the original, these small contextual complements, give the story a new depth and an element of authenticity.<br/><br/>What many viewers will find interesting too, is the new crafting of a homosexual story line, between the infamous Gaston (played by Luke Evans) and his smitten sidekick LeFou. This is, of course, likely to raise a few eyebrows, and even draw disapproval from some circles, many of whom have already voiced their opinion that it is apparently ""unsuitable for younger viewers"", despite giggling over the sexual innuendo between Lumiere and his French-maid girlfriend. I prefer to see this as a symbol of advancement in the social views of modern society. The references are tastefully scripted and humorously presented by the talented Josh Gad (who plays LeFou). Some may argue that this comedic effect contradicts the argument of equality, but I would counter that with a reminder that the element of comedy presented in a 'camp' manner, merely fits with LeFou's long-held jester-like character, and is not connected directly with the fact that he is gay. Not all gay men are camp, after all, but LeFou, even in the original Disney animation, was regarded as rather ostentatious.<br/><br/>Watson's performance, as Belle, is positively captivating, whilst Dan Stevens' deep and dulcet tones will win over far more than just the heroine's heart. With the talents of Ewan McGregor, Ian McKellan and Emma Thompson playing the parts of Lumiere, Cogsworth and Mrs Potts, respectively, this all-star cast will have you singing along and laughing like a child all over again. A beautiful adaptation of a beautiful tale. This fun-filled, fantasy is a Disney delight for the whole family."
"REPetzoldt","9","8","24","17 March 2017"," Even better than the original. Complainers are off base.
","About the only thing about this version that was not as good as the old one is Beauty and the Beast in the closing credits. It was so excellent to see actual humans rather than animation performing the parts. Emma Watson was surprisingly strong acting and singing the part of Belle. The beast played by Dan Stevens was more humorous but less comical and more believable than the animated one. All the performances were quite good. Sure Emma Thompson was not quite as wonderful as Angela Lansbury, but was still very good. Luke Evans played an excellently despicable Gaston. I liked all the directorial choices and every change made from the original was an improvement. Masterful job Disney in updating this classic."

But after watching the live action movie (Beauty and the Beast) the question has become pointless.<br/><br/>Beauty and Beast is a near perfect movie in all the aspects. Bill Condon's directorial keeps the audience spell bound at times. The visuals are fresh and colorful. The costumes, the CGI, the castle adds extra color to the already mesmerizing visuals.<br/><br/>The background score and the songs compliments the story. Alan Menken's work has traveled along the nerves of the movie and lives in our hearts. Apt song selections and placements are perfect.<br/><br/>Experiencing something you have already experienced (At least in animation) might bore, but Bill Condon has mastered the art. His direction never lets down the audience. He has worked hard in each and every detail which is a huge plus for the movie.<br/><br/>Cast performance:<br/><br/>Emma Watson as Belle would make everyone fall for her. It is the perfect character for her, instead she is the perfect pick for the character. She is charming as ever, the costumes brighten her beauty. Though the little alteration to her character might not impress few, she still emerges our favorite.<br/><br/>Dan Stevens as the Beast does his job to perfection. The visual effects might shade his expressions his acting saves for it. A perfect beast and a lover.<br/><br/>The voice by Ewan McGregor, Ian McKellen, Emma Thompson, and Stanley Tucci for the antiques in the castle were excellent. An adorable addition to the already strong cast.<br/><br/>What works:<br/><br/>* Visuals and CGI effects * Songs and Music * Bill Condon's direction * Emma's charm * Dan Steven's acting<br/><br/>What didn't work:<br/><br/>* Emma's character alteration (A mild one though) * The first Gay moment in Disney (Might be because of the controversies)<br/><br/>On the whole it's a never miss movie.

"GomezAddams666","6","6","17","16 March 2017"," Tale as Old as Time? Not by a long shot.
","It's hard not to spoil a story that we have known for 26 years but I will try. Let me start by saying that my hopes for the movie were not the highest in the world, but it was actually pretty good, better than expected.<br/><br/>The live-action feature manages to flesh out a few things from the animated version, it wants to blend the Disney cartoon and the fairy tale of old and it achieves just that with barely no effort. It is also to notice that Emma Watson gives a tremendous performance as Belle and Dan Peters tho a CGI character for almost the entire movie makes a lovable beast. Emma Watson personifies the beauty in the inside and the outside, you can really tell that she put all her effort into honoring this timeless story.<br/><br/>The supporting cast was terrific, the songs we know and love will draw you to tears but the real diamond in the rough here is Josh Gad as Lefou. Not only was he amazingly funny as Gaston's sidekick but he was also his own person and the character with more personal growth of the entire cast, this could very well be his movie.<br/><br/>However, what kills the enjoyment as I had feared was Luke Evans' performance as the antagonist Gaston, he was more of a cartoon than the actual cartoon version from start to finish, a cliché scene after scene not believable as a person, not even as a cartoon character. It was a poorly written character and a horrible performance, I was by the end either wishing I could watch the same movie with a different Gaston or that he hadn't even been there. Some tongue in cheek moments are also cringe worthy and manage to kill the make belief of the story.<br/><br/>Countering the good with the bad I have to say with a clear conscience that I rate this 6 out of 10. Sure, it is enjoyable to be seen once, maybe twice... but it is not at all remarkable, nor is it timeless. There is beauty in the film, just not enough to counter all the beastly choices the filmmakers made. There's nothing there that wasn't there before."

","I VERY rarely ever give out a 10 of 10 rating... I also even more rarely write a review on a movie, but after watching this spectacular movie I had to share my humble opinion with the world.<br/><br/>If you were a fan of the original you will adore this movie. My best friend brought to my attention something that helped me understand why everyone should give any remake of a classic a chance. After a while you've seen the classic so much, that you may stop watching it...it could be because your brain has it memorized and you can just play it over and over again in your head and not have to watch it, but more likely it may be because you just get tired of seeing it so much so you enjoy it on rare occasions (May 4th when I watch all the Star Wars movies)...BUT a remake either spices it up OR it makes you take the original out and WANT to watch it again...THIS MOVIE DOES BOTH!!! The music, the songs, the characters, the addition of back story....all of it instilled that magical feeling of wonderment that the original movie did so well at doing when I was only 10 years old (excluding the back story part because the original didn't do that as well). There was also a few new songs to now learn.<br/><br/>The costumes, make-up, and visuals had that wonderful flare of France to match the period and location of where the story was set to take place. There was also a lot of clever hidden jokes to keep the adults chuckling, the kids asking, and the adults saying ""Ill tell you when you're older"" knowing good and damn well that you aren't going to tell them anything. LOL (I'm older now, though) :) So, in conclusion if you are a fan of the original go see it you'll appreciate that they changed very little and the parts they might have changed (which I didn't notice much) just added a magical flare to the movie.<br/><br/>If you never saw the original, go see this movie you'll love it!!! It stands alone as a great story.<br/><br/>If you saw the original, but you are not a fan of remakes...just give it a shot! As a slightly skeptical fan of remakes, I personally enjoyed it VERY MUCH!"

","Within ten minutes of ""Beauty and the Beast"" 2017. I wanted to rise from my seat and applaud. Within twenty minutes I had laughed, gasped, and been wowed. I can't say ""go see it."" You will see it. It's going to be a classic. <br/><br/>I saw a ten a.m. matinée, thinking that I'd avoid the crowds. No way. The theater was full. Some little girls were dressed in fairy tale gowns. In spite of the film's length, I didn't see anyone bail – no one left the theater and never returned. When the film ended, the audience broke out in applause. <br/><br/>I love watching lots of money and talent explode on every inch of my visual field. ""Beauty and the Beast"" slathers on the money *and* the TLC. Someone took the time to paint roses on the lintels of a cottage, and to costume Belle in bloomers so she can ride a horse, and to wrinkle the noses of the CGI wolves when they growl. <br/><br/>""Beauty and the Beast"" feels very much like a fairy tale. It has the plot conventions and morality of a fairy tale. The wolves menace when menacing wolves are needed to move the plot along, and they are nowhere to be seen when Belle needs to ride through that forest without being interrupted. This is how fairy tales work. They have their own logic. A peasant crone entering a rich man's house, begging for alms and being refused – that is the classic spark of a witch frenzy, or a curse. <br/><br/>Watching Emma Watson delighted me just as watching Julie Andrews in films like ""Mary Poppins"" and ""Sound of Music"" once did. Watson is an intelligent, dignified, decent human being and that comes across in her every move. She's never the dumb blonde, never the shrinking violet or damsel in distress, never the flirtatious coquette who has nothing to recommend her but her curves. She inhabits the role of a smart, inquisitive, integral human being. <br/><br/>Twinkly-eyed old pro Kevin Kline is a favorite. Ewan Macgregor somehow manages to turn on the charm even as he is nothing more than a CGI candlestick. Emma Thompson imbues a ""there, there now"" maternal instinct into a Cockney teapot, Stanley Tucci, Audra MacDonald, and Ian McKellan are more jewels in the cast. <br/><br/>You can practically smell the testosterone coming off of Luke Evans as Gaston. He's both funny and menacing, just handsome enough and just oily enough. <br/><br/>The few complaints I have with this film I had with the animated version as well. I wish there were more time spent building a relationship between The Beast and Belle, and less time spent on chase and fight scenes, but I recognize that this is primarily a film for children and kids don't want to watch the kind of subtle interaction and tender moments that Jean Cocteau depicted in his live action, adult-oriented 1946 ""La Belle et la Bete."" <br/><br/>I do think that Gaston is an anti-male character. Gaston is not just a bad guy. He's an indictment of traditional masculinity. But that's a whole 'nother essay. <br/><br/>I do wish we had had more time with The Beast generally. Dan Stevens is a very good looking man. I wanted more of him, both before and after transformation, and more of The Beast. But you can't have everything. For that, there's fan-fiction, and there's a lot of it on the web. <br/><br/>About the protests. LeFou casts yearning glances in Gaston's direction, and there is a very brief shot of him dancing with another male character. And  that's it. *All* the movie does is remind us that there are gay people among our friends, neighbors, and fairy tale characters. There is nothing graphic or inappropriate for children. In fact, most children won't even notice LeFou's orientation. I'm not even sure I would have, had I not read articles about protests before going to see the film. <br/><br/>Too many Christians are willing financially to support violent, misogynist, and graphic films, TV shows and video games. If you liked the violent movie ""Logan,"" if you voted for a man who speaks about grabbing – ahem – if you laugh at contemptuous humor, and yet you protest this lovely film, you need something that this movie provides – a magical mirror. Not so you can see far away, but so you can see yourself."

","I am astonished that so many people have given this bad reviews when its literally only been out since last night. Come on people. I actually saw the movie and it was magical and amazing. The music (other than on the one by Arianna Grande and John Legend) was astonishing. The script was very well crafted. I loved that they showed that time was really passing. It truly felt like the Beast and Beauty fell in love rather than Cinderella and the Prince (insta love). I've seen a lot of people saying the CGI was badly done, but I beg to differ. There was no part of that movie that was badly done concerning CGI. Dan Stevens played a very good beast and I was not disappointed when he turned back into a man (unlike the original cartoon). There were a lot of people saying they were going to avoid this film because of rumors of a ""gay scene"" which is absurd partly because there wasn't one. Please watch the movie before writing reviews next time. Thanks. I recommend seeing it!"

"matthewssilverhammer","5","4","10","23 March 2017"," The First Disney Remake to Feel Mostly Pointless
","Disney's latest money-printerI mean live-action remakehas most everything we all love about the 1992 animated opus: the magical romance, the fun characters, the beautiful art direction, and possibly the greatest collection of songs in Disney's impressive canon. And based on the first weekend box office, audiences are more than happy to be guests in this world again. The problem for me is that everything they love here, they love, or would love, in the much superior original. Instead of taking a new approach to their property (i.e. Cinderella, Jungle Book), Beauty and the Beast is essentially a moment-for-moment remake with some hit-and-miss additions. So you already know the story: girl is imprisoned by beast, beast learns to love, girl returns love, etc. A couple of backstory facelifts and plot-hole fixes are really the only changes in this update, and they do serve their purpose. Even the romance itself is given a needed expansion, making their love slightly more genuine. However, those additions also further other pressing questions (why did she stay imprisoned for so long?). Also, the titular characters are just plain worse. The normally competent and likable Watson is completely out of her element, opting for a quieter and frankly smugger Belle than the quirky and free-spirited one, and the beast roars uncanny valley like a furry Transformer. On the plus side, the household objects (Lumiere, Cogsworth, etc) have a much better arc, including more than a few funny moments and a surprisingly emotional plight. The question is: are these additions enough to warrant a brand-new movie? I guess if you refuse to revisit the original then they are. Otherwise, they simply aren't."
"rs403404","6","4","10","20 March 2017"," 'Beauty and the Beast': Another Pointless Remake
","There's really one key question you have to ask yourself when remaking a classic: how are you making this different than before? how are you contributing to the mythos of this story? At best, it's unwise to create a remake without an original vision; it will surely suffer when compared to the original. Remember Gus Van Sant's misguided shot-for-shot remake of ""Psycho""?<br/><br/>2017's ""Beauty and the Beast"" isn't nearly as ill-advised, but it's in the same vain. Disney has been remaking their animated classics into live action films over the past few years, primarily due to the success of 2010's ""Alice in Wonderland"". However, with the exception of Jon Favreau's spectacular ""The Jungle Book"", the whole endeavor has been grossly underwhelming. Sadly, ""Beauty and the Beast"" is not an exception.<br/><br/>That's not to say the movie is bad per se. It's well made with some incredibly talented actors in the mix (Kevin Kline, Ewan Mcgregor, Stanley Tucci, Emma Thompson, and Ian Mckellan all in supporting roles) solidly mixing drama with gentle goofiness. The animation on Beast is iffy, but in general, the computer effects are well done. The movie is overlong, but the pacing balances out this issue for the most part. Honestly, in a vacuum, this would be a very good movie.<br/><br/>However, this movie doesn't exist in the vacuum. The 1991 animated classic is essentially the same movie. Sure, this version includes some more backstory for the supporting cast, but it's nothing that's necessary. Some of the changes are good and some are bad. In the end, the changes are a wash to the movie's overall quality.<br/><br/>As for the stuff they didn't change, it's near identical to the original. It's to the point where they almost certainly just cut and pasted pages of 1991's script into this movie. As an example of the changes, there's a key point in this movie where things play out as they did in 1991, however, some details are altered such that the end product doesn't make sense.<br/><br/>All the classic songs make a return in decent covers by the new cast. However, they also add new songs. If you've just emerged from a cave after 30 years, there's an easy way to tell which are the classic songs and which are new: the classic songs are the good ones.<br/><br/>Fact is, while this is a solid movie on it's own, it's impossible to recommend when in-essence this movie already exists. If you're a huge Beauty and the Beast fan and await with bated-breath any incarnation of this story, then wait no more, you'll probably have fun with this. The rest of us should save our money and rent the 1991 movie."
"heather_smedsrud","9","8","26","16 March 2017"," Magical From Start To Finish
","Having grown up with the animated Beauty and the Beast, I could not wait to see this live-action version. Not only was I not disappointed, but the movie exceeded any expectations I had going in. The movie is magical from start to finish, full of familiar characters, songs, stories, and places. It introduces us to plenty of new characters, songs, stories, and places but does so in a way that respects and enhances all that was original. The blend of old and new is wonderfully done. The humor sprinkled throughout was a fun touch. The musical numbers were amazing, especially ""Be Our Guest"". <br/><br/>Some reviewers have pointed out flaws in the CGI and Emma Watson's portrayal of Belle. I looked for and did not spot any obvious or distracting CGI elements. The characters looked realistic but still had a sense of whimsy to them. Emma was stunning as Belle. Everything from her singing voice to the intelligence and strong will she showed through the character was fantastic. <br/><br/>I would highly recommend this movie for anyone who is a fan of the original movie and can go into this one with an open mind. It does contain some scary moments and mild violence though, so I would caution parents of young children to research it or see it first."
"abelhawk","1","5","14","30 September 2017"," Sloppy and above all, unnecessary
","I don't see why Disney feels like they have to make live action remakes of their classics just FOR THE SAKE OF making live action remakes of their classics. This film had 0 innovation, was essentially a poorly-acted scene-for-scene remake of the animated version, and just didn't have an ounce of the magic of the old classic. Emma Watson was a very unconvincing Belle. The beast looked utterly fake—like Snapshot-filter fake. I've seen better CGI in old 90s movies. The ""humor"" was tasteless, the twists on the songs were ridiculous, and there always seemed to be too many extras on screen at the same time, as if no one in the film had a life but to be watching the main plot unfold—it was almost exactly like a live musical of the original Beauty in the Beast with bad CGI and without the charm of an actual live performance. And for a story that takes place in mid-1700s France, there were TOO MANY black people in this film! I'm not being racist at all, I'm simply wishing that the film had enough dignity to be historical. It would be odd for a movie that takes place in India to have Caucasian and Asian people in it, so why did they feel the need to make mid-1700s France look like South Africa?<br/><br/>Above everything else wrong with this anathema of a movie, this film was utterly and exhaustingly predictable. I knew exactly what was going to happen in every single beat of the film. Why was this film made? The classic is always going to be the best, so why dress people up in CGI clothes and costumes and make them recite lines from it again? There is no reason for anyone to watch this movie. It is redundant and soulless, and an enormous waste of time."
"jathanclark","6","5","14","18 March 2017"," Attractive new Beauty still pales next to the original classic
","Disney's new and improved ""Beauty and the Beast"" has lots going for it. <br/><br/>The beast's voice (as rumbled by Dan Stevens) is perfect, as is Ewan MacGregor's Lumiere and Ian McKellan's Cogsworth. In fact, the whole cast is attractive, engaging and surprisingly musical (who knew Luke Evans could sing?). Speaking of music, the original songs are just as good as you remember. There's even a few additional numbers that, while not spectacular, add color and depth to the story.<br/><br/>Speaking of spectacle, the biggest Beauty in this version is the production value. As I watched, every new scene had another gorgeous set piece. The entire Disney stable was obviously working overtime and it shows. Every chandelier is wrought with golden filigree, every turret on the castle is weathered and majestic, every costume gleams with ribbons and needlework. Even the horns of the beast are works of art.<br/><br/>I am also pleased to say that the story itself, is, aside from a few minor additions, essentially identical to the original. This really is the 'tale as old as time' and nothing new could improve it. The filmmakers made the right call here.<br/><br/>With so many things going right for it, this new Beauty is unfortunately missing one very important thing:<br/><br/>Belle.<br/><br/>Emma Watson isn't Belle. She just isn't. Even if you haven't seen the original it's obvious that something is missing from our Disney Heroine. On the surface Watson has everything we need. She's beautiful. She's plucky. She can sing, she can dance - heck, she's even comfortable on horseback.<br/><br/>With all those boxes checked, you'd think the movie would soar - and there are moments when it lifts off. But multiple times I found myself pulled out of the experience by Watson's disconnection. Unfortunately, she is only partially engaged with the character and so we cannot fall completely in love.<br/><br/>Now, to be fair, I've heard critics say Watson is only marginally talented and I would disagree. Her version of Sam was the reason Perks of Being a Wallflower is a millennial classic - and let's be honest, could you imagine anyone else as Hermione? No, I don't think her talent is in question. I'm honestly not exactly sure what happened. It's possible that acting against a digital actor was too difficult. It's also possible that with a giant studio movie like this there were too many cooks in the kitchen. Regardless, Emma Watson's uneven performance is the major weakness of the film.<br/><br/>If you loved the original you're obviously going to see this version - and you should. It's beautiful, enjoyable and you'll leave the theatre singing some of the best Disney music of all time. But I'm willing to bet you'll also have a stronger urge to see the cartoon version, and perhaps that was the point of this remake all along. The 1991 Disney film remains one of the best movies ever made.<br/><br/>Three stars (out of four)"

I actually thought the casting was great and some of the changes were great. And actually the remake was a lot like the original to me. It seems like many people were disappointed because they had British actors and a few other actors who weren't and were American instead of French ones like in the original. Um...hello?! Did you see the original where they had American actors act out in the original?! Or maybe people thought the people who played Belle (Watson) or Gaston (Evans) were not the right cast because Belle wasn't as ""good looking"" as the original or Gaston wasn't as ""deep voiced"" or ""buff"" as the original; or maybe because people expected more in the film, but the whole Belle and Gaston case was what I mostly heard from people who were disappointed in this remake. But no matter what those people thought, I still thought this was a great remake. 10 out of 10 stars! I highly recommend for people who love Emma Watson, and any Disney remake!"

"srdjan_veljkovic","5","3","7","17 May 2017"," Quite a few things to like, but, all-in-all, not very good
","Most of all, it's inferior to the original cartoon. Emma Watson is not cute, old songs are not played and sung as well and the new ones are not as good, the whole ""live household"" doesn't work as good (one of the biggest letdowns is the little teacup, Chip) and the fundamental plot is revealed right at the start. I mean, sure, most folks did see the cartoon and/or know the tale, yet, it works much better when you discover it as you go along, because you have a better understanding of what Belle is going through. .<br/><br/>But, Gaston works surprisingly well, Lumiere too - kind of makes you think Ewan McGregor can do no wrong in a musical. Kevin Klein as a somber old man (Belle's father) is interesting. The wolves sequences are very well done. There are several good jokes, some of which are not repeated from the cartoon, Bell has a few nice moments (though most are repeated from the cartoon).<br/><br/>So, it's OK, but not very good and certainly way over-hyped."
"jammin_jam","5","3","7","15 May 2017"," Boring and the Bland
","Beauty and the Beast is another utterly pointless cash-grab of a remake. While not a bad movie, it is nowhere near as good as the original. Somehow, this film is nowhere near as emotional despite the fact that it involves real tangible human beings instead of cartoons. The new cast is hit and miss. Josh Gad and Kevin Kline provide some much needed charm and levity to the film. On the flip-side, the leads (specifically Emma Watson) are spectacularly underwhelming. Emma Watson simply does not look, sing, or act the part. The movie plays like a pale imitation of the original. Ultimately the whole thing is brought down by the script. It is essentially the same script as the original, but there are certain changes thrown in simply for the purpose of change. There are multiple sub-plots added which just come off as unnecessary filler. What makes matters worse, is that the film cuts out important story beats from the original in order to make room for the new unnecessary sub-plots. Other than some solid visuals and performances this movie doesn't offer much. Overall, Beauty and the Beast (2017) isn't good, and it isn't bad. It's just pointless."

","Let's face it if Disney is going to continue to line their pockets with more cash by releasing live action versions of animations they better be spectacular. This movie is well made and well acted but I wouldn't say spectacular. It's a solid adaptation. I'm not sure about Emma Watson as Belle. She's an attractive woman who's very talented but I don't think of her as beautiful. I get it, box office marquis names aren't always the best casting choices and she didn't detract. One of the best parts was Dan Stevens and the writers who gave depth to the Beast and at least partially satisfied my questions about why Belle would fall in love with him. Kevin Kline was solid as Belle's Dad. Gaston was the right casting choice Josh Gad was very funny as his probably gay sidekick, LeFou. The music was above par and there were a few new songs too. All in all a solid effort although a bit too long. We've all seen the story so you won't necessarily be astounded by the live action version but you won't dislike it."
"greggs_nbacon","7","3","7","6 April 2017"," Try the grey stuff it's delicious
","The first thing you should know before seeing this movie is it is not the original film. throw all concept of the original film out of your mind, because of you compare the two films, you will be monumentally disappointed. Nostalgia plays a big part in why we love the movies from our childhood, whether or not they are truly actually good. However, the original animated Beauty and the Beast was a masterpiece of animation. It was the first animated film to be nominated for Best Picture. I know it is hard to try and drop comparison, but please, try to do it, and think of this film as its own entity.<br/><br/>This version of Beauty and the Beast clocks in at just over 2 hours, nearly forty minutes longer than the original film. In the film, they deeply explore some more of the themes of feminism and misunderstanding that the original just glances over. Some of the exploration of the past really works well. However, some sequences fall flat, like the exploration of the Parisian windmill. Not everything necessarily needs explaining within a film, and it almost felt as if the writers assumed the audience was a little dumber than they actually are.<br/><br/>One aspect of this film that drove me crazy was the visual effects. Don't get me wrong, there moments where I was very impressed by some of the lavish effects. That being said, there were many times it was just plain overkill. The Be Our Guest sequence featured far too many flashing colors that made me think I was developing either ADHD or epilepsy. I felt the computer graphic image rendering to be nothing more than sloppy. the wolves in the movie made me wonder how any computer artist could think that the work on them was remotely good enough to put on the screen. That is how fake and unrealistic they looked. I found big problems also with the design of the Beast. When doing my research, I found that director Bill Condon wanted to create the Beast with skilled makeup rather than CGI. However, Condon's request was overpowered by the studio heads in charge of the film, I wold have much rather had a practical made Beast because his face was at time frighteningly terrible. I gave praise to Logan's visual effects yesterday, and how well they were done. Beauty and the Beast brought back to why I hate bad CGI more than nearly anything else in film, as it can ruin so much within a singular movie. Finally, some of the interactions between the furniture and the live actors felt clunky to me as well. Many shots in the film had me question director of photography Tobias Schliesser's credentials as someone they did not pick up off the street on the day production began. Many of the pullback shots were so out of focus of the characters that you could hardly see the character singing. Seeing as Beauty and the Beast is the most expensive musical ever made, I truly believe they should have put more time and effort into the visual effects.<br/><br/>A major criticism of the film came in the casting of the actors, and their inability to sing or fill the roles of the original voice actors. Here's the deal. Voice actors only have to worry about their voice. That is the only thing they have to contribute to a film. Of course, their voices are going to be better than live action actors, who have many more dimensions to their performances. Yes, many of the actors in Beauty and the Beast are not trained singers by any means sans Audra McDonald. However, they give very solid performances of the songs. Original songwriter Alan Menken even wrote some new songs for the live action film. Are they slightly forgettable? Yes. However, they are decently enjoyable tunes. The original songs have stood the test of time of the past twenty-five years. They are bound to be more memorable songs. Much of the casting was pretty spot on, in my opinion. Emma Watson did a wonderful job exploring the feministic side of Belle, showing the characters quiet strength in not only her acting but vocal performance. There was no performance I think in the film that really held it back. I still wish Jean Dujardin was cast as Lumiere over Ewan McGregor, but you can't always get what you want. Josh Gad is once again a scene stealer as the more flamboyant model of LeFou. Also, if you cannot handle a homosexual subplot for not even four minutes of a film, you should not see movies. The ""gay Lefou"" storyline was blown so far out of proportion by the media that you hardly even recognize it in the film.<br/><br/>Not enough praise is given to the technicians who create so much of the films we see and get so little of the credit. The same goes for Beauty and the Beast. The set design and costume design was lavish and distinguished, and should definitely be recognized by The Academy for Oscar nominations.<br/><br/>Beauty and the Beast has moments where its brilliance shines through. However, many parts of it feel clunky and too in your face. Overall, it is an above average musical that is enjoyable throughout. If you must compare it to the animated class which it is based, I give you this shocking thought: Remakes are very rarely better than the original, and this film is absolutely no different.<br/><br/>Score: (7/10)"
"dietaube","7","3","7","25 March 2017"," No time for emotions
","It's very sad to see, that the animated movie from the 90s has had more sense of timing and creating atmosphere. The remake is alright, but it misses the opportunity to create real emotions and strong relationships between the characters. And to be honest, Emma Watson didn't put many emotions or any kind of good acting in this movie. There is a huge party on the table, plates and bowls are dancing and making a fuzz and all she does is stare and smile. I would flip the f*** out if my dinner would dance and sing around me! The animation of the beast is questionable as well and I think Disney could have put much more effort in it. But at the same time Lumiere and all the other furniture were animated really well and if they are in the scene, you'll have a good time! To wrap this up, it's an enjoyable movie but misses the opportunity to create emotions or any kind of atmosphere."

Emma Stone doesn't have the best singing voice but with the right songs and background music, it works in La La Land (heck she even won an Oscar) 'Belle' is such a powerful song and I am afraid the film lost me in the first 10 minutes as I simply wasn't convinced, Waston did not even look as though she was singing, her mouth shape was not right for the volume that it was meant to be singing. As she sings in most songs, this was a big complaint.<br/><br/>Did anyone else feel the entire film was ticking off plot holes from the animated film? The decadent party showing us the Princes selfishness? The village bewitched explaining the ignorance of the villagers? Gaston behaviour explained by being a war hero? Maybe these are details from the original fable, but to me it felt the director watched 'Everything wrong with...' Youtube video and was correcting everything from the animated version. And what was the deal with Belles mother? that whole section could have been cut and not made one jot of difference to the final story. Another example of filler to flesh out this movie to fulfil a 2 hour running time.<br/><br/>My final complaint was the darkness, this was a very very dark looking film, I saw it in 2D and I felt I was wearing shades. I couldn't make out parts of the film when the camera panned.<br/><br/>All in all a bloated version of the original with some major nitpicks, certainty not the modern masterpiece everyone is raving about but if Zootopia can make over a billion, this will make 2 bil. Do yourself a favour and watch the 1991 version, or watch this version when the hype has died down so you don't get lynched at work when you agree with me (I am writing this reviewing from a cupboard hiding from a work mob!)"

","Beauty and the Beastiality is a tough movie to watch as a cartoon, it's even more disturbing as a live action film. first off, the story is about abuse and allowing a person to imprison you and abuse you with the hope that there is a better person underneath it all and falling in love with this person. seeing this Stockholm Syndrome story played out in live action may be a little tougher for some viewers. but the part i couldn't get passed is the fact that this dude probably stunk because his fur would get all wet out in the snow. dogs stink when they come in from the snow, imagine a dog that big. it appears to be a period before sanitation, so where and how does he poop and pee? that beast has sharp teeth and is breathing all over that girl. his breath probably was all stank. Plus, giving oral would not be pleasurable for a woman. Unless he licks like a dog, then that might be pleasurable. Not to mention an erection. What would that be like? Is like a bull penis or is it more like the dog lipstick?<br/><br/>then, SPOILER ALERT for those of you who don't know the ending of a 300 year old story, after the beast becomes a man (a man who probably looks better as a walking buffalo), the girl wants him to grow a beard. what next? bringing animals into the bedroom? also, my wife brought up that he had hooves and hind legs like a cow, so how does he get up and down the stairs? The actress, though attractive, didn't really have what i thought would be the Bella look. i know it's corny and probably not expected in this modern world, but perhaps someone like Ariana Grande would fit better in this roll (plus, she sings). also, where's all the gay $#!+ that everyone was talking about? i waited so long for it, with my Vaseline and Kleenex and saw nothing. did i miss something? sure, there was a guy who gets put in a dress and enjoys it, but as my social brainwashing goes, that does not make one gay. then the two dudes dancing together. unless they're rubbing up on each other, doing the bump and grind or grabbing each other's ass, then i don't think that's gay. but then again, you're watching a musical -- now, that's gay. also, the state of Alabama is said to have a problem with Disney having a gay character, and the worst of it is two dudes dance together, yet they have no problem with a woman getting it on with a buffalo. But, then again, it's Alabama."

","Director Bill Condon (""Dreamgirls"" - 2006) knows his way around real-life big budget films, however, his current special/visual/CGI effects film is too dark (literally it's in shadow throughout much of the film) to be thoroughly enjoyed by it's primary audience - children. As for the ""gay"" issue, PLEASE! Guys briefly wearing female clothing and/or a few seconds of two men dancing together does not make a gay film. To Condon's credit, he doesn't change the story much, so if you've seen the animation and the live theatre production (and who hasn't?), there's really no need to see this version. Belle (played by all grown up Emma Watson ""Harry Potter"") does a nice job, giving her Belle more of self assured female presences. The Beast (Dan Stevens - Matthew from ""Downton Abbey) costumes and make-up is terrific, and Stevens' managers to display a nice warm conflict in emotions throughout. On the other hand, Gaston (Luke Evans ""Dracula"" 2014) is over the top in dialogue and jesters, making his character a Laurel and Hardy team opposite LeFou (Josh Gad ""Book of Mormon""). While it's always great to see Kevin Kline on the big screen, his Maurice didn't feel connected to the story, and the ""antique"" VoiceOvers (Ewan McGregor, Ian McKellen, Emma Thompson, Audra McDonald and Stanley Tucci) were fun in CGI format, when they transformed back to human, it was all too stagy for my enjoyment. In fact, the big wrap at the end was really the end for me. Maybe I'm just tired of film/TV musicals?"
"gsygsy","6","4","11","20 March 2017"," Lacking
","Ah, these time-honoured classic stories, such easy money for the studios. Well, maybe not that easy. Although this one has had megadollars thrown at it, it never gets off the ground. Emma Watson in the lead is, I think, attempting feistiness, but although it may be a part of her in spirit, it doesn't communicate itself to an audience from the screen. Nor is Dan Stevens' easy charm up to the demands of the prince-beast, not helped by the bestial side being entirely CGI instead of motion-capture: a strange decision.<br/><br/>The extra songs by Alan Mencken and Tim Rice don't add anything much to the score of the 1991 animated film. Emma Thompson's rendition of the title number does, however, match Angela Lansbury's original, both in warmth and sparkle. I'm sad to say that it's pretty much the only example of something in this new version rising to such a comparison.<br/><br/>The production design is brilliant and sumptuous but, at the mercy of the choice of 18th century France as the movie's chosen period, sometimes feels crowded in the frame, over-busy, fussy. The costumes somehow rise above this limitation, especially in the finale.<br/><br/>Of the other performers, Ewan McGregor and Audra McDonald shine out, but Luke Evans, as vain, villainous Gaston, gives dynamic, high-octane value, wiping the floor with both Ms Watson and Mr Stevens.<br/><br/>I've no doubt it'll make its budget back in gazillions, but, unlike the studio's revamped Jungle Book, this is decidedly second-hand."
"ghost_dog86","5","4","11","19 March 2017"," Save some money. Watch the animated version.
","Call me a poor sport or a fun killer or someone who takes movies too seriously or even a film critic, but as a movie-goer I found this live-action remake to be completely unnecessary and all together forgettable, just like that 2015 live-action Disney adaption of Cinderella. Remember that one?...I didn't think so. <br/><br/>Synopsis: This ""tale as old as time"" (adapted from Disney's 1991 animated Beauty and the Beast) once again tells the story of a vain prince who is turned into a hideous beast, until he can find a young girl who is able to see his inner beauty and fall in love with him. This ""Beauty and the Beast"" does have some entertaining moments of its own creation, mainly when Cogsworth and Lumiere (played to perfection by Ian McKellen and Ewan McGregor) take center stage. But that's about all. Basically everything else I enjoyed about this movie was plucked directly from the 1991 animated version; a version which is arguably one of the greatest Disney films/musicals ever made. Now while I usually hate when people compare remakes to their originals, since when critiquing a film you really want to take that singular film experience and analyze it in as much of a ""bubble"" as humanly possible, in regards to Disney's live-action ""Beauty and the Beast"", this is simply impossible since it's pretty much a 80-90% shot for shot remake (obviously there are going to be things that must be altered when adapting straight from animation, i.e. you can't possibly show Luke Evans who plays Gaston, eating five dozen eggs unless you want him dead). The main alterations being: the live-action element (or course) the addition of a few new and completely forgettable songs and (spoiler alert) LeFou (played by Josh Gad) is gay now, which probably would have been seen as a more progressive move by Disney if he'd been in more than four scenes. <br/><br/>Bill Condon's direction was serviceable, highlighted only by the set design and choreography during the musical numbers, but the CGI was cartoonish to the point of sloppy at times. As for the other performances, Emma Watson as Belle was fine (undoubtedly this would've been my very same critique if she'd starred in ""La La Land"") and so was Evans as Gaston. And even though as an actor Dan Stevens, who plays the Beast, usually annoys me because I believe his acting to be 99% facial expression, this facial recognition based CGI character seemed to suit him quite well. <br/><br/>Final Thought: I'm still giving this movie a minimal recommendation only because it's not a bad film. As I said, there are entertaining moments, and the songs brought over from the 1991 version are always a pleasure to hear. But if you're going to pay money and take your kids to see ""Beauty and the Beast"", why not just stay home and watch the better version?"
"akoaytao1234","6","4","11","19 March 2017"," Hermoine and her Beast
","Beauty and the Beast is live action adaptation of the beloved 90's animation of the same name. It follows the nerdy Belle as she leaps off her small provincial town to be trapped in the mysterious world of the Beast. I would not lie, this film really leaves a lot of things to be talked about as it really is quite a mixed bag of positives and negatives. <br/><br/>To start off my discussion, the first half of the film is very confusing. It felt like a lot of exposition needed to firmly root the relationships within this updated film were left out. I could not help but be lost at times when some 'different-from-the- original' moments happens every now and then. Also, it negatively affected the setup of some scenes further down the film. In addition, the first half of the film was oddly centered in showcasing the film's special effects and uncomfortably darker than expected.<br/><br/>Secondly, a lot of acting in this film left me with very mixed feelings. Emma Watson just did not do it for me as Belle. Though the modern interpretation of Belle is interesting to say the least , Watson does not have enough charisma to carry her character. Also, while I do not see anything bad staying true to the original, I was really bothered by some awful voice acting in this film. If they cannot make a good impression of the original , then maybe change it up. I cannot stop cringing every time I hear awful voice impression every now and then.<br/><br/>Lastly, the effects in this film is shockingly wonky. Given that this is a huge production, I am kinda disappointed how the CGI characters is very stilted and hindered some of the framing in this film, especially those scenes including Mrs.Potts. Also, those CGI pan shots are migraine hazards, gosh. Those scenes were the worst. <br/><br/>On the positive side, when the Beast and Belle started to appear together and the romance portion of the film starts to pick up, everything just suddenly worked for the better. The mood, the story and the changes are just better than the first half. Also, I kinda find the lightening of the overall mood of the film greatly lift the film from its intensely stiff first half. <br/><br/>Acting wise, Luke Evans and Olaf takes this film. They were both stayed true to the original yet their expressed it as their very own. They pretty much stole the show every time they are on the screen. In addition, Ewan Mcgrewor and Ian Mckellen were amazing in their respective voice role as Lumiere, and Cogsworth. <br/><br/>Overall, Disney's live-action film update to the much beloved animated film is a mix high highs and low lows but in the end, the film stayed true to what the original intended to be and it kinda worked. I might not say it is better than the original (which, take note, also did not do it for me) but it is an admirable try and surely an enjoyable watch[3/5]"

Ok, they added the story of Belle's mother and extended the spell to the whole village, but this is not what it's called ""telling the story in a new and fresh way"". It simply means adding an extra detail to an already set story.<br/><br/>The idea of having Emma Watson playing the part of Belle seemed to be winning. I don't know if it's Emma's fault or the director's, but the result is that Belle looks boring, flat and serious. Just an example: look at when she's having the animated dinner. She simply smiled, like she was staring at an advertising in the television. Not at all amazed nor astonished by it as she should have been.<br/><br/>Finally, I think they could have done something more interesting with the Beast's look.

The costumes and sets are wonderful. So much for what it got right. Now: The Animation was terrible. Luke Evans as Gaston? Really. Gaston should be a huge, handsome, harry brute! We got a mediocre Hollywood pretty boy. More proof Hollywood cannot thing outside their little box. Emma Thompson as Mrs. Potts? Guess they wanted her to have a larger roll, but she should have been the Enchantress! Have they never seen Nanny McPhee? Hattie Morahan is a good actress, no problem with her performance - but really, this was a HUGE miss. <br/><br/>Not horrible, but you will probably be much happier with the Disney animated version."
"svorva","6","2","4","5 May 2017"," Tale as Old as Time, Review too Old to be Timely
","I was out of the country during Beauty and the Beast's opening. At the time I could care less, now I am a bit disappointed. There is no chance this review will scale the mountain of 600 more timely critiques. I'm not gonna get a single view. Back then I did not care, I was more interested in the reaction than the film itself. I already assumed the critical consensus would be mildly positive, the only question remaining was if audiences would be tired of a remake. Well, B&theB made budget on first weekend, so expect Disney live action remakes in the future. Still, popular pundits were unhappy. Beauty and the Beast was heralded as a pointless remake of a classic. Even as I wandered Shibuya ward with the soundtrack playing in the streets, I resolved to skip the film after returning stateside. Weeks later, I wake up to find my younger siblings have made plans to see a movie and that I am coming. So here I am, pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>You're a crusty bunch denizens of the internet. I, like you, agree that there is an increased burden of proof for remakes. However, many of you must have gone to the theater convinced you were going to have a lousy time. Beauty and the Beast is a tale as old as 1757 with films adaptations released around the globe since 1946. Does this retelling innovate and drive the narrative to new heights? Absolutely not, but I will claim that this iteration is entertaining and does enough to justify its existence.<br/><br/>The story and most songs remain the same. It's not a shot for shot remake, but if you had any problems with the animated classic, I doubt they went anywhere. Personally, I still think the first song ""Belle"" makes the title character appear as a brat. Does this immaturity validate Belle's growth and some character arch? Honestly, it has been two films and I am still not sure. Additionally, the Beast is not ugly. This conforms to the axiom that protagonists can never be hideous. It is an ongoing problem that has existed since the '46 version. No serious sins here. If you enjoyed the animated edition and are unallergic to a flagrant derivation there is nothing at the heart to despise. The additional 40 minutes of runtime is spent on a couple songs, a bit more Belle backstory, and most conspicuously some dimensionality to antagonist Gaston and his henchman Lefou. These clowns were pretty forgettable. Devoting additional time to expand these characters seems like a solid investment. Gaston's sick egocentrism and the yielding but aware Lefou are a worthwhile comedic duo. Unfortunately, the cornerstone of Beauty and the Beast is also the best argument for why the film should not exist. Emma Watson cannot sing. Her voice is excruciating enough to eject you from the world and back into your seat. Thankfully Belle does not participate in every song. Watson's acting between numbers is practical, but this is still awful casting. I don't think any more thought went into this decision beyond that a 160 million dollar picture needs a 16 million dollar face. Particularly painful is how easily this problem could have been fixed. The technology has existed for nearly 100 years. Dub her. Bigger actresses with better voices have been dubbed throughout Hollywood history and got over it. You think the sounds of rattling carts and the clomping horses were made by what you see on the screen? Movies are illusions.<br/><br/>Rant aside, I did enjoy Beauty and the Beasty. Beyond Watson's voice (okay I'm done now), is a lavish world. Fantasy, medieval, French. The budget did not wither away here. Every set is gorgeous and half the songs have 100s of elaborately choreographed extras. And the character design. Animation was once the only possible medium to realize Mrs. Potts, Lumiere, Cogsworth and Co, but now modern CGI is more than up to the challenge. Trailers do little justice. You certainly have never witnessed anthropomorphic furniture/dishware like this before. I never thought ""Be Our Guest"" would be matched in a remake. Too the purists I just insulted, maybe the original still remains supreme, but the fact they are comparable suggests this reimagining is worth your time. It's the same sense of bedazzlement. That feeling is worth more than original story. Beauty and the Beast only marginally expands character and narrative, but this potential shortcoming is compensated with visual ambition."
"verisww","4","2","4","30 April 2017"," Love the story but Miss Emma Watson is a miscast
","I always loved this story whether in a book, movie, play or made for TV movie. The scene stealer was Josh Cad as Lefou and I've never seen a better Gaston (played by Luke Evans). These two were the best comedy pair I've seen in a long time. I was surprised when I did not recognize who was playing Beauty's father for several scenes since I purposefully did not want to know the cast until I watched the movie. Great actors can do that and Kevin Kline never ceases to amaze me. I give only 4 stars because the title is ""The Beauty and The Beast"". Miss Emma Watson is pretty but I can think of dozens of others actresses that would better fit the bill as the ""Beauty"". I was hoping that when she got all dressed up she would transform into the Beauty my eyes were somehow missing but she only looked like an imposter. I love her but she was so miscast here that I assumed she was chosen for her amazing vocals only to be surprised, disappointed and even embarrassed for her. Embarrassed because she should have turned it down. It's obviously her popularity that got her the part. If I had never seen her in the Harry Potter films I would have even thought her to be a subpar actress. I don't think I'll ever get over it. Such ego. As for Dan Stevens as the Beast he was acceptable and I'm sure would have done better with a better casting of the ""Beauty"". Not very much chemistry there. If not for the miscasted ""Beauty"" I would have given it 8 stars. If the Beast were also better cast it could have been an easy 10 stars."

","Like most movies, every kind and well-beautiful beautiful princess lives in an environment where parents love their bullies. The beauties are very self-cultivated and courageous. They can still face fearlessly in the face of unknown scary beasts. Strive (to see the heartfelt admiration in this snack). It must be said that the beast also likes her very much (it is estimated that all men will like such a little girl with a personality), so she will let her be uncontrolled and let her go, even if she is late and did not kill her!

Recently, there have been many remakes of fairy tales, but so far the most my favorite is this one, which is full of all imagination of fairy tales.

","A little like ""Into the Woods"" (2014) this is a technically ambitious attempt to reconcile animation and live action with an excellent cast. Again, it works spectacularly as a piece of cinematic innovation - but has no spirit. We know the story: a vain Prince is cursed by a sorceress to remain shut up, hideously disfigured, in his castle until the spell is broken by true love's tear. ""Belle"" (Emma Watson) does well to keep this almost Ziegfeld-esque extravaganza on track. She manages to avoid the amorous intentions of Luke Evans as ""Gaston"" before ending up doing the prisoner swap for her father in the castle of the Prince - an extremely well made up Dan Stevens. The additional voice cast line up is great - Kevin Kline, Sir Ian McKellan, Ewan McGregor, Emma Thompson and Stanley Tucci. The songs are reprised from the 1991 version of the story but without the charm and mischief of their original iterations; they are just too precise and dare I say ""professional"". The technology has now super-subsumed every element of the process to the point that it is almost clinically delivered. The characters and story are still great, but please, Disney, leave something a little rough around the edges for us...."

The performances are mostly great, particularly Ewan McGregor as Lumiere stands out. Gaston lacks the fun and charisma of his animated counterpart, and his sidekick doesn't really get much of a chance to be amusing, but apart from that all the performances are strong.

","The film is based on Disney's 1991 animated movie of the same name. It tells the story of a girl Belle living with the prince cursed into a beast to rescue her father, and finally defeats magic with true love.
When I was a kid, I really loved this cartoon and felt that the characters are so beautiful. Although the monster is a monster, he is not afraid of him at all. Of course, I have to check out the newcomer edition, and it did not disappoint me. Many of these movies are afraid of destroying the original, but this one is really good. The prince has become a monster without love because of some things, but in fact he has love in his heart, but just needs someone to warm him.

","Hmm... I wasn't a huge fan of Emma Watson's performance in this, and her starring in this movie is perplexing to say the least because of how it's basically a story about a bookish girl developing Stockholm syndrome, even after her father had just been abused by the man/beast she falls for. Luke Evans as Gaston and Josh Gad as LeFou were pretty decent, but still left something to be desired. Don't get me wrong, this is a charming movie at all, and I felt it did a better job at capturing the spirit of its original version than the Aladdin remake did, but it was still a bit lackluster, and very focused on visual effects.<br/><br/>There was, however, one major standout here, and the thing that shone brightest, by far, was Dan Stevens's portrayal of the beast. His iconic manner of speaking and moving his body as he talks spoke the loudest in this film.

"BlueFox94","6","0","0","25 August 2018"," Ever Just the Same, Barely a Surprise in Beauty & the Beast
","Reviewing films like this remake of Disney's 1991 animated classic tends to frustrate me as a film critic who desires for films to stand as apart as possible while also cementing a unique footprint within all of cinema. That's a tough outlook, especially since the success of 2010's Alice in Wonderland and later releases Maleficent, Cinderella, and The Jungle Book has led Disney's live-action side to settle into a financial comfort zone of remaking classic films while setting artistic risk aside. I find it almost impossible to appraise these remakes without comparing them to their earlier (and demonstrably superior) animated iterations. Such is the case with director Bill Condon's live-action Beauty & the Beast, whose original 1991 animated film became the first ever animated nominee for the Academy Award for Best Picture - already an insurmountable bar for this live-action remake.<br/><br/>As with the 1991 animated version, the opening voice-over recounts a spoiled and selfish French prince (Dan Stevens) and the servants of his decadent castle who fall victim to the curse of an enchantress seeking shelter with only a rose as her payment. She turns the prince into a hideous beast, his servants into various household objects, and sets the fall of her rose's last petal as the deadline for the Beast to love and be loved in return or otherwise be cursed forever.<br/><br/>Years later, an inventor from the nearby village of Villeneuve named Maurice (Kevin Kline) gets lost and chased by wolves in the surrounding forest, before finding shelter in the castle. He then enrages the Beast when trying to pluck a rose from the garden for his headstrong and bookish daughter, Belle (Emma Watson). Belle desires a life beyond the boundaries of Villeneuve and away from the shallow affections of Gaston (Luke Evans), the village's narcissistic hunter. Belle manages to find her father and offers to replace him as the Beast's prisoner. The Beast warns her that she will live with him in the castle forever, which she accepts.<br/><br/>Belle initially views the cursed prince as nothing more than the beast that he is, while the Beast finds her too stubborn to respect. Yet, with the help of his servants - the charismatic Lumiere (Ewan McGregor), the strict Cogsworth (Ian McKellen), and the considerate Mrs. Potts (Emma Thompson) among them - she starts to warm to the Beast's cold-hearted exterior. Still, it's only a matter of time until either the drop of the last petal or for the persistent Gaston to threaten to have Maurice committed to the asylum if Belle refuses to marry him.<br/><br/>To start, this live-action remake clocks in at 129 minutes - about a half-hour longer than the animated film. Many over the years have noted the plot holes of the Disney adaptation such as the enchantress cursing the prince as a ten-year-old, the villagers' poor memory on the fate of the nearby castle, and the time Belle actually spends in the castle growing close to the Beast versus the struggle between her father and Gaston with the rest of the villagers. The animated film's shorter runtime and effortless pacing lacks the room for audiences to fully ponder over such story flaws during the viewing, but with the extra half-hour, the remake gives me that space to wonder about those plot holes.<br/><br/>Concerns about the narrative mistakes aren't remedied by most of the film and its retread of 1991, which tends to coast from song to song at the cost of the drama in between the music. From the lively ""Belle"", the glorious ""Gaston"", the uproarious ""Be Our Guest"", and the moving and magical title song, the existing (and heavily nostalgic) Alan Menken-composed and Howard Ashman-penned soundtrack remains fun to sing. Yet the songs still don't match the punch of 1991, especially with newly added instrumental breaks that pause the song (and the film) for the visual effects crew to momentarily grab the spotlight.<br/><br/>Of the actors, Luke Evans visibly commits to his portrayal of Gaston, despite lacking 1991's obvious brawn and the deep singing voice. Emma Watson as Belle takes some time to fully grow into her character (about the time when she makes a small squeal at the sight of the Beast's library), and even then she doesn't make the caring and brave character all her own, especially with her merely solid pipes. Dan Stevens' performance of the original song ""Evermore"" (lyrics by Tim Rice) serves as the rightful peak of his adequate screen time as the Beast. The household objects always feel physically present, even though Ewan McGregor (Lumiere) is no Jerry Orbach and Emma Thompson (Mrs. Potts) is no Angela Lansbury.<br/><br/>And then there's Josh Gad as LeFou.<br/><br/>I largely ignored, as with most news about the revelations of a character before a film's release, the Bill Condon's interviews that revealed that Josh Gad's LeFou will display same-sex attraction in the film. Upon seeing the film, I knew the performance certainly didn't meet the bar set by the controversy while providing some material for discussion. Jesse Corti's 1991 voice performance as LeFou perfectly captured the sidekick's loyal but pushover personality; however, Josh Gad as LeFou spends much of his screen time flashing piercing and longing looks at his friend of many years. Among several specific moments, LeFou remarks, ""It ain't gonna happen,"" to the various Gaston-fixated village women, and when Gaston wonders why his friend hasn't met a woman yet, LeFou replies that others find his ""clingy"" attitude as an obstacle. Gaston never reciprocates such affections, which does limit what LeFou can express in the film, but any knowledge of director Bill Condon's interviews will frame LeFou's screen time in a needlessly sexualized context and will overshadow this film for some time.<br/><br/>Past Disney remakes saw me leaving the theater with, at most, a feeling of vague satisfaction towards a lavish, but cinematically bland exercise - similar to repackaging over-performed greatest hits as new singles - but this controversy cements my overall underwhelming impression of this remake. I rank the 1991 film among the top five of the Walt Disney Animation Studios canon, so translating it to live action does little to stain my enjoyment of the material and my resulting star rating. Yet as I consider Beauty & the Beast's week-old cultural presence and study Disney's upcoming queue of live-action remakes, there exists in me a longing for the studio to instead use its resources for something bolder, riskier, newer - ""something there that wasn't there before.""<br/><br/>R.N.B."

However, I was sort of expecting something different from what I'd seen in the original, with the movie having had such a wide budget.<br/><br/>During the first scene in the movie, I could tell right away that this was just going to be an attempt at a copy of the original. Emma Watson (playing Belle) walked down steps into town just as Belle did in the original film. She began singing, and you could hear the terrible auto-tuning right away. It was not pleasant, and sounded way too electronic to stack up to the original. All of the other songs' auto-tuning was highly noticeable as well. There didn't seem to be much life in Emma Watson's character portrayal, as well as many of the others'. Not a great way to kick off a movie.<br/><br/>The movie gets rather boring, to the point where I stopped paying attention to it many times. I had thought that there were going to be more comedic elements between the characters in the film. If there were, they weren't noticeable. It seemed to have a much more serious tone to it than the original that I didn't expect from a Disney film.<br/><br/>Some of the character designs were rather strange; especially Mrs. Pott's. Chip could've added more comedy to the film, but he wasn't featured very much at all. I will say, that like many other reviews, my favorite character design/portrayal was that of Gaston's. I think that went over well since the movie was so serious, and his original tone was a serious one.<br/><br/>Now, not all of it was bad. If you're going for a romantic movie that holds a serious undertone, this is a good one to see. a lot of the scenery is great, and the castle design is wonderful, and the music without the auto-tuning was spectacular. Overall, it wasn't the worst movie I'd seen. It just wasn't what I was expecting. In my opinion, the characters are supposed to make the movie, and that was just kind of flat in this one."

","Small town girl Belle gives up her liberty to free her father from a Beast. She does not know that the captor is a selfish, loveless Prince. He was enchanted to remain a Beast until he discovers how to love. If he fails he will remain a Beast forever, together with his enchanted servants (tough on them, but there you go). Will Belle be the one to unlock the love within him before the last petal falls from the enchanted rose, and free them all? Or will vain Gaston, determined to marry an unwilling Belle, mess things up?<br/><br/>You already know the answer if you saw the hand-drawn animated version from 26 years ago. That was the first animated film to be nominated for the Best Film Oscar. So how does the remake compare, and does it stand on its own?<br/><br/>It is a handsome film. That's because the basic design - sets, locations, characters - is strongly based on the original. There is much more texture, of course. And Beast's castle is far more extensive. I liked the way that every time a petal falls, part of the castle crumbles: this explains why much of it is in ruins. And the characters, whether human or castle objects are very obviously based on their drawn counterparts.<br/><br/>I thought there were times when a location could have been used rather than a set, particularly in the woods, but this is a minor point.<br/><br/>The casting is very good. Each cast member fits their part. Most sing well, too - Emma Watson is good, but maybe lacks a little in technique and vocal strength. There has been comment on Josh Gad's gay-leaning LeFou. Well, OK, but it's very understated. There is also a crossdressing gag which is funny, but it's over before you realise it. Incidentally, Luke Evans' Gaston is NOT the size of a barge.<br/><br/>The film is inevitably loaded with CGI. As far as the household objects are concerned, this is superb. Lumiere, Cogsworth and co. are all animated superbly, look completely convincing, and integrate perfectly with sets and actors. The fight at the end is stunning.<br/><br/>I had no problems with the Beast, but I know there are some who find his CGI face unconvincing. I think young viewers will have no problem.<br/><br/>The story is familiar. Essentially unchanged from the animated version, it has some additional backstory. One of the reasons for seeing a remake is to discover the changes, so I will say no more about that. I thought the additions were worthwhile.<br/><br/>This is, first and foremost, a musical film. I am delighted to report that the wonderful songs and expected production numbers are all present. Alan Menken's glorious melodies include several new songs and also the soundtrack score. Tim Rice adds words for the new songs. The wonderful original lyrics by the late, and much-missed, Howard Ashman are augmented by some which were cut from the original film. My only criticism is that some of the lyrics of ""Gaston"" got lost in the mix of a rather raucous production.<br/><br/>There are some good 3D moments, but I wouldn't bother making an effort to see it in 3D.<br/><br/>There is much to enjoy here. Maybe it doesn't come up to the standard of its animated predecessor, but taken on its own I think it should find great success."

","They got the casting of the leads absolutely wrong. I remember Belle from the 1991 cartoon film being lively and cheerful and she had a sweet, calming voice. Emma Watson on the other hand, is still channeling her 'angry Hermione'. She maintains a scornful look and tone throughout the entire film. Also, she cannot sing in tune, her singing voice is worse than her speaking voice and the auto-tuning makes it totally disastrous. 
Listen to 'Days in the Sun' - Young Beast's (a 10-12 yr old boy) voice is indistinguishable from Belle's voice! For a long time, I thought it was Belle singing the opening of that song and later found out it was a young boy singing only when someone put up the lyrics with singers' names!<br/><br/>As for the Beast, they should have just had a guy in a suit. Also, did they digitally magnify Dan's voice to get that booming effect? Pathetic!<br/><br/>I would have rated this film much lower if not for the incredibly well cast enchanted objects. All of them have wonderful voices and they can sing as well. I particularly loved Audra McDonald and Emma Thompson's rendition of the title song. 'Be our Guest' was also very nicely done for my taste (I am not judging the French accent as I do not have a good ear for it)."

","Disney's latest live-action adaptation basically achieves what Cinderella did before it; provide a movie experience as rich and emotionally resonant as the original, with only minor improvements that serve the story to varying degrees of benefit.<br/><br/>Bill Condon's film succeeds most in adding substance to the main character's backstories, justifying their motivations for certain actions and decisions that seemed more questionable while watching the animated version. Visually, the production capitalises on its live-action nature by enhancing the period detail (the village and castle locations are much more immersive), and for all the timeless beauty that animation can offer, 'Be Our Guest' is undeniably all the better for the technical improvements which the special effects team could utilise this time around. Missteps include an attempt to flesh out the servant roles, resulting in plot threads that are too thin to warrant even the brief screen time afforded to them, and a failure to reach the dizzyingly poignant heights of the ballroom scene, which arguably was the film's primary task (at least for avid fans of the original).<br/><br/>Emma Watson takes some time to warm to as Belle - proving Harry Potter effectively taught her nothing - though as the emotional weight of the role bears down, so too does her performance improve. Opposite her, Dan Stevens manages so much more range despite only his eyes being visible.<br/><br/>Reviews for this remake, and the ones to come, are largely pointless. Visual splendour, memorable music and excellent storytelling are foregone conclusions, especially when the majority of the material is completely recycled. However, it does make these adaptations nostalgic, rousing affairs that are not only made for the cinema experience, but also guarantee that you aren't wasting the price of a ticket. That is, unless, you don't want to pay to watch what is effectively the same movie twice."

She had a lot to live up to so it was a halfway decent attempt. <br/><br/>I don't care to mention the rest since there was nothing really impressive anyway.

This is one of my favorite post-Harry Potter Emma Watson moments and while it kept me interested, it felt a little predictable. There were some parts that weren't predictable, but I'll leave that up to you to see.

"timothyalanwilliams","6","0","0","7 June 2017"," A Good, But Not Great Remake
","It's a tale as old as time...and this ""live action"" remake of the beloved animated ""Beauty and the Beast"" from 1991 wants desperately to pay homage to the original while adding its own spin. I will say up front that I loved the original and even owned the CD of the Broadway musical it spawned years later. This movie pulls from both as well as the original story. Does it work? At times. I will break down this review in three sections: Casting, music, and direction. Casting: Seeing as I'm not really a Harry Potter fan, I can't say I was all that ecstatic with the casting of Emma Watson. The movie didn't change my mind much. She sang well, but didn't do much else for me. Even her musical numbers felt flat with little expression on her face or in her body. Kevin Kline was excellent as her father Maurice even though his part felt limited. The real star of this movie was Luke Evans as Gaston. He was having so much fun and ate up every scene. The rest of the top-notch cast were fine with what they had to work with. Music: All of your favorites from the original are here (""Belle"", ""Be Our Guest"", ""Gaston"", etc) and a few new songs added as well. I enjoyed some of the new lyrics and arrangements that were added to the original songs. Nothing was taken away from them, which was good. The new songs were okay, but none will be as memorable as the originals. Direction: Bill Condon is no stranger to bringing musicals to the big screen as he previously directed ""Dreamgirls"" as well as ""Chicago"". So it's no surprise that this movie feels much more like watching a Broadway show than sitting in s movie theater. (One of my friends said the guy next to him would applaud after each musical number) The big musical numbers (""Belle"", ""Be Our Guest"", and ""Gaston"") were grand with extravagant visual effects and fun extras. Unfortunately Mr. Condon still struggles with is good CGI (he also directed the last two ""Twilight"" movies. For this to be ""live action"" just about every scene was computer animated in some way (and was blatantly noticeable). The beast, nor the household items, ever had much real expression. The backgrounds were clearly green- screened (George Lucas would be so proud). And the final scenes at the castle were so dark, you could barely make out what was happening between the beast and Gaston. The last thing I will mention is I would not recommend this to young children. I'm sure there are plenty of little girls (let's just say 10 and under) who love the cartoon are going to want to see it. But it's too long (over 2 hours) and at times can be too scary. My 7 year old got bored about halfway through. Several other young movie- goers in the theater seemed to lose interest at times as well. Overall, it was good but not great. I hope they do better with ""The Lion King""."
"CatDV","5","0","0","1 June 2017"," It was okay.
","STRENGTHS: The songs were good, especially the new ones. The story was good too as the movie filled up the empty spaces from the animated version. For instance, they explained the villagers' knowledge about the castle and the Royal Family, Belle's mother, the Beast's attitude, etc. It became more realistic in terms of story and character. Well...it IS the live-action version. The visuals were nice, the castle was good. The song gems were the Belle song and the Gaston Song. One of the great things they did here is that they really made the beast a prince, like his ""expensive education"" LOL they didn't remember that during the 1991 film where the beast was reading with Belle and he pronounced ""Two"" wrong. That was ridiculous.<br/><br/>By the way, a big applause for Luke Evans here. Josh Groban's Evermore? Beautiful<br/><br/>WEAKNESSES: They have quick pacing of dialogue or line throwing I guess... To those who have watched the 1991 beauty and the beast will definitely notice this, because they often did it to the familiar lines from the 1991 film. And yes I know that time is money... but still, there are a lot of moments where they just throw the lines without having a normal and human conversation pace. I'm not saying always, but often. I'm just saying... it's like they're being chased or something.<br/><br/>Madame Garderobe's singing is annoying sometimes. It was good at the starting song, but it then it kind of ruined the song, Days in the Sun and ""Tale as Old as Time"" at the finale. Belle's voice? Too auto-tuned LOL. It was like there was no absolute room for flaws. Belle's Dress? Disappointing. They did the effort with these magical effects for the designs with Garderobe, but it was still ugly. Sorry. I have nothing more to say to Ariana and John's karaoke session in Beauty and the Beast. It was tragic. For Celine Dion's ""How Does A Moment.."", it was a great rendition, BUT her accent got stronger, so you couldn't understand some lyrics.<br/><br/>As usual, the Be Our Guest song was too lengthy and dragging.<br/><br/>Overall, the film was okay. I would not want to compare the 1991 version to this one because they both have good points and bad points."
"dave-mcclain","8","7","24","16 March 2017"," ""Beauty and the Beast"" is a faithful, entertaining and beautiful live-action rendition of the beloved Disney animated classic.
","Most people are aware that Disney's 2017 musical fantasy ""Beauty and the Beast"" (PG, 2:09) is a live-action remake of the studio's 1991 animated classic, but what is not as well known is just how successful that 1991 version was – or how long the story has been around. According to Wikipedia, university researchers in Europe have traced the story's origins back 4,000 years! A little more recently, it's likely that the tale (which seems like it just may be nearly as old as time) was influenced by the true story of Petrus Gonsalvus, a 16th century Spaniard who suffered from Hypertrichosis (extreme hair growth), but married a Parisian woman, fathered seven children (four of whom inherited his disease) and lived among the French nobility. Regardless of its original source, the story was first published in France in 1740 and, over the next three centuries, was revised, rewritten and adapted, both in print and then as performance art, including about a dozen television shows and about the same number of feature films. Probably the most famous cinematic version was Disney's 1991 animated musical which won Oscars for its score and its title song (and was nominated for Best Picture – the very first animated feature so honored) and made almost half a billion dollars worldwide. That 1991 film incorporates several elements and plot points from the story's early published versions. The 2017 version does the same – and serves as a very faithful live-action re-telling of the 1991 classic, with few significant differences.<br/><br/>Emma Watson plays Belle (the character simply referred to as Beauty in most of the earlier versions of the story), a beautiful, kind, intelligent and independent young woman living in the fictional French village of Villeneuve (named after the author who first published the story). Belle lives with her eccentric and devoted widowed father, Maurice (Kevin Kline), who is the only one who understands Belle and accepts her for who she is. While her fellow villagers dismiss her as ""odd"" for always reading books and dreaming about life and adventures beyond Villeneuve, she is nevertheless being pursued romantically by arrogant former soldier Gaston (Luke Evans), who sees Belle's beauty as at least approaching his own. (To say that Gaston's narcissistic is like saying Donald Trump is kind of proud of his accomplishments.) And not that Gaston's ego needs any boosting, but constantly at his side is LeFou (Josh Gad), who basically serves as Gaston's hype man and who seems jealous of all the local maidens competing for Gaston's attention. Regardless, Gaston wants Belle and Belle wants... nothing to do with Gaston.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the other character in the film's title is wasting away in a long-forgotten castle deep in the woods outside of Villeneuve. Beast (Dan Stevens) is a former prince who is now a unique fusion of several different wild animals, due to a curse he received from a local enchantress because of his extreme self-centeredness. Trapped in the same curse are his former castle staff, who now exist as anthropomorphic household objects including a candelabra named Lumière (voiced by Ewan McGregor), a clock called Cogsworth (Ian McKellan), a tea pot (Emma Thompson), a harpsicord (Stanley Tucci), a dresser (Audra McDonald) and a feather duster (Gugu Mbatha-Raw). The only way that any (all) of them can be released from the curse is if Beast falls in love and is loved in return, before a rose that was given to Beast as a symbol of the curse loses its last petal. Considering that Beast has grown bitter and mean and no one even knows that he exists, the long-term prospects for this cursed castle don't look good.<br/><br/>Of course, all that changes when these two worlds inevitably collide. (After all, movies simply called ""Beast"", or ""Beauty And"" don't sound very interesting, do they?) When Maurice gets lost in the woods on the way back from his annual trip to market, he ends up at Beast's castle, where he takes a rose to bring to Belle and is promptly imprisoned in Beast's dungeon. When Maurice's faithful horse returns to Villeneuve and Belle hops on, she also discovers Beast's castle. She insists on taking her father's place in the dungeon, so Beast throws him out and holds Belle captive. As Maurice struggles to get Gaston (or any of the villagers) to help him rescue Belle (or even to believe his story of a beast living in a castle deep in the woods), Beast's staff insists that Belle be their guest, and they work to convince Beast to be nice enough to her that she might turn out to be the one to break the curse before it's too late.<br/><br/>""Beauty and the Beast"" is a faithful, entertaining and beautiful live-action rendition of the beloved Disney animated classic. The 2017 version keeps the time-honored songs from the 1991 film and adds a few new ones. With the advances in CGI since 1991, director Bill Condon and his team are able to replicate and update the look of the animated version. In addition, the great voice work wonderfully complements the vibrant visuals, while the characters' diversity (in terms of race and sexual orientation) also represents an update of sorts. The result of all this is a remake that is every bit as magical and fun as the original. There is little here that's fresh or new, but there's a lot to appreciate and enjoy. ""A-"""

","Disney's ""Beauty and the Beast"" is a re-telling of the studio's animated classic which refashions the classic characters from the tale for a contemporary audience, staying true to the original music while updating the score with several new songs.

When her eccentric father Maurice (Kevin Kline) goes missing, she tracks him down to an ancient castle, where he's been taken captive by the resident Beast (Dan Stevens), who's been living under a curse imposed by a conjuror who wants him to discover the beauty within himself, and will only be free of it when someone loves him for who he is. He makes Belle take the place of her father, and this sets them both on a course of discovery and magic.<br/><br/>It seems to be a current trend for animated Disney classics to be getting live action, what with this and the recent Jungle Book adaptation, and since everything else seems to be getting remade, why not jump on the bandwagon? There is some undeniable potential in a LA version of the animated 1991 Disney film, and Bill Condon has not done a terrible job of doing so, just one that is quite notably devoid of the charm and joy of the original, and can never quite sweep you along with the same sense of wonder.<br/><br/>An all star cast, comprised of a load of hot, young talent in the main roles and a load of seasoned, accomplished actors in the supporting roles, add to the veneer and sleekness of it all, and aesthetically it's all very nice. The special effects, costume designs and production values are all marvellous, and combine to create a visually splendorous experience that sets the senses on fire, if nothing else.

","Unfortunately, this is yet another example of the drought of ideas Disney has been wallowing in for the last several years; you would think a scene-for-scene remake of a much beloved classic animation would be a shoe-in, and indeed, it was in initial box office.<br/><br/>The director, Bill Condon (who directed the last two Twilight movies, and it shows) is teamed up with Hermoine Granger's less charismatic real-life identity Emma Watson, Gandalf who I hope they paid for in his weight in gold, Obi-Wan who had issues with dialect, Olaf from Frozen reprising his role as an annoying sidekick, Matthew Crawley, Shaw who has been downgraded to a single horsepower, The Divinations/Tea Lady from Harry Potter.. I have a very hard time seeing this movie as anything but a shameless cash-grab, engineered to get 20-somethings in the seats while attracting older audiences with the dreaded Nostalgia Goggles.<br/><br/>Acting: For such a star-studded, highly paid, respectable acting lineup, the result is a flat and uninspired mess; the scenes feel rushed, the actors seem lost and aloof. I can only assume, since Breaking Dawn suffered from similar issues, that this falls mostly on the mantle of direction.<br/><br/>Emma Watson is terrible; her Belle is lifeless, emotionless, and not endearing enough for the subject matter; her singing is typically a quarter-step off key, with that familiar Antares Autotune 10k hiss; why they did not provide a vocal double for her is a mystery. I also understand from the trivia section of this page that Watson was given far too much creative control over the character, seemingly inserting herself into the role instead of properly characterizing Belle. Given that she was a sequential cast member in Harry Potter - who was guaranteed a role in each film - this seems to be a visual casting choice instead of a role-based one. <br/><br/>Dan Stevens seems lost in his role, as most of the other actors, with his face replaced by an Uncanny Valley baking pan with about half the emotion; principal filming featured his face with make up and prosthetic, something that could have potentially conveyed the deep, stirring emotions required for this role, though I do not know for sure. Maybe he was unable to emote with the make-up. Either way, the overt CGI fails to do much else but distract. He is lost within it, though he is aptly expressive as the Prince.<br/><br/>Luke Evans does not seem blustery or bombastic enough for the role of Gaston, though the characterization is likely a large part of this flaw; unlike the animated film, Gaston does not evolve here, and is instead a complete ""baddie"" from the beginning. You are left wondering if he grew to insanity because he was enamored with Belle, or maybe, sustained a frontal-lobe brain injury in that war he and LaFou allude to in the pub scene.<br/><br/>Ewen McGregor obviously had a very hard time with the accent, given how separate a Scottish dialect and Proventcial Parisian accent are; he himself characterized the accent as sounding too ""Mexican"" in principal filming. Why they did not hire a French actor is anyone's guess, but as I stated before, this seemed more to be about casting a 'recognizable' than someone who actually fit the role.<br/><br/>Though his acting was without major flaws, Ian McKellen He seems a bit stiff for the role of Cogsworth; though McKellen he was offered the original role in the animated film, David Ogden Stiers brought a playfulness to that performance that was somewhat missing in this re-adaptation.<br/><br/>Josh Gad was basically reprising his role as Olaf, though tuned down to reflect LaFou better; as with most of the other actors, he seemed a bit lost, both in emotion and performance that smacked of poor direction. He does what he can, though the background story of the character seemed to muddy the overall performance.<br/><br/>Everyone else in the production appears to be trying their best with what they've been dealt - poorly formed characters, muddy backstories, and disorganized material.<br/><br/>Writing: The writing was a bit all over the place. In an attempt to ""zip up"" all the loose ends and fan-fueled speculation, they only succeeded in making the story more confusing and difficult to follow or engage. I cannot imagine how difficult this was for very young children to pay attention.<br/><br/>Music: This is why I gave it more than one star; the music is genuinely written well, with Menken coming back to the production as a creativity consultant. It is regrettable that their primary lead, Emma Watson, cannot sing.<br/><br/>Conclusion: This film failed on many levels to deliver even half of the emotional impact of the animated classic. Those who grew up with this story will not be impressed by this adaption, as it meanders into confusing and loquacious territory without a concrete point; younger audiences, who may be courted by the acting roster, will be left with a flat emotional impact from actors they are accustomed to delivering stellar performances in other works. The music is good, some of the visuals are, though many have texture issues as well as dipping far into Uncanny Valley creepiness, delivering poorly on the emotions required to properly tell this story - a story about who we are inside, verses who we appear to be, ironically.<br/><br/>Author's Note: Though not terribly important, it appears that Watson has undergone Botox or has forgotten how to move 75% of her face since the HP movies; as a person who received years of therapeutic Botox injections, I side with the former. He inability to emote properly drastically impedes an already wooden performance. I did not much care for her post-modern feminist assertions that were mostly nonsensical, such as refusing to don a corset in the ballroom scene; this would make a bit more sense, has she not chosen a lead role in a glorified tribute to Stockholm Syndrome."

I love Harry Potter so Emma Watson who plays Belle who is perfect for the role, they are so alike. They both like to read, charming, well liked, friendly and lovable. The Beast played by Dan Stevens was a jerk at first because he was a Prince who got everything and didn't show any love towards anyone and a witch cursed him to be a Beast until he finds love. I will admit the make up and CG in the film looked pretty rushed and a bit lacking in some of the Disney films you normally see. <br/><br/>Luke Evans who plays Gaston is a jerk because he thinks everyone should kiss his butt and love him but Belle doesn't want him because let's be honest he's a butt. And Josh Gad who I can't really stand plays the gay dude LeFou who is clearly in love with Gaston but since it's a Disney film they can't show that. Some will say he's just flamboyant in his mannerism but he clearly in love with Gaston which is fine but it was a bit much. <br/><br/>Now onto some of my favorite characters who come to live like the Lumiere who is a candlestick, Cogworth who is a clock and Chip that's a teacup who come to live to help Belle feel more at home in the castle that she's basically trapped in until the Beast who is played Dan Stevens who needs to learn how to love before he can become human. This is no easy task when you've been closed off for years but the Beast will learn throughout the movie to be more caring and understanding towards someone.<br/><br/>Now the music in the film I loved the soundtrack I went out and bought it the moment the film was over. My favorite songs which you'll love are Belle (one of my favorite), Be Our Guest, Day In The Sun, and Something There (is so romantic) which are some of the songs that are memorable in the film. <br/><br/>Should you watch this film? Hmm it's up to you, if you loved the animation film then yes you'll love this film. If you're not sure then rent it from Redbox, view it and some Redbox will let you purchase the film if you like it. I personality enjoyed it so I hope you give it a chance. <br/><br/>Thanks for reading my reviews."

","""Beauty and the Beast"" is a 2017 musical romantic fantasy remake of a 1991 animated film of the same name. It is directed by Bill Condon (""Twilight: Breaking Dawn"" parts 1 & 2) and is written by Stephen Chbosky (""Perks of Being a Wallflower"") and Evan Spiliotopulos (""Huntsman: Winter's War""). The music is by Alan Menken (""Aladdin""); the cinematography by Tobias A. Schliessler (""Dreamgirls""); the editing by Virginia Katz; and the production by David Hoberman (""Monk"") and Todd Lieberman (""The Fighter""). It stars Emma Watson (""Harry Potter""), Dan Stevens (""Downton Abbey""), Luke Evans (""Clash of the Titans""), Kevin Kline (""Sophie's Choice""), Josh Gad (""Modern Family""), Stanley Tucci (""The Lovely Bones""), Audra McDonald (""Private Practice""), Evan McGregor (""Star Wars""), Gugu Mbatha-Raw (""Doctor Who""), Ian McKellen (""X-Men""), and Emma Thompson (""Sense and Sensibility""). Filming began May 18, 2015 in Surrey, England with an estimated budget of $160 million, and a box office totaling at $1.103 billion internationally. It has a running time of 2 hours, 19 minutes (139 minutes), and a PG rating for mild violence. Now to the review:<br/><br/>Belle (Emma Watson) is a gorgeous, kind, and smart young woman living in a small- minded village in France. Despite constant wooing from village heartthrob Gaston (Luke Evans) Belle keeps her feisty independence and devotion to intellect. Her father Maurice (Kevin Kline) goes on a ""trip"" (Doing God knows what, that's never really explained), and she asks for a rose. Maurice ends up getting lost in the woods, and comes upon a castle where, unbeknownst to him, a cursed Beast (Dan Stevens) and his staff reside. Maurice is captured by the enraged Beast, and Belle, learning of her father's disappearance, goes to the castle and trades her freedom for his. Slowly, Belle and Beast fall in love, while a frazzled Maurice searches for help to rescue her. He finally gains the trust and help of Gaston and his lackey LeFou (Josh Gad). <br/><br/>So here's what I think it boils down to. Something as beloved and treasured as '91's B+B should not ever be made into a remake without taking all possible precautions. You need a Belle who can sing and act, a beast who looks fairly realistic, a CGI castle that actually looks plausible, and you need an interesting and captivating script/plot. Otherwise, the project should not be taken on.<br/><br/>Obviously, this will be a huge box office hit. And I understand. No one is immune to some nostalgia, especially from an amazing original animated film. But I miss the times when cinema had standards. I miss the clever and impactful films Disney used to make. If we are meeting films like this with widespread approval, then what messages are we sending for future Disney films?<br/><br/>Here is Watson, when asked why her Belle specifically, is a feminist:<br/><br/>""So, we created a backstory for her, which was that she had invented a kind of washing machine, so that, instead of doing laundry, she could sit and use that time to read instead. So, yeah, we made Belle an inventor.""<br/><br/>Now, I guess one could say that that this is a slight improvement (no matter how unnecessary) on Belle. But why? What more is being said? ""Hey, not only can she read, but she also can build things too! Now that's what I call a feminist princess!"" <br/><br/>But Belle was already a feminist princess. A bit outdated considering our times, sure. But if you're going around flaunting the term ""Feminist Belle,"" then I expect more than one 1.5 minute scene where she's using her washing machine, and then a 30 second clip in which that same machine is destroyed. God, what is your point? What more is this bringing? What thought is this provoking? <br/><br/>Now, I think the idea of revamping a feminist Belle is great. I do, really. Watson had great intentions. But if this is all we're getting, then what's the point if you're adding so little?<br/><br/>3/10<br/><br/>30% <br/><br/>F"

"Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187","7","3","8","6 April 2017"," Adequate but unnecessary remake of Disney's '91 Classic.
","Beauty and the Beast is the most recent installment in Disney's ever-growing library of live-action remakes based on the company's famous animated movies of 'yore'. Why is Disney doing this again? To keep its non-Marvel, non-Star Wars, and non-Pixar stuff relevant with the times. For the most part, Beauty works well in updating its classic Best Picture-nominated precursor. But it's mostly pointless and practically shot-by-shot and beat-by-beat remake that introduces just enough material to justify its existence. And the original is STILL a modern film by today's standards.<br/><br/>There's some truly pretty moments here and there, but because this film is live-action, you can feel the painfully obvious reality that THIS Beauty and the Beast film lacks the energy and expression of the 1991 original. Despite all the CGI-fueled imagery helping give some extra life to some of the set-pieces, we've seen these pieces before in the original. 'Be Our Guest' is personally the piece I consider to stand out the most in this interpretation. Ewan McGregor does have a unique singing voice: I'll give him that.<br/><br/>This growing trend in Disney does seem to be working, I understand why they're pursuing remaking their own movies, but how far can you go once you've run out of animated movies to remake? They can't last and work forever. I'm guessing that there'll be a remake of The Little Mermaid starring Sophie Turner as Ariel or something, and Melissa McCarthy as Ursula; or Henry Cavill as Prince Eric? Michael B. Jordan as Sebastian? *Groan* Disney, please keep focusing on Star Wars for the time being. And don't lose sight of the greatness Pixar affords your company in the field of originality and creativity.<br/><br/>Anyway, Beauty and the Beast: the first truly interesting successor to the original 1991 film (the straight to DVD sequel vermin can FINALLY be forgotten: for good)!"
"davidarcher","5","3","8","2 April 2017"," The animated version is better - and shorter
","The animated Beauty and the Beast is one of the few movies I own on DVD*. I had high hopes for the live action version, but alas, it was not meant to be.<br/><br/>With a running time of 129 minutes, the new version is over 50% longer than the animated version – and it feels like it. The movie seems padded and I know I fell asleep at least once. (I kept imagining the Disney exec's telling the producers: ""We've spent a fortune on sets, costumes and set dressings, and damn it, we want to get our money's worth."") Having said that, the production design IS gorgeous, but oftentimes seems to take the place of story and plot.<br/><br/>As to the cast, I've never understood Emma Watson's appeal, Dan Steven's Beast is mostly CGI (as obviously are the castle's inhabitants) so that leaves Luke Evans as a very good bad Gaston, and Josh Gas as his conflicted sidekick.<br/><br/>The movie briefly comes to life with the three big productions number of Belle, Gaston and especially Be Our Guest. The closing cast credits are equally good, but it's a long wait to get to them<br/><br/>Some of the CGI is surprisingly poor, such as the sequence towards the end when the Beast is swinging along the castle's rooftop. And, the cinematography is downright vertiginous in a couple of shots where the camera pans and tilts from the castle to the surrounding countryside.<br/><br/>See it now if you have kids or love the story. Otherwise, wait for the DVD, watch the three big musical numbers and the closing credits, and call it good."
"marcosgdmo","5","3","8","27 March 2017"," A good tribute to a great film, but forgettable
","What can you do when you have to remake one of the greatest animated films ever made by Disney into a Live Action Motion Picture? The risks are many. This films manages to recreate the great music and the entertainment value of the original one, but fails to recreate its essence or create a new one. In terms of Character development, it has some troubles with the main characters. They are sympathetic, but the depth behind them is flat. Emma Watson's performance is pretty disappointing, this is pretty obvious with the poor screenplay written for her role. The supporting characters are other story, they are part of what keeps this film going, besides the great music. Talking about visual effects, the movie keeps the great work we saw in ""The Jungle Book"", maybe not as stunning, but still pretty good.<br/><br/>In summary, this film despite of being entertaining, it fails to stand on its own, paying the price of being loyal to the original. I have to say, this is understandable, but stills a problem.<br/><br/>I would say this is a good film, but feels small compared to the masterpiece of the animated version"
"cuthbertjoel","6","3","8","26 March 2017"," Just watch the original
","The original of this film is probably up there in my Top 10 of all time, so I knew this remake would not be as good. All I wanted was for this one to not desecrate my childhood memories of the original. By that measure, this film was a success. It isn't so bad that it ruins the original.<br/><br/>All actors play their role reasonably well, and for me the standout being Luke Evans as Gaston and Emma Watson did a decent job as Belle. Disney brought its usual flavour of production and most of the original songs translated adequately to the live-action format. The opening number, 'Belle' worked the best in my opinion. However, some of the songs really paled in comparison to their original counterparts. 'Be Our Guest' I thought was the weakest of the lot. Disney also shoe-horned in a few new songs which for me didn't really add anything. Also, a few plot differences and new script twists seem to have been manufactured just to make the film a little less of a carbon copy of the original.<br/><br/>Leaving the cinema though, I could only see this film as a pretty vanilla, paint-by-numbers rerun, which in no way exceeded the original. In that sense, I end up thinking, what was the point of this? Are Disney simply just going to go through their back catalogue re-releasing things as live action? It seems that might be the case. <br/><br/>There's certainly nothing new here, and nothing that makes the animation look dated or comparatively weaker. As a stand-alone film, I wish I could think of a better adjective than 'OK', but that is simply how the film makes me feel. It will no doubt make the Disney shareholders happy as it will rake money in, but for us that hold the original in such high regard, this is a second-rate copy."
"spasek","6","3","8","24 March 2017"," Live Version Falls Well Short of the Animated Classic!
","The animated version of Beauty & the Beast is my favorite Disney film of all time. Frankly, I was excited to hear about the live action version, and I was anxious to see it. Unfortunately, this live action version is a pale, paltry comparison to its animated predecessor. In fact, it's not really even that close.<br/><br/>Those who have seen the original will find very few surprises here aside from a few minor changes here and there. <br/><br/>First of all, Emma Watson just doesn't have it in her to play Belle. Belle is a young woman who is a dreamer, but she is also full of life. Watson portrays Belle as a girl with a mild interest in, well, anything! She seldom smiles, and she almost looks bored. Also, Watson isn't incapable of singing, she just isn't great. With a sea of actresses out there who can act AND sing, how hard would it have been to cast someone who can do both? Disney was obviously banking on Watson's popularity to put people in the seats. They made a mistake. Everyone knows that if your product is good enough, people will show up.<br/><br/>The Beast, in many ways, is even worse. The CGI people forgot to give Beast any emotional expression. He growls and sneers a few times, but mostly, he has a disinterested look about him. It's really sad that both Watson and Stevens/CGI were unable to tap into what makes these iconic characters so likable and easy to relate to. They also have virtually no romantic chemistry whatsoever. So, when the epic climax comes when Belle confesses her feelings, Watson conveys it as if she's simply reading it without any emotional feelings at all. <br/><br/>The special effects are impressive, but as with so many films today, special effects without compelling characters pretty much means that your film is going to be very shallow. This is just another reason why the film is flat, as many other reviewers have pointed out.<br/><br/>One of the bright spots is Luke Evans' Gaston. I almost wish that there had been more of him. Evans can act AND sing! At least someone in this film is able to do both aside from Evans and Ewan McGregor. Kevin Kline, a veteran of the stage, is also solid as Belle's father, Maurice as well as Ian McKellan's Cogsworth. <br/><br/>The songs are all intact, and frankly, the best one is Ewan McGregor singing ""Be Our Guest."" Emma Watson's contributions are just way too amateurish and lack any kind of range. <br/><br/>All in all, Beauty and the Beast was a disappointment, especially given the level of expectations and also knowing what Disney is capable of. Disney fails in this attempt. I really hope they put more effort into Aladdin than they did this one, or the epic trilogy of Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and Lion King are going to end up being a trilogy of emptiness and failure."
"Darkhorse_Knight","5","3","8","23 March 2017"," DHKR: Beauty and the Beast (2017)
","TL;DR version: This is probably going to be one of my most conflicted reviews I've ever written. On the one hand, I get to talk trash about another live action remake from Disney. On the other hand, it also has a lot of things going for it that I could even consider it to be a huge improvement to the disaster that was Cinderella (2015). Please keep in mind this is also after some time of recollecting the film and comparisons to the 1991 animated version, so take this review with a grain of salt.<br/><br/>With that in mind, let's get on with it.<br/><br/>This movie does not exactly do the original justice by any stretch of the word. Many parts of it unfortunately felt as if it was more of a hollow shell of what it could've potentially been, and that's probably the worst thing going for it. Well, there a three parts to why it does not stand to the original, and one of which might not affect your viewing pleasure, or displeasure.<br/><br/>One major problem was mostly in regards of how it tries to lengthen the story and how it also somehow drains it of what made it so good in the first place. It's pretty much a word for word, copy-pasted version of the animated movie, just with extra bits and songs added in to lengthen it's runtime. In many cases, it didn't really work out, and it gave me some flashbacks of Cinderella (2015). Songs that were added in this case were executed poorly to the point where it felt as if they were added in mere days before release. There was, however, a good use of added time where it did seem to work in a shocking emotional gut punch, but it's small compared to the unfortunately lacking remainder of the story it leads to.<br/><br/>Another problem, which was actually a variable, was the use of 3D. Seeing this in an IMAX theatre, 3D glasses and all with everything going on, it is enough to make you nauseas. Whether it was the scene involving a snowball(which, spoiler alert, was the only reason it was probably released for 3D, no joke), or just how most of the film was just moving all over the place in speed, that might make give you a small migraine at best, and close to getting you sick Worst Case Scenario. this is only with the 3D version, so if you were to go to the movie, I would probably recommend seeing it in 2D.<br/><br/>The third and probably the worst problem going for it was the look of it. It's a beautiful looking movie, don't get me wrong, but it's still chuck full of some of the worst looking, uncanny kinds of CGI I had seen. It tries to make these figures as realistic as possible and have them look somewhat human as well. In some cases, it looks OK, like with Lumierre, and maybe Cogsworth. In others, it was downright scary to the point where i wouldn't recommend this to young children.(Chip STILL creeps me the heck out!) Outside of CGI, the Beast's look was pretty underwhelming as well. Rather than a menacing monster, it looks more like a guy in a furry body suit. It's impressive, and props to the designers for making him look as real as he could, but all I see is more of a thin, brown version of Asgore Dreemurr from Undertale rather than the Beast as most would probably recognize.<br/><br/>It's sad. At first, I really thought this was going to be a good film, which it still can be at many times. Characters are pretty much the same from the original, and it dosen't bastardize Belle like the other Live Action movie did so with Cinderella, and it actually made her a bit more dynamic here. Gaston is still the braggart, womanizing hunter, if a little toned down, and the Beast is also still the kind of broken-hearted monster that learns to love. All of it is still there. However, when stacked up to the original, I honestly can't see any real contest. It has good moments, and it has terrible ones, but overall it's more of a sad, underwhelming film that had great potential. <br/><br/>C-Ranking, 2.5/5 Stars."

","'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST': Four Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>Disney's live-action remake of their 1991 hit animated musical, of the same name; which was based on the eighteenth-century fairy tale, also of the same name, by Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont. The film tells the classic story of a woman who falls in love with the beast that imprisons her, in an enchanted French castle. It stars Emma Watson, Dan Stevens (of 2014's 'THE GUEST' fame), Luke Evans, Josh Gad, Kevin Kline, Ewan McGregor, Stanley Tucci, Ian McKellen, Emma Thompson, Gugu Mbatha-Raw and others. It was directed by Bill Condon (who also helmed 'THE TWILIGHT SAGA: BREAKING DAWN - PART 1' and '2', as well as the musical 'DREAMGIRLS'), and it was scripted by Evan Spiliotopoulos and Stephen Chbosky (who also wrote and directed 'THE PERKS OF BEING A WALLFLOWER', also costarring Emma Watson). The film has been a huge hit at the Box Office so far, and it's also gotten mostly positive reviews from critics. I mostly enjoyed it as well.<br/><br/>Belle (Watson) lives in the village of Villeneuve, with her father Maurice (Kline). She is harassed constantly by a popular, and extremely arrogant, former soldier named Gaston (Evans); who desperately wants to marry her. One day, on a trip to the market, Maurice gets lost in the woods and stumbles upon an old castle. He's then attacked, and imprisoned there, by a beast that lives in the castle (Stevens), for stealing a rose from the garden. When Maurice's horse rushes to Belle for help, she returns with it to the castle and offers to take her father's place, in order to free him. The Beast accepts her offer, against Maurice's wishes, and Maurice is set free. Belle slowly begins to sympathize with her captor, as she learns how he, and his staff, were transformed into a monster, and a bunch of inanimate objects, by a powerful enchantress. She also later learns, that only true love can break their curse.<br/><br/>The 1991 animated film is one of my favorite Disney animated movies (excluding Pixar), I remember fondly when it was shockingly nominated for Best Picture (at the Academy Awards for that year). I haven't seen it in a while, so I don't remember for sure how faithful this live-action remake is, but it seems pretty faithful to me (there's a few things I noticed that were probably changed though). One of the most notable changes, to the original animated film, is the controversial inclusion of an openly gay character (played by Josh Gad in the movie). I think his character definitely makes the film more entertaining (and Gad is great in the role). I definitely can't say I enjoyed this new version as much as I remember liking the Disney animated classic, but it is a pretty entertaining and well made update.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/Y0XE5jyxMFQ"

","Keep in mind that it has been many years since I've seen the animated classic, but I really thought this stayed pretty true to the cartoon. There are some scenes that parents may not want their kids to see - the wolf attack and the fight between Gaston and the Beast stay pretty true to the animated movie, but seeing that in live action may be traumatizing to little kids.<br/><br/>I do have a bit of a beef with this movie, though its a complaint I have with much of Hollywood. This movie takes place in France, and yet the actors/characters are British. Hollywood seems to think there are two nationalities - American and British. Lets broaden our perspectives, people!"
"jaywensley2004","5","3","8","21 March 2017"," Left me cold
","This romance failed at being romantic. Weak dialogue, too much focus on distractingly massive musical production numbers, a lack of chemistry between Belle and her CGI construct Beast, and a frantic pace created in editing, all contributed to a lack of affection or sense of connection to the characters or their relationship.<br/><br/>The film is absolutely lovely to look at, but for me it was almost unbearable to watch. The verbal exchanges often made me cringe when they weren't annoyingly banal. I think the script was dumbed-down to what the producers hoped would be comprehensible to a very preteen audience. But I suspect that all most children will notice is the spectacle and some clever CGI animated characters. Even a teenager probably won't perceive any romance in the film.<br/><br/>As for the music, it is of course, familiar...unfortunately. BECAUSE I am familiar with the brilliant performances in the original, animated version of ""Beauty and the Beast,"" I had that superior soundtrack to compare with this version. Emma Watson's vocals are credible, although they were often noticeably auto-tuned. And I would not expect to hear her performing in any animated production where the singing could be done by a superior voice. All the other numbers were at the level of a middling live theater cast with nothing standing out. Even the title song failed in it's role as a ""show-stopper.""<br/><br/>All in all, this live-action ""Beauty and the Beast"" is the most disappointing, unsatisfying Disney film this Disney fanatic has every watched."
"YourFamilyExpert","8","3","8","21 March 2017"," Pales in comparison, but solid on its own
","WHAT'S BEAUTY AND THE BEAST ABOUT?<br/><br/>Disney updates their 1991 animated classic about a bookish beauty who falls for a monstrous beast.<br/><br/>IS IT ANY GOOD? (GRADE: B+)<br/><br/>It won't be nominated for Best Picture like the original, but what this new Beauty and the Beast does right makes up for its flaws. Lets get the latter out of the way. Emma Watson struggles a bit out of the gate; she seems to have a decent voice, but director Bill Condon (Dreamgirls) is unwilling for us to hear any flaws and she's noticeably auto- tuned. Watson shines in subtler, more intimate moments of kindness and affection, so she's great whenever she's interacting with her father, falling for Beast, or bonding with the castle furniture/servants. She's no Julie Andrews, however, and her solo musical monologing leaves something to be desired.<br/><br/>The film also sticks a little too closely to the 1991 film, fearful to establish itself as something unique as did 2015's fantastic Cinderella. Swaths of dialogue and musical cues are lifted wholesale and this version can only suffer in comparison to a bona fide classic. <br/><br/>What works? Almost everything else. Like I said, Watson does fine work in many parts of the film. Even though this movie copies the original in many respects, it usually does a decent job of it. I found myself most enchanted, however whenever it went ""off book"" and did something new, such as integrating less-familiar songs from the stage musical, offering some gorgeous brand-new tracks, patching up plot holes, and providing well-conceptualized backstories to both Belle and Beast that effectively deepen their bond and develop them as characters. <br/><br/>The cast is excellent. Dan Steven's Beast is magnetic; while the motion-capture animation is occasionally less-than convincing, the performance is nearly flawless and rich with emotion. Kevin Kline's Maurice is less of a crackpot and more of a steady, loving father here; his relationship with Belle is very moving. Luke Evans proves an inspired choice for Gaston; not burly and moronic like his animated counterpart, here he's more of an intelligent narcissist trying to keep his darker nature in check, making his ultimate failure all the more chilling.<br/><br/>Josh Gad's LaFou is much more sympathetic here than he was in the 1991 film, loyal to Gaston but nagged by an ever-growing conscience. The castle servants were a highlight for me; when you have actors like Emma Thompson, Ian McKellin, Ewan McGregor, Audra McDonald, and Stanley Tucci you really can't go wrong.<br/><br/>Visually the film is a wonder. The music is generally fantastic. This new film is sure to delight fans of the story and win over a new generation. I'd not be surprised if repeat viewings cause me to warm to it even more. It only suffers in direct comparison to the original, but as a standalone it satisfies. <br/><br/>IS IT OKAY FOR YOUR KIDS?<br/><br/>Beauty and the Beast is rated PG. There are some intense and frightening moments in which wolves menace various people and attack Beast. Speaking of the titular love monster, he is frightening and intimidating in several scenes. A man punches another man unconscious and leaves him for dead. A character is shown to be dying of disease. Beast is shot by Gaston several times and hit in the head with a stone fixture. Characters drink alcohol in a tavern. Before being turned into Beast, the prince is shown leering over several maidens at a dance. As for the so-called ""gay controversy,"" it's much ado about nothing. LaFou is portrayed as effeminate. The opera singer chest of drawers attacks three men, dressing them in women's clothing; two are mortified, one comically enjoys it. Later, while rotating dancing partners LaFou bumps into that man (who's no longer dressed as a woman) and they smile at each other. That's it. <br/><br/>ANY WORTHWHILE MESSAGES<br/><br/>Only through accountability, humility, and contrition can we change our natures. Do not judge based on outward appearance; rather, consider a person's character. It's never too late to do the right thing."

I feel he really saved this movie for me, other wise it would have been 3 stars but he is meant to be the baddie! 2)Yes Emma is beautiful and does look like I would imagine Belle, however her signing sounded really strained and unnatural and made me wish it would stop. 3) Mrs. Potts, Chip,Lumiere and Cogsworth - what happened to you!!!

While watching ""Beauty and the Beast"", I kept picturing Emma Watson (as Belle) doing some magic trick that her most famous character would've done; Ian McKellen (as Cogsworth) saying something about the One Ring; and Ewan McGregor (as Lumiere) trying to use the Force. Yeah, that's the kind of person that I am.<br/><br/>As to the controversy of LeFou turning out to be gay, what I ask is why some people are OK with a story that's basically a glamorization of Stockholm syndrome but aren't OK with a gay guy. Never mind that these same people will read their children the Bible (which contains rape, incest and murder). These people announced their plans to boycott the movie, but I doubt that'll harm Disney's bottom line.<br/><br/>And as for the director and the rest of the cast. Bill Condon previously directed ""Gods and Monsters"" (about James Whale, the openly gay director of 1931's ""Frankenstein""), ""Kinsey"" (about Alfred Kinsey, the author of books about humans' sexual tendencies) and ""Dreamgirls"" (a fictionalized account of the Supremes). The rest of the cast includes Kevin Kline (my favorite actor), Josh Gad (Olaf in ""Frozen""), Stanley Tucci, Emma Thompson, Audra McDonald and Gugu Mbatha-Raw.<br/><br/>So, better movies will probably come out this year."

","Beauty and The Beast is an excellent movie to watch with your family because not only it stays true to the original. But it stays true to the fans of the animated version and will spawn a new generation of fans in the time being. Otherwise Beauty and The Beast lives up to its expectations and will continue to be one of the best Disney movies out there."
"tavm","10","4","13","6 April 2017"," This new version of Disney's Beauty and the Beast seemed just as excellent as the previous animated version
","For weeks, part of me dreaded watching this mostly literal Disney live-action remake of its deservedly praised and Oscar-nominated animated version from 1991. Now that I've seen it, I was mostly enthralled with what I saw. The songs are as well-performed as ever and the added ones don't make the movie too long. The CGI used to animate the inanimate objects were also pretty charming. And the actors cast for the story were very compelling to watch. I remember crying in several spots, that's how much I enjoyed it. And the Dolby screen I saw it on was also a wonderful treat for me and my movie theatre-working friend who had watched it before but not on Dolby. There were some added lines that explained some things more clearly so that was another thing I liked about this version. To tell the truth, I'd probably have to watch the other version again to make comparisons so for now I'd say I like each version equally. So that's a high recommendation of this version of Beauty and the Beast."
"patrickjames85","9","4","13","19 March 2017"," This live action retelling exceeded my expectations & gave a classic new life!
","As a fan of most Disney films & someone who grew up with the original Beauty & The Beast, I was already going in knowing that I would most likely enjoy the movie. The film did have a lot to live up too as in my opinion it's really the first live action remake of a Disney movie that already has a massive fan base, Cinderella & The Jungle Book had a bit more room to breathe. I wasn't sure about Emma Watson, the CGI or the idea of any tampering with a classic but all of that was quickly demolished as I watched the film in its glory! I really can't think of anything substantial that went wrong with this. It was carefully crafted to lay down an almost word for word, scene by scene remake while also breaking new ground & beefing up the story to make it fresh! I wasn't sure if I would like any new developments, songs, plot twists, etc.. but everything really worked & it worked well! Emma Watson & the entire cast nails their interpretations & the music is on point & amped up to give it a more dramatic flare! The imagery in the film is often breathtaking & the CGI work is crafted wonderfully! <br/><br/>I am sure there are going to be many people that will pick this film apart to within an inch of sanity, let them!! It's their miserable loss. This is a perfect movie for fans who grew up with the original & new audiences alike! It's really one of the most enjoyable times at the movie theater I've had in quite awhile! <br/><br/>GO SEE IT while it's on the big screen!! You really won't regret it! I was very impressed & so we're the group of friends I seen it with!<br/><br/>Also, for those who enjoy 3-D, I did see it in 3-D format & that is also another A+! The 3-D is beautiful & feels natural, not just a film turned into 3-D for 3-D's sake! The 3-D experience here really did take you into the world of Beauty & The Beast!"

","Please Disney.. That was the best shot you could give to a movie like this? It was really promising but nah, i was so disappointed. You could have done much more. Some lines from the original should not have been cut. I knew it would not be the same but come on! There were some smart lines and i liked the new way of Belle interacting with the Beast but i really missed the animated dance scene. the way that Belle shows to the Beast how to dance again was something else, i really missed it. Also, i didn't like the new version of Plumette. It was awful. The actors were good but nothing so special, apart from Gaston. Also HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT when Beast gains his human form again. Seriously you could have done something better with his hair. Also, when Belle leaves, the Beast is supposed to be sad not dancing and singing like he is happy. I really missed the magic of the animated movie. Lastly, as BBC wrote ""If it ain't broke, do not remake it"""

I recommend anybody planning on watching this to just go in with an open-mind.<br/><br/>Emma Watson is a gorgeous Belle, and I especially loved Josh Gad as Le Fou."

I know a lot of people don't like animated movies so it's like they translated that version like they would translate French to English, but the magic, lost nothing in the translation. <br/><br/>The magic that made that animated movie soooo good is in this version. It's an amazing feat that they were able to do that. That's how they make it work so spectacularly.<br/><br/>I will say there were some awesome performances by the live action cast members, especially Josh Gad who played LeFou. It was worth the ticket price just to see this dude make you laugh throughout the film. A stellar performance. It's The only thing that does not make this a carbon copy of the animated one. <br/><br/>Plus the the art direction was great. The sets and the costumes were fantastic. So I got to say the film works and is a rare occasion that a remake was worth doing. <br/><br/>Never as good as the first but enjoyable to watch."

","Although Beauty and The Beast was already a well-known tale, probably the people's favorite in Disney,I still find a lot more details than the old versions which completes the story and therefore make more sense.<br/><br/>In this version, Belle and the beast grow their interest not only by being a life saver, they have more communications, they do have the chance to get to know each other deeper. Also,I also like the final scene where there are more people in the ball room than the original animated version,the whole village join the celebration and therefore it is much happier than the original one.Another one is the excitement Belle shows when she was introduced to the library,it shows that she is more than a bookworm, but even more, a book lover.<br/><br/>These teeny tiny details add up and make the story fuller. And I do love this version much more,but (off course) the old one is a classic."

","This movie does the most amazing job at bringing the classic animated Disney film to life. As a huge fan of the movie growing up, I had a lot of expectations about this movie, and some worries as well, but after I saw it, the only thing I could think about was the next time I would be able to see it. It is absolute perfection, there is so much magic and thought put into this, each actor was chosen and became the character. Emma Watson makes young girls look up to a beautiful princess who has ambitions, and dreams, who wants to be more than what people want her to be. This movie shows people that love isn't just about looks, yes the original did that as well, but this makes it seem more real, it shows the progression of the characters and with some adjustments to the songs and lines, truly lets the watchers feel the emotions and understand what it is like for each character. This movie never ceases to make me uncontrollably happy, well done Disney."

","As a child, I absolutely adored the original version of this movie and was very excited to see this at the cinema when I heard that it was going to be coming out. It was my favorite growing up and because of this, I was a little nervous as to whether or not it was going to be done in the right way. I was not disappointed. <br/><br/>Emma Watson was stunning as Belle, and I can't imagine any other actress nailing the role as she did. So many memories were brought back whilst watching her at the beginning of the film with that classic blue dress she wore around the village! I was transported back into my childhood with her and thoroughly enjoyed watching her on screen. In particular, I thought that the actor that played Gaston was also excellent. <br/><br/>The story-line stays faithful to the original with a few good surprises! As a whole, it was done so beautifully, I really just cannot praise it enough. The costumes, the singing, the choice of cast, the animation of the castle's furniture - perfect. <br/><br/>If you loved the original, please ignore the negative comments/reviews you have read here and just go and see it for yourself! It is truly an amazing experience and like I said above, especially if you were a big fan as a child - you will enjoy it just as much now."
"jpachar82","10","3","9","11 July 2017"," Tale as Old as Time
","La Belle et la Bete – in English, and in our time, translates to Beauty and the Beast – started as a traditional French fairy tale, then in 1991, the imaginary mind of Walt Disney transformed the classic fairy tale into a full length animated movie and now 26 years later that old French fairy tale is now a live action film telling that old tale in a new time. From the cast of the beautiful Emma Watson (Harry Potter Series) to the gorgeously talented Audra McDonald to the ever-witty Josh Gad and then there was Gaston (Luke Evans). The characters have lived on in the hearts of believers for almost 277 years since that little French fairy tale came into existence. This new and innovative way of telling an old story in a new and inventive time has lived on over the centuries and decades. I know that, without a shadow of a doubt, that this old but classic love story will forever be in the hearts and the minds of the believers, it's not an old tale any more, it's a new way of believing in the impossible, it's about believing in the heart."
"krba-54666","9","3","9","5 May 2017"," I don't see what everyone is complaining about...
","I really did love this movie and have seen it several times! I never re-watch movies so that says a lot. For all of the people complaining, would you like some cheese with that whine? You have to keep in mind that this is a children's tale from many years ago being brought back to life for people of all ages in live action format. The transition will not be seamless. <br/><br/>I think that the music was magical and the Beast had a few funny moments. You can tell Luke Evens (Gaston) was classically trained. He has a rich, deep and fabulous singing voice and does a great job portraying the boorish,yet in-love-with-himself Gaston. Josh Gad is a good and funny sidekick. I think Emma Watson did a fine job as Belle. Physically, I don't think she looked much like the cartoon version in the face (Emily Rossum or Gal Gardot look more like the original Belle). But, she is pretty and I would give her performance a 6.5 out of 10. Her acting was a little stilted and unrealistic at times. I have no problems with her singing voice. I think she sounded fine and probably would've sounded even better if they hadn't used so many computerized effects on her voice. With the effects used, you really could not hear the underlying character of her voice. No two people have the same voice and we really didn't get to hear what hers sounded like without the effects. In certain parts it sounded as though she were talking rather than singing. But, that's my only complaint. <br/><br/>Audra McDonald was great of course and the supporting cast played their parts so well. I liked Kevin Kline's portrayal of ""crazy ol' Maurice"". And that Clothilde was funny. She had an excellent singing voice and good comedic timing. <br/><br/>I think this movie is worth watching for people of all ages. Don't take things so seriously."

"drummer0913","9","3","9","26 March 2017"," Exceptionally Executed Except...
","Literally every aspect of the original animated version with the exception of one was not only accurately replicated but expounded upon and deepened regarding character backstory and thematics in this version. <br/><br/>I loved almost every single character and every back story provided for each. Several additional songs were included which provided great depth to the whole story. From Belle to the baker and the Beast to the castle crew, everyone was greatly portrayed. Of course the visuals was astounding. <br/><br/>My only problem was LaFou. I was extremely excited to see that Josh Gad got the role because I mean who else could possibly do it better? He looks and sounds exactly like him! So yes we all know he's gay. That really wasn't my problem. What bothered me was the fact that his funny grumpy grunty loud spazzy qualities were cut just to make as many gay jokes as possible. Instead we get a weird, soft, wifey, clingy awkwardly sexual misfit tag along that has no sense of dynamic or timing. Literally the worst part of the movie was when one of the greatest songs, ""Gaston"" was coming to a close and his character prolongs the last note before the grand ending with senseless babbling about how uneducated he was by not being able to spell Gaston, delaying the music. Not one person in the theater laughed. It was honestly uncomfortable. LaFou is supposed like a snarky animaniac. Not a girly ditz. Horribly written inconsistent character. Should kept the original. <br/><br/>But other than that, SO GOOD!!!"

OK, it may not be as good as the animated Beauty and the Beast, but really, nothing is. Beauty and the Beast (1991) is Disney at its very best.

The problem I hear is it's directors and producers to blame, but that is just great manipulation since No one can add bring life to that lifeless horrible play of her I can tell.. Moreover both Luke Evans as 'Gaston' and Dan Stevens as 'the Beast' played their character well, or at least better then Emma Watson her Belle. That's to say outside of Hollywood it is Expected for characters to bring life to their to add their own originality and to try to understand their characters, but not by Harry Potter and Emma Watson fans, which in my eyes is just stupid and doublefaced.."

"pearlinasilverbasin","7","2","5","19 November 2018"," Not perfet, but it's definetely an improvement over the last one
","This movie is in a few ways an improvement over the old film; it has beautiful visuals and set designs, and has also responded to criticism over the old movie by fixing them to an extent. Where Belle seemed somewhat snobbish towards the other villagers in the first movie, here she is shown to be genuinely kind with a desire to help others but also to live her own life. Her fierce and stubborn personality with which she defies both Gaston and the Beast is a stark contrast to her somewhat meek counterpart in the old movie. Also, the movie fixed the plot holes from the old movie concerning the enchantment. However, there are some flaws, such as the blatant autotuning of Emma Watson's voice; and that they tried too hard to make the Beast look human, which instead traps him in uncanny valley limbo and makes him kind of uneasy to look at. Nevertheless, Beauty and the Beast is an enjoyable movie with well-written characters and a feast for the eye."

","I really looked forward to the release of this movie. I really thought the cast was going to make it great, but I was so disappointed.<br/><br/>This live action movie adds some backstory to the beast, which I welcomed. Then it adds backstory to Belle, which I thought was unnecessary. For the most part, the new version follows the same story as the animated one, but does so in a very slow manner. Some of the original songs, which are great, keep being lengthened or interrupted/resumed. The movie ends up being too long with serious pacing problems.<br/><br/>Add to that some low quality/creepy CGI, new songs that come out dull and out of place, poor acting (most of all from Emma Watson, who seems not to react to anything that is going on, not even when the beast whom she now loves is under attack), political correctness (reach your own conclusions here), and a weak Gaston (yes, instead of a self confident man, we see a timid sheep when around Belle). All of that makes for a poor remake."
"pwoeckener","7","2","5","9 June 2017"," Well done
","Emma Watson does better than average work as Belle, and a host of other characters make this classic come to life. If that truly is Watson's voice, she can sing fairly well; although I wouldn't expect her to release a solo album in this lifetime. Could they have done better in casting someone else for Belle? Absolutely. But I guess name recognition had something to do with this. Watson seems rigid at times, and lacks real emotion where it is needed in this film. Still, the amount of CGI, costumes, and other parts of this movie make it well worth watching. I don't get all the controversy over a gay character, because frankly, I didn't see it, and I was looking for it. But I guess some people need to make controversy when there is none. And not that it honestly matters in the grand scheme of things, but they would have been fine with not remaking the theme song that was originally sung by Peabo Bryson and Celine Dion. That's a classic version that is better off left alone. John Legend and Ariana Grande don't come close to pulling that song off the way Celine and Peabo did. But like most musical talent today - they lack their own creativity and talent, compared to what used to be considered star power."

I do not like how Emma Watson sounded like she was not classically trained with singing, which the 1991 version had an authentic Broadway sound. Disney is not wanting people who can actually belt out a note by actually working without autotuning involved, it seems. I do not like how the CGI is conducted into this messy remake. Though, I liked the CGI in the ""Be Our Guest"" song, the flashback of The Prince's childhood, and The Prince's mirror scenes. Otherwise, it made The Beast's face look expressionless from time to time. Also, I am sorry Emma. The 1991 version of Belle captured my attention before your portrayal of Belle did.

","I recently saw the beauty and the beast by Bill Condon. It's a musical, romantic and fantasy film which produced by Walt Disney Pictures in 2017 and lasted 129 minutes. This movie is set in U.S.A, it tells the story of Belle played by Emma Watson . The story begins an enchantress witch transforms the prince into a monster and the servants into household objects and to break the spell , the price must learn to love and earn the love in return before the rose's last petal falls .

","If you've seen the 1991 animated classic, that experience will almost certainly cloud your initial viewing of this live action version. The first time I saw the new Beauty and the Beast (Thursday night), I thought it was good to very good. When I saw it again this morning (Sunday), it was spectacular. I was able to free myself from inevitable comparisons and could just enjoy this movie on its own. And it really is special. The back stories on Maurice, Belle and the Beast added to the richness of the story and fleshed out their characters in a very meaningful way. The new songs also added depth. Emma Watson's singing voice was better than I expected although not a strong, Broadway show capability. Dan Stevens, on the other hand, has a surprisingly strong, deep voice. Luke Evans is quite a performer and singer who does a great job portraying Gaston even without being the size of a barge. The voice actors did a superb job as well. Josh Gad was very good, and for some will be an acquired taste. Treat yourself to a second viewing; you will not regret it."

","I originally had very low expectations for this movie. Unlike a lot of other people, I actually really enjoyed the song previews by Emma Watson. But the visuals didn't seem close enough to the original. However, seeing the movie today I was proved wrong. There were a few visual aspects that I questioned, such as Mrs. Potts and Chip, but thinking about it, it would actually be incredibly hard to convert the original animated movie into a live action movie. The film was incredibly well executed considering how well-loved the original is. I was speechless around halfway through the movie. I could sympathize with the Beast incredibly well. The audience was given more of the Beast's history which made the character development and relatability so much more effective. In regards to Mrs. Potts and Chip, I thought the character animation was really awkward and the design was subpar compared to the other characters. Plumette (Lumière's love interest), was also incredibly odd. The way that she could fly maybe made sense in order for her to move, but she looked more alive than the others considering the fact she was based off of a bird. I originally believed that the Beast's appearance looked far too kind to be considered frightening, or beastly. But as the film progressed I noticed the emotion in the eyes especially that makes the Beast more human and therefore more relatable. The music was delightful, very emotional and included original songs as well as the music from the 1991 movie. In addition, a lot of the mistakes made in the 1991 version were fixed. I noticed that the actions of the characters were a lot more believable and realistic. A lot of the content in the original movie was slightly unrealistic, and so the change was refreshing, especially since it made it different from the other film and not an exact copy. Overall, the movie was incredible and definitely worth seeing in theaters."

","Beauty and the Beast was a wonderful movie to watch with my kids and husband! The visual effects were stunning, and the original songs a delight to my ears! I admire the scriptwriters' creativity in cleaning up the plot holes and adding dimension to Le Fou.

","Even amidst concerns of political agendas and apprehensions about Emma Watson's Belle, the magic of Disney's Beauty and the Beast prevails in this truly enchanting fairy tale of fairy tales.<br/><br/>Were there bits and pieces that didn't quite feel right? Of course there were. The animated feature film on which this is based has been my most favorite animated film since its release in 1991. But, overall, the essence remained, and the storybook experience was even enhanced with lustrous visuals and the addition of three beautiful songs that I can't wait to download. ""Days in the Sun"" = so lovely :)<br/><br/>As for Belle, I was a little disappointed with how she opened the film in what had become the best musical opener of any animated film to date. The Belle we instantly loved in the original Disney version was vibrant and, although peculiar, she was comfortable in her own skin, despite the whispers and stares in town. Emma Watson's version seemed gloomy and overly self-conscious. But as the film progressed, I grew to appreciate this Belle, and, yes, I embraced her in the story.<br/><br/>One last thing... be ready for it: the Be Our Guest number is so spectacular, you might wonder why you're the only one in the theater applauding in a standing ovation at the end of it.

"cruise01","8","4","14","17 March 2017"," Beautifully done for a live action remake.
","A beloved classic Disney film being remade into a live action does live up to the original movie with the lovable characters, same musical sequences, and some beautiful visual effects. Disney's has been doing so well into remaking their classics into live action like the previous films like The Jungle Book, Pete's Dragon, Cinderella, etc. Bill Condon direction follows the classic in every way that fans would love. The rest comes down to criticizing the cast talent meeting the characters expectations, the visual effects on Beasts and the characters like Lumiere, Cogsworth, etc. <br/><br/>I really liked the live action follow up and loved how every moment being reenacted. Also, feel like they explore more in depth with the Beast and Belle's past about losing there loved ones. The plot is amazing and beautiful being the same exact thing about the original. The Prince (Dan Stevens) and his staff are cursed in the castle after his actions of rejecting a beggar woman who crashes his party. She curses the Prince turning him into a beast and his castle staff into furniture. Then, it follows Belle (Emma Watson) who feels like an outcast in her village for being obsessed with reading. And captures the attention of a narcissistic Gaston (Luke Evans) who is determined to marry her. When Belle's father goes missing in a snowy dark castle. She learns that her father has been imprisoned by the beast and takes her fathers place. The castle bouteiller Lumiere (Ewan McGregor) that is cursed into a candelabra and Cogsworth (Ian McKellen) who is a clock tries to convince the Beast to try to charm Belle and maybe she can be the one to fall in love with him, in order to break the curse. <br/><br/>The film does have beautiful musical sequences. Emma Watson as Belle was a perfect choice, being a beautiful talented actress and portraying the character really well. Hard to imagine any one else doing the role. Dan Stevens was also great, with a performance that was delivering a menacing voice as the beast at first, and a prince. Luke Evans and Josh Gad were matched up well as Gaston and Lefou. <br/><br/>Turning the animated characters in the original to a live action version worked for the most part. I still fell in love with the animated Cogsworth and Lumiere and found them to be funny and entertaining. In the live action, the two being brought to a visually realistic candelabra and antique clock was stunning but had less quirky humor and cute characteristics the original had. Not sure if it was the voice cast Ewan McGregor or Ian McKellen which they are very talented actors. Or the way the characters were written. <br/><br/>The ball dance sequence was stunning and had that magical beautiful visuals look. The film does have plenty of gorgeous sets, visual effects, musical sequences, and a great cast ensemble.<br/><br/>Overall, Beauty and the Beast is a good fantasy film that lives up to the original and fans will love. I will give the film 4 out of 5 stars."
"TheMovonka","8","4","14","17 March 2017"," Disney, the professional
","Well, let's be honest. The beauty and the beast, a tale as old as time, even as most of us know it since 1991, is a story that maybe never needed a remake, never needed any improvement from the iconic original Disney movie and especially will split viewers in haters and lovers. Here is why.<br/><br/>Emma Watson, a heroine for the whole Harry Potter generation with acting skills one could discuss but a charm and beauty you cannot ignore, embodies the new Belle in a way the story fits to our society. Luke Evans sticks out with perfect role fit, awesome skills and IS and will always be the real life Gaston. Dan Stevens as a CGI overloaded beast, Josh Gad as funny, gay and sympathetic companion on the bad side, and many stars more to fill the flick with life, music and fun. They all are a cast which let you agree, yes, if it was real, that's how the people were!<br/><br/>But, and there is the split, what never is emphasized that much in a comic movie, is how fake and kitschy most of the backgrounds, costumes, dialogues and if you want the musical scenes are looking. Critiques are already summarizing missing singing skills of some cast members, the bad CGI and the fake atmosphere and I agree, still I absolutely loved this movie. You cannot expect a copy of the comic movie with talking closets, candlesticks or watches, a horse that finds the way and obviously stupid villagers doing illogical stuff all the day without looking fake. What was easier in Jungle Book, were the only week spot was the human, is not comparable with the more musical oriented script of Beauty and the Beast. Yes maybe the wolves and the beast could have been better, but if you are ready to jump into the musical entertainment show with all your kids heart from the 90ies, you are going to feel with all characters and situations the way Disney want you to and smile at the screen with every melody you could sing along immediately. If you were never one of these guys, then Disney could have done whatever you want and you would not have been satisfied. <br/><br/>To summarize, chapeau for Luke Evans, thank you dear filmmakers for showing character and sticking to small gay gags and erasing a lot of illogical things out of the comic movie to make it ""more"" realistic and consistent, congratulations for Emma Watson enchanting the next generation of kids with a beloved story and melodies and I pay all my respects to the so often criticized Disney company for just knowing what they do for fans. Besides company policy or whatever I am not the one to judge, in filmmaking they are professionals, period."
"Alexander_Blanchett","8","5","20","17 March 2017"," Great rebirth of childhood memories
","I was sceptical about this Project, especially because it is based on one of the animated classics that defined my childhood. I was scared they wouldn't capture the soul and Magic of it. It turns out they did. At least most of it. I was really positivly surprised that it was done so well. Many criticize it for being a 1:1 Remake of the original but to be honest, that is exactly what I wanted it to be. I didn't want them to Change things, reinterpret things, because we have seen that before in other Versions of ""Beauty and the Beast"" and it never worked. No they kept it the same, Frame by Frame just live Action which was the right Thing to do. They added some more Scenes to give the characters more depths which was a nice addition as it all fits the characters. Some of the new Songs were great too. (the Beast finally sings!) Acting wise it was nothing to write home about but not bad either. Not too sure about Emma Watson as Belle, although she was fine, she never really entered the character as much as I wanted her too, it was often a little shallow. Dan Stevens as the Beast was great, captured most of the needed elements of the role. The strength of the cast lies in the voice work (and live Action work too) of the supporting Players, mostly Ewan McGregor and especially Emma Thompson. I also loved Ian McKellen and Stanley Tucci had his moments, too. Luke Evans was okay, but I hoped he would be more self ironic. Kevin Kline held himself well, but can do even better. Inspired casting choice however. I cannout complain much about Bill Condon's direction which was well enough especially during the Musical numbers. Great choreography. Costumes and Production desigsn should get some notes next Oscar seaosn. All in all a beautiful Ferry tale that totally worked for me."
"Muhammad_Nd","10","4","15","17 May 2017"," Musical Magic
","For starters, one can never go in, expecting the level of perfection the original had. In 1991 we were given heaven in the shape of some of the most magical lyrics written​ anywhere. The animation wasn't spectacular, but the film was special and had plenty of soul. It was a great picture. The newest entry has new songs, which are decent but nowhere near as spectacular as the original score. However, the new entry does really well in most instances.<br/><br/>The new cast shines providing much of the reality and magic to the living furniture. They, after all, are human. Emma Thompson is strong and sweet. The rest of the cast does a decent job. And there is Belle who in spite of not being a professional singer manages to handle the songs nicely. No superb singing, but she's not a singer, she's alternate misfit. Unlike recent musicals, this is one is touching and fill of memorable and deep interpretations. There's plenty to him along even in the new songs.<br/><br/>I like what they added to the story. Tiny bits that give you some insight about many of the main characters. The prince is not just a beast, but a product of his upbringing. Belle is more complicated and with much going on in her heart and mind.<br/><br/>The musical adaptation is fantastic. The village opening number will leave breathless and the people behind the art direction, sets, and costumes deserve the highest praise. Gowns look glorious and the sets made me believe we were in the middle of an opulent setting. Great job.<br/><br/>Simply, adaptation great films is problematic from the start, yet no misfires here. Condon tops his precious musical entries and manages to keep that soul intact, making us believe in an intelligent romance."

The combination of the score, the emotions and the characters we love so dearly made this movie beautiful. Tonight, I saw the movie for my fourth time and I saw the sing along version and sang along to EVERY song and was captivated in the movie all over again.

"rockman182","8","3","10","19 March 2017"," Beauty and the Beast (2017)
","Ever since I heard about the news about a live action adaptation of this Disney classic I was over the moon. I was even more excited to hear Emma Watson was going to play Belle. I'm a big fan of her and will watch any of her work. There was still a bit of cautiousness about this adaptation. The animated musical is my favorite Disney film of all time and it was completely possible to be disappointed because of it not holding up to the 1991 version. Now having seen it I must say this film was great. If you are a fan of the animated film I think you wont be let down by this very faithful re-imagining.<br/><br/>I'll start with the negatives if they can even be called that. I think the CGI Beast looked odd and off at times, especially around the face. Dan Stevens is completely unrecognizable but still some of the Beast scenes have a slight hindrance of looking computerized. Some of the same could be said with the facial expressions on Mrs. Potts and Chip. This qualm is really minimal though, it must be hard bringing a talking beast and talking teacup to life so this is barely a criticism. The film is quite long, the animated classic is basically spread out with even more songs and scenes between Belle and The Beast. Its not really bad as it doesn't really take away from the fantastical experience. The Beauty and the Beast main theme was kind of disappointing. Emma Thompson did a nice job but the song doesn't compare to the Angela Lansbury version which is supreme. Lastly, the castle design should have followed the animated version more closely, in my opinion.<br/><br/>The production and set design is fabulous. I'm sure a lot of the scenes were computerized however it all looks great. The scene of Belle singing up on to the hills early on in the film looks magnificent. The castle and costume design is on point. The costumes especially bring the animated characters to life. There is so much going on on screen and your eyes are captivated by it all. I'm talking especially about the ""Be Our Guest"" song, its absolutely spectacular. The music is also great and for the most part faithfully re-recorded and completely respects the songs in the Disney classic.<br/><br/>People were complaining about Emma Watson portraying Belle. I think she may put a lot of the critics to rest now. She handles the Belle character with grace, beauty, and a strong willing persuasion. Every scene I felt like the animated Belle came to life. Dan Stevens and Ewan McGregor voice (and motion capture I guess) were great. Luke Evans was an MVP as the brash, cocky, and downright jerky Gaston. The cast all did a great job of bringing their counterparts to life. I was hesitant about Bill Condon helming the film but now am glad that he did.<br/><br/>This was a very faithful live update to the animated film from 1991. There are more songs and space for characters to grow and cinematography to pop but its all very respectful to its predecessor. Overall, if you are a die-hard fan of the animated version I think you will love it. Its a wonderful new addition (and perhaps the strongest one yet) to the live action Disney remake trend. Its a bright and profitable future if these first crop of films are any indication of whats to come.<br/><br/>8.5/10"
"themadmovieman","7","3","10","17 March 2017"," A beautifully traditional fairytale, and a triumphant return to the Disney of old
","This is such a nice film. Taking Disney back to their roots of what makes a good fairytale blockbuster, it's a fantastically vibrant, entertaining and traditional movie that'll have you smiling from start to finish. It's very similar to the original film, but as far as remakes go, Disney have done a fantastic job again, making Beauty And The Beast an absolutely wonderful watch.<br/><br/>I know that there's so much adoration for the 1991 animation, but I've never been its biggest fan. As nice as it is, it didn't always have that same Disney magic that I really love, so I wasn't going into this with my nostalgia goggles on, nor with any particularly high expectations.<br/><br/>That said, I had a great time with this movie. Above all, its traditional feel makes it a properly enchanting watch, bringing back the classic Disney magic of the 1950s and 90s that we haven't really seen anywhere on the big screen since.<br/><br/>Unlike 2016's The Jungle Book and 2014's Maleficent, Beauty And The Beast doesn't hold back when mirroring its predecessor, but it doesn't make one bit of difference, simply because it's such a pleasant and magical film.<br/><br/>On the one hand, fans of the original will get a wonderful burst of nostalgia with the return of classic characters and musical numbers, but also, the classic vibes of the film will make you remember why you love all those old Disney movies. You may think that the fairytale formula has been beaten into the ground, but watching this film, with its hugely traditional feel, felt very refreshing.<br/><br/>There's nothing about this film that tries to be clever and different to what we know can make such an enjoyable watch. With no dark revisionism, no switching of roles, and no hesitation to burst into song whenever it feels like it, Beauty And The Beast feels like the Disney movie of old that's been missing for so many years, and that pleasant, colourful and fun-loving classic vibe is exactly what makes it such a wonderful watch that will easily have you smiling ear to ear by the end.<br/><br/>Along with the excellent direction and writing that allow for the film to be such a triumphant return to the classic Disney way, the performances here are excellent, with a delightful turn from Emma Watson as Belle, a whole host of hilarious A-listers as the furniture at the Beast's castle, Josh Gad's funniest role since Frozen as Le Fou, and a fantastically villainous performance from Luke Evans as the dashingly evil Gaston.<br/><br/>And on top of those performances are some stunning visuals. Although the CGI of the Beast isn't quite on the level of The Jungle Book, the castle exterior is amazingly created, whilst the real-life production design places you as firmly in a magical version of rural France as the animated film, and the exquisite costume design adds even more to the enchanting feel of it all.<br/><br/>I have to say that I was really surprised by how much I enjoyed this film, particularly given how close it is to the original, but that doesn't mean it's completely problem-free. For one, as good as a lot of the musical numbers are, they do occasionally feel a little out of the blue. It's not a huge issue, but the way that the songs are brought into scenes is a little off from time to time, not to mention the fact that the film's second half is a lot more jam- packed with music than the first.<br/><br/>Another issue with the music comes in the form of some unfortunate meddling with Emma Watson's voice. She may not be the greatest singer in the world, but what's most disappointing is that her singing sequences are heavily autotuned, and it's very distracting, particularly in comparison to either hiring another singer or just letting her sing naturally.<br/><br/>Finally, the Beast is a little bit of a disappointment. For me, the animation managed to capture the character's inner turmoil a lot better, and as such make his transformation through the film even stronger. Whilst it's not bad here, and Dan Stevens' performance is fine, I felt that the CGI Beast wasn't quite the emotional presence that I wanted him to be.<br/><br/>Overall, however, I had a wonderful time with Beauty And The Beast. A surprising improvement on the original in my book, but most of all a beautiful return to the classic Disney style, with a pleasant, vibrant, and wonderfully traditional vibe from start to finish."
"drewmeister11","7","3","10","17 March 2017"," Good, but ultimately pointless
","First off, I'm not really sure why this movie had to be made. Watching the trailers I suspected that it was by and large a shot- for-shot remake, and... yeah, it pretty much was.<br/><br/>The Beast himself is far more expressive here. The CG is really good, he comes across the most different of the characters (except Gaston's sidekick, who's now apparently dealing with the fact he's in love with Gaston, but it's all very minor stuff). He seems more human, and while it's surprisingly easier for me to relate to him in this version, I worry that it might be at the expense of the story's message. The original beast looked like a wild animal, covered completely in hair, almost always hunched over. Here he's often standing straight, and because he doesn't have much hair covering his face he seems more human. I liked the idea that you have to judge him based on his actions and words rather than his looks, so I feel he should looks less human.<br/><br/>Emma Watson was a pretty good Bell here, too. She didn't really get anything new to do that the original didn't, but she works extremely well with what she's given. Oh, and she can also sing, apparently. It's kind of funny that it never occurred to me until I sat down in the theater that I had no idea if she COULD sing, but once the first song began I was no longer worried. <br/><br/>The curse is more fleshed out here, which is nice. We learn that the servants will turn into ordinary appliances if the curse isn't broken, losing all sentience. Compared to the original where they didn't seem particularly unhappy with their lives, this gives it more weight. We also learn that everybody outside the castle was made to forget they all even existed, and see that the path to the castle was blocked by a (possibly magical) tree.<br/><br/>There was a subplot with the enchantress who cursed them all to begin with returning at the end of it all, which I sort of liked. I always found myself considering her to be the real villain of the original film as she essentially cursed a little boy for not letting a total stranger stay in his magnificent palace for a night, so seeing that she made sure to show up at the end of the allotted time to see how things played out made sense. That said, it turns out she apparently spent the last 10 or 20 years just sorta hanging out in the local village, which if I'm being honest is really, really dumb.<br/><br/>There was also another subplot that literally went nowhere in which Bell laments never having known her mother. They try to link this to the Beast also never knowing his mother and how their fathers treated them very differently. I was honestly worried they were going to combine these two different subplots and shout out 'SURPRISE! Bell's mother was the enchantress ALL ALONG!' but fortunately they didn't do that. It's like finding the original had half an hour of deleted scenes that someone just decided to edit into the movie.<br/><br/>It is really hard to talk about the characters with this movie because this whole thing is so close to the original in it's script, music, and appearance that I find myself associating some character behaviors and motives with their original cartoon version. In the original movie Gaston was one of my favorite Disney villains, and while he's still fun here, he seems less villainous. The original Gaston was an egocentric dumb-dumb. He never really made any villainous acts until partway through the movie when he deliberately schemed to have Bell's father locked away in an insane asylum unless she agrees to marry him. It's a calculated move to get what he wants, and he has plenty of time to turn away but chooses not to. Here he just seems to react in the moment; when he's told by Bell's father that he can't marry her, he punches the man out in anger and leaves him in the woods. When he's confronted about this by some angry townspeople, he decides to have him committed to cover up his act. When Bell shows up and reveals that there IS a Beast and her father is NOT crazy, Gaston then insists that she's only saying this because the Beast placed a curse on her to say these things, and they have to all raid the castle to stop him from cursing them, too. Again, it's all reactive. It wasn't pre-meditated, which makes him less menacing and more...well, kinda wimpy, actually. <br/><br/>Also, Gaston goes out like a bitch. O.G Gaston fell to his death because he cowardly attacked the Beast's back and was thrown from the castle. It's his own cowardice, dishonorable tactics, and unwillingness to relent that leads him to get himself killed. Here he shoots at the beast, and the bridge he's on just sorta... breaks. <br/><br/>I know I mostly talk about the bad things here, but that's the whole problem. There is a LOT to like about this movie, but unfortunately it's all the stuff we've seen before. The new and/or changed stuff is mostly forgettable or mismanaged, but it's largely overshadowed by the stuff we know and love from the original. The music is still memorable, the characters still lovable, and the story is still one of the greats. If you liked the first one and don't mind the fact that it's trying it's damned hardest to be as close to the first as possible, then you'll like this one, too. If you don't particularly care to watch the same movie all over again, though, then just save your money."

","I knew as soon as I saw the trailer that this would not be very good compared to the wonderful 1991 animation. And I was proved right. It just falls flat, thanks largely to Emma Watson's lifeless performance as Belle. She shows no better acting skills than she had in the HP series; ie she is just playing Hermione throughout but with less soul. And her singing....soooo autotuned. No No No. Someone a lot better could have breathed new life into Belle, but EW isn't it. The only part of the film where I even cracked a smile was during the Gaston number; that was fab, as they can all actually sing!!"
"Marx_Bros_Fan86","6","3","11","18 March 2017"," Entertaining enough, but lacking
","Beauty and the Beast is Disney's latest live action remake of one of their animated classics. But unlike Jungle Book, Maleficent, and from what I've heard, Cinderella, which gave us new spins on familiar stories, Disney opted to make this movie a scene by scene remake of the original. With excellent production values and a high caliber cast that includes Dan Stevens, Ian McKellen, Emma Thompson, and Ewan McGregor, Disney certainly delivered an entertaining family film, but it is too similar to the animated movie to really stand out in any way. <br/><br/>The story is unchanged - a mean, selfish prince is cursed by an Enchantress and transformed into a beast until he can learn to love - and someone loves him back. All hope seems lost until a beautiful, intelligent woman named Bell finds his castle in search of her father, who the beast has imprisoned. You can guess what happens next if you don't know.<br/><br/>This Beauty and the Beast is about thirty minutes longer than the original. The extra scenes do provide some interesting background information and resolve some plot holes from the original movie, which is appreciated. But other subplots just fall flat. A subplot about Belle's mother and LaFou (Gaston's buddy) don't really go anywhere. There are also four new songs here and I can't say I can remember a single one of them.<br/><br/>The cast is mostly excellent. Luke Evans is a funny Gaston and Kevin Kline is good as Bell's father. Dan Stevens also gives the Beast emotional depth. Unfortunately the weakest link in the cast is the most important part - Belle. I don't understand how Emma Watson continues to find work - she's a complete bore as an actress and the auto tune for her singing is really obvious. She's good enough, but her love scenes with the Beast aren't convincing. They feel like they are going through the motions. <br/><br/>Even the special effects are a mixed bag. The Beast's facial expressions and movements are not as convincing as they should be. While the living household objects are animated well, they are almost too realistic, which robs them of the character they had in the animated movie. <br/><br/>This Beauty and the Beast is a good film to take your kids to, but it ultimately represents the worst trends in Hollywood nowadays. It's afraid of taking risks and it exploits nostalgia for cash. I can understand why they didn't want to change too much of the original, given that it's arguably their best animated film, but that just begs the question - did this need to be made? I think the answer is no."
"rannynm","9","3","11","17 March 2017"," A Whimsical Yet Captivating Take on the Disney Classic
","Beauty and the Beast, directed by Bill Condon is a whimsical yet captivating film that I highly adored watching. This live action film has made my ""Top 10 List"" due to its incredible singing performances, marvelous set designs and accuracy of the original Disney story. As a Disney fanatic myself, I absolutely love that this film has the power to take me back to my younger days. <br/><br/>Daughter of a wise and humble merchant (Kevin Kline), Belle (Emma Watson) is a bright and independent young lady who will be taken as a prisoner by a monstrous beast (Dan Stevens) in place of her elderly, caring father. As prisoner of the Beast in his cold dark castle, Belle soon builds a strong bond with the talking enchanted objects of the castle. Who will help break the lasting ""forever curse"" by bringing the Beast and Belle closer? Belle learns to look past the frightening physical appearance of the Beast and looks upon his caring gentle soul. But, will this be enough to break the lasting forever curse upon the castle and the Beast?<br/><br/>Incorporated as a live action film from Disney's original animated film, Beauty and the Beast, the whole cast delivers exquisite performances portraying each unique and iconic character. The caring, yet brave Belle is played by the talented actress Emma Watson. Watson has appeared in numerous films including the Harry Potter films, My Week with Marilyn and The Perks of Being a Wallflower. Dan Stevens, known from Legion TV Series deftly portrays the terrifying Beast, a difficult character to play due to its temper. <br/><br/>From the songs, to the set designs, this film has it all. I truly appreciate and love that they took the 1991 Disney classic and turned it into a live action film. This is something that has not been seen before and was well directed by Bill Condon (Mr. Holmes, The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 1 and 2, Dreamgirls). Being a huge Disney princess fan, I am highly pleased with the accuracy of this live action version. The costumes, songs, characters and plot are all very accurate. It made me feel as if I was in a Disney story book. <br/><br/>One of favorite things about this film and the story of Beauty and the Beast itself, is the message it depicts – that of looking past the physical and looking within. This is a moral that every viewer can learn from. The film is very successful in massaging this message and the audience will easily relate to the moral as the film unfolds before their eyes.<br/><br/>This enchanted, unbelievable film deserves 5 out of 5. I highly recommend it to families, young children and Disney fanatics. Kids and adults both will enjoy watching it and singing along with the iconic songs. <br/><br/>Reviewed by Maria G., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic."
"powermandan","8","3","11","17 March 2017"," Did You Really Expect It To Be As Good As 1991's Version?
","1991's adaptation of Beauty & the Beast is my favourite animated film. I honestly do think it is the best ever. No disrespect to Toy Story or Snow White, but the 1991 classic has such beauty and raw power that has an undeniably strong emotional impact. Sure there have been other adaptations of Beauty and the Beast, but none of which was a remake of the cartoon. When I found out that a live-action version of the cartoon would be made, I was thrilled. My favourite animated film ever is being made with real people! The Jungle Book and Cinderella are the recent live-action versions of Disney classic and they soared high. Okay maybe I'm babbling, so I'll get to the point: 2017's live- action version of the beloved Beauty and the Beast is good but not great.<br/><br/>Emma Watson dons the role of Belle. She was good, but not great. In fact, she may be the worst cast in this. Dan Stevens is almost perfect as Beast. For the costume he gets, there was no getting better. Luke Evans is pretty awesome as Gaston (I think that's how it's spelled). Josh Gad was great as his sidekick. And Kevin Kline was wonderful as Belle's father, Maurice. But how well do these character's mesh with everything else?<br/><br/>In the first little bit, Belle is popular and Gaston wants to marry her. The movie takes off when Maurice stumbles into the Beast's castle. Honestly, the whole chunk before that isn't all that special. The beautiful scenery and looks are what carry it...and the whole movie. This first bit didn't seem to have the joy and spirit that the 90's version had. It's rather bland. It doesn't suck, it just doesn't have much of a reaction on the viewer.<br/><br/>When Maurice winds up at Beast's castle, he becomes his prisoner. Belle rescues him and she takes his place. Now the movie is taking off and we're at the point where the cool things happen. All of the animatronics of the accessories were sweet and the castle itself looks wonderful. And of course, everybody's a sucker for the romance between Belle and Beast. The only flaws were that the magic was lost. The little furniture things were cool but not awesome, the scenery wasn't enchanting or glamorous, and it was all too dark. I was expecting the look to be as enchanting as the live-action version of Cinderella from 2015. This one got lucky a few times, such as (obviously) the ""Tale As Old As Time"" scene. In terms of looks, that Cinderella wins.<br/><br/>The other stuff that deals with Gaston is rather generic. When him and the town's people invade the castle, it is the battle between him and Beast that is actually the worst part of that scene. There was nothing special or intense about it like the cartoon had. With all this upgraded technology, they should have made it as awesome as the cartoon! But whatever, the payoff when Beast and all the objects turn back into humans is wonderful.<br/><br/>So the movie doesn't have the magic or charm that the 1991 cartoon had. So the pacing was off (almost fifty minutes were added, a simple fifteen or twenty would have been enough). So it was dark. The movie still has stuff going for it. The imagery is beautiful, the romance is strong, the music is fine, etc. Maybe they're not at the level of the old one, but this still does almost all those well enough. And the flaws I listed are reasons this movie wasn't totally fantastic and why I may not call it one of the year's best.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, I recommend it. It's hard not to compare, but this is too good to ignore.<br/><br/>3/4"
"AdultAudienceMember","6","3","11","17 March 2017"," High school play with CGI thrown in.
","Spoiler Alert!!!!!!!!! They live happily ever after.<br/><br/>Pros: The female lead is girl-next-door pretty. The CGI is at times fantastic even though The Beast looks photo-shopped at times. The songs you love are there. The number in the tavern is pretty darn good. The numbers involving the talking non-human objects are very entertaining.The theater was full of hot suburban moms...you know the term. Small children will like it though I think there are times when it will be too violent for anyone under the age of 10.<br/><br/>Cons: The first musical number in the village just doesn't work. Everyone comes across as trying too hard. The songs you hate are there. This isn't nearly as good as Jungle Book....not even close. The movie is way too long. The obvious man-crush that the lead bad guy's personal assistant has is just way too obvious and intentionally so. It become a central plot device. I know, it is a PC/economic decision. Disney wants to draw in as many bodies as possible. Inclusiveness sells.<br/><br/>I left disappointed but my wife enjoyed it. Small children cheered. Their mothers wanted to get home to start drinking. Dad's peace and quite was coming to an end."

"frank-brennan-1","9","2","6","22 June 2017"," Ignore the negative reviews. Brilliant remake with 3 additional brilliant songs and more Belle and beast backstory that adds greater emotional impact.
","I can't believe that anyone who loved the original would not love this. Evermore, Days in the Sun and How Does a Moment Last Forever are 3 new and fantastic emotionally- charged songs that take the original to a new level. Overall it is a better musical for these songs. The Beast is better represented as the protagonist and his aria ""Everymore"" could very well win the Best Original Song Oscar. He has more of a backstory that explains his previous selfish behaviour. Belle too has a backstory that adds depth to her and her father's characters. Emma Watson cannot reach the vocal heights of Paige O'Hara in the original but she has a sweet voice and shines as Belle as does Dan Stevens as The Beast (and his version of Evermore is better than Josh Grobans in the closing credits). In fact the whole ensemble cast is perfectly cast. Not surprised it has taken 1.2 billion at the box office and is the 2nd highest grossing musical of all time. Sure to watch it many more times in the future as I do other great musicals."

","Once again, I see people getting so personal with a mere film. The animated ""Beauty and the Beast"" is in my top ten Disney movies. It has charm and color and some really great singing. It is a tremendous story, based on an unforgettable fairy tale. So, as is the case with other films, there was a Broadway version made and it has become as successful as just about any other musical. All that said, I'm astonished by all the people giving this film a rating of ""one."" It has incredible special effects, great costuming, glorious sound. Most of the characters seem to work just fine. I would have cast someone besides Emma Watson as Belle, but she holds her own. There are times when the pacing drags a bit, but it stays on serve much of the time. I liked Kevin Kline as Maurice. He is always solid in his roles. I did find the conclusion quite disappointing. It didn't have that cathartic effect it should have. But it's far from a terrible movie."

","This live action version of Beauty and the Beast was amazing. As one of my childhood favourite films I was worried when Disney announced they were going to remake it, but I had nothing to be worried about. Emma Watson portrayed Belle beautifully, and her singing was even better than the original. This film brought a new lease of life to this classic tale since watching it I can't stop singing the songs!"
"AppleEye2U","7","2","6","16 April 2017"," Traditional Hollywood musical with modern techniques
","If you haven't seen this Beauty & The Beast adaption yet, please go and watch this movie without prejudice. Don't expect a 'real life action' version of the Disney animation movie from 1991. Better compare this to a musical movie in the best Hollywood tradition, bedazzled with state of the art computer graphics, it's a treat.<br/><br/>The Good: If you like musicals with luxurious sets, vivid colors, you'll love this movie. Also it's a parade of well known actors, and their voices. Some scenes are reminiscent of other musical movies like The Sound of Music (Belle on top of the mountain) or Oliver Twist (Gaston's beer-drinking song) The woods and cloudy skies seem to derive straight from Lord of The Rings. I felt myself getting into this 3 D story book, enjoying every minute of it, although I'm quiet familiar with the fairy tale.<br/><br/>The Bad: IMO this Disney production is too much a remake of its own animated movie, using the same colors and styles for the actors' wigs and costumes. Then, naturally, people start complaining about actors who are not 'the real Belle' or 'Gaston' or whomever they play. If the makers would consider this a classic Broadway musical, they would allow their actors to use the stage like in Phantom of the Opera or Moulin Rouge. Now some scenes were copy paged from the nineties version, like the living mops cleaning the castle or the flying dinnerware creating all kind of abstract motions and patterns. They could have known those creations are always better made in animation.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed this adaption very much: the story lines were solid like the all star cast, some were better singers than others, with notable roles from Luke Evans, Josh Gad and Kevin Kline. The scenery and music score were perfectly arranged, the emotions right on spot. Highly recommended for musical lovers!"
"studioAT","7","2","6","12 April 2017"," Very good
","So beloved was the animated version of 'Beauty and the Beast' back in 1991 that this film was always going to attract perhaps more scrutiny than the other films that Disney have taken from animated to live action form.<br/><br/>I thought a lot of this film worked very well. Everyone is well cast and all the classic moments from the animated film are brought to life with a lot of class and attention to detail.<br/><br/>Yes, there are deviations from the original, with whole new songs and subplots inserted, which people will either love or hate, but if anything these enhance the experience rather than detract. I don't know what all the fuss was about Josh Gad's character being gay, it's been blown out of proportion.<br/><br/>This was an enjoyable new take on a classic film."
"ChristianLeFeuvre","7","2","6","2 April 2017"," Not a bad adaptation
","It has to be said, Disney's live action adaptations of their classic animations haven't really worked, 'The Jungle Book' was horrendous and the less said about the diabolical reworking of 'Pete's Dragon' the better. However, they've finally managed to redeem themselves with the newly released 'Beauty And The Beast'. Apart from a few niggles, I thought it was very good. It is easily the closest adaptation, and is extremely faithful to the award winning 1991 animated film. Emma Watson was magnificent as Belle and her singing voice was wonderful (I understand she actually had some singing lessons from the original Belle, Paige O'Hara). It is difficult to comment on Dan Stevens portrayal of the Beast as so much was CGI, but he was suitably well cast as the handsome Prince when he was visible on screen. Lumiere the candelabra and Cogsworth the clock were voiced by Ewan McGregor and Sir Ian McKellen respectively, and as much as I loved Ewan's singing in 'Moulin Rouge', he was hindered in this role by the awful French accent he had to put on, which I found wavered on and off occasionally. The teapot Mrs Potts, so perfectly voiced by Angela Lansbury in the original, was portrayed by Emma Thompson, who I thought sounded like she was trying to impersonate Angela instead of putting her own touch to the character. Luke Evans stars as Gaston and in the classic animation, Gaston was just a self-obsessed, arrogant, simple minded villain, who's determination to be looked on as ""the best"" and marry Belle, drives him to fight the Beast out of jealousy, and was actually depicted as a comedic character, but in this movie he is far darker and, although retaining his narcissistic and self-centred traits, he is much nastier and the comedic stupidity and arrogance from the original is replaced with a far more manipulative and violent persona. The fight between Gaston and the Beast differs too, from a simple battle of strength and wits culminating in Gaston stabbing the Beast before falling to his death in the animated movie, to Gaston actually shooting the Beast a few times before eventually falling to his death. Now, those who know me know, I don't like change for change sake and was very disappointed at a number of other changes too. The musical numbers, added lyrics to the original numbers, added scenes (especially the scene explaining the reason Belle's mother isn't there, which was pretty pointless as far as I could tell). All the classic well known songs from the original are here, but as I mentioned there are added lyrics to some, and the lyrics in the song 'Gaston' were, at times, almost inaudible. I do understand that sometimes songs are added for timing reasons, but there is a stunning and award winning stage production of 'Beauty and The Beast' which has added songs in it, so I couldn't understand why they had to write brand new songs for this movie rather than just add a couple from the stage production, especially the Beast's number 'If I Can't Love Her', which, in my opinion, would have fitted better than the number he sings in this movie 'Evermore'. Despite the few disappointments, I do have to say that it is a stunning movie, very well made with some excellent performances and doesn't stray too far from the Oscar winning original we all know and love. Worth seeing for sure."

","Reading all the negative reviews citing the 'distracting' CGI, Emma Watson not being as good as the animated Belle(!), etc., etc. I wonder what people expect when going to movies like this. Do they leave their sense of wonder at home and just look to pick holes? Well, to summarise my feelings on seeing Beauty and the Beast - I thought it was lovely! It paid respectful homage to the iconic animated original, but can stand on its own two feet as an artistic achievement. The cinematography and set decoration was magnificent, Emma Watson was fresh-faced and feisty as Belle, Luke Evans was a funny and wonderfully hateful Gaston and the musical numbers were well staged (Emma has a sweet voice which suits the songs). Only down side was that we didn't get to see very much of Dan Stevens out of beast mode - but can't help the story-line! I thought that the beast CGI was effective and managed to convey both the savage and vulnerable sides of the character. Go and see it, take your movie critic hat off and prepare to lose yourself in this magical movie."

","This was perhaps the most awaited Disney movie of the year for me, because freaking Emma Watson is playing Belle!

Just one of the most powerful line deliveries in the movie that struck a chord. The second one being ""I want much more than this provincial life!"" (I couldn't stop lip-syncing to the whole song.<br/><br/>Beautiful costumes, but I was disappointed not to see the tour of the castle with Cogsworth going ""if it ain't baroque, don't fix it"" because the resplendent Rococo sets were something I so badly wanted to discover! I hope we get to see in the Blu-rays deleted scenes or something. If not, I hope the creators make a virtual reality app/game/story or something! Disney, make it happen?<br/><br/>There were so many times I was flowing with the story line, seeing the animated Bella flawlessly emoted by Emma. But there were so many times I just saw Emma Watson, that mega star who is a role model for all young kids, and I really saw ""UN Women"" flashing in my head. Some places, she was Belle, some places she was Emma and I'm still not sure how to feel about it. I think it's super hard for me to see her anything other than herself because she's so powerfully iconic as is Belle. *sigh* But if I'm already feeling this was, I guess I feel as though she was miscast.<br/><br/>""How does a moment last forever"" by Celine Dion and ""Evermore,"" and ""Days in the sun"" are definitely gonna be played on loop the whole month and added to my ""Extreme fave playlist"" on iPod.<br/><br/>Belle's dress. Totes not disappointed, but couldn't help but notice Emma's quirky mannerisms and gestures with her hands throughout the dance. She has a way of making ""swan neck"" arm + paw gestures, which are very her, so I was distracted by that..<br/><br/>Belle's lack of ""awe"" to the ""Be our guest"" song and many other scenes.. I can only describe it as a mildly amused reactions... In a lot of the scenes in fact, they were not emoted to its full potential, and I was left feeling ""WHY ISN'T SHE FEELING WHAT I'M FEELING!"" Like I said, I feel she was miscast. She wasn't as lively as Belle was...<br/><br/>Also, Belle and Dan's chemistry was nothing compared to Belle and Beast's chemistry. That ""became human again"" and dance scene post that was super bland... And I'm sure I'm not the only one who feels this way..<br/><br/>Dull directing, not half as grand and cinematic as it could have been.

"kailomonkey","9","2","6","24 March 2017"," Great conversion of the original. Emma Watson a bit out of place.
","Watched this one yesterday and in my opinion, it came off way better than the modern jungle book remake. The CGI animation is much better suited to this story while keeping the essence intact. The movie didn't always carry the right momentum and the new songs were a bit hit and miss, but that sits in line with the original songs which were fun and memorable but half the time a bit sing-what-you-could- just-say-or-are-doing, but perfectly passable relative to its predecessor.<br/><br/>The main thing that let the movie down for me was Emma Watson. I don't think she's a bad actress or have anything personal against her, but most the time her sort of face squint she does isn't what we want to see. She tries to hard to act, sometimes this works in strong emotional scenes, but most the time she's supposed to represent an innocence she just doesn't seem to have. The last foible is that at times her interaction with all-CG elements including The Beast, look awkward and displaced. Mostly this isn't the case, but sometimes it is and it is off-putting. That's not to say it's all her fault: it could be down to direction that things are left wrong...<br/><br/>Despite the issues I have with Belle, she still carries the story perfectly well and the film is just as enjoyable as the older Disney animation. Excellent use of our current age of technology and the songs still feel right at home."
"eddie_baggins","6","2","6","23 March 2017"," This beast is a visual beauty, but lacks heart
","Before we get down to business it's only right that I admit to never having seen the beloved Beauty and the Beast Disney animation from 1991, a film that clearly holds a special spot in people's hearts, as well as being regarded as one of quintessential telling's of the Beauty and the Beast story.<br/><br/>To be even more honest, I've never seen or read an iteration of the Beauty and the Beast story at all, for whatever reason, so my feelings leading up towards the release of this modern day retelling of the famous story were probably quite different to many other's and regardless of how the populace feels about this film as it stands, its already a huge box office smashing hit that will likely see Disney have another film enter into the famed billion dollar club in the coming weeks/months.<br/><br/>Now the actual film itself as directed by Dreamgirls helmer Bill Condon is one that will likely appease hard-core fans and newbies alike thanks to its sumptuous production design and often visually captivating settings but for a story that's seemingly remained as popular as ever over a number of years, no doubt through its emotionally charged and magical story, this lavishly produced music filled romantic fantasy is a rather cold experience when it comes down to the nitty gritty of love against the odds story at its core.<br/><br/>In the biggest test of her career yet, Hogwarts graduate Emma Watson has the relatively daunting task of bringing screen heroine Belle back to the big time in a performance filled with singing, impressive costume changes and the requirement to act alongside CGI tea-cups and the at the time non-furry beast and she makes a good fist of it without ever really becoming a standout. It shows the still learning actress is capable of carrying a film but it's unlikely her turn will be regarded as a new Disney staple in the female heroine stakes.<br/><br/>Arguably with the tougher job, still relatively unknown Dan Stevens does a fine job of becoming the Beast, under the disguise of some noteworthy CGI work (the Beast often looks almost photo real in the right circumstances) he performs well but a major problem Condon's film has is within its chemistry between the two leads and while individually they're fine, as an on screen budding romance there's no real fire, merely a flicker and no amount of visual pizazz was ever going to carry the film past a certain point if this was to be the case.<br/><br/>There's able support from co-stars like Luke Evan's as the despicable Gaston and Kevin Kline as Belle's father Maurice while a couple of the A-list voice stars such as Ewan McGregor and Emma Thompson try their best to make the various household objects cursed alongside the Beast work, but at times McGregor in particular seems to be trying a little too hard to be French while Thompson's ""poppet"" filled script work grates after a while.<br/><br/>The other somewhat lacking component of this updated Beast is the fact that for a musical, a lot of the big singing set pieces never truly fly. Perhaps spoilt from recent musical masterpiece La La Land the big song and dance numbers within Condon's film are more tolerable than toe-tappingly exciting and bar a nice opening number as Belle sings her way through her local village, the rest of the films well liked and no doubt well known songs do seem to lack that certain magical touch that would've made this well-meaning experience fly rather than simply amble along.<br/><br/>This Beauty and the Beast is without doubt a beauty but in the grand scheme of things this box office behemoth is but a pleasant experience without ever threatening to be a great one and while this entertaining popcorn event will be a popular date night pick and a new favourite for little wannabe Disney princesses everywhere, it's unlikely this re-telling of the ever popular source material will ever be regarded as fondly as its hairy forefathers.<br/><br/>3 ""papa's"" out of 5"
"RforFilm","5","2","6","22 March 2017"," The look and production of Beauty and the Beast lets everyone be their guest, but this tale as old as time is better animated
","When I was helping my parents move a couple of years ago, I came across a bunch of old photos, including an old Halloween picture of me dressed as Lumière when I was five. Yes, Beauty and the Beast was that wonderful animated movie that everyone has pretty much seen. It's my all time favorite of the traditional fairy tale stories from Disney, and for good reason. The characters are perfect, the animation is perfect, the songs are perfect, and the story is perfect. It was also the first animated movie to receive a best picture nomination at the Oscars and has a long running Broadway show.<br/><br/>It remains one of Disney's most popular and profitable movies of all time, so it made sense that they would want to return to it. Given how Maleficent, Cinderella, and The Jungle Book live action remakes have done incredibly well, it seems that this tale as old as time would be eyed for that same fate. Whats difficult about adapting this story in this manner is figuring out what to expand. The other movies had a lot of areas from their stories to explore into, but how do you expand the world of Beauty and the Beast? ...let's see.<br/><br/>Like in the animated movie, a vain prince turns away an ugly old woman from his castle, despite being warned about inner beauty. When he dismisses her again, she reveals herself an sorceress and transforms him into the Beast (played by Dan Stevens) and a curse is placed on the castle and everyone inside. <br/><br/>Cut to twenty years later where a book obsessed young woman Belle (played by Emma Watson) makes the best of her life within her small french village. Former army captain and hunter Gaston (played by Luke Evans) eyes her as a wife, but she wants nothing to do with it. <br/><br/>When Belles father Maurice (played by Kevin Kline) ends up locked up in the castle that he stumbled upon, Belle goes there to get him out. Though the Beast frightens her, she agrees to take her fathers place. This makes her a prisoner, but she gets a nice room. Helping them out is candlestick Lumière (played by Ewan McGregor), clock Cogsworth (played by Ian McKellen) and Teapot Mrs. Potts (played by Emma Thompson). A romance seems to bloom for Belle and the Beast, but Gaston and help from his friend Lefou (played by Josh Gad) are trying to stop it. <br/><br/>It's amazing just how close this movie follows the original Beauty and the Beast. Unfortunately, it follows it way too close. While it's not completely shot-for-shot (like the Psycho remake), there are plenty of moments when it feels like the idea was to take many of the famous images from the animated movie and do it again. I guess I can say what's different is the look. A lot of that has to do with the fact that it's live action, but the production value is gorgeous. I'll bet a million dollars that this wins a lot of the Oscars next year for costume, makeup, and production design.<br/><br/>How does the cast stack up? They seem to do alright. The best newcomers are Kevin Kline and Josh Gad as they seemed to be the only ones to really bring something new to their characters. The rest like Ewan McGregor, Luke Evans and Ian McKellen do fine, but the worst has to be the films main character Belle, Emma Watson. Not only is it clear that they auto tuned her voice for the songs, but she still looks too much like a girl while I had pictured Belle as a woman (Olivia Wilde would have been my choice).<br/><br/>I'll give this five Lumière candlesticks out of ten. On it's own, it's okay to sometimes good. I can see a lot of people getting swept up in the world more then the characters. It's just that I'll always be comparing this to the superior animated movie. I see this as totally pointless, but my theater clapped at the end, so I'm sure it'll make a lot of people happy at least. Your invited to be the movie's guest, but I'll decline the next invitation."

","I wish I could love this movie more. I wish that I could think that it is a nice new look at the story with some cool twists and ad ons, but sadly it is not for me. Beauty and the Beast is a try hard movie that just doesn't live up to the hype around it. The animated classic is a best picture winner ad this film tries to be a shot by shot adaptation of it, but it sadly simply doesn't have the spunk of the original. <br/><br/>The film does do some very good things. I did find a lot of strength in the character of Belle and a lot of energy in Emma Watson's performance. It was a very good performance and one of the more positive things about the film as a whole that I really liked about it. I was really taken in by all the time and commitment she had put into this role. <br/><br/>The set design of this film is also quite good. I loved how pretty this film looked and was one of the things that really grabbed me about this movie and made it more enjoyable for me. Every design of the film mad me more interested in learning about the world they inhabit and just staying inside it. <br/><br/>Sadly we have to leave all that beauty for a lot of slow meaningless padding. This film just feels too long. With 2 hours in length the film just goes on and on. The animated classic was only a hour and about 15 mins and told it's story quickly and very welly. This film drags everything out and makes it all too lengthy and I hated that about it. <br/><br/>Also people made such a big deal about Le Fou being gay well then all you gay haters can get over it and all you supporters can feel very whatever about it, because they do nothing with it. They literally just sit on it and have a few lines here or there, but for the most part if that is what your worried about then don't be. <br/><br/>Overall Beauty and the Beast is a slow moving film that meanders a lot and doesn't know how to tell this story in a captivating way."
"iapage-375-928255","9","2","6","22 March 2017"," Wonderful rendition!
","I thought it was a really good version of Disney's Beauty and the Beast. I will be buying it for my video library. I laughed, I cried, and returned to my childhood in all the right places. Unless you are watching it to find fault, you will enjoy it. Possible Spoiler Alert: Yes, as all versions are, it is a musical; and no, (and I am happy either way) I don't think Emma really sang... I loved it!<br/><br/>I gave it a 9 out of 10 because the singing voice that initially comes from Emma is tonally different than her own and so a bit of a shock. I got used to it, though."

"willowgoldencat","7","2","6","20 March 2017"," Beautiful, but lacking of soul
","I love the 1991 original, so I was expecting a stunning live-action/CGI reproduction and a magical 3D/IMAX experience. Basically, this film met my expectations. It is beautiful, especially the library scenes and the yellow dress. Lumiere the Candelabra and those CG wolves are also more expressive than their animated version. <br/><br/>However, as the core character Belle, Emma Watson really didn't do a good job. Actually, I quite like Hermione Granger in Harry Potter films, but I am very surprised at how awful she acts in Beauty and the beast. Her performance almost had no emotions and made this film lacking of soul. It was far sub-standard for a professional."
"Rendanlovell","6","2","6","19 March 2017"," Fine if superfluous.
","Recently Disney has become fixated on remaking, rebooting, or re- imaging their older films. This film is the third live action remake of one of Disney's classic animated films. So this is a remake of an animated adaptation of a french fairy tale (working title). If you haven't seen the classic animated film or just don't remember it the story goes as follows: Lady falls in love with monster. Of course there's underlying theme's and messages to take away but that's basically the story. It's simple and easy to understand. This is probably the greatest strength of the animated film. The story isn't over burdened by much else, it's just a love story with whimsical characters and house hold appliances that sing. <br/><br/>It's in these details where this remake falls short. While it's essentially a shot for shot remake of the original there are a few things added. And every single thing added to this that didn't exist in the original feel so out of place and overly convoluted that it's hard to take them seriously. There's an entire subplot added to this film where Belle is attempting to find out how her mother died.<br/><br/>It only comes up a few times and it's not really even written into the story. We have the original story and, all of a sudden, Belle discovers that her mom and dad lived in a windmill in Paris. Like, why? Why is this even included in the story? It doesn't add any depth to her or her father. It basically is just there to say that her dad loves her, which I think we can all reasonably infer already. <br/><br/>There are various other added scenes and all of them feel roughly the same as this one. They all come from nowhere, add nothing, and then are completely forgotten about because they serve absolutely no purpose. This is where remakes become frustrating. On one hand, you want to see something new but if you go in a completely new direction people complain. And if you make a shot for shot remake, people complain.<br/><br/>There's this tiny gray area in between these two extremes where a remake is almost acceptable. Look at 'The Force Awakens' for reference. While that film was essentially just a remake of 'A New Hope' there were new characters, a new threat, new environments, and new ideas being presented. 'Beauty and the Beast' falls just shy of being a shot for the shot remake by simply adding a new song or two and a few scenes.<br/><br/>It feels like the same movie but with the deleted scenes added in. That's both the biggest flaw and greatest accomplishment of this film. It's obnoxious to watch a worse version of the same movie but where this movie works best is in the scenes that are pulled straight from the cartoon. Seeing this massive budget bring to life the jaw- dropping castle and characters was really neat.<br/><br/>As much as I dislike Disney movies they do know how to utilize a budget. The sets, costumes, makeup, and CG all look spectacular. There were many scenes where I was left in awe of how good this movie looked and how much effort was seemingly put into making it look that good. And this is where all my respect for the film goes. They did an absolutely brilliant job bringing the cartoon to life. <br/><br/>But that's, unfortunately, all this film is good for. It doesn't have an identity of its own. It wants to be the original but also wants to be its own thing and ends up being neither. There are some beautiful sets, costumes, and inspired recreations of the classics songs yet the film falters in nearly every other way. Its story is clouded by illogical and overly convoluted subplots that just sort of dead end and add nothing. While I am still strongly against remaking classic films, I can say that out of the three live action cartoon remakes we have gotten this is the best, but not by much. Just, make new things, please."

Totally charmless.<br/><br/>For the film itself, the production had all the fancy direction of a west end musical. I think this may have scored it well with big critics but to a true Disney fan it felt totally forced. Bland. Cold.

","This is by far the absolute best live action Disney movie out there. Emma Watson was the perfect Belle. The whole movie was cast perfectly and made for an entertaining time.

"kermitkid","9","1","2","30 March 2020"," Tale as old as time....yet still somewhat new
","I was extremely skeptical about this movie. I actually thoght the people who saw it opening weekend were suckers. Why would I see a movie that I already own, just with a different cast? Why should I support this extremely blatant cashgrab? But after literally almost everyone I know raving about how amazing and marvelous it was, I finally decided ""Well, I haven't really heard anything bad about it. I'll give it a chance."", and I'm glad I did. This was amazing! Everything from the sets, to the costumes, to the CGI, to the acting was marvelous. I dare say that in some ways it was even better than the original. I try to keep my reviews spoiler free, but unfortunately mild spoilers are needed in this review so I can give specific reasons why I thonk this is superior to the animated one, so if you don't want spoilers stop reading now.
Some complaints that most people had with the animated version were:
""Why does the witch curse the beast when he was a child and was only following stranger danger rules?""
""Why did all the servants get cursed too? They were innocent!""
""Why does everyone turn their nose up at Belle for reading of all things?""<br/><br/>Here's what happened. This version makes more sense and that is why I think this one is superior.
It begins with the Beast (as a human) as a young adult and he is at a ball with potential suitors one of whom will be his wife. Big age difference. The line in ""Be Our Guest"" changes from ""For 10 years we have been rusting,"" to ""For so long we have been rusting.""
The servants were cursed because after the Beast's mom the queen died, his father became cruel and abusive, and the servants got cursed because they just stood by and watched. (Which doesn't make much sense either, but it's better than the ""Because they just happened to be there"" reason in the original)
Everyone is a jerk to Belle because they are illilterate, so it doesn't make sense for her to read.<br/><br/>The songs were awesome! I had no idea Emma Watson had such an amazing voice. Ewan McGregor still can't do accents, but his singing is still pretty good. Dan Stevens (The Beast) should be on Broadway, because he has some impressive singing chops. Luke Evans (Gaston) doesn't sound brutish enough, which is one aspect where the animated is slightly better, but they made up for that by making him a creepy stalker, so it balances out. Josh Gad....oh boy....well,....he does his typical schtick. I don't like it, but I know what I'm getting. He has one character. He's not good, but I knew what I was getting going in to it. As much as I hate to say it, I'm actually quite excited for the next Disney live action remakes. Are they unneccesary? Yes. Will they be good? Who knows, but if they do what they did here, I think they will be.
Grade: A- 9/10 4/5 stars"
"phd_travel","5","1","2","18 November 2019"," Beautiful production but Emma Watson is wrong
","This movie boasts stunning sets and delightful animation with an expanded story. Maybe a little too much story.<br/><br/>The main flaw is Emma Watson is wrong. She looks like a young teen and speaks and looks like Hermione still. Too childish. Other recent Disney heroines have been better like Lily James In Cinderella or Lily Collins in Snow White. The singing should have been dubbed by real Broadway or West End performers. Luke Evans as Gaston being a real stage performer is more convincing.<br/><br/>Still worth a watch."

"crosswalkx","3","1","2","24 July 2019"," Bored with the Beast remake and the awful Lefou rainbow hype.
","I have seen this remake in theaters and I was extremely bored throughout this Disney remake, I never want to see it again. I did like the costumes and the Gaston dance numbers, the Beast was good but Belle was awful in this movie.<br/><br/>It starts off with the spoiled Prince who gets turned into a Beast and his guest into inanimate objects, then Belle goes into town singing like Hannah Montana which was painful for me to listen to, Belle gets harassed by Gaston who's desperately wanting to marry Belle, Belles father Maurice makes music boxes instead of inventing an axe chopping machine like in the original cartoon. Maurice gets lost in the woods he picks the rose like in the original story and the Beast threatens to kill him but spares his life and has Belle take his place. Belle meets Mrs. Potts, Lumiere, Cogsworth, Chip and has to learn to get along with the beast.<br/><br/>Belle gets to visit her old home which was plagued and her mother died. Belle and the Beast dance in a hetero love moment. Meanwhile Maurice goes to town for help but Gaston leaves him to die in the forest but is saved by Belle. But the town mob locks Belle and Maurice up. They storm the castle and flee in defeat but Gaston uses his shotgun to shoot the beast before falling to his death, Belle loves the Beast and the spell is broken and everybody is back to normal.<br/><br/>First of all I hated Belle's character, what the heck were Disney thinking? Where's her dramatic anger and sadness or her being happy or the fun or joking like the 2D cartoon? Why doesn't Belle show real emotion, it's like she read from a movie script in monotones, In the plays I was in, our drama teacher always pushed us to show real emotion, but they obviously didn't have Emma Watson do that, what about singing the real way and not this awful Hannah Montana auto tuning, I'm very disappointed in Belles character she was just another Mary Sue woman for the womens rights movement agenda.<br/><br/>I liked the Beast, at least he showed love and compassion even when Belle didn't at all.<br/><br/>I didn't really care for Gaston in this version very much, he wasn't as fun as the cartoon Gaston in the original cartoon, he was just a total jerk and darn boring.<br/><br/>I would've liked Lefou, he was funny and caring about other people, danced with people, had they not made him a rainbow coming out the closet, I'm very annoyed about the rainbow hype they turned him into just for the political rainbow flag agenda which I'm sick and tired of.<br/><br/>The household objects were very boring to watch, I was very underwhelmed with the Be Our Guest Song and Something There song, come on Disney you have these amazing CGI animations and special effects, where's the fun and emotion for Lumiere, Cogsworth, Mrs. Potts, and Chip? They didn't feel like fun characters, they felt like robot characters with no emotion. The 2D cartoons were way more fun and entertaining to watch than this boring 3D lifeless emotion characters.<br/><br/>I did like the costumes and the music and CGI animation in the film it was really amazing, but the acting is just not as good as the Broadway play.<br/><br/>Anyways this remake movie is a total letdown, I'm very disappointed in this Disney remake, If you want a better Beauty and the Beast movie, I suggest you watch the 1946 Black and White movie, or watch the 1987 live action MGM musical, or watch the 1991 Disney cartoon which is the greatest Disney cartoon classic, or the live action French version in 2014 by Christophe Gans starring Vincent Cassel and Léa Seydoux which is by the way the greatest live action version I've ever seen and my favorite film of all time. Or go watch the Broadway Beauty and the Beast play, also much better than this boring live action remake which I'll never rewatch again.<br/><br/>Overall I would rate this Disney movie PG-13 for mild language, some violence, abuse, scary scenes, peril, mild sexual reference."
"cvonbarron","Null","1","2","2 July 2019"," Lacks the charm and energy of the original.
","I was reading a review of the original animated on this site once after watching it. Someone pointed out something i hadn't noticed. In the original it states that the rose would bloom until the Beast's 21st birthday. In ""Be our Guest"", Lumiere sings the following lyric: ""10 years we've been rusting needing so much more than dusting"". This would mean that the beast was 11 when cursed. That being said, it seemed awfully cruel of the lady to curse him he probably reacted that way out of fear not selfishness. It bothered me until i watched the remake. This film is a perfect example of the old adage, ""Just because you can do something doesn't mean you should"". What surprised me about the film was how lifeless it seemed. Emma Watson is a pretty girl but she seemed almost too prim and proper for the role. The original film had a marvelous voice cast and, because they had only their voices they went all out. The energy and warmth they brought to the film made it timeless. This live action version fixes the aforementioned plot hole by making the time that the castle had been enchanted indeterminate. BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER. I thought at the time that it was a good thing but after the movie ended, it struck me that the film was a soulless creation lacking the magic of the original. There is an alternate explanation in the animated film. The beast was 16 when cursed but, because of the spell,time passed more slowly for the people and objects in the castle. So, while in the outside world 5 years had gone the occupants of the castle would have experienced it as 10. So again, just because the live action version fixed it didn't make it a better movie. Disney is capable of making good movies but, over the last 5 years it seems like whatever creativity they had is gone. All they want to do is remake their animated films as live action. They even did it with Star Wars. Same product in a new shinier package. Only the packaging is different. It's a shame."

I did however watch both this and the original recently and in my opinion the original isn't any better. In fact, it has some drawbacks compared to this remake.
Yes, the beast is too CGI looking and all of the autotune on Emma Watson and other's singing is excessive to say the least.
The scene in the remake where everyone freeze as their inanimate object spells is amazing and the scene where everyone turn back to humans is moving and magical.

","As a child, I dreamed of being a princess. You can imagine my excitement when Disney announced they were bringing one of their princess films to life but even better it would be Beauty and the Beast. Belle was my all-time favorite princess with her overwhelming amount of kindness, her ability to stand her ground, and her sacrifice for those she loves. She was a role model to me. The live action announced their cast and I was skeptical but excited because of their beautiful recreation of Cinderella. I doubted the possibility of failure when it came to the magnificent story tellers that Disney has. However, the live action Beauty and the Beast would fall short ultimately leaving me disappointed and begging Disney to try again. It was a film filled with the overuse of computer-generated technology, a lifeless portrayal in acting skills, the overuse of auto-tune instead of actual singing, and overshadowing the film with new themes that don't present themselves. I would give this film and overall 3/10 stars.
Beauty and the Beast is a tale as old as time. Generations have shared their love for the story that teaches us to look beyond appearance but at the heart. It tells the tale of a young gal named Belle who lives with her quirky father. She is seen as unique among her town but her beauty surpasses all those around her truly captivating them. She has even caught the attention of a handsome yet conceited fellow who attempts to persuade the Belle to marry him. Her father sets out on a journey and her request upon his return is a single rose. Along the way her father gets lost and seeks refuge in a lone castle he stumbles upon. He is welcomed by enchanted house supplies who help make his stay pleasant but their master isn't keen on their new guest. The beast decides it is best to lock her father away. Belle soon learns of her father's disappearance and sets out to find him. Once she learns of what has happened she sacrifices herself out of unconditional love for her father. He pleads with her not do this but the Beast who needs true love to break the curse he and his servants are under. He obliges and takes her instead because he is in awe of Belle's willingness to give up everything for her father. Belle in her time will learn to see past simply appearance and the Beast will learn what sacrificial love truly means.
The film served as yet another colorful addition to Disney's film collection with its beautiful cinematography. They have many costumes designed perfectly for each character and adds a flare of color to each scene. Nevertheless, the computer-generated imagery was overdone and seems to take away from the natural beauty that the film had. They try and modernize each character taking away from their classic animated versions. The Beast especially holds a scarier appearance than his cartoon face. It is a bit harder to enjoy the film due to their overuse of CGI that ruins the potential the film had.
Disney announced their casting for the movie which caused fans to be skeptical of their choices or caused excitement for what was seen as an unexpected cast full of potential. Ewan McGregor and Josh Gad were both previously in musicals and did an exquisite job when it came to bringing their characters to life. Luke Evans and Dan Stevens surprised the audience with their rendition of their characters along with other actors. However, everyone was most excited to see the Emma Watson bring our beloved Belle to the big screen. Nevertheless, Emma seemed to miss the mark greatly of who Belle was. Emma lacked emotion and ended up giving us a lifeless portrayal of Belle. Instead of re-creating Belle, Emma tends to recreate her past character Hermonie causing the film to fall short with a misconception of who the Belle is.
Every Disney musical has magnificent vocals that will capture their audience hearts. The film had some powerhouse singers casted such as Ewan McGregor, Josh Gad, and Luke Evans who simply seemed to fall flat in the area of singing. The expectations they were given upon being announced to the film just was not met in the slightest. Nevertheless, their co-star Emma Watson had taken many vocal lessons to play the part of Belle but was overshadowed by auto-tune. This being said her voice wasn't pleasant to listen to and lacked the necessary emotion that we were given in the classic Disney film. It would have been better if they coached their actors to apply the much needed emotion to their voices that a musical generally has as well as hire someone with prior singing abilities rather than relying on auto-tone for the star of their production.
Furthermore, Disney would announce new themes such as a homosexual character and a feminist princess that would ultimately turn an audience away rather than draw them in with excitement. It was an announcement that would shock the audience. However, upon viewing the film neither themes were prominent enough to notice. It left the audience confused because of the hype that was centered around these major new plot additions. Nevertheless, fans were relieved that they didn't steer far from the original film with these additions but questions arose on why the announcements were made in the first place.
Disney decided they would make a live-action version of the beloved tale Beauty and the Beast upon their success with prior live-actions they have recently made. It was expected to be a beautiful rendition that would capture the hearts of a new audience and reach generations that dearly loved the film. However, newer would not prove to be better. The film lacked Disney's usual magic touch with inadequate acting, insufficient singing, dismal computer-generated technology, and new themes that were faulty. The film left the audience wanting more and disappointed with the final product."

","Too much unessesary characters, decors, songs. One big mess with no chemistry. Ema Watson was horrible as Bell, the beast was even worst. Very disappointing."
"MickeyTheConstant","7","1","2","9 March 2019"," A good modern version of a classic
","I was a bit confused with this one. I kind of liked it but then at times found myself thinking, was it worth it. It differs little to the classic Disney movie. An extended tale, a few more songs thrown it. I genuinely preferred the animated version which had a bit more charm. Maybe it's a nostalgia thing. Evans was great as Gaston and the rest of the cast were excellent to. The CGI was fine and the reimagining of some of the scenes was excellent. The only real negatives for me was the running time, which could have been 20-30 mins less and also the murdering of the song Tale As Old As Time. Lansbury and the original were just so much better. I preferred the original but at the same time can't say I didn't enjoy it. Worth a watch"

","I was never a fan of the 1991 version so I had no nostalgia to overcome.

Emma Watson was wonderful and sweet as Belle (and I enjoyed the ""I'm not a princess"" lìne). The shared interests and sweet moments between Belle and the Beast make their romance look less like Stockholm syndrome than other versions. The casting was excellent across the board and the voice actors so much less irritating than in 1991 ( I really am not a fan)"
"Travelwings","5","1","2","18 February 2019"," Maybe a one time watch but didn't meet the high standards of Disney movies.
","This movie doesn't match the high standards of Disney movies and I would have rather seen this made into an animation than with real life actors. I expected a big deal and I found no substance. Also I could have done with a little less of Gaston ! A whole song for him? Really? I think I saw Gaston in the movie much more than Belle and the Beast."
"TheVictoriousV","4","1","2","17 January 2019"," ""Updated"" graphics isn't an improvement and tears of nostalgia don't denote quality
","I was still able to see the bad signs as they manifested. The trailers implied that it wasn't really a ""remake"" so much as it was a re-skin - with special thanks to my brother for the term - and the purportedly improved visuals looked either corny or awkward. I ultimately had two mutually exclusive questions: ""What exactly are you adding/fixing in this fairy tale that justifies it being remade?"" and ""If all you're doing is remake the film shot-for-shot, scene-for-scene, song-for-song but with 'better graphics', why?"" Of course I realize that the answer is probably member berries and money, but let's see what has been put forth anyway!<br/><br/>We join Belle (Emma Watson, cursed to forever be typecast as the most beautiful woman alive), an inventor's daughter and bibliophile who astonishes her fellow villagers with her beauty but turns them away with her anachronistic book-smarts and the fact that her father is the town loon Maurice (Kevin Kline). In spite of this, she is eyed by a suave hunter named Gaston, the chauvanistic town hero who, as you're well aware if you've heard the songs, has biceps to spare and uses antlers in all his decorating.<br/><br/>You know how the rest goes too, I'm assuming. Maurice becomes lost in the woods, Belle finds him locked up in a secluded fortress ruled by a horrific Beast (Dan Stevens), who was made that way ages ago by an enchantress for his superficial ways, and vows to take her father's place in the Beast's captivity. Living in the castle, Belle befriends the Beast's enchanted servants, as we learn that the spell will be broken if she can learn to love the Beast, before the magical rose in his room withers, in spite of his monstrous appearance - for true beauty is found within. Turned into various household objects for daring to obey a spoiled snot, the servants of the castle are Ewan McGregor as Lumière the candelabra, Ian McKellen as Cogsworth the mantel clock, Emma Thompson as Mrs. Potts the teapot, Stanley Tucci as a cembalo that wasn't in the original film, Gugu Mbatha-Raw as the feather duster, under-used Audra McDonald as a walking closet, et cetera.<br/><br/>To discuss the characters in general, I was made skeptical by the promo clips and proven right by the finished product. The strength and emotional range of the animated Belle is rarely displayed by her live-action duplicate (for which they try to compensate by giving her more adventerous things to do, even though that's not the problem) and Dan Stevens' Beast does not hold the same wrath or intimidating presence as that of the original. As for the enchanted objects looking unexpressive, kind of eerie, and more like they belong in an advanced Annoying Orange short as opposed to a live-action picture show, I'd prefer not to make any comments beyond that.<br/><br/>That said, you can't fault the actors for evidently having a good time with the material. Gaston in this version is played by Luke Evans, and he enjoys what he does to such an extent that you can excuse his singing voice. Gaston's right-hand-oaf LeFou is portrayed by Josh Gad and he entertains even when he isn't really funny.<br/><br/>I don't need to remind anyone that the film is very much indeed a re-do of the Disney movie rather than any sort of unique take on Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont's fable. However, it does lift elements from other iterations of the fairy tale. The Beast, for instance, closely resembles Ron Perlman's Vincent from the Beauty and the Beast TV drama. It's not a great effect, though, and it looks like they made an attempt to make The Beast more ""handsome-looking"", which (A) misses the point of the story completely, (B) didn't actually work, and (C) is a horrifying thing to contemplate no matter how accepting I've become of the notion that furries exist.<br/><br/>The musical numbers are as underwhelming in how they're staged as in how they're shot, which is rooted in the same problem as the character designs and the overall look of the film; you cannot replicate the energy or exaggerations of 2D animation with 3D tools or real-life actors. It often seems as if there wasn't even an effort to do so; the musical scenes in this movie would be boring to watch even if I didn't have a superior animation to compare it to. The ""Gaston"" song is filmed on a cramped set with uncertain extras and the cinematography and imagery during ""Belle"" wouldn't seem out-of-place in a Saturday Night Live skit that parodies the fact that this was made (""Be Our Guest"" is the number that succeeds the most, in my opinion). The editing is equally tactless.<br/><br/>Its dull look can also be explained by the fact that it employs the same blue-ish filter that just about every other Hollywood production uses these days in what is commonly thought to be a misguided attempt to make movies look more realistic. To quote a recent Cracked article about how modern blockbusters appear remarkably colorless: ""At its darkest parts, the cartoon was still vivid ... Even at its brightest parts, the new movie is muted and sad-looking. Because according to Disney, if you suck out the color, the cursed man-beast is suddenly grounded and authentic.""<br/><br/>Although I will not go so far as to call Beauty and the Beast dreadful, I am at a loss. I cannot think of any reason why this is better than the film it uses as a template (give or take the odd bit of filler). As I've noted, it's not the characters or the images and certainly not its efforts to be more relevant by having a few kernels of modern-day gender politics in there (they traded the montage where Belle teaches Beast how to read with a scene where he condescendingly explains Shakespeare to her). Alan Menken's songs are not necessarily made better by having Howard Ashman's witty lyrics replaced by slightly different ones by Tim Rice either. It does explain why the woods are snowy in the summer and why the peasants seem oblivious to the spell, and we also get a darker climax but that's about it. And no, it doesn't answer any unsettling questions about which people affected by the spell can still age and which objects truly used to be human as opposed to being sentient furniture with no purpose or ability to scream.<br/><br/>If you're going to teach a new generation of viewers a valuable lesson about love, appearances, and other stuff they won't actually remember, may I insist you instead show them a similarly titled 1991 movie with more heart, depth, energy, and color that wasn't made solely because theatrical re-releases are less profitable in the age of home video, streaming, and piracy? They have removed the things that made it appealing to look at, altered things that weren't necessary, and kept just enough to make it completely unsurprising. But it's based on something I recognize so overall it's good. 10/10.<br/><br/>I suppose Cogsworth was right. If it's not baroque, don't fix it."

","Would you please ""Be our guest"" as we revisit Disney's animated classic in the live film adaption? Beauty and the Beast is not my favourite film (gasp in horror here). In fact, at a younger age I would find myself mocking it due to all the mushy (somewhat girly) romance themes. Regardless, I have to admit, Beauty and the Beast is ultimately a Disney classic for many with a solid story and many music numbers that will stick in your head (and heart) forever.<br/><br/>In case you've been locked up in a castle... the story is about a young prince, who becomes imprisoned in the form of a Beast due to his selfishness. The Beast can only be freed from the spell by the power true love. An opportunity occurs when the Beast meets a young woman named Belle.<br/><br/>This isn't the first time that Disney has turned one of our favourite animations into a live adaption. Previously we have seen live action remakes of the Jungle Book and Cinderella which have all proven to be worthwhile at the box office. I'm pleased to say that once again Disney has succeeded and Beauty and the Beast has been successfully transformed into a live film.<br/><br/>Beauty And The Beast's strongest praise are the characters and the solid casting choices. If I'm honest, Belle (played by Emma Watson), is fun and very easy to fall in love with, but it's actually the film's supporting actors that receive my biggest praise. These include Belle's father (Kevin Kline) and of course, the naughty handsome man, Gaston (Luke Evans). When I heard the actor Luke Evans was playing Gaston I was a little concerned as this role is so different for the actor, but credit where credit is due, he absolutely nailed the character and blew the role out of park...<br/><br/>Visually, as I expected for a Disney film, Beauty and the Beast is outstandingly colourful and has audio effects that should be highly praised. Beauty and the Beast will have the cinema crowd tapping their feet at the returning classic musical tunes and the 3 new, unexpected musical numbers. Besides, it wouldn't really be Beauty and the Beast without the song ""Be Our Guest"" right?<br/><br/>The only one minor flaw for me is the pacing of the film. Many key scenes felt rushed. Certain characters will make an announcement about going somewhere and suddenly they arrive within seconds while other scenes could be classed as a little dragged out. As mentioned, this is a very minor movie issue but I found myself a little surprised at times, as if the film just decided to fast forward for the sake of the film's runtime. But, being a Disney movie, I'm sure this minor issue will not bother movie goers, in particularly the younger generation.<br/><br/>Overall, it was exciting to revisit Beauty And The Beast with added fresh direction and an outstanding cast performance. Even if the film does feel very similar, and sometimes is a shot for shot remake of the 1991 animation, it promises to bring back great memories for many or perhaps create new ones for those who have never heard the tale.<br/><br/>7.4/10

There were a few moments where I didn't think Emma Watson gave the best performance she could musically. She definitely looks the part, playing a stunning Belle, and again, the acting is great, but there are moments where her singing falls a bit flat. Not bad, she's a good singer, but not necessarily great at times.<br/><br/>Other than that little nitpick, I really love this film and it's made me want to go back and rewatch the original."
"proud_luddite","8","1","2","10 February 2018"," Far more than I expected
","A live-action/CGI remake of the 1991 animated musical: Belle (Emma Watson) is an intelligent outcast in her provincial town, pursued by the egomaniacal Gaston (Luke Evans). Across the dangerous woods is a beast (Dan Stevens) who lives in a castle in which he used to be a prince.<br/><br/>Speaking of outcasts, I feel like one myself in my assessments of this modern film and its predecessor. I believe the current film is superior to the earlier one. I found the animated version admirable but over-rated. This goes against the consensus on two counts.<br/><br/>One of the improvements in the current version is in the characterization of LeFou (Josh Gad), Gaston's sidekick. Much is made of the fact that the modern LeFou is gay and infatuated with Gaston. While this bold move is admirable enough, the better move is erasing the plight of the older version of LeFou who was sadistically used as a punching bag for the bullying (and much bigger) Gaston. The previous use of schadenfreude doesn't quite appeal to an audience's better instincts.<br/><br/>Director Bill Condon clearly knows how to make musicals great. (The superb ""Dreamgirls"" (2006) is evidence of this.) Even while being fully aware of the storyline, there is still an excitement and energy for the viewer in this film. Condon has been blessed with a great team particularly those involved with the set design, make-up, visual effects, cinematography, and costumes. In addition, a few new songs have been added to the great ones of the original.<br/><br/>Condon is also blessed with a great cast. Stevens does a fine job conveying the beast's rage as well as the inner-torment hiding behind it. Watson is good too though she could have shown more expression during the film's climax. Even in a small role, Emma Thompson still manages to raise the bar - this time as a talking teapot.<br/><br/>The exciting finale is so joyous, it can lift anyone to the clouds. No wonder this movie is such a box-office blockbuster."

Having said that, I watched it on video and found that I liked it better than I expected. The Beast seemed more sympathetic and educated character than in the animated version, and some of the back story added perspective, not that I couldn't live without it. I am disappointed that as in the original movie they cut ""Human Again,"" but the new songs were OK, and the ones that were dropped were no great loss. I do think many of the negative reviews here were unduly harsh, maybe because they paid full price in the movie theater, but for $8 video, I was entertained and satisfied with my investment."

"alex-klein2424","6","1","2","13 June 2017"," Beauty and the Box Office Beast
","Beauty and the Beast has gone through a lot of movie and TV variations over the years and luckily I have only seen a few. I watched the black and white 1946 French ""La Belle et la Bete"" last year, and I have seen the cartoon countless times but have never watched any of the TV iterations or other movies and I am glad for this otherwise I would say this is movie overload.<br/><br/>Beauty and the Beast is a bright eyed loving remake of the cartoon from the choreography down to the songs and even the script. In many respects that is what makes it fun to watch. As many of you know, I have a very complicated relationship with Hollywood and their remakes and reboots because I hate most of them but when it comes to Disney they have been making some really great live action remakes of their beloved cartoons and this one is no exception. <br/><br/>The casting was spot on, and Emma Watson is a perfect fit for Belle. All of the other characters also shine but I particularly enjoyed Gaston and LeFou as a pair. Luke Evans and Josh Gad, respectively, worked so well off of each other and added some fun comedy to the mix. Most of their interactions were a little over the top but I was able to channel that frustration towards the children behind me kicking my seats. <br/><br/>There were also some really noisy people next to me who kept laughing and shouting and one phone went off as well. It was at this point that I really appreciated the plight of the Beast in the film. I really wanted to attack many people around me and tell them to get out of my castle and as each rose petal fell in the film, so did the rose petals holding my patience together. I think it is very important to note that when you are going to see a movie you should make sure that not only is your phone off but that your crying child is fully out of the theater and not just around the corner so you can still watch the movie. I know it is frustrating that you have a child but also really want to go see this movie from your childhood but a good parent can wait for this movie to come to Netflix instead of forcing a packed theater hear your child scream as the wonderful musical numbers come across the screen.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a great date movie. It is also perfect for those of us who loved the cartoon growing up and don't yet have a young child that doesn't like loud noises. I think while some parts of the movie were over the top, nothing really took away from the movie besides all of the children who took one thousand years to open their bags of candy and as the crunchy sounds of the packaging pushed me over the edge, the soundtrack and score saved me from jumping."
"embless","5","1","2","6 June 2017"," I Yearned To Enjoy This
","Honestly I just finished watching this at home June 6, 2017 as it came out on DVD to rent and/or sell today ..... and I am left with the same feelings ..... it could have been so much better IF ( a big if and in my opinion ) the two main lead characters had been chosen more carefully and had actually wanted to lead the story. Please keep in mind I am a fan of the 1991 version as that is also my birth year, but disregarding that version and taking this film all on its own; I was still perplexed in not a good way by the end of watching this a second time through ( my first had been in the theater ). Even so Belle's (Watson) voice was so crazy auto tuned it literally nearly ruined my concentration and honestly I found the Beast character to be flat as well; both seemed to be truly aiming to help us ( the audience ) understand that they came to do a stage play..... not a film that much was felt by myself. The supporting actors ( the live talking house hold objects ), ( Gaston and his side kick ), ( the towns people ) >ALL< projected and emoted So much more convincingly than the two main leads in this 2017 remake of the 1991 classic. They >ALL< appeared and carried themselves and their voices as if they came to do their jobs above and beyond what's on the manuscript. I admit there are additional scenes in this live-action remake that add nice story filler and contribute to the bulk of the storyline that simply was missing from the 1991 animated version...... but that DID NOT Salvage this film on the whole from this epic train wreck. <br/><br/>Truth be told IF I ignore these few and albeit startling obviously obnoxious glaring annoyances from the minute of the opening frame until the glitzy spaz of an ending...... I can admit it is somewhat a nostalgic feeling to see this live-action version but; IF Only ...... IF Only the lead two main leads had not been so utterly flat lined in how they delivered their individual performances and even together it seemed they had zero chemistry on each scene no matter the situation within the film. <br/><br/>I can personally swallow all the flashy displays of costumes and over dressed up sets, the CG was passable and it seemed they did try to make it glamorous and enchanting which it was, but what wrecked the ballroom scene for me was how pitiful and flat and plain the Belle dress was!!!!! I mean really it was plain and I could assume budget cuts? That yellow dress on Belle is a statement piece of the character and yet I was left with my mouth hanging open in utter dismay and bewildered astonishment upon seeing it for a second time; I was grotesquely underwhelmed. {Trying desperately not to compare it to the 1991 version but BUT)....... The 1991 yellow dress on Belle was just that a gorgeous gown and the character wore NO jewelry or many accessories...... the dress was the main event and even on a animated character it SHOWED CLEARLY! This 2017 version of that yellow gown left me sad and unimpressed to say the least. <br/><br/>Buttttttttttt ......... overall I wish Disney had tried much harder to put out a film worth watching ( and no I do not want a cookie cutter version of the 1991 version ) but I truly enjoyed Maleficent and Cinderella and Jungle Book ......... Why Oh Why is this Beauty & The Beast 2017 lacking? While remakes prior to it are seemingly more enjoyable and make clear that they attempted make it enjoyable for the audience no matter what changes were made etc etc the actors in those seemed to want to be there and absorb the character role and make it their own........ the two main leads in this did no such thing which only did more to reek havoc on the storyline rewrite."

","I have watched the original animated Beauty And The Beast many many times butt still, the movie is super entertaining and just exciting. Butt there is a couple of cons, one of which is every 5 minutes there's gonna be a song. Overall the movie is brilliand, 9/10 would watch again."
"JeffreyRackham","9","3","12","18 March 2017"," Magical, but had a lot to live up to.
","""Beauty and the Beast"" was a fantastic movie altogether although it had a lot to live up to. The original version of the film captured the hearts of millions and is arguably hard to top. This movie would need to meet or exceed the magic of the original and I felt it only met it.<br/><br/>The music is amazing - of course! - especially with the new songs written for the film. The actors do their best to portray their beloved counterparts while bringing a fresh revival to each. Most importantly, this movie just gives you more. The story is new and the visuals are exquisite. This movie does lack, however. Disney could have done more for the story to make it unique. The story in itself felt rushed at times - like we don't already know the essentials! - and so it made it feel just a bit less magical.<br/><br/>Even though I feel Disney went above and beyond to help answer questions and give us more to the story that was lacking from the original, we leave with different questions that I wish could have been explained. Now, as for the live-action portrayal in general, Cinderella was better - granted, it set the standard for these remakes - because there was no standard other than having Disney not mess up a classic. Here, everything was on the line, and Disney did admirably, but overall just couldn't quite make a perfect 10/10 movie for this Disney enthusiast."
"joshbarton15","8","3","12","18 March 2017"," Tale as old as time gets a worthy remake.
","Disney are full steam ahead with live action remakes of their beloved animated classics, with Pete's Dragon and The Jungle Book getting the treatment last year. This year however sees Disney take the biggest risk yet with a live action remake of Beauty and the Beast, which is widely thought of as one of the studio's best ever animated films and loved by so many of all ages around the world.<br/><br/>Beauty and the Beast tells the tale of Belle (Emma Watson), a girl seen as strange by the rest of her fellow villagers but sought after by the arrogant Gaston (Luke Evans). When Belle learns of her father, Maurice (Kevin Kline), being held captive in a hidden castle, she takes his place, becoming the prisoner of Beast (Dan Stevens), a once handsome prince cursed by an enchantress for not seeing that true beauty lies within, before they fall in love with one another.<br/><br/>As soon as Beauty and the Beast finished, I breathed a huge sigh of relief. Not because it had finished and I couldn't wait to get out of there but because Disney had avoided tarnishing their animated classic and had actually made a very good film, much better than I was expecting anyway.<br/><br/>Lavish in both its production and costume design, Beauty and the Beast very much looks the part of a live action Disney adaptation with gorgeous practical sets and colourful frocks aplenty. The visual effects, as expected these days, really are very good as well, bringing the film and its animated characters to life with great verve, particularly Lumiere, Cogsworth and Beast.<br/><br/>The film has faced many people before release claiming it to be a pointless remake however, when they do as good a job as they do with this film then I fail to see where they are coming from. Bill Condon has made a film that clearly respects the animated version while adding new elements that don't do the film any harm at all. This is a very fun film as well, thanks to some high energy musical numbers, Gaston and Be Our Guest being my personal favourites, while I'm very glad to say the John Legend and Ariana Grande version of Beauty and the Beast does not accompany one of the film's most important moments, instead being rightfully sung by Mrs. Potts.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Beauty and the Beast features a cast that all deliver commendable performances in both acting and singing departments. Emma Watson makes for a very good Belle, even if her over pronunciation of words does continue to irritate me and her singing really did take me by surprise. I was a bit skeptical to start with but as the film progressed, I felt more comfortable listening to her sing. Dan Stevens and Luke Evans can sing pretty damn well too, Evans doing it with suitable amounts of arrogance as Gaston. The real star of the show though is Ewan McGregor as Lumiere, who steals the show with a brilliant vocal performance that includes a brilliant rendition of Be Our Guest.<br/><br/>So Beauty and the Beast is a very good time at the cinema that takes its place just behind The Jungle Book when it comes to the best live action Disney remakes. Oh, and the gay moment that was made into a big deal prior to its release, is nothing but a mountain out of a molehill. Bring on The Lion King and Mulan."
"khanz-35314","10","3","12","18 March 2017"," Wow
","Omg!! This film is amazing!!! So underrated it's the best Disney film since years!!! Belle is such a young empowering woman and the beast tells us to never judge anyone by looks. But the film is so visually stunning, and even though I'm a massive Marvel fan, ""Logan"" was great but ""Beauty and the Beast"" is just so unique, charming and so cute!!! I adore the character LeFou being gay because it can boost self-esteem for the LGBT community and the fact he kissed Gaston?? Wow. I really enjoyed the film!! I mean I would give it 10 but the CGI sort of ruins it. It was rather weak. I can't wait for more live-action Disney films because this is the best film after the Sheshawnk Redemption."
"gingr_rogrs","8","3","12","17 March 2017"," Beautiful and not beastly!
","Those of us 'of a certain age' will remember the original animation of Beauty and the Beast, either because we were children, or, as in my case, had a child who watched it on repeat on Video. So to say I am very familiar with the original Disney Animation is an understatement.<br/><br/>Imagine my dismay at the thought of a REAL PERSON attempting to become Gaston. I mean nearly any 'starlet' today could do a passable Belle, but Gaston, no this guy had to be something special, because Gaston is the driving force of the film; Gaston is the Donald Trump of Disney. Now I may sound biased (Luke Evans is Welsh) by saying that after seeing the film, I really can't imagine anyone else playing that part, and I'm unfamiliar with Josh Gadd, but he made a perfect foil to Evans' bull headed, misogynistic oaf by being subtly gay, gay enough to get banned in Russia, but subtle enough to make their friendship plausible. Evans really is something to behold, handsome yet despicable, he oozes sex appeal yet still managed to make me frown with disgust. In fact I would be so bold as to say the casting in this film is spot on. Emma Watson is quite delightful as Belle, nor once did she ram feminism down our throats, and her singing voice was sweetlyokay. She was in fact perfect as Belle, sweet and not OVER Feisty, but gave a real-feel to her character as a woman who had the choice of never marrying or ending up as the probable punch-bag of the village idiot. Dan Stevens, who I assume was Mo-capped, gave depth to the Beast, despite his face being covered in hair (how dare he! And... OMG that face Isn't real?) Could also sing. Kevin Kline played her dad with a wistful longing and Ewan McGregor and Sir Ian McKellan made a good double act as Lumiere and Cogsworth. (Dame) Emma Thompson was of course perfect (as she is perfect in everything), and special Kudos to Stanley Tucci for being his usual over the top magnificent self. The visuals are really quite lovely and contrary to a lot of reviews I've read, the Beast's face wasn't fuzzy (no pun intended) and did not detract OR distract from my enjoyment of the film - In fact I have no idea why people are saying that! He's supposed to be a Beast, therefore he would have a fuzzy hairy face. The REAL star of this film is of course the songs. All of the original Howard Elliot Ashman and Alan Menken tunes are included, with 2 new tunes with Lyrics by Tim Rice. And what crowd pleasing rip snorting songs they are too. Not once did I yawn with boredom or wish they'd hurry up and finish, nope, in fact I sang. Out loud (luckily it was very loud in the cinema and the other 20 old women in there - with husbands – I'd like to think they were singing too). The set piece for 'Gaston' (with original longer and more 'adult' lyrics by Menken is a rollicking ride I defy anyone not to want to stamp their feet too, and the centerpiece of 'Beauty and the Beast' as the couple finally dance together in the ballroom is everything I wanted it to be. Thompson's Mrs Potts wobbly voice singing the most romantic of lyrics. I admit a may have got something in my eye as Beast Twirled Belle in her yellow gown across the floor. Sigh. Now I've read several reviews of B&TB on IMDb, mainly from American cinema goers, who have resoundingly slated it. The consensus is that it's boring and not a patch on the original. Personally I was a little worried that it would be, like the other Disney live-actions, too 'right on' a bit too 'different' from the original and also include a load of overt feminist doctrine that has a place of course, but maybe not to prove a point. While the feminism in this film IS there and is subtle ('why are you teaching that girl to read? Isn't one enough' and the fact that Gaston can't believe Belle doesn't want him, mm perhaps that's sexist in itself?) it could have been a very different film. What Disney have finally done is, get it completely right. Because all they've done is tweak is slightly. It is a near carbon copy of a much loved film. So why bother making it again? A good question, one I have only one answer for and that of course, is money. I'm certainly not complaining, even the end credits are beautiful. I would have been more than happy to have popped to the loo, sat back down and re-watched the whole magical wonderful film again. Okay I'll tell you a secret. In my heart I am Belle, Snow White, Aurora, Cinderella, Mowgli and even Dumbo. THAT is the secret of Disney Films, because most little girls and some boys and lots of transgender people want to be a Princess, and be loved. So for all the people on IMDb who hate this film NER to you. The world we live in at the moment, I'll take some fairy tale magic romance any day!! Tale as old as time Song as old as rhyme Beauty and the beast.<br/><br/>PS I cried at the end."

","I am a fan of 1991 version but have to agree that this live action Beauty and the Beast is amazing. The CGI and visual effects are so good. Emma brought out a dreamy yet intelligent, fearless Belle. Dan Stevens did a very decent job with the Beast. They made the Beast with CGI but leave his eyes. So we have the Beast with human - and - so - emotional eyes which we hardly have in 1991 version.<br/><br/>I totally in love with this movie.

"sarahmartindale","Null","2","7","21 October 2017"," Disappointing and Forgettable
","I was looking very much forward to what they would do with this movie because I enjoyed the original so much and I wanted to see it brought to life with the CGI available today. I ended up pretty disappointed with the movie. It IS pretty beautiful, but not as spectacular as I had hoped.<br/><br/>The first scene (the opening narration) was pretty good, but once we got to the village with Belle, I just felt like something was off. The set looked like just that: a set. I couldn't get into the movie because it looked like a fantastically made theater set but NOT like a real place. I don't remember having the same problem with the sets in the castle, but because the village scene really set the mood for the rest of the movie, it really sticks out in my mind.<br/><br/>I agree with those who think Emma Watson was not a good choice. I don't have anything against her and rather enjoyed watching her in the Harry Potter movies, and in my opinion she LOOKS the part quite well, but I started having doubts about her when all the promotional materials came out because she just seemed so cold and expressionless compared with the cartoon version. I thought certainly there would be more range of emotion in live action, but I just didn't see it. She never seemed very angry, nor very happy, nor very surprised... just very bland. If I hadn't had the original Belle to compare her to, I think I would've found her to be not very likable at all.<br/><br/>The various servants of the castle are one of the most memorable parts of the cartoon movie. They are highly expressive in their movements and ""facial"" expressions. I get that it is MUCH more difficult to do that in a live action film because they have to look like they could be real objects -- too much expressiveness could easily wind up looking too cartoonish. But it turned out to be a shame for this movie because it was too hard to engage with so many of the characters.<br/><br/>I agree with those who found Luke Evans as Gaston to be the best part of the show acting wise, though the writing of the character was, again, better in the original because it starts with Gaston as an amusingly arrogant boor - nothing more - and then he slips into a true ""evil villain"" at the end. Here, Gaston seems more aggressive from the beginning.<br/><br/>The songs that I remember so well from the original movie were lackluster here. I didn't think they were terrible, but they were not nearly as ""fun"" in this one.<br/><br/>All in all, I am glad I didn't see this one in the theater. I might watch it again a time or two, at least while it remains on Netflix, but I don't see myself making any extra effort to see it again otherwise."
"dylanuse","3","2","7","26 September 2017"," Decent, Not great by any means
","As a fan of the original by Disney in the 1990's, I was optimistic at best about this ""remake"". However upon watching this...film, I can honestly say I expected better. Beauty and the Beast (animated) is consider by some to be one of Disney's best; not surprising due to it being nominated for best picture back in the day. Contrarily to other opinions, I would say that the casting choice for all characters was indeed sound. Afterall, even a bad actor can be decent with good writing. This film, did not have that luxury. It travels on the coattails of the original as an anchor. It is at best a hollow shell of the original devoid of intelligence and plot. Without too much detail, I would say some characters now steal the show with gimmicks, and the grandness of the world of the original is lost. The movie runs like a stage play, which if any movie fan knows: MOVIES are NOT PLAYS. Concerning writing, I think Emma Watson spends too much time playing ""social justice warrior"" instead of Belle. While not bad in general, too much of the ""plot"" is taken up by her antics taking away from much needed character development of both the household and the beast. DO NOT get me started on the Beast. He's supposed to be a bratty kid. He doesn't need ""ladies man lessons"" if he already was one before he was cursed (seen in trailer)!!! The ""gay"" concerns aside, It was a bit played up as well honestly. Not all LGBTQ+ men are flaming, dress wearing, makeup using guys. And yes, there was A LOT of them. I will spare you about my problems with Lefou in that regard (regarding that controversy so widespread, you've obviously heard it before). If this had been shown in place of the animated film years ago, it would have never gone down as the timeless classic we know today."
"sbohdan","3","2","7","12 September 2017"," How to ruin a great story
","Judging from the clothes wear-ed in the movie, this is a XVIII century story, that is set in France, yet it is full of blacks and Asians, giving the false sense of always existing multiculturalism in Europe. This is a lie and it targets children, which makes it even more disgusting. Did I even mention LeFou who is an outright faggot?! In a children's story! The only reason I don't give this garbage of a movie a 1 score is the CGI, the beautiful costumes and the scenery."
"pnck71","8","2","7","6 May 2017"," Not that bad actually
","I know, Disney producers should be ashamed of themselves for making yet another remake instead of picking something more original. I entirely agree with that. But, history aside, I'd say the film itself is actually pretty good. OK, I was actually one of those boyfriends that were dragged along to watch it, so my expectations were pretty low. But still. The cinematography is spectacular. And Emma Whatson is entirely convincing and enjoyable as Belle. So the film did not break any new grounds, but if you want something feel-good for Friday night, then you might actually enjoy it. (Although I don't understand why every single movie must include LGBT these days (with all due respect to the community). It's a fairy tale, for god's sake.)"

","Disney continues to knock home-runs out of the park with their plan of re-imagining their animated classics and this time they have done so again with ""Beauty and the Beast"".<br/><br/>Headed by the beauty herself, Emma Watson, the film has a star-studded cast of rising stars and legends of Hollywood. The entire cast does such a phenomenal job at each of their own respective characters. Making the audience fall in love with virtually every character on screen.

From the visuals of the live environment surrounding the castle or village to the animation involved in the music numbers. Everything was quite beautiful.<br/><br/>My only gripe with any form of animation was with Beast. There has been criticism about his animation which I can half agree with. In some scenes, he was great and his animation wasn't distracting but in other scenes, his movement was choppy and evidently off.<br/><br/>Ultimately, ""Beauty and the Beast"" was a great live-action film. Disney continues to work its magic re-imagining their classics and continues to work their fool-proof formula.<br/><br/>-- Oberrated.com --"
"envity1981","6","2","7","1 April 2017"," The end was too politically correct
","Most critics have already written what I think about this movie. I can only agree with many negative reviews here. But one thing has not been mentioned very clearly. This movie feels like the producers trying to shove their political views down my throat.<br/><br/>It's okay to have LeFou acted a little gay. Most children would not understand small allusions to LeFou's homosexuality. But having him danced with another man is too obvious. And making him change the sides is a bit unrealistic. If I were he with a ""broken"" heart after Gaston abandoned him, I would have just left the scene instead of fighting with the ""good guys"". Perhaps Disney wants to make us believe that homosexuals are actually misunderstood, and that they belong to the good guys. But let's be honest. The original LeFou is not a fighter. He's just a ridiculous butt kisser who we can laugh about. That's all, and nothing more.<br/><br/>Another obvious PC point: One racially mixed couple is surely nice and okay but why does it have to be 2 mixed couples? How many black people lived in France back in those days?<br/><br/>The point of the ending is too obvious. Disney wants to teach us that it's perfectly normal to fall in love with someone of the same sex, or of a different race. I get it but it's annoying, and feels like a brain-wash.<br/><br/>Please, make the next live action Disney movie less politically correct. Not all people around the world agree with your political views. Or at least, don't make it too obvious.<br/><br/>Perhaps Russia did the right thing by restricting the age of viewers for this movie. It's not a kids' movie anymore. It's rather propaganda."
"left_us_silent","9","2","7","30 March 2017"," Why all the hate? I loved it!
","Wow, I am so shocked by all the people on here hating on this movie. I thought it was fantastic, a wonderful adaptation of the original animated version. I am a huge fan of all the Disney classics, Beauty and Beast being my absolute favorite. My VHS copy when I was a kid, practically had a hole burnt through it from the amount of times I watched it. I of course was hesitant about this remake, particularly after the deluge of Disney remake failures that have disgraced us with their presence over the past number of years. But Beauty and the Beast surpassed all my expectations. I've now seen it twice in theater!<br/><br/>The songs were all perfectly done, I found myself signing (quietly) to them all, and the nostalgia brought on a number of tears I must admit. There were a number of new songs that I didn't really care for, but it tied the story together well, so I can appreciate them for what they were. <br/><br/>Emma Watson was a wonderful Belle. She had the perfect description for her, and played the part really well. She's not going to win any Grammys for her singing, but she did a pretty good job, and should be commended for this. <br/><br/>Luke Evans was definitely the highlight of the movie playing Gaston. My goodness, what an absolutely perfect choice for this part. I could not get enough of him! His arrogance and vanity, his voice and those strong strong egotistical facial expressions. It was like the animated Gaston had been pulled straight out of the screen and turned into the real life version. Josh Gad also did an absolutely wonderful job as LeFou! Him and Luke Evans made the perfect team. <br/><br/>Shout out also to the CGI team who did a great job with all the talking antiques in the castle. Great choice of actors to play the voices behind them too. The ""Be Our Guest"" number (a personal favourite from the original) was simply marvelous. What a visual delight! <br/><br/>Negatives: There were a few corny moments throughout the film that added some cringe factor, a few extra little stories lines and aspects that weren't from the original and a few scenes that could have done with a little more depth. But in the end, this was not enough to change my overall opinion of the film. <br/><br/>Just go see this movie and let the nostalgia wash over you. It's not the original, but it does a hell of a good job as the remake."
"msecaur","9","2","7","29 March 2017"," A Beauty of a Film, Magical From Start to Finish!
","I was born a few years too late to enjoy the so-called ""Disney renaissance"" films from the late 80's and early 90's anywhere but on home video, but they played an important part in my childhood and remain beloved favorites, particularly ""Beauty and the Beast."" At any age, I could appreciate the top-notch, often cinematic animation; the witty and rousing music; the excellent voice cast; and the timeless, moving and almost operatic story.<br/><br/>Yet as near-perfect a film as it was, I recognized where it could be improved; mainly the spare 84-minute runtime, which precluded giving sufficient backstory for the main characters, as well as the development of Belle and the Beast's relationship beyond a mere scene or two. It was also clear that animation, as limitless as the medium can be, was constraining to a story with such scope and detail. Needless to say, I was extremely excited about this live-action remake, and am pleased to say my excitement was entirely justified.<br/><br/>Comparisons between this film and its predecessor are inevitable and just a nature of the beast (pun intended). Is it a cut-and-paste carbon copy of the original? No, and nor should it be. But it isn't a reimagination, either. In one sentence, it's the same film told in a new medium, touched up very gently with influences from the whole history of the Beauty and the Beast story. While staying true to the original film, the small enhancements make this film something fresh and vibrant that fans, both old and new, can enjoy.<br/><br/>The main improvement is the generous 129-minute runtime, which allows time for exploring the backstories of Belle and the Beast, their burgeoning relationship (which here grows out of a mutual love of literature and is given the extra screen-time that it deserves), and the furthering of the development of just about every character, elements that were either missing completely or glossed over in the original film. Rather than slowing this film down, they help add another dimension to the characters and overall story and make it a more satisfying experience.<br/><br/>The Brits lead the pack when it comes to fine acting, and the decision made on this film to have a nearly all-British cast could not have been better. Emma Watson is perfect as the bookish, determined Belle, and while her soprano is more pop-sounding than that of Paige O'Hara, I couldn't picture anyone else but her in the role. Dan Stevens brings a dry wit to his haunted yet equally bookish Beast, while his melancholy baritone and piercing blue eyes recall Robby Benson's Beast from the original film. The chemistry between them is palpable, and provides the beating heart necessary to carry off a story as romantic as this. While it is hard to match the passion and anguish of Glen Keane's animated Beast, the double motion-capture technology employed to bring Stevens' performance to life is a worthy effort.<br/><br/>Luke Evans is an excellent Gaston, equal parts panache and sadism, with a soaring heroic tenor and a handsome physique that disguises the character's cruel heart within. The supporting cast of luminaries like Emma Thompson, Ewan McGregor, Ian McKellen, Audra McDonald, Kevin Kline, Stanley Tucci, and Josh Gad are excellent in their own ways, and bring fresh outlooks on the beloved characters without straying too far from their animated counterparts.<br/><br/>Alan Menken's expanded and revised score is beautiful and thrilling, and the new songs written with Tim Rice, while not quite up to the level of his collaborations with Howard Ashman, work well in their places in the film. My particular favorite is ""Evermore,"" sung by the Beast in the final act. A haunting, Phantom-esque ballad, it gives expression to the Beast's realization that he has come to love Belle, even as he willingly lets her go. The original songs are freshened up with unused lyrics by Howard Ashman, and sound great when sung by this wonderful cast.<br/><br/>Visually, the film is a Gothic-Rococo masterpiece, with sumptuous set-pieces and staging that would not be out of place in a golden-age Hollywood musical. The costumes, while more period-appropriate than the original, pay homage to the original, and strike the perfect balance between fantasy and reality. While the animated film is in some ways more striking, the fact that almost all of what is seen on screen was created as a physical set and not later in CGI is quite astonishing.<br/><br/>All together, ""Beauty and the Beast"" was everything I expected it to be and more. It moved me to both laughter and tears, and as I left the theatre I found myself wanting to see it again. What better recommendation is there than that? <br/><br/>For those who question this film's very existence, I have a very simple answer: The message contained in ""Beauty and the Beast"" to look beyond appearances to see the goodness within has captivated humanity for thousands of years, and should have expression in some medium for every generation to enjoy and learn from. We've been blessed in the past thirty years to have three masterworks: Andrew Lloyd Webber's ""The Phantom of the Opera,"" Disney's original ""Beauty and the Beast,"" and this glorious live-action remake. While it's not a perfect film, if you can stop quibbling over superficial details and instead consider how well it delivers this core idea, than it is nothing short of a triumph."

This was a big piece of my childhood and after making the mistake of glancing at some reviews on IMDb, I was a little worried the film was going to be one big disappointment.<br/><br/>Fortunately I was not disappointed.<br/><br/>Firstly, Emma Watson was stunning as Belle. <br/><br/>She isn't going to win a Grammy Award and won't be belting out a power ballad any time soon, but her voice had a softness about it that just worked. Dan Stevens' signing voice was just as good as were the rest of the supporting cast. The old songs were as good and the new songs didn't feel out of place.<br/><br/>Luke Evans was brilliant and his portrayal as Gaston as to be one of the best of any characters in a Disney film. Both Gaston and LeFou are more developed and evoke more emotion from the audience than the respective characters in the animated film.<br/><br/>The only criticism I can make is that the connection between Belle and the Beast did on one or two occasions feel a little forced. The best way I explain it is to say that this was a result of the film trying too hard to literally reenact scenes from the animated film rather than telling the same story in its own way.<br/><br/>These scenes were very few and far between however, and the Dance Scene more than made up for any shortcomings elsewhere.<br/><br/>Belle and the Beast walking down the stairs to meet each other just as ""Tale as Old as Time"" started to play was a spine-tingling moment. Emma Watson and Dan Stevens gave this life that just isn't possible from an animated film, no matter how brilliant it is.<br/><br/>I have read a lot criticism around the CGI, in particular the Beast. It is entirely possible I am not as observant as some other people but I just didn't see it, at least not to detract from my enjoyment of the film. I did see the film in 2D, it is possible it's more noticeable in 3D.<br/><br/>If you love the animated film, make sure you watch Beauty and the Beast. If you didn't, still make sure you watch it."
"austin0731","6","2","7","28 March 2017"," A genuine rendition of a Disney classic
","This is quite a brilliant adaptation of the original beauty and the beast, it does not try and be something that it isn't or try to be anything more than just what it is. It was a solid, genuine and enjoyable film. As the theme song dubs, it is ""A tale as old as time"" so really what is there to change or add to? It's a classic. But what elevates this over the original animated version in my opinion is its stylistic choices and its musical pieces.<br/><br/>The visuals in this film was breathtaking, from the set design to costume to the music really just paints a very Gothic and glamorous 'oil painting' of a scene and I loved this element of the film. The household objects voiced by the likes of 'Ian McKellen' were very good. However the most notable performance likely came from Luke Evans as Gaston, very much like his character in the original animated film he really just stole every scene that he was in. <br/><br/>One element that must be done right is the relationship between the beast and Belle. Emma Watson is of course very resembling of Belle so that is a plus on that part. I think that Emma Watson does a decent job at selling the relationship between Belle and the beast and there is genuine sympathy towards the beast, however I feel that her acting does trip up a little particularly towards the end and this does take a little bit off of the film as a whole. <br/><br/>But otherwise it is a great adaptation of the original, I enjoyed the music and it is a great time so long as you can accept that this film does live in the shadows of its predecessor and you shouldn't come in accepting more than it promises because, it really is just a beautiful and solid rendition of a classic tale."
"jasmineporter12","9","2","7","27 March 2017"," Way better than I expected!
","This was an amazing movie. Of course everyone has heard of Beauty and the Beast. I didn't remember much of the story; I was a young girl when I first saw the movie and other fairy tales like it. Then after becoming older, I grew out of fairy tales. Although I knew the gist of Beauty and the Beast, I did not know everything that would eventually unfold in the plot. It makes me want to get reacquainted with all of the popular fairy tales. I really enjoyed this film a lot. Emma Watson was fantastic and so stunning! The music was overwhelmingly spectacular! I will check out this soundtrack for sure! ""Belle"" and ""Belle (REPRISE)"" were great. I'm not too familiar with the music of Beauty and the Beast, except for its title track. It was lovely to hear versions of songs that I'm sure I heard when I was little. My only criticism of the film is that I felt that they spent a ton of time building up to the meeting between Belle and the Beast, that it feels a little rushed when they actually start getting friendlier with each other, spending time together, reading books together. I felt that the transitioning in the middle was a little too quick and all of a sudden, they are in love with each other. But other than that, 9 OUT OF 10! I would definitely recommend this film. It's not just entertainment for young people. This is a classic fairy tale and people of all ages should see this."
"stephyb-12714","7","2","7","27 March 2017"," Beautiful Adaptation
","After overcoming the fear that they were set to ruin another Disney classic by what I branded then as an 'unnecessary' live adaptation, I eventually gave it a watch. Once you get over Emma Watson's blatant auto-tune, I do not think anyone can really fault this film.<br/><br/>The costume, the CGI, the singing of both classic and original songs were spectacular - proving there really is no one quite like Gaston! Luke Evans' portrayal gives you the perfect balance of hatred for the character, but unlike the animation, makes you watch with admiration and love for his witty, self obsessed ways. Just like the arguably new take on LeFou, you really do fall for Gaston! Josh Gad's performance provides comic relief, almost with a similar effect any 'homosexual' character would have in 20th Century cinema but to leave it at that would be unfair. In comparison to the animation, the writers have definitely upped the homo-erotic chemistry between LeFou and Gaston but I thoroughly believe that they have only drawn that from the blatant admiration LeFou shows Gaston in the original. Just from among friends, relatives and the controversial news coverage, it was clear that to have an 'openly gay' character in a children's movie is unfortunately still classed as a 'brave' decision. The comments and actions provided by LeFou are very well timed and executed in a way that is light-hearted and free from conservative restraint, shown with a surrounding acceptance in the final dance scene. For me, having two men dance with each other should not be viewed any different to Belle and the Prince dancing and the Director seemingly had the same thought. It is done with some ease, the camera briefly settling on the actors to show an exchange of relieved, unreserved smiles when they embrace for a dance, simply putting them in the norm - as they should be.<br/><br/>From breath-taking dancing, to singing. Emma Thompson does well to make 'Tale as Old as Time' a stunning blend of old and new, her voice definitely reflecting the beauty of Angela Lansbury's heart wrenching vocals in the original. Every singing cast member did well, even Ewan McGregor with his questionable French accent. Well, everyone except Emma Watson. Although her acting was strong, her vocals weren't up to standard. She seemed to have had the inability to hold any long lasting notes, causing songs like 'Something There' to lose its effect.<br/><br/>Another worthy note is that the film did well to flesh out characters a bit more, the story of Belle's mother adding more depth to her relationship with her father, Maurice. The Beasts' upbringing is more subtly mentioned, but shows something that the original leaves out.<br/><br/>Overall, it is a visually stunning mix of new and old. Even knowing the story line like the back of my hand, it still managed to evoke tears and laughter at the very same point. Nostalgic to us, or new to the younger audience, it was brilliant."

","Yeah this movie didn't need to be made but Disney doesn't care. They're gonna do as many live action movies as they can and we can't stop them. <br/><br/>You know the plot.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'll list the things I didn't like because I liked more things: 1. Emma Watson's singing voice. It was weak and lacked passion. 2. The 'gay' moment. It was small and not gay enough. Le Fou, a notable buffoon, gay? Kind of silly. Disney should spend their time making original characters who are gay. 3. They didn't include the song 'Home' from the Broadway show. This would have been okay if they didn't include the music for that song. <br/><br/>I loved a lot of things. I loved the movie. I was really surprised considering the live action Cinderella was kind of dumb. <br/><br/>Things I LOVED: 1. The song 'Evermore' 2. How they explained Belle's mother absence (both the explanation and the scene). 3. Josh Gad 4. The added characteristics for Belle and the Beast.<br/><br/>I liked everything else. <br/><br/>So before you bash this movie because Disney's greed to make more money, watch it."
"felix-wyderka","8","2","7","26 March 2017"," An enjoyable and heartwarming family movie with a great soundtrack
","""Beauty and the Beast"" is another proof that Disney can make heartwarming and entertaining Live-Action movies. Lets start by saying a few words about the acting and characters. Emma Watson, despite a shaky start, shows off her acting skills and not only that but she also proves that she is a quite good singer. Kevin Kline shows off his skills as well and makes a rather serious role enjoyable and quirky. The most enjoyable part of the whole movie are the voices of the castle's staff. Ewan McGreggor, Emma Thomson and Ian McKellen have such a great chemistry just with their voices and it just feels natural for them to be like this. All the singing performances of all actors are just amazing and heartwarming. Furthermore I must say that all the casting decisions made here were spot on. The costumes are marvelous and perfectly reflect the characteristics of each single character, may it be the joy and cleverness of Belle or the sadness of her father. Moving on to cinematography we can say that there are many great extreme long shots of the castle, forest or simply the village that make the viewer want to jump into the screen and spent time in this magic land. Often the camera expresses the feelings of all characters very well. One more thing that should be mentioned is that the whole set and all the props are just beautiful and make the village appear so welcoming and at home. This movie makes the viewer feel welcome and at home in every way and I just did not want it to end because it was so entertaining. While there is many great things to say about this movie there are also some minor criticisms. First, Belle just seems so small and unremarkable in the whole setting of the castle. Another thing that bothered me was that in some scenes the lighting was off and it appeared a bit dark. A rather minor thing was Evan's acting appeared a little wooden throughout the movie but luckily it was well compensated by Josh Gad's funny and quirky performance. In conclusion we can say that ""Beauty and the Beast"" is a very well made movie with an outstanding soundtrack and great acting performances as well as some great shots of scenery. At the end I can say that Disney outdid themselves once more and I hope that whatever movie they decide to make Live-Action next will be as good as this one."

Not a fan of the bombastic show tunes that musicals tend to nowadays, but I could live with it. Biggest surprise is what a great singing voice Luke Evans has. Get that man into a musical soon.

","If you loved the animated original as a child, you will be utterly delighted by the live- action version, which, while adding depth to the central themes and complexity to the characters and story, still remains remarkably winsome and charming. The extra forty minutes are used deftly, adding richness and detail only when needed, and expanding only where the original film simply did not have time enough to do. The love story is deepened beautifully, compelling and believable enough to satisfy adult audiences without drifting from the sweetness and simplicity the original. Inevitably, there are moments where the movie falls short and you may judge for yourself where those moments occur -- but even where it disappoints, it only reminds us of the perfection of the iconic film that inspired it. It is, above all, a respectful, endlessly enjoyable celebration of the classic."

","The movie ""Beauty and The Beast"" 2017 version is compact with what I have been expected so far. I had imagined the beautiful actress, the 3D images, the new songs, and the original plot. Yes, Disney gives all of it! Thank you :) The first I want to review is about the title. Disney kept the original title ""Beauty and the Beast"" or ""La Belle et La Bete"" en francais, not like other fairy tales movies, for example Huntsman, Red Riding Hood, or others. Disney keep the title, so that everybody can already guess the ending. The plot of this movie is easy to guess, but the special one with this newest version is that about ""French"" style, by decoration, some words, wardrobe, songs, and ambiance of the villages. All is so-French and I love it. I appreciate Emma Watson who can change character from the witch in Harry Potter, to the ordinary village girl who is awkward and book-warm, even though there is a witch also in this movie. I suggest this movie is watched by your children, so you can teach them about morality, the important of being humble, and the appreciation of all materials that you have now, can be cursed by the beautiful witch :) Super bravo, c'est un bon film! :)"
"xgray-03873","8","2","7","22 March 2017"," I Actually Thought This Was A Pretty Good Movie Remake.
","Honestly, there isn't much to compare the live-action 2017 Disney remake to the 1991 animated version at all. But, I will say this, it actually does feel more like a live-action Broadway Musical, than it does as a ""shot-for-shot/note-for-note translation of the original"" unlike Batman: The Killing Joke (2016), Psycho (1999), and the 2014 remake of RoboCop. Now, with the characters, well..not much has changed. I mean, it's exactly as it was in the 1991 version, but we're basically given more backstories on Belle and the Beast's parents, and their pasts, respectively. As well as some more interactions between the servants, Gaston and LeFou. Story-wise, pretty much the same. But, the musical score and the songs are amazing. My only gripes are, yes, the Beast's design shouldn't have been all CGI, but rather, just practical effects, puppetry and make- up. And Belle's iconic princess dress in the movie...still needs more volume and honestly, they should've included the glove. And lastly, I don't get what was the big deal about announcing that LeFou was gay in the movie. Who cares?! I still thought he was funny and the actor did a good job portraying the character.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm not saying that the 2017 remake is ""better"" than the original, not because of nostalgia, but because it actually does feel more another remake to a totally incarnation of the original 1991 version aka..the Broadway musical adaptation. But, if you're looking for something to appeal to your 1990's nostalgia, then go watch the original 1991 version. You're not really missing out on much and it's still a timeless classic. the 2017 remake is just another version that will have it's own growing fan-base, for the time being.<br/><br/>But, through it all...I actually had fun watching this movie.<br/><br/>8 out of 10."

","Okay, seriously, I was expecting to really not like this, but I was smiling the whole way through. It was reminiscent of the original film, but added so much more in the way of backstory, and the new music was perfection. <br/><br/>I honestly don't understand why so many people are rating it badly. The original film is still the original and it will always be a classic! This version is thoroughly Disney and the music absolutely makes it. I felt like I was in the theatre watching a musical whilst in the cinema, the film had that feel about it, which I loved! <br/><br/>Yes, I probably wouldn't have picked Emma Watson as Belle, but the production design and score made up for that. Luke Evans, on the other hand, was phenomenal! Casting Josh Gad (already popular as Olaf) was a stroke of genius from Disney as well. <br/><br/>I also thought it was so much more emotional than the original, but then maybe that's just me?! The relationships between the characters were tremendous, and it was laugh out loud funny at times. Lumiere, Cogsworth, Mrs Potts etc were all wonderful, and the transformation scene was just as moving as the original (maybe more!). <br/><br/>Everyone should go see it even if they have doubts because of what everyone else has been saying. Make up your own mind! I'm so glad I opted to go see it and didn't listen to everyone else!"
"stilloopless1","8","2","7","21 March 2017"," Tale Still Wonderful as Time
","I'm not sure why there's so much haterade surrounding this film, but here's my take...<br/><br/>Following the awful mess that constituted the live action version of Cinderella in 2015, I've been anxious for Disney to redeem themselves. What better place to do so than with one of my favorite fairy tales. So, with fingers crossed, I took them up on their invitation to be their guest at Beauty and the Beast . Redemption is a beautiful thing as is this thoroughly enjoyable tale as old as time.<br/><br/>The casting is practically perfect.<br/><br/>Lucy Bevan put together an ultimate check list for casting and checked off every actor/character pairing to near perfection. While I personally don't think anyone can top Angela Lansbury as Mrs. Potts from the 1991 animated film, Emma Thompson is a very close second. Kevin Kline is shines as Maurice, less dotty and more three dimensional doting/loving father. Luke Evans brings the bombastic buffoonery Gaston to life and the pairing with Josh Gad's LeFou is sensational. LeFou is as devoted as ever, but more thoughtful and considerate as well. Sir Ian McKellen is great as Cogsworth and Ewan McGrogor's Lumiere is perfectly charming (I only wish these two and their friendly adversarial relationship were featured a bit more). Dan Haller's Beast roars onto the screen does the character justice. Emma Watson simple radiates as Belle and has that great mixture of warmth, heart, and tenacity the character embodies.<br/><br/>The music is as enjoyable as ever and has a new freshness with the addition of some new songs and scenes. Added backstory and additional story lines ground the film in reality and bring more depth and maturity, but there's still a nice balance of fantasy and magic. The familiarity and nostalgia of this film is everywhere, but this new version made me smile (and sing along). Kudos Disney, for getting back into fighting form with this one and bringing back some great memories while creating new ones.<br/><br/>I'm giving Beauty and the Beast a solid 8.5. But, don't take my word for it though, be a guest and see it for yourself. I recommend 3D if you can."

","I'm a 80s kid so I grew up with the original Beauty and the Beast, which means I also watched it hundreds of times. It was such an empowering movie for a young impressionable girl, because Belle was ""different"" and smart and loved to read, which was not something Hollywood liked to portray about girls or women.<br/><br/>Anyways, on to the live action BatB.. I absolutely loved it! I rarely go out and watch movies in the theater these days but I went and watched this one. I couldn't wait and I was pleasantly surprised. I went into this visual experience super excited and I definitely enjoyed myself thoroughly. As soon as the original opening BatB song started playing in the beginning, my heart was practically leaping out of my chest, I teared up and a wave of nostalgia took me back to my childhood. It was such a melancholy yet warming sensation. <br/><br/>The movie was fun, had a bit more backstory than the original cartoon version, was very well casted, had new surprises but mostly kept to all the original magic that I loved as a child and even now when I think about BatB. A beautiful display of cinematography leaves this one as a shining star that will be as loved as the classic.<br/><br/>Oh and about the gayness, it was so minor and silly, people shouldn't let that stop them from seeing this masterpiece.. trust me God won't strike you down!<br/><br/>**The Following May Contain Spoilers**<br/><br/>My faves.. The characters: As I stated above, this movie was very well casted IMO. Belle, well of course, it was the wonderful, smart Emma Watson and she was so refreshing. Her simple beauty and crisp voice really made her the perfect Belle. I loved how Belle was so strong and fierce in this movie. Gaston! Where do I begin.. Luke Evans is such a hunk, I always had the hots for him in any movie I watched with him in it.. well he certainly fit the bill for Gaston! Also, he can sing and his voice seemed perfect for the part. Lefou was another favorite of mine, played by Josh Gad. He was perfect and really paralleled the cartoon Lefou in a lot of ways. Lumiere is the last I'll gush about.. I was surprised that he was vocalized by Ewan McGregor but what a great job he did. <br/><br/>A few misses.. Not really the actors fault but no one can replace Angela Lansbury as Mrs. Potts, sorry.. she's the bomb and I like the old Cogsworth better but Ian McKellan gave it his best (still on the top with Magneto and Gandalf though!).<br/><br/>The ending was also really special. Of course I knew what was going to happen in the end, but when all the servants, i.e. household furniture, were being permanently turned into furniture, I cried. It was a really touching moment and I loved how they were all saying their good- byes, it was really sad (even though I knew the spell would be broken!).<br/><br/>Overall, I think it was the perfect live action version of the ""tale as old as time"". I couldn't have left happier and filled with peace than after I watched this movie."

I was actually scared at first that the Beast would look silly (had not seen trailers), but when finally seeing him, loved what they had done. I did not expect the movie to stay so true to the original toon, while also helping understand some potential plot holes from the original (in a way that makes perfect sense). Overall, loved it.

However, the most daring component of BEAST is ripped from Today's Headlines. Disney goes out on the limb of risking a charge of political incorrectness by suggesting that not all Gay Guys are Good. Tinseltown has toed this party line for decades, with Laurel & Hardy, Abbott & Costello, Stanley & Livingston, the Lone Ranger & Tonto, right through to Butch & Sundance. However, the Gay Blade Gaston is clearly the Real Villain of BEAST, as even his Bi- Belly-Hickeyed Paramour LeFou comes to realize. Not only that, but Disney makes it Crystal Clear to even America's toddlers that Gaston's pursuit of Belle to become his ""beard"" (or ""trophy wife"") is a perfect parallel to Don Juan Trump's exploitation of U.S. Third Lady Melania. About 96 minutes into this film Disney puts Trump's most notable Campaign Catch-Phrase (""Lock Her Up!!"") into Gaston's mouth (referencing Belle), and turns the gullible villagers into a crazed mob indistinguishable from a Red State Trump Rally."

","""Beauty And The Beast"" is Disney's fourth live-action remake of a classic animated film, is directed by Bill Condon, and star Emma Watson as Belle, a bookworm who goes a castle holding a beast who has been coursed and they start to fall in love with each while Gaston (Luke Evans) has other plans. <br/><br/>I was really looking forward to this film after seeing ""The Jungle Book,"" and seeing how well Disney pulled off that magic, and thankfully it worked in this film. Not as good as the animated classic, but a very strong-live action remake.<br/><br/>Emma Watson does a very good job as Belle. I can see this as a career revival for Emma. Looking at her films between Harry Potter and this, I think a lot of people didn't really know where her acting career was going. And goddamn can she sing. Her voice is magnificent. Who knew she could belt those high notes. A movie like this has to have good chemistry from its two leads. if it doesn't, this movie would have failed, but luckily, she and Dan Stevens make a great team and their chemistry together is really realized in a lot of the bonding scenes in this film.<br/><br/>Let's talk about Luke Evans as Gaston for a moment. Luke Evans proves why he is one of the best actors working today. Gaston was villainous, he was evil, downright unlikeable, like a classic Disney villain or any movie villain for that matter should be, and it really helped that he was portrayed by someone like Luke Evans. Evans gives it his all and the supporting cast does as well, as not one single one of them has a bad singing voice.<br/><br/>Some of the songs were extended, which I liked. The ""Gaston"" song was extended for this movie to show just how evil the dude really is, and I appreciated that. All of the classics from the original animated film are in here like ""Belle,"" ""Be Our Guest,"" ""Beauty And The Beast,"" ""Gaston,"" and ""Kill the Beast."" My only problem with so many songs and an added 40 minutes on the runtime compared to the original is that at times it feels like this film can be a bit slow. You feel like you're a lot further into this film than you really are and you realize that sometimes a couple of the songs drag. <br/><br/>There also some times that the CGI with the Beast bothered me. It didn't look very smooth in these scenes when it was mostly flawless for the rest of the film. I've talked to other people about this and they say they didn't notice it, but for some reason I did, and it stuck out so I had to talk about a technical flaw I saw.<br/><br/>This vision is well realized. The world this film portrays portrays it in a way that is believable. You believe this place actually exists and is fantasy world that people like Belle could live in. I really liked this movie, and am looking forward to many more Disney live-action remakes.<br/><br/>I am going to give ""Beauty And The Beast"" an 8.5/10.<br/><br/>You can find my video review of ""Beauty And The Beast"" on YouTube here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMtb_uXG9c4"

","OMG this movie is so AMAZING!! Well because I'm a big fan of BATB movie (animated one), so I have a big expectation to this movie. And the result? Yes I am very satisfied! Well from the beginning to the ending, I just can't stop smiling while watching the movie. It just happened! Of course some part made me tear my eyes. The movie is above my expectation. I love the song, the stories, the actor/actress and everything!! Even I have a plan to watch it again.<br/><br/>And don't be bothered by people who just hate it and give ""1"" score. Watch it and you will know! Good job Bill Condon !"
"AverieWatson","7","3","14","17 March 2017"," Good overall, but something seems a bit off
","As far as Disney's live action remakes go, I'd honestly have to say that this is my favourite one so far. I went into the cinema with pretty low expectations - I remembered how the 2015 remake of Cinderella had played out: it was an okay film, but it was just okay, and it didn't really do the original animated film much justice. That was what I was expecting with Beauty and the Beast.<br/><br/>It turned out a lot better than I thought it would. I really like how the Beast's character has been built up more in this version - they actually gave him a backstory, which was something that I had always felt was lacking in the original animated film. And a few plot holes from the original story are filled (i.e. how come nobody knows that there's a huge castle in the forest next to the village, why does nobody remember the prince, etc.). And the idea that the servants in the castle could have had family in the village was something that honestly never even occurred to me whilst watching the animated film. In the original movie, the Beast's castle just seems so displaced from the rest of the village, it is honestly very difficult to remember that it isn't that far away from Belle's hometown. That definitely is not the case in the remake.<br/><br/>However, something just seemed very... off. And when I got halfway through the movie, I realized what it was. I didn't feel like I was watching Emma Watson playing Belle. I felt like I was watching Emma Watson playing Emma Watson.<br/><br/>Perhaps it is just because I am so used to seeing her in roles similar to Hermione in Harry Potter, but even her performance in Noah reminded me of her portrayal of Belle here...<br/><br/>I would still recommend seeing this if you are a fan of the animated movie, or even if you're just a fan of the fairy-tale (or just fairy-tales in general). It is a very visually beautiful movie. But if you're expecting something that is completely true to the original film, you may leave disappointed. A few things have been added in - the basic plot stays the same, but it is not a perfect copy of the animated movie."

","I'm a huge Disney fan so my expectations were high. But they were shattered after the first 5 minutes. <br/><br/>Most of the cast can't sing. Emma Watson can't hold the tune. Compare it to the original movie, it's horrid. With Luke Evans it is the same. Watson is a miscast, she has nothing i common with Bele. But the producers went of course with the big names instead of proper singer for a musical. How silly of me to expect otherwise.

"audrablum","2","2","8","12 October 2017"," A Total Disn-aster
","Beauty and the Beast (2017) was a Disn-aster (Disney disaster). This live action remake of Beauty and The Beast (1991) felt nothing short of a Japanese live-action anime remake. The plot is pretty similar to the original, loosely based on the novel written by Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont (1756). Similar to the 1991 animated story, Belle and her father move to a town where they are considered outcasts by the locals. Belle's father heads out to an event, gets redirected to the Beast's lair and becomes his prisoner. Belle rescues her father by taking his place and for the next two hours we witness Stockholm syndrome. This film left me and many others Disneypointed (disappointed in Disney). This film made me think about how not to rush a story through production and consider the additional steps needed to insure a film could be pulled off well. There was in fact a team of screenwriters for this movie: Stephen Chbosky and Evan Spiliutopoulos. I feel that there strengths were that they made a film that got financed. I feel that there weaknesses were that there was not enough strength in the film to make it good enough to stand on its own. The script relied heavily on the fact that the audience saw the 1991 animated version and understood that this was just a re-telling of that story. The director was Bill Condon who previously directed the Twilight: Breaking Dawn film. His strengths in this film were that he could blend the visual effects with the real life film quite well. There was enough space in each composition to make room for the CGI components and nothing really felt visually contrived. His weakness was made apparent in casting and editing. Half of the cast was trained to ""sing"" with no real talent and made up for in post via auto- tune, or just left in the movie (Gaston went flat when he rallied the villagers. It was hard to miss). The film was edited by Virginia Katz, who had previously worked with Condon in Twilight: Breaking Dawn and in other previous films. The editing that seemed to work well was the composition of shots in the ""Be Our Guest"" scene. There was a lot of seamless movement in that scene and it was really quite impressive. The cinematographer for this movie was Tobias A. Shliessler, who worked with Condon previously on Dream Girls. To me the lighting on this film felt odd and misplaced at times, which made the castle feel like a fake set. I personally wish there was more contrast over the scenes like there was in the animated film. Overall, there is a lot that I would have done differently. I wouldn't have rushed production. As a director I would have utilized more close-ups and would have hung on the shots that mattered. I would have maybe written a little more in character back stories, without completely changing the characters. As a musically based piece, I would have cast actors who could sing and maybe carried similar mannerisms to the animated characters. I would have also cast actors who looked more like those characters and kept them true to their characters. I probably also would have played up the original film score to serve the film. This really had potential to be a better movie than it was and I am personally disappointed with the half- hearted effort put forth by one of the largest studios in the world."
"SaidNDone","3","2","8","5 October 2017"," Are they French or British? A film with no identity
","'Beauty & The Beast' makes its identity crisis clear from the beginning, when it opens with villagers singing about their French lives in British accents. Later in the scene, Gaston, a native Frenchman claims in English to not understand what ""je ne sais quoi"" means in a poorly thought out comic bit. This dissonance in character identity from the opening then becomes a pervasive theme throughout the movie. The nominally French setting is constantly undermined by the filmmakers' Anglophilia, a microcosm of 'Beauty & The Beast's' greater identity crisis.<br/><br/>In the second act, after Lumiere brags about fine French dining, he immediately breaks into grand finale explicitly alluding to British India (apparently aesthetically similar French held North Africa was never considered by the filmmakers). Belle and the Beast supposedly fall in love whilst admiring the French countryside.... to the sonnets of British icon William Shakespeare. And of course, Belle teleports to her beloved birthtown of Paris--right after she goes on about her favorite play, Romeo & Juliet.<br/><br/>Even ignoring the lead actors' British accents, any immersion created is constantly broken by the inappropriate callbacks to British culture in what is supposed to be a rustic French setting. At some point, the producers should have just cut the BS and set the film in England. The laziness of the setting's execution, as well as the lack of research that led to it, is part of a larger issue. No element of this film feels authentic or that anyone put the time into making sure it was right. <br/><br/>'Beauty & The Beast' is nominally set in France, yet is unabashedly English. Belle and the Beast's relationship is supposed to be front and center, but Emma Watson's rigid performance, the Beast's poor CGI, and an emphasis on plot development over character development leaves them as nothing more than a hollow sideshow. And for a movie whose core message is to not judge by appearance, there is a weird emphasis on gaudy visuals that choke out the original's subtle emotion.<br/><br/>In the end, 'Beauty & The Beast' live-action edition's inability to stay true to the original's identity makes for a boring, rudderless movie with no message. It is not offensively bad, but surely not worth spending two hours on either."
"KillerRomance","7","2","8","27 July 2017"," Stunning movie not ISIS motivated, doesn't promote domestic violence, nor anti gay but Emma Watson was no Belle of the ball
","First of all, my review won't be like one commenter from Japan who declared that the movie is ""anti-gay"" when the movie finally portrays a Homosexual character (that some reviewers find it hard to accept gay people exist), or as she pointed out the Enchantress is like ISIS in Syria because of punishing a smug Prince and his guests, dear me! If she watched the animation that has the same ""ISIS"" concept then she lost the plot. Including nonsense about Stockholm Syndrome, when it is about two people developing a soul and connection in each other, or one reviewer said it ""promotes domestic violence"". Don't watch it with your inane sensitivity and warped crazy logic. Simple as that! <br/><br/>So on to the Review. The Cartoon animation of Beauty and the Beast (1991) was one of my favourite Disney movies besides The Lion King. The movies back then capture your heart and imagination and all ages find this appealing.<br/><br/>Since Cinderella the Disney movies become real life motion pictures with a touch of Magic, or well made CGI. Cinderella was amazing.<br/><br/>Now Beauty and the Beast has this same treatment, there is a more detailed introduction than the animation about Prince Adam who is handsome but vain and turned cruel, and the Beautiful Enchantress that disguised as a Hag in offering a Rose, had put him under a spell as a Mephistopheles hulking looking creature, along with everyone inside the palace, including the Guests which became a enchanting prison.<br/><br/>Years passed when 17 year old well read Belle (Watson) is pursued by Gaston (Luke Evans) until her Papa (Kevin Kline) is caught captive during his Journey into a mysterious Castle. She pursued after him with the help of the Family Horse ""Philippe"" to embark risk and fate.<br/><br/>In this Movie, a lot of famous dialogue was refrained in respect of the original masterpiece, which is a good thing. Some of the cast did a good job, Gaston, Lefou are the best characters and Plummette is beautiful and probably should have played Belle, because when I heard Emma Watson was chosen I wasn't that excited she seemed more tomboyish, Belle in animation is the prettiest Disney Princess and I imagined Leah Pipes, Emma Roberts, or even a girl like Lana del Rey that looks like a doll and full rosebud mouth if you catch my drift, and Belle was supposed to be quirky and well-read but Emma Watson wasn't at all. Years ago Disneywords on Twitter suggested Anne Hathaway as real life Belle which was a good choice as I saw ""the Devil wears Prada"" so what went wrong? She is still young enough and gorgeous.<br/><br/>However I love the special effects on the characters and rococo 18th century french setting which I did enjoy, the CGI wolves are okay, maybe the movie makers don't want to use real wolves for some reason. The end credits have a golden Hollywood feel, it is like you come out of the opera House and you buy a DVD of the musical play and it is set up especially for you.<br/><br/>My overall reaction it was enjoyable and love both the Animation in the 1990's and this movie, glad to see there are some African actors in the village because they did exist in France in that era, but I wished they didn't pick Emma Watson because she is nothing like the Cartoon nor has warmth as the original Belle.<br/><br/>One more thing, lighten up it is only a fairy tale, don't get political and personal about it."
"lesleyharris30","8","2","8","12 May 2017"," A Pure Delight for all Disney Fans,
","Beauty and the Beast is a great movie with a very well developed plot and a mostly stellar cast. It is a heartwarming, inspired live action adaptation of the Disney animated classic, that still has a fun, cartoon-like flamboyancy that makes it feel like the original is truly being brought to life. All the terrific musical numbers are also still intact, and it is an absolute delight to see it being interpreted from different performers.<br/><br/>I was very underwhelmed by Emma Watson, who I actually found to be the weakest part of the film. I initially thought she was perfect casting for Belle, but she was actually very bland in the role, her heart was not with it, her singing voice was also very poor, being overly auto tuned. <br/><br/>The majority of the characters are very well casted, Dan Stevens adds a lot of humanity to the Beast and Luke Evan is a malicious, but still likable Gaston. The likes of Ewan McGregor, Ian McKellen and Emma Thompson shine as the talking cutlery, Lumiere, Cogsworth and Mrs. Potts, the highlight for me. <br/><br/>It is a loving tribute to the original. While it offers nothing new, Beauty and the Beast is great fun and I would certainly recommend it to anyone looking for a good family film. <br/><br/>After being forced to leave in a cursed palace ran by a beast to save her father's life, the young woman and the beast soon begin to fall for one another. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Luke Evans"

In so saying, however, frankly I SO love the 1991 animated Beauty and the Beast that there can not possibly be any improvement on it. When I hear 'Mrs Potts' sing, I want to hear Angela Lansbury. When Lumiere sings Be Our Guest, I want to hear Jerry Orbach. Seriously. This is a good version, if a version absolutely had to be made. But did it, beyond having to mix in some liberal views? Here's the thing, Walt Disney must be up there somewhere shaking his head in dismay. Not sure who or what is in charge of the Disney world now, but obviously someone who simply feels compelled to throw in politically correct foolishness to the nth degree – even if it means spoiling the movie for thousands and thousands of previous Disney fans.

","***WARNING: This review may contain spoilers***<br/><br/>The movie is nice but doesn't feel magical. Don't get me wrong. I like the movie. Here's what I think worked and didn't.<br/><br/>WHAT DID WORK: 1) I like the additions of backstory to the Beast's and Belle's mother stories. 2) The new songs were good. Belle's solo, the Beast's solo (showing him as a kid looking at his mother), and when the Beast was up on the tower after he released Belle to go back to her father 3) The more life-like movements of the candelabra and the clock 4) The Beast being Belle's ""book"" equal instead of being uneducated in the 1991 film 5) Emma Watson, Dan Stevens, and Luke Evans are good leads 6) The part where all the servants in their ""cursed state"" (dresser, candelabra, Mrs. Potts, Chip, the piano, and especially the leg rest / dog become immobilized (and practically dead) was truly emotional and done very well. 7) I actually liked the end credits (no surprise scene at end) 8) Nice to hear Celine Dion sing during the end credits (but I'm partial to her voice)<br/><br/>WHAT DIDN'T WORK: 1) They did a Brandy Cinderella-type version with town folk being white and black and multi-cultured...which made it look like a modern movie set instead of a fairy tale 2) Bad CGI for the wolves and the Beast's face 3) The Village people reuniting with the ""new"" reformed castle at the end and realizing there are some relationships that were crisscrossed with each other 4)Emma Watson's songs were partially auto-tuned 5)Biggest disappointment for me was the ""Beauty and the Beast""-song and the dance. That was the scene that ""made"" the 1991 movie, but the way the whole scene was filmed did not make it seem magical. I was waiting for the scene where Beast escorts Belle into the dance floor (which was imitated in the movie ""Enchanted""--but nothing like that here. Unfortunately, it was regrettable and more people are talking about Emma Watson's yellow dress than this scene. <br/><br/>There are more things that worked and more things that didn't work, but these are some to give you an idea."
"hotrina89","7","2","8","19 March 2017"," Great movie but the cast could have been better
","This film could have easily been an 8.5 but unfortunately this could not be. Emma Watson was not the best actor for sweet, friendly, enthusiastic Belle. From the beginning of the movie Belle seemed so.... distant, cold, dull, boring. She was nothing like Belle from the animated classic at all. Emma Watson was definitely not for this role and its very disappointing. And oh my goodness--- Emma's singing and the drastic attempt to fix her singing with effects. That was horrible! I noticed that the sound was... off during singing. How easy is it to find a Belle that has an upbeat attitude, is pretty and sings really well? These days they rather cast famous actors for the role, rather than the best actor for the role--- to make more money. The film suffers for this.<br/><br/>Other than the Emma Watson disappointment (since shes the main character) the graphics could have been better. The beast looked too fake. I know that they could have made it more believable.<br/><br/>Overall, I loved the movie because it reminded me of the good old days.<br/><br/>P.S. I think the Prince looked better as the beast. Lol.

","It primarily WANTS to BE the Disney animated film, but it pales in comparison.<br/><br/>In terms of vocals, everyone outshines Watson.

I stand by the idea that singers should be cast over actors. Musicals depend on strong, trained voices.<br/><br/>The scenes that entertained me most happen to be where Watson wasn't present. I like her as an actress, but she wasn't very strong here.<br/><br/>I watched the film for a class assignment. It really did feel like homework. Ewan McGregor and Ian McKellen were my favorites."

Beauty and the beast was never my favorite animated Disney film, but it ran plenty of times in my VHS player. This live action one had all the great songs and some new ones. I wasn't in love with the new ones, but it was a change that set it apart from its animated counterpart. The casting for gaston was pretty good. Wish they found a bigger guy or made him look more rugged. Emma Watson felt a little off kilter in this role. She doesn't have a strong singing voice and that is something i remember strongly from the animated Bell. Her acting wasn't on point. It didn't look right, I wish i could explain it. I really don't want to call her a bad actor, but......this role wasn't too right for her. The beast was not as bad as i was expecting. He had some charm and the CGI wasn't too bad....though it would of been cool if it looked as good as the one from the animated movie.

"Robert_duder","8","2","9","9 May 2017"," Expected a rehash and once again Disney surpasses expectations
","Say what you will about Disney but whomever is at the helm nowadays is brilliant. So far their live action renditions have brought in Billions. Beauty and The Beast might be the first of the truly modern day Animated classics they've ""rebooted"" in a live action way. I thought it looked cool and was excited to see it but cautiously so because wouldn't it just be the same thing seen before in Animation? In short...yes. In long, it didn't matter! The direction, cinematography and seeing the classic fairy tale in live action makes it all the more impressive. It is perfectly cast and wonderfully performed. I found myself excited for the familiarity of some of the musical numbers and really enjoyed the story all over again. I saw a review or two that called the film trash for being liberal and I still can't wrap my head around that. I wish this over-PC world would calm itself and just enjoy something for a change. Disney is brilliant because they found a way to remake their classic films for a new generation but they also don't skimp on sheer quality. These films Beauty and The Beast included are magnificent with huge budgets so it is understandable why they're doing it and I will keep seeing them for sure!<br/><br/>It seemed something of a controversy to cast Emma Watson but I think she does a very good job. I think she is finally breaking the mould that was the Harry Potter franchise. She is really perfect as Belle. It's not exactly a meaty part and she's beautiful and headstrong and makes for a good heroine. Dan Stevens is excellent as The Beast. He is as good as his animated counterpart from years ago. He perfectly captures the personality and torment and still shows some fierce loyalty to Belle. Their chemistry together is perfect for the film. It's not too intense but not understated either. In a film like this where the characters are iconic and so Disney-esque, the supporting cast is as important as ever. Luke Evans and Josh Gad are absolutely perfectly cast as the villainous Gaston and his henchman LeFou. Kevin Kline, Ewan McGregor, Ian McKellen, Emma Thompson (still would have loved to have seen Angela Landsbury return), Nathan Mack, Audra McDonald and Stanley Tucci all add something truly special to the film in their own way. Some of the more iconic characters (Lumiere and Cogsworth) are more understated I thought this time around but maybe that is okay for a live action film. Gaston is also more evil than he was in the animated version. Things are just turned up more in this version. It's a little darker, a little more vivid and large and a little more magic.<br/><br/>Bill Condon was a very interesting choice for the director of Beauty and The Beast. He has a lot of experience but I wouldn't have expected him to be able to pull this off. He plays things very safely. He makes sure all the things that fans of Beauty and The Beast would expect BUT he also gives it just a little bit more to keep new fans and old fans locked into a whole new remake. It's a beautiful film and stands beside it's animated counterpart. Time will tell if it will be a classic as well. 8/10"
"sfgebel315","8","2","9","20 March 2017"," Just as Magical, But 3 Major Criticisms
","I loved the cast. I LOVE Luke EVANS! He he has a wonderful singing voice and was a fantastic actor. He was the perfect Gaston. Just as Gad was the perfect LeFou. He had the goofy sidekick part down, but also held his own when he sings ""Gaston"". McGregor was the perfect Lumiere, I thought Stevens was a wonderful Beast and actually found this voice and appearance more majestic than the animated one that just looked more monstrous.<br/><br/>I only have three complaints: <br/><br/>1. Belle does not read while she walks as much. She's supposed to have her nose in a book for the entire ""Belle"" song, and yet, she does not even have her nose in the book when they say the line ""nose stuck in a book"".<br/><br/>The reason this upset me so much is that this specific scene of Belle walking through town reading and being oblivious to everything around her was what made her my favorite character and made this one of my favorite stories. In the original Belle is reading as she maneuvers through the market and rather than stop reading she just raises her hand to hold up the inn sign so it blocks the water from hitting her. I felt like I was Belle, because I walked while reading ALL THE TIME. Seeing Belle do this made me feel less weird and I loved it. Therefore, having the newest version of Belle simply walk with the book at her side was very disappointing to me.<br/><br/>2. Gaston does not throw Belle's book in the mud. Instead he walks over her cabbages.<br/><br/>It's a critical change, in my mind. Belle is portrayed as weird because she reads, her head is always in the clouds and she's too intelligent for a woman. Gaston, the village hero represents their way of thinking, actually comments on this by saying ""It's not right for a woman to read, she starts getting ideas and thinking"". Then he throws her book in the mud. It is symbolic of the fact that the whole village disagrees with her love of books, and further proves why Gaston is not for her, especially with the juxtaposition of the Beast showing her his library. Books are a critical part of this story. Books are the reason the villagers think Belle odd. Books are the reason the Beast and Belle get along so well. Books are the reason Gaston is clearly wrong for her.<br/><br/>So I'm sorry, as a girl who decided the castle in Beauty and the Beast was better than all the others because of the library, a girl who hated Gaston and actually cried when he threw a book in the mud, a girl who related to Belle because she too walked and read simultaneouslyof course I am going to be critical of the book scenes.<br/><br/>3. Gaston leaves Maurice to die by wolves in the forest.<br/><br/>Gaston is the villain of the story, no question. However, I always interpreted him as an arrogant bully who was meant to be the foil character. He's more into physical strength than intelligence, and he's more into material things than emotional understanding. He prides himself on hunting trophies and wants Belle because she's the most beautiful girl in the village. Then at the end of the film he tries to kill the Beast, but we're to know that's because he is the symbolic character that represents all of the village and people who judge based on appearances alone. He wants Belle for her looks, and he tries to kill the Beast because of his looks. This film and this message fit perfectly with the idea of ""Don't judge a book by it's cover"". In this version he wants Belle so badly that he's willing to leave her father in the forest to die when he gets in his way. This takes Gaston's villainy to a whole new level<br/><br/>Aside from those three criticisms I loved this film. I loved how one of my favorite stories was brought to life. I cannot believe I was 1 when the first film came out and saw this one for my 27th birthday. watching this live-action version is how I celebrated my 27th birthday. <br/><br/>But as they say, it's a tale as old as time."

","I never expected much from a live action remake of a cartoon classic, so I had low expectations. I did not care about the hype either. The only interesting thing about the movie is the use of 3D. Apart from that, the story is not new, it is just a conversion of the animated version to live action. The musical numbers were inferior to the original. The only good part of the movie is Luke Evan's role as Gaston. The minute I learned he was cast as Gatson, I knew he would be wonderful. In fact, his character was the most interesting in the movie. Emma Watson was okay, but fails to exude her 'Hermione' in Belle. The cast of talented actors did not help elevate the story much. Ian McKellen, and Emma Thompson are wasted. The CGI was terrible too. The Beast effects was very unrealistic and distracting. All in all, the only reason to enjoy this movie is because of the 3D, Luke Evans, and nostalgia. It would be a good movie for kids who have not seen the original animation."
"kasutirochan","7","2","9","19 March 2017"," Nostalgia factor is key.
","I thought the movie was fine. However, there were so many things that this new adaptation missed.<br/><br/>And among the things missed, was the feisty, sassy, charismatic Belle that I'd known and loved. There was a warm girl with a big heart, and she was fully present in the original movie. In this remake, starring Emma Watson, Belle was much colder. Belle didn't capture your heart. There was a detached feeling. Emma Watson is a perfectly good actress, but she wasn't Belle, she was not Belle at all.<br/><br/>The CGI on the Beast was horrible, but I learned to grow used to it as the movie progressed. I really didn't become fully immersed into the movie until it was almost over. <br/><br/>By far, my favorite actors in the movie would have to be the two playing Gaston and Lefou. They breathed new life into their characters, they made things interesting. I very much enjoyed them whenever they were on screen, but that must have been the only positive contribution made here.<br/><br/>What's that saying? ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it""? The only benefit I found in this was the waves of nostalgia I received from hearing all of the classic musical numbers and seeing the iconic yellow dress as Belle and the Beast waltzed across their ballroom. I still love, love, LOVE, this story. I love Beauty and the Beast and the strange sadness and longing for old Disney films that it inspires within me. I couldn't help comparing the 2017 version to the 1991 version, and feeling slightly disappointed (at times), throughout the movie.<br/><br/>This film was just a cash grabber. I'm sure we've got many live action movies coming up in the next couple years. We'll probably be seeing a real-life Mulan, Aladdin, etc., etc., in the next few years. I re-watched the original movie at home, and really felt that there was so much more that could've been done for the remake. The Beast just wasn't as temperamental, or lovable, as the original. Belle wasn't the kindest or most accepting, either. I didn't hate Gaston as much in this adaptation either, when --frankly-- I should have, even if just a little."
"ReelLifeReviews","8","2","9","18 March 2017"," Best live-action so far
","Beauty & the Beast - We find ourselves with yet another live-action Disney remake. These have been hit or miss for me so far, with Maleficent being the worst example of their recent retellings. In watching the trailers for Beauty & the Beast, I was finding myself let down more and more with each one. If Maleficent was the CTRL + ALT + DLT of its original story, this was shaping up to be just a Copy/Paste. I had cooled on the idea of seeing it, but then I remembered- I review movies. ;)<br/><br/>Right out of the gate the movie is every bit its predecessor, but it does eventually find opportunities to offer unique moments. After all is said and done it ends up being an excellent blend old and new.<br/><br/>Of the old, it has word for word exchanges from the original, with even some of the same blocking. The characters transfer over seamlessly and it had the same grand moments with 'Be Our Guest' and the ballroom dance scene. I do have to say, however, that the dance from the original still takes the cake. The way the camera was sweeping around, in a cartoon mind you, was just something that had never been seen before.<br/><br/>Of the new, we're introduced to two more songs this time around. I thought the Beast's new solo was incredible and I played it again when I got home. The movie of course is mostly live-action, but there are quite a few CGI-only scenes peppered in. I was impressed with all of the animations, except for the Beast himself. While the other elements seemed to have weight to them, his face felt very cartoonish and flat. With how the Jungle Book excelled in its animation, this felt like a bit of a step back.<br/><br/>Obviously there was all the commotion about Lefou before the movie came out. I'm not sure why they felt it necessary to do a press release about it rather than just having the character be who he was, but it was of course fine. About as subtle as a hammer, but fine. And if you thought the original Lefou didn't hold a torch for Gaston, you might want to watch it again.<br/><br/>Beauty & the Beast has all the 'feels' of the original and then some. The music is a major part of that, but the fact that all of the actors showed up with their A-game contributed as well. But if you want to go see it and then try to tell me you didn't like it- be my guest :) 8.5/10."
"julia-00157","8","2","9","18 March 2017"," LeFou Finds Prince Charming
","Beauty and the Beast, a tale as old as time. A long beloved and somewhat controversial fairy tale that not everyone was willing to see made live. Disney is still at the beginning of their phase of remaking classics into live action films, with Beauty and the Beast being the third (I believe) that is just a remake as opposed to a new take, after Cinderella and the Jungle Book. Everyone knows the story: a prince (Dan Stevens) is cursed to be a beast until he finds true love, and an opportunity arises when a smart, different girl (Emma Watson) enters his castle. The new, evolved story answers some questions that the animated version left open ended, like what happened to Belle's mother, what happened to Beast's parents, and more details about the enchantress's magic on the castle. The Beast is earned some sympathy with a backstory, yet is it also covered why he got himself cursed, being a selfish, rude prince as opposed to just an orphaned eleven year old turning an old lady away at the door. Belle is evolved to be a modern woman in an olden time. She is the inventor, instead of her father, who is an artist. She attempts to teach a young girl to read, which the village sees as absurd and unnecessary. She actually gives the village a reason to despise her. She is also more headstrong and determined, trying to escape when captured at first. <br/><br/>The move itself is dazzling and charming. From the very beginning, the sets and costumes are to be admired. It captures you in a fairy tale. The musical scenes are cartoony yet beautiful, simply an animated world come to life. The castle and its inhabitants are a display of the talent in the design team behind the movie. It takes a bit of getting used to, with Cogsworth and Lumiere redesigned into more elegant furniture pieces, and Mrs. Potts and the Wardrobe looking nearly unrecognizable from their previous designs. Seeing the beast more humanized was weird and I am not sure if it was the right choice. It kind of eliminated the whole 'looking past horrifying' when he was basically just a large, hairy man with horns. <br/><br/>The movie allowed time for Belle and Beast to actually know each other and become friends and form a relationship before they fell in love. Beast is also a bookworm in this version, already having the giant library as opposed to just getting it to win over Belle, leading to a more genuine relationship. The performances were cartoony, as to be expected. They are portraying animated characters, so everyone knows their acting would be a bit, well, animated. <br/><br/>If you are either avoiding or praising this for it's ""exclusively gay moment"" featuring Josh Gad's character, LeFou, I wouldn't hold your breath. LeFou, Gaston's little friend, is obviously infatuated with him. This is mostly for comedic purposes, however. Later in the movie, when the villagers are storming the castle, the wardrobe puts three men who are attacking her in dresses. Two of them go screaming, while one is very happy dressed up like that. In the finale, him and LeFou are ballroom dancing together for a split second. If you blink, you miss it. LeFou also gets redemption after Gaston turns him away one too many times. A few new songs are added to the new version to fit in new parts of the story. Obviously not as good as the original songs, and largely forgettable, however. <br/><br/>As someone who loved the animated movie and princess Belle growing up, I was happy with the remake. It captured most of the same magic and made me smile. If you're upset that this 'remake theater' is what Disney has chosen to do, that is fine, but do not regard it as a bad movie just because of that."
"nchareonsup","8","2","9","17 March 2017"," Definitely lives up to the classic!
","Coming from someone who grew up on Disney movies and who's favorite classic Disney movie has and always will be Beauty and the Beast,this movie absolutely lived up to my expectations and more.<br/><br/>Emma Watson did such an amazing job as Belle. The rest of the cast were just as perfect for their roles from Luke Evans as Gaston, to Emma Thompson as Mrs. Pots, etc.<br/><br/>Although there were minor differences in the story line, it didn't take away from the important parts of the movie. I didn't even mind the new addition of songs that were not part of the classic as it helped tie everything together so well.<br/><br/>I also enjoyed that they dove a little deeper into both Belle and Beast's background story and showed much more of how their friendship grew and eventually transitioned into romance.<br/><br/>All in all, I believed it achieved its goal in staying true to the classic while also giving us a new perspective from a live action version. I can't wait to watch it again! <br/><br/>Job well done!"
"DCHybrid02","7","2","9","17 March 2017"," It actually impressed me
","I'll start by saying this. ""Beauty and the Beast"" is one of my favorite Disney movies ever. Probably only second to Mulan. Of course, I always enjoy the singing, but what I enjoyed most were the characters, especially Cogsworth, Lumiere, and Mrs. Potts. I loved the dynamic between them and the Beast. And concerning the Beast, I was always impressed with Robbie Benson's ability to go from gruff and feral to sweet and gentle.<br/><br/>When I went to see this movie, I was cautiously optimistic; I didn't want one of my favorite childhood movies to be ruined. It was actually better than I was expecting it to be. It will never be the 1991 movie, but I still managed to get a lot out of the film.<br/><br/>My biggest qualm with this movie was Emma Watson. I love her to death, but I can't say that I enjoyed her singing too much. I was perfectly happy with the acting, but I think it would've been better to dub the singing parts with an actual singer or to have just cast a better singer. The quality of her singing versus that of others was starkly apparent. Other than that, I loved seeing her again.<br/><br/>The movie's also missing that back-and-forth banter between Lumiere and Cogsworth. There's some of it in there, but it's not nearly as funny as it was in the animated movie.<br/><br/>Now for the good stuff. I'm so glad that they brought Alan Menken back because he did it again! Even 20 years later, he manages to make such terrific songs. It's amazing! I'm pretty fond of the old songs, but the new ones are simply to good to ignore.<br/><br/>A lot of the stuff from the 1991 movie is in this one. There are also some new scenes that sort of give you a little more insight into certain characters. Lefou is certainly more respectable here than he is in the animated movie and seems much less deserving of his name.<br/><br/>I thought the CGI was pretty good with maybe the possible exception of the Beast. He didn't look horrible, but I wish he'd looked different. Certain features of his looked odd at times. Like his legs. They looked a little too big to me. But the CGI in ""Be Our Guest""? That was amazing! A very entertaining show! <br/><br/>I'm glad that I saw this. I was having doubts, even while sitting in the movie theater, but I was very happy with what I'd seen when I left."
"Shayelaine22","8","2","9","17 March 2017"," Lovely!
","Beautifully done film! No complaints from me. Where there a few flaws? Yes, but I am one that can overlook that. I enjoyed all the actors. The stand outs for me where Luke Evans, Josh Gad, and Kevin Kline. Definitely a fun family film and I look forward to Disney's other live action movies."
"Tellyvixen","4","1","3","1 December 2019"," Not as good as it should have been
","To start off they found about a 30 minutes of unnecessary screen time to add in events that weren't needed. They changed scenarios in the film to fill out the run time and just to make thing darker and grimmer and even more violent than they should have been.<br/><br/>This is the first time I've seen Emma Watson in action. She seems a good actress but she was completely miscast for this show. Most of the cast weren't that good and the characters themselves just weren't that likable and were flat.<br/><br/>The music and singing also just falls flat and for that matter so was the special effects. There were some lovely scenes but a lot of effects had no impact."
"acedj","8","1","3","11 November 2019"," Stunning remake
","If you are unfamiliar with the story of Beauty and the Beast, then you must have lived under a rock for a very long time. I shall not talk about the plot or story line here, but rather my immense surprise at how extremely well done was this movie. First and foremost, I do not know if Emma Watson's singing voice was touched up in post production, but she sings extremely well. I have never fully cared for her work up to this point. I never enjoyed the Harry Potter films, and really hadn't seen her in anything else since. By pure happenstance, I was flipping through channels and ended up watching part of this. I really enjoyed the 91 version, so I ordered the live action and finally sat down to watch it. Disney did such a tremendous job with this. I have never been a fan of taking a cartoon and making a live action film from it. To me they usually lose something in the translation. This is not the case here, as Disney improved the original. This is a visually gorgeous movie that is very well done."
"jviaes","4","1","3","26 October 2019"," Too Woke
","Did not really enjoy it. The characters of the original were lively and entertaining. The characters in this film were drab. The beast should have looked and acted much more ferocious. I think they should have done more than just digitally put the actor's face on the beast.<br/><br/>Also,  Lefou? They weren't even daring enough to keep him as a bad guy. Because they made him interested in men, they decided to not have him be bad at the end but realize the truth of Gaston being monster. Honestly, if Lefou was ""in love"" with Gaston (which I believe was a big mistake) wouldn't make sense for him to blindly follow him no matter what? It was something they did not need to do and could have kept the character as he was originally.<br/><br/>The movie is further woke as they feature three bad guys finding themselves dressed in women's clothing. Two flip out and run in terror as one embraces it and an enchanted wardrobe cheers him on. Really? It felt like a game of how much woke they could cram into one movie.<br/><br/>The wokeness continues as they try to fit in all different races and feminism. Instead of just focus on the original story and building something new off of it, they decided to run away with ideals fit more for adults."

","This movie is just so... wrong, yet could've been so right.<br/><br/>The casting of Emma Watson was all wrong. She comes off way too strong. Belle was not a warrior. She had a gentleness that is lost with Emma Watson. And Dan Stevens, while still giving a strong performance, seems uncomfortable somehow. And neither of them seem to have any sort of chemistry whatsoever.<br/><br/>While overall the visuals are lovely, a lot of the CGI is very... off in a way.<br/><br/>Good on paper, but very bland.

"kurnianyang","8","1","3","12 May 2019"," Almost the same, but more teasing
","The Walt Disney Studios produced a live action film entitled Beauty and the Beast. Starring Emma Watson, Dan Stevens, and Luke Evans, the film's classic tale adaptation has successfully made many people curious, especially for Disney movie lovers. The Walt DisneBeauty and the Beast was adapted from the legendary tale, A Tale as Old as Time, which was also an animated version in 1991. Besides successfully winning two Oscars, the film was also named one of the most popular animated films of all time.
Beauty and the Beast proved to be successful in performing beautiful musical films, moreover the songs that were performed were also successful, making us nostalgic. Basically the film is made almost similar to the animated version so it does not offer anything new but success in makes us fascinated. The plot is still the same. Belle (Emma Watson) is a beautiful village flower girl who is not very liked by residents because she is a nerdy. But wait a minute, not everyone hates it. Is Gaston (Luke Evans), a woman's ideal man who not only likes but is obsessed with making Belle his wife. The tough jaws and sharp nose of Gaston did not make Belle stunned.
When Belle's father, Maurice (Kevin Kline) is lost in the forest, Belle discovers that the father turned out to be a prisoner of the Beast and locked up in the castle in the middle of the forest. Belle insisted on replacing the father's position. It's no secret that Beast turns out to be a handsome prince (in the form of Dan Stevens) who turns into an ugly creature because of the witch's curse. The only thing that can eliminate the curse is true love, of course. However, no one can tell Belle that the curse will be permanent when the last rose petals stored in the western part of the palace fall. So the furniture consists of the Lumiere candle lamp (Ewan McGregor), the Cogsworth table clock (Ian McKellen), the Mrs Potts (Emma Thompson) teapot, the Wardrobe (Audra McDonald), the piano (Stanley Tucci), and the others trying to block them so the prince and they can return to being human before it's too late.
Of course, Beauty and the Beast can not be separated from the touch of the CGI. but CGI on Beast appearance and some animals look less smooth. The film also tends to lift dark nuances, on the other hand the film is able to display the feel of a typical Disney fairy tale. As in the animated film, this film also takes the setting of stories in a village in France.Since the opening scene that shows its visual charm, I have enjoyed every aegan in this film. even though there are scenes that are a bit bland, Beauty and and the Beast are good at teasing."
"kaylzcoco","2","1","3","17 April 2019"," Boring
","I was usually a huge fan of this Disney film and was excited to watch it, which left me disappointed. There was zero chemistry between Belle and the beast. I was even shocked when she declares her love for him as I didn't feel like there was any chemistry to begin with. Her crying out her love for him is faker than the Nike sneakers I bought from the China mall a week ago.<br/><br/>Don't get me started on the Beast's accent or his appearance. I love Emma, huge fan, but she had as much expression as a potato. Overall very boring, could have just watched the original and probably enjoyed it a thousand times more."
"ge-33586","2","1","3","4 April 2019"," Soulless and bland, unlike the original film.
","Of all the actresses, they could've picked to play Belle, they had to choose Emma Watson. No emotions, the chemistry between her and the Beast is so fake and forced.<br/><br/>I seriously hated the way the relationship between Belle and the Beast was developed. In the original, the two characters actually took time getting to know each other, whereas in this film, all of that just gets thrown out of the window.<br/><br/>The worst is the auto tune, if you hired an famous actress to be in ONE of Disney's most beloved musical films, at least hire an famous actress who can SING!!! Because the fact that they chose to auto tune Emma's singing just sucks the life out of those songs.<br/><br/>The only good thing about the movie was Audra MacDonald,."

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","5","1","3","23 July 2017"," Exactly what you'd imagine — which is either perfect or a little disappointing
","One of Disney's most treasured animated musicals of the '90s and perhaps its most critically acclaimed, ""Beauty and the Beast"" was understandably high in the queue for in the studio's recent spree of live-action remakes. Led by the popular and talented Emma Watson as Belle and under the veteran guidance of director Bill Condon (""Dreamgirls,"" ""The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn""), the film had a clear blueprint for success, which it follows — if a little too precisely.<br/><br/>The film captures the spirit and aesthetics of the 1991 classic, but in ways that are on the nose. The costumes and even some of the choreography (and not just the dancing) feel lifted from the original and plopped into three dimensions. Undoubtedly there's something thrilling about seeing a beloved cartoon recreated in photorealistic detail, but that's where the entertainment — specifically the novelty — ends with ""Beauty and the Beast.""<br/><br/>All the components honor the ""source material,"" avoiding any obvious areas of disappointment. Watson brings all her charms and a perfectly pleasant voice to Belle, Dan Stevens is fearsome, handsome and possesses just the right pinch of humor as the Beast and Gaston couldn't have been better cast than Luke Evans — and that's leaving out the delightfulness of Ewan McGregor (Lumiere), Ian McKellen (Cogsworth), Josh Gad (LeFou), Emma Thompson (Mrs. Potts) and even Kevin Kline (Maurice). These voices and faces fill a production design that nails the essence of the animated film. If you were to imagine each cell come to life, it would look like this movie.<br/><br/>The question ""Beauty and the Beast"" raises is whether the act of re-creation is enough to justify the entire production. Box office receipts say yes, that audiences are content to simply re-experience the magic of a familiar story in a different medium, but there's something uninspired about this ""Beauty"" and it puts every aspect of the movie in charge of covering up the stink of commerciality. <br/><br/>At over two hours long, there's an extra 40 minutes of material here compared to the original, a huge chunk of time that in theory should provide an expanded ""Beauty and the Beast"" experience. That time goes toward a couple new songs and more developed backstories for Belle and others in an attempt to fill in some of the hollow stereotypes that needless to say —bless Disney's heart — make the 1991 film culturally dated.<br/><br/>Attempts to expand Belle's peculiarity and bookishness definitely cast her as a 21st century-appropriate heroine as opposed to a 20th century ""princess."" This Belle is an inventor, she's chastised for teaching a young girl to read and she refuses to be a damsel in distress. These personality enhancements are no surprise for a character played by Watson, which suggests they might have been the work of screenwriter Stephen Chbosky, who Watson brought in from ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower."" Of all the new components Chbosky and Evan Spiliotopoulos (""The Huntsman: Winter's War"") bring to Linda Woolverton's original script, the way they develop Belle is the most effective and value-adding. <br/><br/>Generally, however, whether it's LeFou's vague sexuality or that Belle was born in Paris, none of the new script material or even brand new Alan Menken songs bolster the tentpoles of this story — its magic and its emotional story of love conquering all. That satisfying feeling when all is righted in the end — the pinnacle of emotion that made the original a Disney classic — doesn't reach the same heights in this version. Or, it does, but without evoking that same feeling with renewed passion.<br/><br/>Disney doesn't need much of an excuse to keep churning out these live-action redos, but they will need to find some new creative energy in order to entice more than '90s-pining nostalgists to watch these films instead of revisiting the old ones.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

"RubenJansen97","5","1","3","13 July 2017"," It still manages to enjoy and surprise some moments. Sadly they forgot to tell a realistic feeling love story between the Beauty and a Beast.
","*No major spoilers, some minor plot points are discussed.*<br/><br/>Characters and Acting: So the original cast was perfect. In this remake there are only a few actors that feel perfect. I mostly like Luke Evans as Gaston, I thought he was excellent. Some of the supporting cast is close to improving over the original. Especially Ewan Mccregor and Sir Ian McKellen steal the show. They really seem to capture the spirit of their characters. With these people being pretty much perfect, everyone else is just 'good.' Emma Watson as Belle sort of fits the part. She has a good heart as Belle, and she can stand for herself when she needs to, but it still looks like she is just being Emma Watson for most of the time. The Beast is sadly one of the film most weak parts. I don't feel like he makes such a development over the course of two hours.<br/><br/>Story and Dialogue: The story is as expected mostly the same as the original. There are a few changes here and there, but some of them don't seem to add anything new to it, it's just done with the purpose of being different. There are here and there some added scenes that we never knew before about Belle or where she came from that are nice to know, but it eventually goes nowhere. My biggest disappointment however is the fact that I have only one flaw with the 1991 version; that being that the part where they fall in love goes kind of fast. With this film being around two hours, I was hoping they would improve my only flaw with the original. Sadly they didn't. Even worse: they pay even less time on the connection between Belle and the Beast, which would be the point of the entire movie. Right now it feels more like Belle stays at the castle because she has a good connection with the servants instead of the Beast.<br/><br/>Editing and Pacing: The editing in the movie is fine. It doesn't stand out, but it also doesn't distract you, so it does its job. The pacing however could be improved. When the 50-minute mark hit, I was asking myself if they would give the Beast some screen time. For the length this movie had it's a letdown that there is so less development in the relation between Belle and the Beast.<br/><br/>Music and Sound: Thankfully the makers noticed that you can't improve over the classical musical score of the original one, so its mostly the same. The singing however shifts from really good to laughably bad auto-tuning. I already said that Gaston sounded the best, also because Luke Evans really acted the singing in the scenes that he sung. When I see Emma Watson's Belle singing, it really sounds like it is recorded in a studio, and later dubbed in the movie. I believe the actors do sing nice, but I can't tell if they had to fix singing errors from the recording or if they just screwed up the sound mixing.<br/><br/>Cinematography and Effects: The movies gives a very good impression of how the look of the animated movie would look in real life. I love the design of the sets and the attributes. For the CGI effects, sometimes it looks great and so real you can swear you can touch everything you can see on the screen. But then there are also some scenes you swear you are watching a Pixar animated Disney film. Especially the big landscape shots really look distracting. Then you also have the Beast, who sometimes looks like he is actually there, but sometimes there are some awkward shots, like when he lays in bed, you wonder why one his horns keeps disappearing so weirdly behind his pillow. <br/><br/>Rewatchability: In terms of a watch I'd say: 'Sure, go watch this movie. Once.' For a re-watch, i'd say: 'Watch the original.' It's nice to have the knowledge of some added scenes that give some characters more backstory, but in the end it doesn't make this movie more special. Watch the old one again, with the knowledge that you get with this movie.<br/><br/>Deeper Meaning or Motives/Themes: The story has a beautiful message about beauty being not everything, it's about what is inside someone. Sadly I don't feel like I've experienced this message much in this movie. It's the fact that I know the story and I have already learned the message from the original, but I feel like this version doesn't express its main theme enough. Sadly they forgot to add the awesome red/blue color motive, look it up!<br/><br/>Tone: One more thing the movie does well is give a good mix between live- action and over-the-top animation humor and style. The sometimes over-the-top acting really fits in the movie, while also giving a sense that the characters are still actual people. This is hard to do and I give the movie credit for succeeding in tone.<br/><br/>Personal Response: I thought the first 45 minutes of the movie were the best. I almost wish they would transform the added scenes into animation style and add it to the 1991 version. After that it falls kind of flat, mainly because of the lack of interest in the Beast, which is a shame. Love should come from two sides, so it takes more that just developing Belle to keep us interested. I did enjoy the movie, but it is just a single time watch for me.<br/><br/>Conclusion: Seeing how it was a risk to remake one of the best animated movies of all time, Beauty and the Beast (2017) still manages to enjoy and surprise some moments. Sadly the filmmakers forgot to give the focus on the core story line that makes the original so good, that being a realistic feeling love story between the Beauty and a Beast."
"tamuidbeo","3","1","3","29 June 2017"," Emotionless with filler dialogue!
","What can I say the original is may fave all time Disney movie. So I was excited for this to come out, what a boring disappointment. Just like with the new flat Cinderella they just did the script must have been written by a failed High Schooler, needless words added here and there as if to fill space but making the movie feel forced. If you are going to redo a classic you better blow it out of the water, this however was pretty laughable compared to the original. Bell seemed like a statue like she had no real emotion it was just odd and I know Emma Watson can act, so what was this? The Beast aka Liboracchi well that was hilarious, he gets to be manly while a Beast but once he's human again he had more lace then Liboracchi would dare even ware, honestly killed the character quite a bit and wasn't cohesive as if he and the beast were the same person! We were hollering run Bell run the money's not worth it he's going to leave you for the pool boy! Either he is manly or dainty pick one Disney but what you did is completely make him two separate people, destroying the character really. The only good thing honestly about this movie was the inclusive characters but I think even that was sloppy and over done because Disney really wanted you to notice. The movie was terrible and just goes to show you can have some of the greatest actors like Ian Mckellen (not sure on spelling) and still have a flat movie with a terrible dialogue, leaving you at the end wondering where the rest of the movie is?"

","I rarely write movie review but i want like... 100% needs to write for this movie.<br/><br/>First of all, i find hilarious knowing the review for this movie is 7.5 out of 10. this movie is certainly overrated. it bothering my sense. <br/><br/>Lets started with the announcement that belle will play by emma watson. I was laughing at that time. I know emma watson are smart but she is no french and no pretty. Comparing to Lea Seydoux (2014 Belle) She is far from elegant. Why not cast french actress, Disney? You can started with Melanie Laurent or Adele Exarchopolous or Sonia Ben Ammar? The cast is like mocking entire nation for not have eligible actress to play this movie. <br/><br/>Oh yes, you want some highly intelligent actress or worldwide recognition profile. Why not started with chloe moretz? etc. etc. <br/><br/>And then when the movie premiere in cinema, i am not watch it because i was too lazy. I hear some hype here and there but i prefer watching ""Boss Baby"" at that time. <br/><br/>And now i just watch it online because i keep saying ""give it chances... give it chances... you like Cinderella, and maleficent, why don't this have no chances? <br/><br/>So i watched it and i cant stop laughing because:<br/><br/>1. Emma watson cant stop being hermione in this movie. She sometimes speak like french girl but the other time shout like a British girl. I don't understand why director wont re-shoot it. Oh you want to embrace culture difference? Fine, then why you make the prolog says the story take place in France? <br/><br/>2. The CGI character is scary... i have no idea if it is good for children or not <br/><br/>3. All cast (Except the one who play Lefou) cant sing and the worst is, score play team wont bother it. in fact they keep playing a same music like 1991 film and insist the cast to sing as same high pitch as 1991 cast. They even don't use auto tune to fix it. <br/><br/>4. Why all character wear white gown at party?<br/><br/>5. Why beast wear wig and overly white powder on his face at first scene? Omg this is hilarious! Ohhh... you want it to be historical accurate?? Fine then why is Belle character is so feminist?? She thinks she can handle herself without marriage while at that time, girls cant provide good life for herself without a man in her household. <br/><br/>Got it Disney?? Don't worry i still loves you and watch your next life action but i have to tell you that you can do better in this movie. Next time, please cast a charming girl to play a princess. You done well with Elle fanning and Lily James."
"Vartiainen","Null","1","3","22 June 2017"," Watered down version of the original classic
","Aside from this, I have seen Cinderella out of the new live-action Disney adaptations. And they do share certain similarities, but also certain key differences.<br/><br/>We all know the story of Beauty and the Beast. Cursed prince, a smart woman feeling trapped in a small provincial village, castle in the middle of nowhere, tale as old as time, and so on. The problem, at least when compared to Cinderella, is that they changed absolutely nothing. It's the exact same story, the exact same songs, the exact same characters. Almost scene by scene the same movie. There are a couple of added scenes that aim to deepen the character of the two main leads, but they seem exactly what they are: tagged on additions to pad out the runtime. Whereas Cinderella, while still sticking to the basic premise, significantly deepened the relationship between the main couple, changed the order of events and felt as a whole like a fresh movie while still paying an homage to the original.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the actors are better in this film. Emma Watson has her haters, but I've always liked her and she gives a credible performance here as Belle. Perhaps it's a bit distracting that the character is so similar to Hermione Granger, but that's what you get. Luke Evans makes for an incredible Gaston, probably the best character in the film, and Dan Stevens makes for a credible Beast. Although I do hope that they had made him at least partially with practical effects because now the CGI just isn't quite there with this budget.<br/><br/>That being said, the film looks fine overall. I'm not a huge fan of all-CGI effects like in this film, because it just doesn't look real unless done phenomenally well and perhaps not even then, but I can live with it. It helps that the designs and textures are thought out well.<br/><br/>As a whole this movie doesn't have much reason for existing. The original Beauty and the Beast looks, sounds and acts better as a story and as a film. These live-action remakes only make sense if you bring something new to the story. Still, as a standalone film, without the context, it's an okay piece of cinema."

So hard to please people. Yet another ridiculous controversy rumor floating around about ""auto-tune"" is another overblown false accusation. Haters are just always haters. Emma is an amazing singer and has a wonderful voice... Jealous, crazy people out there.<br/><br/>The first scene when Belle talks to her father, she bends over way too many times... that seemed almost too deliberate and calculated. <br/><br/>Josh Gad as Gaston's side kick is spot on. It's very risky and hard to top a classic legendary film, you can't expect this to surpass the original - I mean, nothing is going to take away the original anyway. Obviously it's not perfect, but it's still a nice addition. I enjoyed the set, hearing the classic songs again, totally didn't care for the new songs/new backstory - but it was still a magical experience."

Maleficent was blamed for reconstructing and altering the plot of the original movie. Disney learned its lesson and this doesn't happen in Beauty and the Beast! Maybe the actors' performance is not the best, but it's not bad either. Also, very good effects-cgi and very good taste of humor in many scenes!

","I am a big fan of the original movie. It was a cartoon, so the characters and their actions tended at times to be too silly and over the top. However, this did not stop it from being one of my favorite movies, containing some beautiful songs. The new Beauty and the Beast does not disappoint me at all. I thought all of the actors performed their songs very well, and I enjoyed the addition of some new melodies. Belle is beautiful, smart and sassy; the Beast is frightening, yet vulnerable and troubled; and Gaston is arrogant, vain and sexy. My only complaint, if you could call it that, is that the local girls enthralled by Gaston all looked like streetwalkers instead of village girls. They could have been pretty and not so trashy looking. This movie was enchanting, entertaining, funny, sad and thoughtful!"
"Samiam3","6","1","3","3 June 2017"," The whole package of everything we loved, except 'the love' itself
","The opening scenes of Beauty and the Beast are very hard to watch. This film is such an accurate blow by blow mimic of the 1991 Oscar winner that it even nails the timing between lines. Unfortunately this is a live movie with real actors, and actors need timing to give convincing performances. there is no timing here. The movie goes from one beat to another in spectacular fashion, and never catches its breath until halfway through the picture.<br/><br/>The highlight is the art direction. Beauty and the beast takes the gilded, spiralling and flowered motifs of Roccoco to the extreme, and the beast's castle looks like a big gold/brass jungle. The negative is that in order to see all this in full glory, director Bill Condon pulls his camera back so far that it becomes pretty obvious that we are in a sound stage.<br/><br/>Emma Watson has all the beauty of Belle, but not enough of the charisma. She is small, composed and vulnerable, and strangely unimpressionable. During the Be Our Guest number, she stares at the spectacle as if she on her forty fifth take and in need of a coffee. Her singing voice is fine, but she underplays her numbers.<br/><br/>How much credit to give Dan Stevens for his performance of the Beast, I'm not sure. Together with the painters/animators of his face, he does bring some humanity but not a great deal of character. As for the other inhabitants of the castle, The CGI bring Lumiere, Cogsworth and Mrs. Potts to life impeccably, but makes the mistake of minimizing their facial features, thus rendering out their character. What we get are not humans cursed with the form of house ware, we get house ware that talks and moves.<br/><br/>The best part of the movie is the middle act; between the second wolves attack and the iconic Beauty and the Beast dance scene. Condon tries to play cupid and get Belle and the Beast to fall in love. The script helps him by giving him some admirable new material to work with, but he cuts his these contemplative scenes too short. As a music number Beauty and the Beast succeeds in summoning a bit of warm and fuzzy nostalgia. This is the only song which comes close to making you feel like you were watching the material for the first time. Whats missing is the chemistry.<br/><br/>Condon stages a chaotic rendition of the fight between Gaston's mob and the Beast's army of house furniture, leading to Gaston and Beast coming face to face. Condon falls short here too by not giving them much of a fight. He also rushes the final spectacle of the movie where the beast is turned back into a prince. Belle watches and doesn't even flinch. She takes one looks at him and inherently seems to know what is going on, then they lock lips. The transformation of all the others (back into humans) is done with a bit more flair, not to mention humour.<br/><br/>Minus the muscles and singing voice, Luke Evans makes for a realistic Gaston, but it is his side kick 'gay' LeFou who hogs the spotlight. More than any individual, the imagery itself is the real star of the show, and there is too much of it. the scenery is over lit, it goes on forever and the camera never stays still. There is enough spectacle that you become almost numb to it. <br/><br/>Beauty and the Beast leaves you feeling depressed for all the people who Disney is cheating out of they're money. the movie itself feels like merchandise in a Disney store. It's a superficially enjoyable carbon copy of something real."

","Many had high expectations, considering the original was a masterpiece. I found it pretty average, costumes and sets were beautifully done but that's where it goes downhill for me. To be honest, it annoyed me Emma Watson's voice was so auto-tuned and her acting was overall mediocre. The only actors I did enjoy was Josh Gad (LeFou) and Luke Evans (Gaston), and Gaston was the only remade song I liked. I wasn't into the new content added to the story line, besides Evermore. To sum up, I kind of liked it as a movie on its own, but I didn't like it as a remake."

"hartma-15240","10","3","18","12 May 2017"," SPOILER ALERT- Magical
","*SPOILER WARNING*<br/><br/>First off: Casting Emma Watson as Belle- I think she's the closest person to Belle in the world. I thought that she didn't necessarily have the singing chops for the role, but having big shoes to fill, I think she handled it well.<br/><br/>Dan Stevens as the Beast- I really can't imagine any other person playing the Beast, he has a great voice, and his emotion is incredible and his acting itself is great.<br/><br/>Luke Evans as Gaston- I was rather upset that he physically looked nothing like the cartoon Gaston at first, but I grew to love him as an actor and in the end, his performance was outstanding.<br/><br/>Josh Gad as LeFou- Even though I could only hear Olaf the Snowman throughout the whole movie, I LOVED his performance. He's the perfect real life look alike of LeFou and his representation of LeFou was just incredible. He was perfect for the role.<br/><br/>Ewan McGregor as Lumiere- I seriously can't imagine a more perfect person for this role. He's a good looking guy, he DEFINITELY had the singing voice for this role as you can tell by his performance in Moulin Rouge, and he also has the acting skills. And his French accent sounded quite accurate to me. The way he portrayed the beloved candelabrum in this movie was outstanding.<br/><br/>Ian McKellen as Cogsworth- As a fan of McKellen's work, I was so intrigued to hear that he would be portraying the iconic Mantle Clock in this new movie! There was no negatives to his work during this live action motion picture.<br/><br/>Secondly: The Music<br/><br/>""Be our Guest"" BLEW me away! They clearly poured their blood, sweat and tears into creating that magical, classic musical number and that makes it so much more magical. And, if your're a musical fan, you'll love this number, considering there are several hidden references to classic musicals during the song. And like I said before, I loved Ewan McGregor's vocals during this song.<br/><br/>""Gaston"" this number specifically stole the show for me. With Josh Gad's performance, you can't take his eyes off him! He's so entertaining, and the clear friendly chemistry during LeFou and Gaston was so great. Josh Gad and Luke Evans both blew me away during this song and it was my favorite musical number in the movie.<br/><br/>The new songs: ""How Does A Moment Last Forever"" Sang by both Maurice and Belle in the movie. I preferred Celine's rendition which played in the credits. When Celine sang it, I understood the true emotion.<br/><br/>""Days In The Sun"" This was one of my favorite songs in this new movie. It's about all of the enchanted objects singing about their lives as humans and how they would enjoy more days in the sun instead of being trapped inside the castle. This song was so sad to me considering, the enchanted objects don't know if they'll stay as objects forever, and this song hit me hard for some reason.<br/><br/>""Evermore"" By far my favorite song from the new song, sang by the Beast. This was the one musical number that actually made me cry. It was so incredibly sad because it took place right after the Beast released Belle to go help her father. And he's singing about his inner devotion for Belle but he knows that she will likely never come back to him or love him back, so he has to stay in the tower forever.<br/><br/>Thirdly: New elements to the story<br/><br/>The curse- The enchantress removed all memory of the castle from the people who lived in the village, so now that makes sense why none of the villagers remembered it. The rose, doesn't have a specific year count for how long the Beast has to break the curse, he just has until all of the petals fall, not specifically ten years anymore.<br/><br/>The book- The enchantress also gave the Beast a book that allows him to travel, his only other view to the outside world. So him and Belle traveled to Belle's childhood home in Paris to find out what happened to her mother, her mother died of the Plague. For some reason Maurice could never bring himself to tell Belle what happened to her mother, they made it seem like some heartbreaking, crazy thing happened to her mother, but she only died of the Plague.<br/><br/>The enchanted objects- In the cartoon, after 10 years, the objects would stay the enchanted objects forever. But, in this version, after all the rose petals die, the actually became inanimate. They won't be able to walk anymore, or talk. They would become lifeless. I think that added much more pressure to the Beast, because if he didn't break the spell, all of his servants would actually die. And that just made the movie way more emotional whenever all the petals fell, and the Beast ran out of time. <br/><br/>LGBTQ+- There has been so much controversy with LeFou being openly gay as stated by director, Bill Condon. The movie was canceled from a lot of theaters due to that statement. But seeing the movie, I was disappointed, LeFou never came out and said he was gay and it honestly wasn't too obvious. It was blown way too out of proportion. Although, during the celebration dance at the end of the movie, LeFou began dancing with a man, that scene only lasted a second and a blink of the eye could miss it. And during the fight scene when the villagers invaded the castle. Madame De Garderobe, the Wardrobe, dressed up three men as women. Two of the men ran away screaming, while one man smiled and walked away with pride and confidence. I loved that scene so much.<br/><br/>Overall, I think this was the best movie I've ever seen in my whole life. It was so emotional and I recommend it."
"summerinertia","1","2","10","28 November 2017"," Disney continues to devour its own vomit
","This is a very traditional way that Disney movie makers kept doing. Slow tempo, wasted lot of money on settings, costumes, attire accessories, uniforms, weaponry....formatted dialog, predictable scenarios.....rigid 1 dimensional acting, no-brain directing, etc and etc.<br/><br/>But among all of these clichés, the worst in this film is the pathetic soundtrack. The first viewer has already pointed out this awful arrangement, but the problem of the western styled music is not just that bad, it's problem the music director or soundtrack supervisor used a music that got nothing to do with every scene, it just repeatedly played on and on; in fighting scenes, in the camp, during dialog, it just played on with the same tune, same tone. It's the soundtrack that bothered me so severely, so I just have to quit watching. What a stupid and boring movie. Another living example how the Chinese movie makers never understood how to spent the budget wisely. The fighting scenes are okay, but they were ruined by the emotionless soundtrack."
"boshrocks","10","2","10","11 April 2017"," Breathtakingly Beautiful
","Beauty and the Beast was by far my favourite Disney film growing up. So, naturally, I approached this live action version with some trepidation. I was worried they would ruin a classic, destroy a cherished childhood memory. Luckily they did not. Far from it in fact.<br/><br/>Director Bill Conden and Co have treated it with respect and love. The film they produced is gorgeous in it's nuances and beautiful in it's imagery. The cast do a stellar job of bringing the characters to life, developing their backstories and adding little twists and nods that enhance our understanding of them.<br/><br/>Even if some of the casting choices seemed a little unorthodox (Ewan McGregor as Lumiere and Emma Thompson as Mrs Potts) at first they grow on you and charm you as the film goes on. Indeed, the most unorthodox bit of casting, Emma Watson as the princess of the piece, proved to be the perfect choice for the role. Yes, admittedly, her singing could be better but it was not as auto-tuned as the media claimed it was and actually it sounds both lovely and sweet. Watson, herself, is lively and charismatic shouldering the weight of the film, as Atlas shouldered the world, with grace and delicacy. There was enough of Hermione in her characterisation which were already parts of Belle's character (the love of books, kindness of heart and her yellow dress moment being a grown up deja vu moment of the Yule Ball staircase scene in Goblet of Fire)<br/><br/>Another area of contention for the film, largely exaggerated by the media, was the introduction of Disney's first openly gay character in LeFou. In my opinion he always was gay, anyway, so I didn't see the big deal about the live action version of him. The gay moments, of which there are actually quite a few, are subtle and sweet and funny. A moment in the battle with LeFou's future love is really quite risqué by Disney's standards (Stanley loving how he looks in the fabulous dress) but it, and the other moments, are treated with great gentleness by the actors. <br/><br/>I will admit that I was somewhat disappointed with the Be Our Guest scene. That song is the showstopping moment in the cartoon version but here, although it does its best and is a whirlwind of colour, has something missing. They crammed several references to other Disney and musical things within it and it rushes through without really taking a breath. <br/><br/>The boys steal the film. Gaston is wonderfully butch and stupid, but also has backstory added with him being a war veteran. You can tell that he genuinely cares for Belle but as LeFou points out he is the real monster; hidden and now released. The Beast is magnificent. Again he has backstory and it was nice to see him a little before the curse; seeing how awful he was gives his character a good arc to redemption. I defy anyone, male or female, not to fall in love with Dan Stephens in this role. His rendition of Evermore is the highlight of the soundtrack and I shall lose all faith in the awards panels if they do not give that best song for every award going. Yes the Beast is cruel at first but you fall in love with him as Belle does. Their chemistry is wonderful and the moment after the transformation is heartbreakingly beautiful in the subtlety of their acting. In this version I did not prefer him as the beast to the prince, as I had with the cartoon version. In the live action version I loved both of them.<br/><br/>This is a wonderful film, both thrilling and uplifting. Just as Disney ought to be. I sincerely hope they continue in this fashion and remake many of their classics with the same love as they have with this Tale as Old as Time."

","At first I was skeptical about this movie, and then, month by month, I started to get very hyped and excited. Nevertheless, I still had my doubts regarding the director - I mean seriously, Twilight? Seriously?!? What was Bill Condon thinking when he accepted to involve himself in that sparkly mess? And of course, this extended to Emma Watson and Dan Stevens, as I could not imagine them worthy of playing my all time favorite characters from my favorite movie... Yes, I followed Dan's career since he played Edward Ferrars in ""Sense and Sensibility"" and I am a convinced Potterhead so Emma's acting skills were never in question. <br/><br/>I even postponed watching it because I was sooo afraid of spoiling the picture perfect created by the 1991 version, and also because I had read some reviews that were not so favorable...<br/><br/>Nevertheless, last Sunday I went to the theater, heart in my teeth, stomach in knots, expecting a big letdown. But, something magical happened from the very first scene. I forgot how to breathe properly, I barely blinked, entranced as I was by this marvelous piece of cinematography. I cried, squealed with delight, laughed, sobbed, sang along when my favorite tunes started and listened to the new ones breathlessly... I felt my heart grow heavy so many times, feeling I'm still experiencing on a daily basis whilst listening to the soundtrack... <br/><br/>Every moment, every image, every song, it all combines in an unique experience, enhanced by the 3D technology, compelling many of us to re-experience it again, and again, and again. <br/><br/>Ultimately, my advice is to go watch this movie, with an open heart and you won't be disappointed. Haters will be haters, they will continue to bash this movie, write negative reviews and advice against it. Don't follow my example, don't listen to my advice, do the smart thing and experience it yourself and then let your heart decide...."

","I seriously can't quite figure out why this movie doesn't have a 10/10 average. There are no flaws with the film. Score was great, cast was great, acting was great, plot was great, execution and directing 100% great as well as the sound mixing and overall color grading. The movie IMHO was perfect. I believe we need to start rating movies on flaws rather than basing our opinions off of preconceived notions from nostalgia. The movie on it's own was fantastic, even trying not to think or bias it from the original animated version. The problem with these sub-par reviews from other viewers that clearly have bias, is that they are contributing to Hollywood creating more terrible films. Disney needs to know that this movie was fantastic and most people generally loved it. If the industry thinks the movie wasn't that great based off of reviews, then they will change their future movies for the worse. 10/10, fantastic. Take it from a film composer, gamer, and movie lover."

","Beauty and the beast! The beast (pun intended) movie I've seen this year! The casting choice is just brilliant!! Emma Watson brings this charming and incredibly sweet side of belle. The songs are so good that I have downloaded them all! I had an excellent time watching this movie (twice) and I recommend you all go see it! The setting and the tiny changes they made in the movie make a huge difference and really for the best! I have no real words to describe this adorable and fun movie! Just go watch it!!!"

","Beauty and the Beast was my most favorite Disney movie ever and hearing the news that it's going to be with real actors...oh my gosh -I couldn't wait! And the movie met my expectations more than I could ever wished for!! Generally I loved the thing that it was so close adapted to the original...I think that was the purpose: To bring to the next generations as perfect as it was, but with the necessary fresh twist. From the first moment you hear the intro music, you feel the trigger of emotions in your spine....and it gets into you till the very end...Laughing, singing, crying....all the emotions you could feel watching the original, were all coming back, even stronger. Seeing your favorite characters come to life, makes it even more intense. The actors\actresses chosen couldn't be more perfect for their roles! Emma Watson was like she was born to be Belle...and so was Dan Stevens! His voice, his eyes..were a perfect match with the Beast! Josh Gad...?!! Oh my gosh...If there weren't those 26 years between this and the original, I would swear that the made LeFou watching Josh! Sooo identical! Luke Evans? Perfect! And all the rest as well. Plus there were so many extra elements in the movie that filled us some story gaps from the original, like what was like the Prince before the transformation or why did Belle and her father were so different from the rest of the villagers...And of course there are some new songs, which we are going to love equally I believe. Also all the technical stuff in there was so unbelievably amazing!...The castle, the rooms inside, the costumes...everything was made with perfect detail! Many times I got myself distracted from the characters staring the dazzling objects on the background. So, don't even hesitate a little...Watch and enjoy this wonderful movie!"

","This film was overall amazing! I give it an A-. My family & I have been obsessed with Beauty & the Beast for as long as I could remember! I was hoping for the film to be EXACTLY like the original, but we can't always get what we want. That being said, most of the changes in the film didn't take anything away from the original, however, the one part I was truly hoping they would keep the same was ""underdramatized"" & a little disappointing. As Belle flees the castle in the original, beast roars a beautifully agonizing roar to show his pain. In this film, he breaks into his own sad song. As his song was coming to a close, my family and I were at the edge of our seats desperately waiting to hear that roar, but to our dismay guys, it didn't happen! WHY???!!! WHY???!! We needed to feel his emotion Disney!! That was one of the greatest emotional parts aside from ""Tale as Old as Time"", & beast's transformation. :( Not to worry though, the finale (Gaston storming the castle, Beast dying & his castle staff dying - yes everyone dies and it is the saddest part EVER!) will completely bring you to tears & blow you away! Totally made up for it. Will be going back to see it again for a second time!"

","I was very apprehensive about a couple of things prior to seeing Beauty & the Beast, the first was Emma Watson playing Belle and the other was Lafou also how the songs would flow but within 1-2 minutes of the film I was at ease and even brought tears to my eyes they captured it almost perfectly. Emma Watson Didn't disappoint me nor did the Lafou character I even enjoyed both. The show stealers though for me were Gaston & The Beast portrayed by Luke Evans & Dan Stevens. I even thought 2hrs 10 minutes ish was a long running time but it flowed along brilliantly and I was amazed at how beautifully the film was filmed from scene to scene. Better than the classic original? no! but almost a like for like remake into a live action animated film."

","Beauty and the Beast is, was and always will be my favorite off all Disney movies (concidering the princess theme). This movie was good, not perfect but good. I read many posts about how bad this movie was but lets not forget that a movie is not only its actors but all in union. Acting 7.5 ,Music 9.5 ,Singing 7, Directing 7, Costumes 10+, Sets 10+ My final verdict is 7. <br/><br/>I liked it but yet just in moments I felt that I was going to be thrilled like the original one I did not, but this movie was not the original one. It was a remake,a remake to dazzle the new generations not us, it was created to have as a main audience children not 25+ people and it was good enough to do that.Also do not forget that in this one Disney decided to give a proper representation of the time line that these event happened and to say the truth that was not one of the most beautiful eras considering clothing,hair etc. also the put information about to many questions had been left unanswered all these years(something new of the most <br/><br/>of us and unfamiliar). Emma's singing and the era that the story took place were the thinks that thought me off. In general the movie is perfect remake of the original considering the story and the musical essence of the music. <br/><br/>It was good movie better than any other I have seen the last hole year.I would like to see this over and over again than seeing Batman Vs Superman or Suicide Squade again.....

"rcjsheets","9","2","10","17 March 2017"," A really good film overall
","For people who want something reworked and entirely new, I didn't think this was it. But if you want to see a human adaptation of the classic, I think that this is a very good version. I thought it was a great movie. There are a few little twists and turns that change it up just enough to keep you wondering. As for La Fou and the concerns that some have had about the film. Truth is, the movie does not make him 'flaming' and there are very subtle, and very few, references to his or any characters sexuality. I saw this movie with a few moms and the scene that no one had seen yet, but had the fit about, could easily be passed off as something else. We even heard a child of about 8 years old ask her mother after the movie, ""So what was the thing that everyone was all flipping out about?"" If you want to sing along (in your head) and tap your feet, this is a good movie."
"RLTerry1","Null","2","10","17 March 2017"," Beautiful! BUT...Consistently Tries to Validate Itself...Ultimately an Unnecessary Remake
","Prepare yourself for ""a tale as old as time"" that is ultimately better told through its animated counterpart. Director Bill Condon's live-action remake of Beauty and the Beast, the first animated film nominated for Best Picture at the (1992) Academy Awards, is an extravagant display of visual effects and digital imagery necessary to animate a live-action motion picture. Essentially, he took an animated movie, made it live-action, just to make it animated again. Sure, this new version of the ""song as old as rhyme"" can certainly stand on its own and is demonstrably well-directed, but 2017's Beauty and the Beast largely comes across as unnecessary. In terms of the storytelling (or diegesis), the film's effort to nearly shot-for-shot translate the most memorable parts of the film from animation to live-action pays off nicely! It's when the film tries to be different that it falls short in its delivery. You may find yourself exhausted and over-stimulated by the constant waves of computer-animated figures in a live-action world. Oh yeah, you'll likely miss hearing the legendary Angela Lansbury as the iconic Mrs. Potts.<br/><br/>Can this film stand on its own? Sure. There is no question in that. Moreover, is it enjoyable and magical? That, it is. But when most of the campaign, leading up to the highly anticipated release, was primarily built upon how similar the live-action film would be to its animated counterpart, therein a problem arises. Because most people going into the movie will have seen the animated version, Broadway show, or even the show at Disney's Hollywood Studios (which, in full disclosure, is a show that I worked when I was a Cast Member at Walt Disney World), you are predisposed to looking for and eagerly awaiting the nostalgic references and memories. And there is nothing wrong with that. In fact, I was looking forward to reliving the experience of when I first saw the animated movie. For the most part, if you are like me, then you will be pleased with the live-action translation–truly. However, it's when the live-action version departs from or adds in material not found or referenced in the animated classic that you may be disappointed or simply ask ""why?"" You may find yourself wondering why was a live-action remake even necessary?<br/><br/>One of the most memorable elements of Disney's Beauty and the Beast (1991) is the music! Still to this day, millions of people love hearing the classic music and lyrics by Alan Menken and Howard Ashman. Both the Beauty and the Beast and Be Our Guest can be heard as part of other shows at Walt Disney World and of course are included in the stage show at Hollywood Studios. Fortunately, the most iconic songs from the animated version are largely untouched; however, with a couple of the songs, there are breaks for diegetic dancing, fighting, or other material that essentially interrupts the organic flow of the music from the buildup to the climax and denouement. Furthermore, here's something quite interesting and odd: the song ""Human Again"" was written for but deleted when it originally hit theatres in 1991. It was, however, added back in for the Broadway show and in the 2010 (and Diamond Edition) re-release of the movie. Although it was seen as important enough to include in the Broadway show and add back into the animated version, it is conspicuously missing from the live-action remake.<br/><br/>Okay, now for the white elephant in the room: Josh Gad's Lefou. Unless you have been completely disconnected from social media and the news, you've undoubtedly heard or read about the first ever Disney ""gay moment"" in this film. Suffice it to say, the whole thing has been blown way out of proportion. In fact, more attention is likely being paid to Lefou now than had the story never grown to the size of Gaston's ego. For the most part, the subtext and subtitles of Lefou's are largely just that–subtle–unless you are looking for them. But, in doing that, you may miss some of the more important and impressive parts of the movie. Moreover, there is nothing in Lefou's actions that come across as offensive or obnoxious. Before audiences begin accusing Disney of pushing their ideals on those eager to attend this film, it is likely that the entertainment and media giant is simply delivering what audiences already expect or want. As a film and media professor, I can tell you that by in large, media simply delivers what audiences and investors are telling them to produce–not the other way around. Looking back at the animated film, it is pretty obvious that Lefou has a thing for Gaston anyway. Although most of the hints at his sexual orientation are more-or-less winks or nods at the audience (winks or nods that you have to be looking for), there is a moment that is a trifle more obvious at the end of the film. Diegetically, there is nothing bizarre about Lefou's behavior and it suits his character well.<br/><br/>Prepare to be whisked away to an enchanted castle in a remote part of France. So remote is this province in France, that most everyone speaks with a British accent. Bill Condon's film will take you back to when you first saw this magical tale of falling in love with someone based upon what's on the inside and not allowing a beastly outward appearance to detract from the gentle soul. Relive the music that you may still listen to in the car or eagerly look forward to when visiting the Disney Parks and Resorts. Ultimately, this film may not capture the magic of the original for you, but there is a lot to enjoy! Looking for a great date movie this weekend, then this is definitely it! Hopefully a side effect of this film may remind producers and audiences that some stories are better suited for an animated motion picture."
"gogarrett","8","2","10","17 March 2017"," Very nice remake of 1991 animated classic
","The biggest impression from seeing this remake was ""Wow, it's just like the 1991 animated movie!"" The biggest changes are that both Beauty and the Beast are given back stories about their parents, you glean more about the enchantress that cast the spell, and there are a few character changes that are very slight, including a Wardrobe with a more amazing singing voice than Jo Ann Worley who has an unlikely hookup with the Cadenza played by-over-the top Stanley Tucci. Most of the music is the same, with different voices of course. It's all very nice, but leaves you yearning for the original singers nonetheless, especially Angela Lansbury as Mrs. Potts and Jerry Obach as Lumiere. Emma Thompson makes a fine Mrs Potts, but it is hard to replace Angela Lansbury.<br/><br/>Kevin Kline inevitably made the part of Maurice, Belle's father, more engaging and memorable. Kudos to Luke Evans Gaston and Josh Gad's LeFou. They really let loose to actually become their animated over-the-top counterparts. The twist on LeFou's character at the end made perfect sense!<br/><br/>There are a couple songs I don't remember from the original, perhaps because they are less memorable altogether? At the end is a powerful rendition of ""Evermore"" where I was thinking that the Beast, played by Dan Stevens, has a much better singing voice than I thought. Then the credits rolled by and I saw that song was by Josh Grogan. Very, very nice! <br/><br/>Go see this movie. Then you will also want to watch the 1991 version again I bet."
"greenkoala-04895","7","2","10","17 March 2017"," A great movie but wasn't as good as I thought
","Beauty and the Beast was my favorite childhood movie so I was super excited to see the live action adaptation starring Emma Watson. It didn't live up to my expectations but I think it's only because I love the original so much. There were a lot of added details that I enjoyed but I found myself shaking my head during some scenes. I liked how it was modernized and the costumes were pretty good. The CGI of the castle servants were a little weird to me but I didn't think the beast's animations were that bad. The transformation scene honestly let me down. The scene in he original is amazing so I expected the live action to be as amazing, if not better. I know there's only so much you can do in a live action movie but I was still expecting more. Still overall a great movie."

But overall good movie and hope diner keeps up the good work on these remake of animated classic movies."
"barbagvido","10","2","11","28 April 2017"," I didn't want it to end.
","Beauty and the Beast is the fourth of the live- action Disney remakes after Maleficent (2014), Cinderella (2015) and The Jungle Book (2016). So far, I thought they were okay, but none of them impressed me. This one, however, did.<br/><br/>The original might be my favorite Disney animated movie. I'm not sure, but definitely in the top 5. But I do have some sort of a connection with that one and when you go analyzing it has a lot of deeper and important messages. Like all Disney animated movies, the original was magical and I wondered if it would translate well on live-action. The previous three live-action remakes were alright, but they took away so many details that made the original so great in order to make it more realistic. But who cares about realistic in a fairy tale? Thankfully, this one kept the magic of the original and expanded the whole story in order to fill in some plot holes and it worked very well. I wasn't bored for a second. In fact, I just didn't want it to end. I was sucked into this beautiful, magical story and to this day I can't stop thinking about it. Especially since this story is so relate-able to me (I relate to Belle so, so much and I'm probably not the only one). I just got sucked into the magic and I never let it go. And the musical numbers only added fuel to the magic.<br/><br/>The actors really got into their roles. I was really happy to see Emma Watson in this role since she's pretty much the heroine of my childhood (I grew up with Harry Potter) and I think she did a really good job. Dan Stevens is also very good as Beast and I liked how they gave him a sarcastic side. But the one who truly steals the spotlight is Luke Evans as the main villain Gaston. He's disgusting and fabulous at the same time and I'm sure they couldn't cast a better actor for that role. Everyone is so into it, and it's wonderful to finally see that much heart put into a movie. CGI might not always be believable but that doesn't make the movie any less gorgeous. The story is well expanded. They kept to the story of the original while adding something new to it.<br/><br/>All in all, I absolutely adore this movie and I'd even say that it's better than the original. There were a few times that I was close to tears of joy and I left with a big, big smile on my face. I will definitely be coming back to this one over and over again and I recommend this to everyone. I haven't felt this much magic in a movie since Harry Potter ended."

I had a massive smile on my face the whole time, and was exhilarated by most of the song and dance numbers.Be my guest was particularly spectacular!! The magic is not lost at all, in fact the back story is fleshed out and adds to the film. The characters are fabulous and very well cast. Emma Watson i thought​ was good but not spectacular, but didn't distract from the magic at all. Gaston i loved, was very sinister. <br/><br/>Please go see this film with the original in mind but not expecting it to be exactly like the original because that's ridiculous and not possible. The original is magical for what it is, but cinema moves on and this is a beautiful retelling of the story. No Disney film will ever be the same as the original but that's not the point. This is beautiful and magical and made me feel the same as watching the original and you can't say much better than that! <br/><br/>I suspect most people seeing this film at cinema will not remember most of it, like me, but i intend to acquire a copy as soon as legally possible, and rewatch. <br/><br/>Go watch this film!!

What possible reason is there for disliking in this enchanting and inspiring movie? It is appropriate for children who are 8+ as there is a scene where an old man is bound in ropes, one of a pack of snarling wolves attempting to kill belle, the beast, and her father, a flashback of Belle's mother dying of a disease, and the beast getting scratched by the wolves, plus a few scenes of 3 couples kissing.

""Not a bit of him's scraggly or scrawny"" didn't really fit him. And 3. Josh Gad's LeFou seemed too gay. At many points, I found myself thinking ""Was that really necessary?""

","This is a live action film (incorporating CGI animation), a remake of a classic with some tweaks here and there to make it a little more modern. I doubt whether anyone is unfamiliar with the plot (but just in case) here a summary  <br/><br/>The main protagonist is a very handsome but selfish prince, who is 'ugly on the inside'. A beggar woman comes to the castle and offers the prince a rose, and asks for shelter, she is turned away and laughed at, she decides there is no love in the prince's heart. She is angry and reveals herself to be a witch, she casts a spell on the Prince and his staff making him into the 'ugly on the outside' Beast. The staff are all turned into pieces of furniture and antiques etc. They will all stay that way forever until someone declares their love for the Beast before the last petal of the rose falls.(Don't worry it all works out in the end)<br/><br/>The actors have all been perfectly cast. <br/><br/>Belle is Emma Watson, the 'bookish' feminist, her character is an anti-princess and very close to her Hermione character from Harry Potter, though not a great singer.<br/><br/>The Beast is Dan Stephens, he is excellent and has a great singing voice.<br/><br/>Gaston is Luke Evans, he is big and very bold, he has great charisma but is very egotistical.<br/><br/>Gaston's manservant is Josh Gad, he appears to be overly familiar with Gaston, but not in an overbearing way. This is in a similar way that Smithers, from the Simpsons, is with Mr Burns.<br/><br/>Parents need to be careful if they have younger children, the Beast character might be a little scary for a younger audience, the wolf attack scene definitely might be a little too scary.<br/><br/>The film will definitely engage with a '20 something' viewer (especially a girl) who will have loved the original animated version.<br/><br/>I will definitely view again and recommend this film."

The alarmist incorrect warning here is merely that, alarmist and incorrect.<br/><br/>As for the movie content itself it was fantastic unless you were hoping for an absolute carbon copy with no changes to actors or content or song. If you were expecting a clone, you will not be happy.<br/><br/>Thankfully I was looking forward to an homage with enough original tweaks to make it interesting while being familiar but also a little new.

","Though there is no denying that the live-action remake of Disney's 1991 animation classic of the same name is gorgeous to look at, thanks to its extravagant production design, radiant camerawork & exquisite costumes, the film still fails to emulate the dazzling quality & magical flair of the original, and is also unable to transport us to its enchanting world.<br/><br/>Directed by Bill Condon, this latest adaptation follows the original faithfully yet never for once manages to capture the beauty & simplicity of its story. Bloated, overlong & ruined by superficiality in nearly every aspect, this visually arresting yet narratively hollow remake brings nothing new to the table. And apart from the nostalgic connection, it's got nothing going for it.<br/><br/>The musical numbers don't have the same effect in the live-action scenario, the extra minutes add nothing to the experience, its eye-candy moments of spectacle are missing the charm required to deliver the desired result, and the supporting characters are poorly sketched. Emma Watson is surprisingly amongst the few positives about this film and her chemistry with Dan Stevens has a certain warmth to it as well.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Beauty and the Beast is inferior to the 1991 musical romance fantasy in every way or shape or form but Condon's reiteration has an authentic touch & sweet vibe to it that prevents it from being a total disaster. However, the film still fails to offer a valid reason for its existence, just like every other Disney's live-action remake of their beloved classics. It might appease the newcomers but won't garner a similar reception from most die-hard fans of the original masterpiece."

","This was the most hyped of Disney's live-action remakes thus far, and eventually I caved. Why not try it, at least? Sadly, I barely lasted a couple of minutes, for two reasons. The first one is that the sets look fake. Everything is grandiose, rococo, oversaturated, stiff and overly symmetrical and ""theoretical."" I can suspend such disbelief in a theatrical setting, but not on screen.<br/><br/>The second reason, as you may have guessed, is Emma Watson. You can tick off the number of problems with her performance:<br/><br/><ul><li>She can't sing. She just CAN'T. She can carry a tune because she was taught to do so specifically for the film, but she has absolutely no natural musical talent, no seductive sweetness. No way could I listen to this for two hours.</li><li>There's no verisimilitude to her acting. She's overly expressive; her emotions are exaggerated; her accentuation is artificial. But it's not just her: pretty much everyone on screen has the same annoying affectation. Again, this might work if they were in the Broadway musical. It fails, here.</li><li>She doesn't exactly have a pretty face. Sorry to be superficial, but the title is 'BEAUTY and the Beast' and she's playing a character named ""Beauty."" There's *just* no excuse for this one.</li></ul><br/><br/>As one forum poster said shortly before the initial release, the concept was clearly to sell the public tickets to ""Come and see Hermione play Belle!"" and it worked. She was clearly miscast, though, even for the Broadway musical, which everyone on screen seems to think they were playing in.<br/><br/>I obviously can't comment on the actual dramatic storyline (though I did catch glimpses of obvious anachronisms such as black peasant girls alongside white counterparts in 17th-century France) but from what I've heard it's an (overly) ""extended"" version of the 1991 animated film, which for all its faults was at least highly entertaining. If they had focused on replicating the original story in live-action without any addendums they might have thought to pay attention to casting and directing. It wouldn't have been easy to reproduce the whimsical idiosyncratic fun of a musical project now so widely known, but with appropriate talent and enough willpower it shouldn't have been impossible, either.<br/><br/>As it is they seem to have been determined to create something so grandiose that they not only allowed theatrical affect: they also encouraged it. I actually think a YouTube video of the Broadway musical would be easier to get through. Heck, I'd go for a high school performance: at least the medium would leave no subconscious expectations to disappoint.<br/><br/>I give it a very generous two starts for WANTING to look good and having some vague idea of what that might be in theory."

","I would like to give 7.5 but I'll round it up to 8. Okay, this movie is beautiful to look at and the singing was great. The beast gets his own song which is my favorite out of all the musical scores. However...I don't think Emma Watson gave this her all. There are scenes were she just gives a lifeless smile, some of her dialogue seems empty and the relationship between her and the beast seems forced, especially from her side. My other issue is that there's some back story about her that was honestly not needed to enhance her character or her father's character at all so for me it was a waste of time that could have been better used to create a deeper relationship between her and the beast. In the animated film, their relationship is richer and Belle's character is full of life, full of hope and spontaneity. But for some reason Emma was a little bore in this, she had much more spunk as Hermonie but maybe Belle was just not her character? Overall kids enjoyed it, great singing, the Beast was great I think his backstory did add a plus to the film and it's certainly a beautiful film. Not to mention the many laughs between Gatson and Lefou. Hopefully next time Disney picks a better fit for the main heroine."

","""When we return to the village, you will marry me. And the Beast's head will hang on our wall!"" <br/><br/>I'm really not ashamed to admit that I'm always looking forward to watch a live-action rendition of a Disney cartoon. We've seen a few of those already passing by. One more successful than the other. Or better, one I liked more than the other. ""Maleficent"", ""The BFG"" and especially ""The Jungle Book"" were, in my view, gorgeous adaptations. I was less enthusiastic about ""Alice in Wonderland"". And when you read which cartoons Disney is going to make a live-action movie of, there's still a lot of fun waiting for us. And when you read which cartoons Disney is going to make a live-action movie off, there's still a lot of fun waiting for us. Brace yourself! These are coming our way : ""The Lion King"", ""The Little Mermaid"", ""Snow White"", ""Dumbo"" and ""Pinocchio"". My expectations regarding ""Beauty and the Beast"" were high. But they weren't met fully. Despite the many reports about the gross income at the worldwide box office (more than $ 1 billion), I wasn't as enthusiast as with ""The Jungle book"".<br/><br/>Let me start again with the best parts. This time it's not the main roles that deserve the most praise. No, the supporting roles do. They were simply beautiful. Humorous, lively and fascinating to watch. First of all, the enchanted household objects from the castle. Cogsworth (Ian McKellen), Lumière (Ewan McGregor), Mrs. Pott (Emma Thompson), Chip (Nathan Mack), Madame Wardrobe (Audra McDonald) and Maestro Cadenza (Stanley Tucci) are a grab-bag of props and despite the fact that they are graphic creations, they really look lifelike. Not only the design is fairy-like. The voices of the actors also provide additional magic.<br/><br/>And then you have the odd couple Gaston (Luke Evans) and Lefou (Josh Gad) who can easily compete with the legendary duo Laurel and Hardy. Luke Evans was fantastic as the narcissistic Gaston who uses every moment to praise himself and who's always stroking his own ego. An egoist who is not only strong, handsome and feels superior, but also who thinks it's self-evident that everybody dances to his tune. And of course he assumes Belle will marry him blindly. Lefou on the other hand is the clumsy, tractable servant who constantly runs after Gaston and agrees with him all the time (only in the end there's some doubt). Probably the only character people made a lot of fuss about in advance. And all that because of his so-called gayish behavior. Well, there'll always be nitpickers. Terribly exaggerated in my opinion. Not even worth mentioning.<br/><br/>In general the story is the same as the one told in the 1991 cartoon. There are a few adjustments and additions. I'm not such an expert when it comes to this fairy tale, but I really can't remember there was an explanation about the death of Belle's mother. And in fact, I wonder if this was a valuable addition anyway. On the other hand, much attention has been paid to the design. The palace of the beast looks phenomenal. A giant building full of stately ornaments and impressive rooms and halls where Rococo is blended with other European styles. The appearance reminded me of my visit to Neuschwanstein Castle when I was young. The styling applied in this contemporary version of a classic Disney looks pretty okay you can say.<br/><br/>So, which were the parts I wasn't happy about? The first one has to do with personal preferences and shouldn't really be seen as something negative. I thoroughly hate musicals. Voila, I've outed myself. As soon as the first song has finished (usually quite soon at the beginning of the film), I have trouble concentrating on the actual story itself. I find myself anxiously waiting for the next damn song to begin (And every void, insignificant event is enough to get everybody singing in a musical) . Perhaps the plethora of musicals I've watched in the weekend during my youth, is the cause of this phobia. There wasn't Saturday without a ""Busby Berkeley""-like musical being broadcasted again. Now I have to admit that the song ""Be our guest"" was put together well. A thrilling spectacle. But my hate for musicals will always stay. What disappointed me the most was the graphic design of the beast (Dan Stevens). Especially the famous scene with Belle (Emma Watson) in her impressive, yellow dress dancing through a giant ballroom in the arms of the beast, wasn't so great. Here you could clearly see the beast was a computer generated character.<br/><br/>""Beauty and the beast"" is magical, detailed and fascinating. A must see for anyone who's a major fan of Disneyfilms. Even Emma Watson was brilliant in my opinion and the appropriate person to play the lovely, cute Belle. And if she indeed sang all these songs herself (even if sophisticated sound techniques were used to make it sound even better), then she's also a talented singer. Despite some personal remarks, this is also a successful recasting of the classic version. Only the magic of ""The Jungle Book"" overwhelmed me more when I saw it. What the heck, on to the next Disney movie as soon as possible please! <br/><br/>More reviews here : http://bit.ly/2qtGQoc"
"slicedbread117","7","1","4","22 June 2017"," Rekindling Magic is Harder Than it Looks
","One could argue Beauty and the Beast is Disney's most beloved property of all-time. The 1991 animated classic is legendary, with its iconic score and captivating story becoming a staple in pop culture. It's a risky move to slap a remake onto such a profound piece of movie history, but, outside of a few hard bumps in the road, the risk of Beauty and the Beast (B&B) seems to be worth the reward.<br/><br/>Right out of the gate, most remakes are going to be scrutinized for its ability to walk the thin line of honoring the original story, while incorporating new, fresh narrative details. It's no easy task to accomplish. We hear constantly how remakes will honor the original while bringing new ideas to the table, and quite often, it doesn't pan out. Beauty and the Beast is not so much an exception to that history, more than it's acceptable. The age-old tale of B&B is still undoubtedly the main story focus in the modern take, but sprinkles of new plot structure weave through the film, for better or for worse. The 129 min run time topples over the original's 84 min, adding extra scenes, mainly in the first act, to try and liven the character development of some of the film's lesser known characters outside of Belle and the Beast. This is where I felt the film was at its weakest, however. Sure we need introduction to the main story, setting and characters, but it's not until Belle is actually in the Beast's castle that the movie starts to become more interesting. Once we're in the castle, focusing on Belle, the Beast and the objects occupying it, the movie picks up, becomes more intriguing and more endearing. The overall pacing can be described as OK. B&B struggles to tell a rock solid three-act story like it's 1991 counterpart, but if you can get past the added run time, the classic Beauty and the Beast tale is still oh-so-charming.<br/><br/>The '91 original was a pioneer in animation, boasting one of the more recognizable camera shots in all of animated film history during the ballroom scene. 2017 brings an entire new world of animation and CGI, and whether you like it or not, B&B utilizes it to the extreme. The budget was a clear green light for massive CG visuals, most notably the Beast himself whose design, while at first a little unappealing, eventually grows on you. But the heavy dose of CGI littered throughout the film is tough to accept, even though it is a remake of a fully animated film. I have no problem with how the SFX looked, the movie was visually wonderful, but the sheer amount of it is hard to ignore throughout the entirety of the film.<br/><br/>On the audible side, the iconic B&B score was on full display here. I'll get into more detail about that shortly, so for now, I'll say that the excitement and charm of the score is present, but not always quite as enthralling as the original. The mixing is often unbalanced during the musical numbers boasting numerous people, and it's undeniably hard to recapture the pure wonder of Angela Lansbury's original performance of ""Tale as Old as Time"", but B&B does the song enough justice with Emma Thompson's performance. The big budget brings assumptions to how well the film will look and sound, and it honestly looks and sounds just great. But there are inconsistencies that hold B&B back from getting to the level of the original. <br/><br/>There's been mixed feelings towards the casting choices for the film, namely mega-star Emma Watson in the lead role as Belle. The bulk of the negativity towards Watson seemed to be in her inability to sing at the professional level you'd expect from a movie such as B&B. While I'll admit it's true that the vocal performances from Watson, along with several other actors, are weak for the standard Disney set in 1991, the overall performance given by the main cast was good enough to warrant the stamp of approval. Watson is solid in the lead role, while Dan Stevens does his best with the screen time he was given as Beast. My stand outs, however, have to go to Ian McKellen and Ewan McGregor as Cogsworth and Lumiere respectively. While their time on screen is also too limited, their chemistry was spot on, providing the perfect comedic relief and giving great performances during the famous number, ""Be Our Guest"". I also enjoyed Luke Evans as the main antagonist, Gaston, but not so much his more-focused-on partner, LeFou, played by the over-hyped Josh Gad. The change in LeFou's character was welcome in the film, but it was the forced screen time and dialogue for the character that just took too much away from what was important to the film's story.<br/><br/>Disney captured lightning in a bottle in 1991 with the original, now legendary Beauty and the Beast. It's not fair, or maybe not possible, to bash it's remake, seeing how the films are similar on many grounds. I had many moments enjoying B&B and would happily watch it again. The story was close enough to the original to pass as enjoyable. The acting, while hurting in the vocal department, was splendid and the chemistry between certain characters was delightful. What B&B lacks is the simplicity of its predecessor. The added story elements, which created the longer run time, and CG- heavy atmosphere leave a dent in the crafting of the film's 'soul', if you will. The musical score just couldn't hold up to the original, and that is such an enormous part of what makes B&B so special. Beauty and the Beast tries hard, maybe too hard, to stand out from the original film, creating a respectable, often enjoyable remake of a iconic film, but even so, comes nowhere near the level of what was seen in 1991.<br/><br/>7/10"

","Beauty and the beast is one of my favorite Disney films and I was very excited for this to come out. However after looking at the trailers and seeing the animation it was disappointing. I think Emma Watson as Belle was a good choice and the actress planned it well. However the story was let down by different plot points in the movie. The songs that was added and the new characters didn't move the story along."

CGI and technology has given a new life to movies, especially to Fairy Tales. But remaking one tale over and over again makes the story boring. Maleficent was the one which was not only different but too damn good. This on the other hand, well not that good honestly. Ema Watson has done a good job but the rest were just pushing themselves too hard. Dan Stevens should have opted for Gatson and Luke Evans should have played the beast. Lets say this is an Era when a beautiful guy cant be the hero of the day it requires more manly look. Josh Gad, such a stupid role his played. I know he would curse for doing it for the rest of his life. In short awsomely boring and with too much unnecessary music and the end is too cheesy."

","As a fan of the original Disney film (Personally I feel it's their masterpiece) I was taken aback to the fact that a recent version was in the making. Still excited I had high hopes for the film. Most of was shattered in the first 10 minutes. Campy acting with badly performed singing starts off a long journey holding hands with some of the worst CGI Hollywood have managed to but to screen in ages. This movie is the disappoint.<br/><br/>When the prince refuses the rose from stranger and stranger turn to fairy, she transforms him into a monstrous beast and his servants into household objects, and erases the castle from the memories of their loved ones. She casts a spell on the rose and warns the prince that, unless he learns to love another and earn their love in return before the last petal falls, he and his servants will lose their humanity forever.<br/><br/>Lost in the forest, Belle's father Maurice seeks refuge in the Beast's castle, but the Beast imprisons him for stealing a rose. Belle ventures out in search for him and finds him locked in the castle dungeon. The Beast agrees to let her take Maurice's place (her father place).<br/><br/>Belle befriends the castle's servants, who treat her to a spectacular dinner. When she wanders into the forbidden west wing and finds the rose, the Beast, enraged, scares her into the woods. She is cornered by wolves, but the Beast rescues her and is injured in the process. A friendship develops as Belle nurses his wounds. The Beast shows Belle a gift from the enchantress, a book that transports readers wherever they want. Belle uses it to visit her childhood home in Paris, where she discovers a plague doctor mask. Belle realizes that she and her father were forced to leave her mother's deathbed because of her mother succumbed to the plague. Bell's father come back to village to seek the help, but no one believe him. Gaston sees rescuing Belle as an opportunity to win her hand in marriage and agrees to help Maurice. However, when Gaston go with Bell's father to forest, he loses temper because bell's father forgot the way to beast castle; Gaston then abandons him to the wolves. Maurice is rescued by a beggar, but when he tells the townsfolk of Gaston's crime, Gaston convinces them to send him to an insane asylum. After sharing a romantic dance with the Beast, Belle discovers her father's predicament using a magic mirror. The Beast releases her to save Maurice, giving her the mirror to remember him with. At Villeneuve, Belle proves Maurice's sanity by revealing the Beast in the mirror to the townsfolk. Realizing that Belle loves the Beast, Gaston has her thrown into the asylum carriage with her father and rallies the villagers to follow him to the castle to slay the Beast. Maurice and Belle escape and Belle rushes back to the castle.<br/><br/>During the battle, Gaston abandons his companion LeFou, who sides with the servants to fend off the villagers. Gaston attacks the Beast in his tower, who is too depressed to fight back, but regains his will upon seeing Belle return. He spares Gaston's life before reuniting with Belle. However, Gaston shoots the Beast from a bridge, but it collapses when the castle crumbles and he falls to his death. The Beast dies as the last petal falls and the servants become inanimate. When Belle tearfully professes her love to him, Agathe reveals herself as the enchantress and undoes the curse, repairing the crumbling castle and restoring the Beast's and servants' human forms and the villagers' memories. The Prince and Belle host a ball for the kingdom, where they dance happily."
"arthurmustafa-19399","4","1","4","21 May 2017"," So very disappointing
","This movie shines through it's lack of credibility, humor and especially passion. If you want to destroy a movie's passion, put Emma Watson in it! She's like a petite female robot that acts like she is still 10 years old. The others are no better! I guess it's the director's fault here. Simply no vision at all about how this movie should be!"
"johnplocar","5","1","4","17 May 2017"," It's the original animated movie...just higher definition of the same thing again.
","The magical 1991 animated tale is being told again, only this time in 'live-action'. The movie stars Emma Watson as Belle who finds herself imprisoned by a beastly creature in a cursed castle (Dan Stevens). The two obviously at first start out at odds, but over time learn to look past their differences and become fond of one another to the point where they may have achieved a love that could break the spell over the castle and everyone who inhabits it.<br/><br/>I didn't like it... I think the movie itself is fine. There really isn't that much wrong with the actual picture; it's well made, well directed, looks pretty, acted fine, songs (for the most part) are the same and decent, it has a few good laughs, the CGI is mostly done alright. My real gripes about this movie is that, aside from approximately 15 minutes worth of material, it is exactly the same as the 1991 animated movie of the same name. It is as close as a movie can get to being a 'shot-for-shot' remake without reaching quite to the extent of Gus Van Sant's ""Psycho"". There isn't any real originality to this movie, it rips off every single scene, all the songs and lines of dialog from the original and makes it ""live- action"", which even then it's not really live-action since the majority of the film is done with CGI. Granted, a lot of the CGI looks fine, but some of it looked a little...creepy. <br/><br/>Anyways, I can't say that it's a bad film but that is only because it follows the original so closely so of course it isn't bad. But if I want to watch the exact same movie again then I'll pop in the 1991 movie that feels way more genuine than this remake. I was able to feel way more of the enchantment and charm of the cartoon than I was with this movie. With this movie, all I was able to feel was the cynical attitude of the producers basically saying ""Well, if we make the exact same movie again then we don't have to think up anything new and the audiences will be happy because they're seeing the same movie all over again that they could easily watch at home but this time they have to give us money for it...Genius!"" That's what this movie feels like, it's lazy on the part of the writers and producers to make this movie because they already had the movie made for them once before, all they had to do was copy and paste. Yeah, there is a few different scenes and songs scattered around but they either stick out like a sore thumb or don't make any difference to the overall story anyways so it became pointless. This whole remake's existence is pointless because it's already been done before and done way better. It's a manufactured, lifeless product rather than an endearing and magical love story like before.<br/><br/>I love the original, I really do. And I can see why people would like this movie; like I said before, it's not a bad film, I just have a problem with studios being so lazy that they don't even bother taking the time to come up with a new or different adaptation of the material. They'd rather ride the success of the original movie by doing the same thing again, and it worked. And I understand that this is completely subjective, so if that doesn't bother you then fine. Personally, I'm under the opinion that if a remake isn't doing something in order to justify its reasons for existing then it's pointless. If a remake is only going to do exactly what the original movie did then I'll just watch the original instead. Now if this movie tried putting a different spin on things, or expanded much more on the characters, maybe taking a unique direction, changing things up in the story that possibly could play on expectations; then I would see a reason for this movie being made, however as it is, it's a lesser and longer version of a classic Disney masterpiece. <br/><br/>I know that I've been extremely harsh on the movie, but the movie itself really is fine. Technically speaking, there isn't that much about it that's necessarily bad. Emma Watson does fine in the role of Belle, although I don't think she has a particularly strong singing voice. Dan Stevens I already just naturally like, he has a good on screen presence in about everything I've seen him in and he does well as the Beast. Kevin Kline I always love to see in movies, besides ""Bob's Burgers"" I don't get to see him in much so I'm glad that he played Maurice since he can balance kooky and lovable so easily. Luke Evans and Josh Gad as Gaston and LeFou were pretty great actually. They were a big reason why I laughed as much as I did while watching the movie. <br/><br/>Moving on. The songs from the original are still catchy and charming, the new songs I honestly can't remember what they sounded like; I remember where they pop up in the story, but not so much their melodies or lyrics...so I guess they're...fine? Maybe? The movie looks very pretty; the set designs and costumes are visually interesting, the special effects are mainly done well, and there are some decently shot sequences. So I say if you end up watching this, you'll probably have a good time with it and it's fine to show to your kids for sure. If and when I have kids though, the remake won't be the first thing I show them. It will be the animated film and the remake will probably never make it into my movie collection so...woops...I guess they won't get the privilege of seeing that one...oh no"

","***SPOILERS FOR THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW THE STORY***<br/><br/>CASTING<br/><br/>I liked Emma Watson as Belle, she's a fine actress and a good source of eye candy and was well cast in that role.  Belle's father, on the other hand, played by Kevin Kline, was by far the weakest link in the cast.  He was a poor decision to play that part and I don't think his character was written very well either.  The actor who portrayed Gaston was absolutely wonderful, and although I don't care for that character in the animated version, I really enjoyed him in this movie.  However, as much as I like Josh Gad I don't think he was a very good choice to play LaFou.  Along with not being so well written I thought LaFou was kinda cringey in some scenes.<br/><br/>PLOT<br/><br/>I'm happy to say that the live action movie fixed most, if not all, of the plot issues I hold against the animated feature.  For example, instead of having the beast begin hitting on Belle as soon as he takes her prisoner it is now portrayed as a secret collaboration by the servants to get their master together with Belle, one which the beast initially resists.  This works SOOO much better, imo.  However, many of the scenes are woefully underdeveloped.  The wolf attack scene, for example.  The beast gets a couple of bites and we're supposed to believe he's incapacitated for days?  And the scene where Belle chooses to take the place of her father was not done well.  It's a critical plot point but they seem to rush through it.  Most egregious of these errors, though, is the handling of the climax.  When the last rose petal falls and Belle thinks the beast is dead, we as the audience are caught up in the emotion of it all.  She kneels down next to him and then the camera cuts to show what's going on in the rest of the castle.  By the time they get back to Belle and the fallen beast my emotional investment in the scene had waned considerably.  It's a travesty and a sign of poor direction or scriptwriting or both.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION<br/><br/>I did enjoy the film, warts and all, and I like it better than the animated version, however, I think it was a real missed opportunity.  It could have been magnificent in the hands of better filmmakers."

I've always loved the original animated version of this movie and my daughter and I were looking forward to this live action version with Emma but I have to say I thought it was just okay."

","Not long ago while reviewing Moana, I wrote that, love them or hate them, Disney studios will always be Disney. Professional to the very last detail, but very shallow, and putting each and every story they treat through their well oiled machine. <br/><br/>I don't agree with those saying the CGI are below par, or simply creepy. I think they were expecting the old hand painted Disney magic, and when seeing their old characters in CGI were shocked by the outcome. I also think the acting was first class all the way through. I didn't even mind the songs too much. They always get in the way of the story, they're always way over the top, but I guess I got used to them. <br/><br/>On the other hand I do have an issue with the story itself. It does follow the old Disney version almost to the letter. That's because Disney studios believe that their version should be the only one. It's not such a big problem when the source material is well known and available to all those interested, like the stories of the bible or the Greek myths, I'm also willing to forgive these liberties with lesser known myths, but when they do it to literary masterpieces I'm not so understanding. I think the original Mary Poppins novel is so much better than what they made it, it's plain shame. I didn't like what they did with Peter Pan and Winnie the Pooh, but at least they did come close to the intended spirit of the original. They failed badly here, because they insisted on following their own footsteps. Have a look at the 1946 French B&W version and you'll understand what a story you're missing in this version.<br/><br/>So they had the opportunity to remake it as a real masterpiece, they chose to stick to their own old version instead. It's just plain shame even if it's not a real surprise."

","Since I knew about this production I was anxious of seeing it. Especially after watching ""The Jungle Book"", which impressed me a lot because of the incredible special effects. I had very high expectations about this movie. Even tho I loved the movie there were some details that I didn't like that much and some others that in my opinion were very clever because helped getting in the mood of this fairy tale and the made it a little bit more ""real"". But, before getting into that, I would like to talk about one of the topics of the film which is the relationships between characters. I liked that in this film you can see different types of relationships (mother and son, best friends, lovers...) that could perfectly represent relations of your daily life. In my case this made me think about my friend and family. What I most liked about the movie were the scenery, which I found charming; the costumes, some of them were incredibly beautiful and very accurate; and that in the film are explained details (like why was winter in the castle or what happened to Belle's mother) that weren't in the previous film. I also loved most of the cast specially Josh Gad, Ewan McGregor, Luke Evans and Audra McDonald. I really appreciate the fact that some scenes were exactly like in the cartoon film of 1991 and that they took back some details that did not appear in the previous film but were in the first book (which author has the same name that the village in this new film). However, there were some things which I did not enjoy the most, for example, in this film was not included the song ""If I can't love her"" that in my opinion is the best of the whole musical. Instead the have created I knew song called ""Evermore"". I wouldn't say that it's an awful song, but the other one is definitely better. Nevertheless, I loved the song ""Days in he sun"" that they also created for this film. I would have loved if the had recorded the song while they were acting, like it was done in ""Les Miserables"". Due to I think that would have made the songs transmit a lot more emotion. In truth, this was a movie that I really enjoyed watching and that ended up complying with most of my expectations. I recommend this film, owing to is not too heavy and is that kind of film that will make you leave the cinema smiling."

","Missing magic, for the entire film you're waiting for a grande finale trick that will make up for it all. Sadly the climax is fast tracked and dull to say the least. The 2D tea party is the largest let down, followed by a flame-less candle and a faceless clock. Artificial artwork that should have been a painted dream, you're left wondering who had the permission to produce this, and had Walt been present, would he have let Disney be involved."
"mozziecat","5","1","4","3 April 2017"," Good - but...
","May be some spoilers for those who have never seen any version of beauty and the beast. Of course the story is well known - nothing much changes in this version. In fact, it's pretty point by point with the animated film. The sets and animation is quite good and they did choose great actors for the characters, the costumes are wonderful and all the singing is great. It just seemed to lack a bit of magic to me. The scenes with Maurice didn't seem to build up the drama about the beast enough. The editing or pace was quite rushed in his scenes. Not enough tension was built in so it didn't make as much sense why Gaston would do anything he did. It seems as if they wanted so much to build up the gay character that they lost the story in favor of an agenda."
"kendallvmead","7","1","4","2 April 2017"," A Little to Long.
","Disney did a wonderful job making this film absolutely beautiful. My favorite piece of craftsmanship that was in this film was the costumes. The simplicity of Belle's costumes throughout were remarkably gorgeous and the details on the villagers costumers were absolutely stunning in their simplicity as well.. Another aspect that I thought was very well done was Emma Watson's acting. Being that most of the film's characters were CGI I think she did a wonderful job from her facial expressions to her emotions working on a green screen. However, the reason I did not give this film a higher review was because it was a little long for my taste. The original film was only an hour and a half and this one had added on an additional thirty minutes and I believe that these minutes were not needed. At times, the movie did seem to drag on and I found myself drifting off and thinking about other things, so the time was something that definitely needed to be improved upon."
"lilywan","6","1","4","24 March 2017"," Nice songs as always
","I am quiet surprised when Emma did not sing so well cause it is supposed to be a musical film. Except for that, costumes design and all the other scenes in the film is quiet remarkable. Anyway, fairy tale has to be fairy tale, if we made it real the selection of the actress has to be more demanding. Get a little disappointed when the smart erudite little girl Belle in the childhood story is acted like a beautiful dressed not so smart girl in the movie."

","I love this all time Disney story, however...I can't say I loved the movie. I like it but not loved it. I loved seeing it in 3D...it was great looking at the scenery jump out and put you right there. Belle has a higher voice but Emma did a good job. The tavern scene in the beginning seemed weird, can't explain it. One or two new songs were added that seemed unneeded. My biggest pet peeve is that this is a Disney movie...so to watch the movie and see homosexual and crossing-dressing references in it was beyond surprising. Gaston had an uncomfortable moment when his companion hugged him rather inappropriately and he mentioned that he is single because he is clingy as he stares at Gaston admirably. During the battle at the castle...there where 3 men that was wrapped in women's clothing by the wardrobe - 2 ran embarrassed, but one remained and posed in delight and then pranced down the stairs with the wardrobe cheering him on. I'm just saying..those moments were disappointing. I don't think Walt Disney would have been pleased."
"tm-sheehan","7","1","4","22 March 2017"," Is this one version too many?
","This is the 7th film version of Beauty and The Beast and I really wonder why they made another, especially seeing it's part human and part animation but it works . It's neither a film version of the Broadway stage hit or a Human version of the great fully animated Disney feature film. It does have all the magic and effects that Disney dollars can throw at a film and a few new songs and plot twists.<br/><br/>The cast is very capable especially Emma Watson, who sings well and looks suitably enchanting as a true Disney Princess should . It's was fun to see some favourites of mine like Audra McDonald as Madame Garderobes and Emma Thompson as Mrs Potts . The new songs by Alan Menken don't really add anything to his original score in fact I think they made a mistake by not including Human Again in this film it's a great production number and I missed it, perhaps it's on the DVD extras cost certainly couldn't have been a factor in dropping it with Disney dollars behind it.<br/><br/>In conclusion it's a good film with reservations I prefer the 1946 Jean Cocteau version, watched it recently with new Phillip Glass opera soundtrack or The fully human live Broadway musical production, but yes it's lovely and pays little tributes to The Sound of Music opening scene Maria twirling while ""The Hills are Alive ""and little references to the Original Cocteau version but please no more Beauty and The Beasts , that's enough!"
"batmanjokercatwoman","7","1","4","22 March 2017"," Pretty but lifeless retelling
","There is a trend going on right now with Disney films, that they are redoing their animated classics in live-action – Alice In Wonderland, Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella, The Jungle Book and now the latest in this trend Beauty And The Beast. This one was going to be difficult for me because the 1991 Disney film Beauty And The Beast is one of my favourite films of all time.<br/><br/>So how do I feel this film? Honestly I spent the first half being pretty annoyed as it was just carbon copy with minor changes, but I just accepted it by the time I got to the second half and just pretended I was watching a play of the movie instead. But then I have to admit there was one really great scene that got me emotional towards the end. Not enough to make me love the film, in a way it highlights my biggest problem with the film, I'll get to it later and don't worry I won't spoil it.<br/><br/>The majority of it is pretty much a copy of the 1991 film, they might as well have used the same storyboards. The problem though is not so much that it redoes the same scenes, it's that they get lost in translation, not enough effort is put in to create the same feelings. I lost count over how many cut-to-blacks this film has.<br/><br/>Visually this film is really nice to look at. Many of the sets are well designed, the castle especially with all the little details. However the environments of the locations aren't well explored that you notice at times that it's shot on a sound stage. The CGI effects for the Beast is not that great, I don't understand why they couldn't use prosthetics, you could've saved legendary make-up artist Rick Baker from his early retirement. The best CGI goes to the animate objects, sure the designs were pretty creepy this time but I did buy them as genuine moving objects – the mechanics on the clocks look realistic and the teapot and cup look like real china. Be Our Guest was a visually stunning moment.<br/><br/>The acting all-round was more or less on the same level, they are great actors but the issue I have is that I'm always aware that they are playing the parts. I don't see Belle in this film, I just see Emma Watson playing Belle in this film and it's like that for everyone. It seems like all these big named actors were putting on performances for theatre instead of an actual film. It's kind of bad that I think the characters in an animated film feel more like real people than the ones played by real people. I don't care how much they expand on their backstories or how many additional character-building moments they are given; if they don't act natural I'm not going to be invested in them. They're never boring however, you can tell everyone had a lot of fun making this, so at times they share that enjoyment with you. The strongest performances are from Kevin Kline as Maurice and Josh Gad as Le Fou, I guess that helps that their characters are the most different from their animated counterparts, they're less goofy and are a little more realistic. The singing is not the greatest either, not Russell Crowe or Peirce Brosnan levels of bad, but not good compared to the singing in the original. The best singing comes from Audra McDonald, whom is a soprano but she's not given enough to sing.<br/><br/>In terms of what this added (again not to spoil the film), there are about four new songs added which were good I will admit, I could see these fitting into theatre productions quite well. There are some really good additional scenes like when Maurice and Belle work on a music box together and they mention her mother and a pretty unpleasant scene with Gaston and Maurice. There's a scene that could've taken this film in a unique direction, unfortunately it doesn't go anywhere and adds nothing except to try and expand on Belle's past which kind of ruins the subtle moment she had with her father at the beginning. Then there is the big scene towards the end that made me tear up, it was a real heart-breaking scene. It was built up quite well and when it happens it lets it play out. Very clever and by far the best scene they did in this film. So why is the best scene it's biggest problem? Because it's a moment that does not involve Belle or the Beast and it made me realise I how much didn't really care about them here. I love Belle and the Beast, they are awesome characters because in the original they are allowed to be characters. They have genuine emotions that you feel in all of their scenes and you feel their chemistry even in scenes without dialogue. Here despite being 'more developed' they feel still feel shallow, again it's because they don't feel like real people and their chemistry is non-existent.<br/><br/>I apologise that I keep making so many comparisons to the original but it's very difficult not to. This film keeps reminding me of the original, it keeps redoing it but not as well with minor changes and additions that aren't strong enough to let this film stand on it's own merits. Honestly, this film only works for me as like seeing a stage theatre version of a film you like. In fact if you watch this film without seeing the original, you'd probably think you are watching a stylised film adaptation of a musical play like 2004's Phantom Of The Opera. If you bare that in mind you'll enjoy this just fine, it's not bad by any means but it won't stand the test of time. The 1991 movie however is a timeless classic."

","When i was a kid Beauty and the Beast (1991) is one of my most favorite animated films of all time (followed by Mulan and Toy Story 2) so there's no denying that this review is going to be a little bias.<br/><br/>Why is that ? you might asked, it's because this Beauty and the Beast basically try to do exactly what the animated version do like literally almost copy and pasted frame by frame and this became the most negative things about this Live Action version even though it adds a few backstory here and there (which i appreciated) the part where it's exactly the same lacks the emotion or authenticity like 1991 version did.<br/><br/>A lot of iconic scene came out kind a bland because it can't go crazy like the animated film did instead it just move there in a frame called 'Beauty and the Beast 1991 version' in a way that there's so few room left to actually breathe (or dare i say they too scared to actually do something new?), sure production design is so beautiful sometimes even more than the original but when the emotion is not there at all it's pointless.<br/><br/>one thing that i really need to gave credit to is Luke Evans like wow he's really really great as Gaston, honestly he's one of the best thing about this version.<br/><br/>If we judge Beauty and the Beast ( 2017 ) by it's own without comparing it to the original movie it's a pretty good movie but still i think that's impossible because in the end it's a remake, and few of new backstory is not worth to trade with emotion and authenticity than the original has."

","Movie is almost mirror copy of the original animated version. Yet it is far worse. I tried to analyze the reason and it has to be bad direction.<br/><br/>Emma Watson first of all, is good casting in my opinion. But her acting... I wouldn't say was bad but went the wrong direction. Instead of innocent image of Belle, she had some sort of sensual facial expression in the beginning. This should've been corrected by the director.<br/><br/>The Lumiere, Cogsworth, and Mrs. Potts. What made the original work was the facial expression of these important characters. But the CG version completely destroys any facial acting if there were any. You can hardly see the face of Lumiere. And it was his face singing beginning of ""Be... Our... Guest"" that was such important moment. That scene is still there but doesn't have any impact. They should've exaggerated the size of their faces and actually make it 3D faces. Instead of just graphics. Bad decision here again.<br/><br/>The songs. The existing ones were still great. The new ones are horrible. Original songs, I heard them once and they stuck in my head. These new ones are very forgettable.<br/><br/>These all has to fall on the director."

","The 1991 animated feature is no doubt one of Disney's masterpieces. I, for one have seen it a countless number of times, and since the day of the Disney announced the 2017-remake, I hoped that the live-action version would encompass all the things that made the company's original feature so great. I was not disappointed. <br/><br/>All they really needed to do was stick to original design of the movie, which is what they did, essentially. They may have tweaked a few details and added a few things to the storyline, but I felt that in doing so, they added more depth to the characters, as well as the story. <br/><br/>What I particularly liked was that they really worked on the relationship between Belle and Beast. In the original animated feature, the two were completely different, and there was not a lot commonality. The live-action feature included certain scenes where the two characters bonded on a more emotional and intellectual level. They seemed to be more compatible, and I truly felt that this made their love story even more powerful than the original. <br/><br/>The set design and the costumes were spectacular, no question about that.<br/><br/>My only complaint would have to be that I was not a big fan of Emma Watson's portrayal of Belle. She was beautiful, no doubt, her singing was alright but there was just something missing. There was a certain amount of stiffness to her performance and I just could not shake that off."

","BEAUTY AND THE BEAST is another vapid and overblown live-action remake of a Disney cartoon classic. When I heard that Emma Watson was cast in this, I had my suspicions and sadly they were all proved right on watching. Watson might bear a superficial resemblance to the cartoon Belle, but her lines are delivered in a stiff, stilted manner and her singing voice is no great shakes either. Dan Steven's CGI beast is a little better, but the animated household objects have lost all of their charm from the cartoon.<br/><br/>The film is typical Disney, insofar as it's inoffensive, shallower-than-shallow, and sickeningly sweet. The ending takes sentimentality into new uncharted waters. The whole thing is an ode to the latest CGI effects, with unwelcome computer graphics dominating every moment. Only Luke Evans gives a pantomime performance that could be vaguely described as old-fashioned. Plus Disney continues to champion the usual wrongful stereotypes of physical beauty which really should have gone out in the 1950s."

","When they announced my favorite Disney movie was being made into a live action movie, I waited eagerly for a few years to see it in the theater. I was even more excited when Emma Watson was cast as Belle and other wonderful cast members. I am so happy the movie did not disappoint after all that waiting. They sing all the great Beauty and the Beast hits and the classic yellow dress and grand library are of course part of the movie. They do a great job of including all the essential elements and elaborating on details or give background info. Belle is resourceful, brave, and intelligent. She isn't afraid to stand out from people in her small village who don't think she should do things like read books and try to teach children to read, even though it does bother her that they think her odd. She also stands her ground against Gaston, the Beast and even her own father when she tricked him into switching places. <br/><br/>There was one new song that the Beast sings that was a little cheesy but it was OK and they didn't have Belle and the Beast be the only ones to wear blue like they did in the cartoon so they stood out more. Just like the cartoon version I'm still confused about the whole timeline of this spell from start to end. How people age while under the spell or was it not that long of a time period? And I like how they explain in this version how people in the village somehow forgot about the ""prince""/Beast and his castle but who did they think was ruling them during the time of the spell? And it is never explained what happened to the Beast's father (unless I missed that), so is he king or still a prince? <br/><br/>In conclusion there were some questions still remaining and a few minor things I didn't love but I think it would be exceedingly difficult to make an adaption be a 100%.

","Well, I'm almost 60, knew the story line since I was 6, have seen every version and this one really did blow me away with it's stunning visuals. Unlike transformers where I got so much input, I went to sleep, Disney had me wanting more. I know I'm old school because the tainted part of the movie for my wife and I was the two scenes where the ""left wing globalists"" stick in the the gay guys and the cross dresser. It blatantly detracted from the story line. It's almost obligatory these days, but I didn't expect it from a classic. When it elicited laughs from the audience instead of moans, it confirmed for me the ongoing degradation and desensitization of society. I'm not homophobic or intolerant, I'm moral. Our kids completely missed it which was the saddest thing about the whole experience. Token gays are a fact of life and so I guess I have to get with the program.... or leave the planet."
"fuzzysweater-09099","7","1","5","2 April 2017"," I Think I'm Obsessed With This Movie...
","To start off, I absolutely loved the original 1991 film and admired Belle as a character ever since I was a young child. But the original did have multiple plot holes such as the age of Prince Adam when the enchantress put the curse on him and his servants. But in this remake this plot hole is fixed by showing the Prince as an adult when the enchantress showed up at his palace and by changing the lyrics in ""Be our guest"" from ""ten years we've been rusting"" to ""to long we've been rusting."" Not to mention the fact that the last rose petal was set to fall on the prince's 21st birthday in the 1991 film. This was changed by simply not giving the final rose petal a known due date. <br/><br/>I also believe that Emma Watson made a good Belle because she is the closest thing to a human Belle. She did the role well and didn't seem out of character at any time. Even though she didn't really sound all that close to the animated Belle in her singing parts it's not necessarily a big deal. The rest of the casting in this movie was great as well and the props and sets in the film were grand and magical as well. My favorite performance in this movie was probably Josh Gad as Lefou, he truly brought his character to life and the Gaston song in the bar was just so amazing to watch! It was definitely a magical film for me.<br/><br/>So in conclusion, I honestly can't wait till this movie gets on DVD and blu-ray because I will continue to watch it over and over and over again. I highly recommend it to Disney fans, non Disney fans and people who just want to watch a charming movie.<br/><br/>Thank you for reading my review!"
"kaliahdickens","6","1","5","31 March 2017"," Okay.
","Beauty and the Beast has been one of my favorite childhood movies of all time but the live action version just didn't do it for me. It could have been their casting choices or the fact that the animations just felt weird but it just didn't feel right to me. The movie followed the storyline of the cartoon perfectly and I had no problem with that part of it. My three main criticisms would have to be one the new songs that were added just felt weak compared to its other musical masterpieces like Be Our Guest, Beauty and The Beast, Gaston, and Belle. The new songs just didn't match up with the older ones. And I was surprised to hear them. My second criticism would have to be about the ending scene when the mob is storming the castle. It was anticlimactic and some of my favorite scenes were removed. I was hoping for this big fun battle like in the cartoon but it just didn't translate into a live action version. My last criticism would have to be one that I and many others have had since the cartoon version. The big reveal of the prince at the end of the movie. A lot of people say that the beauty budget was wasted on Belle in the cartoon version of the movie when concerning the Prince's human form reveal. In the live action version, I spent the entire movie hoping that I wouldn't be disappointed once again but unfortunately I was. The only difference between the prince's looks in the live action and cartoon is in the cartoons Prince and Beast were equal in the looks department and in the live action, the Beast looked better. But overall the movie was okay. It wasn't above or below my expectations."

","26 years after the classic Disney film was released, Bill Condon directs Emma Watson and Dan Stevens in a retelling of Beauty and the Beast.<br/><br/>This film was absolutely stunning. I sat and watched my childhood on screen with real people for the first time in my life, and I am not ashamed to admit I shed a tear once or twice. I grew up watching Emma Watson as Hermoine, so seeing her on screen as my all time favourite Disney Princess was highly emotional. <br/><br/>The cinematography in this took my breath away. Every frame of this film was stunning. The cinematography was beautifully done. The costume designs were so expertly done, they all looked like they were direct from the animated film. The casting was done so stupendously it was like the original animations had just stepped out of the film and began waltzing across the screen. <br/><br/>The only two qualms I had were <br/><br/><ul><li>It seemed to take Emma Watson a while to warm up to singing. It was very rough in the first song of the film, and then she seemed to get better as it went along.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The pacing of the film seemed quite rushed. I understand they were pretty much copying the original animation, but I feel like it could have been paced out just that little bit better. I felt a little out of breath watching it, whizzing from one point to another. </li></ul><br/><br/>Those qualms aside, this still took my breath away. It definitely deserves the hype it got. This was a wonderful retelling of such a classic tale. I hope that this generation of children may enjoy this as much as I enjoyed the original growing up. They deserve a movie like this, full of love, hope and romance. And of course, the age old moral, don't judge a book by it's cover."
"adean81","Null","1","5","30 March 2017"," Beauty and the Beast Review
","It's a tale as old as time and a song as old as rhyme, Beauty and the Beast. The original Disney animated movie was the first animated movie to ever be nominated for the Best Picture category at the Academy Awards, back in 1991. So it's no wonder that there was a lot of pressure to get the live-action version just right. It's easy to compare it to the animated movie, but the live-action version brings a lot of new elements to the story. It provides backstory for several characters as well as better romantic development between Belle and the Beast. That's all accompanied by some great and often delightful acting performances as well as the musical songs.<br/><br/>While the movie is basically a remake of the animated version it also changes a few things and adds in scenes in order to tell the story better. One new element the movies adds comes from the original fairy tale story, and that's Belle asking for a rose every year from her father Maurice. The movie also adds in new scenes between Belle and the beast that creates a better romantic connection between the two. Emma Watson does a great job playing Belle, she brings a lot the character beyond being warm and kind. Dan Stevens also does a good job at making the beast sympathetic as well as caring. <br/><br/>As for the songs. While Emma Watson does not sound like Paige O'Hara (the voice of Belle in the cartoon) she does a wonderful job singing the songs. Surprisingly Dan Stevens has a great singing voice and gets an original song that is actually really good. Even though Ewan McGregor's French accent was not great, his version of Be Our Guest was fantastic and different from the original. Emma Thompson does a wonderful job as Mrs. Potts. While not copying Angela Lansbury, she still brings warmth and care to the character. <br/><br/>Not everything in the movie was perfect. Luke Evans is a great actor but his version of Gaston is not as fun as he was in the cartoon. This is evident in the song ""Gaston"". Josh Gad does a great job as LaFou, who is not quite the fool he was in the animated movie, but Gad has a great singing voice. The other thing that was quite as well done is the ballroom scene with the title song. The visuals didn't feel as grand and magical despite the setting. Some of the directing were off in a few scenes, where the focus wasn't clear and the angles weren't perfect. Some of the designs for the object characters were odd looking, but after a while, you get used to it. <br/><br/>However, if we stop comparing this to the animated version, this movie is a great adaptation that has a lot to add to the story. The opening musical ""Belle"" draws the audience right into the character and the town. It sets up the story perfectly and does a great job establishing why Belle doesn't fit in with the town. The ending had some small changes that were surprising and interesting. Overall this movie was beautiful, sweet and magical, everything you want in a Disney fairy tale movie."
"md_bunny1003","7","1","5","29 March 2017"," A visually mesmerizing movie
","First and foremost, this movie is visually stunning. From the beginning to the end. Disney has done an amazing job of keeping everything seem so alive, and alarmingly terrifying at times.<br/><br/>This is a story about Belle, who is a well read town girl and wants something more than ""this provincial life"". She eventually steps into Beast, who is a prince cursed by an enchantress. He has time to reverse himself until the last petal of an enchanted rose falls. In the meanwhile, Belle is continuously wooed by all-brawn-and-no-brain Gaston, who has an evil intention of killing the Beast and forcibly marrying Belle. Love is slowly blossoming between Belle and the Beast, but will it be enough to break the curse?<br/><br/>All the characters in the story have blended nicely with an amazing cast. As I have said before, the visuals were stunning, and so were the ballads performed throughout the musical. A 3D experience is phenomenal, and kind of required."
"pyrocitor","6","1","5","28 March 2017"," Hairy Pouter and the Reluctantly Redundant Remake
","Watching Bill Condon's Beauty and the Beast as an adult is like running into your best friend from grade school at a bar. They're hammered, decked out in a circa 2001 Avril Lavigne Sk8ter Boi outfit and faux-hawk, but surprise: they work as an insurance claims adjuster, and make awkward, drunken conversation about linoleum. Yep. Hear me out. Heady nostalgia, amusement (both uncomfortable and sincere), but all tampered by a vaguely alienating sense of antiquated tackiness and boredom. This is your old friend, and you'll always love them in spite of... them. But did you really need to run into them again like... this? This is the battle of Beauty and the Beast 2.0: not as beastly as your worst fears would have it, but a far cry from the beauty that once was. <br/><br/>'Tale as old as time' doesn't work as well when it's a tale barely older than the average viewer, begetting the invariable 'Too Soon!' griping. Sadly, in this case, the peanut gallery may be justified. It's rare to see a film tiptoeing around its fan following so fearfully, every frame oozing desperation to validate its own existence. From the first notes of the soundtrack, there's an uneasy balance between near shot-for-shot slavishness and defiant new beats. But, for every closed plot hole (so THAT'S why no one in the village noticed the gigantic, deserted castle!), there's awkward, superfluous character exposition (did Belle really need to be saddled with a 'disappeared parent' subplot, a-la Amazing Spider-Man?). The original songs are, naturally, too darn good not to make hearts soar, but they're staged with varying degrees of imagination and vibrancy. New tunes range from cutely forgettable to downright cringe-worthy (let's just say the Beast's solo romantic ballad plays better on Broadway...), while inexcusably lame tweaks to Gaston's legendarily raucous tavern ditty will have you pulling out every last inch of you covered in hair. And so on. More than almost any adaptation, Condon courts an invariable game of constant compare/contrast that he's fated to lose (would you want to go toe-to-toe with the first animated Best Picture nominee?), conjuring an audience commentary of ""Meh, that was better in the original"" to ""Did we really need that?"" Throw in some lurching pacing - how can a film 40 minutes longer than its predecessor feel so much more rushed? - and staid, wooden sensibilities, with only glimmers of the original's whimsy or the playfulness of 2016's Jungle Book, and you've got one squirmy audience. <br/><br/>It's a shame, because Condon's fairy tale unearths plenty of magic when it's allowed to breathe. If there's one strain that feels fully fleshed out in live action, it's the poor provincial town's bullying of Belle, seeing her unmarried, innovative intellect as beyond 'odd,' but as a downright ideological threat verging on witchcraft. It's this focal point that lends surprising sincerity and sweetness to her budding romance with her ferocious captor - she connects with him as a fellow outsider, passionate, but fearfully clueless about how to societally integrate. Condon also finds surprising poignancy in the Beast's household workers resigned to living as animated objects as penance for taking no accountability in preventing his warped, cruelly spoiled upbringing. A subtle nature/nurture conversation of a social environment's power to corrupt through passive-aggressive teasing or shameful inactivity? Now that feels like classic Disney! <br/><br/>If the prospect of 2017 special effects bringing the magic to life were a selling point, it's still a mixed bag. It's ironic that the film's prologue cautions against gaudy, superficial excess, as Condon's film is almost exhaustingly lavish, but too loud and busy to settle into the painstaking elegance of its predecessor. The surreal twisty, Jean Cocteau decor is pleasingly intricate, but almost perennially muted by murky, grey lighting, while the vaguely creepy anthropomorphic household utensils take considerable acclimatizing to. Even the 'Be Our Guest' showstopper manages the paradox of looking ferociously expensive but oddly unspectacular. Still - Condon does nail The Dance, and it alone is transcendently lovely enough to keep the film afloat, and then some. No, you're twirling around humming the theme. Hmmpff. <br/><br/>You want to love Emma Watson's Belle. You really do. But, Hermione hangover aside, she feels distressingly miscast - as sullen and sunken as her wincingly autotuned singing voice, she's too caustic to capture more than dribbles of Belle's warmth, spunkiness, and bubbly braininess. Trading Harry for Hairy, Dan Stevens makes a superb Beast, dubious CGI aside. His Beast is a grumbling hipster, his former effete condescension bleeding into his brooding making his character arc all the more charmingly self-aware. Though far from the size of a barge (no ""biceps to spare"" here, amusingly), Luke Evans swings solidly at Gaston's seismic chauvinism. But, although he hits the musical notes, he's too tentative a scene-chewer, and lacks the thunderous charisma to properly sell the narrative's masterful deconstruction of toxic masculinity (it's no wonder LeFou has to bribe these townspeople to - literally - sing his praises). Speaking of: 10 points to Josh Gad, singlehandedly stealing the show with a pitch-perfect deluge of adorably fawning silliness. While Kevin Kline's softly quirky Maurice is pleasantly winning, his additional screen time adds little to the film. Indeed, most of the comedic and emotional lifting is left to the charming voice cast, and Ewan McGregor, Ian McKellen, Emma Thompson, Stanley Tucci, and others all brim with the mountainous charm and silliness you'd hope for. <br/><br/>There is beauty within Condon's film, but it's largely enshrouded by oodles of overstuffed visual dazzle and fumbling mimesis that fail to disguise the the film's heart isn't quite there. It's an amiable diversion, but a worthwhile remake? Let's just say time won't be kind to this tale. But let's be honest: it's Beauty and the Beast. Reviews or not, you're probably going to obstinately check it out anyway, muttering ""surely it can't be as bad as all that."" And you know what? Be my guest.<br/><br/>-6/10"

In fact the real prince was kind of wimpy. It would have been harder to live with him. The actors were all good, especially Kevin Kline and the songs were quite fine if you like that sort of thing.

","First of all, I'm writing this because there needs to be an impartial review. I see people saying it's perfect and people saying is garbage which is neither.<br/><br/>Now, for people saying it is boring and a waste of time because is the same as the animated. This is a REMAKE, what were you expecting? and also it is not exactly the same as the cartoon, there are subtle differences that actually make sense like: 1. we get more explanation to how the curse works with the explanation to why the village people don't remember the castle or the people in it. 2. we also get backstory of both the Beast and Belle 3. Belle is now the inventor which is actually cool and if you are not OK with that, I mean is 2017 like you and your bigotry mind should go live in that provincial town 3. The new songs are really good and worked perfectly, in my opinion 4. Le Fou is now canonically gay which is neither good or bad, actually I always assume he already was. Although 2 seconds of him dancing with another guy is not that much of a big ""gay moment"" for it to make headlines an polemic, but that's for another rant.<br/><br/>And for people giving this a ten, I have to agree that it is not THAT good: Some of the CGI is pretty average and over used in some points I also have to say that it lacks some of the charm from the original because the characters feel a little flat sometimes plus I could actually live without the new piano guy, that new addition was just meh<br/><br/>Overall I give it a 7 because it has some little flaws but it is a very good and a pretty solid retake on a beautiful story that we will always love"

","No sense of me telling the plot, because it has been told so many times through the years, this film is basically a remake of the 1991 animated Disney film, although I never really watched it. This film is for kids and adults, they through in some adult jokes that would probably go over the kids head. It not always light, it also shows it's dark in spots.<br/><br/>The effects are pretty good here to the point where it becomes the whole movie in spots. Emma Watson is great has the tough minded Bella, Dan Stevens really brings it has the beast. Luke Evans is so good at being hateful, and I was bit disappointed on his characters demise, he was so unlikable, I felt his character should have gotten a bigger justice then what I saw. And why is Josh Gad even in this, he is so out of place here, now I often find Josh Gad funny and entertaining, but his character seems to belong in another movie.

If the villagers actually like Gaston? What happened to Belle's mother? What Belle and the Beast actually had in common? This film answered all those questions.<br/><br/>Some reviews mention the CGI is distracting but I didn't find that, it actually greatly enhanced some of the more visual scenes like 'Be Our Guest' which was great in the original but even better in this version. <br/><br/>The major flaw in this film is Emma Watson. Her facial expressions are often out of sync with what is actually happening in the plot, and the extraordinary tendencies and personality referred to by the other characters are more heard than seen. Les Miserables also made the same mistake by casting someone who couldn't sing in a musical and let them get way overshadowed by the people who could sing. <br/><br/>Other than that it was 20 minutes too long, but most movies are."

"lasttimeisaw","7","1","5","25 March 2017"," A fair fairy-tale with mass appeal
","""Would you love a monster?"", has become an increasingly moot question in our age branded by individualism and non-conformist viewpoint, so the answer would be: you betcha! How cool can be to tame a beast like that? Not to mention, his monstrous front aside, there nestling a genuine prince inside, that's a bonus!<br/><br/>This Disney live-action revamp of the classic fairy-tale, directed by the workmanlike Bill Condon (DREAMGIRLS 2006 and TWILIGHT franchise, with occasional curve-ball GODS AND MONSTERS 1998), clings firmly to its 1991 animation in its storyboard and iconic songs, rendered altogether with a grandiose flourish could run rings around Kenneth Branagh's Cinderella (2015).<br/><br/>The preamble musters efficiency and glimpses of royal pageantry with a more plausible premise (in the realm of magic, sky is the limit), a selfish prince (Steven) is transformed into a monster (and his servants into a clutter of objects) by an enchantress (Morahan), he must learn to truly love someone and get the reciprocal affection before time is running out, otherwise, him along with his hapless underlings will lose humanity for keeps. Then the narrative introduces our heroine Belle (Watson), a French village girl, who has a yen for reading and is an inventor herself (both are inadvisable hobbyhorses for womenfolk strait-jacketed by macho insularity), she is relentlessly pursued by Gaston (Evans), a bumptious village war-hero who doesn't take no for an answer. When Belle's father Maurice (Kline) is interned in the monster's castle for stealing a rose (a gift under Belle's request), Belle trades herself for her father, and inevitably develops a quasi- Stockholm syndrome to her captor (with the benevolent prodding from those anthropomorphic knick-knacks, among which a motormouth Ewan McGregor revels in sporting a wavering French accent as a candelabra). But when an exasperated Gaston knows about the existence of the monster, he convenes the village mob to assail the castle, there will only be one man standing between him and the monster, Belle is entangled in the scramble, but her feels powerless to stop the inevitable, until, yes, the magic moment after a poignant humanity-dissipating corollary. What a volatile enchantress! <br/><br/>The upgraded musical numbers are meat and potatoes to the allure of the film, highlights are BE OUR GUEST (a cynosure garnished with the most deliriously enchanting special effects), GASTON (Evans is so close to snag that Hollywood leading man status for a voluntarily outed gay actor) and Emma Thompson's rendition of the theme song, a balm to one's ears, it is beggar belief that she hasn't been cast in a musical before!<br/><br/>Acting wise, the film is a bog-standard family friendly fare demands nothing taxing for its stellar cast, Watson is presentable but far from impressive, Stevens is understandably curbed by his overwhelming costume, even his voice is muffled as if emanated from a mask, only Josh Gad's LeFou adds a nice (but overtly praised) touch of gay inclusivity.<br/><br/>Disney's gargantuan ambition of transposing their animation repertoire into live-action by virtue of technique advancement, has been in full swing and proved to be not only viable but also massively lucrative, the only gripe is they could be more gallant in its story-telling (different angles, re- interpretation, reflecting current perspective, et al.), but at the same time, one cannot help but wondering does this trend flag up an overlooking threat to the popularity of animation filmmaking, a food for thought - when CGI anthropomorphism can seamlessly meet the demands, what will audience (in particular, grownups) prefer, a more realistic context or a self-conscious other-worldly dimension?"
"isaacglover_05","6","1","5","25 March 2017"," The good and the bad
","To be more precise my rating is a 6.5 but thought I'd round it up to a 7. Well this has been a Disney remake that I, along with what I am sure is many other people, anticipated for a very long time. I didn't expect too much, though: no one could top Angela Lansbury's rendition of Beauty and the Beast. And Emma Watson, though she does have the beauty that is similar to Belle's, lacks almost everything else that made Belle the way she was. <br/><br/>I'll start off with a list of what I believe was bad, then end this review on a good note. These are of course my opinions and are to be taken with a grain of salt! (Possible spoilers ahead). The Bad: 1. Emma Watson's singing voice. I was informed before going into the cinema that her voice was autotuned, but man this was autotuned to the MAX! Some parts almost sounded a bit too robotic for my liking. 2. Ewan McGregor. I respect him and do believe he is a fine actor, but he put on the worst French accent I have heard. Though, his rendition of ""Be Our Guest"" compensated for it. 3. When Beast transformed back into his human self, I would have very much preferred Dan Steven's actual look than try and copy the cartoon's human interpretation of the beast. 4. The ending felt a bit too abrupt. One moment they were kissing, then all of a sudden they were in a ballroom and everything was completely fine. I understand that this probably had to do with pacing issues but I do believe there was just some small transitional scene. 5. The beast's solo was a bit boring and not very effective. Dan Stevens has a nice voice but I felt that it didn't give as much of a punch as I had anticipated. <br/><br/>The good: 1. The visuals were absolutely stunning! I loved the cold winter-y setting used in the castle. Absolutely gorgeous and gives a very gloomy feel at the same time. The scene where Belle runs up the hills as her Reprise reaches its climax was just as breathtaking in my opinion. 2. I'm not trying to get political here but I liked the fact that they had some dark skinned actors and actresses instead of just all white like they did in the original cartoon. 3. It was great to see the prologue have a more in depth story which explains some of the plot holes present in the original film. I won't go too in depth and let the viewer find that out. 4. Emma Thompson did a very good job on ""Beauty and the Beast"", though my previous statement still stands that no one could top Angela Lansbury's rendition of it. 5. Be Our Guest was such a delight to look at! The visuals, the choreography, the singing! It was like watching a fireworks display. 6. I really liked Le Fou's character development in ""The Mob Song"". They gave him much more depth than they did in the original. I'm not just talking about the fact that they made him a homosexual, but I liked how they didn't make him a delusional, devoted idiot. He knew what was right from wrong. 7. The humour was effective. Then again I am easily entertained so I won't go too in depth with this point. <br/><br/>So all in all, it was a pretty good attempt. The visuals were stunning and most of the music was a delight to listen to, but I do believe that the original will always be the better one. I am no film critic, just a simple movie watcher, so like I said before: take all this with a grain of salt!"
"najafisaghar","8","1","5","24 March 2017"," A must see!
","To the children of 90s, I think, this movie brings back a torrent of memories from the past; especially all those weekends spent in front of the TV watching Belle turning the Beast into a prince charming. The scenes in the movie were too good and too cartoonish to be real! yet it was. What you saw in the cartoon is exactly reproduced in the movie; the scenes, the songs, the clothes ... though the childhood stories of Belle and the beast is added to the movie as a subgenre; you could also see people of different colors and even of sexuality, there is a fast scene of a gay couple dancing. Regarding the performances, I have to say, Dan Stevens, the beast, played wonderfully as did Emma Watson. The cast in general play and perform in such a harmony that they offer you a dream- like world; this colorful movie can offer you a two hour of joy and reminiscence whether you watch it once or a hundreds of times."

","Belle (Emma Watson) is a...yeah probably no need for a plot synopsis since this is the tale as old as time and it would just bore the hell out of any reader. So lets just get to it. ""Beauty and the Beast"" is the live action Disney remake that comes twenty six years after the gorgeous animated feature.<br/><br/>I am more not only fine, but encourage the retelling of classical tales in any kind of medium. It has been done since the dawn of humanity and I see no problem in doing so as long as there is always something new to add to these stories and some fresh silver lining to find in our characters. Going into this I must admit that I was very frighted to be treated to a shot for shot remake that I would have enjoyed only because of charm and would have felt embarrassed about it.<br/><br/>Whilst there is treading of familiar grounds, I was so pleasantly surprised to see what a great, touching and progressive modern take Disney was able to stamp on it. I am a big fan of the animated feature, the story is really universal and whilst this entry does not touch the emotional heights and the charm of the original, it offers a reminder of what a flawless piece of storytelling this is and it graces us with a good enough touch that managed to take me genuinely to enjoy and live this story one more time in a different way.<br/><br/>Whilst the songs might be the same they are always so fantastically entertaining on their own, Bill Condon builds on that and assembles a series of flashy musical numbers that all live beautifully on screen. There is no fast cutting, the editing decisions in these pieces are always warranted and the filmmakers manage to strike a perfect balance of seeing everything unfold on screen and using the editing to enhance the music. There are also a couple on updated or new musical numbers and it was a great sign that they flowed with the picture fluently, they felt genuine and didn't play as a forced new addition.<br/><br/>Of course the real spearhead of this production is its incredible cast and what can one say that the list of names here cannot already do on its own. It is just pure glee, there isn't one half of a bad casting decision, everybody not only fits their role, but does the perfect amount of updating and nuance to make you buy into them as soon as they appear on screen. Luke Evans was definitely the highlight for me, he brought Gaston to the screen in all of his ridiculousness and irony, it was a pleasure to see and was the high point of comedy of an already strongly funny film.<br/><br/>Another magical strength of the film is its CGI. There are a couple of green screens that got under my skin because of their blatant notability, especially considering how excellent the rest of the VFX were. This was really state of the art work. I literally could not tell all of the animated characters were apart from the live action ones, it was completely seamless in a way that I think we've never seen done this good before. The question never came up, there was not a single false beat, they were absolutely perfect.<br/><br/>However, what might be the very best part of this update is just how modern it is. No, not only because of a gay character, which still is such a brilliant addition because of how brilliantly they manage to weave it into the story and adapt it into a fairy tale character. There's much more here, many genre conventions are broken, many male/female stereotypes are purposefully bent and turned on their heads, there is diversity and it so beautiful to see such an iconic story get an adaptation that is a better representation of the human race.<br/><br/>Yes, there is no denying some of the ground treaded is very familiar and I am the first to say that there still is some space for change in this story, there still are a couple of plot point that can be updated and because of how modern the take overall is I felt like some events and minor character dynamics could have had a little polishing. Technically too the film has some moments of disjointed editing and it could have done with a little more cutting. Don't mistake me, the two hours never drag, but they do feel kind of unnecessary by the end, a five to ten minute tightening could have done the job.<br/><br/>I was initially a little cold on this film, but after realizing just how much I enjoyed it, how it actually got to me on an emotional level by the end and how charmed I was by the characters and their new iterations. I have to admit that I would be happily up to rewatching the film which was something I was doubting going in. I bumped up the score a little because of this, I hope that a further viewing confirms my feelings on this."
"jasonsharden","6","1","5","22 March 2017"," Missed Opportunites
","Disney's latest live action remake is a wonderful trip down memory lane, but it doesn't really bring anything new to the table. It follows the animated feature line for line, but with extra scenes and songs to try and deepen the story a little. Those added details don't really go anywhere though, which is an unfortunate missed opportunity when you have such fascinating source material to work with. Getting to see these timeless characters reenacted with today's talent was also a lot of fun, and though they do look the part, their singing voices were tainted with heavy doses of autotuning, and some just lacked energy all together. It felt as if the filmmakers were holding themselves back from making a more fleshed out version of the animated feature, but it was still highly entertaining. The stunning visuals, all star cast, and added details and songs make the story feel new again for today's audiences, but in the end, it reminds me why the first one was so brilliant to begin with."

Emma Watson plays belle in this film and she does a decent job, she fit the role with her looks and singing voice. I also thought she was a pretty strong female character that is good for women to see. However, I felt like her character was a little bland and wooden which made her one of the least memorable characters in this film. Dan Stevens plays the beast in this film and I thought he did a great job, I thought his character had a good character arc in the film and I liked his subtle humour that he had in the role. Luke Evans plays Gaston in this film and he was absolutely the perfect person to play this role, he had the look, the voice and the charisma he had oozed on the screen. Josh gadd also had great comedic timing in this film and I loved his chemistry with Evans in this film. Ewan McGregor and ian McKellen play lemuier and cogsworth and they encapsulated the roles perfectly and I loved them in these roles. The story does have some truly emotional moments that makes you care about the majority of characters. However, similar to how I felt about the 2014 Cinderella film this film doesn't really add anything new to its story which makes it an easy watch but doesn't do anything that interesting. The script has some great humour in it that really surprised me and actually had me and the audience laughing quite a lot. The drama also works and you end up buying the development in belle and beasts relationship. The style of this film has some excellent singing sequences that are very familiar but memorable in this film. Overall this is a great remake that hopefully leads to more of these remakes."
"themovieparadise","8","1","5","20 March 2017"," Has Its Shortcomings, But Is Still a Faithful Adaptation
","The overall look of this movie is fantastic. Everything from the production design, to the costumes, to the character design is flawless. Director Bill Condon did a masterful job working with all the different departments in order to capture the look of the original film. That may sound like an easy feat, but it really isn't. Not only did they have to capture the look of it, but they had to capture the feel of it as well, which they did in spades! I was immediately whisked away into the world of the animated film, which is a high compliment. I think a lot of the technical aspects of the film are what really shines. The CGI works, for the most part. I'll talk about the Beast in a minute, but I thought the CGI for Lumiere, Cogsworth, Mrs. Potts, and all the other appliances were top-notch. Not only did they look great on their own, but they blended well with the real world. Nothing stood out as looking fake when they interacted with Belle, which is more than I can say than with the Beast. But I'll get into that later. The songs were also perfectly recaptured. From the choreography to the cinematography, these scenes were flawless. All the songs, from ""Belle"" to ""Gaston"" to ""Be Our Guest"", were excellently realized, and effectively translated into live action. You can tell Condon put a lot of time and care into making sure they worked, and he absolutely succeeded in doing so..."
"marymontoya93","7","1","5","20 March 2017"," The real risk was visual
","The Disney's bet about creating the remake of such an epic story was visionary and as it comes, risky. Its just predicable the huge amount of critics from the classic fans. In my opinion the real goal of the production is in visual terms, in fact, the visual effects sometimes are just good enough, the real problem is that good enough isn't enough for the magnitude of this film. Specially in the village, for me its such evident the chrome used that it seems intentional from the director, make it look like a tale, three point over a simple animation. The castle and the unreal characters works, it force you to forget about picky unbelievable details of the village and push you in the whole fantastic and magic story, where we can't resists when we are in front of such a splendorous tale. The perform of Emma Watson its not far from the action range we all already know of her, but lets be clear, what is the big difference between Bella and Hermione, they both are perfect, pretty, intelligent, weirdo girls, the perfect essence for Emma interpretation. Beast its a good Beast, I rescue the visual effects and his look, it is just as good as it must have to be. In other terms, the art, music and story development its satisfactory, I enjoy this film, having clear from it begging the purpose of Disney and that its not a master piece."

","Disney is making a lot of live action remakes now, and this is the one I have been wishing for after Cinderella.<br/><br/>I'll start with the pros. Of course, the CGIs and the costumes and lavish production designs are fantastic. Dan Stevens is great as the Beast, and so is Luke Evans as the arrogant Gaston.<br/><br/>My main concern in this movie is actually some of the singing. I was distracted by the autotune, most especially from Belle's songs. I love Emma Watson, but I personally think she is miscast and there were other actresses better fit to play the role.<br/><br/>This remake is also not as charming or magical as the original. Still good, but didn't up my expectations.<br/><br/>To sum it up, the animation still is better."

"kileymattson-84261","3","1","6","21 September 2017"," Meh
","The one thing I have to say about this movie is they sacrificed vocal talent for big Hollywood names. Emma Watson's portrayal of Belle, the leading heroine, was awful. Her vocals were mediocre at best and I felt as if she portrayed Belle a bit to soft and not as the sassy ""I can take care of myself"" girl we saw in the 1991 movie. Don't even get me started on Luke Evans. His portrayal of Gaston was atrocious. I really would have liked to see some better, bigger voices in this movie. <br/><br/>Even with the mediocre voices and acting this film is visually stunning. The color palletes they chose were beautiful and the CGI was incredible. <br/><br/>Would I recommended this movie? Yes and no. If you have seen the 1991 version, then don't waste your time. If you haven't seen the 1991 version then go for it. I promise you will enjoy the animated version much more."

","I thought Beauty and the Beast was a great movie, well good made. It definitely had similarities to the original Beauty and the Beast cartoon in 1991. There were scenes that weren't in the original so that it could make the whole story longer to the live-action remake. The CGI to the castle objects were outstanding considering the movie was filmed in 2015 and took a year to make the CGI for the castle objects. The casting was perfect; Emma Watson did an amazing job as Belle and sung beautifully, Dan Stevens did well as the Beast, Luke Evans of course was superb as Gaston never expected to sing good, and everyone else who are the castle objects did awesome. Disney did an astounding job making a live-action remake, looking forward to their other remakes such as Mulan."

As soon as the first person entered the castle and then when Emma entered the castle things started to becoming really interesting. I personally LOVED the clock and the Candelebra. Done extremely well with a lot of laughter through the movie. The beast was done extremely well to me. Reading some of the comments just brought me back to the idea that there are many sourpusses that really just go to watch a movie to try and ridicule it and look for flaws.

However, I must say that I was not disappointed in any way. I loved watching as my kids eyes lit up as they followed the plot with what I can only say was the same enthusiasm I had when watching it so many years ago. I am not ashamed to say as well that I too watched with a renowned enthusiasm. I highly suggest that the Disney-loving parents take their children to see this movie as they will not be disappointed.

"FlueFaker","8","1","6","7 April 2017"," A brilliant revisit to a beautiful tale from our childhoods
","I didn't have any expectations for this film due to the overwhelming disappointment I felt with the previous live action adaptations of Cinderella and The Jungle Book. It was due to this that I didn't expect to like this film. I was, however, pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>For a start, this film fixes nonsensical aspects of the original which was a fantastic starting point – the original was never perfect so it made sense to remake it in order to fix these imperfections. The entire story makes more sense with the prince no longer being an eleven-year-old when cursed; there being an explained reason for the servants also being cursed; the fact that no one remembers the castle's existence; etc. There was also a more solid reason for the prince being cursed since the audience didn't really see much justification in the original as there were few examples of his selfishness.<br/><br/>The curse also comes across as more dark with the servants all slowly losing their humanity as time goes on and being rendered inanimate objects by the time all the petals have fallen. This introduction of actual consequences gives an insight to the desperation of the cursed characters as we can see how this factor leaks into their actions as motivation, giving them more depth. It also has an emotional impact on the audience when they resign themselves to their fate at the end of the film. It also evokes empathy for the Beast who not only has his own fate on his hands but the fate of everyone else in the castle – this makes his bitterness and anger towards the beginning of the film even more understandable due to guilt rather than just self-hate due to his appearance as in the original. The original used this aspect to show that Belle was making the Beast a better person, teaching him to stop caring for his looks and be kind, but I still preferred the remake here. Each film shows a different perspective of Beast and his motivations (the same can be said for the servants) which is something I love.<br/><br/>Another great aspect would be the changes made to characters. Unlike the original, there isn't a single character who I felt was pointless or underdeveloped. For example, Maurice who was portrayed as merely a bumbling inventor in the animation had far more depth and didn't act like an idiot. I could also see the bond between him and Belle better. Gaston also changed for the better, seeming more like an actual villain. He was truly driven by his motivations whereas he didn't seem particularly so in the original so I was never truly convinced of him as an evil character. Other than this, he actually did come across as evil due to his actions more so than the original. As for Belle, I enjoyed her character more as well as the effort they put into her backstory. I love how they made her an inventor and showed she was a truly capable and intelligent woman being held back by society at the time.<br/><br/>The most brilliant change to characters, however, was to LeFou. He was so much better than in the original for the fact he actually had a trait other than just being Gaston's sidekick and you could understand the motivations behind his actions also. I love how LeFou doesn't just follow along with what Gaston says with seemingly no reason and has an actual mind of his own in that he has morals and feels guilty for what he helped Gaston do to Maurice. The fact that LeFou seems to be in love with Gaston gives the audience a whole new level of understanding for his character as it's clear he is torn between what he believes is right and keeping the man he loves content and it shows he isn't simply an evil character like in the animation but a human being who is swayed by his emotions. The film also allowed his character redemption because, in the end, he was being used and manipulated by Gaston through his feelings for him which caused him to be 'evil'. I like the parallels which can be drawn between the Beast's curse and LeFou's love for Gaston – both made them 'monsters' but there is more to them than simply what is shown on the surface; there is good to them.<br/><br/>What I liked most about this film is how it remained faithful to the original, but different in all the best ways. Other than this, the new music was absolutely beautiful and somewhat reminded me of The Phantom of the Opera which I loved.<br/><br/>Some scenes just didn't need to exist though such as where Belle visits Paris – I understand what they were trying to do, but that information could have been delivered differently as the scene just feels out of place (as much as I love the song). The CGI was also somewhat odd and could have been done better.<br/><br/>You'd think they'd be able to hear how bad the tuning is on many of the songs. Watson's vocals were overly auto-tuned as if they were trying to make her sound more like the original Belle and couldn't. Almost every character had their vocals overly tuned at some point in the soundtrack rendering it difficult to listen to. Some tracks are done well, but the mixing and tuning in general just... leaves a lot to be desired. The vocal layering wasn't always mixed well either so it was difficult to hear each part.<br/><br/>As for Watson, she was the weakest link. She had some scenes where she was amazing and other scenes where she just seemed empty in her words and actions, like she didn't truly believe them herself. I wish they had cast a stronger actress and singer for this role since I felt there was something missing from her performance."
"atiyaahsan","9","1","6","6 April 2017"," Deserves all the accolades and more....!
","I'd been waiting for this movie for nearly an year ever since the first trailer came out, and I finally got to see it the way it deserved to be seen, seated in a plush, velvety, reclining couch, in my city's best ""Royal Cinema"" in 3-D. The animated original is a childhood classic of mine; I know all the songs and nearly all the scenes by heart. Going by the trailer, and learning about all the preparation that had gone in to its making, I was expecting it to be a grand affair, and it was just that, AND MORE.....! Everything from the luxurious sets, to the lavish costumes, the splendid dancing and the mesmerizing songs at once transported you to another world. I felt like I was watching a grand re-enactment of a Broadway musical and not a live- action version of a Disney animation. I kid you not when I say that I had the silliest grin plastered across my face every time a familiar song number came on, as I knew all the lyrics and every time an usher saw me singing along to the tune, they thought I was beckoning them to order food service. I believe Luke Evans a.k.a Gaston deserves a special mention; his role was strong and he portrayed it perfectly. Kevin Kline's contribution was limited. It's a shame we didn't get to see Emma Thompson (Mrs. Potts) and Ian McKellen (Mr. Cogsworth) spend much time on screen in their human forms but their household crockery/furniture versions were also effectively entertaining (especially Ewan McGregor as Lumiere). I have to admit, I wasn't completely sold on Emma Watson playing Bella as I felt she lacked the natural charm to portray Bella as a personable character and I'm afraid she did fall rather short in the beginning but I confess she'd won me over by the end and she and Dan Stevens made a lovely couple. I could tell they had put in considerable effort to master the dance moves in the ballroom scenes which were elevated to an ethereal level with their elegant outfits, the timeless music and their effortless gliding across the ballroom floor. All in all, it was a truly magical film as is the trademark of most Disney productions and I recommend all mothers take their daughters to see this film and share this amazingly delightful experience."
"julia-gliz","9","1","6","5 April 2017"," Nice adaptation of Disney animation
","It is really beautiful and nice adaptation of one of my favorite Disney animations. Very colorful and relaxing. Although I struggle to watch Watson in role of Belle. Wasn't anyone better? She was OK in total, but she just doesn't look like beautiful Belle. On other part Stevens really surprised me, he was just copy of Adam."
"elijahdude-35461","9","1","6","3 April 2017"," Don't believe the negativity
","So, I have a bit to say. Some is about the movie, but most is about the horrible reviews it has been getting.<br/><br/>I'll start with my opinion of it: I really enjoyed it. It was fun and full of heart, like the original; not perfect, but what is? The misfires for me came in two places: Emma Watson as Belle and the ballroom scene. Emma Watson is a fine actress, but I've always felt that her range was a bit small. Her reactions to Gaston's advances at the beginning of the movie are pretty much the same as her reactions to him shooting the Beast at the end. That shouldn't be the case. And the ballroom scene... We'll, the camera work and direction just felt lacking because of the fantastic work of the original.<br/><br/>However, that brings me to my main thrust: all of the 1-3 star reviews here. Why? Well, after about 5 or so hours of reading, I've boiled it down to a few common threads: perception of Emma's singing, the Beast's CGI, and the lack of that ever elusive ""charm"" or ""spirit"" of the original. Firstly, there are a lot of people crying ""Autotune! Emma's been Autotuned cause she can't sing!!"" I'm not going to claim to be an expert on Autotune. However, I have been around great singers my whole life, and I'll say this: if she was Autotuned, it was slight. Her performance sounds like an above average (but not great) singer whose vocal coach focuses on polish over emotion in the performance. Second, the Beast's CGI was just like Shere Khan's in Jungle Book: magnificent and detailed, with an emphasis on movement of hair and moisture on it. Lastly, lack of ""charm."" I thought I understood that, but when people started talking about Bill Murray having ""charm,"" I was lost. Then I realized: ""charm"" is subjective, unquantifiable, and is often informed by predetermined bias; in other words, if you go looking for ""charm,"" you'll find it where you want to, and nowhere else.<br/><br/>All of this, however, boils down even further to one shining ray of truth: 90s kids think that their generation was the peak of culture, and that art, music, and culture is just going downhill. That belief leads them to look at the 1991 movie (which was fantastic) as the gold- standard that they have an interest in maintaining. So, nothing will be as good as it was; if this one is, then movies are getting better, not worse, and their time wasn't the peak of culture.<br/><br/>Tl;Dr: Ignore the 1-3 star reviews, this movie was fan-freaking-tastic and definitely worth the watch."
"bodhi-13262","9","1","6","3 April 2017"," Only 'True Love' can break the spell.
","'Beauty and the Beast' is Disney's take on retelling their classic 1991 animated feature in a live-action version. Introducing an all new cast but familiar beats, and with a perfect blue-print to follow, does this version recapture that of it's predecessor?<br/><br/>1. First and foremost, if you are a fan of the 1991 film, you must try your best to see this film with an open mind. Although the plot in the same and the story unfolds the exact same way, there are still changes and different variations of things here and there. Everyone's main complaint is the look of the Beast (Dan Stevens). I would agree that he should have more of a vicious look, but the more I thought about it, if the original design of the beast from the animated film was translated into live-action, he would have been too terrifying and scare the daylights out of the younger audiences. In that sense, I can see why Disney altered him to be more subtle in appearance for that reason.<br/><br/>2. Alan Menken (the veteran Disney composer) returns to score this film, and he does yet another fantastic job in recreating his original songs for the new cast. The movie is approximately 120mins, and this can be in part to the addition of a couple new songs as well as more fleshed out back-stories, especially that of Belle and the Beast. Another complaint that crossed my ears, was the casting of Ewan McGregor as Lumiere, having been criticized for his shaky French accent judging by the trailers. Need not worry, you completely forget about your doubts when you see him on screen. Not only are the CGI effects fantastic, but Lumiere completely steals the show whenever he is on screen, especially during the ""Be Our Guest"" song and dance number.<br/><br/>3. The movie however, is not without flaws. To begin with, as beautiful as Emma Watson might be, she in no way captures the spirit of Belle. Coming to her father's rescue a couple times doesn't quite sell the point that she is as brave and courageous as she's supposed to be. She only skims the surface of the character without bringing much depth to it at all. Dan Steven as the 'Beast' however, shows more conviction in his role as the cursed Prince. His persona and feeling of a tortured soul comes closest to that of Robby Benson who voiced the Beast in the original. Sharing (a little but not as bad) the same lack of character depth as Emma Watson, Luke Evans (to me) feels slightly miscast as the handsome yet egotistical Gaston.<br/><br/>4. I applaud Bill Condon's direction as I was blown away by every theatrical song/dance sequences in this film. Of course the most outstanding being the classic ballroom scene which brought tears to my eyes. I also appreciate that the Beast finally gets to perform his own solo song which expressed his inner struggle of both anger and compassion. Something which was clearly missing from the animated film. There is no arguing with Disney especially when it comes to their CGI department, because they can do no wrong. The production design in beyond incredible with not a hair out of place. The magic is surely recaptured whether you admit it or not. This and 'The Jungle Book' surely stand out in Disney's live-action line-up thus far. <br/><br/>Fans will undoubtedly nitpick this film as much as they can simply because the animated one is sheer perfection in their eyes. Not saying it's not, but it be unwise not to give this version a chance, because it does it's best and delivers beat for beat in a spectacular way:)"

","The 1991 original Disney cartoon was the first full-length animated film to be nominated the Oscar for Best Picture, and following from Alice in Wonderland, Cinderella and The Jungle Book it becomes the next Disney classic to get the live action remake treatment, directed by Bill Condon (Gods and Monsters, Chicago, Dreamgirls). Basically somewhere in France, an enchantress disguised as an old beggar woman asks a selfish prince (apparently named Adam) (Downton Abbey's Dan Stevens) for shelter and offers a rose in exchange, he refuses and turns her away twice, she reveals her true beauty, but for his arrogance she punishes the prince, transforming him into a hideous beast, all his servants are turned into living inanimate objects, and all memory of the kingdom is erased from the memories of the villagers. His only way to see the outside world is through a magic mirror, and the enchanted rose remains, to break the spell the prince must learn to love another, and earn their love in return, before the last petal of the rose falls, or he will be doomed to remain a beast for all time, and the servants will become their respective objects forever. Years later, in the village of Villeneuve, Belle (Emma Watson) is the beautiful but unusual daughter of artist and tinkerer Maurice (Kevin Kline), she is appalled by the arrogance and narcissism of celebrated former soldier Gaston (Luke Evans), who seeks her hand in marriage. On a trip to the market to sell music boxes, Maurice and his horse Philippe get lost in the forest, following an attack by wolves, they finds the secluded castle of the Beast, Maurice ends up locked in a chamber as a prisoner, for attempting to steal a rose, for Belle, from the garden.

Belle meets and becomes friends with the servants of the castle, including candle stick formed Lumière (Ewan McGregor), carriage clock formed Cogsworth (Sir Ian McKellen) and teapot formed Mrs. Potts (Emma Thompson). Wandering the castle she finds the forbidden west wing, and the enchanted rose, the Beast is enraged, Bell frightened runs away, the Beast saves her from an attack by the wolves, and when he is injured during the fight, she assists him back at the castle and nurses him back to health. Belle and the Beast form a friendship, and the servants are convinced she may be the one to help break the curse, the Beast allows her access to the library, filled with hundreds of books, she may be developing feelings, but remains uncertain due to her imprisonment. The Beast shows Belle a gift given to him by the enchantress, a book that takes a person wherever they want in the world, Belle uses it to take herself and the Beast to a small house in Paris, where she used to live with her parents as an infant, through this she learns her Mother (Zoe Rainey) died of the plague, the Beast comforts her. Meanwhile Maurice has returned to Villeneuve, the villagers believe him to be crazy, ranting about a beast, but Gaston offers to help him, but reveals his true intention is to marry Belle, Maurice refuses. Gaston leaves Maurice tied up in the forest to die, but he is rescued by hermit Agathe (Hattie Morahan), he returns to village and openly accuses Gaston of his crime, but Gaston convinces the townsfolk this is more crazy ramblings, they plan to send Maurice to an asylum. Belle and the Beast have become much closer, sharing a romantic dance, but she discovers her father's predicament using the magic mirror, the Beast allows her to leave to save him, he gives her the mirror to look back and remember him with, the Beast realises he truly loves Belle. At Villeneuve, Belle proves Maurice's sanity by revealing the Beast in the mirror, Gaston realises she has feelings for the Beast and rallies the villagers to go to the castle and kill the Beast, Belle and Maurice are locked in a wagon. During the ensuing fight at the castle, Gaston's companion LeFou (Josh Gad) sides with the servants when Gaston abandons him, the Beast is initially to depressed to fight back, but Gaston attacks the Beast, the Beast regains his will seeing that Belle has returned, he corners Gaston, but spares his life. The Beast reunites with Belle, but Gaston fatally shoots him, before falling to his death as a bridge collapses, the Beast dies as the last rose petal falls, and all servants are turned into their respective objects. Belle professes her love to the Beast, Agathe watching reveals herself as the enchantress and breaks the curse, the Beast is returned to human form, and the servants and castle are restored to their true forms, also the memories of the villagers are restored, with some recognising the servants, the prince and Belle embrace, and everyone in the kingdom dances happily. Also starring Stanley Tucci as Maestro Cadenza, Audra McDonald as Madame Garderobe, Nathan Mack as Chip, Gugu Mbatha-Raw as Plumette, Gerard Horan as Jean the Potter and Adrian Schiller as Monsieur D'arque. Watson is beautiful and sings well, Stevens is good as the Beast, Evans milks the pantomime style villain, and the supporting cast are great as well, it follows primarily the same format, with only subtle changes, the recognisable songs remain, including ""Be Our Guest"", ""Something There"" and ""Beauty and the Beast"", plus great brand new songs, including the wonderful ""Evermore"", the costume design, production and special effects are brilliant, and the love story element is believable, it may be more style over substance, but all of the family will definitely enjoy it, it is a most entertaining musical romantic fantasy. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Costume Design and Best Production Design, and it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Costume Design and Best Production Design. Very good!"

","*** THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS***<br/><br/>Well, i love this movie to be honest. You know, my lovely Lumiere, Cogsworth, Mrs. Potts, Chip, etc are real! They're real and its magical. I know it using a lot of CGI, but that's no problem. I am a Disney's fans and i know they're always using CGI in every single movie. But, i can't gave this movie 10/10 because there is something distract me.<br/><br/>I just watched Beauty and The Beast (animation version) one week before i watched the live-action version. I still remember each detail on animated version. You know. When the beast become a human, he used a fit shirt. And he has a really big muscle (on animated version). But, in the live action, when the beast became a human, he used the over-sized shirt and his muscle is gone. I know maybe Disney wanna make this scene become make sense. Because the Beast has a big body and Kyle Kingston is smaller than the Beast. But overall it's good. I like Dan Stevens. He is handsome. And Emma Watson as Belle, OMG she is definitely a real belle! although sometime i still remember her role as Hermione. <br/><br/>The cast and role is perfect. And the song, to be honest, i love this version more than 1991 version. Luke Evans as Gaston, he is handsome, strong, but annoying in the same time. He can brought that whole package in Gaston's personality. And i admit, Josh Gad as Le Fou is really helped Gaston. I mean, he gave a power and soul into the atmosphere so the story became more alive. Overall, it's good. I love it."
"harrypotterloony","9","1","6","28 March 2017"," A beautifully nostalgic movie
","The live action version of Beauty and the Beast is a remarkable movie, with a lot of roses blooming with every scene played out. The cast was spot on, the VFX was remarkable, the music was nothing short of brilliant and the nostalgia was just right. This movie cannot be of course compared to the original because as I said, it stands out from its original material and delivers its own magic. It re-freshens the story with an incredible soul and a heart that is beastly in its grandeur, humor, romance and nostalgia.While some of the critics view Disney as playing off of our nostalgic senses and giving us ""a mediocre, poorly made movie"", I disagree wholeheartedly. This movie is more than just a nostalgic call to when the original movie came out and how perfect it is. Yes, nostalgia plays a part in it but at the end of the day, this new live action version stands on its own and delivers a strong performance worthy of the effort put into making it. The feelings I got when I first watched the original were a major part in why I went to see the movie – and why others will too – but that's because nostalgia is all man needs nowadays; to remember that beauty lies within. Kudos to the art direction team behind the sets in the Beast's Castle! They manage to create an architectural wonder by mixing whimsically dizzying features to the castle with the brooding, Gothic atmosphere that seems to loom over the snow/ice covered grounds. The Castle is a portrayal of the darkness and despair that seem to have a hold on the Beast's heart, adding more depth into the structure of the Castle. Alan Menken, who won an Oscar for the score of the original Beauty and the Beast, was back to add his charm, expertise and soul into the music behind the movie. For those of you who are familiar with the music, it is pretty much the same as the original one which was already super perfect. The songs have been executed quite nicely with three new songs added as a tribute to the late Howard Ashman, whose work on the Beauty and the Beast Soundtrack is just phenomenal. While we were expecting Belle to woo us with her singing or at least Emma Thompson with her warmth, we were delightedly surprised with Dan Stevens' deep tenor- like vocals. This was the only scene in the entire movie that I was dreading would be horribly executed and instead, I had tears rolling down my cheeks with a big fat smile on my face. The iconic yellow dress (which was altered from the original and meant to show how different this century's Belle is), the ballroom, the song sung by Emma Thompson, the dance itself; it was just made perfectly. The atmosphere of the dance, knowing that the Beast was hoping that this would be the night he would tell her how he feels about her; again, just perfect! Also, a huge nod to the creative team behind the ""Be Our Guest"" sequence; it was magical! That scene brought tears to my eyes as well: it was colorful, dizzyingly dazzling, filled with spirit, laughter and brought me back to the essence of the original ""Be Our Guest"". I was singing it out loud in the movie theater."

","Personally I loved the movie. The CGI of Beast's face really wasn't THAT distracting. Sure, it didn't look the most lifelike but every movie has its flaws. Emma Watson was OK for the role of Belle. I didn't love her voice, but her acting was OK. She's better at portraying Hermione than Belle for sure. She wasn't as terrible as everyone is making her out to be. If you love Disney you will be able to look over the flaws and accept the movie the way it is made. It didn't have the heart wrenching roar from the Beast when Belle left, but it was replaced with something sadder. When everyone is turning into antiques Mrs. Potts is panicking trying to find Chip to see him one last time, but it's too late. Now, I am not one to cry during movies, especially in public, but I couldn't help shed a tear or two (or 50) The music was AMAZING. I watched the movie when it came out and I'm still listening to the soundtrack. The voices in Be Our Guest were spectacular. Overall it was a pretty good movie, but definitely not one of the best."

"sunchick116-872-583383","7","1","6","20 March 2017"," It hurts me to write this.
","'beauty and the beast' was my favorite Disney film and i cried at every single trailer they ever played. to say i was excited was an understatement. The movie was perfectly cast-FOR THE ORIGINAL. it's legitimately a line in the cartoon-'if it's not broke, don't fix it'. so why did we need to fix a perfect cartoon and make it a Politically correct family friendly movie? half of the beauty and charm of the cartoon original is that it really isn't for kids, at all. from Gaston's chauvisnistic (but hysterical) lines, to an actual terrifying Beast, toning it down was a major mistake. However, that may be casting's fault so let's break it down. Emma Watson was the perfect Belle. I was a little worried when they said they were making her a pro-active princess, as she was already kick ass enough in the original and even more might make her obnoxious, but thankfully the changes were subtle. Luke Evans was a deliciously evil Gaston. Imagine how much more perfect he would have been had he would have been allowed to do what Gaston did in the original? and Josh Gad. a PERFECT Lefou, but let's be real. when you hear Josh Gad has been cast as Lefou, you look forward to two years down the line when he has to stand outside in the snow dressed like a snowman. erasing any trace of snow and rewriting LeFou's comedy was a HUGE mistake, as funny as he still was. <br/><br/>now, the mistakes. Dan Stevens was miscast as the Beast, unless he was intentionally supposed to be a softie. Robbie Benson's powerful voice in the original frightens you to death, while Stevens' portrayal makes you roll your eyes. maybe that was the point, i don't know, but i do know that by making both gaston and beast softer characters, it's not as much a competition for Belle. The rest of the cast was fine. you really can't go wrong with anyone and no one did anything to really make themselves stand out either. <br/><br/>Now, i will admit, this film still made me emotional. I cried from 'evermore' (A+ decision to add that song) until the end of the film, but i was still expecting more. when i watch the cartoon, i'm a mess from the moment the music starts. which brings me to the music. You can't go wrong with it in this film, and I noticed something a lot of others are pointing out: it is so NICE to have actors who ENUNCIATE and to finally know what the lyrics to the song are. i'm 31 and i found out i'm singing the songs wrong because the animation isn't as clear. LOL as for the changes made to the songs, again PC decisions. the new lyrics were fine, and funny, but like i said, much more for kids. we can show two guys dancing but we need to cut out 'and every last inch of me is covered in hair?'. AND ON THAT NOTE, the director was such an idiot for opening his mouth about that 'gay moment'. it was a point second of Lefou dancing with a man, something not common in those days. WHY EVEN SAY ANYTHING? <br/><br/>Overall, I still enjoyed the film, I just can't give it the 10/10 i give the animation."

","I remember watching the animated 1991 film and hearing Angela Lansbury who played Mrs. Potts in the film sang the wonderful song beauty and the beast which is this time around sung by Audra McDonnell. I will say Emma Watson was great as belle since she looks the part and has a great singing voice. Josh gad was hilarious as Lefou the sidekick of the vain gaston who is gay in this version which brought up lots of controversy. I will say while it stays faithful to the animated film, but I will say that it was rather dark."
"Equalizer16","7","1","6","18 March 2017"," Disney can still work the magic even out of the animation studio, and 26 years later after a treasured classic.
","Bill Condon (Dreamgirls, The Fifth Estate, and Mr Holmes) re-invents the wonderfully powerful fantasy tale of Beauty and the Beast, continuing Disney's mission to make live action versions of their classic films. Re-introducing the lovely story of love and beauty that we all treasure, Disney have created a fine piece of work that reminds us of our passion for the story.<br/><br/>As we all know Belle (Emma Watson) is a intelligent girl a head of her time, who is snatched from her ordinary life, into the mysterious world of the Beast (Dan Stevens), when her farther is taken kidnapped by him and she takes his place. But as she discovers the secrets of the Beast's castle and furniture she and the Beast find something that wasn't there before. See what I did? In a visually magnificent presence, the story we love is moved pleasantly onto the live action screen in a colourful and enjoyable experience. Of course not replacing the original masterpiece, the film has its own merits as its own re-telling. These new live action films are not here to replace our memories but show them in the real world instead of animation. I hold that the same magic is equally qualified but with the advancements of technology in filmmaking, the magic that animation could only portray can be seen in real life form.<br/><br/>Emma Watson is the perfect Belle, with no other actor coming to mind to replace her, with her lovely appearance and character fuelling and taking lead of her performance, Watson is an absolute pleasure. Dan Stevens apparently taking the role of the Beast but is too layered in CGI and voice adaptors to tell its him, but somehow making perfect sense when his flesh self is seen. Not forgetting the jewel of the story but the living furniture of Lumière (Ewan McGregor) Cogsworth (Ian McKellen), Mrs Potts (Emma Thompson), all shinning still amazingly all the household appliances that we'd love to own.<br/><br/>Luke Evans steals the show as Gaston , really showing off his self centred, boasting character combined with the humorous match of Josh Glad as LeFou, who's secret is clear but barley as shocking as claimed.<br/><br/>What can be said about Beauty and the Beast (2017) is that a it is a very justified and fine reminder of why we love Beauty and the Beast (1991). Not to say that its not good on its own, on the contrary it is a very enjoyable delight with its majestic music sequences that captures the magic perfectly. But its just not the Disney classic.<br/><br/>The film has added its own additions and side bits, which unfortunately bring very little to the film and could be removed with no difference but are still perfectly fine anyway. At times I couldn't help but look at the film and think that's it was very set piece-y and not as real as it would like to be. Personally I thought I was watching a theatre play at moments.<br/><br/>The Beauty and the Beast song remains as indestructible as ever, but is challenged by Emma Thompson's slightly over sold accent, but does not stir away from the magic. By the end of the film you re-discover the power and love of the story.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, Beauty and the Beast is a wonderful experience that I'm sure will be enjoyed, but just won't match the power of the original, and sometimes too loud in its scenery but none the less an absolute delight. 7.5"

","Finally caught up with this on DVD today, I also caught up with La La Land this week and both left me with the same feeling of flatness. Something just didn't work, there were nice songs nice scenery, etc but no joy, no light in Belle's voice and no light in her eyes. I felt that in the very first song in the village she came across as a complainer, and a bit of an ""I'm too good for these peasants"" feel, rather than just the restlessness of the original Belle. It was unfortunate but this impression tainted the way I responded to her for most of the movie. I also couldn't believe the flatness of her reaction to the Be Our Guest song; where was the amazement, the joy etc, she just came across as ""oh this is nice"". I also felt it inappropriate of Disney to introduce a homosexual element to the story, this is a film for kids for goodness sake, get over yourselves and your agendas and stick to great storytelling and let our children enjoy their childhood without your issues getting in the way. But there were some very enjoyable moments, the snow fight, the library scene, the dance and the final battle between villagers and the castle crew were all very good. I just wish they'd found a different actor to play Belle and left out some of the junk and cut the length down, it was just too long for kids."

","Beauty and the Beast should be called Stockholm Syndrome: The Movie. It loses a lot of its whimsy and becomes slightly creepy in its premise in live action format (which it's not so much live action as it is Hermione staring with wonder at a fixed spot as stuff happens later in post production) and the timeline in how far the castle is from the town and when things happen are all kinds of screwed up in editing. Still, there are worse ways to spend two hours with your kids and the inclusion of Gad playing the reality of his type of Disney trope was a fun inclusion."

"EthanBJones_03","7","1","7","10 May 2017"," Compared to the original it's awful but it's entertaining nonetheless; Would Recommend
","Directed by Bill Condon<br/><br/>Starring Emma Watson, Dan Stevens and Luke Evans<br/><br/>Plot Overview: ​After her father is kidnapped and held hostage in a mysterious castle, Belle(Emma Watson) takes his place but soon begins falling for her captor... a beast(Dan Stevens)!<br/><br/>I get the hate for this movie. Nothing exceeds the original and the original will be marked as an all time classic. If you compare both these movies side by side, this movie will suck, I promise you that. Despite that, this movie is still entertaining. Flawed? Yes. Outright awful? No. It has its flaws, nearly every movie does, but that doesn't take away from some of the good in this movie. If you haven't seen the original(I recommend you do) I imagine you'll enjoy this movie for the most part. If you have seen the original and are going to constantly compare this movie to that, then you won't enjoy this movie. Overall, I will say this movie is worth watching, and I imagine most audiences(especially children) will really enjoy this movie. Also, if you prevent your child/refuse to see this movie because of the alleged Le Foue gay controversy then you have nothing to worry about. They gloss over it is seconds and it won't bother you at all.<br/><br/>The story is a 'tale as old as time' but that doesn't make it any less magical, exciting and enjoyable. It's pretty much the story of the original with a few tweaks here and there so if you've seen the original, you'll know the story and won't be surprised(much) but if you haven't then you'll get to experience a wonderful story for the first time in live action. Either way, it's a good story. <br/><br/>I will say that most of the casting in this movie is absolutely flawless. Emma Watson was fine as Belle but she isn't the best singer and when she is, it's clearly been heavily edited. They explore Belle's character more in this version which I will say was pretty nice and a welcome inclusion. Dan Stevens was great as the Beast but I do feel like he could have put more care into some of his scenes and not rushed things. There were many scenes that should have had greater meaning and effect but didn't, and that was down partly to Steven's portrayal but mostly down to Condon's direction. I also didn't like the arc of the Beast and though it was primarily just a straight line with no curves or edges. Luke Evans was just fantastic as Gaston and plays the part to perfection. He made the role his own and was easily one of the best parts of this movie. Gaston is also just a really great villain. He's awesome. You can't mention Gaston without his buddy Le Foue(played wonderfully by Josh Gad) who has had some tweaks to his character and arc(some of which stupidly garnered controversy) all of which I like and am happy Disney went with. Both Ewan McGregor and Ian McKellen were great as Lumiere and Cogsworth respectively and both their characters stood out for me. Kevin Kline was also really good as Maurice and the relationship between him and Belle was explored more and was another welcome improvement. <br/><br/>On a technical standpoint, this movie is absolutely gorgeous and looks amazing. The visual effects were all awesome, even if I would have done the Beast a tad differently. Both the costume and set design were all really good and looked nice with the time period. The cinematography was also amazing.<br/><br/>While this movie made some minor changes, it didn't add/remove/alter enough for me to say a sequel was needed or warranted. It was reasonably funny but some of the jokes were clearly aimed at the lowest possible denominator. It did need to reintroduce this classic tale to children of this age but some of the kids in my audience were crying and even I was pretty shocked by how graphic some scenes were(as far as making the audience scared goes) and scare factor of some scenes. The action was amazing though and it didn't even need to be that great.<br/><br/>They do carry over much of the music from the original(while adding new songs) but none of them are done as well as in the original and none of them were performed to a spectacular degree. <br/><br/>In conclusion, if you can ignore the existence of the original you will most likely enjoy this movie. The acting is great, the story is great, the visuals are gorgeous but it does lack some of the charm and sense of wonder that the original did posses. Despite this, I can say I recommend this movie as long as you can forget the existence of the 1991 Classic.<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>Would Recommend"
"jarmstrong-96551","9","1","7","6 April 2017"," The Iconic Rose Drops the Mic
","The ""little town"" and ""quiet village"" have jumped to worldwide fame. With a fantastic cast and a well-loved original, expectations raised to breaking point. My favorite parts of this remade fantasy, which successfully combined the old plot with new elements, were the excellent singing and the believable romantic relationship.<br/><br/>I hardly ever cry at movies, but I did during Beauty and the Beast. The songs -""Belle,"" ""Beauty and the Beast,"" and ""Something There,"" to name a few - powerfully resonate with the beautiful voices of the well-chosen cast members. The song ""If I Can't Love Her"" was especially moving as the Beast frees Belle and watches her run away.<br/><br/>I was really glad that the bond between Beauty and the Beast seemed to form a real relationship. In the old movie, it almost seems that they avoid one another and they do not talk much. In the remake, they seem to really get along together and boost each other up: the beast takes Belle to her old home and grants her freedom, and Belle reads to the Beast and nurtures him back to health.<br/><br/>Sometimes the conversations in the movie seem a little stilted and awkward. However, the overall connection between Beauty and the Beast overcomes these brief moments, and it is believable that both would risk death for the other. With high-quality music, casting, animation, character roles, and acting, this movie concocted a brilliant performance at which anyone would love to ""be a guest."""
"mbf-00945","8","1","7","20 March 2017"," Another Review
","First, LOL because the hundreds of user reviews are mostly negative and their main gripe was it was either too much or too little like the animated version. Yes, apparently it can be both. <br/><br/>This movie is a good adaption. I repeat for the half of the public who have the comprehension of a potato: it's an adaption of the fairy-tale--not intended to be a copy of the animated film. It included the classic elements of the animated film as to be a tribute and enough originality to be memorable and stand on its own. The depth of the story line is phenomenal.<br/><br/>I was surprised to see almost the same objections in so many reviews that lead people to dislike the film so to be fully prepared, you will be disappointed if you compare things like:<br/><br/>-More emotion or expression. The household objects faces won't be as animated as the cartoon. The characters (Belle, Beast, etc.) won't be as dramatic/emotionally expressive as the animated film<br/><br/>(it's not a Broadway play and the animated film was supposed to be dramatic bc it's a kids movie) -The Beast's eyes to look CGI (good news--they're actually Dan Steven's eyes)<br/><br/>I actually enjoyed this live-action more than the 1991 film. The CGI wasn't perfect (but it was good) and I missed the voice of Angela Lansbury, but the ballroom dance scene was the only one which could have met a higher expectation (maybe it needed more film angles). Also, one of the main wins for the script was making the beast appear more a human trapped as a beast (He felt like a person--even the same person in his beast or man form). Overall, wonderful movie."

"suessis","8","1","7","19 March 2017"," A Wonderful Adaption
","I have been wondering while listening to the reviews of this latest version of Disney's Beauty and the Beast how many of the critics panning it are Millennials who were kids when this came out and have been spoiled by the era of CGI. I was an adult when that film came out but loved it anyway. The 1991 version was a leap forward in Animation with its use of computer produced art and the more intimate storytelling that was only seen before in moments of The Little Mermaid. <br/><br/>When they said Disney had turned it into Broadway Musical I wasn't surprised because that is essentially what this is. It's a Menken/Ashman (with some help from Tim Rice) musical of which the 1991 film was simply one version. Menken and Ashman both treated it that way and the film was all that better for it. If you look at it from that perspective the why of redoing it can be answered. Like any other well- loved musical doing it again with a different cast and director will always be something people will want to do. I think it's time to see this for a new generation. <br/><br/>This is a visually stunning film. The CGI of the Beast was only distracting in the beginning but once you got connected to the performance that Dan Stevens gives it no longer matters. Like the 1991 version the colors in this film are vivid and bold. The set decoration and costuming are lavish and beautiful. The character design of the household objects is amazingly detailed. The film hearkens back in some ways to musical extravaganzas of the 50s and the 60. The ""Belle"" sequence reminded me of the film version of the Oliver musical. The ""Gaston"" sequence had moments that reminded me of Seven Brides for Seven Brothers and when Emma Watson sings ""Belle (Reprise)"" reminded me of Sound of Music. The end titles even had nod to the same genre. <br/><br/>The musical numbers were very well done particularly the rendition of the ""Gaston"". Of the new musical numbers ""Evermore"" and ""How Does a Moment Last Forever"" were beautiful and fit well into the new version. Emma Watson did a very good job as Belle. While her voice is not Broadway quality is sweet and charming. I think Autotune has been imagined on it because the media has told people it was there in the trailers. Dan Stevens as the Beast is very powerful and manages to give Beast life under all the CGI. The supporting cast (especially Luke Evans, Josh Gad, Ewan McGregor, and Emma Thompson) are all very good. The cast doing the voice parts also infuse life into their characters with their vocal performances. Despite his concerns about his French accent McGregor did a brilliant job with his role. Emma Thompson gave a pleasant rendition of ""Beauty and the Beast"".<br/><br/>While the film is reverent to the 1991 film it should be taken as its own entity. I highly recommend this film for family viewing. It is a beautiful, joyful experience."

ESPECIALLY GASTON! Luke evans stole the show for me. a big surprise was josh gad as lefou because it was brilliant. josh gad did a great job. all voice acting was superb and made it grand to be a guest for their show.<br/><br/>this movie holds dear to the story while also adding depth to pretty much all the characters and even surprisingly giving depth to LeFou. Some songs have been added which definitely did add to the story beautifully. This movie feels very much like a musical due to the increase of songs within the movie so it does feel like they sing way more then in the animated.<br/><br/>This movie was a very satisfying cinematic experience with breath taking visuals from the beast to the castle and everything in between. sets were absolutely gorgeous and every shot of this movie is a beautiful master piece. and equally as beautiful is the heart that is added through background stories mainly of beast and learning more about belles mother which we learn very little about in the animated.<br/><br/>overall this movie was an awesome viewing for me being a whole life fan of the animated classic and i feel this only made it even better by adding more to love that fits so perfectly. it is a beautiful viewing so go see it."

","If you loved the original animated film or if you love the Broadway production, then I think you'll end up enjoying this production as well. One thing I really liked is that this film provided some more backstory on the curse and filled in some spots the original never made clear. The cast is also very good and they fit their roles well. The singing is also good. Emma's voice isn't as strong as the others but it was nice anyway. And of course the costumes were beautiful (although not as outstanding as Cinderella was). But the production design was gorgeous and would be a shame if it didn't get an academy award nomination next year.<br/><br/>With a couple of minor changes, it does pretty much follow the route as the animated movie practically beat for beat. Although one change I thought was kind of unnecessary/silly was making the Belle the inventor. Its not like it added anything to the story or having Maurice be an artist add anything different but they also barely even focused on it. They show her make one thing and its never referenced again. Not even in Beast's castle is she seen working on something. At least in the animated movie, it served a purpose by making the townspeople already think of Maurice as kind of kooky (and therefore unbelievable when he comes back to tell them of the beast). Plus, one of his inventions actually helps Belle escape from the basement. Here, it literally doesn't add anything.<br/><br/>I saw it in a theater with a bunch of kids present and I heard giggles of delight from them, so I think it will be a hit with them. Overall, I enjoyed it."

","Disney's latest live-action adaptation is the musical romance, Beauty in the Beast. Using stunning and gorgeous special effects, the story of Belle (Emma Watson) and her imprisonment by and growing affection for the Beat (Dan Stevens) plays out in the same way as the cartoon. A selfish prince is cursed by an enchantress and everyone in his castle is turned into fancy objects. Belle finds herself in a small town gossiped about by the villagers and wooed by the crude hunter Gaston (Luke Evans). Belle's father Maurice (Kevin Kline) is an inventor hoping to sell his wares at the market when he becomes lost in the woods and stumbles upon the enchanted castle. He is imprisoned by the Beast but his horse returns to Belle who seeks out her father. <br/><br/>Belle trades places with her father but is let out of her cell by the mouthy candlestick Lumiere (Ewan McGregor). The cautious clock Cogsworth (Ian McKellen) does not support the idea but Mrs. Potts (Emma Thompson), her son Chip (Nathan Mack), the dresser Madame Garderobe (Audra McDonald), and Maestro Cadenza (Stanley Tucci) are friendly to Belle and encourage the Beast to talk with her. They romance starts slow but in time their affection grows. Meanwhile, supported by his friend LeFou (Josh Gad), Gaston continues his plan to wed Belle by trying to win over her father who spouts outrageous stories of the Beast capturing Belle.

"andrewpane","8","1","8","17 March 2017"," Directorial Letdown for film with many strong elements
","A solid B. Which is slightly disappointing considering the original film is an A+ classic nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars. Much of the script was reworked and rewritten for this new version, many of what I feel are the most powerful and memorable bits of dialogue were reworded and lost their power in the process. On the other hand, this film added a lot of background action and backstory to nearly all the characters (even adding a few new characters) which brought a lot of life to the production, certainly helping to flesh out the Beast and his servants in particular, though even Gaston, Maurice, and Belle got more to work with. <br/><br/>To my surprise, none of the performances stuck out as bad. Though Watson looked a little tentative during the earlier musical numbers, she delivered a fine performance through to the end of the film (though I found myself hoping she'd be more feisty like her animated counterpart). Dan Stevens as the Beast was a revelation, adding humor and depth to the character. While I thought when listening to the soundtrack that most of the new songs were dreadful, the new showstopper ""Evermore"" was beautifully executed by Stevens and became one of the most effective moments of the movie. Luke Evans made a marvelous Gaston, Josh Gad created a shockingly multilayered LeFou, and Ewan McGregor was pitch perfect as Lumiere. The funniest moments of the film easily went to Gad, Stevens and Ian McKellen, who played Cogsworth. <br/><br/>My biggest complaint is the noticeable absence of the joyous, brilliant ""Human Again"" number written for the original film, cut, added to the subsequent Broadway production, then re-edited back into the film. Instead, it was replaced by a rather sad sounding song called ""Days in the Sun"" with effectively the same theme.<br/><br/>Overall, my problem was neither with the actors or the design (which was stellar; I could have gazed at the detail on the set for days), but with the writing and directing. Whose idea was it to make Audra McDonald do an Italian accent, making all the wardrobe's lines clunky and unfunny? Most of the new songs don't hold a candle to songs written for the original film or the Broadway production. Belle and Maurice's new backstory felt oddly placed and a tad contrived. Given all this new material, it would have been fun to see director Bill Condon take some risks, but they never came. Even the way certain scenes were shot seemed uninspired. I enjoyed a great deal of the new material, I loved the life it breathed into the supporting characters, but they should have either gone all the way with it or not done it at all. Most distracting is that the Beast was done digitally rather than with makeup - it took you right out of the famous supposed-to-be-stunning dance scene. Stevens was on set acting with dots on his face, offering eyelines, and delivering a great performance. It's a shame they felt they couldn't do it practically."

","Beauty and the beast is a total triumph. This is one of those movies where you just can't get enough of. That is how good this movie is. I have seen a lot of good movies and this is one of the best by far. The way this movie was directed was just pure remarkable it is truly a work of art on the big screen. I saw this movie in IMAX 3D and it had stellar 3D. Emma Watson will steel your heart she is breathtaking as Belle I just love her as Belle.<br/><br/>Parents this is a Disney movie, but there is a guy character in it but it is very very brief no more than 5 minutes long then it is over. Besides that it was a great film that the little ones will love the whole time.

"gustavsson-amanda","10","1","9","8 April 2017"," Amazing experience for us Disney fans!
","For a huge Disney fan like me, this movie was truly amazing to watch! The story (compared with the movie from 1991) had its' own touch with some totally new scenes which added a even more deep touch but still, as a fan, I could see many, many similarities between the both. Several lines were identical to the original and so was the way many scenes were cut. Lovely details only we who have seen the original a multiple times could notice. The music was great but I did not really enjoy the new songs. It felt a bit too much with so many songs and it would totally be enough with just all the old ones and maybe one or two new at most. Still, I got a great music experience and with the help from the breathtaking scenery I even shed some tears to the songs ""Belle"" in the beginning and the main theme ""Beauty and the Beast"" later in the movie. Emma is doing a great job and I think she is totally perfect for the role as Belle. So is Dan Stevens as the beast and I'm really impressed of their work! This movie is really good on its own but for us fans it's even more than that. From the story, scenery, music and the great actors we really get the right feeling from the 1991movie and that is an experience worth 10/10."

","Absolutely gorgeous! I have no complaint about the cast, the sets, or the CGI -- it all worked for me. <br/><br/>Among my favorite parts of the film were the little salutes to various musicals as well as other Disney films. By my count there were salutes to:<br/><br/>Oliver!- Sound of Music-Singing in the Rain- Moulin Rouge<br/><br/>The whole ""Be My Guest"" is a feast of Busby Berkeley routines with a little Esther Williams thrown in. <br/><br/>I'm hoping to see the film up for several Oscars: Cinematography, Best Score, Costuming, Set Design, Make-up, and ""Evermore"" for Best Song, although I can see either ""Days in the Sun"" or ""How Does A Moment Last Forever"" being picked instead. <br/><br/>I loved the film so much I'm going back to see it again...maybe more than once. <br/><br/>Note: This film can be very dark, I would not take a very young child to this."
"olga-levin-1984","10","1","9","30 March 2017"," Be our guest? Certainly!
","Over all, I was quite pleased with the movie. I was most impressed with Luke Evan's portrayal as Gaston and Ewan McGregor's portrayal as Lumiere. All of the other actors did a phenomenal job in their roles as well. I think that Dan Stevens was the perfect actor to play the role of Beast in his beastly form, but also as the Prince as well. As with all movies, I always think that something could have been filmed better, or an actor could have done more better. I felt the same thing about Emma Watson as Belle. She certainly is the perfect choice for such a role and there is now a whole new generation who are going to associate her as Belle instead of Hermione from Harry Potter. (Same with Dan Stevens I'm sure. There's a new generation that now knows him as Beast instead of Mr. Crawley from Downton Abbey). But I found Belle a tad-bit boring in this live action. One of the most significant things about Belle is that she is a big reader. She loves books, and this is one of the roots of her being an independent-minded young woman (aside from her being the only child raised by her father). I feel like they could have put some more emphasis on her love for reading as this is one of the primary attributes we notice about Belle's character in the animated version. Emma Watson, an outspoken Feminist herself certainly did an incredible job adding those things to Belle that are empowering otherwise.<br/><br/>Luke Evans' Gaston was one of the portrayals that really surprised me. I love it how he added a bit of a sly side to him whereas, in the animated version he's all 100% masculine and domineering kind of person, someone who always gets what he wants. The live action Gaston has the same masculine and cocky kind of attitude, but the sound of Luke's voice and how he acted him in the movie, I really felt added a good amount of slyness to his villainy. It really gave off that ""evil parading itself as a prince"" kind of feeling. Lumiere is the other character I was really impressed with. Lumiere has been my favorite character out of the whole story since I was little. I loved his rather more flamboyant, entertaining spirit. I also really loved it that they put more emphasis on his relationship with Plumette in this live action version. Lumiere certainly added a nice blend of refreshing entertainment in my opinion.<br/><br/>A lot of things have been said about Lefou, I read my fair share of outrage from people about him being a gay character. Lefou really reminded me of another character from a very different movie. Billy Breckenridge played by Jason Priestly in the movie Tombstone. I certainly didn't have any issues with that, and I think that Lefou added a great deal of humor to the movie. My advise to the folks who are repulsed by Lefou's sexual orientation would be to re-watch the animated version as there are plenty of hints of his sexual orientation in that version. At the end of it all, it's really up to the person as to what they want to watch, what they want their kids to watch. However, I do promise you, if you chose to see this movie with your kids, they aren't going to notice anything out of the ordinary other than this is a good and fun movie.<br/><br/>Would I recommend this film to anyone? Certainly!"

The cast was great, the score was great, the acting was great, and the real life remake is surprisingly parallel to the original Beauty and the Beast. Emma Watson and Dan Stephens did not disappoint. Go see it! You won't regret it!"
"jasonmilburn-28140","8","1","9","20 March 2017"," Did Original Justice, Despite Poor Direction
","I'll start by mentioning that I adore the original animation, rating it as my #1 Disney film. When I heard this was coming out, I was extremely excited. I had no idea what to expect and avoided the trailers because I wanted to keep an open mind - something that turned out to be very necessary!<br/><br/>First I'll start with a few weaker points.<br/><br/>The absolute killer for me was the general feel. It was nowhere near as vibrant as it should have been and I didn't feel enough contrast between the first and second halves. When I found out that the director of some Twilight films was involved, everything became very clear. At some points it just felt so grey and not very Disney-like and I truly think that poor direction held this production back. Especially some of the happier scenes in the castle - I was sitting thinking 'Jesus, isn't the saturation a little bit off'. I know it's supposed to be gloomy, but isn't the whole film really about finding beauty in unlikely places? That being said, the scene where Belle is racing through the gardens after being released was stunning.<br/><br/>Secondly the portrayal of a gay man for comic relief was distasteful and a little insulting. Props to Disney for having the guts to include this, however I can't help feeling that it was more for publicity than anything else. The whole thing with that musketeer being dressed as a woman was completely stupid and shortsighted; the same ridiculous clichè that the community tries so hard to cast off. If you're going to include a gay character, make it a full part of a story and not just comic relief or a fleeting scene obviously added to tick boxes. It was all quite irrelevant to be honest.<br/><br/>Lastly with the negatives - I didn't completely love the effects. I thought the cartoony feel was charming and not something I expected. Personally I felt this worked well - although the town felt more charming than anything else and I felt myself asking Belle, 'is it really that awful?'. On the other hand, it somewhat seemed a half-done job; halfway between an animation and live-play. The enchanted objects in the castle had really strange faces that didn't convey the comforting characters they're supposed to be but their bodies (for lack of a better word) were rather well animated. The Beast was a bit strange to look at too and felt half-baked. There was without a doubt, room for improvement there. The castle, however; was breathtaking and did the animated version the justice it deserved.<br/><br/>An area which I'm quite undecided on is Emma Watson as Belle. I adore her as an actress; I think she has some real talent but I can't work out whether she was right for the role. On one side she conveys the small-town girl role who wants adventure very well. Her inquisitive side is very believable and it's very clear she doesn't fit in. On the other side i don't really think she has the warmth of the original Belle; it was as if she cared more about rebelling and staying in the castle than about her feelings for the Beast. This is NOT a criticism of her acting at all - what she did, she did well despite the poor direction. I just believe there could have been a better fit.<br/><br/>Acting-wise the standout roles were probably Gaston and Lumiere's voice acting. They really carried the film in my opinion; Gaston was definitely more comedic than the original but this was a welcome addition. Lumiere was the perfect host and despite the questionable animation, was still the same charming character as before. I don't think any of the acting was particularly weak - still room for more believability but I blame the silly choice of directors - why choose the director of a cheap, wooden, gloomy series about vampires and werewolves for a vibrant Disney epic?<br/><br/>The film stays true to its roots and whilst it doesn't add much, what it did add worked really well. For example the book which took Belle back to Paris was something that really built upon her character, even if it was a little bit far-fetched. It answered some questions which were left unanswered before. <br/><br/>Something I really missed was the Beast's roar as Belle ran from the castle after letting her free. It's small, I know, but was incredibly powerful in the original. They could have saved themselves the effort of writing that extra song and portrayed the same pain.<br/><br/>Overall a good adaptation which somehow kept the charm of the original despite being held-back by poor choice of directors. Lots of room for improvement but certainly not a waste of time or money. Please also ignore these family-friendly negative comments. The 'gay' scene (it feels like a total joke even calling it this) lasted for probably not even a second and should have been cut anyway as it was totally pointless. Like I said, if you're going to include inclusive relationships, don't force it into a classic and do it properly! If girls were discouraged from reading and learning, I'd hardly expect anyone to be open- minded enough to accept a same-sex relationship."
"owjowett","9","1","9","20 March 2017"," Beautiful Retelling of a Classic
","The only reason I did not give this film a 10 was because it does not surpass the original. This film is brilliant on so many levels. Kevin Kline, Emma Watson, Josh Gad, and Dan Stevens bring so much more depth to their characters and enhance the story we already love. Alan Menken adds some beautiful new pieces that add more emotion to the story. The few complaints I had with the movie were minor and didn't affect the real experience of the movie. Overall this is a great retelling of a classic with some modern twists."

"richard-62034","8","1","10","25 March 2017"," An Excellent Addition to the Story
","I understand there are many people that will hate this movie because it has Emma Watson in it. I also think that to hate this movie for that reason is unjust and frankly stupid.<br/><br/>Yes, Emma Watson deserves criticism for some (OK, maybe a lot) of her acting in the Harry Potter series. She reminds me of Joey in Friends when he was playing Dr Drake Ramoray and explained the 'Smell the fart' acting when he couldn't remember his lines! Some of her pauses in Harry Potter are exactly like that!<br/><br/>Anyway, back the movie in hand. There are some major plot holes in the 1991 cartoon, and every single one is addressed in this movie, giving it depth, background and originality. There is one story and you can only tell it so many ways, so for all the people who expect something original, I have one message: 'Go watch something else'.<br/><br/>The CGI graphics are excellent, the colours and scenery are extremely well done and the movie as a whole looks impressive. With the extra scenes and explanations, the movie gives a more satisfactory story (even when you didn't realise you needed one after the 1991 version) including the castle no one misses, the significance of the library gift and the fact that none of the castle characters are ever missed from the local village.<br/><br/>I took my 9 year old to see this and she loved it. The wolf scenes could be scary for younger viewers (mine couldn't watch!) but she laughed and cheered all the way through. An excellent evening spent and one I would repeat given a chance.<br/><br/>Others may concentrate on originality (originality in a remake?!), slight CGI deficiencies in certain places (please!) or the fact that Emma Watson is in the movie, but don't listen to them. The Beast looks great, the wolves are a 2 minute segment and Emma Watson, although not the most beautiful woman in the World, has similar features to the cartoon version and more than holds her own in the role (even managing to lose the dramatic 'smell the fart' pauses).<br/><br/>An enjoyable evening out for those with kids and for us kids at heart."
"Rstein926","10","1","10","21 March 2017"," The way the film should had been in 1991
","Well the film may only be released just over a quarter of a century after the original version but it certainly is a much better movie than the the original.<br/><br/>Pros Cast made of some well known movie celebrities, Brilliant visual effects, some plot holes and puzzles from original film answered.<br/><br/>Cons To similar to the original film, a bit to dark for children, songs not as great as the original film.<br/><br/>Well when I learned via internet back in 2015 a live action remake of Beauty and the Beast was going to be made I was simply over the moon. I am a guy and even though like Frozen and the recent Cinderella movie it will mostly be girls that will be watching the movie I for one was not going to miss this flick and I am glad I seen it. I waited nearly 2 years for this film to be released and I kept thinking this film was never going to be released but I will download it when it is available via iTunes and I will see it again and again. I am a big fan of Beauty and the Beast and it is one of 2 Disney Princess movies I like the other being Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs which is apparently in the works to be a live action Disney movie as well. I grew up watching Beauty and the Beast that came out in 1991 the year I was born and I admit the original film may have been a bit to 'young' to get the live action treatment as it is nearly only 26 years old but we all know that most Disney cartoon movies are getting the live action treatment.<br/><br/>I do agree with most critics the remake is simply a direct remake of the cartoon as Belle is a young girl who swaps places with her father Maurice in a castle the home of a prince who has been turned into a Beast and must win her love to break the spell before the last petal falls otherwise he will be cursed for entirety. There is of course Luimier, Cogsworth, Mrs Potts, Chip, Le Fou and of course last but not least the jock villain Gaston because after all 'Noone can be a villain in this film like Gaston'.<br/><br/>In my opinion despite the film being to similar it is much better than the 1991 version and I swear to God Bill Condon has made the film the way it should had been in 1991. If Bill Condon was not going to be director my other choice would be Tom Hooper director of Les Misables as that musical was also set in France. I would had also considered Eddie Redmayne for the role of Beast but Dan Stevens did a great job as Beast. He did a terrific job singing the original song 'For Evermore' which I think should get a nomination next year for best original song. He sounded so much like Beast in the original film but I was slightly disappointed he did not speak to Belle when he returned to his human self. Emma Watson also did a great job as Belle except for the singing as that was not as great as Paige O'Hara's but she did a good job playing the main female character in the film. Luke Evans was not too bad but I felt he lacked the body-build Gaston had in the 1991 version but he was much more darker and evil in this film. I know a lot of people thought Le Fou was not that evil but in my opinion he was though not quite at the same level as his animated counterpart. Still both Luke Evans and Josh Gad showed great chemistry in the film but if I was to pick the actor to play Le Fou it be Ben Whishaw as he is gay in real life as was Le Fou in this film. The servants were alright but they never had a quite as a big a role in this film than the 1991 adaptation. For example Cogsworth and Chip don't get as much screen time this time around and I felt also Ewan MacGregor had more of a slight German accent than a French accent but he had fun playing Luimier . As for Mrs Potts her singing just was not as great as Angela Lansbury's for the theme song of Beauty and the Beast and I think either Julia Walters or Imelda Staunton could had replaced fellow Harry Potter star Emma Thompson for the role. Kevin Kline did a brilliant job as Maurice and had much more screen time than his cartoon counterpart.<br/><br/>As I said the film was much better than the 1991 version but the songs especially Be our Guest and Tale as old as Time were just not the same as the original versions. As I mentioned Emma was not a great singer but she did a great job as Belle. What I did like was that she was simply stunning in her yellow ballroom dress. Emma simply looked like a cracker with her bare arms and her hair when she wore the dress. I did not like her peasant dresses very much but other than that she was stunning.<br/><br/>As I said I thought the film was much better than the cartoon version as Condon made the film the way it should had been in 1991. We finally learn why the prince became rude and snobbish and unkind. We learn why Belle and Maurice moved to the village here named Villienueve after Belle's mother died in a plague and what I did like was that each time a petal fell the servants become less human.<br/><br/>I would recommend this film to anybody and Bill Condon you did a brilliant job bringing this film to life."
"StregaAsuka","8","1","10","19 March 2017"," Tale as old as time
","Well, who doesn't like the Disney classic of 1991? I know, many might think, why do we need to watch another live action remake of a Disney classic? Well, because they know that we'll go to the cinema to watch it, as Disney has been proved right in the last year with: ""Alice in Wonderland"", ""Maleficient"", ""Cinderella"", ""The Jungle Book"", and it's only a matter of time before we have: ""The Little Mermaid"", ""The Lion King"" or ""Aladdin"" on the big screen with real actors. So if Marvel is a non-stop machine of superhero movies making, this more classical side of Disney is a non-stop machine of cartoon classic movies.<br/><br/>So, the movie is interesting to watch; because of course you will wonder: have they changed the story? Are the dialogues the same? What do the characters look like (in case you are of that minority who hasn't watched any advertising at all). And best of all: how is Hermione, er Emma Watson, playing Belle? So, the movie is not bad, but maybe is not that good, but as said before, is interesting to watch and enjoyable. Maybe a bit too long, and there are many added situations and details that try to give an added value compared to the 19991's one but honestly, it could have worked without it. <br/><br/>There is one real problem here: that the classic movie from 1991 was too good, too good, so anything that is being made will be compared no matter what, and if we do compare this one, sorry, but it loses. If the cartoon one didn't exist at all, then maybe our opinions would differ. The plot is exactly the same. Except some updated facts: more feminism, black characters, and even a gay one, which by the way, it's probably the funniest thing of the movie. Then another trouble is that making CGI characters leaves less flexibility than designing it as a cartoon, and that is why all household characters look a bit weird at the beginning, but you'll get used to it pretty fast. Then there are the human actors. Emma Watson nails it as Belle, giving her a Hermione touch of course, that will make Potterheads crazier. Opposite her is Dan Stevens who is most of the movie behind the beast face but his voice is enough for us to love the characters. But leaving the main couple aside, there is another couple that in my opinion steals the show; and those are Gaston and LeFou, which a probably the best characters in this adaptation. Gaston playing a narcissist and LeFou playing the unwanted lover, which is really hilarious and a breath of fresh air.<br/><br/>Last but not least, we have the other main character of the movie: the music. Just listening to the first opening tunes gives us goosebumps that we'll reappear at other points of the movie when we listen to the songs we were waiting for, special ""Tale as old as time..."". Plus there are three extra songs that weren't in the cartoon movie that will probably surprise us too. <br/><br/>A movie about a tale that we all know about. It might be too long at some point, but nonetheless it's a movie to enjoy with the whole family. It doesn't matter if you were a kid when you watched the original one or a parent of said kit, the tales is the same, what only changes is the way it is told. Just remember, when you get out of the cinema, you'll only want to watch the cartoon one and be five years old again.<br/><br/>#BeOurGuest"
"bastille-852-731547","7","1","10","19 March 2017"," A Satisfying Remake
","Disney's highly anticipated remake of the 'tale as old as time' has arrived, and while not perfect, it certainly packs in cutting-edge special effects and extravagance that can please audiences of all ages. The film's plot is very similar to that of the original version. However, the CGI effects are often very realistic. There are, however, some exceptions, as the character designs of the Beast and some of the 'object' characters (such as Cogsworth and Lumiere) could have been done better. That said, from its lavish set pieces to realistic-looking CGI wolves, the film overall is visually enthralling.<br/><br/>The music in the film is excellent, and the scenes where such music can be found are choreographed perfectly. ""Be Our Guest"" and the climatic action scene where Gaston's mob storms the castle are easily the two best scenes in the movie. The performances are slightly hit-or-miss, however. The acting could have been slightly improved, as Emma Watson gives a solid but unspectacular performance as Belle. Still, however, Disney does a very good job overall of adapting this story for modern audiences using live action and delivers an entertaining end result. Recommended. 7/10"
"paradux","7","1","11","19 March 2017"," Disney simply cannot resist mucking about
","The first thing you need to understand is that, according to some scholars, every story is at its essence a love story. Even, for example, some the male-oriented actioners can be perceived as a tale where the hero is in love ... with himself.<br/><br/>Second, the original Belle Et La Bete is an 18th century French tale with antecedents, they say, in older literature going back 4000 years. (Wikipedia) Since it is a French tale, it is only fitting that the French were the first to film it, in the 1940s, with Cocteau at the helm. One of my all time favorite films.<br/><br/>Now to the Disney machine. Disney has done this story before. Disney, being Disney, simply cannot resist the temptation to set the story to music. Seriously. If there is a third world war, and 100 years from now, Disney does a film about that, it will no doubt be a musical too.<br/><br/>The story was changed significantly. Add the musical interludes and you are really dealing with a variant or ""fork"" of the tale but not the real one. It is significant that even the critics who love the film cannot help but notice that chunks of it are ""awkward."" Watson is a delight. Can never tire of seeing her light up the screen. The movie however is deeply flawed, and odd.<br/><br/>See the French original. Or see the Kristin Kruek TV knockoff. Both are, overall, better and more focused productions."

He does look like does in the original. I don't get the goat-comments. Well, I understand where they're coming from, I just don't think it's a bad thing. <br/><br/>I do though, have some criticism. Both me and my brother (who I saw it with, both 90's kids *woop woop*) thought Gaston was a bit to...inconsistent. Not acting wise. Luke Evans was amazing. No, character wise. Haha, he was a bit too nice weirdly enough and then BAM he was mean, EVIL and screaming. He was not as obnoxious as in the original(I almost felt sorry for him when Belle turned him down, aww), but much more brutal (I mean, three shots, really?!). To conclude, I wanted him to be more of a villain and with an escalating evil rather than him being kind of manic. <br/><br/>Also, I love Emma, I really do, and I think she did a splendid job, but the singing was... alright. You could hear the auto-tune (my musician-brother said it isn't actually auto-tune, but I can't remember what it's called. To us normal people - auto-tune.), which, I at least, did not hear with the others. But it was good. I reacted, mjeh, and I moved on. <br/><br/>Otherwise: I cried all through the last 20 minutes, as well as some 1, 2, 5 times through the whole thing but to be fair I'm a complete sucker for, well, everything and also, it was just so nostalgic! Oh, and the gay-hint, the trans-hint, diversity and added comedy; just very good steps in the right direction. Loved it!"

","Wasn't everyone looking forward to seeing the real people version of Beauty and the Beast? It was perfectly cast, with an actress who became famous for portraying an intelligent, feminist icon and who was actually a feminist icon who loved reading in real life, one of the most memorable faces from the hit tv show Downton Abbey, and a host of stars making up the highly coveted supporting roles. The special effects were touted, as were the promises that everything would look exactly like the cartoon-and yes, we all looked the other way and didn't mention the argument that if everything was going to be exactly the same, it didn't need to be made. Unfortunately, almost everyone who saw this movie was disappointed, and I was no exception. It did make for a fun parlor game afterwards: my family and I made a list of all the negative changes the 2017 version made to the 1991 original. We came up with 66.<br/><br/>As fun as it would be to list them all, I'm not going to. You can rent it and make your own list with your friends or family. Plus, I don't like to be mean during my reviews, and I think I've been mean enough already. Obviously I recommend renting this real people adaptation, because it'll provide so much stimulating conversation afterwards, but try not to take it so personally. The vast majority of remakes try to put their own spin on the original; otherwise why remake it, right? Nobody is out to upset you with this movie: it's just not very good. But you will get to see some great special effects, and tons of familiar faces you know and love from other movies.<br/><br/>DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie will not be your friend. During the ""Beauty and the Beast"" dance number the camera swirls a bit, and that will make you sick. In other words, ""Don't Look, Mom!""<br/><br/>Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, the Beast is significantly scarier than in the cartoon, and he might scare your children, so I wouldn't let my kids watch it."

This is a complete disappointment.
So the fairy tale ""Beauty and the Beast"" is my favorite work and everything connected with it, too. The movie was expected. But after the end credits, I sobbed into the voice from such an insult.
Director Bill Condon did not bother to control the filming process at all, he did not control the emotions of the actors on the principle: ""I was given a job and I did it."" Actress frankly fake? Let be! Is the script openly lousy? Let be! Are special effects frankly unnatural? Let be!
Screenwriter Stephen Chbosky did a great job with household dramas, but the fairy tale is not his genre. It was he who succumbed to the main actress, when she impudently set the condition: together they change the script by pouring feminism there, or she quits. This ruined the story, and the rest of the colleagues did not stop such arbitrariness, because in the end he decided everything.
There shouldn't have been any problems with music, because this is all the same Alan Menken and his famous melody Beauty and the Beast prologue.But here, too, everything is stuck together without effort. Some new songs were added, and if the solo the Beast or the howl of the Wardrobe is appropriate, then the disgusting song about childhood is not.All the actors had to sing in their own voices. Dan, Luke and Josh showed great singing. The rest managed as best they could, but this Mrs. Potts did not repeat the chic singing of Angela Lansbury from the cartoon. Emma Watson sang disgustingly, it was immediately clear that she could not sing, and later it became known that the voice was treated with autotune, which did not help her at all.
There's nothing special to say about the actors: Lumiere, Cogswart, Plumett and others did not play, but were there because they should, it's easier: there are a lot of characters and a little game. But still. Emma Watson - Belle, this is the main catastrophe of the film, although the actress previously played perfectly, and after all such wonderful actresses as Amanda Seyfried and Kristen Stewart claimed for the role, but the first left because of pregnancy, and the second because of employment, of course, the chosen person not at all a beauty, but that is not the point.
Masculine, an untidy, disheveled girl in coarse shoes, with a tucked-up dress and defiant lipstick on her lips, marching around the city with an elephant's gait and singing about how provincial they are, although she are no different from them. Of course, they will consider her strange. And it is not surprising that neighbors do not want to communicate with her and her pompous father, a former inhabitant of the capital, she scoffs at those people whom she didn't even communicate.This malevolent family itself pushed people away..Emma did not show emotions; she is simply mediocre.
Dan Stevens - Prince Adam, The Beast, again Prince Adam. This actor is really brilliant, he can do anything. But here he was stunned by the image of a plush cat with horns, his lips look like a bow, a tail with a whisk, and fangs constantly disappear or appear when a capricious creature gets angry,he uttered stupid words in the script perfectly, a special suit did not give the actor liberation, there are no complaints about him.
Luke Evans - Gaston: the actor did an excellent job with his role.
Josh Gad - LeFou. It was this actor who saved the film from complete acting shame, in which even the amazing actors were not able to prove themselves, yes, according to the script, he also changed, but his character was not radically redrawn. A cheerful, active and funny person gave out 100% of the acting: award, applause, admiration, he deserved all this and he wasn't given it all, the main character is again not him, it's a pity.
Maurice - Kevin Kline, he automatically worked out his salary.
Everyone is ready to shout that the film repeats the cartoon to the smallest detail, but this is not so. There were added unnecessary scenes that were intended to close the plot holes, and instead demonstrated the stupidity of the heroes. All this is an empty stretch of timing.
Costumes. Most of them were inspired by the cartoon characters, but she looked disgracefully masquerade, not people dancing at the ball, but some Barbie dolls in cakes. When you watch this, you want the characters to announce a joke and change clothes.
Computer trash special effects - there is nothing to specify. Everything looks beautiful, wooden and false. Did the audience expect such furniture, wolves and the castle with enthusiasm: of course, the answer is no.
This movie is not worth a bit of attention of any person, even if someone does not know about the cartoon, he is unlikely to want to follow the strange empty dialogs, soulless special effects and wooden Emma Watson. For the faithful to the original people, this film is a terrible shock. Without exaggeration, he is capable of causing mental trauma. Indeed, in fact, everyone will simply be convinced that the craving for money can ruin everything.It's a shame that some call it - a masterpiece of Hollywood.
To be honest, I would give this movie 0 out of 10."

","Long ago in France, a handsome young prince lived in a beautiful castle with everything his heart desired, but was cursed by a mysterious enchantress for being selfish and unkind. Years later in a nearby village, the beautiful, bookish Belle--viewed as an outcast amongst her peers--longs for more than the provincial life. Refusing to resign herself to being the wife of boorish nincompoop Gaston, she eventually stumbles upon the forgotten castle that's still inhabited by the prince--now a beast, with several anthropomorphic household items acting as his servants. Live-action version of the classic tale has all the memorable characters and songs (plus a few new ones), with Watson a very appealing Belle, Gad an amusing LeFou, along with rich set design and some good vocal work, but the overuse of CGI--including a horrendous (and not in a good way) Beast strips away some of the magic and dilutes the desired emotional impact.

","Despite having made the remark on architecture, it is exactly as Cogsworth says in the initial 1991 Disney animated feature ""Beauty and the Beast"": 'If it isn't Baroque, don't fix it'. He was, of course, paraphrasing the old adage of resisting the temptation to tamper with something which is ticking along smoothly enough for risk of damaging it. But, for whatever reason, Disney have gone against the good clock's advice and thought their incarnation of the centuries old tale of Beauty and the Beast might need some reworking. The result is something actually quite wretched.<br/><br/>It is a tricky thing to wholly put your finger on, but if you agree with me, you'll know exactly what I mean when I say that, after the prelude to the main event, which is the short story of a magical enchantress turning the castle of a self-absorbed prince into a ruin; its inhabitants into furniture and the prince himself into a wolf-like creature, something just begins to 'feel' wrong with this film. It does not disperse either and, consequently, the film never fully recovers.<br/><br/>You know the drill: we're in France, prior to the Revolution; the middle-of-nowhere and a small town home to a young woman named Belle (Emma Watson) and her father (Kevin Kline), both of whom mourn the loss of a mother and a wife. A loner due to her interest in literature, she attracts the skin-deep affection of Gaston (Luke Evans) while, a few miles away, the castle of the damned brew in solitude. In her own domain, Belle doesn't quite fit in; the townsfolk consider her a bit odd, principally for her desire to read so much and she craves more than what she has, which is the same drill every other day of bakers baking their bread; nattering marketplaces; gossip and the like.<br/><br/>The entire situation is put across via a song, but it doesn't feel right - gone is the magnificence of the locality the animation conveyed: the rolling fields; the mountainous backdrop; the wind in the grass on the hillside; the bustle of the town, and gone too is the sense of there being room to breathe that the animation gave the sequence back in the day. Belle, now seemingly living in the town itself and not, as before, in a house on the outskirts further emphasising her detachment, intermingles amongst townsfolk who, devoid now of animation, can neither move nor omit facial expressions in the flexible manner their cartoon counterparts could and so compliment the film.<br/><br/>Arriving at the local library, which is seemingly kept afloat by Belle herself, and despite it looking more like a church whilst sporting a mere handful of books, she returns Romeo and Juliet, which I suppose is another romance about opposites attracting, although doesn't mention the title and so playfully challenges us to keep up with her in that respect. En route home, there is the interaction with Gaston, a vain soldier who has just arrived back from War and seeks Belle's courtship, but she is not interested. Something is amiss here, too - aside from the fact the 1991 animation made a point to render most of the other men in the town old; bedraggled and/or rather ugly, therefore emphasising Gaston's handsomeness, and that Condon's film doesn't even seem to want to adopt that approach, Gaston just doesn't strike us as nasty enough; as narcissistic enough.<br/><br/>Through one thing or another, Belle's father departs the town; not for a fair wherein he will enter an invention, because he is no longer a scientist but an artist, but to... a market. Getting lost en route to a science fair, like in the animation, would be explainable, those probably not occurring very often, but encountering a fork in the road and taking the wrong turn en route to ... a market just doesn't make a whole lot of sense. He winds up at the cursed castle of the prince from our prologue, who has become the eponymous Beast (Dan Stevens), whereby he is captured stealing a rose for his daughter from the gardens, something he thought he'd break off to randomly do whilst fleeing in panic from a tea-cup which began talking to him.<br/><br/>Belle's encountering of the same enchanted setting follows thereafter, but it just never ignites. The red rose in Beast's private quarters wilts and when it is done, the populous will be cursed for all time, but not once is there any sense of actual urgency. The castle is a dull, drab place; all of its interiors look the same, things feel confined. The choreography of the musical numbers is dull. The household items, led by mantelpiece clock Cogsworth and candelabra Lumiere, just aren't as enchanting; have been stripped of all character, to the extent that Cogsworth might not even have been in the film at all. Their interplay used to be genuinely funny, the way the animation had them hop around the castle gave them character - things are just hollow now and you can barely even see their faces. The centrepiece, the ballroom dance between the two titular characters, does not have one-tenth of the majesty that the animation had, and it certainly isn't backed up by Emma Thompson screeching her way through the accompanying number.<br/><br/>Alas, very little works at all, I'm afraid. Condon's film seemed tonally tentative, as if scared of being too scary; a route the animation was not afraid of going down - this is mushier, clumsier; made for families whose children are under seven and who seem to need abrupt shifts in tone to keep up. By half-way, I just wish I was watching the animation again. I'd be surprised if the same wasn't the case with you."

The fact that Beast starts out as a selfish personality with anger issues and imprisons Belle should mean the story should be about Belle running away from him and rejecting all the rubbish suitors in the story not about captor and prisoner falling in love with a little beastiality thrown in. I think if Emma couldn't sing in tune they should have allowed a few dud notes, got an actress that can sing or got Emma to mime someone elses voice but the auto-tuner sounds sooo awful.

","As a child, I dreamed of being a princess. You can imagine my excitement when Disney announced they were bringing one of their princess films to life but even better it would be Beauty and the Beast. Belle was my all-time favorite princess with her overwhelming amount of kindness, her ability to stand her ground, and her sacrifice for those she loves. She was a role model to me. The live action announced their cast and I was skeptical but excited because of their beautiful recreation of Cinderella. I doubted the possibility of failure when it came to the magnificent story tellers that Disney has. However, the live action Beauty and the Beast would fall short ultimately leaving me disappointed and begging Disney to try again. It was a film filled with the overuse of computer-generated technology, a lifeless portrayal in acting skills, the overuse of auto-tune instead of actual singing, and overshadowing the film with new themes that don't present themselves. I would give this film and overall 3/10 stars.
Beauty and the Beast is a tale as old as time. Generations have shared their love for the story that teaches us to look beyond appearance but at the heart. It tells the tale of a young gal named Belle who lives with her quirky father. She is seen as unique among her town but her beauty surpasses all those around her truly captivating them. She has even caught the attention of a handsome yet conceited fellow who attempts to persuade the Belle to marry him. Her father sets out on a journey and her request upon his return is a single rose. Along the way her father gets lost and seeks refuge in a lone castle he stumbles upon. He is welcomed by enchanted house supplies who help make his stay pleasant but their master isn't keen on their new guest. The beast decides it is best to lock her father away. Belle soon learns of her father's disappearance and sets out to find him. Once she learns of what has happened she sacrifices herself out of unconditional love for her father. He pleads with her not do this but the Beast who needs true love to break the curse he and his servants are under. He obliges and takes her instead because he is in awe of Belle's willingness to give up everything for her father. Belle in her time will learn to see past simply appearance and the Beast will learn what sacrificial love truly means.
The film served as yet another colorful addition to Disney's film collection with its beautiful cinematography. They have many costumes designed perfectly for each character and adds a flare of color to each scene. Nevertheless, the computer-generated imagery was overdone and seems to take away from the natural beauty that the film had. They try and modernize each character taking away from their classic animated versions. The Beast especially holds a scarier appearance than his cartoon face. It is a bit harder to enjoy the film due to their overuse of CGI that ruins the potential the film had.
Disney announced their casting for the movie which caused fans to be skeptical of their choices or caused excitement for what was seen as an unexpected cast full of potential. Ewan McGregor and Josh Gad were both previously in musicals and did an exquisite job when it came to bringing their characters to life. Luke Evans and Dan Stevens surprised the audience with their rendition of their characters along with other actors. However, everyone was most excited to see the Emma Watson bring our beloved Belle to the big screen. Nevertheless, Emma seemed to miss the mark greatly of who Belle was. Emma lacked emotion and ended up giving us a lifeless portrayal of Belle. Instead of re-creating Belle, Emma tends to recreate her past character Hermonie causing the film to fall short with a misconception of who the Belle is.
Every Disney musical has magnificent vocals that will capture their audience hearts. The film had some powerhouse singers casted such as Ewan McGregor, Josh Gad, and Luke Evans who simply seemed to fall flat in the area of singing. The expectations they were given upon being announced to the film just was not met in the slightest. Nevertheless, their co-star Emma Watson had taken many vocal lessons to play the part of Belle but was overshadowed by auto-tune. This being said her voice wasn't pleasant to listen to and lacked the necessary emotion that we were given in the classic Disney film. It would have been better if they coached their actors to apply the much needed emotion to their voices that a musical generally has as well as hire someone with prior singing abilities rather than relying on auto-tone for the star of their production.
Furthermore, Disney would announce new themes such as a homosexual character and a feminist princess that would ultimately turn an audience away rather than draw them in with excitement. It was an announcement that would shock the audience. However, upon viewing the film neither themes were prominent enough to notice. It left the audience confused because of the hype that was centered around these major new plot additions. Nevertheless, fans were relieved that they didn't steer far from the original film with these additions but questions arose on why the announcements were made in the first place.
Disney decided they would make a live-action version of the beloved tale Beauty and the Beast upon their success with prior live-actions they have recently made. It was expected to be a beautiful rendition that would capture the hearts of a new audience and reach generations that dearly loved the film. However, newer would not prove to be better. The film lacked Disney's usual magic touch with inadequate acting, insufficient singing, dismal computer-generated technology, and new themes that were faulty. The film left the audience wanting more and disappointed with the final product."

"Benjamin-M-Weilert","8","0","3","8 March 2019"," A visually-stunning update to a tried-and-true story.
","When it comes to the Disney live-action remakes, there are a few things to consider. While some plots are drastically different from their originals, like in Maleficent (2014), others gained plots that were light or non-existent, like in The Jungle Book (2016). When it comes to adapting Beauty and the Beast (1991), the fact that it received a nomination for the Best Picture Oscar speaks volumes of the story that already existed. Consequently, little has changed with the general thrust of the live-action remake, but it added many details that helped to round out the plot.<br/><br/>Not only was Belle's (Emma Watson) past explained a little better, but the turning point in her relationship with Beast (Dan Stevens) was much more natural than it was in its predecessor. I will also admit that the ending, while still the same outcome, carried a much larger emotional impact (something closer to that of Tangled (2010)). Furthermore, the visuals in this version were quite stunning, especially in the musical numbers (most notably on ""Be Our Guest""). CGI certainly has come a long way in 16 years. Instead of appearing anthropomorphized, each of the house servants could easily be mistaken for the furniture and accouterments found in such a castle.<br/><br/>While all of these improvements made for a fantastic, nostalgic film, I couldn't help but think that it's nothing new. The original 1946 French version (of which there was a brief cameo in the ""hand-held"" torches at the castle) was groundbreaking in its practical special effects. Similarly, the 1991 animated film was one of the first to integrate 2-D and 3-D animation. So, what did the 2017 version have?<br/><br/>A visually-stunning update to a tried-and-true story, I give Beauty and the Beast 4.0 stars out of 5."

","26 March 2017. Adapting the animated classical musical into a live action musical brought forth some memorable emotional moments but at the same time lost the fun exaggerated, lightness captured in the cartoonish display of several of the characters. The most prominent problem with the updated live action movie is the casting of the real human character Gaston whose physical presence just doesn't capture the animated comical snootiness of the anti-hero. The animated version had charm whereas the live action version had to make due with a pseudo-Broadway stage musical production and in some ways didn't capture the dazzling set designs along with the musical renditions found in such productions as Sound of Music or even Mary Poppins or My Fair Lady.<br/><br/>The live action was most wonderful when it came to the humanity of human suffering and pain but as the same time became too edgy in its raw, violent scenes. Oddly enough Kevin Kline while perfectly cast as the father, wasn't Kevin Kline enough to capture the softer and lightly comical animated version. As for the use of song as live actions and the voice over, which is almost second nature in animated movies, since Les Miserable (2012) use of live singing on set, this live action musical seemed less authentic and more acted."
"trevd-22977","7","0","4","9 December 2018"," Beautiful to look at BUT...
","This film was sumptuously beautiful to look at but the whole way through it I couldn't help thinking how film makers today are cheating with CGI. I firmly believe that part of the magic of cinema is knowing that what is on screen once existed to some degree in reality. Admiring the work of a talented model maker, make-up artist or costume designer is, at least for me, part of wonder. I can see a lot of advantages of computers in cinema but I am really tired of watching films that imitate the magic of talented human beings using silicon chips. Compare the images in this with say Ridley Scott''s Legend (1980). Knowing many ARTISTS were employed to construct the sets, make-up & costumes, etc made for a jaw-droppingly beautiful movie.
The movie going experience is not simply watching a moving photograph. It is also an impression of what someone has made &/or done with their own hands & talent. Enough with the CGI please. While I thought this was a very entertaining film, it could have been wonderful (in the true sense of the word) if the makers had not used so much, or any, computer graphics.
P.S. I am not a luddite. I simply think cinema is about more than making pretty pictures in a computer. So there!"

","1.5/4<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed Cinderella (2015) and was expecting Beauty and the Beast to do its respective predecessor justice. I'm going to just tell you my personal opinion: It didn't come close. Stick with the cartoon from 1991.<br/><br/>To start off on a positive note, the visuals are absolutely stunning. The cinematography is lush and the set is total perfection. It truly is some of the best eye-candy I've ever seen in a movie (and I've seen a lot of movies ladies and gentlemen). Direction screenplay, and plot all seem to take a backseat to production. My answer to that? Go tour a real castle.<br/><br/>Emma Watson makes for a great Belle, and she's a great misfit bookworm princess. Also, she fits in to the Parisian born theme of the character perfectly, as she is Parisian in real life. However, everyone else is completely miscast, especially Luke Evans as Gaston. The overly cocky and somewhat fun character is simply overly cocky in this movie. How much fun can you have with one mood? Anyone? C'mon, Luke, you aren't even acting like you're interested in Belle at all. Josh Gad is no good as the gay LeFou. With all of the hype and controversy Disney made of LeFou, you'd think they'd do a homosexual character right? Wrong. They never let you forget about his sexual orientation, and they remind you even at times when it's totally unimportant to the story. Gad's character could never develop beyond Gaston's inferior/cronie/admirer.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, this movie felt too true to the original. When you try to mimic and old glory, it never comes out just how you'd want it. Aside from the opening number (the song about how odd Belle is) none of the other songs have a lasting impact. ""Be My Guest"" was good, but the CGI was ridiculous to me, as they didn't even animate the atmosphere of most of the song. Some songs (like Evermore) have about 15 seconds of screen time, and others (like Gaston) were completely out of wack due to Luke Evan's eye-rolling preformance.<br/><br/>Is this a bad movie? No. Is this a good movie? No. Did it live up to my expectations? No. Is the cartoon better? Yes. Would I ever watch this live-action version again? Probably not."
"paulclaassen","5","0","1","8 June 2018"," This might be a classic tale, but the film is no classic!
","I'm sorry to say this was not nearly as entertaining or captivating as 2015's 'Cinderella'. Despite the great cinematography and incredible visuals, I found it over the top and ultimately predictable. CGI certainly has come a long way and blends very realistically with the real world, so credit to the director where credit is due. Unfortunately, though, I think the film would have done perfectly well without all that CGI. In fact, at times it becomes cartoonish and silly. Furthermore, there's not an inch of credibility to the film. The characters are incredibly bland and boring, probably because they were acting in front of blue/green screens and in studios for most of the film. The characters just didn't feel like part of their surroundings.<br/><br/>When Belle sees the Beast for the first time - looking like the Devil himself - she's not even a teensy weensy bit scared of him. Without any hesitation or questions she simply accepts him for being a beast and even when she's held against her will, she still remains cocky and demanding. Uhm, now that's believable for you. Not! I also found the reason behind the curse pathetic. Such an extreme curse just because he wouldn't accept a rose? Fair enough, the reason probably runs much deeper, but its not as if he was responsible for the death of the witch's loved ones or something like that. And to curse EVERYONE in the castle??? That witch has some SERIOUS issues!!<br/><br/>The love story was also very unconvincing and predictable and seemed forced more often than not. There was no chemistry between Belle and Beast - or any of the characters for that matter! (The best chemistry was between Gaston and LeFou). The attack scene on the castle was just stupid! It was done so silly and without feeling that it was simply not entertaining. In fact, I found the scene overbearing and painful to watch. And why was Beast not part of this scene? Why was he upstairs staring into oblivion instead of defending his castle or his people? So he was still being selfish. Gosh, he so deserve to be cursed! The confrontation between Gaston and Beast was also not effective, as they've never interacted before. It was just pure Hollywood sensation without any depth. It was bland. Stupid. Horrible. And I'm not even going to elaborate on how utterly silly the transformation scene was once the curse was broken...<br/><br/>I also found the Beast's appearance to be very inconsistent. At times it looked really awesome and even scary. Other times it looked like a mask rented from a party supply store. Yes, I know it was all CGI - and maybe that's where the problem lies. Although this is a classic tale, I doubt the film will go down as a classic."

"jeromeghazi","8","0","1","28 May 2018"," Beauty and the beast: more alive than ever.
","In this movie, the actors all shine together in a bright constellation even though I am not entirely satisfied with Ewan Mcgregor as Lumiere. Not only is his accent ridiculously fake but his performance lacked the presence and humor that this character brings to the story. However the animation of the character compensates for his performance.
As for Emma Watson, she is basically the Belle of Hollywood as there is no one but her for that part. Despite a few awkward moments and a singing that she could have worked more on, her performance was overall flawless and charming.
With such a leading lady you need a leading man who is as strong. Dan Stevens may not be the obvious choice for beast but his interpretation was on point. In fact, he was able to find the perfect balance for his character in this remake. With one deep gaze, we can see that Beast isn't a monster, he is simply a hurt man who needs to be healed and is really trying to learn how to love.
I won't forget to praise Josh Gad's interpretation. Le Fou is no longer a simple, brainless sidekick; he is in fact smart, cultured, stylish, witty, funny and yes gay! What difference does it make? Well first, it means he likes Gaston and is blinded by his sizzled body. Second, Disney and Hollywood are paving the way to a more inclusive place where everyone, including Le Fou, can find a happy ending.<br/><br/> While anxiously waiting for this movie to hit the theaters, I was expecting it to be like Cinderella. In others words dusting off a beautiful piece of antique to make new and shiny again. Well, I was gladly surprised that it wasn't so.
 In this remake, Bill Condon successfully made the story richer while staying true to its heart. What he did was simply create more complex characters. For instance, Beast lost his mother at a very young age and was brought up by a monstrous father with a temper. Even before the spell was cast, his only escape were books. That simple yet genius change makes him more like Belle and that creates more romantic and deeply connected moments between the two characters.'<br/><br/> Now can we talk about this fairy tale without mentioning the set where it takes place? Even though it is a summery June in the village, the castle is living in winter. And as the story goes on, the snow melts and it is spring again. <br/><br/> I can go on and on about what makes this movie a great movie and a definite must see with musical numbers that makes it look like a ""culinary cabaret"". But it's time I tell you which of the animated or live version I prefer. The adult in me prefers the live version. However the kid in me has a thing for the animated movie. And as beautiful and moving the live movie is, animation makes everything more magical. While a lot of creativity and great minds are behind those live adaptations, I wonder if those resources would be better invested in creating new movies and let the animated original ones wow us as they have been.
I'm looking forward to see where this magical carpet ride is gonna take us next."
"matthewjoseph-54651","Null","0","1","22 May 2018"," This is a good film...
","Beauty and the beast is a strange movie. It is not a bad film (quite the opposite actually) but it suffers from being compared to the 1991 animated version which is often considered one of the best animated feature films ever made. However, Bill Condon's Beauty and the Beast live action version starring Harry potter's Emma Watson is a competently made engaging musical which can be watched and enjoyed on its own. There are some similarities between scenes which are probably homages, but the plot points have been changed to provide background for Belle and the Beast. All in all this is a good film and as long as you don't compare this to the legendary animated film you will have a goodtime."

The music is great, the characters are charming and for a normal/non-musical ear the singing performance and auto-tuning is not something you notice. Only critique I can relate to is how Belle reacts when the beast gets shot. It isn't that she doesn't care, it's just how the scene is shot, so one can't really see her emotions.

Also the other supporting servants though were not less than the heart of the film but in this again the cgi is dull and lifeless maybe its not the makers' fault as cgi can't capture the spirit and everything lively and heartwarming but all in all its not outright terrible just fine..but considering Cinderella which was done so beautifully ...I hope the bext films are good."

","This visually splendid live-action remake of the Disney animated classic is for the most part, an excellent film. It's a little darker than the original, the CGI is first-rate, and Dan Stevens is a terrific Beast.<br/><br/>The songs are still fun (although the title song is used like a club to repeatedly beat the audience into submission) and the magic is still there (although I would still give the edge to the original). And Be Our Guest is still tremendous fun (also, it's about 95% animated). There is comedy, tragedy, romance; all that good stuff.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Emma Watson can't sing.<br/><br/>Once upon a time when Hollywood insisted on casting non-singing stars for their box office appeal they dubbed the singing. It was a good system. Alas, B&B's producers made a much worse choice; they auto-tuned Watson. And it is painful.<br/><br/>My fear is that a generation is coming of age who will consider auto-tuning perfectly acceptable. Perhaps musicals will eventually be entirely made up of famous non-singers. But for those of us who grew up before autotuning started earworming it's way into popular entertainment, this is pretty painful.<br/><br/>As for her acting, Watson isn't a bad Belle, but I wouldn't say she was the perfect actress for the part. She's kind of forgettable here. And that just adds insult to injury. Audrey Hepburn was dubbed in My Fair Lady, but at least she really nailed the part.<br/><br/>There are also a few lapses in logic that I'm not sure were in the original. And I can't help but feel that if the Beast was being taught a lesson for judging people by their looks, wouldn't that lesson be more effective without the most beautiful girl in the village being part of the equation?"

It's supposed to be an adaption (adaptions are used to tell the story in a new light), but from what my friends told me, it's basically the exact same movie as the original. One of the best parts about the movie was racial diversity, which is very important to me. This next problem with is casting choices. While I was elated to hear about Emma Watson was playing Belle, it kind of sucked to see she was auto-tuned. I don't know how well she sings if at all, but noticeable auto-tune is worse than hearing a bad singer, or even a replacement singer. If she had lip synced the songs, it would have given a better result. The second half was more put together. The visuals and script have improved around that time. The friendship between Belle and Beast was adorable, but I didn't see them showing romance until the very end before Beast transformed. It wasn't very clear that Belle crushed on him until she got in the carriage. The ending was interesting and a little beautiful, seeing the characters go through their own transformations, revealing their human forms.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie kind of rushed through and didn't give many details; like how the characters felt or what their motives were. The acting wasn't great, but it's a kids movie so I can get over it. A few parts were unclear. The main cast was decent. The only main problem is with the art department. I hate to put down anyone's work, but the visuals were too busy and the audio was flawed and overworked. CGI was beautiful and detailed (but overused) at some parts. I would recommend the movie to kids, which is the target audience, but can't imagine many parents liking it."

","Classic remake of a Disney story. I mean, you can't really go wrong with a story most of us grew up with and are familiar with. <br/><br/>Which girl does not want to marry her prince charming and which boy does not want to marry the princess of his dreams?<br/><br/>The standard story line for romance, without changing its original elements make this movie a great watch to revisit your childhood if you happened to miss any. A sense of nostalgia is sure to be expected and personally, there is plenty of melodies flowing and it might not be suitable for some, especially guys that prefer a fast paced or action film. You might want to consider skipping this. <br/><br/>However, those who enjoys musicals will surely find this entertaining."

","Wow! I am amazed at the poor reviews, which only has one very slim but not actual justification, in that the original was so good that it measure this movie against a very high bar. <br/><br/>But I very much think it delivered, the cgi and visual effects were gorgeous, the acting and singing very good. The plot has and message over all has always been a good one even though I get the point that despite the story claiming to be against the outer visual beauty, it is still the material life Belle seems to fall for. The difference between the beast and Gaston isn't all the great.<br/><br/>But that said it is a beautiful story, and message which never grows old in a world which needs its message so much. I was pleasantly surprised by bot Watson, Gad, McGregor, evens and most involved. I am not sure it was better than the original, but I think it was as good and gave a visually different cgi movie with live actors which I think could justify the remake. The music of cause is very good too, though it was close to the same as the original, and so not very original. <br/><br/>As good as I think Emma Watson did with the singing and acting, I do still think she may be a bit too polished to be believable in this role. When she was locked away be a beast, seeing her father leave, if she did this out of love for him and a yearning for true love, then you would expect more emotion and pain, but I Think she did a very good job. I loved this movie and if I were to judge it alone, may have given it a 9. If judging it against the excellent original, i would probably give it a 7. So i decided on 8. <br/><br/>This movie never deserved 1 or 2 stars, reviews rating it so low should not be taken serious. I can get some of the critiques yes, but I have seen what a truly bad movie looks like, and this was not one. I well made movie which I enjoyed from start to finish. Never a dull moment, though i have seen and read this story so many times.If you have a heart and can appreciate good art, music, performance and story which dares to take your heart where few dare to believe it can go. I strongly recommend this movie."

","Greetings from Lithuania.<br/><br/>I really did enjoy the first ~45 min. or so of ""Beauty and the Beast"" (2017).

Set design, costumes, even some acting were great. The story here well known, and it doesn't provide anything new or original - you know what your are getting into. Also there a tons of familiar faces (at the end) and voices, but nothing memorable in acting category, although Emma Watson was pretty good here. <br/><br/>Overall, ""Beauty and the Beast"" wasn't as cheezee as i thought it will be. This is not bad movie even if you didn't adore the story (as i am) nor you like Disney musicals (as i am). Its well paced with some superb production values which makes this movie kinda worth seeing it once."

","It looks like Disney studios are going to attempt to take all of the treasured animated classics made there in the past and transform them into live action films. Well live action matched with CGI created effects. We had Cinderella not long ago and now they've added a new one. Low and behold the live action version of BEAUTY AND THE BEAST.<br/><br/>If for some reason you aren't aware of the story it tells us of a spoiled and nasty young prince who treats a beggar woman with scorn one day. It turns out she's an enchantress and transforms him into a horrendous beast like creature and the servants of the house into various items found in the house. A single red rose is kept on hand and should the prince mend his way, find someone to love and who loves him, before the last petal of the flower falls all will return to normal.<br/><br/>We're then told about the young and attractive girl named Belle (Emma Watson), a girl most in the small provincial town consider odd since she enjoys books and is inventive rather than act like most girls her age. The townsfolk like her but keep their distance and disapprove of her attempts at education. Belle's father Maurice (Kevin Kline) is a tinkerer, an artist when it comes to small clocks and mechanical gizmos. Belle has picked up much of this from her father.<br/><br/>Maurice heads out to deliver a piece he's made at the nearby market but on the way gets lost when a tree falls in his path. He is set upon by a pack of ferocious wolves that attack him and finds safety in the castle of the Beast. When he leaves he picks a rose to take back to her and the Beast throws him into a cell for stealing from him. Maurice' horse runs home and Belle has the horse take her to her father where she exchanges her freedom for his. Could she be the one to break the spell? While this is all going on we also make the acquaintance of Gaston (Luke Evans), an ex-military man with no battles to fight and a tremendous amount of ego in hi being. Gaston is in love with Belle and plans on marrying her no matter what she thinks of the idea. When Maurice returns and tells the townsfolk about the Beast no one believes him. But Gaston agrees to help him go back in search of Belle with his own intentions in mind.<br/><br/>While this is all going on the items around the house that were once servants (things like a candlestick, clock, dresser, harpsichord, etc.) do their best to make Belle comfortable and convince the Beast that this young girl might be the one to break the spell. The stage is set, the two begin to know one another better and the chances of the spell being broken increase. But a tragedy involving Maurice causes Belle to leave and before the end of the story she will either return or the last petal will fall.<br/><br/>If you remember the animated film of this story (which was re-released this past year in a special edition) then you know just how enchanting a film it was featuring numerous musical numbers that remain in your mind like all good animated Disney films had. It was one of the last Disney animated features to not rely solely on computer generated images and captured that flair the studio had when it came to creative genius. So why remake the movie? For one there is a new generation out there that was never exposed to the original. Another reason is that this new generation has less appreciation for the animated art form and lean more towards the computer generated image as in TOY STORY. This is not to say it's bad but there is room for both. In an effort to generate dollars and to offer this classic tale up to that new generation these live action films have come into being. The question is are they any good? Well I can tell you that this one is indeed a feast for the eyes. The sets, costumes, direction and performances all combine to make the story as enchanting as it was in the original. Some new music has been added and it goes along well with the previous offerings. On the whole while watching this I found that it reminded me of the classic movie musical of the past, even more so than this year's LA LA LAND did. Seeing a city burst out in song early on as Belle walks/prances through the streets is a magical moment.<br/><br/>All that being said I think I still enjoy the original better though. That could be because I grew up with the old 2 dimensional hand drawn renderings of those classic characters. I'm left wondering which children of today would enjoy more. As the final credits rolled on this one I began to think maybe it wasn't made for children but more the young adults. Some themes and jokes tended to be aimed more at them than at small children. The movie also had a Broadway feel to it as opposed to a classic Disney film. I would think that smaller children will enjoy the original compared to this one but that doesn't mean this isn't a completely enjoyable film for all.<br/><br/>As to the controversy that came out with the release of this film concerning a potentially gay character it is not near as blatant as some would have had you believe. Granted it adds nothing to the story or movie but if that truly offends you know that it's there but not near as in your face as many would think. For me the movie would have survived without the controversy so I don't understand the choice to do so but such is life."
"jacobs-greenwood","7","0","1","6 July 2017"," Believe it or not, they improved upon the Oscar winning Score (but you have to watch through the credits!)
","I'm not really sure why Disney is remaking all their animation classics in live action form but ... well actually, it's pretty obvious. And Beauty and the Beast (2017) has performed so well at the box office that I'm sure the studio isn't about to put a stop to the money train.<br/><br/>What's nice is the fact that they're adding some new scenes, more detail of characters' backgrounds and motivations, or even altering their stories slightly. While these changes don't necessarily improve on the originals, at least they give moviegoers something besides a rehash that might bore (adults in particular). Yes, some of these alterations are predictable, and even unfortunate, given the politically correct nature of our society, but others are welcome, especially those that extend the story - this one runs 45 minutes longer than the 1991 Academy Award Best Picture nominee - in ways that entertain old and new audiences alike.<br/><br/>Emma Watson as Belle and Dan Stevens (heavily costumed and partially CGI-animated) play the titled leads, while Luke Evans plays the boorish Gaston, Josh Gad his sidekick LeFou, and Kevin Kline is Belle's eccentric father Maurice. Ewan McGregor plays Lumiere, Ian McKellen Cogsworth and Emma Thompson is Mrs. Potts; Stanley Tucci also plays a role ... and all are marvelous. It would be nearly impossible to top the ""Be Our Guest"" sequence from the animated original, but the filmmakers certainly did try.<br/><br/>No need for me to retell one of the most cinematically realized classic stories of all time (perhaps only Cinderella exceeds it?), but I feel it's important to note that the Soundtrack is excellent and PLEASE DON'T leave or turn it off too soon as two of its best songs are featured while the special closing credits roll - one by Celine Dion and the other by Josh Groban."

","Our podcast review features a discussion between Hollywood hosts Ann Elder & Les Roberts. Here's a summary of what they said:<br/><br/>This movie should have been an out of park home run. With a director like Bill Condon who executed a brilliant musical in ""Dream Girls,"" an all-star cast, and a first-rate score, this movie had set great expectations. While it wasn't terrible, it should have been exceptional.<br/><br/>Ann says that ""the worst thing about this movie is that it's faithful to the animated version; the best thing about this movie is that it's faithful to the animated version."" It's nice that this version keeps the old score and adds a few new tracks, but the story didn't seem to develop at all.<br/><br/>The portrayal of Gaston and LeFou as stereotypical jock with an adoring buddy is okay when they're cartoons, but they come across as one cliché after another when they are real people. They seem like caricatures in this version.<br/><br/>One scene Ann & Les both loved, however, was the ballroom dance. They thought it was the director's nod to classic musicals such as ""The King & I,"" when the King of Siam dances with Anna. <br/><br/>All in all they appreciated the efforts of the director and cast, but they had hoped for a little better.

","Years ago I saw a coming attraction for the ""Disney Cartoon"" of ""Beauty and the Beast"". I was floored. The song was ""Belle"". It was catchy. I couldn't wait to see this film. I took my niece and nephew. After I watched it I couldn't wait to see it again. I loved the film. I wasn't the only person who loved the film. The 1991 feature was the first Animated Film to ever be Nominated for Best Picture. It was the first to Animated Film gross over $100,000,000 at the domestic Box Office. <br/><br/>About 3 years Disney had a Broadway adaption. I thought it was terrible. Nothing original about it. All they seem to so was transfer the film to stage without much imagination. Now in 2017 we get the live action musical ""Beauty and the Beast"". Yes it was a huge box office success but doesn't mean its a good film. Far from it.<br/><br/>The story here is almost the same. The new songs stick out. They are just as bad as the changes George Lucas made in his ""Star Wars"" film. <br/><br/>The casting in this film is okay but Emma Watson is obviously auto- tuned. Her voice is very average. That is too bad. The producers should have cast Ann Hathaway or Emmy Rossum. Both have much stronger voices.<br/><br/>As for this film adaption? It suffers from bad camera angles during the final act and storming of the castle. <br/><br/>If you have never seen the animated film then you will love this. If you have then you will be disappointed."
"JordanGMorrell","6","0","1","29 June 2017"," Enjoyable but not worth memorable
","This movie fails to be unique. The story of Beauty and the Beast is a classic and the original cartoon was one everyone should watch and one that is easily lovable. Just add a few new songs and some live action characters and boom, you have this film. It is nothing extraordinary. However it is fun. It is enjoyable and cute and of course the music is good. The film is just here. It will be forgotten and remarked as made and done, it is there. The cartoon will always be preferred but if you are wanting something new and enjoyable then tune into this, as long as you are renting of course. I guess that's about it. Emma Watson is mediocre in her version of Belle, coming across as almost rude than lovable. Most of the characters look amazing and the design in the overall movie is wonderful. The CGI looks amazing with everything except the Beast which seems to look a little, well, cartoonish. In the end this movie is worth watching if you are bored and in the mood for a little dose of Disney."

","Beauty and the Beast is a film directed by Bill Condon. Normally when the film is announced as a remake of something, I tend to watch the original of that. But that was not the case here. I directly watched this film. And I can say that I had a very good time watching this film.<br/><br/>Plot: Belle becomes a prisoner to a monstrous looking prince bounded by a curse.<br/><br/>Story and Direction: I know this story of what I had read in my childhood. Some changes obviously were made to the story so that it sets apart with that of others. The production design and visual effects of the film had me in awe. They were so vast and colorful. I was immediately attracted to it. The attention to detail is very good in this film. Even the beast design and motion capture looked excellent. The songs were also fitted into the narrative very nicely. It didn't look like the song was unnecessary. But I would say though that this is actually not the best musical I have seen.<br/><br/>Performances: Emma Watson shined as Belle. She looked real in her performance. Dan Stevens did also a great work as the Beast/Prince. Kevin Kline was also good as Belle's father. Luke Evans was somewhat funny (in a good way) and menacing as Gaston. Josh Gad was good too as LeFou. The additional cast that did the voice work for the castle household items were good too.<br/><br/>Music: Alan Menken returned to compose songs and score for the film. I was mesmerized by the songs that were in the film. I would say 'Belle' and 'Beauty and the Beast' were my favorite.<br/><br/>Favorite scene: The scene where Belle and Beast dance with each other was the best for me. The choreography and emotion in that scene were par excellence.<br/><br/>Vercict: As I said before, this was not the best musical I have seen. I too haven't seen the original so I can't actually compare it with that. This film was actually very good on its own.<br/><br/>I am giving it an 8/10."
"ragpap93","5","0","2","27 June 2017"," I liked it. The End.
","First of all it is not as good as the original because the original is irreplaceable. The original was a musical and so is this. Personally I hate musicals but all the Disney Animation songs were decent. The music in this movie is forgettable. Why do the actors have to sing? Can't singers just sing for them like they do in Bollywood? <br/><br/>Emma Watson in my opinion is not a miscast as she has that book smart character down with years of experience from her HP days Also she is just over 25 so she is not too young for the role. The CGI was done reasonably and realistically unlike Jungle Book where all the animals were out of scale. I still liked Jungle Book in-spite of that error. The beast CGI does not matter. The beast is a beast what else could it be? All the animated furniture is actually done nicely and those characters were quite funny. I enjoyed the scenes with them in it. Gaston is done alright as the well. Lefou is gay. Finally some progress in Disney movies. So overall there are some faults and maybe some biases but a decent remake to pass the time."

With all the cinematography, music, costumes, choreography CGIs, and scripting are all built to the level of being almost flawless. The costumes totally blew me away and all the voice actors. There are few minor (like I mean minor minor, you can't even notice it if you don't look for it) issues with the cinematography and the lighting, but overall watching the movie is like being in a time machine traveling back to childhood again, and re-experiencing the same feelings and excitement as a 5 years old would, but this time, instead of being in 2D hand drawn, it's with the most advanced modern 21 century technologies... its made to last through the centuries to our children, to our children's children...""It's wonderful"" Belle. <br/><br/>(NOTE!!!) highly highly suggested to watch it in one sitting with the best sound quality you can find at hand.

"refinerychick","8","0","2","18 June 2017"," OK... I cried at the end..
","Let me start off by saying I have never seen the original cartoon. Sure, I owned it for the kids but animation is not something I enjoy watching so I never bothered to watch it. Honestly, I have watched less then a handful of Disney stuff I owned for the kids, Lion King and Aladdin are the only 2 that come to mind, both I thoroughly enjoyed. So for me there was no bias while watching this gem of a movie. And I literally did not know the story so it was fresh and new to me. I do believe this sets me apart from many reviewers. I didn't watch this with preconceived notions of what it should or shouldn't be. <br/><br/>If I had to compare it to any movie, it would have to be Cinderella since I watched that last year (the cartoon I saw in theater as a child). Lily James was better as Cinderella then Emma Watson as Belle, which is a little ironic since I didn't care for Lily James's character on Downton Abbey as I felt she over-acted her and would literally cringe when she was on screen. For me Emma Watson's performance felt a little on the flat side but not enough to dislike the movie. And I'm a HUGE fan of the Potter series and loved her in those. I also enjoyed her in The Perks of being a Wallflower. Her final scene in this movie, though, was excellent. Brought tears to my eyes...<br/><br/>It took me a few minutes to recognize Kevin Kline who I adored in this along with Josh Gad. Both Dan Stevens and Luke Evans did a fine job. I was totally enthralled by the voices of the actors playing the inanimate object. This is one of the reasons I don't like animation. I can't see faces and physical embodiment of the characters. But these guys conveyed so much emotion in many scenes. I thought the CGI was beautifully done. Now, I'm not an expert in CGI like it seems so many reviewers are but I think they did an excellent job. <br/><br/>A lot of what I feel boils down to whether or not I would buy the movie. Being of limited income, is the performance and overall effects be enough for me to not only recommend the movie but buy it. I definitely will."

","This is not the first time screen adaptation, that means every one of us have seen either version of the films according to what generation we belong. Mine was the animated one and then there was a modern-day version called 'Beastly'. Not to forget there's a recent French version made on the big scale that I yet to watch. So it's not about the story at all. It is about the quality of film, performances, and particularly how the modern technology used to narrate the story.<br/><br/>Like the recent Disney's live-actions 'Cinderella', 'The BFG', 'The Jungle Book' and many more, this is another excellently adapted film from the book. Though visually it tried to be true to the original, and that's absolutely great thinking. Because in this modern world, we all try something new out of the original contents for sometimes to mess it up.<br/><br/>Excellent casting, the beauty was the best pick among all. The graphics were awesome. The CGI beast was flawless, yet that usual dark and cloudy atmosphere helped it to be so perfect. Since it is listed under Musical, I was worried about the songs. I truly don't like modern Musicals. But this film was not completely filled with songs. Yes, there were like half a dozen, but good ones. Retained the songs from the 1991 film, and in addition three new were composed.<br/><br/>I did not think the Disney would get away with consecutive successes. Great achievement, and their attempts were very precautionary on their every step. Now this is Disney's second highest grossed film ever and first in live-action. The film was for all ages unlike old Disney films. That's the best thing about the modern Disney films that they have adopted. Definitely recommended for at least once watch it.<br/><br/>8/10"
"makka-00955","8","0","3","20 May 2017"," Just not perfect and too cheesy in parts
","I wasn't sure how this movie was going to go at first. I thought it was a little cheesy in parts, which Disney usually tries to avoid. I believe the Character of Gaston was overplayed by Luke Evans to the point that I found him irritating (and not in the way he was supposed to). He was just too Westend-like and he was clichéd in his characterisation. He turned into Michael Ball every five minutes and over-enunciated his English. For a movie set in France, everyone was, well, not French. We had Cockneys, an American, and absolutely no French actors. I felt this took away the mystique. Having an English actor playing a French candlestick was a bad move, the accent was off a lot. Why producers think films like this can't be a hit without well known actors is beyond me. Emma Watson was natural and not cheesy. Ian McKellern spoke, as always and never tries anything more challenging. The songs were okay, but I've watched it five minutes ago and I can't remember a single one of them, but for the melody of the closing song. For a movie, essentially about Bestiality it makes a good yarn. I did enjoy it, but this could have been made extraordinary with a little better attention to detail, which is Disney's forte and casting. It will do better in the USA, because it will pander to their stereotyping - will we ever get a movie with an English person, who isn't a Cockney? or a non-existent posh stuffed shirt? I thought the CGI of the beast to be clunky and not natural at times, particularly when walking, I think that could have been so much better done. The facial features were also a bit too unrealistic. The story is a good one, the script very good and when Gaston wasn't on screen, it immersed you in it. Then the mystique disappeared as soon as he spoke, or even stood in his West End clichéd stance. He was a mistake in my view. Taking away that Stuffy, cheesy West End style would have served the movie better and although no one else really dropped to his standards, it was still a bit cheesy in parts. If you are going to have a foreign actor in a movie please God cast one from that country, or at least someone with a faultless accent. Emma Watson carried this movie completely, along with Kevin Kline and Emma Thompson, who is always brilliant. They had to get one American in there and he was very good. All in all, I'd watch it again, but will forever hate the badly miscast Gaston and I'd definitely recommend it. Was it worth the hype? just!"

","Petals Fall as a Curse Finalizes. Beauty and the Beast (2017) Movie review. France, 1350 disaster sweeps the streets, artist and inventor Maurice takes his daughter Belle to a small and small-minded town -- ""But small also means safe."" This Fantasy live action movie has a lot to live up to from its astonishing predecessor from Disney. To live up to such standards Disney, hired remarkable actors: Dan Stevens, Emma Watson, Ian McKellen, Josh Gad, Kevin Kline. With such well-known actors, the movie stands a chance.<br/><br/>The film sticks to its roots while branching out. All the memorable moments remain intact: the iconic rose, the curse, slurping soup. Disney at the same time brings new life with ""Days in the Sun"" and the Paris moment. Disney does well showing the transition ""then somebody bends unexpectedly"" with dynamic changes. Both Belle and the Beast become sympathetic towards each other.<br/><br/>This fairytale's computer-generated imagery (CGI) fits in both naturally and beautifully. The animation much like Cogsworth runs like clockwork, flowing scene to scene. The perfect CGI includes hat racks boxing, saucer surfing, and candelabras dancing.<br/><br/>Music from the classic becomes renewed, keeping the same lyrics and oh-so-familiar tune. Beauty and the Beast also developed new wonders like ""Evermore"" that capture the moments feel -- which maestro Cadenza can even appreciate.<br/><br/>This enchanting fantasy film earns a well deserved 4.8 out of 5 stars. Go and fall in love with this masterpiece before the last petal falls this April."

I felt that the singing was great and all the actors did a great job portraying their characters and that overall the film was pretty good. I just did not get the same great feeling as when I watch the original."

","As a huge fan of the original Disney animated pic, there were several issues I had with this live action remake. Namely, the Beast and Lumiere. The Beast's horns made him look like the devil, as well as nothing like the original Beast in the animated movie. Why change that? It gave me the creeps. Also, making him two-legged only, instead of sometimes four-legged like in the original movie was distracting. As for Lumiere, there was nothing charming about his face at all. That too was creepy, the kind of thing that scares you in your dreams. <br/><br/>Thirdly, where was the delightful song, ""Only Human Again,"" by the original team of Ashman and Mencken, that made it to the stage production? That would have been much better than the forgettable tunes by Mencken and Rice.<br/><br/>And lastly, why mess with Beauty's original gorgeous yellow dress? The one Emma Watson wore was nice; it just wasn't Beauty's.<br/><br/>So, I would not take little children to this movie. Let them enjoy the original animated feature or the stage production. No bad dreams there."

","Went with my son to see a movie about a beauty and a beast not expecting to witness a film about the new American president. Only when Belle tells Gaston she cannot marry him because ""there is no love in your heart"" does it occur to me the Gaston character is mirror image of the current occupant of the White House. Narcissist on reveal, self centered, indifferent to others, willing to deceive, defile, deflect and behave in a categorically cruel, offensive and desultory manner, as unlikable as any villain that could possibly be depicted. Thanks to the producers for depicting a character more than vaguely familiar to American audiences. Stunning similarities unveiled artfully."

","BEAUTY AND THE BEAST (2017) I was very excited about watching this film but I finally found it a little bit boring. I think this is because I already knew the story. In spite of that I think the film was perfectly done. It shows all the essence of the real history and it makes you travel back to your childhood. Another point in favour were the special effects. They were very realistic and all the characters from the enchanted castle were awesome. In conclusion I think it is recommendable for everybody. It is a classic film remake into an artwork, and if you want to have a good time with your kids it's the perfect occasion."

","In 1991, Beauty and the Beast made cinematic history, becoming the first animated film ever to be nominated for a best picture Oscar. Now 26 years later the film is given the live action treatment by Disney, following the success of other such films like; Maleficent, Cinderella and The Jungle Book. 2017's Beauty and the Beast retells the same story from 26 years ago, but with impressive visuals and good acting, this film serves as an acceptable remake of the classic original.<br/><br/>The film is visually stunning, the cinematography and visual effects work perfectly together to bring these, once animated characters and settings to life. This is really all the film needed to achieve as the story itself is exact same as the original 1991 animation, bar a few plot point tweaks. Now that visual effects and animation has come along way since the 90s, Disney wants to flaunt this with these remakes, as evidenced by The Jungle Book winning a visual effects Oscar at this years academy awards. Beauty and the Beast isn't as CGI heavy and thus visually impressive as Jon Favreau's The Jungle Book, but it is still beautiful to look at nonetheless.<br/><br/>The acting as a whole was decent from the films all star cast, with a particularly good performance from Luke Evans as Gaston. Luke Evan's completely outshines everyone in this film including its lead's Emma Watson and Dan Stevens. Evans sings impressively well and without the aid of autotune *cough* Emma Watson *cough*. This overall theatrical performance steals the entire show and completely makes this film worth remaking.<br/><br/>Also as a whole the film is well directed by Bill Condon, slowing the pace to give way to more character development and to express the time taken for the two title characters to fall in love. The controversial (to certain countries) direction taken with LeFou was done in such a delicate and implicit manner which was good to see, and also made this film feel more contemporary.<br/><br/>Overall, Beauty and the Beast does all it needed to do. It's a well acted and visually stunning film that tells the same story from 26 years ago. I commend Bill Condon and Luke Evans for their work on this film, and thanks to them this remake isn't just a heartless cash grab. It may not be the most impressive of the live action remakes, but is by far the most enjoyable in my own opinion."

","""The beautiful and the beast"" is a good musical, a great adaptation, with many hits, but also with some mistakes. With a script coming from the animation of 91, we have some changes for the worse, like trying to create a suspense over the beautiful mother, and solve this mystery in a scene that completely escapes the rhythm of the movie, such a mystery would not have to exist or could be solved In 2 min, because such a plot is created for the development of the father's character, but really, it does not work, other small changes were the king's employees become more and more inanimate and the castle collapses more as the pellets fall, that change was Great, more, the script follows the pattern, with scenes equal to the animation - which is not bad - and a great development of the village in relation to the beautiful and the passion point between beautiful and the beast. The film talks about how the quest for knowledge was something seen with strangeness, and the film is completely full of diversity, I am against putting gay actors, whites, blacks, women ... just to meet quota, ""the beautiful and the beast ""Changes the character in an extremely natural way, and the change gets even better. We have a photograph that mixes the white of the village with the gray of the castle, we also have a great mix and sound editing, a completely confused assembly, and we have a makeup and a costume simply spectacular (a sure indication to Oscar in the costumes). Emma watson is not a painter in terms of acting, but fulfills her role as beautiful, and at times even charms, Josh Gad is great, and incredible as it may seem, has an incredible chemistry with the character of Luke Evans, at last , We have problems in the script, and problems of continuity, but the film pleases, and much."

","Beauty and the Beast It tells the classic story of Disney, in which a Bella (Emma Watson) after its father (Kevin Kline) was imprisoned by the Beast (Dan Stevens). After exchanging roles with her father, Bella, is imprisoned by the Evil Beast?<br/><br/>Let's start with the actors. Emma Watson as Bella is a Disney hacienda, unfortunately I went to see her in Spanish. For me the English seat is the best there is. Dan Stevens as the Beast can not be said any more. Because most of the work was done by the effects. But the character I liked the most was Le Fou, interjected by Gosh Gad, after realizing that he is on the bad side change sides, for a few moments. Ian Mackellen and Ewwan McGregor (Cogsworth and Lumière respectively) seemed very good, a very important impulse to the film.<br/><br/>The music is very well used, I would put one point less than La La Land. It should also be said that La La Land and La Bella y la Bestia have different styles of music. This very well used music in this movie, it would not seem strange that I had an Oscar nomination for best song or best soundtrack.<br/><br/>Beautiful 7/10"

","I hadn't seen the original cartoon until after I saw this remake. Backwards? Yes, but it doesn't matter really. Overall I did enjoy this movie quite a bit. I do like some of the changes they made, such as Cogsworth and Lumirie bringing Belle to her room and telling her not to go to the west wing. One of things that bothered me, was that Gaston looked too much like Bard from the Hobbit, granted same person plays the characters, but they could have made better changes to the costume and makeup to better differentiate the characters. I will say this, they really over did the LeFou a lot more than they should've in my opinion. Laid it on more thick than necessaryou, considering people said it was subtle. To me it was very noticeable, and did in their words made him, clingy.<br/><br/>Really good movie, would not gone it 10/10, a lot more would have had to be changed to make it a perfect movie, but worth seeing more than once."

","To say I'm a Disney fan is a tiny bit of an understatement <br/><br/>Where to start with this review? there is so much I want to rant and rave about I literally don't know where to begin.<br/><br/>I suppose first of I should say, oh my goodness loved every single moment of this movie. The goosebumps were constant and there wasn't a moment when a huge smile wasn't plastered all over my face.<br/><br/>THEY'VE KEPT IT TRUE TO FORM – and when I say that, I didn't read the bloody original fairy tale, but I've seen the animated Disney dream around 200 times.<br/><br/>They haven't removed any key moments or tried to make things dark and deep (which everybody seems to do these days) . They've added a little more depth to certain characters and a wee little backstory to our Belle's background, but the tale really is as old as time <br/><br/>Just want to get one thing out in the open – I'm not a huge fan of Emma Watson.<br/><br/>Obviously Harry Potter is life, but for some reason I find her acting 'talents' seriously lacking, so when I heard she landed herself the title role, I did a little face plant.<br/><br/>In fact the only thing that kept me positive about the whole thing was thinking 'it could be worse, they could've given it to Anne Hathaway'<br/><br/>In all honesty though, she is perfect for this part. She looks gorgeous, her singing is pretty on point and her personality on and off screen is a dead match.<br/><br/>In fact the whole cast was perfect!<br/><br/>Luke Evans is the stand out performance in the film for me, his singing voice is ace and he oozes the arrogance and anger that Gaston needs.<br/><br/>'I USE ANTLERS IN ALL OF MY DECOOOORATING'<br/><br/>When you've been listening to the same songs for 25 years, it's hard to love any covers in the same way.<br/><br/>Well that's what I thought until now. Every musical moment is perfect.<br/><br/>From the arm swinging Gaston to the slow dancing title track, they sure did do it right.<br/><br/>When the soundtrack was released, people were claiming the new additions were mostly filler, and I don't know what these crazies had been smoking, but they must be out of their minds.<br/><br/>'Evermore' stood out to me from the beginning, as I always thought that the beast needed a song of his own and this is everything I could've dreamed of. It's so powerful, moving and YES, I DID CRY! JUST BACK OFF OKAY?<br/><br/>Blah blah blah, I could talk nonstop about the many, many ways this ticked all the boxes for me but I'm going to cool my jets a bit now and get down to it.<br/><br/>I am confident that people will come out of this movie disappointed, they'll be wanting/expecting something fresh and different but I for one am glad that's it's neither of those things.<br/><br/>It's not at all a straight imitation but at the same time it's not trying to be something that it's not. To me they hit the nail on the head and this movie is my absolute dream. Everything I was wanting and more.<br/><br/>My rating – 10/10 all day, every day. I have already booked to see it again and I am counting down the days!!!<br/><br/>Seeing it for the first time was an experience I won't forget and I would like to personally thank Disney for giving me yet another film I can cherish forever."

","The live action update of the Oscar-nominated Disney animation, Bill Condon's re-imagining is a sweet, thoughtful and emotional film with clear themes of empowerment, feminism and individuality.<br/><br/>Emma Watson is perfectly cast as Belle and her singing is a real show-stealer throughout; as are Luke Evans and Josh Gad as the comedic yet villainous duo of Gaston and Lefue, respectively.  On the flip side, Dan Stevens as the Beast leaves a lot to be desired (not in a good way), particularly in terms of his - albeit, limited - singing.<br/><br/>The songs remain as catchy as ever and are beautifully (and expensively) choreographed on screen with seamless combinations of live action, CGI and what often appears as one shot camera work.<br/><br/>Despite its 2hr 9min runtime however, the plot seems somewhat rushed and bare bones at times.  Admittedly, this is based on an existing Disney property and storyline, so screenwriters were shackled in many ways to the original material but the plot really felt like it could have done with more back story around the Beast/Princes' troubled childhood and how this fully justified his conduct as an adult (a la Frozen).<br/><br/>All in all though, this is a greatly enjoyable musical take on the classic story which very much has its heart in the right place and isn't scared to pitch at both young and older audience members."

","Yes, I went to see it out of curiosity (like a lot of you, I suspect). But, while it adhered pretty closely to the Menken/Ashman masterpiece of twenty-six years ago, it still didn't recapture the charm and novelty of it. Not for me, anyway.<br/><br/>Ewan McGregor, as Lumiere, is no Jerry Orbach. Emma Thompson, as Mrs. Potts, is no Angela Lansbury. Ian McKellen sounded more like Patrick Stewart (his co-star from the X-MEN films) rather than Charles Ogden Stiers (the voice of the original Cogswell). And Emma Stone? Well, her song coach should be proud of her. But, she's still no Catherine O'Hara.<br/><br/>All in all, then, it was a nice way to kill a rainy Saturday afternoon.

The characters are rendered more realistic and three dimensional with extra back stories. <br/><br/>What I thought was the best change was the character of LeFou. He is not really a villain in this film, more like a very sweet guy who happens to worship and be in love with a very bad man (Gaston).<br/><br/>The same could not be said of the Beast. I kind of prefer it in the animated version. There were things left out and things added that were both good and bad, but ultimately didn't leave much of an impact as I thought.<br/><br/>Another thing I thought was missing was the hilarious banter between Lumière and Cogsworth (""En Garde you overgrown pocket watch!""). <br/><br/>Overall, it's a sweet and beautiful tribute and expansion to the cartoon version, but probably not enough to make it stand out on its own."
"drawlife","6","0","2","23 March 2017"," It's serviceable.
","I'm not a huge fan or musicals to be honest, but every now and then I find myself to be entertained by some of them. <br/><br/>That being said when I was a child I enjoyed a few Disney animation classics and Beauty & the Beast is definitely one of them. During the hype train I found myself anticipating the film the more I heard about it. Emma Watson's casting as Belle definitely brought my attention to the film. As did the casting Ewan McGergor, Sir Ian McKellen, Stanley Tucci, and Emma Thompson. The set photos and promotional images also grabbed my attention too.<br/><br/>I'm happy to report that it's a serviceable adaptation of the animated movie. Most of the cast delivers with the exception of Luke Evans. He definitely looks like he's having fun in the role as Gaston, but he is so cartoonishly two-dimensional and so over the top. I just could not take him seriously every time he showed up on screen. Aside from him everyone does a great job. Emma Watson brings it, and her singing isn't too bad either. Stand out for me was Ewan McGergor as Lumiere. He brought a lot of swagger and personality to the role. His banter and exchange with Ian McKellen's Cogsworth brings a lot of humor in their relationship. I also really enjoyed Dan Steven's performance as the Beast. <br/><br/>Singing in the beginning of the film is a little bit of a turn-off. Not because the actors couldn't sing, but it's one number after another, and some of the verses were kind of pointless as well. But once the plot gets going it becomes more tolerable. In the middle near to the end, the film know when to pick it's moments to showcase a number. Like I said I'm not the biggest fan of musicals, but the annoyance is only temporary. Some of the actors are kinda there without much to do, despite some amusing moments, like Kevin Kline, Stanley Tucci, Audra McDonald, and Gugu Mbatha-Raw. <br/><br/>The romance is solid. It never felt too over the top, and the chemistry for the most part was there. I believe making people laugh and showcasing romance is something hard to convey for any movie. Beauty & the Beast does a commendable job at it, however while I never felt like Belle and Beast's relationship felt force, I wish that a little more was given to them. The film does showcase their bonding, but most of it are montages. Everything set up for their romance was just almost, almost executed with perfection. I also wish I got to see more out of Dan Steven's Beast as well. The film hits in high gears once the film introduces him. <br/><br/>Special effects and production design are first rate. Yes there are moments where you can tell it's CGI, but it's not that noticeable that it's going to distract you. Costumes are fabulous too look at and the actors are well lit. Director Bill Condon does an excellent job showcasing the fantasy land, it's visually pleasing and enriching. The ball-room dance sequence with Beast and Belle is done with justice too.<br/><br/>At times Beauty & the Beast can feel cluttered and overproduced eye-candy, but the film is a very faithful adaptation of the animated film. Aside from a little backstory from Belle and the gay character LeFou played by Josh Gad(which is handled well to be honest), it really doesn't bring a lot new to the table. Which is fine for some, cause why fix what isn't broken, but that works for and against the film. <br/><br/>Among other live adaptations, I'd rank this below or evenly with Cinderella, but definitely much more entertaining than Maleficent or the Alice in Wonderland films. Odd that both Cinderella and Beauty & the Beast are basic retellings that work for the most part, but Maleficent and Alice in Wonderland try to be new re-imaginings that just crumble. Perhaps Little Mermaid or Mulan might find the striking balance of both. <br/><br/>6.6/10"
"MrDHWong","8","0","5","23 March 2017"," Improves on just about everything that was enjoyable about the 1991 film
","Beauty and the Beast is the live action remake of the classic 1991 Disney animated film. Based on the French fairy tale of the same name, this adaptation is so far the best live action update of a Disney film.<br/><br/>In 18th century France, a beautiful young woman named Belle (Emma Watson) is imprisoned by a savage Beast (Dan Stevens) inside his giant castle. Unbeknownst to Belle, the Beast is actually a Prince who has had his physical form altered by a curse. The curse will only be broken once the Beast wins her love in return, otherwise he will remain a monster forever.<br/><br/>This version improves on just about everything that was enjoyable about the 1991 film. The songs sound better, the set design looks better, and even the pacing feels better. The film moves at a breathless speed, but never so much that the story is hard to follow. Emma Watson is perfectly cast as Belle, not merely for her physical appearance, but for her range as an actress. The film even has some moments of dark humour and the occasional self-referential quip about certain situations the characters may be going through at someone else's expense, similar to Disney's previous live action adaptation of The Jungle Book.<br/><br/>I rate it 8/10"
"adam-greenwood","8","0","4","22 March 2017"," A delightful, fresh take on a well-loved classic :) *SPOILERS*
","WARNING - THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS!<br/><br/>First of all, there were enough differences to make it feel fresh while sticking closely enough to the animated original to evoke the warm fuzzies of nostalgia.<br/><br/>That said, there were changes I liked and changes/creative choices I didn't like so much. To get the ""bad"" out of the way, I'll cover those first:<br/><br/>What I didn't like:<br/><br/>Character designs - While some of the non-human characters had very interesting and clever designs, with creative ways to give inanimate objects anthropomorphic faces and features, others were far too simple. For example, Lumierre was a golden statue of a man with candle on head and hands compared to Cogsworth who was a cleverly designed subtly anthropomorphic clock. The Wardrobe and Harpsichord had faces formed from the intrinsic features of their design whereas Mrs. Potts' face is just painted on the side! Over all, there seemed to be a lack of cohesion as if different designers had gone off and designed one or two characters each without comparing notes at any point.<br/><br/>The Beast - While I loved the character, his expanded backstory and voice, I found his design a little bland. I've said from the beginning that he looked like a Buffy demon. I dunno... just looked too human. I'd have preferred a more ""bestial"" face, closer to his cartoon appearance.<br/><br/>Gaston - They really didn't seem to know what they wanted to do with the character. Instead of the impulsive buffoon we saw in the original, he was a capable military Captain, returned to his home village after ""the Wars"". Honestly, his arguments for why Belle should marry him, while delivered with too much over-confidence, actually seemed pretty reasonable (Basically that they were the only two who were ""bigger"" than the village and should therefore be together). Felt like the early scenes of a rom-com where Gaston would learn his lesson and Belle would fall for him after all. He also seemed to nice in early scenes so when he turns to pure evil, it's a bit of a jarring switch. I did, however, feel echoes of the love triangle between the Phantom, Christine and Raoul from ""Phantom of the Opera"", especially the more recent productions revised to tie in better with the sequel, ""Love Never Dies"". Also, they cut out the reprise of ""Gaston"" where La Fou reminds Gaston that thinking is a dangerous pastime!<br/><br/>What I liked:<br/><br/>La Fou's expanded role - From his first appearance, he seemed to be a little more than Gaston's lackey as he had appeared in the original. This is particularly noticeable during the tavern song ""Gaston"" where he slips coins to various people in the tavern to encourage their participation suggesting that Gaston is not quite so universally beloved as he likes to think. He is also the one to challenge Gaston when he feels like he is going too far. In this interpretation, I found him quite like Bernard from ""Yes, (Prime)Minister"" - taking the subordinate role but quite possibly the smartest man in the room!<br/><br/>Plot Holes Fixed! - So many of the plot-holes in the original are addressed. There is no reference to the rose blooming until the Beast's 21st year - he is cursed as an adult and he has until the last petal falls to break the curse although no time-scale is given for this. Also, the reference to the curse having been in place for ten years in ""Be Our Guest"" has been removed. Chip is seen as a human boy before the curse so we understand that all those who are cursed become frozen in time for however long it has been in place. Circumstantial evidence would suggest it has been only a few years but it's never explicitly stated. We also learn that the curse also meant that everyone outside the Castle would forget about it and anyone inside, explaining why the village seems unaware of a Royal Castle within easy walking distance! A tragic element is also added to the Beast's back-story to explain why the staff remain loyal to him despite it being his fault they are cursed. The story of what happened to Belle's mother and why her father brought her to the ""small, provincial town"" was quite moving and gave her and the Beast something else to bond over although the method by which they discovered this seemed a little shoe-horned in and was never mentioned again, despite how useful it might have been during later parts of the story.<br/><br/>I also liked the inclusion of a sub-plot from the stage musical that the non-human characters are slowly becoming more and more the object they have been turned into and less human (Expected them to include the song ""Human Again"" but it didn't come) and, if the curse is not lifted, they will become permanently inanimate, simple household items. Thought the expanded role for the Enchantress was was a nice touch.<br/><br/>All in all, a fantastic, beautiful piece of cinema that will be loved by fans of the original as well as newcomers who are unfamiliar with Disney's take on this well-loved tale :)"

Her performance to me was FLAT and that killed the movie for me.. I thought the beast had more facial changes than she did.. Her face was either smiling or serious or had a little tear trying to fall from her eyes and that's it..not a lot of excitement or emotion of the feelings she was developing for the beast.....

","Being one of my favourite childhood films, this charming spin of Beauty and the Beast was both traditional and original wrapped in a magical bow. The initial scene threw me a little but the more the film went on, the more i began to love the new scenes and the originality of the storyline. Everything from the original version that you wanted was there with extras added to recapture audiences and bring an old story back to life. Emma Watson was a perfect casting choice, people saying she cannot sing - she isn't a singer and i think it makes it all the more charming that she still sounds lovely without being chart-toppingly amazing. Luke Evans was another perfect casting choice and i don't believe anyone could have played the vain and evil Gaston any better. A lot of people have commented on the appearance of the Beast, saying he didn't look frightening enough and claiming that his eyes looked strange - it is fist and foremost a children's film and so there is a limit to how frightening he can appear and the entire purpose behind his eyes looking human is because that's how she recognises him once he changes back into the prince. All in all i thought it was a lovely, heart-warming film and i would definitely recommend seeing it for yourself."
"abigail-prohaska","7","0","3","21 March 2017"," Comparison with another version
","My critique will take the form of praise for another version of the tale, the German TV version of 2012 by Marc-Andreas Borchert, listed in IMDb and for which I wrote this review, as I say as a kind of cleansing reaction to the live-action version of the great cartoon of 1991: I wrote a review a few years ago about this TV film - asking Anglophone viewers not to be put off by the German, since they would be missing one of the most magical and moving versions of the tale. After seeing the bloated new version by Disney I had to go back to it as a kind of cleansing process. There are also some coincidences in the handling of the story that make me think the US team must have been inspired by this German version, some of the more poetic details – not in the latest and to the 1991 cartoon version – in the Disney seem based on ideas in Marc-Andreas Borchert's wonderful film. The main theme of transformation through love is enacted with utter credibility and convincing emotion, so there is great suspense that beast may not survive after all, making it a thriller as well as a dramatic love story. It plays in glorious Alpine scenery in castles both ruined and splendid, the music by Stephan Maria Schneider very moving, the actors ideal, a complex charismatic Beast and beautifully down-to-earth beauty, elements of humour; I cannot praise it enough and beg all to see it as an antidote to Hollywood megalomania (by which I do not mean the brilliant 1991 cartoon version!)."

","(RATING: ☆☆☆½ out of 5 ) <br/><br/>GRADE: B- <br/><br/>THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.<br/><br/>IN BRIEF: A second-hand knock-off that rarely touches the original's beauty but still entertains.<br/><br/>JIM'S REVIEW: The Hollywood Remake. A strange breed of movie it is. It is not a sequel adding more to an already told tale. It's more like a parasite leeching onto someone else's ideas and crediting themselves with all of the glory. Those who loved the original will look upon this new attempt with disdain, those who disliked the predecessor will question the filmmaker's motives. Is it pure folly or a creative need to improve upon the mistakes of others? Most recent remakes seem to be financial quests for more $$$, cashing in on the known product and its glowing reputation. Whatever the reason, all are hoping the film will be rediscovered by a new audience and make a profitable return.<br/><br/>Which brings us to the latest entry, Disney's Beauty and the Beast (2017). Now the studio has pulled from its vaults one of the most honored movies of all times, a near-perfect masterwork and the only animated film ever to be nominated for a Best Picture Oscar. (Perhaps we should drop to our knees and give thanks that they do not own the rights to Citizen Kane, Raging Bull, Some Like It Hot, or many other film classics.) <br/><br/>Beauty and the Beast (1991) has such a high pedigree and creates a daunting challenge to covert into a live action remake, even with all of the CGI state-of-the-art technology and artisans on board for this project.<br/><br/>Which leaves us to wonder: Can one ever perfect the already perfect...Is there room for improvement upon such a skillful work of art? Director Bill Condon was at the helm of this project and the answer to his end result is decidedly a mixed blessing.<br/><br/>Let me begin by saying that is much to admire in this re-imagining. Yet for every step forward, the film awkwardly takes two steps back: the nice mix of live action and CGI is more than serviceable yet hardly magical, the ensemble is well cast with some notable exceptions, production values are generally strong although proportions of the re-animated animated objects are inconsistent and vary in size from one scene to the next, and the glorious score by the talented team of Alan Menken and the late Howard Ashman remains relatively intact, with some additional new tunes added which do little to impress. (Except for one standard Broadway 11 o'clock number, Evermore, the additional tunes with lyrics by Tim Rice, are lackluster.)<br/><br/>Also, on the minus side: Backstories have been written for some of the characters, but they serve more as filler and do little to advance the plot. The screenplay by Stephen Chbosky and Evan Spilotopoulos has the basic plot handled successfully, but too many sub-plots muck up the works. The dialog has an overabundance of anachronisms than become almost as jarring in their dated pop culture references as Josh Gad's odd interpretation in the role of a minor sidekick character, La Fou, which becomes a major misstep in such a sweet story. The actor chooses to perpetuate the gay effeminate stereotype in his overt ""nance"" mannerisms that is humorless and borderline offensive. He almost ruins the film as he takes this fairy tale far too literally and figuratively, as does Bill Condon's direction. <br/><br/>His direction seems haphazard and in need of restraint. Mr. Condon often goes for the obvious slapstick and crass moments rather than enhancing the subtle charm and class of this classic love story. No more is this apparent than in his treatment of the film's big production number, Be Our Guest. (In the original animated version, the film is aglow with vibrant colors and stunning hand-drawn details that make for a delightful movie-going experience. Here, the moment is excessive, becoming a dizzying whirl of garish shapes and hyper-active movement that blurs the details of its imagery. Other musical sequences lack proper staging with scenes that overwhelm the proceedings. However, Mr. Condon does get the essential title number right in both setting a romantic mood and filling the screen with sumptuous detailing.<br/><br/>Some of the actors are spot-on, while other are just spotty. Emma Watson as Belle, is fine in her acting, but her singing is wispy and thin. (Paging Marni Nixon!) Ms. Watson does share a lovely chemistry with Dan Steven's Beast and the actor is very convincing in his angst under layers of make-up and special effects. Kevin Kline as Belle's father is a treat as is Luke Evans, playing a leaner and meaner Gaston. He captures the menace and vanity of this perfect foil. More voice-overs than real supporting turns are provided by Emma Thompson, Ewan McGregor, and Ian McKellen, while Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Stanley Lucci, and Audra McDonald try to bring some degree of interest into their fussy characterizations. And let's not even discuss the mincing of the aforementioned Mr. Gads any further...awful.<br/><br/>That said, Beauty and the Beast (2017) still entertains and is a lovely diversion in its tale of unconditional love. The celebrated music score is a lovely homage to the Broadway musicals of yore and its romantic story still enchants. I suppose, if one has never seen the superior 1991 film, I'm sure that what is on screen is all the more captivating.<br/><br/>Russia said, ""Nyet"" to this remake due to censorship issues with homophobia. I said, ""Meh"" to this remake due to purely aesthetic reasons. This film, while no beast, is certainly no beauty either. Rent, or better yet, buy the original animated version and bask in its rare beauty. Sometimes tales as old as time really are...to say the least."
"hammondholt-19230","7","0","4","20 March 2017"," How did they NOT make this the best film ever?
","Loved the animated version; in fact, would be in my top 25. Loved the stage version.<br/><br/>But then this live-action film happened. Disappointing. Cloogy. Forced emotion in parts. I'm supposed to accept the love blossoming between these two... and I did in the animated version; couldn't in this one... but to be honest, it choked me up anyway (though the tears started even prior to the moments, so I'm thinking I was working from the remembered story.)<br/><br/>But perhaps the most damaging... besides the forced plot points and emotion, was the horrific computer graphics on the Beast. With all the great graphics in other films, why did they settle for this?<br/><br/>Agree with others, should have been another director, perhaps other screenwriters (or just lift the animated version verbatim). It's not a waste of time... so I give it a 7. But watch the animated version if you have a choice. I'll need to do just that to get back my fondness for the story."

Twilight director Bill Condon promises to bring a lavish sense of magic to this all-star remake of the celebrated 1991 animation. Anchored by Watson and Stevens, the movie also features Welsh actor Luke Evans (Fast & Furious 6, Dracula Untold) as Gaston, Scottish actor Ewan McGregor (Shallow Grave, Trainspotting films) as Lumière which is the French for light, English actor Ian McKellen (X-Men films, The Lord Of The Rings films) as Cogsworth, English actress Emma Thompson (Nanny McPhee films, Men In Black 3 and the sister of English actress Sophie Thompson who played the evil Stella in the UK TV Series EastEnders from 2006 - 2077) as Mrs Potts, American actor Josh Gad (The Wedding Ringer, Pixels) as LeFou, English actress Hattie Morahan (Mr. Holmes, Alice Through The Looking Glass) as Agathe / Enchantress, English actress Haydn Gwynne (UK Comedy TV Series The Windsors, Hunky Dory) as Cothilde, English actor Gerard Horan (Cinderella 2015, My Week With Marilyn) as Jean the Potter, English actor Ray Fearon (UK TV Series Coronation Street, The Hooligan Factory) as Père Robert with Père being the French for dad or father, Nathan Mack as Chip, German actress Audra McDonald (Ricki And The Flash, Rampart) as Madame Garderobe with Madame being the French for Mrs, American actor Stanley Tucci (The Hunger Games films, Captain America: The First Avenger) as Maestro Cadenza, English actress Gugu Mbatha-Raw (Concussion, Free State Of Jones) as Plumette, English actor Clive Rowe (Manderlay, Shoot The Messenger) as Cuisinier, Thomas Padden (UK TV Series The Crown) as Chapeau, Gizmo as Froufrou, D.J.

So I will give Beauty And The Beast an overall rating of 3 out of 5 stars and I will say Beauty And The Beast is worth seeing if you like other Disney films like the live version of Cinderella from 2015, Maleficent, Cinderella the animated Disney version from 1951, Beauty And The Beast the animated Disney version from 1991, Sleeping Beauty, Into The Woods amongst others. So if you get the chance to see Beauty And The Beast in the cinema then you should go and see it sooner than later but in my opinion the new version of Beauty And The Beast is not as good as the original Beauty And The Beast the Disney animated version from 1991 which is good but please still go and see the new live version of the film and see if you like it or not and you will like it if you go to see it in the cinema."
"jgeorge4","7","0","5","19 March 2017"," Pretty Tough to Assign a Grade
","Let's stipulate to the fact that the animated version of Beauty and the Beast (and subsequent live musical productions)are absolute masterpieces. Beauty and the Beast may just be the greatest musical of all time.<br/><br/>So, let's also stipulate to the fact that the 2017 movie production is also pretty good. You can't take an established masterpiece, apply a Disney-sized budget and an all-star cast, and come out with a bad movie. The question is, did they come away with a great movie? Mmm...not really.<br/><br/>Is there anything about this extravagant production that improved upon the animated version? Well, there's new songs that are...um...pretty weak. There's the new version of LeFou, and he's umm...umm...there's the reimagined Maurice who is terribly miscast, drab, and lifeless. There's the new, not-especially-appealing, time-travel Paris schtick. And umm...did we mention LeFou loves Gaston? Amazing, huh?<br/><br/>So there you have it. It's live-action Beauty and the Beast on the big screen. It frequently looks wonderful, it's got the great songs that you love, Lumiere is terrific, but a great movie? <br/><br/>There must be more than this provincial life."

"caroline-skatten","7","0","8","18 March 2017"," Takes your right back to your childhood, but...
","This movie was absolutely beautiful made! The songs and the costumes were stunning and sent you right back to your childhood. In all honestly, the only thing there drew the movie back was the casting of the prince. When he transformed into a human again the whole theater burst out laughing including the person I came with. Because well you expect a handsome kind faced prince, but that was left with an empty feeling of ""eh?"". Not that the actor was extremely ugly, but he had a very normal appearance, that he was a random guy from the grocery store, just the everyday guy. Which isn't bad ofc, just very unexpected. I loved how Disney incorporated homosexual aspects in this movie with LeFou and another male. Kudos to Disney for doing that, it was very enjoyable also the fact that there are equal whites and blacks in the movie, was great to see and couldn't help smiling when I saw it :)<br/><br/>But definitely go see it anyways, just be prepared that you won't be wowed by the prince, apart from that this movie takes you right back to your childhood and is worth going seeing."
"bozieforsochi","8","0","8","17 March 2017"," Really fun and extremely charming!
","Going into this movie, I had low expectations. I'd seen poor reviews, and I also kind of hate the idea of remaking animated films for no reason other than to make them live action, as if that's supposed to make them better some how. This movie pleasantly surprised me!<br/><br/>Beauty and the Beast is a fun, charming movie, that is a blast in many ways. The film very easy on the eyes! Every shot is colourful and beautifully crafted. The acting is also excellent. Dan Stevens is excellent. You can see him if you look closely at The Beast, but not so clearly that it pulls you out of the film. His performance is suitably over the top in anger, but also very charming. Emma Watson was fine, but to be honest, she was basically just playing Hermione, and I didn't get much of a character from her. She likes books, and she's feisty. That's basically all I got. For me, the one saving grace for her character, is you can see how much fun Emma Watson is having. I've heard interviews in which she's expressed how much she's always loved Belle as a character, and it shows.<br/><br/>The stand out for me was Lumieré, voiced by Ewan McGregor. He was hilarious, and over the top, and always fun! He lit up the screen (no pun intended) every time he showed up!<br/><br/>The only real gripes I have with the film are some questionable CGI with the Wolves and with a couple of The Beast's scenes, and some pacing issues. The film flows really well, to such an extent that in some scenes, the camera will dolly away from the character it's focusing on, and will pan across the countryside, and track to another, far away, with out cutting. This works really well, but a couple times, the film will just fade to black, and it's quite jarring. It happens like 3 or 4 times, but it's really noticeable, and took me out of the experience. Also, they added some stuff to the story that I don't want to spoil, but I don't think it worked on any level, story wise, or logically.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a fun movie! I would recommend it to any fan of the original, but those who didn't like the animated classic, or who hate musicals might be better off staying away!<br/><br/>84/100"
"stevendbeard","7","0","7","17 March 2017"," If You Liked The Original....
","I saw ""Beauty and the Beast"", starring Emma Watson-My Week With Marilyn, the Harry Potter movies; Dan Stevens-Legion_tv, Downton Abbey_tv; Luke Evans-The Girl on the Train, Fast & Furious 6; Josh Gad-Pixels, Love & Other Drugs and Kevin Kline-Ricki and the Flash.<br/><br/>This is a live-action remake of the classic 1991 Disney film, which was in turn, based on a French fairy tale. If you have fond memories of that 1991 story then you should enjoy this version. It is a musical so it contains new versions of those loved songs from the original, plus it has a few new songs, too. The story is pretty much the same-don't judge a book by it's cover-but it is also filled out more. For instance, in the original, the origin of the Beast is told in narration at the beginning of the movie, but here, it is actually shown. Emma plays Belle, Kevin is her father Maurice, Dan is the Beast, Luke is Gaston and Josh is his faithful sidekick LeFou. Oh, I should mention that before the movie was even released, there was all kinds of talk about there being a gay character in the movie and people being upset about it-I even heard some people were going to boycott the movie. It's all ridiculous. The character in question is Josh/LeFou and things are only hinted at that he likes Luke/Gaston. Nothing ever happens between the two in any sort of gay fashion so you can relax. These rumors are usually started by people that haven't even seen the movie in the first place-which irritates me to no end. Anyway, like I said earlier, if you liked the original, then you will probably like this one, too. It's rated ""PG"" for action violence, peril and frightening images and has a running time of 2 hours & 9 minutes. I enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD."
