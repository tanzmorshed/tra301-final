"ken558","5","62","98","25 June 2015"," Vast Potential Fun, But Frustratingly Underplayed
","What an enviable list of voice-over stars. <br/><br/>What fun characters mouthing multi-language pseudo-meaninged gibberish (as opposed to just gibberish). <br/><br/>What a great start with a series of interesting minion history snippets (all of them already in the trailer - yes, those are the best bits and nothing else in the rest of the movie comes close).<br/><br/>What frustration when the gear just gets stuck - and the whole thing numbingly grinds into predictable land with uninteresting plot, an array of boring characters  blah blah  and ends up just another multimillion gibberish animation.<br/><br/>After the first 10 mins, Minions is plagued by too many unnecessary pointless characters, plain villains, inconsequential dialogue and actions  and the boredom (and depression) that the Minions experience on screen is unfortunately also paralleled at the same time by the audience and never really lifted up after that.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, Allison Janney's character and voice was the most distinctive, but it was only a minor role. Sandra Bullock's villain Scarlett Overkill is way underdone, and the character visualization lacks any wickedly engaging factor, just boringly unlikeable. Jon Hamm's character adds nothing at all to the flimsy plot and his voice is too generic to matter as to who is doing it. All the other stars had inconsequential and indistinctive who-cares voice-overs.<br/><br/>The whole thing is so bland that the leery voice of Young Gru (Steve Carrell) right at movie's end was such a welcomed relief - at last (and alas it was the end) a little promise of inventive fun  but way too late.<br/><br/>Watch it, but don't expect too much and you'd probably be mildly entertained."

","I don't usually write reviews but this was such a disappointment that I felt I had to put something. Most of the good jokes were shown in the trailers, so if you've seen the trailer then it's probably not worth the money. There were 3 of us watched this and although we all loved the despicable movies none of us enjoyed this. My son (11) said it felt like it was 2 hours long it was so boring. I can't really explain why it came across as so poor - but it just seemed really lazy and without Gru to play against the Minnions were just to simple. It was slapstick with no soul. The music although quite good didn't really seem to fit the film - just seemed to be tacked on at bit were they felt they should have a soundtrack and a famous song. Buy yourself a copy of despicable me and watch it again and again. Much better value for money! This just felt rushed, with loads of stock jokes, maybe hoping enough of them would hit the mark - they didn't."
"davidmsneddon","1","60","111","16 July 2015"," Bloody awful.
","My seven year old was excited to see it. I expected it to be pish. But it was worse than I imagined. I fell asleep a few times but the annoying yelling pretend dialogue woke me up. I couldn't even get a nap out of my wasted afternoon. At least I didn't have to worry about my kid laughing too loudly and disturbing anyone else's sleep. He got bored too. Just utter crap. They clearly spent a lot on the music. The Beatles, the kinks, and van Halens eruption as a guitar solo at the merciful end to this travesty of a film. If only they had spent the money on a scriptwriter rather than the over- caffeinated sixth graders they got hopped up on juice boxes before handing them some paper to defecate on and call that a script. The humor in the film was non existent. I expected lots of broad fart jokes and low brow stupidity aimed at chimps, five year olds, and the same kind of morons who made Kevin James a star. What I got was obvious pop culture references not as punchlines or set up for jokes. Just there. As if the existence of a reference to something recognizable was in and of itself funny. Perhaps it served as a confidence booster for the gump-like, slack jawed, troglodytes that were the target audience. They could all feel jolly clever after recognizing such obscure references as the Beatles. Well done. If I had a time machine and only choose to change one thing in the pas, forget hitter, I would go back to stop whoever green lit this cinematic excretion."

","with all the sponsorship of all kinds of commercial products and exhibitions and promotions this rubbish has become a must-see and nobody dares to say a bad word against it because you are not sure people dare to agree with you while in fact almost everybody falls asleep in the theater. you could only keep quiet during and after seeing the movie. the story is not suitable for children. the plot is so weak it can hardly called a comedy. the characters are a bunch of scrambles. a total disappointment. the only thing i could do is to sigh. in this generation we are living in a pool of propaganda. popularity rules."
"captainmike-michael","7","47","85","20 June 2015"," Not as Funny as Despicable Me
","The popularity and the huge profits of Despicable Me franchise has driven the eagerness of Illumination Entertainment to produce a minions spin-off solely to entertain the fans. Caught in variations of the same scenarios, the decision to put more focus on the three minions - Kevin, Stuart and Bob might remind audiences about Alvin and the Chipmunks or the three daughters of Gru. While the animation does remain the fun, hilarious and ridiculous behaviors of the characters, the theme of the scores and the nonsensical language of the minions, it does not have a strong villain to support the three, also it lacks of character development, warm emotional engagement and moral values. The cuteness of the minions is the main element for entertainment rather than the dialogue itself in which the jokes aren't as funny as Despicable Me's series. Nonetheless, it is still energetic, actions packed, visually stunning and colorful for family audiences even its creative mistake drags its overall quality, proving that these banana lovers are far more effective and surprising to be supporting characters just as in the main franchise."
"suzj-36742","10","72","140","1 July 2015"," Good family movie - Minions
","I avoided watching Despicable Me for a long time. I just didn't like the look of it. But as it turned out, I loved the film when I was eventually coerced into seeing it by one of my nephews. It was thanks to him that I also liked the second movie. As for the third movie, I don't know why some IMDb users are complaining that this movie is more suitable for 'kids and families'. It seems odd to expect anything more from The Minions when that is the main target audience! I watched this film with my own family and since this was the first time I took my toddler to the cinema, it makes it extra special. I enjoyed the movie, laughed out at several points and liked it even more to see how much my daughter loved it. We all had a good time and there were no complaints at all. This one, like Despicable Me 1 and 2, was great entertainment, lots of villainy and slapstick humour. It is the best kids animation I've seen in a long time. A lot of fun."
"RNMorton","4","28","50","10 July 2015"," Why was this movie made?
","I'm sitting in the nearly vacant theater on premiere night and thinking somewhere there must be a struggling movie maker pondering how Hollywood could pump millions into this pedestrian cartoon babble and not into his or her creation? If you feel like you have to see this movie I have four suggestions: 1) pop in any CD of Back to the Barnyard and watch 3 episodes, 2) pop in any Penguins of Madagascar CD or its variants, 3) watch the Croods, but with the sound off, or 4) bang your head against the wall with medium impact for 1 1/2 hours. The best thing about this movie was the short running time, even with the pressure these days to fill and expand movie lengths this was so spare to begin with that they had no place else to go. One other alternative is to watch the trailer 100 times. My son just barely made it through, he gave it a 6 1/2 on the way out. Most of the (unintelligible) lines are in Minion gibberish, maybe this was a good thing? I mean it when I say pass 'em by."
"coreyjdenford","9","79","158","26 June 2015"," One in a Minion
","This is my review of the lighthearted fun for all the family Minions (spoiler free). This film is set way before the time when the Minions meet Gru (Steve Carrell from Despicable me 1 &2). With a comedic edge the film will probably keep you laughing for ages. There were moments when I was just crying with laughter. <br/><br/>The Minions (Piere Coffin, voice) are basically on a quest to find the perfect boss/master the minions in their silly yet hysterical ways try their hardest to keep a master for just longer than a week but it goes horribly wrong for them. The three main Minions (on the poster) are Kevin, Bob and Stuart set off on a journey to find their new master in 1968 (42 years BG, Before Gru) Kevin is the smartest Minion, Stuart is the most ambitious and finally Bob is the cutest and plus the one that is the most clumsy. <br/><br/>Minions is a silly yet hilarious prequel to Despicable Me which as you all know is the story of Gru and the Minions. There are three reasons on why I that this film is a must see. <br/><br/>1. Original plot and storyline: This film has an original which basically starts off with the Minions evolution and basically explains more about how the Minions came along in their own funny ways as told by narrator Geoffrey Rush.<br/><br/>2. Dialogue: The dialogue is hilarious because it starts off with the Minion language but it isn't off putting it's funny and sometimes witty but there is human dialogue as well. Voices by Sandra Bullock, Steve Coogan, Michael Keaton etc. <br/><br/>3. The Minion: The Minions are the main part of the story (obviously) but the Minions are witty and well probably the most hilarious characters in any animation.<br/><br/>Overall this film was really enjoyable and really put a massive smile on my face and it filled the entire cinema with laughter. This is fun for all the family a must see hilarious animation that will put a smile on your face and will keep you laughing from start to finish. This film was especially good in 3D. 9/10 One in a Minion."
"standlucian","1","19","32","8 January 2016"," This was so bad
","Words fail both me and my girlfriend in describing this awful piece of digested food. This movie is bad even by kid standards and, frankly, I don't think they could've managed to ruin the Minions any better. Half the dialog in this movie is in Minionese, of which nothing can be understood. The jokes are so bad, all they managed was get a single l.o.l. out of us. Nope, not a laugh, a l.o.l. The ""villainesse"" is boring, overdone and, frankly, unforgettable for how bad she is. Even the Minions are boring (how they accomplished that is beyond me). To say nothing of the way they portrayed the Queen of England and England itself. I'm Romanian and it still made me angry! If you want to watch this, just don't. Spare yourself the time, boredom and probably money and SEE SOMETHING ELSE."
"billa48","1","23","40","18 July 2015"," What a garbage movie
","I just saw this movie with my 5 year old, even he was unimpressed. Despicable me 2 had him do the bee do thing for days. He's already forgotten about this one and we're watching cartoons now. Such a large marketing campaign, such fan fare, such boat loads of horse, over this BS. Nothing but silly noises and stupid story line. Even the older kids in the theater were like what. Movie got repetitive and boring very quickly. You have such an excellent idea and product here, why waste it like this. The minions are everywhere, ice cream, cereal box, underpants, happy meal, not a thing without them, and they are lovely and adorable characters. The kids will love them if you can please have a story line instead of them running around making noises. Please do a better job with Despicable 3."
"soodratik","6","63","124","11 July 2015"," Hilarious!
","Having read bad reviews I went with low expectations. But as the movie started my laughter overshadowed my expectations. <br/><br/>Kevin, Stuart and Bob go on a journey to find a super villain to be their tribe's boss.<br/><br/>Yes, the story was predictable and it may not have been as good as Despicable me 1 and 2 but to be honest it really didn't matter. It was amazingly funny and there was not a single moment in which I got bored. Also the jokes were not at all kiddish and would make a person of any age laugh. 3D was also pretty good. <br/><br/>So i would recommend you to leave the serious part of your brain at your house and watch this hilarious and light hearted movie of the adorable minions.<br/><br/>P.S If you haven't watched the trailer, don't.You will enjoy the movie much more."
"punishable-by-death","8","51","101","4 July 2015"," A different perspective for you folk
","I live under a rather large rock. I don't have TV reception and I am horrible with pop culture. I just follow movies, obsessively, and that has only been for the last two years. So in my world, until not long ago I had no idea what the Minions were. I now feel a little foolish, as for once my friends answer 'yes' when I mention the last film I saw. This is not the normal reaction I get. Apparently this movie is a massive deal. But none of this bothers me. Is this a good film to become a child again for 90 minutes while giggling yourself stupid? Well... A thousand times yes!! I even find the very purpose of their existence to be a funny, somewhat dark joke. They live to serve tyrants. If these guys were people, they'd have served in the S-freakin-S. Which the movie conveniently ignores when going through the Minions' history, good decision. But hey, they are little, adorable yellow things so its hard to ever picture them in a bad way. They just want to help! Even if it is the SS! This film is filled with slapstick comedy, which is great for all ages, while there are some great jokes early on for older viewers: my favourite, a giant poster saying ""A MAN YOU CAN TRUST"", and under those letters is a giant face of Nixon. Ha!! There is a lot packed in here, but if it has a flaw, and it does, it is the second half. Sandra Bullock sounds like she phoned in her effort - literally - and the humour simply wasn't as rife as it was during the first half.<br/><br/>The best thing about Minions is it is achingly funny, the second half still great, but not compared to the first, which is simply a riot. I love the fact that their language can be gibberish, but we can follow what they are saying most of the time. I find it to be an amazing achievement honestly, especially given it is animated. But the truly great thing about this movie is it is 90 minutes of being a child again. Personally this is kind of great for me, as I have zero memories from before I was thirteen. So to watch a movie that truly makes me feel like a child, in the best possible sense, is a damn good experience.<br/><br/><ul><li>jordy www.epilepticmoondancer.net</li></ul>"
"shinraturk888","9","48","95","8 July 2015"," Super Cute.
","Minions isn't as great a story as Despicable Me, but it's definitely a lot of fun. It's just a silly little story, giving some background to the little corn pops.<br/><br/>I really had a good time watching it. There's lots of goofy action, and thank god, it wasn't full of stupid bathroom humour. It was actually pretty funny. The kids will like it.<br/><br/>My favourite part of the movie was the soundtrack. The movie takes place in the 60s, so the songs comes from that era. It's going to introduce so many kids to a lot of good music, and you can never go wrong with that, especially nowadays."
"tommyshoe","5","41","81","26 June 2015"," Really quite disappointing
","I was really looking forward to this after really enjoying Despicable Me and Despicable Me II.<br/><br/>If this had been a standalone film rather than a spin off i'd say it would warrant 7 out of 10 but following on from the minions being major highlights in both Despicable me movies this was really disappointing.<br/><br/>Just not enough of the silly shenanigans from the minions that you'd expect and a lot of quite pointless and quite frankly boring dialogue in parts.<br/><br/>I'm taking my nephews to go see this soon and I really doubt it'll hold there attention - that's how boring it is.....<br/><br/>Disappointed."
"iRoswell","9","44","88","11 July 2015"," A treat for the whole family!
","My wife and I went to see this, we loved both Despicable Me's, and had high hopes for the movie. Thankfully, while it wasn't as good as either Despicable Me's, it was a good movie. It is very kid oriented, duh, so don't go thinking you're going to get an in-depth plot line. The minions are corny and their antics are as slapstick as they are in Despicable Me. While you would think that it would be difficult to relate to, due to them not speaking English, it's not a problem. They did a great job at making everything understandable through context, even for a small child. The biggest issue I had was in the form of Scarlet Overkill. I didn't care for the angle they chose to go with her. I'll leave it at that so I don't include any spoilers. If you have small children, they will love every minute of this movie. Minions is simple, fun, and safe for anyone!!!"
"ofpsmith","9","37","73","12 July 2015"," An good and interesting prequel.
","Apparently the minions in Despicable Me weren't created by Gru. They're a group of being that date from prehistoric times to serve the most evil people imaginable. From the Tyrannosaurus Rex to Napoleon Bonaparte. But they find they always inadvertently kill their masters. They feel depression and isolate themselves from the rest of the world. Until one day in 1968 Kevin (Pierre Coffin) goes to the world again with two other minions Stuart (Coffin) and Bob (Coffin) to find a master. They get to New York, New York where they hear about Scarlet Overkill (how subtle) (Sandra Bullock) who is aiming to be the world's first female super villain. What follows is a big series of jokes and quite the story line that makes this a great movie. To those reading this review look at your schedule and make time to bring your family to this film tonight. You won't regret it. It has fun characters, comedy, and all the minions that made the last two films so great."
"shootingstarforgiven","10","48","98","14 July 2015"," Simply perfect
","This is not a complicated film. There is no sophisticated humour. Most of it is toddler level. <br/><br/>The plot is summarized on the trailers. The minions are a tribe of yellow round things that want to assist villains in their villainy. They have been doing this since the dawn of time. Historically they have run in to difficulties in their quest to identify the perfect bad guy to serve. After repeated failures they withdrew to the arctic and attempted to entertain themselves, putting the concerns of other life forms to the side.<br/><br/>The protagonists, Bob, Stuart and Kevin are three minions that decided to brave the unknown and seek out a new leader. They depart and arrive in New York, in 1968. Essentially, we then follow their adventures throughout the film. <br/><br/>Wackiness ensues. The laws of physics are suspended. Gibberish is spoken to wondrous effect.<br/><br/>You don't have to be 2 years old to love this film. I personally love it, and I'm an adult without children. I don't even really like children, but if I had a child I imagine they would like this film. The Minions have this magical quality that forces the rational mind to check out, like anything adorable. They're mischievous, clumsy, and sweet - they want to do good, and this makes them endearing. <br/><br/>Some have complained that this movie lacks substance. I would respond that you don't need substance with a movie like this. It is gold, yellow gold.<br/><br/>But, I am sorry for all the mass marketing."
"yengahan-254-257374","9","39","78","11 July 2015"," Not Sandra Bullock's best
","Really funny movie. Lots of little quirky links to other movies, well-known music, famous people. You'd have to see it a few times to catch them all. I was somewhat disappointed at how the director chose to use Sandra Bullock's voice. I didn't find the character of Scarlett Overkill frightening enough, and as a result Sandra Bullock's voice was somewhat plain, there wasn't much sweetness versus angryness/threat in the voice, like you find with other movie villains. Scarlet Overkill's plans for the crown were crazy, but that didn't really come out. Nevertheless, I think I'll need to go again sometime. There is so much funniness in this movie."
"cheerio-lauren","10","50","103","27 June 2015"," Best film I've seen all year (and the perfect film for my mother's 49th Birthday)!
","I loved both of the Despicable Me films, and had looked forward to the Minions Movie for months. It certainly did not disappoint! Bob totally steals it for being adorable and funny, and the ending is perfect! My mum doesn't normally enjoy comedy, but the Minions sent both of us and my brother into hysterics that were louder than the collective laughter of the children in the theatre! There are a few jokes in it I don't expect children will understand too well and a couple of risqué moments that are obviously intended for older viewers, but I do believe that it engages viewers of all ages well and tells a lovely story with plenty of hijinks to entertain everyone! Illuminations are well on track to surpass the likes of Disney with their animation, and I would not be surprised if this is considered a permanent fixture of children's classic films for generations to come."
"satishchandrap","10","53","110","10 July 2015"," Best Movie With lot of Minions
","Firstly,Thank to Pierre Coffin to design the Minions, the best animated characters we ever had.

The Character of Sandra bullock is pretty good and the dialogs in the movie are written well.The story was framed clearly and the voice of all 899 minions given by the Pierre coffin is awesome.The other crew of the movie also acted well.Especially the three major roles of the movie Kevin,Stuart,Bob are the strongest traits for the movie.

"reggie-at-random","10","38","76","12 July 2015"," Bloody BRILLIANT!
","Perhaps I am not as jaded as so many reviewers or even just viewers are...not yawning at the fantastic animation in Minions, the brilliant use of allusions and satire side by side with slapstick and so many side bits. I really have to believe that those who didn't like this movie simply didn't have the knowledge or the media/social historical savvy to GET all the stuff crammed into this wonderfully delightful film. It's possible that the 50+ crowd would embrace this film faster and more readily than the 30-40 something crowd who actually have little ones who would just love the basic silliness. I wanted to stop action constantly...hey, wait, did I see Brezhnev AND Nixon in those front rows at the villancon!? I simply will have to get my own copy and enjoy the details at home. Loved that Queenie was having a jolly pub crawl on leave as it were. The Corgy has a short tail by the way chaps, and our English sterling wasn't decimalised until 1970 but why quibble over little things like that? So grandparents? Grab a kid and see this! You won't regret it!"
"hjpog","7","13","22","20 December 2015"," Minions good idea to do a movie.
","First, as I mentioned in the title of the minions movie definitely had to be done. Because it is one of the most important elements bearing the serial Despicable Me minions. Despicable Me minions in the series of the effect of being so famous too big. This film has been put very clever jokes. And Despicable Me keeps it also replaces the series has been really fun. England have made a nice joke. But I think that members of IMDb get a little serious. Because it shows voting. Overall I think this is an animated film would not hurt a little joke. Here I saw a lot of flying animation and animation scores this could be a bit better. But unfortunately IMDb's not tolerate this kind of thing. Despicable Me series of lovers almost think I will get the same pleasure. In addition, this film is graced with great rock musics director for Kyle Balda and Pierre Coffin thanks."
"randaashraf-70075","9","25","48","10 July 2015"," Minions Movie Magic
","This movie takes the cake because it made $6.2 million this past preview on Thursday before the opening weekend, which makes this the best animated hit of all time. <br/><br/>Meet Stuart, Kevin and Bob indeed. The minions are majestic companions. So they deserve their own spin off movie and finally got one. This movie is a prequel, which is something cool. The Minions high energy and enthusiasm portray their naiveté and purity. Their silliness and clumsiness comes with ease and how they copy people and each other as if it's contagious. <br/><br/>To put a movie like this again and again in different ways must be difficult through directing and editing as well as the acting and character design. The soundtrack is fitting in with the times. Truly applaud the cast and crew.<br/><br/>The Minions are movie magic that as expected had us glued to our seats. The animation is top notch as always. For it to be in 3-D makes it all the more enjoyable. This movie has non-stop action and laughter for all. The minions are immortal henchmen creatures that try their best to be handy and helpful. That will try their best to lead champions from the Ancient Egyptians to Napoleon<br/><br/>The minions have many mannerisms that make them accessible to kids. For example, their language is so fun for kids to hear and their fascination with bananas are hilarious. Very well planned, organized and executed. <br/><br/>It is very educational in that it teaches never to give up regardless of the number of mistakes because giving up is depressing on the long run. The Minions learned this lesson the hard way. Then the importance of family is another lesson. For instance, the villain family as well as the Minion family - all focus on helping the family first. Helping those in need but with a bias is not an intended lesson but funny to watch. <br/><br/>Overall brilliant the minions can carry a movie. Yet a sequel on their own is not needed. A show without Gru or other funny character that are not villains is perhaps a better addition."
"pcobipad","8","27","53","2 July 2015"," A Lighthearted and Unexpectedly Great Movie.
","I loved the Despicable Me movies, and while I was highly anticipating this movie, I did have some doubts. But after seeing it twice, I can say that this is a great spin-off to a fantastic franchise.<br/><br/>Firstly, the animation looks gorgeous; each character is nicely detailed and coloured and the backgrounds look astonishing in their own ways. In addition, the character models look very unique and distinguishable, with no one model looking similar to another. But the main part that makes this movie great is it's clever humour and witty dialouge. The jokes are funny without being stupid or predictable and the dialouge definitely feels like it was written in the late 1960's, which is when the movie is set. The movie is also very historically accurate. When the Minions that where left in Antarctica make it to Sydney, the Opera House is still under construction. The Opera House wasn't complete until 1973, making the movie accurate and well researched.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the movie wasn't perfect. One of the biggest problems with this movie was the main villain Scarlet Overkill. Now don't get me wrong, I thought the character and her motivations were fine, I just felt that her personality wasn't as exciting and playful as the trailers told us. While Sandra Bullock did a great job at voicing her, she occasionally sounded bored and uninterested. I wouldn't have actually minded if her husband, Herb, was the main villain, as he felt cool and energetic throughout the entire movie. Another thing I didn't like was how under-utilised the Nelson family was. They were funny and matched the tone of the movie perfectly, but their only purpose was to give Kevin, Stuart and Bob a ride to Villain- Con. What made it worse was that the father, Mr. Nelson, was voiced by Michael Keaton, one of the most talented people in this movie, and he felt completely wasted.<br/><br/>But overall, I thought that this was a great movie. Beautiful animation, clever humour, witty dialouge and historical accuracy all make it a blast to watch with your friends and family."

","Minions!!!<br/><br/>Three Stooges meet 60's music. Really simplistic plot (if any) that likely will put off adults. This is not Despicable Me, Wall-E or Incredibles, it is more of a classic cartoon - fun but pointless. Frenetic enough comic action for little ones. Enough rude & crude stuff for older kids. Great soundtrack of 60's music for grandparents (with a really disturbing but funny performance of ""Hair"".). There are many slow parts that I guess are directed at adults, and I was surprised my theater full of toddlers didn't get bored during those.<br/><br/>None of the families with kids stayed through the credits, missing out on the ""cast"" party set to The Beatles ""Revolution"" - loaded with (as the Muppets put it) cheap 3D gimmicks. Unlike Wall-E there was no visual action through the credits roll to keep anyone's attention, which is a shame because the post credit madness was well done fun.<br/><br/>I give it a B-. It's got a beat and you can dance to it."

","I saw Minions the day it came out and there are some things I I love about this film but at the same time I do have some issues with it.<br/><br/>Good points:<br/><br/>1. It was really good to see something focusing on the Minions. Audiences for a long time have wanted to see something revolving around them and when we got it, there was no disappointment.<br/><br/>2. Scarlet Overkill acts and sounds like a Bond movie villain but for a kids movie. Which as a fan of James Bond films, I loved very much.<br/><br/>3.The British stereotypes in this film are brilliant and just downright hilarious, and mind you this is coming from a British guy himself. It also felt like they were poking fun at the stereotypes as well.<br/><br/>Bad points:<br/><br/>1. The film takes about 20 minutes to get underway. I honestly thought I was going to hate this film at first but the moment the Minions get to Villain Con then things improve drastically.<br/><br/>2. It's obvious that quite a lot of the jokes in the movie are aimed at children. This annoyed me at some points but there were also jokes and not just funny but hilarious scenes in there for everyone to enjoy as well.<br/><br/>Final rating: 8/10"
"lesleyharris30","8","27","54","29 June 2015"," Lacks Heart, but All Ages should be Entertained,
","Minions is a great movie with a well developed storyline and a terrific voice cast. Despite people's love for these characters, it seemed like a big risk to give the minions their own solo movie, mainly for the fact that they can't speak, but it worked out very well and is probably one of the most impressive spin off movies to date, something Hiollywood have gotten right on very few occasions. The characters are very lovable and we genuinely care for and support them in their journey. It suffers from the same problem a lot of these animated spin offs have (Penguins of Madagascar, Puss in Boots, etc.), it dosen't have as much heart as the movies it is spun off from have, no scenes that warm us and make us feel sympathetic towards the characters to the same degree we do for Gru and his daughters, this is something I think should always be evident in animated films and it is a huge loss when it isn't. The voice cast is outstanding and certainly the highlight of the movie, Peter Coffin is obviously superb as every single minion, and there are also great performances from the likes of Sandra Bullock, Jon Hamm, Michael Keaton, Allison Janney and Geoffrey Rush, who all sounded like they really enjoyed delivering these characters dialogue and wern't just in it for the pay check. It's certainly not perfect, but Minions is definitely a very fun and enjoyable ride that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good family film. <br/><br/>After searching for someone to serve, the Minions become recruits for Scarlet Overkill, who hatches a plan to take over England, and eventually the world."

","2013's Despicable Me 2 has proved that people came back to this franchise for the striking popularity of the film's comic relief characters, the Minions. So the studio basically made a spin-off mainly for them, which makes more sense than having these characters stealing the predecessor's spotlight, thus leads to a result that can be good and mostly bad. It seems that the filmmakers don't have much of a decent idea for the original character for a while, so it's quite appropriate for them to stumble into these Minions while it lasts. Unfortunately, the film doesn't find a compelling storyline for these antics to fit right through. While the gags are funny enough, it suddenly gets exhausting after a while. In the end, there is just nothing remarkable about it.<br/><br/>The Minions happen to be long-living prehistoric creatures that exist to serve any formidable master, in spite of their often incompetence. It's a decent little origin story, even though we would rather assume them as an accidental science experiment. But this makes for a setup of putting them in desperation for having a boss after a number of failures of keeping them alive. Now that the actual plot enters the picture, the movie now takes place where supervillains are the ones who deserve them, with three of the Minions stumbling from one misadventure to another. The laughs are solid, though some can feel a little forced while some can be unexpectedly tasteless, but a joke works if the film actually finds an inspired humor within itself. But the main story itself doesn't find any remarkable substance or any cleverness, at all. It's just randomness after randomness, and it's sometimes losing its steam until the film finally finds another occasional great joke again after ten minutes or so.<br/><br/>The comedic action on screen is undeniably enjoyable. The bright, playful visuals have always been helpful in these Despicable Me movies. The movie centrally takes place in a new environment and time, while adequately captures the era and location, though also making unimaginative stereotyping to the British culture, but anyway. Some dark humor sneaks in, as well, it gets a little too outrageous, but I believe it's for the sake of establishing its world of villainy. The story eventually not gaining much of a center at all. These series of silly situations lead to the fate that we would all expect. Nothing more and nothing less. The voice acting is only impressive when it comes to the Minions, we all knew that already from the past installments. The rest of the cast are committed to go over-the-top as their characters are actually written.<br/><br/>In spite of extending the focus of these characters who are more popular than Gru, it's still not quite a satisfying experience. Maybe the Minions aren't meant to have a movie at all. It would have been a kid's TV show being played in the morning or something. Or the story would have given itself more effort in sticking these comedic moments with coherency. It's possible. Earlier this year, Aardman proved that physical comedy still works in this era of more verbal animated films and can be consistent in narrative. But the film seems too aimless to realize that. It's only pandering the audience until they are interested with Gru again for the third Despicable Me, only if that sequel could offer more than this."

","Before I proceed please note that I have not seen the Despicable Me movies. I merely took a chance with this one. Thankfully, I was pleasantly surprised to find it decently entertaining, despite its intended target audience and the fact that I've been around for at least 38 years.<br/><br/>IMDb reviewer elliemcnair and Co. have beautifully summarized the plot so I'll go straight to my 2 cents': the movie is entertaining in the sense that it has something for the young and the young at heart to enjoy, while having other things that more mature audiences can also appreciate. It was a treat to see references to British culture and pop culture such as James Bond, the Beatles, rock and roll, etc.. <br/><br/>The people who will best appreciate this movie, however, are the fans of the Despicable Me movies or folks who love the minions' silly antics. The latter idea was what caused the move to feel like hit-and-miss for me depending on the scene. Certain jokes and scenes were humorous to me while others felt a bit flat, as if the writers were trying a bit too hard to provide something funny just for the sake of having a joke.<br/><br/>Overall, however, it was easy for me to to empathize and identify with the title characters' search for a master to serve. Ultimately, that is what appeals to adults: the identification with a desire to find--even create--meaning and purpose in one's life. Yes, the movie is a comedy yet it is also a metaphor for life. It is nice to know that underneath the seemingly mindless slapstick humor is a deeper meaning that all of us can resonate with, regardless of age or station."
"nicolechan916","8","19","36","14 July 2015"," Great characters with amazing animation and a hilarious script.
","Perhaps I am a little biased in my opinion of this film, as I loved the two Despicable Me movies, plus the minions was a theme for my residence floor last year. So as you see, I have a personal affiliation with the minions. I really enjoyed this.<br/><br/>The story is simple but not boring or over-exaggerated. There are many little happenings throughout the film that add to the atmosphere and overall mood of the film. Choosing to focus on three minions (though I miss Dave) was a good call. The three different personalities – not to mention shape size – of these minions were so prominent and well established that instead of being 'minions' they were Kevin, Stuart and Bob. Kevin being the older brother, Stuart the rock star and Bob the most lovable.<br/><br/>The animation was great with good effects and colours that matched the theme of the film. However, I do have to disagree with the extreme body sizes of some characters. Most have too tall and skinny bodies; Walter Nelson (Michael Keaton) and Herb Overkill (Jon Hamm) both look like a human version of 'Daddy long legs'. I guess however, that this adds to the impossibility element of the film.<br/><br/>The voice acting was pretty awesome. I love Sandra Bullock, and she did great here, I almost couldn't recognize her voice in some places. She gave great energy to her character, as did Jon Hamm and Michael Keaton. I did not recognize Jennifer Saunders as The Queen, but it did sound familiar, and she was funny. But obviously the spotlight goes to Pierre Coffin and his marvellous gibberish minions talk. There is notably a lot of Spanish words and phrases in the minions speech in addition to many other languages that seem to just fit in randomly here and there. I was pleasantly shocked to hear Bob say 'Terima Kasih' which means thank you in Malay. Mad props to Coffin, to be able to voice the minions in a way that can be distinguishable between the three main characters.<br/><br/>Maybe the reason I like this so much is because there is less obvious talking and more inferencing of what the minions are talking about. Because even though we do not understand them in the literal sense, we can still infer as to what they are referring to.<br/><br/>This movie is more about having fun than anything else and I enjoyed it thoroughly.<br/><br/>Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com"

"ironhorse_iv","6","13","23","12 July 2015"," The movie wasn't despicable. The movie just mindless entertainment. Fun to watch.
","Ever since they first appeared in Universal Pictures/Illumination Entertainment 2010 film debut, Despicable Me. The lovable side characters, the minions have been fan favorites! There is something special to these diminutive, banana-loving, nonsense-spouting henchmen to the point that they somewhat overshadow the main characters. I have to believe that the minions became popular, due to three factors: their cartoony baby-like appearance, their toddler-like gibberish language, and last, their charming, silly, childlike humor. They're pretty much, the embodied all the good things about children. Adults love them. Children love them. Most people love them. It's really hard to hate them. So, it's no surprise that their role was expanding in 2013's hugely successful sequel, Despicable Me 2. Now, with Universal Pictures' latest release, the Minions have been push as the main characters in their own spin-off movie, due to their overall, likability. While, it's nice to see them, in their own standalone film, sadly the film lacks substance. The movie really doesn't have, much depth to its unimaginative plot. Directed by Kyle Balda & Pierre Coffin, the movie chronicles how the little yellow creatures have always been drawn to follow the biggest villains surrounding them. This time, they seek out renowned international villain Scarlett Overkill (voiced by Sandra Bullock) to be their boss. They win her trust and accompany her to England, where they must prove their loyalty by stealing the queen's crown jewels with the help of Scarlett's weapons-specialist husband, Herb (Jon Hamm). While the movie seems like a 1960s spy/heist film, from the trailers, the movie is barely that. Without spoiling the movie, too much, the movie plot moves very slowly. The first half, with the Minions, trying to reach Villain Con in Orlando was very pointless. The whole idea of them, finding it, by secret villain channel for television was a badly done, deus ex machina. I really hate, how that, scene came into play. Honestly, the scenes in 1968 New York City and the road trip was a real time-waster and should had been cut. Nothing from there, seem that important to the plot. Yes, the Minions meet the Nelsons family, there, but they were very weak human characters. While, I like the voice actors, playing the parents, Michael Keaton as the Dad, Walter Nelson and Allison Janney as the Mom, Marge Nelson. Their interacted with the Minions barely moves the plot, along and their characters were pretty much useless later on the film. I would have, thought, they would end up, being related to Gru (Voiced by Steve Carrell), but it was a big fat red herring that never got, off the ground. Sandra Bullock as Scarlett Overkill was alright as the main baddie, but I was really hoping for more from the character. With a name like overkill, we barely got to see, anything like that, from her. John Hamm is a lot of fun as her nefarious husband Herb, but by far, the Minions are the ones, bringing out the laughs. Kevin, Stuart, and Bob – (all voiced by Kyle Balda), whom Despicable Me fans will remember fondly from the previous films. They are definitely cute. I love, how each one of them, has a unique personality. Kevin is the smart & brave lead, but also has a great snarkiest attitude. Stuart is the impulsive one of the trio; most likely to bring out, the jokes. Bob is the youngest, the most naive and kind-hearted of the trio. He's the one that most people would find, adorable. Honestly, if there was something to nitpick about the movie, it would be, how the movie makes being a criminal seem cool. While, personally, I don't see anything, too wrong, with it. I can see, why certain people might see this as a bad-influence to kids. The Minions are cute and funny. However, they're destined to be disciples to evil masterminds is pretty alarming. One problem that I found a bit, jarring is the way, that they wanted Scarlet to take them, back, after being abuse. It's downright chilling to me. It's like they have Stockholm syndrome mixed with self-hatred. The amount of crude humor, sexual innuendos and lack of heart is also a bit noticeable, here compare to the others films. Still, the filmmakers do fairly well to make sure, that the Minions shenanigans are pretty tame, just to make sure, parents wouldn't overthink those things when coming into this film with their children. Like, I say before, it's difficult to hate them, even with their biggest flaws. I found the humor to be mostly a hit, for me. There were some minor, not so funny moments, but for the most part, it was laugh out funny. The animation is pretty well-made. I love Scarlet's Three Little Pigs story depiction, and how it's in style that looks like stop motion, but still CG. It was pretty cool to look at. Still, I wish, this movie had a more compelling story to match with this great animation. Overall: With their vaguely familiar-sounding language and their penchant for causing chaos, the Minions movie will entertain, both adults and children. Just note, to turn off your brain, when it come to the plot. So check it out and enjoy!"
"Top_Cat84","5","13","23","3 July 2015"," Disappointing..apparently even for kids
","If you've seen the trailer for this then it doesn't matter if you turn up to the cinema 15 minutes late as the beginning is an extended version of it with few extra jokes. The guy next to me obviously had as he fell asleep during it! <br/><br/>The cinema was full of children. Not children laughing. I suspect some were actually bored by it. To be honest, I was expecting more jokes myself but most of it is just a bit predictable and even uninteresting.<br/><br/>The last 10 minutes produces the best parts, but you have to sit through the rest of it to get there. <br/><br/>All in all it was disappointing."

","The little yellow fellows who assist Despicable Me's Gru have, over the centuries, always sought to help the biggest, baddest Boss around. And so, in the 1960s, Stuart, Kevin and Bob, seeking out a new Boss, end up working for villaness Scarlet Overkill as she seeks to usurp the British throne for herself.<br/><br/>The Minions find themselves in their own well-deserved feature, and it's a hoot. The story concentrates on just 3 of the Minions – a smart move, since we get to know them personally – although the full crew do turn up when necessary. Scarlet Overkill is a very good baddie, and the various scenarios are all colourfully realised (London is great, if geographically inaccurate). It is daft, and great fun.<br/><br/>For Beatles fans it is worth mentioning that there is a lovely Beatles-related gag in it. And, while the voice talent is all excellent, it is worth singling out Pierre Coffin, whose voice characterisations in the Minions' almost-language is a huge part of their charm.<br/><br/>The 3D is good in places, but mostly forgettable."
"prospectus_capricornium","7","18","34","8 July 2015"," Too Many Bananas
","There is a conscious effort to generate chuckles in MINIONS, the spin off of the blockbuster animation, Despicable Me. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, nor one that could have been easily shrugged off, but its inevitable persistence, somehow tones down the ingenuity of the bean-shaped yellow cuties, in their first solo (almost) Gru-less outing. In Despicable Me, the heart of the narrative runs on Gru's relationship with three little cute girls, providing heart and soul amid of the massive comic effort delivered to draw brittle laughter from the audience. Such thing is seemingly missing in MINIONS. In their original movies, they couldn't care less whether we're attentive or not of their silly, almost always stupid but laughable choices, but here, they are already working hard to please us, which is somehow distracting, but still never less of a massive entertainment.<br/><br/>The Minions are dedicated henchmen which, even at the dawn of time, are already on the hunt for the evil master they intend to serve, forever. They've gone dedicating their service from a T-rex to the likes of Dracula, and Napoleon, but their very own clumsiness keeps sending their masters to their death. Finally, they brave the harsh coldness of Antartica to settle down, and a civilization of their own, starts thriving for their own keeping. The feat is a moment they would want to remain in forever, but again, without a villainous leader to guide them, there seems no point in going on. Soon enough, the once flourishing minion-isque realm hits a point of stagnation, and nobody could care less of bringing the life back...except the courageous Kevin. With the shy Bob and perpetually screwing (doesn't necessarily mean the other two are any less) Stuart, Kevin embarks on a quest, intending to find the most heinous of all supervillains. That quest leads them to the Scarlet Overkill (Sandra Bullock)in Orlando, and later on for the rest of the movie, in 1968 London. As a villain, she's deadly and ambitious, a combo that would inspire the three to dedicate their full service to her, but both hold dangers of immeasurable scale, for their own safety.<br/><br/>The relentless deployment of slapstick comedy, comes in brimmingly overwhelming amounts, that even most of them don't actually hit their targets, those still-many that landed, are more than enough to make us chuckle. Such abundance comes across as overkill as Scarlet's last name, and at some moments, it fleets with turn out of rudimentary importance, but the laughter generated, no matter how ephemeral, makes up for the narrative mess.<br/><br/>The string of misfortunes of the three, on their way to finding their ""One"" evil master (No, it isn't Overkill), packs a different wallop from the lighthearted emotional sentiments imbued in Despicable Me, and keeps everything running on one lane, desperately pushing efforts to arrive to the point of unnecessariness of its forced efforts to send the edges of our lips to those of our ears. The intention is unwittedly effective, but lingers for too short of a moment, to make us forget what these ridiculous yellow beanies are seemingly up to. It also doesn't add up that Scarlet Overkill is too small to inspire terror in comparison with the colossal allure of the disreputably criminal mastermind Gru. This make paying these little creatures and the story they're into with lingering attention, not easy, but the affection is earned, and their reward is the uncreatively witty one word: ""BANANA""."

","""Minions"" is, without a doubt, worth all the hype. I saw this ""kids"" movie at 9:20 pm on a Tuesday night the theatre was packed.. with adults. The movie follows the evolution of Minions from pretty much the dawn of time until their latest misfortune with their master, Napoleon, puts them into isolation. It is not until Kevin and two volunteers - Stuart, who doesn't really know what he's getting himself into, and Bob - the most enthusiastic, unassuming and freaking adorable minion of all, set off on an adventure to find a new master that the Minion tribe have hope of fulfilling their purpose of serving the most despicable master on the planet. <br/><br/>The minions go through one mishap after another - from starving in the middle of the ocean - to landing in 1960's New York City and spending the night in a department store - to hitchhiking to Orlando with bank robbers - to working for the first female villain, Scarlet Overkill - to Bob becoming the King of England (What, Really? Yes. Really), it's non-stop fun that will have you laughing at their adorable little antics. <br/><br/>Great animation. Great plot. Great humour. Great minions.<br/><br/>What's not to love?"
"supatube","7","17","32","26 June 2015"," A jolly good time cavorting with whimsical yellow bobbing balls – or just a stoner flick.
","So here's the T: it's a spin off film. Should I go down the list of great spin-off films? They've never been too impressive. ""Puss in Boots"" surprised me, which was also written by Minions writer Brian Lynch, but still not as strong as the original film. A spin-off is an odd way to formulate a story, which is why it rarely lands. Characters are usually built into a great story, whereas a spin off will try build a story around great characters. So how much room is there for story telling and how much for the anticipated stand up routine?<br/><br/>The beginning of the film is rather brilliant, joke after joke after joke. And they managed to pull a Kubrick's 2001 and show the evolution of Minions, only a hundred and fifty times faster. But the story is thin. Perhaps because it's a prequel and we know where this is going. No surprises there. And it turns the story into a history lesson of the origins of the Minions, which cleverly goes with the history lesson of London's swinging 60's.<br/><br/>The story is deeply entrenched in London and the 1960's with countless references towards some pretty memorable moments that, not only flew over the heads of the kids watching but, the teenage couple too. And the attention to detail, to bring not only the streets of London but the visual signifiers that transport you to exactly that moment in time where they come from is nothing short of impressive. It really is a slick film. Filled with great signifiers.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock for Violet Overkill was fairly underwhelming considering the characters name is Overkill. It's not to say she phoned it in, but maybe the expectations aren't met. Some actors are just more physical, surprising when her comedic timing is on point. But Overkill's husband - Herb the veraciously funny – is a small part and a necessary one, overkilling Scarlet at any opportunity. <br/><br/>The family picking up the little freaks hitchhiking will definitely leave an impression. But there's quite a bit of small bit part supporting characters thrown in only to drive the story forward. They might be poor story development but the jokes that ensue make it worthwhile.<br/><br/>The language of the Minions was given some thought. I know it's a nonsensical language but having more time on screen this time they had a bit more to say. I could here a mash up of French, Mandarin, and Spanish. Being that they travel the world in search of a leader this influence on their language was a great touch.<br/><br/>In the end this film is really geared towards young children based on the cute factor of the minions - and the publicity strategies in place, but that's a different story. What kids will dig is not something I'm too familiar with. I was surprised a child had an attention span that long. But there it is. For the grown ups however, this is historical hysteria at its best and the film will leave you smiling. In spite of the obvious story, the jokes were great enough to warrant looking forward to watching it again.<br/><br/>Check out keepingitreel.info if you agreed."
"snehithan_vivek","7","17","32","19 June 2015"," Average movie, missed Gru
","2.5/5. A below par movie which made me realize how much I missed Steve Carell as Gru.<br/><br/>The plot of the movie is a total let down. Being a huge fan of the franchise (have watched the first two movies at least 8-10 times combined), I went in with huge expectations. There is absolutely nothing much in the story line. The minions go in search of the ultimate super villain and their quest takes them to Scarlet Overkill (voiced over by Sandra Bullock). Then there is some misunderstanding and she wants to kill the minions and the minions escape from that (obviously,duh!).<br/><br/>The script is mostly gibberish and the writers and creators sticked to slapstick comedy routine to make you laugh. But unlike other two movies, which had a perfect mix of English and Minion language, this one went way overboard with Minion gibberish. Your emotion kind of swings from laughter to irritation to completely ignore the ""minion language"" during the course of the movie.<br/><br/>On the flip side, the iconic pop culture references of the 1960's was really good. The animation was also really great and in some of the scenes it was evident how much effort they put it with all the detailing and architecture.<br/><br/>There are a lot of character deviation of minions. They cared less and were easily distractable. This is what we saw in first two movies. But in this one, all of a sudden, they are one group, taking care of each other, showing emotions like sadness and stuff like that.<br/><br/>On a whole, there is no complex storyline or any moral values or emotional drama. It is just a slapstick humour which is strictly for the franchise lovers. You can take your little kids and they will enjoy it but can't say the same for you."

Don't have much things to expect, kinda let down compares to the two Despicable Me movies (yup, just like the Penguins of Madagascar one). 3.

"moviexclusive","6","16","30","20 June 2015"," The minions have their spin off movie, and with it, lots of moolah from massive merchandising
","It has come to this – we are giggling ourselves silly at some yellow blobs which speak gibberish.<br/><br/>If we had to be the ones to jog your memory, here goes. In 2010's Despicable Me and its 2013 sequel, the protagonists were Gru (voiced by the ever reliable Steve Carell) and his three adopted daughters Margo, Edith and Agnes. How many would actually remember the names of these characters? What you probably brought home were memories of the yellow minions, which, to be fair, are adorable in their blabberish ways.<br/><br/>Oh, you also brought home lots of merchandise (admit it: you have an irresistible urge to join the long queues to own every one of those plastic yellow fast food toys), and boasted to your friends how much you love the minions. As a lead up to this prequel and spin off to the original movies, have you collected all three limited edition yellow cases containing banana flavoured candy?<br/><br/>Ah, the power of marketing, cuteness and gibberish.<br/><br/>So what's in store for viewers in terms of, well, story development? It's sort of like Batman Begins, actually (we kid you not!) because it explains the origins of these yellow creatures. History has it that minions have existed since the beginning of time, evolving from one single celled organisms. They only have one purpose in life: to serve the villainous masters. You probably didn't know T Rex, Genghis Khan, Napoleon and Dracula were served by these creatures, and had their lives destroyed by them too.<br/><br/>The brief but cheeky introduction is really the best bit of the 91 minute movie. Sad thing is, you probably have watched the scenes in the marketing trailers. Moving forward, the minions fell into depression and over the centuries, they managed to remain cute, but never managed to pick up a proper language. Before long, three of them (you can be sure viewers will remember their names long after the credits roll: Kevin, Stuart and Bob) find themselves in New Yorkto serve the world's first female super villain, Scarlet Overkill. Their adventures begin, crossing paths with Queen Elizabeth II and her crown, as well as the mythical Excalibur from the tale Sword in the Stone.<br/><br/>Sounds like a whole lot of fun? For the kids, that's a guaranteed yes. The misadventures of the minions are funnier than the humour from your average weekend morning cartoons. The minions, needless to say, continue to spout nonsensical blabber, and that should have viewers chuckling too.<br/><br/>It is evident that this movie is a money milking cash cow when you see stars like Sandra Bullock voicing Scarlet Overkill (nothing particularly spectacular here, by the way), Jon Hamm as her inventor hubby (his character is a little more fun to watch), and Michael Keaton and Allison Janney as a rather underused bank robbing couple. Geoffrey Rush narrates the story of how the minions have travelled through time, while co director Pierre Coffin is the best voice actor of them all, providing the countless gabbling lines (listen out for something close to home towards the end of the movie!) to entertain his viewers. Big Hollywood names and colourful animation should get the adults' attention, if they aren't already going gaga over the cuteness of the minions already."

","26 June 2015 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Minions. I'm a big fan of Despicable Me and who cannot fail to love the hapless yellow Minions who only live to serve their evil master. This film was much anticipated and although I enjoyed it, my fear of Minion overkill did come true.....just a little bit. With their made up language, these endearing little chaps are entertaining in small doses but just a little too much in their own film. The story was solid......after serving many evil characters through history and unwittingly helping to hasten their demise, the Minions had established a colony but were losing their zest for life, so with the help Stuart and Bob, Kevin sets off to find a new master to unite the Minions once more. Their adventures lead them to Scarlett Overkill (voiced by Sandra Bullock) and ultimately to England where things go so wrong they end up right. I went to The Plaza at 6pm so shared the viewing with a very large number of children, who laughed raucously throughout. If you like Minions, you'll like this film. Interesting twist!!!!!"
"quincytheodore","7","19","37","17 June 2015"," With visual slapstick and retro quirk, Minions is a light fun comedy
","Having mostly gibberish for script, this movie is a prove that visual antics and a few timely noises go a long way to induce laughter. In a throwback to classic setting and comedy, this spin-off might not be bigger than most animations in recent time, but it's still an enjoyable foray. The style of 60s world and era appropriate soundtracks enhance the atmosphere as these peculiar creatures dabble in feeble mischief.<br/><br/>Story follows three particular minions on their way to find the most dreadful villain there is. The journey takes them across the globe until they meet Scarlet Overkill (Sandra Bullock). Graphic-wise Minions is presentable. Though not all of the set pieces are magic, some of the displays, such as the rainy night or monarch architecture are still engaging and presented with nifty details.<br/><br/>The mostly simplistic nature works well, bringing visual cues and lots of squeaking mumbles. It doesn't use elaborate word plays, but this is actually an advantage as the humor is readily accessible for any casual viewer. Several of the jokes are distinctly amusing, though it doesn't fall flat even when a couple of them don't hit the high note.<br/><br/>It also boasts notable pop references of the time, from the ironic quips and its zippy tunes. The human characters can be a bit stereotypical or over-the-top, since these are mostly spoof version of action flick baddies. Its actual villain portrayal might take the name Overkill way too seriously for comical purpose.<br/><br/>The presentation for visual humor is fine and the references are easily relatable. Minions is not a cerebral endeavor or emotional adventure, though these awkward yellow simpletons are notoriously delightful."

I was very happy with this movie because in the beginning it showed that the minions killed the dinosaurs and destroyed the pyramids and I could not stop laughing. It was a very awesome prequel and very cool to show how the minions met Gru in the first place. I think the movie would have been even better if it was a sequel to the regular despicable me. I think in total it was hilarious how the minions were so silly and focused on hurting each other with certain situations. In total, it was one of the funniest movies I have seen."

And to be honest there wasn't much laughing going on. <br/><br/>I'll tell you what I did like: the animation was great, and what I found most appealing as a grown up watching this was the nice little musical references, like Hair and The Beatles, and the soundtrack throughout the whole movie. A few minor laughs here and there but unfortunately that was it.<br/><br/>I would think a kid from 0-10 would like it, just the way it likes most any cartoon. Slapstick comedy, funny talk and cute pet-like beings... The main target is probably this age and there it can't go wrong.<br/><br/>But for older and adults I think it is way too childish."

","Minions is a movie that tells the origin story of the cute, yellow, goggle wearing creatures that gained massive popularity in Despicable Me(2010) & Despicable Me 2(2013). The Minions(Pierre Coffin) have been on Earth, far longer than humans have. They have only one purpose. Find the baddest & most despicable super-villain of all time. Their journey to find the baddest boss takes them on a long & tumultuous adventure. Finding a boss wasn't difficult. However, keeping a boss turned out to be particularly hard due to one hilarious mishap after another. Finally, three Minions namely, Kevin, Stuart & Bob take the initiative to make sure all the Minions have the most evil & despicable boss to work for. This leads the trio to, Scarlett Overkill(Sandra Bullock). Scarlett has nefarious plans to take over the world, with the help of Kevin, Stuart & Bob. <br/><br/>Minions is an extremely funny movie. This is thanks to the goofy antics of the adorable titular characters. I loved the idea of a Villain Con. This film had me guffawing throughout its run-time. However, it lacks the heart & emotional depth of the Despicable Me movies. Characters like, Gru, Margo, Edith & Agnes are missed. Don't worry though. The Minions, with their mildly understandable gibberish & various idiosyncrasies will make this film thoroughly enjoyable for the whole family. Though most of the gags involving the Minions get repetitive, it still manages to crack you up, every single time. The animation & 3D are fantastic. Sandra Bullock is brilliant as Scarlett Overkill. Jon Hamm is amazing as Herb Overkill. Michael Keaton is spectacular as Walter Nelson. Allison Janney is awesome as Madge Nelson. Steve Coogan is good as Professor Flux/Tower Guard. Jennifer Saunders is outstanding as The Queen. Geoffrey Rush is great as the Narrator. I loved Steve Carell's cameo as Young Gru. Last but not the least, Pierre Coffin steals the show as The Minions. A must watch for all fans of the Despicable Me franchise."
"DareDevilKid","7","14","26","5 July 2015"," Not Quite One in a Minion but Far From Despicable Either
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)<br/><br/>Rating: 3.5/5 stars<br/><br/>The Minions' brightly colored brand of gibberish-fueled insanity stretches to feature length in their self-titled ""Despicable Me"" spin off, with uneven but often hilarious results. Admittedly, we had our doubts. Could the Minions carry their own film especially after last year's disastrous ""Penguins of Madagascar"". Thankfully, this spin off film takes the undifferentiated mass of fun and nonsense synonymous with these nearly identical yellow oval creatures, and successfully channels it into a pleasing movie shape.<br/><br/>Minions, as you will know if you haven't recently awakened from a five-year coma, are the ill-defined, much-loved critters that enthusiastically serve the ""Despicable Me"" franchise's Gru. Whenever things are getting a bit saccharine between the formerly dastardly Gru and his accidentally adopted girls, the Minions are there to spout gobbledygook, enact pratfalls, and generally lay on the comic relief. In fact ""Despicable Me 2"" was funnier than its predecessor because it had ""more minions"", so putting the sidekicks center-stage in order to ramp up the laughs further made sense. The conventional cartoon story arcs of self-realization and redemption are skipped, but any sacrifice in emotional resonance is compensated for by the pace and purity of the fun.<br/><br/>A prelude traces the origins of the species as the yellow organisms evolve from silly, single-celled cheerleaders for nasty underwater predators to silly, jellybean-shaped cheerleaders for the T-Rex. Although the opening ""minions through history"" sequence proves a very tough act to follow, this slice of burbling slapstick animation did keep me grinning and giggling throughout.<br/><br/>By the time the 1960s roll around, the group is bored and without leadership. It falls upon heroic Minions Kevin, Stuart, and Bob to journey across the globe to find an ""evil big boss"" they can call their own. The plot follows our adorably unholy trinity from Antarctica to Orlando, where the 1968 Villain-Con unites them with Sandra Bullock's rocket-skirted Scarlet Overkill. Scarlet dreams of being the Queen of England, but a botched Tower of London heist leaves a young Queen Elizabeth II (Jennifer Saunders) in the pub and King Bob on the throne – albeit briefly. It's gloriously silly but still pop-culture- literate stuff, packed with dizzyingly frenetic action and fabulously expressive verbal gobbledygook; the latter largely courtesy of co-director Pierre Coffin.<br/><br/>I started laughing the moment I heard the minions singing the Universal Studios' theme score in their helium-inflected tones, and remained tickled yellow for the following 90 minutes. There's something irresistibly comic about these adorably, amusingly devious little buggers' slapstick pratfalls, the macaronic gibberish they spout and, above all, their blithe bumbling innocence."

","""Minions"" doesn't really have anything new to offer, aside from crassly commercializing the yellow side players in the ""Despicable Me"" movies. You sort of accept that going in. Personally, I've always been fond of the little pill-shaped bastards, which is why I enjoyed this movie. It's 90 minutes of exactly what you'd expect from them and it turns out that's enough to sustain a whole movie. The cast is great, despite the miscast Sandra Bullock (not a slight, I like her) and the humor is just right for a light-as-it-gets Summer movie. The '60s setting also worked surprisingly well.<br/><br/>Honestly, as toy commercials go, you could do a whole lot worse. <br/><br/>7/10"

","This minions is great as usual for its jokes and slapstick comedy with the world's funniest tube-like creatures since the Weebles. It's visually amazing, which one would expect from Illumination pictures but lacks a good story akin to the first Despicable Me film in the series. Many will argue that a good story doesn't matter for the Minions to be entertaining. This is mostly true. Perhaps it's because the film came out running neck and neck with amazing storied films like Inside Out and Home. I wanted to get into the story at least a little bit. I really had no interest in the story of the Minions. It has many holes in it and so much is left unexplained. For example, how long do they live and are these the same ones we see with Gru that are with the T- Rex?<br/><br/>The film works as a set of short films, if taken that way. I think it would have been better to leave out the history and the evil villain played by Sandra Bullock. Watching the little guys hit and slap each other is fun without any need for an underlying story. The one provided is so fragmented and under-developed, it's hard to stay focused on the proved comedy of the Minions.<br/><br/>I wanted to say I liked this film more than all the reviewers saying it's awful. I can't really recommend it as amazing. This, the slapstick stuff everyone loved is there even in the absence of a decent story. Hopefully animation movie makers will try and get a powerful story along with stunning visuals. They go hand in hand for truly great films."

Despite various attempts to find a master to serve that have ended up in disaster such as the dinosaurs, caveman, Dracula, Napoleon Bonaparte, and the Egyptians they remain more determined than ever to find a new master after falling into a funky more of depression, three of the minions named Kevin, bob, and Stuart traveled to New York to attend the villain con convention and meet Scarlett overkill a bad ass female henchwoman and hope she would be their new master.

","Those lil' yellow awesome dumb creatures are back. This time with their cuteness, (Bob), their intelligence (Kevin) and their guitar (Stuart). Their mission – to find the greatest villains of all times. So primarily to seek their purpose in life. Isn't that something we endeavor to do? Minions goes back to its origin and tries to portray 'the how' in the backdrop of the credits. Some of the beginning parts were pretty much included in the trailer itself. There is a narration that helps you understand the whole point like a diegesis (since you can't make out what any of the minion is saying) which dies out pretty soon.<br/><br/>The story is pretty vacuous, if you closely look at it. Nothing much that it has. Seems like a child giving wings to his imagination. You know that it's stupid but you still watch to see what's next. It concludes at an interesting juncture, which as a matter of fact, everybody saw coming.<br/><br/>Humour is mostly slapstick. Weird things keep happening, and you can't really ask why. It beats logic. You just have to accept it and gulp everything that goes beyond the point of explanation.<br/><br/>The movie is a bland spin-off solely intended to rake in moolahs, which I am pretty sure everybody is aware of. It's just that these lil creatures are so cute and adorable that we want to see more of them. Even if there is nothing much for them to do, watching them talk, fall, be themselves, simply makes our day.<br/><br/>So if you don't feel intelligent lately, you have got yourself a movie."
"alexgarcia732805","7","7","11","17 July 2015"," 7--Good for the Kids, Not so Much for the Adults
","It's an animated spin-off film starring creatures that talk gibberish. Obviously you shouldn't be asking for much with a movie like that. But that shouldn't be an excuse for this film to be average. I really liked the first Despicable Me movie, and the second one was OK to me. (In my opinion, it didn't live up to it's predecessor). With ""Minions"", I was cautiously optimistic. <br/><br/>This movie made me think of another animated spin-off that came out a while ago, ""Penguins of Madagascar"". They both suffer from similar issues. Both films feature the antics of (previously-supporting) cast members who mostly provided comic relief. While the minions just mess around and spout nonsense, there still was opportunity to maybe tell a story with them. Unfortunately, the filmmakers failed to do this as best as they could have. <br/><br/>The Nelson family were an amusing bunch of characters, but I think their roles should've been expanded. As they're the first humans Kevin, Stuart, and Bob meet, they should've had more importance and influence on them. The minions are so impressionable, yet the Nelson's don't leave any lasting influence or mark? Scarlet Overkill (Sandra Bullock) and her husband Herb are both fun characters, but neither of them are ever fully developed or made unique in any way. The minions themselves are what you'd expect. <br/><br/>The plot of the movie revolves around villains attempting to steal the Queen's crown. Herb's gadgets make this relatively easy, but if he had them all along, why didn't Scarlet use them to steal the crown earlier? She's very capable, but for some reason lets the minions do the work for her. Why? <br/><br/>I think one of the main reasons this movie exists is to sell merchandise--particularly toys. ""Minions"" is ultimately a dumb, but harmless kid film. It doesn't live up to the first two Despicable Me movies. It's definitely not as good as Inside Out, which came out a few weeks ago. But if you want to watch it, I recommend renting it or seeing it on Netflix. <br/><br/>I have reviewed 40 movies (on Metacritic and IMDb), some recent ones, including: Inside Out, Avengers: Age of Ultron, Fast and Furious 7, The Divergent Series: Insurgent, Taken 3, and more. I also review TV shows. <br/><br/>Notes: The minions' submissive nature and tendency to have a villainous master was actually a pretty interesting concept IMO. It had never occurred to me that the minions had actively sought out masters; in 'Despicable Me' they are all just shown to be employed by Gru and their origins are never really explained."
"hayashimegumi","7","7","11","17 July 2015"," A letdown as it is not as exciting.
","This is probably one of the most honest opinion about Minions (2015) that you will ever read. As a fan of Despicable Me franchise, I thought it was a letdown as it is not as exciting. I could not get the hype anymore especially when the trailers have already spoiled most of the fun part of the film. (I don't usually watch trailers but I totally regretted it for making this as an exception)<br/><br/>Exactly one month ago when I watch the Minions (2015) in Asia, some of my friends asked me about the animated film such as ""Is Minions Nice"" and ""Do you like it more or less than Despicable Me 1 and 2"". My replies to them; whatever I told my friends, are exactly the contents of this movie review. <br/><br/>Honestly, whether it is nice or not, it depends to individuals. As for me, I liked it less compared to Despicable Me. Although it can be enjoyable, ultimately, it is not going to be listed under my favorite animated films. To me, there is nothing new or surprising at all. I am not being mean or extremely critical here but if you know where I am coming from, you would understand. <br/><br/>Another short note, yes, I am aware that this is a spin off, it should be different than the Despicable Me but I thought I could see more of Minions adorable and funny antics...no, I did not laugh much, but I won't deny I did smile a bit watching this. I have seen over one hundred animation the past one year alone and this is my 89th animated review post for my non-stop animated movie marathon by the way so I am not very impressed... <br/><br/>Therefore, if you are not a huge fan of the minions and if you are not that into family films, then there is a high chance that you might not like Minions (2015). Otherwise, you will find this pleasantly enjoyable and for the die-hard fans, it will be the best movie ever as there are many lovable characters throughout the film."

","""Doesn't it feel so good to be bad?"" Scarlett Overkill (Sandra Bullock voice) <br/><br/>Well, I'm feeling ""bad"" because I just saw Inside Out, and Minions is no Inside Out. Inside Out is insightful about the emotions of a pre-adolescent girl, and all of us by extension, yet Minions is a sometimes cute, lightweight animation about goggled, puny pills who speak child-like gibberish that now and then throws in a discernible word like ""boss."" As for insight, there is little, like the little people themselves.<br/><br/>A ""boss"" is what the little travelers are searching for through history until they find permanence with the meanie of the Despicable franchise. The Minions want to serve the worst person in the world, a little like Republicans looking for a leading candidate in a crowded field. Although Scarlett Overkill (Sandra Bullock voice) is a worthy candidate, no one can compete with Gru (Steve Carell).<br/><br/>Along the way of history, the best part of the film for me, they encounter notables like T-Rex and Napoleon, who suffer the danger of the little ones' benign benevolence, always tempered by their colossal ignorance. The funniest for me is their exposing Dracula to direct sunlight.<br/><br/>The most likable historical figure for me is the current Queen Elizabeth (Jennifer Saunders), whose toothy joie de vivre best exemplifies the light-hearted view of history fostered by directors Kyle Balda and Pierre Coffin. The tour of London stereotypes, structures and people, is basic but welcome to this Anglophile.<br/><br/>The best insight into humanity is the child-like character of the minions themselves, whose anarchic behavior is not unlike that of most terrible two's.<br/><br/>My disappointment with Minions may stem from my being a language person frustrated by the animators' attempt to relay emotion and meaning, a la Chaplain and Wall-E, without words. These pill-shaped heroes don't do it for me except to say, ""Well, at least I'm cute."""

","Quickie Review:<br/><br/>Minions from the dawn of time have always searched to serve the most despicable masters in the world. After failing to keep their masters numerous times, the minions feel without purpose. That's when three brave minions, Kevin, Bob, and Stuart set out on a journey to find their new master. Despicable Me franchise has done a lot of things right, one of which that clicked with all ages were the adorable little minions. This film could've been very basic, continuously rehashing a collection slapstick comedy, and just simply depend on the popularity of the minions. Instead, the creators of this film added heart to the characters, delivering a movie that kids will love and adults will have fun with.<br/><br/>Full Review:<br/><br/>As much as I love the minions in the Despicable Me movies, I was quite pessimistic on how good Minions was going to be. It just felt like a cash grab. Of course, all movies aim to grab some cash but this movie in particular felt like the studio was just capitalising on the popularity of the characters. Gratefully, the movie got me to set aside my pessimism.<br/><br/>One of my biggest concerns was whether a collection of side characters can really carry an entire movie. Short answer as it turns out: yes they can. It works because we are focusing on just three minions for the majority of the movie. Each of them have their unique personality that shines through without a single word of comprehensible dialogue. That in itself is an amazing feat, the minion-gibberish is all non-sense and yet I am able to empathise with them. I can't even say the same for actual human actors in other movies sometimes! So in that sense, job well done animators. I also liked the small story arc that was given to the villain of the movie, Scarlett Overkill (Sandra Bullock). She wasn't a villain just for the sake of it, which added another dimension to what could have been a generic character. There is relatable back story to her that made us understand where she was coming from, while still retaining the unpredictable evil-ness.<br/><br/>The movie is not without flaws. There are times where the jokes might be too slapstick for adults to enjoy. These scenes are obviously aimed for the kids. They don't completely alienate us grown-ups but it is still noticeable. On top of that, I have to say I felt the absence of Gru and the kids from the Despicable Me movies. What I love about the minions is their relationship with Gru's family, the pranks, the shenanigans, the care they have for each other, is all so delightful to watch. This absence was bound to happen since we are concentrating on the minions. At the same time, aside from Scarlett Overkill there are no other memorable supporting characters.<br/><br/>Even with the problems, I really did enjoy my time watching Minions. It was a great light hearted, charming, fun movie. If you have little kids, nephews or nieces, don't hesitate to take them to the cinema. They will have an awesome time. Together you too will find some amusing entertainment."

We don't get to see many movies in the theater (maybe 1 or 2 a year) due to the cost so we try to choose our movies carefully. The Minions movie was a complete waste of money for us. My kids were bored and most of the humor was inappropriate for young kids. It should have been rated PG-13 for such a dark theme. So many kids movies these days seem to have a positive message with opportunities for discussion. This one was not one of those movies. We watched Big hero 6 and McFarland on DVD and both movies were a thousand times better than the Minions."

Showing a scene of loyalty, definitely a great finale. <br/><br/>I also liked the fact that it linked with the film Despicable Me, creating a twist. I found the characters e.g. Bob, Stuart and Kevin (The main 3 Minions) very hilarious, I also found the main villain Scarlet misleading and cunning. These two types of characters, add an extra element of comedy to the film.I would have enjoyed it if I where younger and around the age 9 or 10 and I recommend it to a younger audience."

","I saw ""Minions"", starring the voices of Sandra Bullock-The Heat, Demolition Man; Jon Hamm-Mad Men_tv, We Were Soldiers; Michael Keaton-Need For Speed, Jackie Brown; Allison Janney-Mom_tv, The Help and Pierre Coffin-the Despicable Me movies, where he does all the voices of all the Minions.<br/><br/>This is a spin off from the Despicable Me movies. Plus, it is an origin story of the popular Minions, the lovable little yellow henchmen to the super villain, Gru. In fact, it tells how they came to work for Gru-and a young Gru does make an appearance. It tells how the Minions-all of which are voiced by Pierre-whose sole mission in life is to serve an evil villain, go searching for evil bosses throughout the years, starting in prehistoric times and continuing up to 1968. That's when they hear about the world's first evil villainess, Sandra, at a Super Villain Convention; sort of like a Comic Con for villains. Three Minions, Stuart, Kevin & Bob, are chosen to strike out on the search-I guess they figured it would be easier if they all didn't go-and they run into Michael & Allison, a truly dysfunctional family that gives them a ride to the convention. Sandra has a contest for her next group of henchmen and guess who wins? That's right, the Three Stooges.....I mean Stuart, Kevin & Bob and their first job is to steal the crown jewels from Queen Elizabeth 11 in London for Sandra. Jon plays Sandra's husband, who also enjoys inflicting a bit of torture every now & again, when needed. I guess it depends on how much you like the Minions-I do a lot-on whether or not you will like this movie. Some people don't like the way they talk-it is kind of a mixture of several languages, including Spanish, French and lots of others. Every so often, you will hear an English word thrown in for good measure. FYI: I loved the soundtrack. They have lots of good music, both the original artists singing and some with the Minions -or other characters-doing the honors. Just off the top of my head, I remember hearing songs by The Rolling Stones, The Turtles, The Box Tops, The Doors, The Kinks, The Spencer Davis Group, The Monkees, The Who, Van Halen and Jimi Hendrix! As the end credits start, there are some scenes and don't leave early because at the very end is a Beatles musical number involving the whole cast. It's rated ""PG"" for action and some rude humor and has a running time of 1 hour & 31 minutes. I really enjoyed this movie and I would buy it on Blu-Ray."
"TheLittleSongbird","4","18","36","3 July 2015"," Very disappointing and unnecessary prequel
","The first two Despicable Me films were fantastic family fun, so while the idea for a prequel starring the minions did strike me as pointless the trailer was promising. However, what promise the trailer had wasn't really there in the film itself.<br/><br/>Minions isn't without its good points. Apart from some awkward human character designs, the animation is excellent, with its rich bright colours, meticulously detailed backgrounds and imaginative visuals. The killer classic rock soundtrack is another plus, it is very catchy and upbeat while not being too loud or obtrusive. There is a hilarious opening sequence, which is the funniest Minions ever gets and John Hamm does provide a few amusing(but not much more than that) moments. The voice cast deserved much better and didn't shine as much as they ought to, but Geoffrey Rush is a thoughtful narrator, John Hamm has some fun and Pierre Coffin does well characterising the minions.<br/><br/>Regarding the rest of the voice cast though, Sandra Bullock very much underplays her blandly written villain character and the film makes a complete waste of Michael Keaton. Everybody else suffers from not having much to do or being underused, the Nelsons could have brought some heart to the story but weren't used anywhere near enough and were quite bland. The story suffers from being structurally thin, with very little narrative padded out to try and sustain the running time (which it did sometimes struggle to do) and rushed, and had very little of the heart and charm that the first two Despicable Me films did. It is also incredibly predictable and has very little different that sets it apart from other origin stories, and felt like an extended version of the trailer.<br/><br/>Generally, the humour isn't smart or sharp enough and there is not enough of it(the very aimless second half is especially lacking in the laughs department), some of it veering on juvenile and with little for adults to enjoy (a mistake seeing as what made the two Despicable Me films so winning was that they had something for everyone). The script is more muddled and over-stuffed (from trying to cram in too many types of humour) than clever, and has some clumsy attempts at acting hip and cool. As said before, there is not much heart or charm here, and the lack of truly memorable characters and lack of identifiable themes is a huge part of the problem. The minions are very funny supporting characters and scene stealers in the Despicable Me films, but they are not utilised enough and they don't seem strong enough to be leading characters carrying the film on their own, so what made them so appealing at first is lost here.<br/><br/>In summary, very disappointing and unnecessary prequel. 4/10 Bethany Cox"
"Troy_Campbell","7","15","29","20 June 2015"," A bundle of silly fun.
","By the time the end credits rolled on the first Despicable Me, the gibbering, yellow henchmen had already outgrown their malevolent master. Finally (and unsurprisingly) getting their own movie, this prequel begins with a clever montage charting the evolution of the eponymous critters as they follow one doomed boss after the other. Settling in to the 1960's for the bulk of the adventure, this whimsical comedy focuses on three brave minions who journey to Orlando – for a villains-convention of course – then London, in search of another boss. Not all the jokes work and chief new addition Scarlett Overkill (Sandra Bullock) lives up to her name in the worst possible sense, but the gag rate is so high there is still a healthy dose of laughs. The trademark minion chatter has evolved with an increase in recognisable words but remains just as amusing, whilst the cheeky visual gags and hidden references ensure there's humour for all ages. Where this film differentiates itself from the Despicable flicks though, is by homing in on, and adding depth to, a specific trio of minions: optimistic leader Kevin, laidback crooner Stuart and the indefatigable ball of joy Bob. Another bonus for the parents in the crowd is the ridiculously good soundtrack featuring classics from The Beatles, The Doors, Jimi Hendrix, The Turtles, The Kinks, Aerosmith and The Who, to list but a few. More of a carefree, in-the-moment joyride rather than an animated heavyweight with lasting power, Minions is a bundle of silly fun."

","Nowadays, when I see an animated movie like this, I pretty much expect it to entertain me as much as the target audience of children. The bar has been set that high. Unfortunately (at least for me), this one is pretty much just for the kiddies.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Minions"" tells the story of, well, the Minions! While the little mischief- makers were well established in the Despicable 1/2 films, this one explains how they came to meet Gru. For thousands of years, they wandered the earth looking for the meanest bad guy to serve, from cavemen to dinosaurs to Yetis. In more recent times, they fall in with Scarlet Overkill (Sandra Bullock), who is intent on stealing the Royal Crown (quite literally) from the Queen of England (Jennifer Saunders). As per usual, the Minions' frantic antics make this an almost impossible task, with one even being crowned King himself (King Bob!).<br/><br/>Simply put, ""Minions"" is a fun romp for any audience of children. The gags will elicit laughs, and just the concept of Minions in general is still enough to hold interest. Kevin, Bob, & Stuart (the main three Minions featured) will enthrall kids for the whole 90 minute runtime.<br/><br/>Because of how high the animation bar has been set, though, I can't help but rate ""Minions"" a pedestrian 3-stars by my own standards. Maybe that isn't fair to the film, but it is from my own personal perspective. This one doesn't have, say, the wry humor of a ""Toy Story"", and emotional punch of other Pixar efforts, or even the sincere sweetness of its two predecessors. It's just silly, goofy fun.<br/><br/>So, if you have kids, put this on and it will be a rollicking hour and a half of laughter. Just don't expect to become invested in the cartoonish fun like you probably have been in the past."

I'm not so certain there is a true story line in this movie and that is the biggest issue.<br/><br/>I often find that part 3 of any movie title is going for quick cash and didn't take the time and effort that a normal animated movie goes through. But again, I work hard to only base each movie on it's own merit. Just a quick fact that a lot of the 3rds (like Madagascar 3; Toy Story 3, and others) are rarely put together well. Which saddens me as I look forward to each and every one with great anticipation.<br/><br/>I think this movie could have been cute had they worked harder on the story and taken a bit longer for release.<br/><br/>And I thought Sandra Bulluck wasn't a great choice as a voice in an animated flick. Her voice comes off a bit flat, it's her expressive face that makes her a good actress and with a voice over part in animation that doesn't work. At least not as a lead character, in my opinion.<br/><br/>I am a huge collector of animated flicks and I haven't bought this one yet. I borrowed a friends who wasn't happy with it. After seeing it I can't bring myself to be willing to spend the money to own it. Maybe if it ever ends up on Craigslist for 3 bucks I will.... maybe..."

","I had a hunch that I wasn't going to like it but wow, I should not have seen this! This is one of those unforgettable atrocities that absolutely make you despite the very things you once found adorable and although it's quite evident that this stupid vile piece of crap is aimed at kids, does it really have to be this pathetic for the rest of the viewers who were left with no choice but to accompany those little rascals & sit through this unbearable torture?<br/><br/>A spin-off to the Despicable Me series that also serves as a prequel, Minions tells the story of its titular characters; the small, yellow henchmen of Gru who have been around since the very beginning and have served the most despicable of masters throughout their existence. The plot follows three of them who, in order to find their group a new master, venture out of their isolation and into Orlando where they meet the world's first female supervillain at the Villain-Con.<br/><br/>Written by Brian Lynch and directed by Kyle Balda & Pierre Coffin, Minions neither features a script nor any sort of direction for it is one of the dumbest productions ever green-lighted by any studio. From the very opening scene when these minions accompany the Universal logo, you can feel your intuition telling you to walk out. But the level of annoyance & highly off-putting human characters that inhabit this turd turn it into an experience that many will regret for the rest of their lives.<br/><br/>Although minion madness was a surprise delight in Despicable Me, it worked because they were effectively used to support the relevant characters. Despicable Me 2 did upgrade their time on screen & was a laughter riot in a way but it also exhibited inferiority in story quality when compared to its predecessor. But to allocate an entire picture based on these yellow little bastards is a huge mistake for it simply kills the fun by overdoing it and with no story or character development, it's just not worth it.<br/><br/>And yet the worst thing about Minions isn't the minions but the extremely forced & childish attempts at humour as well as the few human characters that are penned into the storyline. The gibberish insanity becomes dull sooner than expected, the narration that accompanies the plot was unnecessary, the villain is one of the worst ever imaginable, it feel too long for a 90 minutes movie, animation isn't much of an issue but everything around it is, and from start to finish, it's filled with nothing but one terrible scene after another.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Minions is an uninspiring, unnecessary & mind-numbingly awful movie that not only goes down as one of the worst films of the year but is also amongst the worst films ever made. There are a couple of amusing moments but for the most part, this movie is a ghastly, repulsive & all-out flat experience that's capable of totally destroying your love for the little yellow freaks, if there was any. Too much of a good thing can have devastating consequences and Minions is definitely a strong testament to that. Skip it or suffer."
"charliep14","6","2","2","29 August 2015"," Not as funny as the trailer let it to be
","The movie is good for a few chuckles and does have some very entertaining moments. What is actually by far the funniest is the ""minion speak""; especially if you understand some french, it does have some layers in it (Papaouté; c'estparlà etc.) and is definitely funny. It also is a very beautiful CG movie. Though it is customary to say that with every new CG movie, this one is absolutely gorgeous, with some great character designs and some cool visuals. But, honestly, didn't laugh all that often. The trailer lets you believe it will be a very very funny movie and was not, it was a cool adventure with some funny characters - left me wanting more. The voice acting was also, with the exception of the minions, nothing incredible."

","Minions (2015): Dir: Kyle Balda, Pierre Coffin / Voices: Sandra Bullock, Jon Hamm, Michael Keaton, Allison Janney, Steve Coogan: After the success of two Despicable Me animations, it was destiny that the Minions get their own films. They are the yellow pill shaped gibberish talking servants whose only desire is to serve a master villain. We are given their origins and their failed attempts to find super villain to serve. Amongst the hundreds of them, Kevin, Bob and Stuart decide to journey off to find a super villain to lead them. After hitchhiking with a family whose Sunday drive consists of robberies, they are off to an event called Villain Con. The starring attraction is a female super villain by the name Scarlett Overkill whose outfits are armed with nuclear weapons. This becomes a bit much but Sandra Bullock vamps it up as the snarling female whose latest conquest regards stealing the Queen's crown. She eventually recruits the willing Minions to assist her until the plan backfires leaving Stuart with the crown. Jon Hamm has fun voicing Overkill's loyal douchebag husband whose torture tactics turn into fun and games for the Minions. The screenplay is detailed and hilarious with many great moments including a sequence where Kevin ends up growing to heights that may remind viewers of Mr. Stay Puff in Ghostbusters. Another grand moment regards a climatic counter where a familiar super villain makes an appearance and gains loyalty from the legion of Minions. Colorful animation full of hilarious antics and festive imagery but ultimately the film serves to highlight the servants of the most ""despicable"" super villain of them all. Score: 9 / 10"

","I think this is an excellent movie. It was teased at in the credits of Despicable Me 2. If you liked that movie you will like this one. Also I feel like this is a movie a whole family can watch and enjoy. So I recommend it for family night.<br/><br/>Some people will not like the Minions because they do not speak English. They do speak some English words, as well as words from several other languages including their own made up ""Minionese"". So some people do not like this.<br/><br/>I do not consider the following as spoilers because it is in some of the trailers, but some people avoid the trailers because they want no spoilers at all. So the following may contain spoilers:<br/><br/>This movie follows the Minions from the beginning of time/life until they meet Gru, the main character from the movie ""Dispicable Me"". It shows them evolving as single cell organisms and living in Antartica. The three main minions of the movie include the leader of the group named, Kevin; the joker of the group, Stuart; and the cute one, Bob. They represent the Oldest, Middle, and Baby brother. Growing up in a big family, I enjoyed how they interacted in these roles. <br/><br/>This movie is a Prequel for the two Despicable Me movies. While it focuses on the Minions, Gru makes a cameo at the end. This sets up the relationships between Gru and the Minions in the Despicable Me movies."

My 5 year old brothers are minion super fans, and they laughed a lot in this movie. All of the jokes are more slapstick and mainly for kids. I would definitely say that the two ""Despicable Me"" movies are better, however, this movie is about cute yellow characters who speak a bit of English, a bit of Spanish, and a bit of gibberish. The ""Minions"" movie is made for kids, so remember that. If you go into the theater expecting a good movie with a rich plot, boy, will you Be disappointed! However, if you are going in with your kids or siblings just so they would be entertained, you will be very happy. It deserves a 7.5 out of 10, but if I had to choose, it would round down to 7."
"keithlovesmovies","7","11","20","11 July 2015"," Minions Review
","Alive since the beginning of time, Minions live to serve the biggest, baddest, and most evil. After a series of unsuccessful masters find a way to perish, the Minions no longer have someone to work for, a purpose to live and they all being to grow depressed. But one minion finally decided to do something, Kevin, along with Bob and Stuart venture into the world to find their people a new evil boss to work for. Their search culminates in them meeting Scarlet Overkill (Sandra Bullock), the world's first ever evil super villainess.<br/><br/>Let's be honest, there wasn't really a need for this movie other than an excuse to put Minions in a movie. This movie will inevitably make lots and lots of money. They're cute, they talk funny, and they act funny. Kids (myself included) loved them from the 2 Despicable Me films and they (and I eventually will) probably have all of the related merchandise. Kids will want to see this one too and get all the eventual merchandise that will come from it.<br/><br/>Now to the film! Even though I am an adult, I liked it. I mentioned that I liked the 2 Despicable Me films and the thing I liked the most from them was the Minions. Despite all of these years, they still haven't gotten old for me. But the question is could they carry a movie? The answer is no. Don't get me wrong, I like the Minions and the movie is called Minions but it did not have to focus on them as much as it did. There are other human characters in the film like Scarlet Overkill and her husband Herb (Jon Hamm) and also this family of bank robbers. I felt that they were a little underused and a little more of them would have provided some balance. Another thing that was underused was the narrator. He was used in the beginning of the film just so the viewers can understand what was going on. It could sometimes be difficult to understand what is going on when all you see is a bunch of Minions speaking gibberish. There were moments later on where more explanation would have helped. The story is simple enough. The film is a prequel to the 2 Despicable Me films so it takes place in the 60s so you'll get all the time-appropriate references and a soundtrack with 60s music so you'll get your Beatles, your Who, etc. The slapstick humor will keep the kids entertained and the 60s references will entertain the adults. Some of the reviews have mentioned that the plot is not compelling but I was fine with it. I would have liked it if some of the writing for some of the human characters was a little better. It wasn't terrible but I what I liked about the Despicable Me films was how the human characters interacted with the Minions. If I had to compare this film to the Despicable Me films, this one would place third behind 1 and then 2. I personally can't wait until their next film which will be Despicable Me 3 which comes out in 2017."
"Chris12955","8","11","20","10 July 2015"," So much fun it's a crime.
","Does Minions have a solid story? NO. Well rounded characters? NO. A touching message? NO. OH WHO CARES! Minions did have one thing in spades, FUN! Those little guys who stole the background of Despicable Me have their own spin off/prequel, and it is everything I expected. Jokes jokes jokes and more jokes surrounding those wacky Minions. I got a lot of enjoyment from Kevin Bob and Stuart, and the zany world they inhabit. The 3D was well used, and you can tell Illumination sunk more money into the animation on this one. Thankfully the wonderfully quirky character designs that made the first two so memorable are here as well(although I would have preferred the backgrounds to have received the quirky styles of the first two as well, but we can't have everything.)<br/><br/>Minions opens with an explanation of the Minions origin, perhaps the highlight of the film is this period of about ten minutes which is a total gem. Flash forward to 1968(the film is brimming with references to the year which may, or may not, add to your enjoyment if you get them) and the Minions need a new evil master. So Kevin, the most intelligent and intrepid of the Minions, decides to venture forth in search of one, aided by the innocent Bob and inept Stuart. The trio meets up with Scarlet Overkill, the baddest villain of them all who takes them into her service.<br/><br/>It loses energy about three fourths of the way through the picture, and is about fifteen minutes too long, making this the weakest of the Despicable Me films. Having said that, it was still a very amusing film that does absolutely no harm to the Despicable Me franchise. This is exactly what you would expect from a Minions movie, a delightfully warped world where those yellow weirdos entertain with their childish antics to bring a smile to your face."
"trooper5783","9","10","18","22 July 2015"," The better movie out of the Despicable Me franchise.
","After reading mixed reviews, I was still pumped to see Minions, but a little bit suspicious about if it will be an average kids spin-off that's meant to sell plush toys and Happy Meals. Therefore, I saw the 3D 3:20 screening of the film and- surprisingly, it was a great, cute, and fun movie for all ages to enjoy! The story at first parodies documentaries in a genuinely quirky technique, followed by a few hilarious antics caused by the minions!! But the story also follows the quest of three minions(Kevin, Bob, and Stuart) to find a new boss to work for. This part also is executed very cleverly, with plenty of British stereotype jokes that made me laugh hard and slapstick comedy that made me giggle like Looney Tunes!! Although a few of the funniest gags are in the ads and Sandra Bullock feels phoned in, the movie was hysterical, beautiful to look at(especially in 3D), and the voice actors are top notch. Plus, there is a cameo that I won't spoil, but it's pretty damn awesome. Hell, even the soundtrack was EPIC, no pop songs at all!! Overall, Minions is a hilarious treat for everyone filled with laugh out loud moments and charm. See it in 3D also, you won't miss a thing."
"rudolfravbar","7","10","18","29 June 2015"," Funny, but that's not it!
","So, this movie disappointed me a bit, but not that much.<br/><br/>Minions Stuart, Kevin and Bob went on a journey to find a super-villain, which will they serve. On their journey, they went to VillainCon (I think it was called like that) and they started to serve one of the best villains in the world (America), Scarlet Overkill. They helped her to steal a crown. <br/><br/>This movie is not that good as Despicable Me, but it's better than Despicable Me 2. In the first one, minions are funnier than in this one called Minions, which is a shame. Of course, this movie is funny, but there are some jokes that are here for the kids. The movie's ending is great. After I saw young Gru and when his theme song started playing, I was being like:""OK, I think this is one of the most awesome movie (animated) I ever saw."" The funniest joke in this movie is when minions came to the VillainCon (again, don't know if it's called like that), and Scarlet came at a stage with her awesome dress, dude dressed like her screamed:""I love you, Scarlet!"" I mean, that was hilarious. Also, I really liked that moment when Scarlet told minions a ""bed-time story"" (which was cruel), Bob fell asleep. Characters (Bob, Stuart and Kevin) are done well in this movie. They have a lot of chemistry together. They are always all together and they are different. Kevin is brave and he is a chief. Bob is like a child. He is playful and scared. And Stuart, nahh... He is just hungry.<br/><br/>At the end, this was a really short review, but I have nothing else to say. I mean, jokes were mostly funny, characters have a good chemistry, ending is badass and... That's it. This movie is not that good as I was thinking it'll be, but it was good."

","Minions is the prequel to Despicable Me when the minions are seeking the greatest villain to serve. Unsuccessful in their search, they retreat to a cave in the arctic, but Kevin (one of the minions who makes the most appearances in the Despicable Me films) refuses to give up and so ventures on a quest to find the minions a master. Joined by Stewart and Bob, they travel to Orlando where they discover the most celebrated villainess to date: Scarlet Overkill. After a competition, she hires them to work for her and her first assignment for them is to bring her Queen Elizabeth's crown. However, the minions do something entirely different...<br/><br/>Having watched the trailer, I already acknowledged the plot. If I dissect it, the first half an hour is golden and thoroughly enjoyable. The humour came thick and fast and I felt eager to see what the remainder of the film would bring...needless to say, I was slightly disappointed. The villainess determined to prove that females can be as malicious as males, not to mention the fact that she desires the queen's crown in order to become the queen herself, is all too familiar. What could have been an invigorating plot that distinguishes itself from that of other action and adventure stories for children starts as superb but becomes cliché-ridden and predictable from the middle onwards. Despite this, the ending was perfectly satisfying and Gru being introduced to the minions was a great addition.<br/><br/>The minions are all likable with Kevin, Stewart and Bob delivering the most laughs and being the three minions which are different from the rest. However, the human characters were much less impressive. Scarlet Overkill is the stereotypical villainess who intends to prove that women can do evil as well as men and dreams of being queen, when she could have been a single woman who craves company and some thrills in her life. She is the main issue I have with the film, whilst the other humans who made an appearance were just plain.<br/><br/>I must commend the animation used, for it is impeccable. The same foulproof animation which is used in the Despeicable Me films is used here and it is pleasing to the eye. Clearly, just as much dedication has been put into this film than what was put into the Despicable Me films.<br/><br/>Overall, Minions is a brilliant family film which both children and adults will admire, but it could have been so much better had it not been for the aggravating clichés which crop up in the middle."

","A spin off of Despicable Me tells the origin of Gru's minions (who I always assumed he created in his lab) as they attempt to find a suitable evil master. A few years before Gru, the minions find Scarlet overkill voiced by Sandra Bullock. <br/><br/>At first I was not sure about Scarlet, but she turned out to be pretty evil overall. <br/><br/>It was a fun little movie that lives up to the popularity of the Despicable Me franchise and a cool extension of it, but not as charming without Gru leading the minions, it kinda misses it's point. <br/><br/>There suppose to be evil minions yet there so cute and cartoony you can't help but to smile through out the film.<br/><br/>One really cool thing about the minions is that they always do some really cool stuff in 3D, so it's worth seeing in 3D. <br/><br/>Cheers to Universal for milking the success of their animated blockbuster, with a spin-off movie with a good story line a great villain, and some great animation."
"CleveMan66","7","9","16","10 July 2015"," ""Minions"" is a lot of fun and a great family movie, but may be too much of a good thing.
","In 2010, Illumination Entertainment released its first animated feature film, ""Despicable Me"", about an evil genius named Gru who was struggling to stay on top of the evil genius business, with the help of his pint-sized henchmen known as minions. That film made over $250 million in the U.S. alone (almost quadruple what it cost), so, naturally, there was a sequel. In 2013, ""Despicable Me 2"" made over $368 million domestically and was rated by audiences as even better than the original. The minions were a small big reason for all that. They were a hit in the first film and they played a larger role in the second film, which performed even better than the first, so, naturally, they got a movie of their own.<br/><br/>The minions are child-sized, yellow, pill-shaped creatures whose sole purpose in life is to serve an evil master. Some are a little taller than the others, they have slightly different styles of (sparse) hair, some have two eyes and some have one, but all wear goggles and they speak in a kind of child-like babble which combines English, Spanish, French and possibly bits of a few other languages too (it's kind of hard to tell). Oh, and one more thing – they're simply and completely ADORABLE! In spite of their evil inclinations, these are simple-minded, child-like innocents who mainly want to have fun and fulfill their potential as minions. And they are front and center in ""Minions"" (PG, 1:31).<br/><br/>This sequel to the ""Despicable Me"" movies is really a spin-off and also a prequel, which takes us back to the beginning of the minions' story – ALL the way back. We see how the minions originated and, through a short series of vignettes, we observe their well-meaning, but hilariously botched attempts to serve a wide variety of ill-tempered masters throughout history. Finally, they are driven into exile in an ice cave in Antarctica. They build a civilization and do their best to entertain themselves, but without a master to serve, they're unbearably bored. So, in 1968, Kevin (voiced by co-director Pierre Coffin, who does all minion voices), a tall(ish) minion, tells his tribe he's going on a quest to find them a new master. With only the extremely child-like minion (even by minion standards) named Bob, and a ""volunteer"" named Stuart to help, Kevin begins his journey.<br/><br/>The three minions end up at Villain Con, a secret convention of super villains and their fans, where the minions meet and get hired by Scarlet Overkill (Sandra Bullock), the first female supervillain. Scarlet is taking her typical girlish fantasy of being a princess a little too seriously. She wants her newly-hired helpers to steal the British crown jewels so she can be Queen of England. Scarlet's husband, Herb (John Hamm) sets up Kevin, Stuart and Bob with a variety of his evil inventions and they embark on their mission. Of course, this being the minions, nothing goes according to plan, one thing leads to another, Scarlet feels as if the minions have betrayed her, and she sets out to get revenge on Kevin, Stuart and Bob, while still trying to accomplishing her goal. Meanwhile, the rest of the minions have received word that Kevin has found them a new master in the U.K. and the entire tribe is working to get there ASAP.<br/><br/>""Minions"" has a slightly different target audience than the ""Despicable Me"" films and feels like a little too much of a good thing. Don't get me wrong – I LOVE me some minions, but they're schtick can wear thin. Even their powerful minion cuteness can't sustain an entire film. Plus, while the ""Despicable Me"" movies seemed to appeal nearly equally to kids, teens and adults, the minions' spin-off is more squarely aimed at kids. The animation, voice work and story are all as strong as the previous films in which the minions appeared, but the humor in this one aims a little lower. The adults will enjoy the soundtrack and there are plenty of cute, clever, and funny moments. ""Minions"" works well as a family movie, but I think the little yellow guys should stick to being fun, naughty side-kicks. It's what they do best. ""B+"""
"tristan6252","7","9","16","9 July 2015"," A pretty decent film!
","Minions was a pretty good film, I mean the animation was top notch, and the jokes were very good (at some points). The main minions in the film Kevin, Bob and Stuart were fairly funny at times, and the fact that they couldn't speak English added another funny mark to it. If you have seen the Despicable Me franchise, then you probably know who the minions are, but if you haven't seen the Despicable Me franchise, then before you watch Minions, I recommend you see Despicable Me 1 and 2, As that is where they were first introduced to the world. Moving on, some villains in the film, seemed a bit rushed just to get on with the movie, and some of them were unnecessary, but overall they each had their own funny scenes. The main villain Scarlett Overkill, had a crazy personality, and had some good humor which added a nice ring to the film, as well as that the Minions were always there to mess with her, So it was an action packed- family fun film :)<br/><br/>Overall: I recommend you watch this, it has some funny moments and is a perfect spin-off to the Despicable Me franchise. I hope you enjoy the film :)"

","Shrek's Puss in Boots, the Penguins of Madagascar, and the Minions of Despicable Me were all inevitably going to get the full feature length treatment. All three have proved to be a little disappointing, but Minions is the least disappointing of the three.<br/><br/>It is the danger of sidekicks that they are perceived to be bigger than their parent movies. The Minions with their gabbly language and cheerful ineptitude, their ignorance of any sort of consequences of their actions and their irrepressible joie-de-vivre are hugely engaging and entertaining creatures. Do they have the capacity to carry a 90 minute movie – well yes, but only just.<br/><br/>When I saw this there was only small child in the cinema (on a schoolday?) and she laughed loudly throughout the prologue but not once thereafter. There you have it in a nutshell! Perhaps she ought to write a review for IMDb. I found it amusing and interesting with its superb score and references to 60s culture. I thought the human voice overs were OK, with Jennifer Saunders and Sandra Bullock standing out, but the plot seemed a bit stretched in places, especially in London.<br/><br/>The final link in the Minions' story when they made their last connection and found their ideal master was excellent and tied everything up neatly but I got the feeling that a lot of chances for Minion mayhem were missed. I did, however, laugh at the torture chamber scene – only the Minions could treat a medieval torture chamber like an adventure playground – brilliant.<br/><br/>So yes, not the triumph it could have been but neither the disaster it could have been. 7/10."
"RevRonster","8","8","14","16 July 2015"," How can you not like these little guys?
","It honestly was just a matter of time before this film happened because those little guys called the Minions quickly inserted themselves into pop culture and took the world by storm. What's not to like about them? They're adorable, they like bananas (because they're delicious), and they're funny. I really enjoyed their escapades in ""Despicable Me"" and its sequel so, needless to say, I was all aboard for this film.<br/><br/>The story of Minions is a funny and entertaining one that is created with great voice acting and fantastic animation. Additionally, the film has just an absolutely fantastic soundtrack filled with killer tracks from the late 60s rather than the bubblegum pop from the ""Despicable Me"" films. The only thing I really didn't care for was how underwhelming Scarlett Overkill was as not just a character but how she was voiced by Sandra Bullock. She's not overtly terrible as the antagonist but she doesn't feel like she's giving her all to the role. This sorta mirrors how the character doesn't feel as threatening as she could be or as larger-than-life as she needed to be.<br/><br/>My complaints are minor for this one because, at the end of it all, it's still pretty fun and entertaining. This movie could have easily been just phoned it and slapped together with some cheap jokes and a presentation that would make it feel like it was straight from the bargain bin but the final product was a very funny movie that delivers a very cute and satisfying Minions adventure."

","We've all had moments where we speak gibberish, but none of us match the skill level of babbling utter nonsense like the Minions of Despicable Me. The cute, cuddly, yellow bodied blobs have entertained for the past few years with their antics, communicating in their special language that remains undecipherable to me this day. Turns out they are so popular Hollywood has decided to give them their own movie, one that is sure to provide hours of fun for all ages alike. So with all the advertisement and hype, you may be wondering what this movie has in store. Fortunately I am here to help, so sit back and read the latest review. <br/><br/>If I were to summarize this movie in one word it would be CUTE. The animation studio has managed to bring all the cuddliness of Gru's henchmen and unleash it tenfold on the screen. Sure there were some adorable moments in Despicable Me movies, but Minions takes it to the next level with squeaky voices, petite faces and huggable goodness. Boys and girls, men and women of all ages will be awing as our three heroes traverse the elements to find their new boss. Bob in particular was the cutest as he jumps into the adventure with eager eyes, and a beat up teddy bear. In truth it is like watching three small children go on an impossible voyage, constantly failing, but doing so in a manner that pulls at your heart strings. <br/><br/>Minions is also a very happy and energetic movie, the youthful antics of the minions bringing a positive vibe to the theater that you feed on. The movie is simply fun, the pint sized aspiring villains living life to the fullest as they explore the city. Because of their enhanced biology, or whatever force makes them nearly invincible, the sky is the limit for what troubles they can get into. Normal devices that are meant to be horrifying, or extremely violent have now been diluted to playground level fun, sugar coated with the Minion cuteness to distract from their true meaning. Bombs, guns, bank robbing, etc, it's all just a big game run by naïve munchkins and a world full of extreme personalities that make for very one dimensional characters. <br/><br/>Surely you are asking one thing in your mind though, is it funny? The answer is yes, Minions is definitely a humor filled movie targeted for the young and young at heart. Slapstick comedy unfolds as the Minions pull off three stooges ploys as they slap, crush, and blow up everything around them. Their klutziness, and again their versatile bodies, allows reality to be shattered and for them to survive anything. As you can guess the Minions gibberish is also very entertaining, the random babbling made funny in the delivery as they add their voice modifications to the mix. Again Bob has the funniest sounds, as his high pitched squabble makes him my favorite. Voices and slapstick aside, the funniest aspect for me are the built in references to the movie in terms of song and movie numbers. I spent my time trying to figure out what movies the scenes were from, having to rely on my mentor to help fill in some of the details, especially those that were about classic bands or plays. Whatever source you find funny, let it be known that Minions is going to get you chuckling at some point in the film. However<br/><br/>Like everything there is a balance that is greatly needed in its film and the major downfall of this movie is doing too much of one thing. First the gibberish thing, it's nice to get that ridiculous language in spurts like in Despicable Me, but in this movie it took too much focus. A lack of dialog was annoying, the mindless gibberish losing its appeal to me, especially when there was a lack of supporting dialog to relieve us from the antics. The slapstick saved it somewhat, the variety in the comedic situations assisting with keeping things fresh. My friend pointed out that Minion antics are fun in small doses, which this movie abuses. The young and obsessed won't care, but I could have used a better story to ground the adventure a bit. The simplistic tale was also not the most thrilling, the tale very formulaic and lacking in character development. Even the villain Scarlet Overkill didn't hold much strength, and was thrown to the back behind the minions. In addition, about half the movie had been revealed in the six trailers they have shown, especially the fun opening, but the parts that weren't ruined are still entertaining. The limited voice acting is decent, but when all you are doing is babbling like an idiot, there isn't much to really be impressed with, even with the great Sandra Bullock leading the group. <br/><br/>Minions is the adventure you are all expecting it to be, a mashup of cute, positive, fun that will have you chuckling most of the way. Chances are if you are obsessed with the little guys in Despicable Me, you are going to find no fault in this movie. However, Minions leaves a lot to be wanted, including story, character development, and some more clever humor that could work with the language. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed myself with a lot of the humor here, but my scores have to entail everything. I recommend a trip to the theater with a group, or taking your young ones, but please don't be persuaded to see the 3-D version. <br/><br/>My scores are: Animation, Comedy, Family: 7.5-8.0 Movie Overall: 6.5-7.0"

","Ever since watching Despicable Me I'm totally in LOVE with the Minions. Everyone around me knows me for being sorta crazy about these little yellow dudes. Minions are just AWESOME!<br/><br/>So, when I learned there would be a Minions movie I was in ecstasy really... But, as time progressed and more information became available about the movie my expectations started to drop.... Part of the magic of Minions was NOT knowing where they came from. But, hey, they are Minions! So, of course I needed to see the movie. And I'm truly sorry I did. Horribly disappointing! No story what so ever (I mean, at least 15 minutes with a voice over needed to explain what the movie is about says it all!). All jokes were already in the previews. Nothing exciting, nothing really funny. Just pure- and utter boredom! I really regret ever seeing this movie. It takes the Despicable Me movies down with it. I can give everyone who hasn't seen this movie only one advise: DON'T even think of watching this movie!! It's nothing more then a cheap spin-off intended to make a lot of money on the success of the Minions in the Despicable Me movies. Even the music was recycled from the previous movies and games. I'll try to forget seeing this movie and will stay away from it as far as I possibly can! Horrible, horrible, horrible! Shame on everyone responsible for creating this monstrosity.<br/><br/>Phew, it does feel good to have this off my mind..."
"claudia_lampl5","3","10","19","3 September 2015"," Big disappointment
","I remember how excited I was when I first heard that they are going to make a Minions movie. Since the moment friends of mine dragged me into Despicable me 2, I was in love with those movies. It makes me actually sad to talk negatively about this movie but I feel that those yellow tic-tacs not only stole the crown but also my money and all the fun that I was expecting to have. <br/><br/>I wonder what I really thought I was going to see in a movie about walking Twinkies, laughing about words like butt, which have limited ways to express themselves verbally and were never meant as main characters. In Despicable me it works because we see their relationship with Gru. It was something fresh and new, seeing a bad guy/villain treating his henchmen with such care and respect. Their work for Gru felt genuine. The minions movie doesn't really contain any heart that made the previous movies so beloved and popular. <br/><br/>Kevin, Bob and Stuart are not real characters in the way you expect them to be. They are certain stereotypes and thats where it ends. Kevin is the leader, Stuart a rebel and Bob is cute. The movie never slows down and really goes into detail about their relationship with each other (with the exception of Kevins care towards Bob but I really wished there were more scenes like that). There is no character arc, nothing to be learned for them. They go from A to B and in between we have inappropriate adult jokes in a supposed ""kids movie"". <br/><br/>Thats another point that bugged me. I really don't mind movies that are mindless and stupid because sometimes you really need that. I grew up with Tom and Jerry, Looney Tunes, Animaniacs and I agree, children sometimes just need slapstick and humor, instead of lectures all the time. Yet, do we really think it is funny to throw in minions in a thong, indicating a threesome in a whirlpool? Or that these cute, innocent, actually nice creatures want to do evil instead of good? Or do children really need to see grown up man, half naked, slapping each others asses? People who defend this don't seem to realize how big of an influence the minions became for small children. I see children running around with minion clothing and toys all the time. As a parent I would be ashamed to let my children watch something like that. <br/><br/>Interesting enough, for a kids movie, no child laughed at the ""funnier"" parts. The humor wasn't even that great and sometimes I was thinking ""Wait.....was that a joke? Am I supposed to laugh right now? I am confused."" I didn't get the soup joke (or was this a reference? or was that even a joke at all?) for example. The only clever jokes in my opinion where the Beatles reference and the moon landing but what kid would actually get that? <br/><br/>Yet, the weakest point is the story itself. For a movie that is about the minions past we don't really get to know these guys. Their journey to villain con was the only interesting part of the movie. Once they move to London everything gets mindless and incoherent. The writers seemed to have no idea what to do next with them (again, that's why they work a supporting characters, not as main heroes). <br/><br/>The writers seemed to be so unsure of their own product that we never get explanations for anything that happens: <br/><br/>Scarlet gets smashed by a chandelier and lives (seeing how long it took her to activate her shield/dress in a later scene I just have to assume it wasn't her armor protecting her). Kevin shrinks down again after the bomb instead of being killed. The queen honors the minions (for what exactly? They were the reason all the bad stuff happened in the first place) Why didn't they mess up with Gru like with all the other masters before? <br/><br/>I really wish I could love this more but there wasn't really anything for me to love and enjoy. Instead, I will be waiting for Inside out to finally air in Austrian theaters and hope that at least this one doesn't disappoint me too."
"Njkinny","9","6","10","12 August 2015"," Minions ~Fun, innocent and quite unique!
","We saw Minions for the first time in Despicable Me and the world fell in love with them including me. They are yellow, banana lovers and innocent like children. Seeking and taking happiness in even the smallest of gestures, their primary aim in life to serve a villainous boss but their luck is such that every time they think they have found their boss, something bad happens to him/her/it to leave them adrift again. They have had bosses ranging from T-Rex to the Egyptians to even the Yeti but still here they are adrift and still searching for a Villain to serve.<br/><br/>Here in the Minions movie, we are told their story of evolution and their journey of finding their final master, Gru who we saw in Despicable Me. <br/><br/>The plot of the movie is simple and yet it coaxed laughs, smiles and then huge sighs from me because I was bowled over by the minions and wished I could just take them home! The movie is loaded with the minion cuteness and their antics had me laughing every other second throughout the film. <br/><br/>Kevin is the serious one and the leader. Stuart just wants to be a famous musician and Bob is a baby who wants to get applauded and noticed. It was fun watching these three go out in search of a villain to serve. Their adventures as they come across Scarlet Overkill, the best villain of the time and then when she goes against them, how they save each other and also tackle Scarlet's cunning and deadly scientific devices was super fun to watch.<br/><br/>The 3D effects are few and mainly the movie has depth so I think there is little to no difference between the 2D and 3D versions.<br/><br/>All in all, Minions are adorable, funny, childishly innocent and super entertaining and so is the movie featuring them. It's laugh out loud fun, innocent in its scenarios and an entertaining watch. However, if you are looking for complex plots, breathtaking action and a mature movie then this one is not for you. It is made keeping children in mind and to really enjoy it you have to just go simple like you were as kids and soon, you'll find yourself living an adventure with the minions away from your life's problems and feeling like a kid again.<br/><br/>I absolutely loved Kevin, Stuart and Bob in the Minions movie and can re-watch this film again. I hope they make another one soon. Can't wait to meet them again!<br/><br/>After the movie, I just had to go and buy myself a ""Happy Meal"" with the guitar strumming Stuart as the complimentary toy, so I could at least take one minion home, if only in the form of a toy. :)<br/><br/>Go watch this movie, even if you don't have kids and enjoy a comedy very different and quite unique from the other movies. Minions movie gets two thumbs up from me!<br/><br/>This review is also available on Njkinny's World of Books & Stuff"
"ayoreinf","8","6","10","21 July 2015"," Slapstick at its best
","To remove all doubts, this is no masterpiece, no one making it pretends it is. This is simply a good fun movie that doesn't insult its viewers intellect. About 90 minutes of shameless slapstick, that's both clever and never resorts to vulgarity, even though some fart jokes do squeeze in. As far as I'm concerned this is as good as directing animation can get, considering the fact that one of the two directors does the minion's voices this means more than just technical knowhow and good control over the movie's pace. This is good comedy, and comedy as we all know ""is hard"". So don't underestimate some plain good fun and the absence of pretension is in my book one more big plus. Bottom line, for me, this is the best animation movie I've seen this year, tied with Big Hero 6, though it's considered 2014. I simply count the last 12 months."

","This movie is NOT for little kids! My 3 year old has seen Despicable Me 1 & 2 and both of these movies were not too much for someone his age in regards to violence, scare factor and intensity. Minions must have been written by sadistic people who don't have children because this movie is down right awful for so many reason. <br/><br/>Without going into too many spoilers, there is a scene in a torture chamber with attempted torture as well as a chainsaw wielding maniac and a scary clown. I couldn't stop thinking ""WTF were there writers thinking when they wrote this"" while watching this in the theater. I'm generally very liberal in my movie going experience and in general, but because of this movie I will never let my child watch a movie until one of the parents have screened it first. I can't believe this movie doesn't have a PG-13 rating. <br/><br/>I honestly can't think of any positive thing to say about this movie. Avoid at all cost."

","I really looked forward to see this movie, as the trailers alone were so funny. The movie was funny, and what I enjoyed most was the minion language, which was a nice mix of different languages (I heard French, Italian, English, etc).<br/><br/>Unfortunately (as I feared), almost all the plot was included in the trailers: the history of the minions, the three minions' journey, the arrival in New York, Villain-Con in Orlando, Scarlett Overkill, the stealing of the Queen's crown. There were some ""new"" twists in the end, but the first half of the movie was known and totally predictable. Taking away the surprise by including almost all the plot in the trailers is a good way to ruin the movie experience."

","Call us crazy, but we love the Minions, so much so that we aren't even a little mad that Gru's sidekicks from Despicable Me got their own film.<br/><br/>Since the dawn of time there have been itty-bitty yellow beings known as Minions looking for an evil villain to serve. After various wicked masters fail to liveup to expectations, Bob, Kevin and Stuart venture out into the world in the 1960s to find their most despicable master.<br/><br/>The Minions film is exactly what you would expect from these gibberish speaking quirky little fellows. And in that regard, there really isn't much to say. They get into crazy conundrums but their odd antics always end up working in their favor, somehow. There's plenty of silly humor to keep the kiddies giggling, but the jokes aren't completely idiotic so that adults might enjoy themselves as well. The plot does lose a lot of steam once the Minions encounter Scarlett Overkill and pursue villainous adventure in England.<br/><br/>I might be biased here because I've been speaking the exact same dialect of Minionese since before I even knew Minions existed, but I can totally get down with these crazy dudes. Not a break out hit like its 2010 predecessor, the third film of the franchise that delves into prequel territory is still surprisingly charming and funny enough to satisfy audiences.<br/><br/>Please check out our website for full reviews of all the recent releases."
"kieranbattams","7","11","22","28 June 2015"," Banana.. that is all.
","I, like everyone else, love the minions. Since Despicable Me was released they have become a global phenomenon, but what is it about them that is so appealing? After seeing this film i still can't quite put my finger on it, yet I want to see a lot more of these little yellow, pill shaped lunatics who love to punch each other. The appeal is mostly their humour, yet it is something we have seen before. Minions (sort of) explains their origins and where they originated from and makes a solid entry into the franchise that people just can't get enough of.<br/><br/>The story follows the Minions from the dawn of time. They were born to serve the biggest, baddest boss. But each boss they serve they end up killing somehow. Eventually the minions get depresses that there is nobody to serve. Kevin, Stuart and Bob take it upon themselves to go out and find their tribe a leader. After an encounter at Villain-Con they meet Scarlet Overkill (Sandra Bullock) and go on an adventure around London to steal the Queen's crown. Pretty simple, yet this movie ultimately felt bigger than the previous entries. Having no Gru in the film leaves mostly gibberish as the dialogue. Sandra Bullock does a fantastic job as the villainous Scarlet Overkill and i really enjoyed her stop-motion three little pigs story. <br/><br/>Jon Hamm, Michael Keaton and Steve Coogan also show up in roles that aren't really integral, but you can tell that each one of them has a lot of fun. At the end of it all though the Minions still keep this as their own movie and give us so many laughs. Some scenes in particular had me laughing a lot and with the humour being mostly visual this can be hard to do but is pulled off well here. One scene involving Stuart's hypno hat and some dancing tower guards had me in stitches and was easily the best part for me. Although one of the flaws i found was that whilst the film certainly feels bigger, some of it just feels unneeded and as if it were filler to make the film longer. With that being said, the film was a perfect length and i found that with Despicable Me 2 as well. It felt like the film was over within an hour, yet was still the longest in the franchise.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, this is the minions at their best and if you're one of the very few who doesn't like them then this will not convert you. If you are anybody else i guarantee you some fun with this film. Plus the soundtrack was surprisingly awesome. I give Minions a solid 7.5 out of 10 bananas."
"sweeeetmikey","10","5","8","16 September 2015"," couldn't get enough of this movie
","MINIONS review by: Mike Smith <br/><br/>For centuries of looking for the most despicable boss and coming up short, 3 Minions, Stuart, Kevin and Bob search for a new leader to bring joy to the rest of their tribe. After being recruited by super-villain Scarlett Overkill, Stuart, Kevin and Bob go off on an action packed adventure. <br/><br/>This maybe the best film in the trilogy. The story is fun, funny and action packed; the story never really has a sad point like most animated films and the story never has a dull moment. I laughed out loud throughout the whole film. <br/><br/>One thing that stands out in this film is that most of the dialog is the minions and most of the words are gibberish. But you don't need subtitles to understand what is go on because it plays like Pingu or Mr. Bean. Our two other main cast members are played by Sandra Bullock and Jon Hamm; they did an awesome job because not for one moment did I think of them as anyone else other than their characters. One set of characters I enjoyed in this film are played by Michael Keaton and Allison Janney who are a family of robbers; I'd like to see a spin off based on them. <br/><br/>The animation is great and Minions uses some different styles of animation, there is 3D animation which is throughout the whole film, some 2D animation and even a bit of stop motion animation. I think all of the different styles were all done by computers instead of the traditional ways for making stop motion and 2D, but it still looks great. <br/><br/>With action, comedy and all around fun; I had a grin from ear to ear, I couldn't stop laughing and I couldn't get enough of this movie. Great animation, great plot, great humor, what's not to love? Cheers and remember, life won't suck as long as there is a good movie to watch. <br/><br/>10 out of 10 <br/><br/>Edited by Samantha Locke<br/><br/>facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/FatMikesMovieReviews <br/><br/>Twitter: @FatMikeTPK"

"YoungCriticMovies","7","5","8","20 July 2015"," Minion$: The Prequel/Spin off Proves that Minions are Great as Supporting Characters Only
","Money over art --this is the undisputed law that Hollywood has churned up, and you can't blame them: who doesn't like money? Unfortunately the audience takes the toll when they are delivered disappointments. Something else that one sees throughout all of Hollywood is the inability to know when to stop. Minions proved to be the perfect showcase for these two ubiquitous aspects of Hollywood.<br/><br/>Minions is a prequel/spin off of the loved and critically acclaimed Despicable Me movies. In Minions we are told about the origin of Gru's (Steve Carrell) yellow, banana-loving helpers. The minions' objective in life is to serve the biggest and most evil villain of them all, so throughout history we see them serving (unsuccessfully) such figures like a T-Rex, a caveman, Count Dracula, and even Napoleon (I'm glad they didn't show the minions in the 40s). After decades of inactivity in the North Pole, three brave minions decide to set out and find a new master. These minions are Kevin, Bob, and Stuart, and they trek through all sorts of environments and finally reach 60s New York City, where they find out about Villain-Con where all of the world's villains will gather for an annual convention including the infamous Scalett Overkill (Sandra Bullock).<br/><br/>I have to say that the first half of the film had me mesmerized and laughing at the minions and their arguments in gibberish. I can't blame the studios for doing a minion spin-off, since the yellow characters completely stole the show in both Despicable Me films and they were a commercial hit. However, carrying a film out entirely on their own is much more of a challenge than brief sparks as supporting characters. And unfortunately the minions' humor burned out at the halfway point of the film. The story itself, which had been so sophisticated and surprisingly intricate up to that point suddenly took a turn and became a predictable childish lump. The humor started to go on a loop so that every joke was used at least four times by the time the film ended. And I think that this was such a problem because the filmmakers were trying to extend the runtime in order for this to be qualified a film and not a short.<br/><br/>However, I don't want to shame the filmmakers at all; it's hard to make a film where the main characters speak a mixture of gibberish, Spanish, Italian, French, and English. I actually admire the bold move of taking basically ""mute"" characters (in the sense that all their dialogue doesn't mean anything) and telling a story in a simple enough way that children can understand it.<br/><br/>But even so you cant help but feel that the second half of the film is extremely forced, so much that it takes down the entire film with it. And the ending is too fairytale-ish and ties all the loose ends a bit too conveniently. So overall the film is a bit of a let down, with a strong first half and weak second, but even so it's worth seeing the admirable work of the directors and writers by placing ""mute"" characters in their lead roles."

That's why it took my since opening day to write about it. The begging was really slow really just in my opinion just random stuff to fill in because they did not have enough story footage. I almost fell asleep during the begging because the first 29-30 minutes were as boring as heck, but I am glad I stayed up because it got a lot more interesting as it went. Some good things about this movie is that it focused mainly on the minions, it's nice that they choose them because they are really in the shadows in the first 2 movies. After the boring first 30 minutes they had a good storyline. Some bad things where that in the begging it had to much time to fill so they choose to peeling the boring mounts with minions. Also it took 30 minutes for me to get interested in the movie. If you take young kids to this they won't even notice the beginning."

","The Minions have tried over history to serve the most despicable. They always seem to end up causing their masters harm. After failing Napoleon, they are hounded to an isolated ice cave. They build an impressive settlement but over time, they lose heart without a villain master. Kevin has a plan to find a master with Stuart and little Bob. They arrive in 1968 NYC. They hitchhike to Villain-Con in Orlando, Florida and become followers of supervillain Scarlet Overkill. They travel to London where Scarlet instructs the trio to steal the Crown from Queen Elizabeth. Bob pulls the Sword out of the Stone and becomes the new ruler.<br/><br/>The Minions have always been the funniest characters in the Despicable Me franchise. I was confident that they could be hilarious in their own movie. This doesn't measure up to my expectations. I brought my little nephews (7 year olds) to the movie and they had a few big laughs. They liked it but not really loving it. For me, Minions is pretty funny at times but there is a missing element. Scarlet Overkill is evil without the comedy. After a pretty funny first half, the movie struggles for comedy which Scarlet is unwilling to provide. The middle gets kind of boring. It's not a movie for the adults. It is entertaining for the kids and in the end, that's what's important."
"Allen_The-Shep_Shepherd","6","5","8","10 July 2015"," Minions Review
","My Thoughts:<br/><br/>Where to start with Minions? This is a pure, kids movie, though they do try to add a few scenes in there for the adults to laugh at, and I will admit that I did chuckle at a few of the jokes. However, I think the one downfall for this movie is that we enjoyed the minions in Despicable Me because they were side characters and weren't the main focus. Now they are front and center, and yes, they are cute and adorable but really do not sustain a full-length movie.<br/><br/>For a group that is supposed to follow the biggest and baddest, evil boss out there, you really don't understand why they are so driven to do so. All of their actions make you look at them as sweet, innocent minions who really do not have an evil bone in their yellow bodies. The movie glosses over telling us why they are so driven to find the perfect evil boss and why they couldn't work for a superhero instead. Although, by the time of Despicable Me 2, they really are working for a hero instead of a villain.<br/><br/>Overall, I was not disappointed by this movie--it was cute and enjoyable--but I would not pay full price at the theater for it. The kids are going to love this, and it will most likely drive the parents crazy.<br/><br/>There are mid-credit and end-credit scenes. <br/><br/>My Recommendation:<br/><br/>Matinée It."

Since I did not get into the minions through the Despicable Me movies, I'm a late bloomer but definitely a fan now.<br/><br/>This was the first time I could actually hear real words that the minions spoke...too funny.

","Despite all of its criticism, I believe that Minions is not only a great movie, but the best movie of all time. The Godfather pales in comparison to this masterpiece. I also believe that Minions provides the most sex appeal out of any movie in the modern era due to its characters. Gru and Bob provide the sexiest moments in the film, and I believe that Bob's buttocks were just as close to breaking the internet as Kim Kardashian's were. This film displays the danger that the Minions had to do through in order to survive, and this film is the best documentary since March of the Penguins or whatever it was called. I now dress as a minion every night, and when I go to bed, I pray to Gru to protect my soul. I also follow an intense workout routine in order to have a butt like Bob, yet I know that I will never reach his level of thicccccccccccccness.

","So me and my movie theatre-working friend saw this today, a prequel to the first Despicable Me taking place 42 years before that one. Many amusing scenes and nice use of various '60s hits and other references to the era abounded. So I did enjoy this one somewhat. But, like the previous two, I did find it a bit cutesy for my tastes half the time I was watching this and also partly bored. One scene that was a nice surprise was the one where that family that picked up those three minions were revealed to be bank robbers. I also liked that slogan for the Nixon presidential campaign-""Finally, someone we can trust!"" Also liked that ""Make 'Em Laugh"" number done by all those other minions. But while I found some scenes funny enough, I never thought this was completely hilarious. Still, Minions is worth a look for animation fans and families."
"Cinema_Love","4","4","6","24 October 2015"," The most disappointing film of the year !
","I had high expectations with this one being a huge fan of the ''Despicable me'' saga. This one is truly not the film I expect. Sure the minions are cute, funny... for the 1/3 of the film... then it became another film with the pointless and not-funny at all human. The Minions stayed in some scenes but feel pointless or out of context most of the time. This film feels like it has been make for the big money. The storyline is boring. When the kids had fun for 30 min and then all of sudden it turn into a giant mess that some check their cellphones or other finally go to the bathroom break for that boring moment in the movie... but when they came back, it was still boring. I can not imagine someone accept this final script. Hope their will never be a sequel to this giant mess of a film. The minions are much cuter in the Despicable me films."

","Let's get this out of the way first: Minions is silly, nonsensical and completely designed as a marketing device to sell toys or other assorted merchandise bearing the goggled eyes of its childish leads. The story is mostly just an excuse to let the franchise's most popular asset run amok, and those searching for greater meaning are already on a fool's errand. Of course, there's still undeniable fun to be had by joining these little guys on a whirlwind adventure that spans the globe, and despite the fact that many of the plot developments are slapdash in their execution, the Minions encounter a number of laugh-out-loud moments that will have kids giggling uncontrollably even when their parents elicit only a chuckle or two.<br/><br/>For the full review, visit my site."

","I love the minions but this movie is so violent. A bank robbery, a crazy woman and a torture chamber. Come on you don't need to put that in a kids movie. My 4 and 5 year old were crying hysterically by the end of the movie. I was not laughing at all. I was bored and trying to keep my kids who were begging to leave calmed down. This was the worst follow up to the despicable me movie. Wish I had asked for my money back. I was so excited to see this movie because I was told Jon Hamm was really a funny character and at times he was but his character is also pretty much stupid and unnecessary. Sandra bullock having a kid of her own should be ashamed of giving her voice to such a violent character. The only part of going to see this movie that I actually enjoyed was the preview of another movie about what our pets do when we leave the house."
"lisafordeay","7","11","23","29 June 2015"," The funniest family movie of the year
","Yesterday my mom,my younger brother and myself all went to see Minions in 3D(this was my mom's first 3D film to see,as it was my 3rd having seen Avengers Age Of Ultron and Brave in 3D) as my little brother was dying to see this film and having watched and own both Despicable Me 1 and 2 I was looking forward to seeing it too.The story is told by Gregory Rush(Pirates Of The Caribbean) who is the narrator of the film and tells us how the minions evolved during the prehistoric times all the way to 1968 New York City. So the minions of course are on the lookout for a master as they are depressed and bored that they have no one to look after their species. So Kevin,Bob and Stuart travel to 1968 New York City and they find out that there is a Villain Con featuring a mastermind villianess named Scarlet Overkill(voiced by my all time favourite actress Sandra Bullock in her 2nd animated debut as her first was the 1998 classic The Prince Of Egypt)where she is on the look out for sidekicks to help her steal the Queen's crown(pretty much similar to the first Despicable Me movie with Gru wanting to steal the moon)so the minions get a ride to go to the Villain Con in Orlando,Florida with a family who happens to have stolen from the bank(the father is voiced by Micheal Keaton from my guilt pleasure movie Jack Frost,and his one of my favourite actors of all time too)and the minions finally get chosen later as Scarlet's sidekicks.So the minions team up with her and her mastermind husband Herb(voiced by Jon Hamm from Shrek 4 and Mad Men)and they help her get the Queen's crown. But could she be their new master or she is only using them to get what she wants?<br/><br/>Now let me tell you I loved the first two Despicable Me movies so i'm gonna tell you the good and the bad.<br/><br/>Good: The animation is very good and the voice acting is terrific like I have mentioned I love Sandra Bullock since the mid 1990's as she is my all time favourite actress and I have seen nearly every Bullock film she was ever in. Also there is a lot of laughs in this film that had me choking up with laughter especially when one of the minions wasn't allowed to go to see the Queen and the 3(Stuart,Bob and Stuart)disguised themselves as a woman and that just cracked me up as well as the beginning where we see the minions like tadpoles in the beginning and they were following a caveman behind and singing a Christmas carol. <br/><br/>Bad: For me I think this was a cash in so that more kids can buy more minion toys/merchandise and they don't even speak English its like there speaking polish or whatever as its all gibberish they say. Also the minions can get pretty irritating but its only on for an hour and 35 mins so its not that bad. Also I was a bit disappointed that Pharell Williams had no songs in the film as he was the one that made Despicable Me entertaining because the songs he wrote were so catchy like Fun,Fun,Fun,Happy(in Despicable Me 2) and of course the main them Despicable Me.<br/><br/>Verdict: If you loved the first two Despicable Me movies then you are going to love this movie. Overall I really liked this movie,it was funny ,entertaining and strictly for hardcore minion/Despicable Me fans only.<br/><br/>My mom's rating: 7/10 My brother:10/10 Me: 7/10<br/><br/>Spoilers ahead: Also Jennifer Saunders from Shrek 2 voices the Queen and at the end we see a young Gru(Steve Carell) steal the Queen's crown and the minions follow him in the end(and that is how they met up with Gru in the first place)."

"3xHCCH","6","7","13","11 July 2015"," Cute Alone Is Not Enough
","Since the first ""Despicable Me"" film (2010) and more in its 2013 sequel, those cute little yellow sidekicks constantly stole the thunder from under the lead character Gru. This was reminiscent of how the cute side characters like Puss N' Boots or the Penguins stole scenes in ""Shrek"" and ""Madagascar"" respectively, and got their own solo movies. It certainly was not a surprise that these Minions got their own solo project also.<br/><br/>This film was a prequel that spanned from the beginning of time on earth. Minions existed even before the first land creatures crawled out of the water. Since then, they would follow the most evil creature around like the T-Rex, probably for commensal reasons. Eventually they moved on to serving evil men, Dracula and Napoleon among them.<br/><br/>Because of their klutzy nature, they could not stay too long under one master. They all just retreated into their own snow-covered community, becoming very bored. So one day, a tall long-faced Minion named Kevin thought of venturing out to look for a master for them. For his quest, he had with him Stuart, a guitar-playing, single-eyed Minion and Bob, an adorably short Minion with mismatched-colored eyes and a teddy bear.<br/><br/>The trio trek all over the world, finding their way to Orlando, Florida in the year 1968 for Villain Con. There they meet the super-villainess Scarlet Overkill (voiced by Sandra Bullock), who just so happened to be looking for new henchmen. With hi-tech hippie age weaponry provided by her husband Herb (voiced by Jon Hamm), Scarlet sends the three Minions to steal Queen Elizabeth's crown for her. Will the Minions be able to pull off their big heist?<br/><br/>Despite some dips in the momentum, most of the film was action-packed and crazy fun. I especially liked the cultural references given the time period in the late 1968, as I am sure most adults will be. The Sydney Opera House under construction, the shows being shown on the black-and- white TV, the Abbey Road reference (although the crossing happened in 1969) -- I enjoyed these little tidbits of nostalgia the film provides. I also liked the musical soundtrack and how it complements the period when this film was set.<br/><br/>The story went in all directions in a rather scatterbrain way. It is also ironic and actually disturbing how a kiddie movie seemingly targeted for very young audiences had very dark and negative humor, like a bank robbery with kid accomplices or torturing Minions in a dungeon. That they made it look ""cute"" is not enough to erase the bad taste in the mouth. There were also some risqué humor in the mix. Really, having a Minion wear a thong?!<br/><br/>I did not really like the character of Scarlet Overkill too much with her over-hysterical personality. (Sandra Bullock's voice work was only at her best during her ""Bedtime Story"" scene.) Her husband Herb was a lot cooler, making him the more interesting villain. <br/><br/>All this prequel was riding on was the popularity of the cute yellow Minions. For me, they were hilarious as the sidekick of Gru in the ""Despicable Me"" films. Unfortunately, for the Minions to carry one whole film with cuteness alone does not cut it. Hearing their gibberish language for an entire hour and a half can be tiresome. In fact, I felt I was relieved to finally see the boy Gru at the end. (That is not really a spoiler, isn't it? You knew he would be in there somehow.) Gru and the Minions are a great comedy team TOGETHER, not apart. <br/><br/>The little kids around me were quiet most of the film, only laughing briefly during the slapstick scenes. When I discussed this film with my own kids after we watched it, they also expressed that they found the film underwhelming and disappointing as a whole. So I conclude that it was not only because of my age that I found it so. 6/10."
"shravansnot","Null","7","13","10 July 2015"," Trailer was as good as it got
","Totally agree with some of the reviews. If you watched the trailer, then you don't need to watch the movie. It was fun but not on par with what my expectation was. WHen they first introduced Scarlet, I was so excited. But she didn't have a very good role in the plot. She was neither clever nor witty. And a movie like this cant have a villain who is not witty. And the funniest part was the beginning 10 min and the credits where they show Gru and minions. Yes, this movie lacks soul and that is because Gru wasn't there. As soon as Gru was on screen, the movie became hilarious because of the chemistry between him and minions. Also because Gru is awesome. And cool. And more cool!"
"MattBrady099","5","7","13","29 June 2015"," Good for kids and for the family, but not for me
","My face while watching this movie (-_-)<br/><br/>The story is about the origins of the Minions, the little, yellow creatures have always attached themselves to the most ambitious, powerful super villain with one mission - serve them with all their might. But when the masters are killed, the Minions find themselves without a purpose and thus go into a self-imposed exile. After years, the Minions finally return and in the 60's attends a super villain conference where they hope to find a new master - and the first female super villain Scarlett Overkill seems to be the obvious choice.<br/><br/>Who the hell doesn't love those little yellow one eye or two eye minions. They made Despicable Me one and two watchable and stole the show for us. Minions have become a fan favorite and everybody couldn't get enough of them and now they got they very own stand alone movie starring them of course. I was looking forward to this movie, I mean the trailers looked funny and yes the real reason is for Minions. I thought a full feature movie starring them would be a blast to watch as in the Despicable Me movies they are good with they slap stick humor. Now after seeing the movie I'm a bit disappointed of what we got.<br/><br/>The movies animation is stunning as always. Universal Pictures and Illumination Entertainment never seem to disappoint me when it comes to animation and the little details with the model for the characters or just stuff in the background, they always look great and well made. I bet they animation will still look fantastic in the late future. <br/><br/>The Minions themselves are once again enjoyable to watch. They humor and slap stick are just the same in Despicable Me movies put I got a issue with the slap stick in the movie as the movie is focus on the Minions and they do they normal slap stick humor and it dose get a bit old and kind of stale after a while. In the Despicable Me movies the Minions only have a small screen time when it comes to they slap stick humor and it's funny all the time, but a full feature movie of all that got kind of old to me. It's was the same thing over and over again to the point where it wasn't funny anymore. You may like the slap stick humor for a full feature movie, but for me it got old really quick.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock as the villain of the movie was decent enough, but nothing really special. It wasn't terrible or anything amazing, it was on the level of okay. Sandra Bullock is a great actress and even when she's in a bad or okay movie she normally dose a great job in the movie and here she did the best she could and I give her that. Not one of her best but it's decent enough to let it pass.<br/><br/>This is a good movie for kids and for the whole family. It's cute, it's bright, colorful and enjoyable and I can see why some people may enjoy it. You may think I got a cold heart for giving this movie a rating like this and your right.<br/><br/>Overall this isn't a bad movie and yes you may look at the rating and straight away think it's awful, but really it's not bad but it's nowhere near good. I was looking forward to this movie as I thought this may be this years second best animated movie, but to me it sadly fell flat. But hey, who knows you may like it and yes I do say that a lot but it's true. I get lots of people who have seen my review and gone to see the movie and came back with a different opinion compared to my own. If you disagree with me that's fine, but at the end of the day I'm sticking of what I said."

","Long story short, the movie is about how the minions started out and came to work for Gru. For everyone who liked despicable me and were mildly disappointed by Despicable me 2, watch your expectations and emotions associated with the franchise go down the drain in the latest edition designed mainly to get you to buy more minion merchandise for your kids because they won't stop crying in the 'kids' aisle.<br/><br/>Remember the gibberish from the minions that you used to find cute in the movies that were mostly in English? Get ready to labor through 90 minutes of it while trying to understand a convoluted plot with the texture of swiss cheese, ignoring obvious plot holes and conveniences and trying to force out an 'awwwww' between gritted teeth as you try hard not to yawn or beat yourself up for wasting your money on this movie. The acting is hard to focus on because of all the other boring and predictable influences in the movie. Enjoy seeing the minions in adorably mortal peril knowing full well that they're going to make it, having seen them in the initial movies.<br/><br/>Plot: 1/10 Acting: who cares? Cuteness: 3/10 Comedy: worse than dad jokes Animation: what about it? Overall: 1/10<br/><br/>P.S. stay home, buy a minions plushie and burn the $6 you'll spend on the movie instead.

","I also have a high tolerance for bad but fun films. And kids' films. And films where one has to suspend reality and just jump in the deep end of silliness. But this is just 90 minutes of unrelenting awful. This film had such potential - the Despicable Me movies were fun romps, with character and emotion. This fails on all counts. There is no bonding with the characters, no real plot and so many inconsistencies and holes as to be cringeworthy. There's one decent fart joke 5 minutes in and then it's just plot less, racial stereotyping, unfunny, repetitive dross. I really wanted to like it, but if I hadn't had the kids with me I'd have walked out part-way through."
"adam-63492","1","14","32","1 July 2015"," Very disappointing considering all the merchandise made and expectations we had for this movie..
","I honestly don't write reviews very much but I felt like I had to for this one. Long story short, Illumination Studios MESSED UP real bad with this movie. We were all expecting some amazingly funny movie from the previous movies (despicable me 1 and 2), but maybe we were spoilt with the humor and quality so much that we were all just expecting too much for this movie. I mean it wasn't a train wreck, but the movie felt very forced and it just didn't have that magic to it that so many animations have these days. All of the jokes were pretty much shown in the trailer for this movie, and I don't really think the movie should have gone the way it had, it was Way too focused in London for some reason. This movie is completely different to despicable me despite still having the minions in it and I think this movie was only meant for kids this time despite previous movies still being entertaining for adults and teenagers. My advice is to not watch this unless you really can't find anything else to watch, most of the laughter is summed up in the trailer anyway I guess everyone makes mistakes lets all just hope despicable me 3 is good (if it ever gets produced after a failure like this that is....)"

","I was never a big fan of Despicable Me (haven't seen the second one) but Minions turning out so mediocre still disappointed me because the trailer promised a fun film that seemed to be a lot better than what we ended up having. The problem is a lack of engaging story-line, there were no real stakes to it. <br/><br/>At the start of the film I was fairly amused but by middle I felt bored. If there had been another protagonist to focus on maybe that would have made things better. Like say a character who can actually speak English and who we could root for because the Minions alone can't carry this film. It's now abundantly clear that they belong in the background.<br/><br/>Also there was nothing special about Scarlet Overkill. Gru at least was a distinctive character whereas Scarlet was the Strong Independent Woman that we have seen a million times before. So the film also failed in having a memorable villain.<br/><br/>So basically if you are an adult and you still have retained your love for animated films then there is nothing for you here. It has a few fun bits here and there but nothing to recommend it for."

",". . . seems to be the end of Kevin, as the MINIONS animators painstakingly recreate one of the most iconic images of the late 20th Century: the twisted mess of contrails splayed across the blue sky after the Jan. 28, 1986, Space Shuttle Challenger explosion. In Real Life, this disaster blew up Christa McAuliffe--the first Teacher in Space--and six others, but in the Animated Universe, Giganticized Minion Kevin not only survives HIS version of the Challenger Explosion, but is inexplicably reduced back to his proper (if diminutive) size. Not only are the contrails of the Challenger Disaster faithfully reproduced here, but also the pregnant pause among the crowd of equally horrified on-lookers desperately hoping it's all a bad dream for Kevin (as the Challenger viewers had once prayed). Since this flick comes from that premier House of Horror, Universal Studios, it would be disingenuous to criticize them for spoofing the Challenger Tragedy for their big cartoon climax. No doubt they'll wait another five or ten years to make an animated reference to the Twin Towers collapsing on 9-11."

","Expectations were high but movies was not.<br/><br/>Upon seeing the trailer I was very eager to experience the movie but it was a disappointment. These yellow creatures were expected to create hell lot of comedy and stomach aching laughter which seemed to be missing, except a single scene. Most of the comic scenes to be laughed upon were already showed in the trailer so if you have watched all the trailer you must not waste money for buying the ticket.<br/><br/>The basic story-line was told in the trailer only and the adorable gibberish of minions became a reason of irritation in some scenes. As far as narration is considered it is what they have shown in the movie, so no narration in the whole movie which makes some scenes confusing.<br/><br/>Though the movie had several witty comic scenes but none were that appalling to have made the viewer ROFL, even children didn't displayed much excited response. <br/><br/>As I said earlier the story-line was a disappointment though the movie started off very well and it was expected to be something different but all our hopes were shattered when the movie became a tail of bedtime story which has a villain that manipulate the heroes to get their work done and then betrays them.<br/><br/>The animation was way too awesome and was one of the best things about the movie. Also the 3-D was really appreciable. On comparing with Despicable Me series Minion has no stand. In this movie there was a lack of Gru who would complement the minions or it could be other way around.<br/><br/>So basically if you are a minion fan than you may find the movie awesome but if you are a Despicable Me fan than you won't have that big smile on your face when you'll be retreating the theaters."

","First of all, I'd like to start this review off on a positive note, and that note is Sandra Bullock as Scarlet Overkill, she was great as the lead villain! The first part of the film was pretty entertaining, telling the story of how the minions came to be, and how they came to America in 1968. The first about 30/40 minutes was very entertaining, but it seemed to kinda go downhill from there. It wasn't horrible, but it just wasn't nearly as good as the despicable me movies. I was a little disappointed by minions, mainly by comparing it to other movies. I'm not saying minions is bad, it really isn't, it's just definitely not as good as the despicable me movies, keep that in mind if/when u do see it. 6/10.

After watching the film, I thought it was even cuter than I expected! The plot is silly but fun. The minions are simple in design, and simple in their thoughts, but they manage to create the funniest situations. There are some jokes that made me laugh out loud, such as the usage of a teapot inside a police car. I also just realised that the minions are not talking unintelligible gibberish - it is actually a mix of languages, which I spotted Spanish, German, Mandarin and Bahasa.

","Despicable Me and Despicable Me 2 were adorable, cute, funny, and lovable, so I did something I almost never do--spent the money to catch this as soon as it came out, rather than waiting for the dollar theaters. It was a mistake. This was pathetic. The first 5 or 10 minutes and the last 5 minutes are the only truly funny parts of this seemingly 16-hour movie. I took my 10- and 7-year-olds; the only time they laughed were as mentioned. It gets 1 star for cute cultural references, which goes straight over the heads of the kids; even most parents of children that age don't recall the late 60's. It's not particularly cool when your kids are having to interrupt the movie to get an explanation of what's supposed to be funny.

","The MINIONS 3D computer-animated comedy movie begins from the dawn of time, with the relatively simple-minded MINIONS evolving from single-celled organisms, and then starting with the Jurassic Era becoming fiercely loyal beings who live just to serve history's most despicable masters. The forever-young goggles-wearing yellow henchmen, from the two delightful 'Despicable Me' children's' movies, now have starring roles in this latest film produced by Illumination Entertainment for Universal Pictures. Sandra Bullock finally gets the role of a lifetime as the nasty super-villain, 'Scarlett Overkill'.<br/><br/>'Scarlett Overkill' does mention the bard, and to quote William Shakespeare ""She vaunted 'mongst her minions t' other day"" (Henry VI Part 2). This retro 'Despicable Me' prequel is set during 1968 initially in New York and Orlando, with wonderful pop culture icons/references throughout. In the Swinging 60s London finale, Scarlett Overkill alongside her inventor husband Herb, wants to steal Queen Elizabeth's crown from the Tower of London. The trio of Minions – Stuart, Kevin and Bob pass the henchmen recruitment process at Villain-Com International. Scarlett Overkill gives the job to her new henchmen, the trio of Minions, KEVIN (the leader), STUART (the teenage rebel with his ukulele) and the diminutive and very lovable BOB carrying Tim his Teddy Bear, and is easily identifiable with his brown/green ""Heterochromia Iridum"". Via the bedtime story of THE THREE LITTLE PIGS, with ""Prokofiev's Peter and the Wolf"" on the soundtrack, Scarlet threatens to kill the minions if they fail to steal the crown. <br/><br/>Most of the Minions have a somewhat childish sense of humour, with overall personalities like the 'Raving Rabbids' of video game fame. When Bob pulls out Excalibur from Sword in the Stone, Queen Elizabeth is removed from the United Kingdom throne, and Bob is crowned 'King Bob' with ""Edward Elgar's Pomp and Circumstance March No.1 in D"" on the soundtrack, then Bob immediately abdicates to permit the coronation of Scarlett Overkill as Queen Scarlett.<br/><br/>Cleverly narrated by Geoffrey Rush, when the three minions visit Orlando Florida, three years before Walt Disney World opened, a young FELONIOUS GRU (Steve Carell) gives a brief cameo performance, with his mother MARLENA GRU. Rude humour and brief sexual innuendo, with classic slapstick comedy routines, are the prevailing themes, providing adult content that pre-teenagers will not understand – from putting her mammary glands back into her costume, to minions wearing tiny red thongs and tighty-whiteys, stylised queen waving, abbey road, yellow Beefeaters, yellow fire hydrants, yellow rubber ducky, the ocean liner France docked in New York, the adjective 'coronated' incorrectly used as a verb, Queen Elizabeth (Jennifer Saunders) is called 'La Cucaracha', inside Buckingham Palace playing polo on the backs of the Queen's Corgis.<br/><br/>Adults will easily recognise Sydney Opera House (under construction), Uluru, and the multitude of visual homages to Hollywood movies including – Singing In The Rain (Make 'em Laugh), Nosferatu, Creature From the Black Lagoon, Forbidden Planet, Back To The Future, Hair, The Flintstones.<br/><br/>There are deliberate visual mistakes for the year 1968, in the USA sequences such as - three phase electricity power-lines strung from power poles, green emergency exit signs. London still does not have red fire hydrants on its streets. <br/><br/>For young children there is the sound of flatulence, and many child-specific visual delights, such as the pet rat (pochi), dribbling, bananas, looking through y-front underpants.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, MINIONS director Pierre Coffin, voices all 899 minions, together with Chris Renaud. The minions provide easily understood visual cues, and as polygots do understand English. They only speak the minimalist minionese language, which includes precise food references, which do often sound almost exactly like English, French, Spanish, Malay, Indonesian, Hebrew, Japanese, Russian, Korean, Hindi, Italian, et cetera. You will hear many English words, such as 'banana', 'thank you', 'hello', 'no', 'this one', 'give it to me'.<br/><br/>The well-chosen music soundtrack features 1960s music icons including – KC & The Sunshine Band, Madness, Owl City, Aerosmith, Smashing Pumpkins, Bo Diddley, The Rolling Stones, The Turtles (Happy Together), The Who (My Generation), The Kinks (You Really Got Me), Donovan (Mellow Yellow), The Doors (Break On Through – To the Other Side), Rick Springfield (I've Done Everything for You), Jimmy Hendrix (Foxy Lady), songs by The Beatles including ""Got To Get You Into My Life"", however the lyrics are usually sung in the minionese language.<br/><br/>Please remember to stay for all of the end credits which finishes with superbly-rendered 3D appearances by most of the cast, whilst the minions sing 'Revolution' by The Beatles, and then plug the 'Despicable Me: Minion Mayhem' ride at Universal Studios, Orlando, Florida. Very entertaining 91 minutes, rated PG with mild animated violence, is quite suitable for all ages, but especially when experienced in a cinema, with an audience of constantly laughing teenagers and adults.<br/><br/>Voice Cast includes – Sandra Bullock, Jon Hamm, Allison Janney, Michael Keaton, Pierre Coffin, Chris Renaud, Jennifer Saunders, Geoffrey Rush, Steve Coogan, Steve Carell, Katy Mixon, Michael Beattie.<br/><br/>In Australian cinemas from 18th June 2015."

","Honestly, having seen the despicable me series of films I was expecting better. The funniest parts were within the first 5 minutes really, with very few laughs through the film. It is only one you would want to watch with your kids on a very dull day. OK the plot doesn't have to be sparkling for a kids film, but at least make it entertaining. Unfortunately this was an utterly predictable and dull plot with very little entertainment. Yes the characters are minions so really what are we expecting of them? But the whole point of minions is that there are a lot of them, this film only focuses on 3, which kind of limits the film.<br/><br/>Would I see it again....not in a million years, the minions are far more entertaining in despicable me, 90 minutes of them is torture."

","How incredibly disappointing after the enjoyable despicable movies. This plot seems like it was written by a rambling 3-year old drifting in and out of hallucinations. While there were a few funny bits, they were mostly in the trailer as others have noted. One of the most bizarre writing choices was to include innumerable pop- culture references from the 1960s! In the theater I was in, how can you expect kids to be able to relate to bizarre shout-outs to the musical ""Hair"" and to the famous ""Abbey Road"" crossing by the Beatles (Especially when you are supposed to pick up that reference from feet walking on a manhole cover with a white line on it as the only reference)....really weird. Outside of a few chuckles here and there, the crowded theater was virtually silent with a large sigh of relief when this disaster finally ended. Save your money and if you need something to do, watch the earlier movies again..."
"fraserinnesmitchell","4","11","25","30 June 2015"," Not the madcap movie I and others was expecting
","Minions was simply not entertaining enough for me. The premise was decent and well set-up with the back story simple but effective. However, from there, I felt the story didn't really find a purpose or an interesting enough direction - not that I expected anything incredible as it is, by rights, a kids movie. But there lies the problem. I went to a 3pm showing on a Saturday so plenty of kids there. There is a laugh out loud moment about 5 minutes in and everyone, kids and adults alike, enjoyed it with a lot of giggles from the kids. That's the last laugh I remember hearing from the kids. The entire audience was more or less quiet for the remainder of the movie. The only real highlight of the rest of the movie was the family who give the Minions a ride to the Villain fest you may have seen in the trailer.<br/><br/>The reason for this, in my opinion is that the film-makers relied heavily on what I think they deduced worked from the Despicable Me movies - silly voices and funny talking. Without other decent characters such as Gru and the sisters to bounce this off, these silly voices etc. got old quickly to the point where you felt the Studio genuinely was trying to milk the characters popularity. Couple this with a lack of the usual madcap antics you expect from Minions and the movie just didn't work. It felt like Illumination Entertainment (IE) had run out of ideas. I also felt, as great an actor that Geoffrey Rush is, he wasn't the right voice to narrate the movie (or didn't put on the right voice) - not the usual gravitas I expect from the Narrator of any movie.<br/><br/>To sum up, the movie had such great promise but didn't deliver for me or the friend who watched it with me. IE seem to have run out of ideas which is possibly understandable given all the game and shorts spin-offs that they have done since Despicable Me 2.<br/><br/>P.S. I almost feel like IE should have made the controversial move of hiring Johnny Knoxville et al to inject the madcap antics and situations that were so blatantly missing (child friendly of course!). Now that would have been interesting"

","I found this movie was really bad.<br/><br/>The whole of the movie is questionable from the start, but while sitting in the movie with my impressionable young children i had to wander what foolishness is going into their minds.<br/><br/>My 2 children 10 and 4 years respectively, didn't laugh or chuckle once during the film,but they did say they enjoyed it. I wanted to walkout of the theater 10 minutes into the film,but I had just shelled out £25, and I had taken my kids.<br/><br/>You get the history of the minions,followed by attempted torture and attempted murder (which happens a lot in kids films to be fair), but this just felt ghastly.<br/><br/>This film was given a 5 only because the kids did say they enjoyed it, but I can not think of anything nice to say about the film, and on my own it would have a 1/10!"
"shadowyx12","5","5","9","17 July 2015"," Yeah, sure - it's... it's good (ish).
","(There are spoilers for 'Despicable Me' and its sequel).<br/><br/>MOST kids will love this movie - there is no doubt about that in my mind. 'Minions' will provide them with plenty of cuteness, laughs, and a wacky adventure. You'd be doing your children a huge favour by taking them to this movie. The only kids who won't like this movie will be the ones who have gotten sick and tired of seeing the yellow critters everywhere.<br/><br/>Adults/teenagers who have fallen in love with the main characters will most likely enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>Now that I've gotten the obvious out of the way, I beg the question: Why do I (along with many others) think that this is by far the worst movie in the 'Despicable Me' franchise?<br/><br/>The answer is simple (at least, for me): this movie lacks heart - something that even its predecessors had. In 'Despicable Me', we see Gru and his three adopted daughters grow fonder of each other - up to the point where they accept each other as family. This relationship dynamic was what made the film so funny and memorable. In 'Despicable Me 2', Gru finds himself falling for Lucy Wilde and admits his feelings after a daring rescue attempt. It addresses the problem of the girls not having a mother, Gru being afraid of rejection and also lead to some pretty hilarious situations. In 'Minions', we have... the Minions constantly trying to fulfill their purpose in this world?<br/><br/>Although I will admit that I had my fair share of laughs while watching 'Minions', I just didn't have the same experience of watching the 'Despicable Me' films. Don't get me wrong - there are some great new characters introduced here (especially Scarlett Overkill), but they didn't seem that well-developed either.<br/><br/>While I can find myself watching both 'Despicable Me' films over and over again, I just won't be doing the same for 'Minions'. Besides, it's not a film to be taken THAT seriously, anyways."
"ThomasDrufke","6","5","9","10 July 2015"," Minion Overkill
","The first two Despicable Me films were such a surprise in both their humor and their heart. Minions looked to be one of the most entertaining films of the summer as it focused on everyone's favorite characters from the Despicable Me films. Unfortunately we were left with a mildly entertaining but overall forgettable film. But I also understand that as a 21 year old male, I'm not necessarily the target audience and so I can see the appeal that all the young kids and families will have. But I bought into all the trailers and was really excited to see the movie, it just turned out to be a big disappointment from my high expectations.<br/><br/>The worst part about giving this film a 6.2 is that the entire movie is pretty much shown in all the trailers. All of the great jokes, some of which I still laughed at in the film, were shown in the various 3 min long trailers we saw. I really do feel like if I would have stayed away from all the trailers I would have enjoyed the film a ton more and laughed hysterically like a lot of people did in my theater. But trailers aren't supposed to do that. It shouldn't be that we are forced to stay away from the teasers and clips so that we aren't spoiled for the film. Trailers are released to sell the movie, not spoil the movie. The various voice talent does a fine job but it was nothing memorable like Steve Carell's Gru. Sandra Bullock plays the main villain, Scarlett Overkill, but she isn't given a whole lot to do and in fact, the film just doesn't have much substance at all. Yes, it is still funny and entertaining to watch the Minions run around in madness, but there was something to be said about the story around the humans in the Despicable Me films. Minions were great in doses, but they were really missing that heart from the family storyline.<br/><br/>So with still quite a few laugh out loud moments, but no gut-busters, Minions failed to capture the magic madness that the other films did. But it is a fun time in the theaters with plenty of short funny scenes. It's just that at feature length, the film doesn't hit on all the levels that the trailers promised. It's more of just a shut your brain off kind of kids comedy, and I expected more.<br/><br/>+Creative gags <br/><br/>+Villain-con <br/><br/>+Voice cast does what they can <br/><br/>-Trailers give way too much away <br/><br/>-Not much substance <br/><br/>6.2/10"

","Despicable Me introduced the world to the impossibly cute yellow Tic Tac shaped sidekicks, with their help the film and its sequel became big hits, so it was only right that they were to get their own movie, this also serves as the prequel. Basically the small, yellow pill-shaped creatures, ""minions"", have existed since the dawn of time, evolving from single-celled yellow organisms into beings with only one purpose in life: to serve the most despicable of masters, they continue this throughout history. The only problem is, Minions have trouble staying with their chosen master, accidentally destroying them, these include a Tyrannosaurus Rex, a caveman, an Egyptian pharaoh, Dracula and Napoleon, so they isolate themselves from the world, starting a new life in Antarctica. By 1968 the lack of a master has driven most Minions to depression, so fearless Minion leader named Kevin plans to find one for his people, rebellious teenage Minion Stuart volunteers by accident to join, lovable little Minion Bob begs to join. After a long journey they reach New York City and learn about Villain-Con, a villain convention where supervillains from around the world gather to search for henchmen, held in Orlando, Florida, they hitch a ride with a family of criminals, coincidentally heading for the convention also. The Minions are impressed by many of the villains, but they rush to stage to impress the world's first female supervillain, Scarlett Overkill (Sandra Bullock), it is when she sets a challenge to find henchmen that Bob wins it for them, she recruits them, they join her and husband Herb (Jon Hamm), taking them to her residence in London, England. Scarlet gives the Minions their first despicable mission, she wants them to steal St Edward's Crown, the crown of Queen Elizabeth II (Jennifer Saunders), from the Tower of London, she threatens to execute them if they fail. The Minions successfully break into the Tower, but the crown has already been moved, they catch up to the crown and steal it from the Queen's carriage, destroying it in the process, but in the chaos Bob crash lands into the mythical Sword in the Stone, pulling out the sword Excalibur, the Queen is removed from the thrown, and Bob is the new King of the United Kingdom. Scarlet confronts the Minions for being traitors because they stole the crown without her command, but Bob abdicates and a process begins for her to become the new Queen, but she betrays them, locking them in the dungeon to be tortured by Herb, but their unusual shape and abilities mean that any medieval torture devices fail to work. Meanwhile, the rest of the Minions in Antarctica are getting both bored and concerned for Kevin, Stuart and Bob, so they leave their home and journey across the many countries and continents to find them, the three Minions in the dungeon manage to break out and want to apologise to Scarlet, at Westminster Abbey they accidentally interrupt her coronation, and cause a chandelier to fall and crush her before she can be crowned. Scarlet survives and orders the attendees to execute the Minions, Stuart and Bob are captured, while Kevin hides in a bar, where the Queen is now working, Kevin learns Stuart and Bob will be executed, so he breaks into Herb's laboratory, and triggers a machine which turns him into a giant and destroys the Overkill residence. Kevin rescues his companions, Scarlet becomes enraged by and tries to kill the Minions with missiles, but the army of Minions from Antarctica and giant Kevin distract her, the supervillain escapes with Herb using her rocket dress, but Kevin holds onto the rocket, causing it to explode, Kevin shrinks back to his original size. Elizabeth becomes Queen again, in front of a crowd she rewards Bob a tiny crown for his teddy bear, Stuart is given an electric guitar, but swaps it for a snow globe when he smashes the guitar, and Kevin is knighted. Scarlet suddenly appears still alive and with Herb snatches the crown, but they are stopped, being frozen in ice by a a young Felonious Gru (Steve Carell), taking the crown for himself and leaving with it, Bob gives Scarlet his little crown to Scarlet, the Minions see Gru as their new potential despicable boss and chase after him. Narrated by Geoffrey Rush, starring Pierre Coffin as The Minions, and also starring Michael Keaton as Walter Nelson, Allison Janney as Madge Nelson and Steve Coogan as Professor Flux and a Tower Guard. Bullock has fun voicing the maniacal but insecure villainess, Hamm gets some good laughs as her daft husband, supporting cast members do well also, this film lacks structure and a storyline you can be really involved with, and it is certainly not as great as the original film the title characters came from, but you get exactly what you expect, a good amount of laughs and great computer animation, something for all the family to enjoy, a fun animated comedy. Worth watching!"

We weren't to happy with the Penguins of Madagascar will this side kick outing be any different? <br/><br/>Kid's Korner rating: 2.25 stars Caroline's Rating: 3 stars<br/><br/>What do sidekicks need? A hero to follow. In the case of the Minions, they need a super-villain to lead this bulbous bunch. In the third film from the makers of Despicable Me, the story goes back to the beginning of time. From the inception of the world, the minions have been searching for a super-villain to serve. The little yellow creatures have been the indentured servants, comic relief and the downfall of villains throughout history from Tyrannosaurus Rex to Napoleon. Their existence is a innocently, parasitic search for the ultimate villain to serve. In a respite between leaders, they find a supposed Minion-topia where they find sanctuary. Yet, become listless and depressed without fulfilling their purpose in villainous service. During this dark time, three minions rise from within their yellow homogeneous existence and decide to go out to find a new leader. Kevin, Stuart and Bob travel to America in 1964 in their search and think they find her in Scarlet Overkill (Sandra Bullock), the self-proclaimed female super villain. She takes them on as her new villainous entourage and whisks them away to London to steal the crown and monarchy from Queen Elisabeth where things go bad quickly.<br/><br/>Entering the theatre where the median age seems to be five years old, there was a buzz about the new Minions adventure from Kyle Balda and Pierre Coffin. The Universal marketing team nailed their pre-school target audience. The Minion fan base was energised by excessive sugar intake and the anticipation of the little yellow men. From the Minion evolution to the indistinguishable dialogue and the pervasive slap stick humour, all parents would have to acknowledge that this will be the DVD on perpetual play in homes of toddlers throughout the world for years to come. It did not take too long to realise that this film was meant to capitalise on the popularity of the this citron gang, but unlike Despicable Me it did not have the same connection with parents. The original film was inventive and strangely endearing, providing as much for the parents as for the children. Minions does not meet the same standard. The storyline barely lifts itself above Saturday afternoon cartoons and the disjointed story only had appeal for the young ones. In Despicable Me, the transition of Gru from evil villain to a loving father of his lovable children provided something for the whole family to enjoy. In the first two films, the minions provided the story filler and comic relief, but in this outing they do not have the depth to carry their own film. Their farcical style quickly diminishes in drawing laughs and becomes tiresome after the initial sequence. There was hope in the inclusion of Sandra Bullock as Scarlet Overkill, but she never proves to be convincing as a super fem-fatale. In the tradition of capitalising on the marketing appeal of the plucky sidekicks Minions meets it's goal, but ultimately this canary-coloured tale is misguided and proves to be a weak outing for Illumination Entertainment. <br/><br/>Caroline's review: Dad asked me, 'Did I like the movie?' It was okay. The little boy sitting next to me really liked it and laughed throughout the whole movie, but his Mum kept looking at her mobile. Minions seemed like it was made for little kids. I did like it, but not as much as the first Despicable Me movie. I think I liked Minions more than Dad. I liked Inside Out much more than Minions.

","You either love or you hate Minions — there's no in-between, at least as of 2015. Back in 2010, they were fun little creations of animated preciousness, sure to make one laugh. But with the constant promotion that has surrounded them, especially in the face of 2013's ""Despicable Me 2"" and this year's ""Minions"", we've come to a point where you still want to purchase a stuffed, voiceless figurine, or you want to throw darts at a picture of their likeness.<br/><br/>I've always loved them — not in the same way the kids ten and under do, though — but this second sequel to ""Despicable Me"" (though technically a prequel), while delightful, hardly convinces that these foot-high giggle mavens really need a standalone movie. A backstory for a superhero I can handle; but considering I never found myself curious as to whether these yellow nuggets always worked for Gru, ""Minions"" feels rather needless. Charmingly needless. But needless all the same.<br/><br/>Beginning as if it were an Animal Planet special, the story of the Minions is narrated by a voice akin to David Attenborough, all knowing and invested in his subjects. Minions, it seems, are immortal; they began as single-celled organisms and evolved over the years, finding their niche around the Dinosaur era. Nothing has ever changed in their life goals, however — finding and serving an evil master is what they've been brought on this Earth to do. They repeat the same tasks over and over again for centuries, loving every minute of it. But after the Ice Age overtakes the atmosphere, they find themselves without a villain to worship. So they become isolated, lonely. Their easygoing cheer withers away.<br/><br/>That all changes come 1968, when they decide it's finally time for a change after years of boring nothingness. Three of the community members, Kevin, Bob, and Stuart (all voiced by director Pierre Coffin) go out on a limb and sail to New York City, where they run into several obstacles and inadvertently hear about Villain Con, a top secret convention in Orlando in which all the world's most devilish foes get together and have some sinister fun. At its head is Scarlet Overkill (Sandra Bullock), a legendary baddie looking for a new set of henchmen. You can see where this is going. With three Minions in tow, Scarlet tasks them with the impossible — steal the Queen of England's crown. Then — then — they will become official sidekicks. <br/><br/>Whereas ""Despicable Me"" and its sequel were laugh-out-loud funny, ""Minions"" is mostly cutesy, gut-busters few and far-between. This isn't a huge problem — the film is always entertaining — but likability only goes so far before we begin to realize that things aren't as original as they were before. The comic situations are still disaster laden, the animation is still deliciously caricaturish, and the voice-over work is still zany (Bullock is a great addition). Nothing has changed; only the freshness has. It's carefree family entertainment, ready to please the children. Just don't expect to remember it a second after you leave the theater."

","""Minions"", the spin-off everyone has been waiting for! Over the years, we've grown to be very fond of those yellow pesky yet lovable Minions who speak Gibberish and are very well-known for their carefree and silly antics. This time, they finally get to become the main stars of a 90-minute feature and honestly, they delivered what they were known for, their carefree and silly antics, and nothing else. <br/><br/>""Minions"" starts out with an overview of the origin of the Minions (sort of). It explains that they are creatures whose purpose is to serve the baddest villain. But they always have hard time keeping their masters since their efforts to help them always unintentionally leads their masters to a not-so-good fate. The failure to find a master leads them to a depression and one Minion (Kevin?) decides to bring some of his friends along to find a new villain to serve, that is Scarlet Overkill (voiced by Sandra Bullock). <br/><br/>The movie itself is quite fun. It has plenty of laughs, and even if the majority of the laughs are slapstick comedy, the Gibberish spoken by the Minions are always something to giggle on. They do silly stuff. Their interactions with humans are fascinating and funny. They run into ridiculously impossible situations yet somehow manage a way to find solve it. It's hilarious. The gadgets are visually dazzling and cool to look at, but everything else was a bit lacking. <br/><br/>This spin-off lacks the incredibly likable human characters its predecessors had. No Gru. No Agnes. It substitutes them with a couple consisting of Scarlet Overkill (Sandra Bullock) and her husband Herb (Jon Hamm). They do not resonate with us as Gru and the three girls did with us in the previous two films. The signature Gru accent is absent. The awkwardness of Gru trying to become a good dad is absent. The vibrant and distinct personalities of the three girls are absent. But rather than replacing them with other rich characters, we just get a female super villain who's really just a control freak or a megalomaniac, with a husband who simply just supports her along the way. I can't help but feel that they are just dull as compared to what we were offered previously. (There's also one random villain family but they're also plain.) <br/><br/>Ultimately, the lack of dynamic human characters causes this spin- off to not be able to achieve what I really loved about the first two films besides the Minions, that is the ability to have touching moments. In the first film, there was an arc when Gru started to actually open his heart to the girls, and when he started to gradually become kinder and more giving. The scene in space where he finally shrunk the Moon, but realized that he was on the verge of missing the girls' recital. The bonding between the girls and Gru. In the second film, there was this scene where Gru felt depressed after Lucy was relocated somewhere else, where he just sat outside his home alone in the rain. Agnes comes and the two have a chat. <br/><br/>In the end, it's a lighthearted comedy and it's enjoyable. Kids will undoubtedly devour it and will glee at the sight of those yellow Minions. But for those who expect something more than just rampage and silly antics, well this movie doesn't offer to you that much. It reinforces the popularity of the Minions but it's quite a shame that this movie could have been done with more thought and heart, but ultimately chose not to pursue it."

","The movie starts with a narration about the minions, how they have existed since long ago, seeking the most evil entity to serve. The change from master to master due to often it's them who cause their master's demise. One day they find themselves isolated in an ice cavern and thrive as a tribe. But as time passes they lose spirit in living because they don't have a master. A minion Kevin decides to go to the outside world to find a master. He gets Stuart and Bob as his companions. They arrive at New York and after some time wandering around they found a secret villain TV channel that announces the Villain Con in Orlando. Hitching a ride with the Nelsons, who turn out to be villains also, the minions reach Villain Con. There they see Scarlet Overkill, then the world's most notorious villain, who turns out to be seeking for a henchman. Bob accidentally wins the contest to become Scarlet's henchman. <br/><br/>The minions follow Scarlet to her castle and Kevin phones his fellow minions to come. She tasks the minions to steal the royal crown from Queen Elizabeth of Britain. With gadgets from Scarlet's husband Herb, the minions succeed in stealing the crown but get caught red handed so they run from capture, until Bob accidentally releases the sword in the stone from the Excalibur legends. Thus Bob is crowned king. Scarlet is infuriated by this and visits the minions. They instead happily give the crown and the kingship to Scarlet. But Scarlet instead sends them to a torture chamber. But somehow the minions can't be killed by the torture equipments and they sneak back into Scarlet's coronation ceremony to apologize. But again their will don't as well as their deeds, as instead the crash an ancient chandelier onto Scarlet's head. Scarlet sends the other villains from Villain Con after the minions. Stuart and Bob get captured. <br/><br/>Kevin escapes and stumbles into Herb's secret weapon, which transforms him into a gigantic minion. He saves Stuart and Bob while battling Scarlet, while the rest of the minions arrive. Kevin swallows Scarlet's rocket but prevents her to escape, blowing her up and returning Kevin to his size. Kevin, Stuart and Bob are rewarded by the Queen. But Scarlet returns and steals the crown, only to be stopped by young Gru, who takes the crown and gains the minions as his servants.<br/><br/>The story feels like just another children's animation, a group of kids or youngsters going on an adventure to help their community. The thing is, even the most basic concept of the movie is actually a perverted version of a good story for children. In this movie we find the actual purpose of the adventure is to find the most evil entity to serve, which is not the thing one would teach his/her kids.<br/><br/>It then becomes obvious of how the movie gains interest through those publicity linking the franchise with the Illuminati. For me it's even funnier since all those signs appeared long before sine Disney animations. The thing is those who link the movie to Illuminati had already been exposed to the subliminal works altogether that it rang a bell in their minds and triggered them to publish. For me the movie is just another entertainment, for readied minds, mind you. I think it's okay to take kids to see the movie, but as soon as they start their school years, parents should really start to teach them to beware of those subliminals.<br/><br/>Back to the movie, I really like how the script retains the overall crazy attitude of the minions. All those goofy stuff are really funny indeed, that it will crack your laugh as soon as the movie picks up it's narration. The thing is many of the movie's comedies has been badly spoiled by those many trailers dated from as early as last December. And the funny stuff that's not in the trailers couldn't really top those which are.<br/><br/>Well Minions (2015) deserves a meager 7 out of 10 score from me, and a recommendation. A guaranteed laugh throughout is what you'll get throughout this movie. Thus this movie isn't really just for kids as the comedies appeal more to grown ups."

","If I could wash this movie out of my daughter's memory, I would! It was not just scary, it was inappropriate. The attempt at humor didn't work because it was so dark. The Despicable Me movies had some adult humor but they were light and not offensive or scary to younger children. We hoped it would get better as we watched Minions, but it only got worse as the graphic and unnecessary violence continued. There isn't even a redeeming message or something positive. We got our money back, but I suggest you don't waste your time. Parents, this is not a kid movie. It actually made my eight year old daughter feel sick as she watched it - and she was dressed up as a minion, so excited to watch the film. And it made me uncomfortable that I had exposed her to it. Huge disappointment!"
"RemusGrey","2","9","21","12 July 2015"," OMG! The theme is evil!
","Minions is just like a much worse version of Despicable Me. It shows that being evil is cool for kids. Kids will follow that since everything done in movies are being copied by children. Despicable Me was a great movie, with a heart. This one, however, lacked heart. The humor is inappropriate and dark. I was expecting everyone in the theater to laugh, but only few people laughed and few laughs were present in the right funny scenes. During the dark comedic scenes, nobody laughed. It's not for kids anymore! Some dark humor like a whole family robbing a bank (I hate that part. I wanted to like it because a Beatles' song was playing, but it's not funny! Nobody in the cinema even laughed at that scene.), hypnotizing guards and making them take off their clothes and dance, pushing a girl in the escalator, dethroning Queen Elizabeth, etc. And the theme is evil! The first Despicable Me movie was evil, but not fully! It ended with a positive ending. How about this one? Nope, it didn't lose the evilness at the end (though it was epic with Gru's appearance). Other than the inappropriate humor, there are some that are still funny. Some of the minion's humor are funny and are better than the inappropriate humor, but most remain unfunny.<br/><br/>One thing I don't get with the others is that they hated watching a movie with mostly gibberish language from the minions. Can't they understand that this movie focuses on the origin of gibberish speaking minions? I don't need subtitles, some are translated by a narrator and some are easy to understand even though it is gibberish. The songs used in the movie were perfect. Hearing the classic songs make me feel like I am listening to Awesome Mix Vol. 2 (from Guardians of the Galaxy). I was happy that the Beatles' song was played in the movie (I'm not sure if it was really them stepping on the minions because I thought the Beatles had a cameo). Now for the voice acting. Pierre Coffin was OK in speaking gibberish, but he can't beat Chris Renaud's minion speaking. Sandra Bullock was just OK in voice acting, not that impressive. I didn't really like her character either as it represents Satan. Michael Keaton, even though I hate his character, was as good as his Birdman role even though it was voice acting. Jon Hamm was much better than Sandra Bullock's villain voice acting. <br/><br/>Minions lacks heart, it has an evil theme, and inappropriate humor, and is a terrible origin story about the minions. Minions serving the baddest villain? Evolution? (I am a Christian, so forgive me for that) The film's tone is really evil. It's not as fun as the first two Despicable Me movies were. Don't add this to your Despicable Me collection since it is a really evil film. Not worth the money or your time. Go watch the first two Despicable Me movies and if that idea isn't good, hug Baymax instead of minions. I'm sorry if this hurts so much, but the minions represent demons and servants of Satan. If you are a Christian, don't watch this. That's why I said ""Hug Baymax"" instead of minions. I really regret watching this movie that teaches being evil is cool. Spend your moeny on Inside Out instead. While it is too complex for children to understand, it has a good influence and teaches that too much of everything is bad and life is not all about happiness, which is why sometimes it is fine to feel a negative emotion. What about Minions? Evil is cool! Be a criminal so that you will be better than everyone. Not a good influence, right?<br/><br/>1/10 +1 for Beatles scene. 2/10"

I was quite disappointed that there was no Gru until the end and even then, he was a child with a voice too old for his age and even Tina's voice doesn't fit the kid very well.<br/><br/>The characters in there are basically annoying, even Scarlett, who was pretty likable until the film's final.<br/><br/>The film is cute and somewhat funny, but not as funny as the Despicable Me movies and is also really boring for the most part."

","If the Minions can't succeed at speaking English how can there be a full movie about them. This is what really bothers me. Even if their taught English they refuse to understand. I know it's supposed to be for Comedy, but I still think it's unnecessary to make a movie about the Minions you want them to speak English. I'm not good at long posts, since I'm more used to the 500 character limit YouTube used to have, But the minimum on here is 10 lines. So yeah, the minions don't need a full movie unless they can speak English. I know I said it many times in this post, but at least I had a reason to say it.

And while I may appear to be ranting, that is an artifact of text reviews. I am very calm and objective when I am reporting that watching this is a waste of time for anyone that has lived more than 5 years.<br/><br/>Bottom line: Sandra Bullock, John Hamm, Michael Keaton, Geoffrey Rush and Hiroyuki Sanada were actors for this nothing of a movie.

"Barbouzes","Null","3","5","23 July 2015"," Loved it!
","People, I have never seen Despicable 1 nor Despicable 2: I don't watch children movies. I did not even know who Gru or the minions were before I saw the Minions' trailer -while attending another movie in the theater. But somehow that Minions trailer got my attention and did not leave me for a week: I simply had to see this cartoon that created such an original language for its protagonists. A linguistic grab from the get-go. I grabbed 3 friends with a sense of humor -we are all mature adults- and off we went to see Minions. We loved it! <br/><br/>My personal take? MINIONS is not a children's film: it is way too good for kids! To start with, it is sprinkled with cultural references from Mozart' s Magic Flute to Prokofiev to the Beatles to the Monkees to the Who to Napoleon to Godzilla to James Bond to 60s politics and more. I am very sure the viewers who claim they were not entertained by this movie failed to notice the amazing level of culture placement, high and low, packed in that tiny plot. Pretty remarkable for a children's cartoon. Hey, a children's movie that does not bore the parents out of their gourd? Banana! Yes, the plot is silly, but the script is clever. Take the reference to the ""fake US lunar landing"" every USSR citizen grew up with, for instance: it zips by for a micro second, but what a zest that mini scene packs. The ""Papagena"" pick-up line by Bob to a fire hydrant in New York? What a beauty of a cultural mash up! <br/><br/>But to me the hilarity palm goes first to the crazy linguistics of the 3 minions' speech. The 3 minions speak gibberish, but with such Esperanto gusto that all viewers understand what they mean. A difficult premise to start a film, but a gambit that works here against all odds. I don't know who the makers of this Minions cartoon are, but I think there is genius to their madness. <br/><br/>The choice of soundtrack music was fun, the action was never flagging, the visuals were pleasant and often spectacular. No kidding: that movie was sweet candy to our ears and eyes, and, banana!, to our brains as well."
"jhamjohnston","6","3","5","19 July 2015"," Adults wishing they could have plugged the kids in at home
","The movie had a couple of laughs for the adults, but was kind of a mindless bore for most of it. It seems best suited for kids 4-8 years old. I'm a fan of the first two movies and love the minions but could not get into this one. They probably just don't have enough substance on their own to fill the time for a full length feature. At least now we understand the origin of the species. The kids seemed to enjoy themselves. The 3D aspect was OK with a couple of nice things poking out of the screen, but lacked in overall depth perception. Not really worth the extra money in my opinion to see the 3D. Recommend watching this one at home."
"adamrocks-37982","6","3","5","19 July 2015"," The Perfect Example of Using All of the Movie's Energy at Once Rather than Building it Up.
","As a person that thought that liked the first two Despicable Me movies a lot, I thought it had something special about them. It had the villain named Gru who had a special love and care for the three orphan girls. However, the funniest thing about the movie was the minions that bring a lot of laughs that come in small doses. Now, the directors of Despicable Me take the minions into the lead role in their own movie and the result is a fun, uneven movie set in the 60's. Before Gru, the Minions were looking for a villain. They tried and failed so many times with a different villain. Now, the three minions under the names of Kevin, Stuart, and Bob must find a new villain where they face a lot of obstacles in their way. The First act was clever and superbly written as it shows life of the yellow creatures from the beginning of time to the 1900's with a cunning voice by Geoffrey Rush as the narrator. The second act got a bit more routine after they introduced Scarlet Overkill and set foot in London. The third act, however, got very out of control as too many things were all at once. Pierre Coffin does the voices for the minions which gave me all the laughs I could get and probably could. Scarlet Overkill's character (Sandra Bullock), however, was tediously developed although Sandra did a good job of voicing her. I don't want to spoil the rest of the cast but Scarlet's husband (Joe Hamm) was cunning and witty as Hamm does a wonderful voice-over by him. The rest, however, are a mixed bag. While the animation isn't as good as Inside Out, Illumination Studios still does a great job of lighting everything and make great use of the textures. One fine example of this was Scarlet Overkill. When they showed her at the Villain-Con, her hair was bright and her dress was sleek. That was some of the best animation Illumination has ever done along with the water. There was also a mid-film bedtime story where the stop motion was so-so. The best animation was at the beginning where it was superbly hand-drawn where it showed the minions that were under the sea. While I laughed a lot at the minions from the beginning, I also fell half asleep as the movie continued on when they were at London. I just felt like they were too much for those yellow dudes. It almost felt like they completely run out of energy by the end of the movie. Another thing is that when there was two moments when some people were just in their underwear, it completely offended me and I had to look away. I think that they were preparing kids for PG-13/R rated movies. However, the beginning and the end were the best parts. What made the beginning and the end so fun was that it was clearly narrated and in the end, they introduced young Gru. Honestly, the selection of 60's songs were a nice return being a fan of 60's music. That means that they have tracks from The Kinks, The Who, and The Beatles and most of the 60's songs work well on scenes especially the chaos for queen's crown works out very well with the song of ""You Really Got Me"". All in all, I thought Minions didn't reach the efforts of the Despicable Me movies. While Minions has laughter, colorful animation, some nice characters and song selections. Minions also has an uneven plot, some undeveloped characters, and things that may offend caring moms. To have a full satisfying experience, watch the end credits where you will get laughs with the minions and Gru. Call me a Gru fan but I really liked it more when the minions were with Gru the villain. ""C+"""
"kgprophet","5","3","5","17 July 2015"," OK Summer Air Conditioned Fun
","I had a choice of seeing ""Ant Man"" or this light fare when deciding on a movie. As much as Ant Man is being lauded as good craftsmanship, I am getting a little fatigued on Super Hero movies. Yes, Ant Man is not a sequel, but I grow tired of the same origin story, the same kind of villain, etc. My decision to see Minions was based upon the idea of watching something diverting with perhaps some originality. <br/><br/>I had a grudgingly agreeable time with the Despicable Me movies, partially because they were a little more risqué. The minions were obvious a comic relief for young children, as they constantly were doing physical gags. One reviewer likened ""Minions"" to a Looney Tunes cartoon, for which I have a fond regard from childhood. So perhaps I thought this big budget outing of the little side characters could have some inventive sight gags. Looney Tunes was created for adults back in the day, Minions is aimed almost strictly at the kids. <br/><br/>The biggest letdown was how lame the villain was. Another thing perhaps worth mentioning is the majority of the film consists of gibberish dialogue that has no captioning. This prevented me from getting that connected with the three main minion characters. In general, the adventures the three minions go through was not driven with much purpose. Yes, there is the overarching story of the minions looking for a new villain to serve, but almost the entire film consists a series of set pieces (like a visit to a department store, with the retched 'clothing montage') that do not advance the story at all. The hyped up ""Scarlet Overkill"" is just an empty shell of a character compared to Steve Carell's inspired Gru. This is more than obvious when a young Gru appears as part of the closing credits, and I find myself laughing and getting far more excited about these few sight gags than I did for the entire film.<br/><br/>Laughs were few for me, although the crowd of kids in attendance were laughing quite a bit. The lack of laughs came from; uninspired villain, main characters that were too superficial to care about, and set pieces that provided too little bang for the buck. I think it is obvious that this was meant to be a lighter and fluffier animated film, not meant to evoke Pixar (like the movie ""Planes"" never tried to be a Pixar caliber film). So for me it comes down to whether the brisk pacing and short running time is your best bet for sitting in some air conditioning on a hot summer day. If you're tired of yet another super hero movie, the answer is a not so enthusiastic yes."

The Minions sole purpose in life is to please every evil villain they run into, and they enjoy doing it all the way. Whether it is robbing banks, killing cops, enemies and innocent bystanders, everything is being done with joy. I just can not comprehend how film makers can make a kids movie that contains 100 minutes in which evil is being glorified. In a scurvy, lighthearted fashion, it sends a message to young sensitive minds that doing bad and being evil is cool and fun.

It was obvious that it was made to appeal more to trailer-trash adults than it was for kids. The plot was predictable, the jokes were stupid, crass and annoying, and the animation was just another load of cheap CGI garbage. I had to go see it with my family and the theater was full of children. The adults were laughing like morons, some were gushing on about how cute the minions were (god help us all), but not a single child in the theater even cracked a smile. A few children said ""ew"", some bored teens sat in the back texting, some people got up and left about halfway through the film, and many children left to go to the bathroom and didn't come back until the film was over.<br/><br/>This film was a pathetic waste of time, effort and money, hands-down.

","""Work for me, and all this will be yours: respect, power, andBanana""<br/><br/>Young children will absolutely fall in love with the lovely and insane minions, the humor, and the colorful animation, but unfortunately adults will find their wacky antics to wear off quickly as they become repetitive and tedious. At least that was my experience with this film which I ended up mildly enjoying. It did succeed in keeping the kids completely entertained, unlike with Inside Out where most of the younger kids began to get distracted and run around the movie theater. However it takes animated films like this to really appreciate what Pixar did with the insightful and original Inside Out. Pierre Coffin who co-directed both Despicable Me films with Chris Renaud, now teams up with Kyle Balda (who directed The Lorax with Renaud) for this spin off centering on the colorful characters who were the highlight of the Despicable Me franchise. It's hard to resist their cute antics and for that reason most of the jokes work in this film, but there isn't anything else to the familiar slapstick humor. Coffin is the true hero here as he not only directs, but voices all of the minions and no matter how many times you hear them say ""banana"" it is funny every time. As uneven as the film might be, there are a number of memorable scenes that will stick with you and help you endure the 90 minute runtime. Unfortunately the funniest scenes are all included in the trailers, but it is still a fun ride nonetheless.<br/><br/>The plot centers on the origins of the Minions who have evolved through the dawn of time and have always followed the most despicable masters (including the Tyrannosaurus Rex, Dracula, and Napoleon). Ironically they are always the cause for their masters's demise (which can be seen in the trailers). With no master left to follow, the Minions settle in a cave and struggle with depression for decades, until one of them, Kevin, decides to go in search of an evil boss. Along with Bob and Stuart, the trio embark on a journey to America in 1968 where they encounter Scarlet Overkill (voiced by Sandra Bullock) and her inventor husband Herb (Jon Hamm) who are the world's most despicable villains. Scarlett offers them the opportunity to work for her if they manage to steal the Queen of England's crown. Kevin, Bob, and Stuart accept the mission with the intention of saving the fate of their brothers and finally being able to serve a worthy master. <br/><br/>There is no doubt that Minions will be a financial success and it will attract young audiences to the movies. Adults will be glad their children will be distracted for a couple of hours and everyone will return home happy. Other than entertaining your kids for a few hours, Minions doesn't have anything new to offer. There will be plenty of laughs and the characters will sell a lot of toys, but there is nothing else to it. I still had a better time with this film than I did with Home, which surprisingly had done very well in the box office, but neither of these films come close to the emotional appeal of more intelligently crafted animated films such as Inside Out, which continues to prove that the rest of the animation studios are far behind from producing the quality that Pixar brings to their projects. <br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"

Just look at the fact how their invented language works and how they used so many languages to construct ""Minionese"". Beautiful. The paradox between the good, sweet and bad was the main wheel from the first movie, and they kept it in this one. So many details (just look trivia section) shows me that this was not either fast or superficial artwork. And my favorite is the Queen. Shown not as she probably is, but what she's supposed to be - kind, good to people, a true leader. Only thing that was not so great is a choice of music. Yes, it's obvious - it's late sixties early seventies, but in my opinion they could put more effort to it regarding to everything else. Conclusion - see it for yourself. If you are forever child like me, you will like it."

","""Minions"" has many amusing moments and the animation is simply amazing. The textures of intricately woven curtains, hair/fur and spittle are amazing, as is the elastic quality of skin and other surfaces and the ability to change perspective while maintaining an astounding level of detail. It's fun to watch simply to see how far animation has advanced since ""Steamboat Willie."" <br/><br/>However, it is not nearly as much fun to watch as the Despicable Me movies for a number of reasons. <br/><br/>The notion that the minions are motivated by a desire to submit themselves to mindless servitude to the most evil villain makes them less sympathetic and seems contrary to some of their actions, particularly when they oppose those villains. It's much better to think of them as innocent, fun-loving, mischievous characters whom Gru is able to manage and motivate through his charisma and by rewarding them with silly things. <br/><br/>The idea that the minions are basically immortal and have survived for eons allows the filmmakers to put them into amusing historical situations without addressing the question of how they reproduce. However, it (a) stretches credulity beyond the snapping point; (b) eliminates/undermines the infatuations that were so charming in the DM movies; and (c) lessens dramatic tension, as it's difficult to imagine they can ever be killed after surviving dinosaurs and eons of wars and pestilence. <br/><br/>Gru's plot to steal the moon was ridiculous, but within the cosmos of reality established for the film. The audience simply accepts it and moves on, even though the rational mind would reject the idea. The theft of the pyramid was the same sort of thing, the theft of a massive, immovable object. Minions creates new wrinkles and incongruities that haven't been set up and that the audience isn't ready to accept, such as the sword and stone, rules of succession and Kevin's transformation. <br/><br/>The movie doesn't have a love interest for the protagonist. Kevin loves his fellow minions, and Scarlet and Herb Overkill love each other, but love isn't nearly as important as in the DM movies, with the orphans, the Gru/Lucy and Antonio/Margo romances and the romantic fantasies of the minions. <br/><br/>The music isn't nearly as good. The DM movies have several musical interludes that are fun. ""Minions"" has corpulent palace guards doing a male striptease. <br/><br/>The minions don't seem as fun-loving or playful as in DM. The historic disasters with the dinosaur, bear, pyramid, vampire and cannon are all caused by them trying to be helpful, not by losing attention and engaging in some playful prank. <br/><br/>The violence isn't always comical. Bob lifting an ice bolder over his head, then being crushed under its weight but surviving unscathed is funny. A dinosaur doing a Wile E. Coyote delayed fall over a precipice is funny to a point. Falling to a horrific death is not funny. <br/><br/>The structure is weak. There isn't a strong through line. The stated objective of subjugation of the clan would be considered defeat in any other circumstances. There is no refusal of the call to adventure except by Stuart. Kevin volunteers and Bob eagerly accepts the call. There are several deus ex machina resolutions employing plot devices that weren't foreshadowed. It seems episodic. Some scenes seem self-indulgent, as if included because the filmmakers wanted to show what they could do, not because they advanced the plot or character development. <br/><br/>As an antagonist, Scarlet Overkill doesn't seem villainous enough. She wants to steal the queen's crown, which will somehow give her claim to the throne of England. She seemed like a pale shadow of Johnny English's nemesis, Pascal Sauvage, but motivated by insanity, not by villainy. <br/><br/>The story doesn't have a good theme or moral. The minions bounce from one objective to another and spend much of the movie fleeing for their lives. What message can we take away for our own lives? If you spend eons trying to subjugate your tribe to the rule of another, you will eventually succeed? If you throw off the shackles of one villainous master, you can find another to serve? What sort of message is that for our children? <br/><br/>Despite the many shortcomings relative to the prior DM films, it has many enjoyable moments. The pyramid scene is outrageously funny. It doesn't belong in the film, but it's one of the best scenes."

","Despicable Me and Despicable Me 2 were so good that Illustration Studios had to find out how the Minions would do largely on their own. Usher in Minions, a movie about how the Minions came to be and their adventurous path to meeting Gru.<br/><br/>Without Gru the Minions are just not the same and not as compelling. The Minions movie was an experiment with the sidekicks. It's happened before where a movie was good and the sidekick was such a hit the executives decided to give him his own movie. That usually fails. Minions wasn't a total fail but I was definitely yearning for Gru.<br/><br/>The big villain in this movie was Scarlett Overkill, played by Sandra Bullock. She didn't have the appeal or funniness of Gru. Not only did I find her too verbose, she also didn't seem to fit. She was a supervillain, a villain that all other villains aspired to be like. She was at such a level that she needed no help, yet she employed three wayward minions to steal the Queen of England's crown for her.<br/><br/>The movie had its funny moments; most were for kids and some were for an older audience. The Minions themselves were true to form: unintelligible, bumbling and mischievous. I hate to say that the movie was a money grab but by the end that's what it looked like."

So the idea of a prequel about them was just perfect!<br/><br/>But the film unfortunately fails to meet my expectations, by far. It is impossible to compare this film to any of the previous installments. The film has a lot of jokes, but it has tons of time where you only smile, the screenplay is very inconsistent. It begins very strongly, but then it's like a roller-coaster, ending on a lower not however.<br/><br/>The film should have a way better story, and it had so much possibilities, but the writers went for a lazy story, that felt they made it as they went along. And it gets stranger as it goes. The way they meet Gru is very unoriginal. <br/><br/>It's a lazy film, very inconsistent, and a failed opportunity, its fun, good if you don't expect much, but it to me it was disappointing."

","I'll start off by saying I'm 14. I went to see it with my sister and family friends. The cinema was packed with very young kids, and i think they loved it a lot more than me.<br/><br/>I liked Despicable Me and i loved Despicable Me 2. But Minions fell short without Gru and the comedy was far from original. It was mainly just cheap laughs of a Minion falling over or flying into a pole or pulling funny faces. These pleased the young ones who were screaming in laughter but for the older ones it just felt silly. I gave it a 6 though because there were a few moments that made me laugh in my head and the story wasn't awful. The start was one of the best bits, showing the minions journey through the ages. It went downhill from start to end.<br/><br/>If its a rainy day and your 5 year old child is bored then sacrifice two hours and watch this film: its not unbearable. They will love it, its just it doesn't appeal all ages like the best animated films do like Up and Inside Out. I wouldn't recommend it to my friends but i also wouldn't say avoid it."
"ToBHonest","7","2","3","24 July 2015"," There's Something About those Minions .....
","There is something about those minions, that has grasped my own (and almost everyone else's) attention. And this movie (given with it's title) deliverers all that it states..... Minions!. This film brought me a large amount of joy. I will be honest in stating, that before the lights went out and the film started to play. I was jumping in & out of my seat in excitement to see some 'minion-lovin' fun. And as said, this film delivered its justice.... sadly only in some areas. As I said before the film does deliver what it promises in its title... Minions. But there is a good side and bad side to only giving your audience one thing, and one thing only. <br/><br/>I honestly had high hopes for this film. As any child, parent, or a '6 year old at heart' twenty year old would. Yet somehow it lost me. Everyone who has contact with the out side world, would know about the Minions from 'Despicable Me'. And as they were so largely loved, they were successful enough to gain their own movie. And that is what this film feels like. The directors have taken in too much of the idea that the Minions are famous, and forgot to put in any real plot or emotion toward it. I'll be honest in saying that ""yes, I did laugh"". However as many times as I did laugh, the times I indeed truly laughed, and it wasn't a force of a laugh. It was always aimed in one general area. That area being, not at our heroes 'Kevin', 'Bob', and 'Stuart', but in fact the minions in between the chaos of those three (the minions that were left back 'home' and weren't our main character's). This being because they were Minion's!. Not force a laugh out of a child to gain an honest buck Minion. But the Minion's we fell in love with from the first two 'Despicable Me' film's. The maker's of this film tried too hard to make a successful children's movie, that they forgot what made their Minions iconic in the first place.<br/><br/>Now I know what your thinking ""But wait, how did Sandra Bullock do?"", well I will tell you. Although having a big name like Sandra Bullock may bring in the 'odd older viewer', sadly she didn't save this film. Now don't get me wrong I love Sandra Bullock (honestly some of her movies, give me revisits to when I was a child). Yet the writing of her character (even though a villain) wasn't funny or interesting at all. It just seemed like her character was there to seem like a first pain-of-a-boss to the Minions, and that's all that character did for me. <br/><br/>I don't want to say ""don't go and see this film"". Because obviously everyone has their own opinion, and because I do agree it was a laugh. But if you will take my advice do not go into the theater (or DVD store, depends on when your'e reading this) with extremely high hopes, based on your knowledge from the Minions from the 'Despicable Me' franchise. If it is possible don't go in with any hope's at all. Go in knowing you may or may not laugh, practically don't have any expectations. Just enjoy the film and see what it does for you, in your own 'taste' and 'humor'. You never know what having a clear mind can do for your judgement (that is if you wish to judge at all)."

","I prefer to think there are many criteria that can all be judged diffirently as opposed to an overall rating. Things like Plot, Charatcers/Casting, Enjoyability, Visual Presentation, and heart, and by heart I mean how necesarry I think the movie is narratively. Minions fails on all five levels. It fails on plot right off the bat because you're making a movie about voiceless unfunny phallic symbols that hardly needed to be in the original film, with everything else being so vaguely tied to the main point of the story that it's actually funny. it fails in characters because again, phallic symbols, and they wasted MIchael Keaton, while the actual minions learn nothing from the experience. It fails on enjoyability because it's annoying, painfully unfunny, and has very little coherence to it's own premise. It does passably on visual presentation, the minions and pointy nosed humans are so unmemorably simplistic that you don't remember much of anything. And it fails worst of all on heart, because it's a spinoff for no reason other than the obvious, and it disgusts me that this sits very nearly atop the animation box office."
"Java_Joe","2","1","1","14 August 2019"," Should have stayed as background characters.
","Here's the thing, I liked the minion characters when they were introduced in ""Despicable Me"". They provided some of the comic relief but were generally harmless. But they made such a splash with kids they had a much larger role in the second movie which I felt was too much. Much like Mater, from Pixar's Cars, he was popular with the kids so they gave him a much larger role in the second movie to it's detriment. So it wasn't a surprise that Illumination decided to give the minions their own movie.<br/><br/>The whole thing just feels soulless and corporate. And I admit the only reason I watched it was because I was on a plane and I had either seen or rewatched all the movies I wanted to see and figured it would at least help to pass the time. And it did. But I was not entertained nor did it help with the boredom I find myself in when flying.<br/><br/>The problem with movies like this is they rely too heavily on a character or joke carrying the movie. In this case, it's the minions that need to be minions. They are supposed to follow the strongest and most powerful villain they can find whether it be a dinosaur, Napoleon or the main villain of this movie named Scarlet. And along the way they mess things up in their attempt to be minions to these villains. And that's the movie. Are you laughing yet?<br/><br/>I totally get why they made it. Hollywood isn't interested in making a good movie. They're interested in making money so anything that could net them a profit is then produced. And in Illumination's case it's literally doing whatever they can as cheaply as possible.<br/><br/>Sure their products look good and are popular with the kids but is is asking too much to have a movie that adults can appreciate too?"

","What is this. When the top review right now on IMDb is a troll review giving it a 10/10 you know something is wrong. I get that this film is trying to appeal to kids below the age of 3 with the lack of dialogue and utter absurdity, but at least make it enjoyable to the general public as well. If you want to get an idea of much you might enjoy this film (out of 10), you can simply take the inverse of your age and multiply it by 10. For example, a 1 year old would rate this film a 10/10 and a 25 year old will enjoy this film 0.4/10.<br/><br/>OK now onto the real review. I'll first preface this by saying I really liked the first Despicable Me, and I watch many animated comedies - I'm not some sad old man with no sense of humor. But the attempted comedy in this film is so dry and stupid that it's honestly hard to laugh. Perhaps you can laugh out of pity. At least the emoji movie is a film had expectations so low and responses so bad that we could laugh about it. All this film does is have minions laugh and ""speak"" (more like make random sounds) in an annoying voice. Honestly there's no way you wouldn't hate minions after watching this film. The jokes in this film are unoriginal and poorly integrated.<br/><br/>Plot: There is no plot.<br/><br/>Characters: Lol. (can you really call minions ""characters"" when they have no personality and all look the same?) Setting: OK I'll be honesty, the animation and setting is pretty well made, but there's no reason to watch it for that. It's literally just a high budget DreamWorks animation :/ My advice is don't even take your 1 year old kid to watch it cuz even they will cry at how horrible this film is."
"bonniejoy-978-68763","5","1","1","16 February 2017"," Stupid but Harmless
","The first two Despicable Me movies were delightful movies, thanks to the relationship between Gru and the girls, the interesting stories, and of course the cute minions. For some reason, they became the most popular characters in the series, so much so that Universal wanted to make a movie based off these guys. Where do I begin on how that doesn't work? <br/><br/>1) The narrator. This guy speaks in the beginning and end of the movie. While I don't hate the narrator completely it causes the audience to lose investment in the characters, because the narrator is doing their job of figuring out the situation or letting any emotion sink in. <br/><br/>2) How do you make a movie solely about the minions? It was one thing to make a movie about the Madagascar Penguins, because they were great stand alone characters. The Minions on the other hand have little to no personality and speak mixed languages (with no subtitles added). The only reason they were likable in the first two movies was, because they were cute side characters that could make anything they did mindlessly adorable, and they were under the main character's leadership. Even the movie knows that on their own, they aren't that great, so the writers just throw the minions into whatever crazy thing they think of, from the evolution of the characters to one getting crowned king for pulling out a sword, causing Elizabeth the Second to resign, to constantly finding a new master. <br/><br/>3) The villain. Scarlet Overkill is built up to be the greatest super villain of all time. What is her big diabolical plan to prove her worth? Steal the Queen of England's crown. Pretty underwhelming plan. It would be more impressive if her plan had been to kill the queen and become queen in her place. Also, in the end, she's defeated by boy Gru. That's gotta be a sad day for a villain to be defeated by a child. And she's pretty whiny. Why are the supposed to be ""greatest villains"" whiny? While her weaponized dress is cool, her plan and character development are just not that impressive. <br/><br/>4) The ending. (SPOILERS) So Scarlet's defeated, the minions return Elizabeth's crown, she knights them, they're heroes, they come across young Gru, and follow him to be villains again. The motivation all along had been for them to find an evil leader to assist. Now they're England's greatest heroes and are their own masters. Inserting Gru and reminding us of the motivation at the last minute was the movie shortcutting its way into trying to tie into the Despicable Me series. It doesn't work anymore. They're heroes and their own masters. The minions now have no point in working for Gru anymore now that they're worshiped by England, since they would be given anything they wanted now. <br/><br/>Okay so is there anything good? The animation's good of course. The weapons Scarlet gives the three minions are awesome and I'd love to see them in the third Despicable Me movie. Please put the lava gun, hypnotic hat, and stretchy suit in Despicable Me 3! Occasionally the minions are allowed to have a few emotional moments when the narrator doesn't get in the way, and it always feels genuine. And as much as I hate to admit it, gigantic Kevin kinda makes the movie worth at least one viewing. <br/><br/>Aside from that, the movie's completely pointless. It's not a terrible movie; it's just stupid while also being harmless. I still refuse to believe it's the prequel of the Despicable Me movies. I still stand with my theory that the minions are vitamin pills that Gru brought to life."

Not really a major concern but I hate it when American movies use racial stereotypes against England and France, again not major just a minor gripe. Very immature and just basic toilet humour which I guess is perfect for young children but the very best animated movies supply enough for both.

You could argue that it's a kid's movie so I can't say that, but that is probably the least valid argument you can make about any movie. Considering the amount of kid's movies that have been enjoyed by all ages, you really can't just pull out that excuse for this movie specifically. <br/><br/>The movie really just wasn't that funny. I could tell that it tried to appeal to an older audience, but it didn't work for me. It was all just referential humor that won't be funny in a few years when those trends have expired and no one has any idea what they meant. I can't say the characters were good or bad because I didn't know what any of them were saying. Although I can say that I don't think Sandra Bullock was a good choice for Scarlet Overkill. She just didn't feel right with the role. Her voice didn't match with her character very well, nor did she seem to be at all into her role. <br/><br/>Overall Minions is just a poorly made movie.

Taking the nature of these momentary laughs to create a full feature film turned out to feel actually quite empty. There's a plot-line, there's a hero, there are villains (often confused with the hero, on purpose). Yet, none of it seems to really matter. All of our main characters were not made to be main characters.<br/><br/>This isn't to say there aren't some funny moments. There are three or four truly hilarious situations, in true minions style.

Sadly, Overkill turns out to be pretty uninteresting and clichéd character.<br/><br/>Not to worry though - we never tired of the minions themselves.<br/><br/>The comedy is mostly slapstick with a few jokes thrown in for the adults. It's rarely laugh-out-loud funny, but it's pleasantly amusing. The scenes set in London make use of good- humoured caricatures of England, including a few cameos from the queen herself.<br/><br/>If you like the characters of the minions (and who doesn't?) you can't really go wrong with this movie."

","Oh, those silly little minions. They're sort of like modern-day Smurfs, only funny. Though I haven't seen the Despicable Me movies, it's not hard to see the minions contributed a great deal to the films' popularity, so it was just a matter of time before they'd get their own film. After all, Minions is a dream come true for everyone wanting more minions. While this film is obviously Slapstick Central, that's also its biggest flaw. <br/><br/>We're treated to the history of the minions as they travel from one age to the next in search of a Boss to serve, an evil mastermind worthy of their service. After accidentally killing the Dinosaurs and the Egyptians, they hide in a cave on what I think is the North Pole. They build their little village and there was much rejoicing. But...they felt something was missing. Slowly but surely, the minions got bored since they didn't have a villain to serve. That's when one of the minions, Kevin, got an idea: he'll venture out into the wild with a few volunteers to find an evil mastermind. The two volunteers are Stuart who literally doesn't know what he's getting himself into, but is excited because others are excited, and Bob, basically useless but excited. Their travels lead them to New York, Orlando, in the lair of super-villain Scarlet Overkill and eventually England. <br/><br/>Unsurprisingly, it's the minions that are the biggest source of humor. A lot of detail went into their interactions with the world and each other. The presence of a lot - perhaps too much - slapstick isn't surprising. What is surprising are the number of in-jokes and cultural references, some of them quite clever. I liked the British Police officers who pour tea into their cups even when they're in a high-speed chase. Also cute is when several minions try to get to England and end up on what appears to be the moon...which is eventually revealed to be a set where the fake moon landing is being shot, oh snap! <br/><br/>The downside is that, like all slapstick, you quickly reach the limit of how much you can take. I like Laurel and Hardy, but I've usually had my fill after an hour and a half. Minions thankfully intersperses its slapstick with a lot of cultural references, like the ones mentioned above, but yet another minion crashing into an immovable object quickly loses its potency after about 90 minutes. The same goes for the villain, Scarlet Overkill (Sandra Bullock), who I just couldn't get into. She and her partner(-in-crime) Herb (Jon Hamm) have some funny interplay, but her antics get old real quick. <br/><br/>It takes a particular kind of person to step into Minions and be surprised with the end result. You know what you're getting yourself into: minions, minions, slapstick, and even more minions. (Did I mention the minions?) While the slapstick got old after a while (your mileage may vary though), the in-jokes and cultural references add to the film's durability."

And their journey takes them on a wild adventure. The drive of this movie is the interactions between the Minions, their expressions and how they go about it. Which is actually pretty creative for the most part. Overall this is a movie kids will have a blast with it and adults will at least be amused with it.<br/><br/>7.3/10"

","Well, needless to say, I love minions! From the first time they appeared on screen, I got really really obsessed with them. I think that along with the Penguins from Madagascar and Scrat from the Ice Age they are the best ""supporting"" figures in such movies. <br/><br/>When the movie was out, I rushed to the cinemas to watch it, along with some other 30 something geeks and of course lots of parents with their children, with the same immaturity I guess but with an excuse at least... <br/><br/>The movie was disappointing. Apart from a few laughs at the beginning, at some point all this made-up language of the minions was too much and it began to tire me. The story was nothing too elaborate or crafted. It seemed like the simplest scenario they could get to get the movie out. I cannot pin point exactly what it was that did not cut it for me, but I think that the language part was quite significant. <br/><br/>I would expect something more adult-appropriate, as let's face it, these movies are not just for kids anymore. It's a really really generous 6/10 from me for this one."

","Minions is the third movie in a trilogy (first were Despicable Me and Despicable Me 2).<br/><br/>however its occurs before the events in the first two films.<br/><br/>I did not have many expectations coming into the movie – and apparently that was good. The movie has no cleverness or sophistication. The plot makes no sense and the jokes are simply not funny.<br/><br/>I guess The Minions can be somewhat enjoyable if you come with the right, silly mood.

","The Minions Movie, yes it's the big movie to talk about, it's the film that everyone wanted to see; is it good? Well to be honest ""Minions"" the movie is exactly what you'd expect to see. If you liked Despicable Me or Despicable Me 2, then you'll like Minions just as good. Minions is a cute movie and has the standard comedy as Despicable Me. The quality of the film is just as good if not the same, and the voices are just as good as Despicable Me.<br/><br/>Many people gripe about this film and others talk about how great it is, the truest response is it isn't any different in quality etc from any film released within this genre or style. I love the Minions, the movie was fun, their humor and venture was all the more reason to watch and enjoy. Minions is a great family film and we recommend if you haven't saw it to check it out. If you're expecting it to be the biggest blockbuster of a life-time then you're gonna get your feelings hurt."

","Aw, who doesn't love these cute minions? They are simply adorable as they search for the best 'bad' leader. I fell in love with the little Bob and his bear. The story was good and I liked how it eventually tied them to Gru. My kids laughed throughout the movie and its one that we would watch again when it comes on TV. The gibberish they speak never left you wondering what was said. You got the idea and many of the words come through anyway. This is a movie I would recommend to any family. I can't say that i cared for the villain too much, i generally dislike villains that never seem to get hurt etc. But I love those little yellow dudes!"

","As a big fan of the Despicable Me movie, I was disappointed by its sequel (Despicable Me 2). And thus I hesitated a long time to go and see 'Minions'. But as I went to the movies with a friend, who wanted to see the movie, I gave it a shot. And I must say, I am happily impressed. Lots of fun and cuteness with a nice story behind all it. An enjoyable time is what you'll have if you go and watch 'Minions'. This movie speaks to everyone. Go and watch it with your family, your friends, or even your girl-/boyfriend and you won't be disappointed. So if you, like me, had doubts about this movie because Despicable Me 2 was a bit of a letdown, I'm here to tell you that they made up for it. You'll enjoy lots of laughs, lots of 'awww's, and have fun watching 'Minions'."

","I know that the Minions are supposed to be evil but they didn't have to make the movie that dark and twisted because my Dad and my brother & I did not like the movie as much, I mean there were some funny parts in it. But for the most part we felt this was way too dark for kids to watch because a lot of people love the minions but not dark and evil minions I'm just saying. This is a movie that I would just wait until it comes out on DVD because it really wasn't that good but then again you guys might like it so I could be wrong about all of this. They should just stick with Despicable Me and leave the minions to work with their boss Gru because that is how they became so popular when the first Despicable Me came out into the public. I also believe that this movie would be a bad influence on little kids that adore and love the minions because they are not as innocent as they look in Despicable Me."
"tenyearreunion","6","1","1","24 July 2015"," I LOVE Minions, but was sadly disappointed.
","As my title says, I loved the Minions in DM1 and DM2, I cannot tell you how much I looked forward to this film, especially after seeing the trailer which, I suppose as expected, has the best of the one liners.<br/><br/>Maybe my expectations were too high but I was left disappointed. The plot is just not very good and just not funny enough. Some laughs, don't get me wrong, but considering the potential with these funny yellow blighters, not nearly enough. DM1 and DM2 had me quoting lines for days after and chuckling to myself (It's so fluffy!!!). Minions has one line (or word, you all know it!) and that is about it.<br/><br/>The first few minutes of this film had far more potential (those that have watched it will probably understand what I mean) and I wished the had spent the first film charting their progress through history. Maybe the will be left for the inevitable Prequel!!<br/><br/>I am sure plenty of kids and families will love it. I saw it with several 7 year olds who said it was good, but I guess that was post cinema excitement. All parents agreeing it wasn't DM.<br/><br/>On the cast note, I like Sandra Bullock, but her voice adds nothing to the character. Poor casting I'm afraid. Whoever cast Gru got it spot on for an animated film.<br/><br/>The franchise will make a killing out of the merchandise which is everywhere. They've done THAT job very well. I just wished they had spent a little more time on the gags."
"austoon-68199","1","7","18","25 July 2015"," One of the worst and cheapest cash-grabs in movie history
","This has to be the most uninspired cash grab I have ever seen. I came in with low expectations, watched it bored, and left in anger. Even though I didn't pay to see this, I still feel cheated as a moviegoer.<br/><br/>Nobody tried on this movie. None of the characters were interesting and I wanted the minions to die every time they got in a life-threatening situation. I don't understand why they're so beloved.<br/><br/>The thing that makes movies like Pixar films and a FEW of Dreamworks' stuff good is the humanity, emotion, and storytelling. This had none of that. You don't feel anything. You shouldn't even CARE about the minions. They're just living merchandise that can move and talk on screen. The first Despicable Me definitely had emotion to it and it was decent. This was kinda like Despicable Me 2, but far worse.<br/><br/>I could also tolerate a movie with few emotional substance, if it at least had enough humor to make it watchable. But it didn't even have that many jokes either! I didn't laugh once, except for a chuckle or two. The people in the theater that did laugh didn't even laugh that hard.<br/><br/>The 60's references were predictable (Look! The Beatles are walking across Abbey Road!) and while the soundtrack was my kind of music, it was all just generic 60's music hits. Like every major artist from the 60's had a song in the movie. Nothing you haven't heard before.<br/><br/>The only thing holding me back from giving this the lowest possible score of 0.5/5 is that it didn't have Video Brinquedo-quality animation. But it still wasn't incredible or impressive in any way. At this point it's honestly hard to find a CGI movie with unique and stunning animation, except Hotel Transylvania or Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs.<br/><br/>If you have a faint interest in seeing this, just don't buy a ticket for it. Watch Inside Out or Ant-Man or another good movie then sneak in to see it. But even seeing it for free wasn't worth my time.<br/><br/>Destroy Illumination Entertainment. Destroy the people behind this movie. Destroy every person that clamored for more minions and enjoyed this filth. Destroy every person responsible for this dreck. Destroy this planet.<br/><br/>Animation is dead. Cinema is dead. Humanity is dead. We caused this Hell and deserve to live in it and suffer."
"mwcaboose","3","9","25","10 July 2015"," A boring and uninteresting cash-grab. (What you expected.)
","Be honest. You knew this was gonna be bad. I went into ""Minions"" expecting exactly what I got in return.<br/><br/>The ""Minion"" characters were first introduced in ""Despicable Me"" (2010), and were a very creative and original concept. the idea of yellow, gibberish-speaking freaks as side characters was actually kind of funny. ""Despicable Me"" was a huge success financially, and was generally received well with most critics. After this, the minions were everywhere, and I mean EVERYWHERE. Toys, video games, clothes, backpacks, mugs, even amusement park rides. So naturally, a sequel was inevitable. And so came ""Despicable Me 2"" (2013). They did a good job ""upping the ante"" with the laughs and and the characters were even better than the first. I really enjoyed the combo of Steve Carell and Kristen Wiig, but the main antagonist, while funny, was not as good as Vector. The ""Minion Craze"" however led to most of the film focusing on them. It could be funny at times, but overall didn't work, which was really my only problem with the film, other than the lack of a little more character development.<br/><br/>So just when you thought Illumination Entertainment were going to make another original movie, in comes the announcement of a Minion spin- off, literally called ""Minions"". Original, right?<br/><br/>I really didn't know what they were going to do with their ""characters"" in this film, which are Bob, Kevin, and Stuart. Yeah, remember those minions that were mentioned like once or twice in the previous films? Yeah? Well now they're main characters for some reason. I mean, what else could you've done? The Minions are a completely disposable group of ""characters"" with literally no personality traits to differ one from another. There are literally THOUSANDS of them, kinda like the Clone Troopers from ""Attack of the Clones"" (2002). They ended up giving over-used, boring ""personalities"" to them. Kevin was the leader, who only wants to be respected by his tribe. Bob was the kind-hearted, lovable one. And Stuart was the idiotic ""bad boy"" who liked music for some reason? What makes these traits even more stupid is that they are never mentioned in the originals, and they probably won't be in any upcoming sequels either.<br/><br/>I am glad, however that there are actually HUMAN characters in the film. Scarlet Overkill, played by Sandra Bullock, is the films main antagonist. Sadly however, her personality and monologue are also over-used and generic. A female antagonist seemed pretty cool, and you can tell she has some traits similar to a ""James Bond"" villain. Until they explain that the reason that she's evil is that she was abandoned as a child, and only wanted to be adored and loved by the world, like a queen. Yeah. You've heard it before. Not to mention that to me Bullock's voice acting seemed pretty wooden, like she just kept her eyes on the script the whole time she recorded her lines. It may be just me, but probably not, considering how many other problems this movie has. Her boyfriend Herb, played by Jon Hamm, while sort of funny at times, was also pretty flat and boring, like literally every OTHER human characters.<br/><br/>Back to the humor. Again, after TWO other movies, the Minions just aren't funny. Not to mention all the 60's and 80's pop-culture jokes and British stereotypes that I'm sure no kid in the theater would understand, as well as a flat-out SEX JOKE, that oddly enough, I'm sure most kids in the theater WOULD get.<br/><br/>However. There was actually one bit that I laughed at, where Kevin is fooling around with one of Herb's machines. It quite possibly was the only thing I could call funny about ""Minions"". (But I won't explain it in detail, because this is a no spoiler review.)<br/><br/>I just don't get it. Both kids and their parents busted out laughing at the most dumb attempts at comedy you've ever seen. I just don't understand why people are still eating up what I dubbed ""Minion Humor"".<br/><br/>But again, it is what I expected: Not god-awful, but not good whatsoever. But I might be going a little to rough on it. It's just difficult for me to understand why everyone wanted a solo Minion feature so badly. To be honest, It would be sort of idiotic not to make one, considering how much money they've made with the franchise. (They even recycled music from the other installments) But it's not like they didn't try, considering how clear and detailed the animation looks. It just seemed very rushed, and if they could flesh out the human characters a little more and add better humor (Considering most of the ""okay"" humor was in the trailers), it could've been a lot better.<br/><br/>Sadly, it wasn't.<br/><br/>The kids for sure will enjoy ""Minions"" (below 10 yrs). Parents (More than likely) will find this boring at times or somewhat entertaining. (But who knows, everyone else on IMDb seems to like it.)<br/><br/>""Minions"" was a huge success on opening day and, sadly, will for sure be one of the Summer's award-winning, block-busters."

","Went to see this with my family including two sons, 7 and 13. That is usually the reason I go to see animated films of course, though as parents they are usually the only reasons to actually get to a cinema.<br/><br/>Sadly, although I was quite looking forward to this one, it was a let- down. The best feature (to start positive) was the incredible skill of the animation - but that's also kind of a given these days, isn't it?<br/><br/>On to the bad aspects - there's a huge lack of story involved here, unless you can call some fairly random events and experiences a 'story'. The lack of real language holds the minions back as characters. Not as much a problem when they were only 'supporting' characters. Some scenes and jokes do not seem child friendly to me either - too retro or borderline inappropriate (torture being funny?). My kids didn't laugh all that much either when watching.<br/><br/>Perhaps it had something, as I was browsing IMDb afterwards and felt like adding my first review due to this film.

"evilpopcornguy","5","3","6","13 July 2015"," An OK movie, but probably the most important animated feature of the year for fans of a certain Disney film...
","There is a general consensus that animated movies nowadays ought to be held to a certain standard; that being that they should be made for both children and adults rather than just pandering to what a child may want to see for and hour and a half. I proudly say that ""Minions"" is not a movie of that caliber. Not even close. It is pure childlike nonsense that any remotely responsible adult can tolerate. It rests somewhere firmly between an enjoyable trip to the zoo and sulking around a Chuck E Cheese.<br/><br/>One of the chief concerns of naysayers when trailers dropped was that Minions can't talk. That should have been a real red flag for people because you can't have a film that features 3 main characters who talk in a language the audience doesn't understand and expect it to legitimately work unless you use subtitles. This was not really a problem because the titular Minions are animated with a lot of charisma and physicality, the audience understands just enough, especially when the screenwriters cheat a bit and force them to use English words whenever they feel that kids would be completely lost if they didn't.<br/><br/>Now I'd have to be stupid to walk into this movie and expect to legitimately find it gripping given what we've seen these little screwballs do in the ""Despicable Me"" films, and thankfully it delivered. I'd rather watch a movie about these little guys embrace the stupidity of it all than try to be something it isn't. I don't want to watch a spinnoff of a movie that features a bad guy who hid a pyramid by painting it blue and have it try to be ""Grave of the Fireflies"". All they do for the first half hour is fart around from place to place and joke to joke until they find a new master. Once the plot gets going, it seems a bit tired. It just seems like they wrote the 2nd half of Despicable Me 3 except there's no Gru around. It's pretty predictable and childish, but ,again, that's why we're here.<br/><br/>Now as long as your sensibilities are appropriately lowered, there is a bit to enjoy about certain parts of the movie. As opposed to other movies like ""Home"" or ""Strange Magic"" that are either genuinely awful or boring for anyone who can list all 5 vowels, ""Minions"" actually has moments of being genuinely cute and more, more, more, more moments of being so surreal that adults will be invested if only to see what they're going to do next. It's not every day an adult can say that he saw a movie where the main characters are hanged, but don't die because they don't have necks; so they just laugh, fall through the noose, and climb back up to fall though again. That's just the tip of the iceberg in terms of the insanity. There's a homage to Ghostbusters, a family of hitchhikers who turn out to be bank robbers, a scene implying that a minion had a threesome with two fire hydrants, and a sequence where three British guards are hypnotized into stripping to their underwear and dancing while swinging hair that drops below their waists. I don't think that anyone who actually bothered to go see this movie would be put off by these sequences to deem them too weird for them, myself included. Now everyone generally shares my thoughts that ""Minions"" was a fun, if stupid, kids film. It won't win any Oscars because ""Inside Out"" is a thing now, but people say that it was a fine film that isn't even worth nitpicking. I mean honestly, you can be busy pointing out plot holes, but you may as well scold a refrigerator for being cold. I say this because I am going to make a prediction that is already starting to come true:<br/><br/>PEOPLE. ARE. GOING. TO. HATE. THIS. MOVIE. HATE IT. And that is the best thing to happen to ""Frozen"".<br/><br/>Why? Because of the marketing. ""Minions"" is probably the best thing to happen to ""Frozen"" fans since the Nostalgia Critic's Disneycember review. One of the few legitimate criticism against it as an IP rather than just as a film is that ""Frozen"" suffers from too much overexposure and merchandising, which is true despite my fervent love of the film. <br/><br/>Deadline.com says:<br/><br/>""Yep, there is no escaping the saturation of minion products: band- aids, backpacks, thumb drives, wrapping paper, pencil sets, key chains, iPhone cases, lunch boxes, sleeping bags, action figures, bedspreads, floor mats, umbrellas, straws, travel neck cushion pillows, flip flops, cake toppers (edible and not), thermoses, car decals, napkin holders, piggy banks, body pillows, cookie cutters, bath towels, area rugs, men's ties, shower curtain hooks, luggage tags, toothbrushes, wallpaper, drapes, popsicle sticks, banana scented bubble bath, sleepwear, eyewear, underwear, overwear  Somebody stop them. No. Really.""<br/><br/>Anyone with half a brain could see the merchandising taking root. But unlike Frozen which could only effectively market to girls, Minions merch can be gender neutral (or made for a specific gender) and require far less creativity to make. My prediction also states that people will leave ""Frozen"" alone in terms of merchandising and turn to ""Minions"" instead. ""Frozen"" certainly has more artistic merit and deserves a fair analysis free from marketing bias more than ""Minions"" does because it certainly tries to be more than just a fun diversion. ""Minions"" is here to restore some balance to the world.<br/><br/>While the marketing has no effect on the quality of the film, it will cause an inevitable hype backlash; which is really a shame because the movie's not worth hating. The only real downside is that it's horribly juvenile and has no redeeming qualities beyond providing an hour and a half of surreal humor.<br/><br/>5/10 Don't bother to own this movie, but see it in theaters or rent it when it gets to Redbox or Netlix."
"burlesonjesse5","6","3","6","13 July 2015"," VIEWS ON FILM review of Minions
","I'm not a father but I have a niece and three nephews. Over the years, I've learned that if you plop them in front of a television set and turn on anything cartoon-related, they become spellbound. They stop all the jibber jabber, they tune the adults (and each other) out, and basically stare straight forward. In context, everyone under the age of 6 gets into the zone. Minions, which currently seems to be hauling in monster box office receipts, is the type of animated film that will provide youngins with this sort of childlike fix. It's beautiful to look at with 3D effects that start off robust and strong. And let's face it, what adolescent doesn't like main characters who are goofy and look like Tic Tacs containing a flavor that can't be identified yet.<br/><br/>But wait. What about the adults that have to accompany said kids due to the flick's MPAA rating and their overall concept of necessitated supervision? Well, they might find things unfocused and undisciplined. I'm mean sure you have a fresh and original sense of time and place (the late 1960's to be exact), a rugged, arena rock soundtrack (with tunes by The Who, The Rolling Stones, and The Spencer Davis Group), and of course, some suggestive PG-rated, adult humor. But no amount of this upbringing could ever keep you, the adult, from having your patience tested (I know mine was). At the half hour mark, I found Minions as creatures, to be quite annoying. They spoke in a language that I couldn't understand (I heard it was a hint of Spanish, whatever) and in all honesty, they needed some serious anxiety medication. As the end credits rolled I thought to myself, why couldn't the descendants of Despicable Me fame make this decade of discontent a little more groovier man. Oh well.<br/><br/>Slated as a prequel to the Despicable Me film series (mentioned one sentence ago) and featuring the voice-over work of Micheal Keaton (he must have done a heck of an accent because I couldn't identify who his character was), Minions begins a long time ago (we're talking the dinosaur period). These things obviously don't age and carry that Forest Gumpian gene. They've seen it all, done it all, and even manage to kill Napoleon. Now they need a new leader. Their solution: Go to New York City circa 1968 and befriend a supervillain named Scarlet Overkill (voiced by Sandra Bullock). That's the gist here and I dare you to follow verbatim, the actual plot points presented. I myself, drifted into a monotonous frenzy while throwing my hands way up in the air (there seemed to be a lot of globetrotting going on with these energetic, cuddly varmints. The only thing I ended up focusing on was if they had one eye or two).<br/><br/>In conclusion, Minions has a visual richness and a canvas containing hundreds of pixels (in many a frame). However, it's unnecessarily feverish, incoherent, and messy. As you watch it, you forget that you're following a story and instead, you see various scenes at random. Frankly, it's hard to get a handle on the plot threads if it weren't for a narrative device in the first ten minutes and one in the last fifteen. I categorize this close-up fest as an animated version of Frank Zappa's 200 Motels (1971) and denounce it as possibly the first true stoner flick since The Beatles cartoon vehicle, Yellow Submarine. Does that mean that these proceedings are recommendable? Hardly. In truth, I've never seen the movies that spawned this 2015 release (Despicable Me and Despicable Me 2). And according to my fellow critic (and near-adult colleague, Cole Pollyea), you're better off checking out those endeavors instead. However, if you choose to take the kiddies to Minions, be warned. They'll eat it up (it's safe to say that little ones won't care one iota about the plot) while you'll be anxiously waiting for the closing curtain. The result: A mixed review from me at 2 and a half stars.<br/><br/>Of note: The one word spoken by the Minions that translated into anything English, was ""banana"". It turned into a zinger that generated a small chuckle from my end. Everything else was total gibberish (that includes the whole running time of ninety-one minutes)."
"The_Film_Cricket","Null","3","6","11 July 2015"," Cute, funny little Ba-Baaaa!
","You just have to smile when you see The Minions. They're cute, happy, jolly little fellas with a babbling speech pattern, a drive born of basic instinct, and a talent for being loyal to a fault. They're like happy-go-lucky little boys who are mischievous but not malicious despite their lot in life. As supporting characters in any of these big budget animated series go, they are the most welcomed in my book right up there with Scrat, and now they have their own movie. Does it work? Yes. It's adorable, cute and funny. Is it original? No, but that's not the point.<br/><br/>The only point of comparison with The Minions that I can think of is last year's Penguins of Madagascar, another off-shoot of a popular animated series. The difference is that The Penguins come with a particular skill set, a drive toward absolutely flawless organization that made their adventure somewhat predictable, i.e. they can take care of themselves. The Minions aren't quite that smart. Their forward momentum is more random leaving them more vulnerable and, for the viewer, more interesting.<br/><br/>Minions, naturally, is an origin story. It's not only set before their adventures in Despicable Me it follows The Minions from the dawn of history (with an opening narration by Geoffrey Rush) where we meet them at the amoeba stage (they had goggles before they had limbs) and follow them up through the Jurassic period, the Neolithic period, Ancient Egypt, 19th century Europe, and on up to the post modern era. Unlike their evolutionary brothers, The Minions aren't driven by a need for superiority but by the desire to serve a master, particularly an evil one. The trouble is, they have a knack for mischief which often ends with their chosen master meeting a grisly fate. The Minions' evolution is kind of a head-scratcher because apparently they're all male and they seem to live forever as evidence by the fact that we follow our heroes from the beginning of time up through the late 1960s.<br/><br/>Either way, Minions follows their pursuit of an evil employer through history; working for everyone from a T-Rex to The Pharaohs to a Count Dracula (the best gags in the movie are spoiled in the trailer). Desiring to end their search, three Minions named Kevin, Stuart and Bob head out into the world to find a suitable employer. But it's not until they arrive in London circa 1968 that their search comes to a head. Boosted by the information about a century's old annual convention of supervillians, the boys find work with a superstar villain called Scarlett Overkill (voiced by Sandra Bullock) who wants to steal Queen Elizabeth's crown, thereby becoming Queen of England. I'm pretty sure that's not how that works, but okay.<br/><br/>The rest of the plot I can't really describe because there isn't a lot of plot from there on. Most of the movie is made up of a series of cute and funny gags as the boys bumble around a 1960s London that has been taken over by the pop culture of Warhol and The Beatles. It's actually a lot of fun, and the soundtrack is amazing. One of the best gags involves Kevin, Stuart and Bob accidentally stumbling upon Abbey Road just at the moment that four lads from Liverpool are crossing the street.<br/><br/>What doesn't work so well is the story. It's bulky and much of it deals with the Minions trying to defeat a big, bad enemy leading to one of those long tired old Battle-in-the-Streets that we've seen a million times before. In the world of animation it's so much fun when the filmmakers can find a way to spin their characters into other worlds, other dimensions and get away from formula. Look at two recent animated pictures Inside-Out and The LEGO Movie. Both involved a climax that worked because it came out of the story, not just because the story needed an ending. Why not have the Minions chase their foe through time, or around the globe, or to different planets, or to different dimensions, or different multi-verses? Or even different movie-universes? The possibilities are endless.<br/><br/>Actually Minions didn't really need a story. It might have worked just as well dealing with the Minions on their historical journey. I argued last year that Penguins of Madagascar might have worked just as well as a sort of ersatz nature documentary, freeing it from the confines of a standard story. I maintain that argument here. Just let the movie be a series of funny sight gags with only a hint of a plot.<br/><br/>Still despite those issue Minions is a fun time. I'm happy that the studio decided to give The Minions their own movie instead of the predictable route of going right into Despicable Me 3 (stay tuned). The kids will enjoy this movie because of The Minions, and the parents will enjoy it because of all the nods to the 1960s. I wouldn't recommend seeing this before seeing Inside Out, but when you do you'll have a good time."

","The movie was made in good heart and intent to entertain I felt, and in the end it did not seem as tho it fell short of that mark. It was just a nice ""movie"" for patient folk. I think what appealed to the crowd was the appeal, like how attractive certain characters were.<br/><br/>For me, there were 2 big things. It involved the city I lived in, which makes me sit up and smack my hands together. The biggest part tho was when there was a rat. It was so cute, didn't look particularly fake nor too realistic in ways. I have loved art/animation since I was 3, and I loved this rat!<br/><br/>I think one of the other most intelligent parts, if not a most important point, was the way they made doing crime an accepted even ""family"" activity. It just made it all the more real, the way movies today keep seeming to make the bad guys good---but this was genius! The way they acted seemed so strong it jumped out at you, the way you imagine a bad guy talking about his or her needs and seeming more like real people."

The animation was very well done, if all a bit dizzy (come on, can we slow it down a bit please?)But to engage such dark themes and characters, who say such GODLESS THINGS, in a child's movie, was BEYOND irresponsible. Shame on Bullock for participating in what could have easily just have been a sweet kiddie movie. NO, you HAD to turn it into something SO SCARY my toddler stopped liking Minions ALTOGETHER. And, just so you know, my TODDLER laughed at your evolution bit, it's such a stupid idea. Can't you people grow up and realize evolution is a failed attempt by children to hiss at God? GROW UP!

","Minions is basically Cars 2 or Planes from a logic standpoint. The only reason it's made is to sell minions merchandise to billions of screaming toddlers. The Minions were funny comedic reliefs but they were far from what made Despicable Me and its sequel enjoyable. IMO, it was Gru and his unique relationship with everyone.<br/><br/>From a film standpoint, it's only slightly more enjoyable than Cars 2/Planes. Unlike the other two, this one has it's funny gags going for it. I'll admit, the Minions are funny. Not hilarious, but funny. However, the positives stop there. The film is so, so predictable, it's funny. It is literally every origin story you've heard before. It is literally Monsters University except with Minions. Also, it uses every kids movie trope you can think of. ""Hip"" and ""Cool"" talk? Check. Pop culture references? Check. Bathroom jokes? Check. Annoying voices from anyone who's not yellow? Check. It's the same pandering clichés we've seen from every Dreamworks film in the mid-2000s. In terms of the characters, besides the Minions, a few cracked maybe a slight laugh out of me, but the rest are either stupid or annoying. Again, typical trope of mid-2000s Dreamworks films.<br/><br/>How about the animation? Of course I like the Minions' character designs, and some of the backgrounds and textures look nice- in the first quarter of the film-, but MY GOD are the character designs awkward to look at! All of their humans have thin heads and fat bodies or the other way around. Oh, and don't forget the ultra tiny eyes! This was one of my biggest (and only) gripes about the Despicable Me films, as well as in that garbage known as ""The Lorax"", and it's no different here!<br/><br/>So to sum up, Minions has no purpose other than merchandise. I wanted to be surprised by the film. Even coming from someone who loved the Despicable Me films, Minions is a completely predictable, clichéd, and pandering movie that sort of works as a prequel to its predecessors but does not work as a film by itself. Yes, it made me laugh sometimes, but being funny can't be the only trait of the movie. Everywhere else it fails.<br/><br/>Adults are going to roll their eyes at this movie, even ones (like I said before) that liked DM and/or DM2. This film is mainly a time waster for children, and those who live the minions at that.

"RustyShacklefordd","4","7","21","1 July 2015"," Lacks The Substance To Justify Being A Feature-Length Film
","I enjoyed the Despicable Me films. However, I was never really all that crazy about the minions. They would make me chuckle occasional, but I never found them to be the main attraction of those films like a lot of people do. I feel like they've just been really overexposed now to the point it's become annoying. With that said, I was really hoping this movie would surprise me as Despicable Me did. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, it's was pretty much exactly what I expected to be. I wouldn't go as far as saying it's terrible, but it's not good. The main problem with the film is that the Minions don't provide enough substance to justify a feature-length film. What made Despicable Me work was that it had fun characters and humor that could be enjoyed by both kids and adults. Minions on the other hand relies almost completely on the simplest of slapstick humor which gets old quickly. As far as the plot goes, it's pretty weak and feels almost non- existent at times. It honestly felt like more of a television special than an actual movie. There were a few moments that made me chuckle, but by the 40 minute mark I was bored and ready for it to wrap up. Sandra Bullock's character was disappointing as well. I was hoping she would be sort of a female Gru, but she was very generic and rather dull. I also found the animation to be pretty bland compared to a lot of other recent animated films. <br/><br/>Even though it does have some chuckle-worthy moments and features one of the best soundtracks in a film this year, I can't really recommend it. Even with a short running time, there just isn't enough here to justify this feature-length spin-off. While it never gets quite as annoying as I feared, the humor is just too repetitive and shallow for it to really appeal to anyone over the age of 10. This one is strictly for the kids. Minions ends up being another example of what happens when Hollywood tries to milk too much of a good thing."

","Armed with my young son and ready for an afternoon's entertainment, we sat down to ""Minions"" with eager anticipation. Sadly, the film is simply not up to the hype that surrounded it. I am sure that technically it was brilliant and the software was wonderful, but when you have an audience of over 80% children (under 10 years old) who are simply not laughing, you know it has missed ... badly. The pre-show ads got more laughs. The story is simple enough and is easy to follow for any pre-school audience member. It is always worth watching an audience leave and to try to follow the buzz. In this case, the audience left within the first seconds of the credits starting, and the auditorium was empty (save for us) before the credits ended."

","We were Looking forward to another Despicable Me based movie, but this was awful. The first ten minutes were cute, with a historical look back at the minions evolution through history. Fast forward past this segment and the movie went from promising to awful. The plot gets stuck in the 1960s for the remainder of the film. UGH, no one under 60 could relate to this era, let alone any children. The theater was silent for most of the movie, very few audience responses. <br/><br/>Also the Minions themselves (again past about ten minutes) grew boring and bland from lack of coherent dialogue. They cannot carry a film for this reason, unlike the Penguins from Madagascar. We guess we expected more, but got way less. We will not be adding this to our Blu-Ray collection."
"ravsten428","5","3","7","13 July 2015"," Could have been more planned out.
","The Minions movie is somewhat humorous, but that's about it.<br/><br/>Being a fan of the first two films I had high expectations for this one. I am a big fan of the minions and thought this would be a refreshing treat. I don't go to watch movies in theaters much, so I decided to watch it on YouTube before it was taken down.<br/><br/>Long story short, our lovable minions are looking for an evil leader to tag along with. After several mishaps with apparent baddies, our minions seem to lose hope. One of the minions decides to travel the world looking for a leader to call their own. Three of them Bob, Stuart and Kevin go around the world looking for a villain. Along the way they will find one. She tries to get them to steal Queen Elizabeth's crown. So the minions set off to follow through with her evil plan.<br/><br/>What I didn't like about the movie is that there is too much dirty humor involved. Since when do we have to be dirty to be entertained? It may fly over kids heads but most kids are smart and they will understand it soon enough if they already don't. The film also has too many pop culture references. Okay I got most of them and liked most of them as well but just too much for one movie in my opinion. I can imagine how much royalties are being paid out to the artists. Also the characters lacked development and most were unfunny and boring. Personally my favorite parts of the film were when; the minions hypnotize the guards and have them singing the song ""Hair"". And when Gru showed up at the end of the film. <br/><br/>So basically my advice is, be ready for a movie that does not hold the charm of the first two. It's not a total bust but I expected more. It seems that most sequels are made for profit only and are light on plot. By the way for those of you who don't know, Ice Age 5 is supposed to be due in theaters next year.<br/><br/>Side note: The Moon Landing scene was extremely offensive!"

Such a major let down, expected so much more.<br/><br/>It shows how they set out to find a leader and how they met Gru.

","So, what happened in the past? ""Despicable Me"" and ""Despicable Me 2"" was some of the most successful animated movies of all time. Their featured creatures ""minions"" became very popular and also gained a lot of cash. So, what to do? Of course they did a spin-off movie called ""Minions"".<br/><br/>They had the mean but kind minions (slapping each other and so on) and they had the millions of people just waiting to see a funny movie. What they did? They flushed every opportunity of a good movie down the drain.<br/><br/>Who wrote this script? The funny thing about the minions in the first two movies was that they were mean to each other in loving, small ways - slapping each other, tripping each other, sticking out their tongue... In this movie? They failed to show this. In the first two movies they were funny stupid. In this movie they were just stupid. Only twice did I smile at the minions behaviour. The rest of it was actually pure garbage.<br/><br/>The silly plot MIGHT have worked if they would have based the story on what made minions funny in the first place - slapstick humor. Now it just falls flat. Story and jokes are not that funny. I was looking forward to watch this but it really turns out to be a huge disappointment. It was a good foundation to stand on and once again greedy people fails to deliver. <br/><br/>This is truly a bad movie. The script fails the funny minions."

Their search leads them to Scarlet Overkill, the world's first-ever super- villainess.....<br/><br/>In the despicable me movies, the minions are the highlight, because, as side characters, they are not the main focus of the narrative, so while Gru is the centre, the minions provide the slapstick those movies desperately need.<br/><br/>So inevitably, the spin-off movie arrives, and also inevitably, it's not as funny as you would want it to be. It's hard to imagine, but halfway through the movie, you begin to experience minion fatigue, and you begin to realise that they are much funnier in small doses.<br/><br/>Overkill, and other secondary characters don't have the depth or the personality as Gru and others from the other movies, and she ends up sounding like a spoilt brat for the majority of her screen time.<br/><br/>There are some really funny moments though, the opening ten minutes (even though the majority of it is in the trailer), is a work of genius, and the attempt at stealing the Crown Jewels is also a highlight, it's just that the rest of the movie feels like little sketches added to a thin plot.<br/><br/>The sixties setting though is a brilliant idea, the soundtrack is hilariously genius, and Saunders steals the show as the Queen.<br/><br/>So all in all, it's a little bit of a wasted opportunity, proving that the titular characters, as hilarious as they are, a better as comic relief to Gru, but hey, there's merchandise to be sold isn't there?<br/><br/>Still just about worth seeing though."
"MartinHafer","7","2","4","25 April 2016"," Lots of fun but every time the Scarlet Overkill plot kicks in, the film slows to a grinding halt.
","In this third installment of the ""Despicable Me"" franchise, the Minions are in search of a master and the first portion of the film is a look back through history of their trying to find one. Then, the movie switches to 1968 and their music-filled quest to become sidekicks for the evil Scarlet Overkill as well as ruling the UK.<br/><br/>I enjoyed ""Minions"" and think it's a big step up from the previous installment of ""Despicable Me"". This is because in ""Despicable Me 2"", the film was great whenever the Minions were there but ground to a boring halt whenever the plot reared its ugly head. Here, however, it's mostly Minions and their antics...but once again, the film does bog down when it comes to the plot involving Scarlet Overkill...mostly because it's NOT fun. So, when it's just the Minions being goofy, the film is lovable and fun. And, this is great because mostly the film just involves the characters being funny and cute...especially in the first half hour or so. Is it as wonderful as the first film, ""Despicable Me""?

","(Rating: ☆☆ ½ out of 4)<br/><br/>This film is mildly recommended.<br/><br/>In brief: Minions has its shortcomings, but it's the other characters that never rise to their level of fun.<br/><br/>GRADE: B-<br/><br/>Those zany gibberish-speaking yellow creatures are back, this time starring in their own feature length movie. With their limitations fully acknowledged and their inability to speak the King's English as a handicap, could they have enough clout to carry their own film to stardom? The answer to that is still questionable, but Minions is lots of fun as you sit there and ponder the outcome.<br/><br/>Their slapstick antics are still pleasant and silly enough to make any moviegoer grin non- stop, even if the screenplay does quite value their worth. The film starts off very well with a short and clever history of their evolution. Narrated by Geoffrey Rush with a crisp British ironic delivery, these henchman search for a master villain to support, from dinosaurs to caveman to the Napoleonic Wars before the film settles in 1968. It is then we meet Kevin, Stuart, and Bob who are sent on a mission to find a diabolical master mind for the tribes' adulation. The trio bungle their way to a Villain-Con convention and into the clutches of the evil Scarlet Overkill and her doltish husband, Herb, whose sole goal is to get the Crown Jewels. (The story predates their loving master, Gru.) <br/><br/>Kyle Balda and Pierre Coffin direct the animated film and the latter voices the Minions to perfection. The film has a nice visual look throughout. The Minions themselves have individual traits and a variety of expressions that make these lovable characters work extremely well. As long as the film deals with the adorable threesome, their mob mentality and their relationships, the film succeeds. It's the story's slender plot that fails them and the audience.<br/><br/>As with most animated films nowadays, the CGI trumps an underdeveloped script. Minions suffers from that malady. Too often the film relies on dumb chases and an annoying soundtrack of 60's pop tunes to add to the supposed merriment. The plot meanders from one situation to the next with no real purpose, adding minor characters that do little to advance the action. The villain isn't the least bit interesting, nor is her mission. The script by Brian Lynch becomes more illogical (even for a cartoon) and less satirical and witty as it finally reaches its clumsy ending. (You actually have seen the funniest parts of this film in its trailer.)<br/><br/>Still, Minions is diverting and amusing, even if it never achieves its true potential.

"RforFilm","6","2","4","15 July 2015"," Minions proves these characters can carry a movie, but they need a more goofy surreal setup then the too safe British Caper here
","In the current age of computer animations, the mainstream audience has never been more accepting. I'm serious when I say that people love animated movies more then anything. It's not's just with Frozen becoming the highest grossing animated movie of all time and becoming a global phenomenon, but it's also with Warner Brothers, Fox, Sony, and Universal setting out their own content that's opened up the hearts of many to the art form that many adults have seen before as just kids stuff. We had a similar revolution in the late eighties when The Little Mermaid, The Land Before Time, and Who Framed Roger Rabbit all came out show showed what kind of storytelling animation was capable of. <br/><br/>Speaking of Universal Studios, no one ever expected a project like Despicable Me to have been as much of a success as it was. Those that went opening night would discover that unlike the works of something like DreamWorks's satire tone or Pixar's masterful storytelling found a new kind computer animation that we haven't seen a lot of; good old fashioned physical humor, Both of the Despicable Me movies are noted for their heavy, but funny use of slapstick, especially with the film's most iconic characters, the yellow pill-shaped minions. Given their universal appeal (no pun intended), it makes since to give them their own movie. The question most people had with Minions was, ""Can these creatures carry their own movie?"". <br/><br/>Through a great intro, we discover that the minions started a micro-cells whose only purpose was to serve the most evil on earth. They bounce around from dinosaurs to cavemen to supernatural creatures and real life historical figures, only to lose them one reason or another. After the death of Napoleon, the minions retreat into the Artic where they remain hidden for many years.<br/><br/>Tired of waiting, a tall minion named Kevin sets off to find a new master. He's joined by Stuart and Bob where they set off into the wilderness and later end up New York. They play around for a bit before ending up in Orlando, going to Villain Con hoping that their new master will be there. They get their answer in a beautifully terrifying Scarlet Overkill (played by Sandra Bullock). She takes them to her hideout in London where she describes to them their job of steeling the crown so that she can take over England. They receive gadgets from her inventor husband Herb (played by John Hamm) and set off, yet due to their silliness, take matters into their own hands.<br/><br/>The good news is that the minions can carry their own project, but they still might need Gru to do so. The problem here aren't the minions, as they are expressive creatures that get a lot of fantastic slapstick gags, but it's with the people. The big selling point to Minions is their master Scarlet Overkill who may have Sandra Bullock, but is not that interesting of a character. They needed to make her a lot funnier if she wanted to match up to Steve Carrel's level.<br/><br/>As I've said, the first half hour is filled to the core with some of the best physical gags in a comedy I've seen and sets the movie up for a big adventure. But instead, we get more of a British Caper. This wouldn't be an issue if the situation was more unique and funnier, but it's the typical spy scenario that we've seen before. Had Minions been a bit more consistent in tone, or perhaps spent the entire story just looking for a master, it might have been hilarious, but I see this more chuckle worthy then pee in your pants worthy.<br/><br/>I'll give this six minions out of ten. Chances are, a lot of kids are going to want to see this, andyea, this defiantly feels more geared towards kids then a family audience. It's strange to say that Minions plays their game a little too safe, even though they would be very likely to play something else entirely. Let's see what they learn before making Minions 2 (I know this will definitely happen)."

","Having mostly gibberish for script, this movie is a prove that visual antics and a few timely noises go a long way to induce laughter. In a throwback to classic setting and comedy, this spin-off might not be bigger than most animations in recent time, but it's still an enjoyable foray. The style of 60s world and era appropriate soundtracks enhance the atmosphere as these peculiar creatures dabble in feeble mischief.<br/><br/>Story follows three particular minions on their way to find the most dreadful villain there is. The journey takes them across the globe until they meet Scarlet Overkill (Sandra Bullock). Graphic-wise Minions is presentable. Though not all of the set pieces are magic, some of the displays, such as the rainy night or monarch architecture are still engaging and presented with nifty details.<br/><br/>The mostly simplistic nature works well, bringing visual cues and lots of squeaking mumbles. It doesn't use elaborate word plays, but this is actually an advantage as the humor is readily accessible for any casual viewer. Several of the jokes are distinctly amusing, though it doesn't fall flat even when a couple of them don't hit the high note.<br/><br/>It also boasts notable pop references of the time, from the ironic quips and its zippy tunes. The human characters can be a bit stereotypical or over-the-top, since these are mostly spoof version of action flick baddies. Its actual villain portrayal might take the name Overkill way too seriously for comical purpose.<br/><br/>The presentation for visual humor is fine and the references are easily relatable.

It's like if Seinfeld did an entire episode where Kramer just kept manically entering rooms. Where do you go when you need relief from the comic relief?<br/><br/>4/10"

So ""Minions"" is none other than a tracking shot of gags, supported by the fact that the yellow little monsters have to reach the despicable and associate with him. The most interesting element is in this archetypical need of survive and fraternization with the strongest specie: something of cruelly Darwinian is hidden behind the small banana-lovers.

","Gosh, I'm fascinated to see how critical a lot of the reviews for this movie are. Quite honestly, I don't watch animated flicks to pick them apart for how bad they are, I'm just looking for a little entertainment. I think the Minions are an incredibly cute bunch that resonate very comically with their Minionese gibberish. The film and story were OK by me, I liked the Sixties soundtrack with a little Turtles, a little Doors, a little Hendrix and a little Monkees, with a nice nod to the Beatles with the Abbey Road sequence. I have to be honest though about the celebrity voice cast, it's entirely lost on me, as I don't research who's doing what character before watching, and can't really identify them while the picture's in progress. It's an opinion I've shared before in some of my other reviews, and it wouldn't make a bit of difference to me if the characters were voiced by some unknowns looking to break into the business. The only thing that bothered me about the picture, if that's the right word, is that the Minions were on an ages long search for a villain boss. Why a villain boss, when the little, yellow corn balls are such a delight otherwise? I actually have a five year old nephew that looks just like one of these Minions, without being oval and jaundiced looking. He even talks a little bit like a Minion, which is more a function of my hearing impediment than his elocution. All I can say is, you can have some fun with this flick if you aren't as critical as some of the haters out there. Gee, lighten up a bit, it's for the kiddies."

","""Minions"" tells the story of the famous yellow guys from the very beginning until the first movies start.

However, I think producers soon noticed that there is a little problem with that because there sure is a reason why magically the plot stops before the beginning of the two World Wars. Apart from that it is a so-so animation movie, including some nice and funny moments and parts that seem a bit unnecessary. I didn't get the feeling that they just wanted to milk the cash cow but unfortunately this is not more than average.<br/><br/>All in all this film shows the difficulties of including actual history in what is supposed to be a funny animation movie for kids.

For one thing, I just didn't feel like I was laughing as much as I expected and some of the dialogues and jokes just didn't feel, well, ""Despicable Meish"" as much. It did have a solid ending I will say (most people could probably just as well guess what it is story-wise if they know the series enough). As I would agree with one other audience critic: it did lack the Despicable Me charm I will admit, which is really the only real negative to this besides one of my overall opinions: I feel like it would be hard to make a film only starring the minions (Gru stole both shows the most I would say, with even the minions not quite making second place).

It was more complex than a simple good-guy bad guy plot, not because of the plot itself, but because of the elements and settings of the movie. It moves around the world and while of course there are going to be stupid parts, if you come in expecting a movie about little yellow guys, the nice touches on the parts of the minions traveling through New York in the 1960s and the beginning with the minions evolving from organisms go a long way.

","The story is simple - too simple, in fact. Basically, the minions are looking for an evil master, because apparently that's what they've evolved to do from the beginning of time - serve the most evil master they can find. So we spend an hour and a half that we'll never get back watching them trying to find their appropriately evil master.<br/><br/>Sure. It's cute. So cute, in fact, that it comes across as almost a kiddie movie. Which is completely unlike the ""Despicable Me"" movies, which were enjoyable to people of all ages. But in those movies, the story was driven not by the minions, but by the evil Gru - who made things a lot of fun and added a touch of humanity and even emotion to the story. But basically in this, it's the minions. Yes, there's Scarlet Overkill - but did anybody really take Scarlet Overkill seriously as an evil super-villain? It's certainly possible to get a few chuckles out of the minions playing around and being silly - but it wears pretty thin after about the first 15 minutes or so, without any ""meat"" to go along with it.<br/><br/>I confess that this finally put me into a stupor and I nodded off for a little bit -
 meaning that I actually missed how it was that the minions managed to save England. And I didn't really care. I'm just glad that I did wake up in time to see the best part of the movie - when the minions finally find their true master - the young Gru! (4/10)"

The opening sequence about their evolution and ongoing search for an evil overload was imaginative filler, but once the main story took over, the movie degenerated into a series of repetitious sight gags, only some of which were particularly funny (such as the minions riding the Queen's corgis). Neither Sandra Bullock's ""Scarlett Overkill"" nor Jon Hamm's ""Herb Overkill"", the principal speaking characters, added much to the story and I quickly grew tired of the Minion gibberish/language. Comedy may be the most subjective of genres, so this is especially ""IMO"" but, unlike ""Despicable Me"" (2010), I didn't find ""Minions"" to be either particularly humorous or particularly entertaining (never-the-less, it made a boatload of money, so others must have)."

","This standalone film follows the Minions, who were first seen in 'Despicable Me'. We see how they have been around since the time of the dinosaurs, always trying to find the most evil beings to serve and then accidentally kill! Eventually they can find nobody to serve and as the centuries pass they fall into a depression. One day Minion Kevin decides to do something about it; he, along with sidekicks Stuart and Bob set off to find a new evil master to serve. They find themselves in New York in 1968; there they hear that Villain-con is taking place in Orlando. They make their way there and find themselves working for top villain Scarlet Overkill. She has plans to take over England; the first stage is to get the Minions to steal the crown not surprisingly things don't go quite as Scarlet hoped and then the Minions are in her sights.<br/><br/>The little yellow minions were one of the highlights of the' Despicable Me' films so it isn't a surprise that they got their own film. The main story isn't particularly original but that isn't too much of a problem as it is just an excuse to put the minions in a variety of amusing situations where all their attempts to help their new mistress lead her to think they are actually working against her. Most of these set pieces are pretty funny in a way that should amuse children of all ages and adults who enjoy slapstick silliness. The '60s setting provides a good excuse to incorporate music of the era; sometimes sung in the minions' gibberish! The story ends nicely in a way that links into 'Despicable Me'. The animation is impressive with good character designs and detailed backgrounds. Overall I'd say this was a lot of fun and would recommend it even if it isn't quite up to the quality of 'Despicable Me' it is very silly but it is also a lot of fun."

Its entertaining and worth watching. Minions is directed by Pierre Coffin and Kyle Balda. The directors have done a satisfactory jobs in creating a good prequel/spin off Minions Movie. Their creative vision of crafting those awesome and amazing little Minions is amazing. The performances are good. Pierre Coffin as the Minions is great. The character of Sandra Bullock as Scarlett Overkill is OK, but not up too the mark, somehow it misses the perfection mark. Michael Keaton and Geoffrey Rush as supporting characters were OK, and the rest of the cast characters were good but sidelined.<br/><br/>Minions has lots of flaws too. The story plot structure is bad, the script and screenplay seems to be underwhelming at certain times and there is no strong support to the movie from the story point of view. There are lots of unnecessary and underdeveloped characters, especially the character of Scarlett Overkill (Sandra Bullock) is very under utilized and does not feel too good. The story plot line is somewhat weak, its like anything is happening anytime without any proper effect.<br/><br/>Minions are delight to watch.

","This movie takes the best feature of the movies Despicable Me (2010) and Despicable Me 2 (2013) and turns it into its own feature filmsthe minions! This movie take place BG—that is ""before Gru."" We learn that minions are creatures whose only satisfaction is to serve the evilest villains on earth. We see that since the dawn of time, the minions have served the worst villains from cavemen to Dracula—albeit not to the greatest success. The minions fall on dark times, where they have no villain to serve. This causes the entire minion civilization to fall into a great depression, until one day, the minion Kevin decides to set off on a quest to find the most evil villain on earth for the minions to serve. Kevin begins his quest by finding his way to Villain-Con, a convention for all of the world's super villains. It ends up that Kevin and his two apprentices Stuart and Bob fall under the employment of Scarlett Overkill, the world's first female Super-villain. Together they plot to steal the crown of the Queen of England, and the adventure unfolds. This movie is non-stop laughs from the Universal Pictures presents screen right to the Illumination Entertainment logo after the end credits roll. Much of the movie takes place in the minion language (which while incomprehensible borrows words from French, Spanish and Italian; and those are just the languages I detected). Still without understanding exactly what the minions are saying you can understand the messages conveyed, particularly when they are mocking each other for failing—some of the funniest scenes of the movie. For the third movie in a franchise this movie lives up to the first two films. A wise move to take a lovable, adorable, and hysterical character and spin off it's own film."

","Minions is a mediocre film. It has a decent plot, but the film completely wastes any potential it could've had. The problem I had with it is that the film revolves around a side character that was fun in small doses, but annoying in long ones. For example, the first Despicable Me film was a great flick. It had a good plot, good characters, and good writing. The minions were in it, but they were funny and only shown in short bits. However, here, they're on the screen all the time and the jokes with them aren't really all that funny. Overall, this film is great for kids, but adults may want to stray away from it."

"Animated_Antic","5","0","0","27 June 2017"," A very disappointing and mostly unfunny spin-off movie.
","A movie series has to be really careful when it makes its comic relief the main characters of a film because most of the time when a movie attempts to do this, it usually badly backfires. One notable example was Pixar's ""Cars 2."" It tried to make the comic relief Mater the main character and it really badly backfired. Now Illumination is giving the Minions from the highly entertaining ""Despicable Me"" series their own film, and sadly is doesn't work either. It's not awful, but I didn't particularly enjoy it. I don't exactly know what went wrong here, but I'll try my best to say what happened.<br/><br/>The film did start off with promise. It started with a highly entertaining showing the troubled history of the Minions trying to have a particular evil boss, and failing. They kill off every master they come across, including a T-Rex, a caveman, the ancient Egyptians, Dracula, even Napoleon. Eventually, the Minions decide to isolate themselves in Antarctica and start living a happy life down at the bottom of the world. Years go by, and the Minions get depressed. However, three brave Minions named Kevin, Bob and Stuart start feeling that they should have a boss and decide to leave the freezing climates and head North. They eventually end up in 1968 New York City and start to look for a boss. They eventually come across an ad for the most evil villain in the world at the time, Scarlett Overkill (Sandra Bullock) and head to Orlando to work for her. They eventually get chosen and Overkill and her husband Herb (Jon Hamm) reveals her next evil scheme which is to try to steal the crown of Queen Elizabeth (Jennifer Saunders) and the rest of the movie is basically indescribable chaos.<br/><br/>The biggest problem with the movie is the fact that the movie is not very funny. Don't get me wrong though, the movie does have humorous moments including the aforementioned opening scene and a pretty hilarious scene involving a crazy family played humorously by Michael Keaton and Allison Janney. Aside from those two moments, I was hoping something funny would occur, but nothing really made me laugh. This is where I realized that the movie was lacking something. It was lacking the other characters that made the ""Despicable Me"" series work. It needed characters like Gru, Dr. Nefario, Lucy, the girls, Gru's mother. The newer characters just weren't that funny or interesting. I also thought Scarlet Overkill wasn't that evil especially with her extremely weak crime that she's committing. The film doesn't even really have that much of a story. I honestly don't know what it was going for and felt like it was just there to make jokes which was the most likely reason. <br/><br/>""Minions"" was a real disappointment. It has some humorous moments, but not a lot of them. It just doesn't really have the charm that the ""Despicable Me"" movies were so good at capturing. It's honestly a harmless waste of time for very young kids, but it's certainly not something for the whole family."

","Despicable Me was a pretty good film. It was funny, kids-friendly and had a very talented voice cast. It's sequel was pretty bad. This? This officially ruined the franchise. There was a little bit of hope after Despicable Me 2, but we all know the next one is going to be terrible. The first few scenes were pretty funny, and featured great narration by Jeffrey Rush (Captain Barbossa). But it all goes downhill after that. The villain, Scarlett Overkill, is flat, clichéd and her one-liners are terrible. You just start missing Gru. I mean, the minions are funny, but the franchise needs Steve Carell. It needs all the human characters from the first one. And most of the humour just isn't funny. Some of it's good, but the rest is just bad humour.

","Do you like 'Teen Titans Go!'? Then this Movie is for YOU! No but in all seriousness if you wanted a bunch of yellow guys running around killing their bosses and not caring that they killed their bosses. No they just care because without a boss they are killed and since these characters come and die than I can't care about any of them to feel sorry when they die. Their not even cute here either they are constantly assholes and laughing at each other when one is harmed and just really, REALLY ANNOYING! However, to be fair they aren't the ONLY thing wrong with this Movie the Human Character's let's talk about Herb, Scarlet's Husband... Ohh Wait you didn't know she had a husband? Well he's too forgettable and useless for the trailer. Scarlet doesn't have enough screen time she seems like she is Bi Polar or something she wanted to be Queen since she was a little girl but we don't see any of that. The most we see is her drawing when she was 5. Instead of the STUPID 3 Little Pigs story, Why not a story of her drawing it and showing it to her mom who ripped it up and laughed at her or her crying when her mom told her she could never be a princess. We don't get a reason as to why she hates the Minions, She just is nice to them then Herb leaves and she hates them and it wasn't even like just her pretending for him or anything. Also, Queen Elizabeth is in this Movie (for some reason) and nearly everyone their is a British Stereotype (You know messed up teeth, drinking tea, etc.) and the rest are other stereotypes. This Movie doesn't have any quite moments it Confuses LOUD with funny worse than TTG! (at least that's only 11 mins) most of that is Gibberish but Scarlet is REALLY LOUD as well. However I do like a few things with this Movie like Herb's inventions A Lava Lamp Gun that literally shoots Lava!, Hypnotic Hat, and A Gadget that turns you into Inspector Gadget (ok that one isn't original). The Chase Scene where they are trying to steal Queen Elizabeth's Crown and use those inventions, and Gru's Cameo at the end. Seriously though if you liked the Minions in Despicable Me than I doubt if you will here. What else do I have to say?... ""BANANA!""<br/><br/>~Ryan_Ech0"

","When I heard that this movie is popular for adults not only children, I didn't know the reason. However, after I finished watching it, I understand why this is popular among people in wide age. The story is so simple that everyone including children can understand, but there are many elements make this movie interesting, for example dreams, hopes, friendship, loves, funny, and so on. Minions have dreams to find the worst and the strongest boss. They always do their best to make their dreams come true, and they try to get over many problems while their journey. The interesting thing I think is that we cannot understand the language minions speak hardly. Some parts of their speaking sounds like English, but others are just sounds we can expect that is their language. But we can understand what they mean as if we can know their language in each situation from their facial expression and tone of voice. That is important elements to make this movie interesting and funny. I'd like to recommend all people in all ages, not only family accompanying small children.

After falling foul of their last master, the Minions end up masterless, living in a cave and leading a pointless existence. Then three Minions - Kevin, Stuart and Bob - set out to find the Minions a master.<br/><br/>Reasonably good fun.

","There's a lot of hate for this movie here, but overall I really enjoyed it. Making a movie about characters that talk in gibberish and were mainly designed for slapstick gags in a different film is not easy, but they created a whole mythology for the things (I always figured they were invented by Despicable Me's protagonist) and manage to build a story around them. And it has a lot of the same silly humor of the original films.<br/><br/>I'd say it was really very enjoyable for about an hour before it got away from the writers. The last half hour is hectic and doesn't make much sense, including things like a big chase scene that comes out of left field. It's a lot of noise lacking the cleverness of the first hour.<br/><br/>Even that last half hour though isn't bad, it's just weak, and I say, ignore the haters and take a look for yourself."

","I think movies like this are always going to be a bit of a risk. I guess there's a certain amount of risk to any film, but I think more-so with spin-offs. Usually I think to myself when I hear about films like this is ""How are they going to make a film entirely about side characters?"". I thought the same about Penguins of Madagascar. Penguins wasn't a brilliant film, but it was enjoyable and the makers done a good job of making a feature from ""bit part"" characters. Well, I think the makers of Minions done a similarly good job here in making a feature about Gru's little henchmen as it's a pretty enjoyable movie.<br/><br/>I liked the story line they worked with for the movie with it posing the questions ""Who are the Minions & how did the Minions come to be?"". They went with the Evolution angle, Minions style, showing them how they first came into existence, how they evolved over millions & millions of years, and how they only want to serve the ultimate villain. The story obviously expands as we fast-forward a good few millenia to 1968, where Bob, Stuart, & Kevin go off to search for their tribes newest ultimate villain (ultimately ending up with the obvious towards the end).<br/><br/>Now, I personally enjoyed the film. It was pretty funny (though not hysterical), it was well animated, and the voice cast all done a good job. I liked the characters (especially the Nelson family), and the more subtle jokes that were shown e.g. the filming of the moon landing. Was it ultimately as good as the Despicable Me films? No, and I think the Minions will always be better as side characters, but this is still a good film in it's own right.<br/><br/>Minions isn't a kids movie either...it's a family film, and I think it's a film that will be generally enjoyed by audiences of all ages. I'm almost 42 and I enjoyed it.<br/><br/>Oh, as a side note to those who complained about how there's ""no black characters"". Grow up, don't be pathetic, and stop continually playing the race card.

We know they ended up in modern times with Gru, but who did they attach themselves to during older historic times? <br/><br/>A good part of this story occurs in 1968. They are in New York and watching a TV commercial that is advertising a convention of crooks in Orlando. So they hitch a ride with a family going there, on the way stopping to rob a bank. <br/><br/>In Orlando they meet the best thief (voiced by Sandra Bullock) who recruits the Minions to go to London with her and steal the British Crown.<br/><br/>That leads to a number of things that British audiences probably will be horrified by, considering their reverence for the Crown and the Queen.

","When do the minions really began their place in history? Definitely longer than the human species. Ever since the beginning of time, minions have always wanted to serve the baddest, meanest villain around. Over centuries through history, they have come to find serving humans is what they find most enjoyable.<br/><br/>But it was during the time of Napoleon, things did not go quite as planned, and the minions were driven into isolation and started a new life in the Antarctica. The minions would come to grow restless over the years with no purpose in life, but it was to be one minion Kevin who decided to do something. He would be joined by the musically-inclined Minion Stuart who had no idea what he was joining in for, and the young and inexperienced Bob, and the trio would come to find their journey take them to 1968's New York City.<br/><br/>After trying to blend into their new surroundings, the trio came to find themselves at a departmental store and spent the night there. They would come across a television advertisement advertising Villain- Con, a convention for villains and supervillains in Orlando. That got them eventually hitchhiking a ride with a family of villains called the Nelsons who were also heading there, and the Nelsons were to be impressed at their skills. At the Villain-Con, the Minions would come to meet the first female supervillain Scarlett Overkill (Sandra Bullock) and they did enough to impress her, leading Scarlett to send them over to England with her, where the Minions would also come to meet her husband Herb (Jon Hamm).<br/><br/>It was in England where the Minions came to know what they needed to do. Scarlett came to tell the Minions of the plan to steal the Queen's crown jewels, and gave them the tools needed to be successful in their heist. But what the Minions came to attempt to do would soon be heavily publicised, and the whole of Britain would come to be heavily destabilised for a few days.<br/><br/>While much like the two Despicable Me films, the comedic elements were there with the Minions around, but at the same time, the Minions could not quite hold it in their very own film of how they would come to find their eventual owner. Still, what made this enjoyable like the human characters in Scarlett and Herb. But it definitely takes the viewers on a journey of how the Minions came to settle for the owner we would see in the two Despicable Me films."

","My expectations were very low for this. It came and passed in the theaters and I didn't see it. I only rented a DVD at a friend's request. I was prepared for the worst and received a pleasant surprise: the most amusing, fun cartoon of the year.<br/><br/>This is an absurd cartoon with basically no plot and every 60's reference not previously hogged by Men in Black 3, and yet it is fun to behold. It has slap-stick, pop-references, political-references, and plain- out likable characters.<br/><br/>The movie starts so-so, mediocre. But by the time they are hitch- hiking to villain-convention, the movie suddenly gets really creative and goes full-speed ahead with funny moments and interchanges. What the plot lacks in structure it more than makes up for in pacing. For me the best part of the movie is the late-1st Act to the 2nd Act. It's one of those movies that progressively gets better as time goes on... until it jumps the shark. BIG TIME. By the 3rd Act the movie manages to over-step my BS-limit, which is a shame. By the climax the movie strangely goes full-circle back the mediocrity and staleness of the beginning.<br/><br/>But man, that 1st-to-2nd Act was awesome. The characters are very likable - mind you I'm not talking about the minions, but the secondary characters. Scarlet was so-so, pretty good but not as awesome as 'VECTOR!', her husband though, was I thought perfectly done, it's so weird how for all the couple's insanity, they still have a very healthy, loving, supportive relationship. Most villain- couples break in to bickering when things go wrong, whereas these two actually stick with each other to face their arbitrary, nonsensical enmity with the minions. Also, I hold that the family that picks the minions up hitch-hiking has got to be the best scene of the movie.<br/><br/>The problem is really that the ending is contrived, and the 60's- references are heavy-handed and wear old after the first 5 minutes. Also, the plot has no structure.<br/><br/>Upon the end of this movie, it strikes me that this is a perfect prequel. In every way. It is very much in line with the tone and message of Despicable Me 1, without relying on pandering with cross-references. There are almost no references to the future films. Everything happening is more or less self- contained within this film, and sets up the original only in tone and humor --- the polar opposite of what Lucas did with the Star Wars Prequels. The characters are just as strong as the depth achieved in Gru's in the original. The minions are still rather blank, the extras are still shallow stereotypes. But the supporting characters are beautifully scripted and performed -- just like Despicable Me's strengths and weaknesses. The plot is still rather loose, the dark-to-slapstick-to-dark humor is still strong as ever.<br/><br/>I always felt that Despicable Me 2 was crap. Still do. In Despicable Me 2, the plot was more cohesive -- and incredibly boring and generic. The humor lacked punch in every way. The ending was lame and over-blown. The Characters were flat.<br/><br/>Minions is rather a step back to what worked, they fixed the problems of DM2 and returned to the strengths of the first one. Looking at the strengths of Minions, it is identical to that of Despicable Me, but with a different plot and different characters. If you called this film stupid, you'd be right, but that's not the point. What matters is: how is the stupidity delivered? In 'Minions', the absurdity is shamelessly embraced and executed very cleverly in non-generic ways. Whoever wrote this was a very intelligent and very twisted individual.<br/><br/>This is a film that is bat-guano insane, completely pointless, and written by a genius. Not good, but by God do I RESPECT it.<br/><br/>If you're an adult looking for an intelligently mindless 90 minutes, I recommend no better film. It is also good for kids, oddly enough, my 6-yo brother was jumping on the couch in excitement during the high points, and showed genuine concern during the low-points. Quite a balancing act, to entertain two completely different ages for completely different reasons with the same optimal result. I'm not sure why everyone hates this movie - I blame the marketing- over- saturation; it gave people the wrong expectations. So if you watch this... do yourself a favor and keep an open mind."

","Undeniably one of the funniest aspects of the Despicable Me films was the small yellow henchmen called the minions. One might wonder how best to make the most of this, given that the normal route would be to give them a spin off film – but the challenge would be to construct a film around small yellow creatures which speak in gibberish. This challenge remains, because with this film it feels a lot like they simply decided that if the minions stay themselves and remain funny, then probably few people will care that the plot is a mess.<br/><br/>And it is a mess, with characters all over the place, no meaningful throughline, and generally the thinnest excuse for the setpieces. Of course, it is still fun thanks to the minions being themselves, and when this is happening the film is absolutely fine. The human characters are the problem though, because they are weak – mostly just devices to make things happen. Although they are voiced by some very big names, mostly the cast do very little of value, and occasionally seem out of place or poorly used. However when the main three are doing their thing, the film is funny, fast, and enjoyable – just a shame that the actual frame it all happens within is so weak.<br/><br/>Despite this, it does have enough silliness and fun to get by, so I forgave it the mess of the plot and just enjoyed the trio being daft, which to be fair is probably what the makers were banking on."

"breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","6","0","0","29 August 2015"," A fun prequel that creates more questions than answers
","Stories can be told in any direction and when it comes to movies, studios love to make franchises involving sequels and prequels. Despicable Me (2010) was a surprise hit that had intelligent writing, amiable main characters, plenty of comedy and heartwarming character development. When Despicable Me 2 (2013) came out, it not only continued its success financially but also critically by preserving the elements that worked in the initial installment. Of both films the character that became the official mascot of the series was the minion; the yellow, googly eyed, muddle mouthed, squishy, denim overall wearing pills that followed Gru until the ends of the Earth for him to accomplish his mission to be the greatest villain mastermind. It is because they became so popular that a film revolving entirely around them was made. Thus this prequel serves as the back story to how the minions got to the point of Despicable Me (2010). The question is, does it serve its purpose - kind of but not entirely.<br/><br/>The plot to this prequel is actually a bit convoluted. Since the beginning of time minions have roamed the earth looking for a bigger and badder antagonist to follow. After trying through multiple time periods and failing miserably, the minions finally go into isolation. Over time their life becomes stagnant and three minions named Kevin, Bob and Stuart (Pierre Coffin) decide to go out into the world and find their groupies an evil leader to follow. On their travels they see an add for VillianCon - an underground society where evil geniuses around the world come together to celebrate being bad. There the trio find Scarlett Overkill (Sandra Bullock), an outlandish hyper-stylized fem-fatale who has the rights of being the first female villain. For this feature, Brian Lynch (Puss in Boots (2011)& Hop (2011)) served as the screenwriter and seems appropriate since Puss in Boots (2011) was also a prequel film to that of Shrek (2001). However even with this credit given, there's a lot that isn't answered.<br/><br/>The voice acting performed by Pierre Coffin and Sandra Bullock are the highlights in the acting. There are other voice appearances throughout like Jon Hamm playing Scarlett's boyfriend, Michael Keaton as a rogue father of a crime family and Geoffrey Rush as the narrator of the story. Yet none of the other characters are that important because they do not appear in Despicable Me (2010) or Despicable Me 2 (2013); it's rather disappointing. Animation and direction is also a plus. Kyle Balda (Co- Director of The Lorax (2012)) took full reigns of the project and it is competent. The lead character animator credit belongs to Christophe Delisle who has also worked on The Lorax (2012) and Despicable Me 2 (2013). Delisle's animation is smooth, colorful and is comical when it needs to be. Another interesting thing to take note of is the gradual alterations that have been given to Kevin, Stuart and Bob. There's a difference in their designs seeing them from Despicable Me (2010) to now. Possibly the most notable change is that Bob isn't so wide, he's been thinned down some.<br/><br/>For writing other than the main plot, there are several parts that don't make a whole lot of sense. For one, are minions immortal? Besides surviving some of the most hostile environments, did anyone else notice that they haven't aged since they came onto the screen? They lived from the dinosaur age, medieval times to mid 20th century. There's not even a real explanation to where they came from. Another big question are historical records. If minions have existed for this long in time, just how exactly do people in later times not know who they are? Surely someone must have documented such indestructible and loyal creatures. Then there's the whole separate issue of the humans in this particular universe. Unfortunately for England, London was the choice for setting and some of what is displayed is overly exaggerated. The UK police have car chases while pouring hot cups of tea - alright. The whole country of England hands over their entire kingdom to anyone who wears the crown - ummm yeah. I don't think the humans from Despicable Me (2010) or Despicable Me 2 (2013) were this silly.<br/><br/>The human character reactions to what the minions say on screen is also half and half. Sometimes they look like they understand and other times not. This too goes for the audiences' reactions. This feature unfortunately suffers from taking a supporting character and making it a main character. Sometimes it's not a good idea, especially if you can't grasp their language. Remember The Star Wars Holiday Special (1978)? Yeah it's not as bad as that but same concept. Lucky for us the minion- ese language consists of various common words so it's not as tough as understanding wookies. The music was adequate for the film. Series composer Heitor Pereira returns and maintains the same feeling of the music although there is no main theme. Adding to that are a bunch of old school soundtrack songs from popular English rock bands during the late 1960s such as The Rolling Stones, The Beatles, The Monkeys and others. It's appropriate for the setting.<br/><br/>The voice-acting is fine, the animation looks better than ever and the music works. Honestly for a prequel it is not as well crafted as Despicable Me (2010) or its sequel. Even though it nicely ties in the events that took place before the minions met Gru, it leaves a lot of big questions in its place. Those minions are lucky they're so likable because otherwise it would not have been as enjoyable even at the most minimal level."

The movie narrated by Geoffrey Rush begins with the introduction of the Minions and a recap of how they are always in search of villains to serve. But this time they have been without a master for three years. So three Minions—leader Kevin, Stuart and Bob set out to take boredom out of their lives. Do they succeed? They reach New York where a villains' conference is being held. On learning that Scarlet Overkill is the biggest super villain these days, they are excited and take part in a competition where the winner gets to be her henchmen. On winning the competition they are assigned a task to steal the Queen of England's throne or face death. <br/><br/>Minions are a crazy phenomenon these days. They are cute but this time they are not funny. All you get is overloads of cuteness. But apart from a few scenes, is the movie worth a watch? Well the movie will leave kids entertained and rolling with laughter as was evident in the theatre. It has a simple story line which is easy for them to comprehend. But if you do not go bananas on seeing minions, I think you can give it a miss."
"Filvies144","3","0","0","5 August 2015"," Watch Inside out, not dull, horrible, cheap, lazy, unfunny, heart lacking cash in
","Now I really liked the Despicable me movies, but now that the minions got their own movie, lets take a look. <br/><br/>First off, I'd like to say that this film can be predictable at times and a bit fast paced, and the film gets really dull. Most of the jokes are cheap too. Like, the only chuckle worthy and best jokes are in the trailers. The way how the 3 minions are trying to find a villain for a leader makes no sense because since the other bosses weren't evil or in-fact animals, there's no reason why they should find a villain if their fine with a bear being their leader. Plus this film lacks heart. There's isn't any real drama or heartwarming moments unlike Inside Out, which has them. The best parts of the movie were the first 30 minutes of it, which is probably the only redeemer other than that great music that brings a feel to the 60s. But this story is seriously pitiful.<br/><br/>The animation looks pretty good like the backgrounds are great, but the character design is decent but very simplistic as always., but as for the characters, the minions are extremely cute,(Bob is my favorite, he's so cute!)but one dimensional. Scarlet feels too over the top and forgettable/bland at the same time, and the rest of the human characters are forgettable. Like the actor Michael Kenton was totally wasted playing a minor character whose only purpose is to bring the Minions to the Villain con.<br/><br/>So bottom line: This film is a lazy cash in and the D me films were better. The story is lazy, lacks heart, and is boring and unfunny. The animation does look good, but the characters are one dimensional/ My recommendation is: If you want to watch it just rent it. Inside out is better than this. Adults should watch inside out, avoid this. It's only amusing to 6 year olds. <br/><br/>3/10"

","I can highlight of this film is an extraordinary animation, the technology used in this film is fascinating, the colors, effects and also carries hand the great music. Each character and landscapes and locations are wonderful. I also want to emphasize the original ideas that were used in the movie, the plot twists and resolution of conflicts for me were quite interesting. OK! but the movie is full of completely stupid jokes, coupled with the dumb language of Minions. This is a clear example that is directed to young audiences, even for adults and adolescents, the movie can be very silly. The Minions are made to cause tenderness and pleasure to everyone, but the dose of these characters can be too. Spanish dubbing in this movie were very bad, especially Ricky Martin and Thalia was not the best choice and this may be due to the script. The human characters were not featured in the best way. And summarizing the plot is very simple, not complex and does not have moments of tension, and the biggest mistake for me was that there was no message, nothing deep in the plot of the movie, which is necessary in these animated films, because otherwise it does not leave you anything this film. 6.1/10."

"nairtejas","4","5","16","11 July 2015"," Lose Emotions. ♦ 40%
","Adults generally relate with the Despicable Me franchise not because of the evil factor, but because of the emotional connect that is present in its oddball narratives. In Minions, however, there is a gaping lack of emotions.<br/><br/>Three minions are on a quest to find a fitting, evil master for its tribe who, we are told, have been around since the dawn of the time. They were friends with dinosaurs and still there was no mention about them in Jurassic Park (1993). In the year 1968, the trio go to the Big Apple and then to the English capital, after having seemingly found their master, a female antagonist (Bullock). Then the plot is more or less about her evil plan.<br/><br/>One will not feel touched with the things that happen in the film, most of which are straight mindless. While there are too many factors that betray the film of originality, even the minions fail to deliver. The sequels (2010 and 2013) are good, relatable films that are high on humor. But in here, the humor is all situational and these are boring situations that I am talking about. <br/><br/>Also goes a bit annoying towards the end with that save the world crap. As is apparent from the sequels, minions are again only a small part of the film. The duel between good and evil is also badly handled as the climax ends the charade with a delightful surprise.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: Minions is a perfect example of a studio that has run out of ideas and is only making films to make some moolah out of ""gibberish.""<br/><br/>VERDICT: 3 stars out of 10. ONLY for kids.<br/><br/>Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES"
"LincolnSixEko","4","3","9","14 July 2015"," Clearly cashing in on the Minion craze
","The movie starts out with the minions trying to find their perfect evil master- something the preview has already shown us...Except this lasts for about 20 minutes before the movie actually gets going to the ""plot"". <br/><br/>Second thing i didn't like was that the antagonist wants the queen's crown, to be respected and rule the land- OK thats fine and all, but she has all these cool weapons, can fly, has armor, but yet she holds a contest for all the villains to get it for her instead because...I'm not sure why. Supposedly she's the most notorious villain there is. Instead she comes off as a very bland, one dimensional character and while i enjoy Sandra Bullock's films she does absolutely nothing to bring any life to this character at all. She clearly shouldn't have been cast for the role- or any other voice work- in my opinion. <br/><br/>Secondly, while i do like the music in the film (classic rock), it just seems shoehorned in to cater to the parents/grandparents and for only that reason. There's also a reference to the Beatles which was just embarrassing and eye rolling to say the least. <br/><br/>Finally, the antagonist can get smashed by a rather large chandelier, smashed into buildings, and blown up...but cannot withstand...ice??!! Yup...ice. Seems like the writers needed something to tack on at the end that would tie directly to the first Despicable Me film, (this IS a prequel after all), and so they chose ice. Its not even a big, heaping pile of ice either. <br/><br/>On top of that kids in the theater weren't laughing all that much (at the scenes that were clearly made FOR kids to laugh). However most people clapped at the end of the film. Whether its because it was a movie they enjoyed or just glad it was over is debatable. <br/><br/>4/10"

","A group of adult friends watched this movie on the evening of Christmas day and found it to be very disappointing. One friend commented that we had sunk to a new low. Only a couple of times did it cause a trickle of laughter, mainly to be polite to the person who supplied the DVD. We have enjoyed animated movies such as Big Hero 6, How to train your Dragon, Frozen, Penguins of Madagascar,and Maleficent and always look forward to a new animation that we can watch with our grandchildren. If we had taken them to a movie theater, it would have been a waste of good money.The actors who supplied the voices must have had a treat, not having to memorize (read) any lines, as 90% of the movie was a mumble jumble of a made up language, basically causing the viewer to guess at the gist of the story. I would not recommend this movie to any age group."

","When are these spin-off movies gonna end? OMG this is the first time and hopefully the only time i say this, i hate Minions.<br/><br/>When people said Dispeciable Me movies are a hit because of minions, i did not agree and with this movie my argument just stands tall.<br/><br/>They came out of no where in Dispecable Me and stole our hearts. And i think that is where they should have stayed. For instance, you go to a 7-course meal and don't just wish you had more of the cup cakes? and when you have more of them and nothing else you don't want to eat anymore, that is this movie in one line.<br/><br/>Minions with their mannerism and slapstick gave us a real treat in the first two movies, in this they are just plain annoying. If you guys have seen the trailer then that's it. That is all the laugh you will get out of this movie. I was really surprised by that, i thought trailers were supposed to be a sneak peek into the fun adventure we were expecting, not in this movie.<br/><br/>Iam OK with the minion language, it is funny as long as you have some actions showing what they actually mean, but here they just talk in the Gibberish and every minion laugh (The Coronation scene). I mean what is that all about? i paid money to watch the movie and don't even understand the language in which the joke was said? How is that fair.<br/><br/>The movie lacks any purpose at all. If you are making a prequel of how minions are with Gru, i just guess the movie could have started with Gru and how they bond, but it choose another villain for the heck of it and ended up making minions a hero? Sounds confusing, minions are adorable but they are henchmen for an evil guy and hence they are evil, why would the movie want them to be proclaimed Hero, no idea. So if the minions are working for another villain isn't it a rehash of despicable movie? It shouldn't have been scripted like that Aside that fact, i wanted to see some fun minion moments, again that was missing. Nothing even made me chuckle and as the movie went on and on, i started hating them. Making the Universal music in Minionese, not cool at all but i know what was into, still to bore with the same thing over and over is not fun.<br/><br/>Movie lacks story, fun, logic and conviction. If you just want to watch for Kevin and Bob just go for it, otherwise don't even bother."

","I recently watched Minions with my family. I figured minions would be similar to Despicable me. Sadly I was completely wrong. For an adult the Minions movie might be hilarious, however, I found that it is way too violent for children. They definitely pushed the envelope with the PG rating. This movie includes scenes such as a bank robbery where children assist, children playing with weapons in the back of a vehicle, and during the robbery get away one minion fires a rocket launcher at a police officer. Although an adult might think these scenes are funny, the influence they have on children could be damaging. Keep in mind what children are watching influences what they do. I kept thinking the movie would get better and yet again I was mistaken. I ended up walking out of the theater with my family when the character Scarlet Overkill said, ""This is not a coronation this is an execution."" I have a 7 year old and 4 year old. I watched Despicable Me (1&2) prior to allowing our children to view the movie and the minimal make believe violence in the movie was tolerable. In good conscience I could not allow my children to view what I've taught them is not OK."
"matthewssilverhammer","3","4","14","17 July 2015"," Obnoxious and Boring
","Are we in the midst of a terrible new trend? In 2014, Penguins of Madagascar provided a funny, if generic, spin-off of the popular Madagascar films, which focused on the comic relief side-penguins. This year, there's Minions, which is similar to Penguins on the surface, but with none of the decent humor or narrative sense. It could've been mindlessly entertaining, but full of clichéd and unfunny jokes, it's instead annoyingly tedious. It's honestly astonishing how something so obnoxious can also be so boring, and feel like it would never end. The minions from Despicable Me are inarguably the best aspect of the uber-popular franchise. However, sometimes a decent side-item isn't enough to replace an entire meal. There's not a single character to invest in here, as we barely get to know the new characters, and the minions have no discernible, individual personalities. Not that these things are absolute necessities for kids entertainment; just provide more than a dull story and played-out comedy to keep people from focusing on the lack of logic anywhere (i.e. why is no one in this very real 1960s setting wondering who these little yellow dudes are?). Even the jokes and surprises failed as they were forced on us through the ever-ubiquitous marketing campaign. Honestly, none of this really matters; if you're a parent, you will be (or already were) inevitably dragged to this. That's a shame, since I think kids and families deserve better than clichéd story beats, bright colors, 3D tricks, and the basest of humor (farts, pain, underwear). For a fully entertaining family-movie night, just give Inside Out a (second) look."
"StevePulaski","4","4","14","13 July 2015"," An appetizer simply cannot serve as the main dish
","Watching ""Minions,"" the latest installment in the ""Despicable Me"" franchise, is like going to the finest restaurant in town and expecting an overpriced appetizer to fill you up so much so that a main course isn't even necessary. The Minions, the now-ubiquitous secondary characters from the aforementioned franchise, played second banana (no pun intended) to supervillain Gru and other characters, and while they provided for an cute, quickwitted diversion, forcing them into the forefront to maintain a feature-length spotlight was no doubt a daunting task for the writers and directors of this project. There's little chance that five years ago, a spin off film of these small, yellow, pill-like creature would've even been a thought in an animator's mind.<br/><br/>""Minions"" was a movie coming from a mile away. ""Despicable Me 2"" hinted at its inevitable existence early on, with its teaser trailer focusing entirely on the creatures and carrying the characters over to the forefront of the film's marketing campaign. Furthermore, the amount of Minion merchandise, with everything from stuffed animals, Lego knockoffs, and Tic-Tacs being made in celebration of the film, comes close to the sickening level of franchising that Pixar's ""Cars"" did. While even a hardened cynic would find it difficult not to at least crack a smile at the cuteness and insane likability of these little creatures, a ninety-minute affair with these rascals proves to be a muchness.<br/><br/>The prelude to the film, most of which included in the theatrical trailer, bears some of the funniest, most relevant humor of the entire film. We see how Minions have inhabited the planet long before human beings, with one goal in mind - ""serve the most despicable master they could find."" The Minions worked for everyone, be it Dracula, a Tyrannosaurus Rex, Egyptian Pharaohs, and even Napoleon, all of whom wound up tragically killed at the fault of the Minions. Finally, after unintentionally killing their last master, the Minions set up their village in Antarctica, serving nobody else but themselves. This works for a little while, but the Minions gradually become aimless and disinterested in life, rapidly losing their ability to function.<br/><br/>One brave Minion, Kevin (voiced by co-director Pierre Coffin, as all the Minion characters are), stands before the Minions to see who, if any, will venture out to unknown parts to return with a master that all the Minions can serve. When the roly-poly rebel Stuart is selected, in addition to the sweet and simple Bob, the trio set out to find their master, eventually getting word of a large gathering of villains at ""Villain-Con,"" an annual convention. They hear of Scarlet Overkill (Sandra Bullock), the evilest female supervillain in all the land, and make it their prime mission to serve her and all her needs upon visiting the convention.<br/><br/>When you're in the company of sweet, primitive little yellow cylinders that bask in their own naive ways and speak a combination of languages amongst gibberish, it doesn't take much to realize that this film will undoubtedly inspire a few smiles and chuckles. However, sporadic smiles and chuckles do not usually amount to very good films, and because the Minions were once secondary characters that did just that, and are rather limited characters in a narrative sense, it's difficult for them to break out and be much more.<br/><br/>Because the Minions can't speak in a manner that we, humans, can decipher, the story must be kept simple and linear, something that DreamWorks does to a fault here. This is a film, I feel, is destined to only satisfy little kids, who are overjoyed that this film doesn't bear the kind of emotional and narrative weight Pixar's ""Inside Out"" did. The simplicity of the story, again, allows for a handful of cute moments, and some remarkably limber comedic setups, but once you realize how light, airy, and forgettable the film's characters and aura is, it's then ""Minions"" begins to fade from your mind before the end credits even begin to roll."
"MUFCOK","3","3","10","21 August 2015"," Strictly for Kids.
","Minions is without a doubt a money spinner which didn't consider the depth and options that would be available when making a full length feature movie with such a limited script. <br/><br/>The Minions were my favourite aspect of Despicable Me, they were funny and fresh, bringing fantastic support to the lead character Gru. This is where they are best, being offered in small portions, supporting other characters. Introducing them to the big screen, alone, without a leader was always going to be difficult to pull off and personally I feel like they failed. They benefited so much as supporting characters that putting them centre stage simply didn't work.<br/><br/>The greatest characteristic of animated movies is how they appeal to all audiences equally. Minions is very much a kid orientated film. It has little appeal to adults and it simply doesn't try to target that market. It is extremely more childish than the Despicable Me films which is to be expected I suppose but I will still disappointed nevertheless.<br/><br/>All the funny bits are in the trailers, which was massively disappointing. Gone are the days when you can watch a trailer to give you a sneak peak of a movie, still leaving you with some surprises when you view the movie. 3-4 minute trailers are ruining the film experience and I tend to stay clear of viewing them.<br/><br/>Overall Minions lacked any real depth and having 90% of the movie script-less hurt it badly. The story follows the minions on their search to find a leader but ironically, not having a leader is what made this movie fall short.<br/><br/>A generous 3/10."
"samgiannn","3","4","16","11 July 2015"," Too Much of A Good Thing Isn't A Good Thing in ""Minions""
","If you've ever seen Despicable Me or its sequel, you will definitely remember the little yellow tic-tacs called the Minions. They stole the show in almost every scene they were in, and they were memorable and cute little sidekicks. However, too much of a good thing isn't necessarily a good thing, and the origin story for the Minions is the perfect example of that. Minions shows what those little bananas did before they met Gru as they journey to the International Supervillain Convention in 1968 and become henchmen to the world's most notorious villain, Scarlet Overkill. The issues with Minions are present from the very first scene and continue throughout the entire film. Much of the humor, as agonizing as this sounds, is supposed to come from the way the Minions talk. That wears out its welcome extremely quickly as you can imagine. Even the jokes that don't concern the Minions are reused numerous times throughout the film, making this movie tedious and repetitive. That could be somewhat forgiven if Minions had interesting characters or a compelling enough story, but unfortunately, this film has none of that. The Minions aren't exactly dramatic characters; they're always the sidekicks, destined to be overshadowed by the villains they serve. Even Scarlet Overkill is a fairly generic villain. She doesn't have any sort of special powers or a unique personality to distinguish herself from other power-hungry female villains. There's never any sort of drama or development with her character. Now onto the unfocused and rushed plot. If you have the attention span of a goldfish, you might find the plot of Minions to be fun, but anyone else will feel like they're being suffocated by the insanity of this film. This movie just never takes a break. There's never a moment where you can calm your senses from the insanity of the previous scene, and it's not because it's some action-packed spectacle. It seemed like the filmmakers were trying to fit as much as they possibly could into each scene so that much younger kids wouldn't be bored. Minions might entertain the least demanding moviegoers and their very young children, but anyone else should stay away from the contrived plot, tired jokes and dull characters littered throughout this movie."

","Minions is the prequel to the Despicable Me franchise featuring everyones favourite Minions. I have to say i didn't really like this movie, i was quite bored for a lot of the movie as this movie didn't have much in it for anyone over 10 years old. There were a few funny moments here and there, but very few, and even then they weren't laugh out loud moments. Now, i am definitely not the target audience for a film like this but it would have benefited greatly from having a little more humour that a wider audience could enjoy, just look at pixar films aka Inside Out. The plot also wasn't anything great, it was your standard villain vs the heroes scenario but being a kids movie you can't knock it down for doing what it intended. The minions of course were the stars of the film (hence the title) and whatever good moments there were to enjoy came from them. If you loved the minions in the previous films you will love them in this as you get much of the same type of humour.<br/><br/>There isn't that much i can say about this film, i guess it accomplished what it set out to do for its intended audience, but unfortunately didn't offer any more than that. The performances and the characters weren't the problem, both the new and old characters i thought were well written and acted. Just the humour didn't really work for me most of the time, so i'm going to rate it a little low but if you really love the minions or are taking young kids to see it you and/or they will definitely get more out of it. - 4/10"

","I'm kind of surprised that this was as good as at was. Considering the Minions don't speak English, I thought it wouldn't really work as a full length movie if most of it was in Minion-ese. However, it does work and somehow you can understand what they're saying perfectly. This is an absolutely hilarious film. I'd say it's one of the best of the year! It's even got references to the original ""Despicable Me"" movie. Most of the humor is visual, rather than from the writing. It was great seeing everything tie in from this prequel to the original movie. It helps explain some things. Although it took away my theory that Gru created the Minions, their real origin is no more ridiculous than mine. It's fun for the whole family, and I look forward to ""Despicable Me 3.""

","Minions - good grief. An hour and a half that I will never get back.<br/><br/>Back in 2015 my son went with his cub/scout group, for a special treat, to see this movie. When he got back I asked him how it was; as a family we all liked the Despicable Me films, and this was part of the deal. Surprisingly he was a little reticent - he loves going to the cinema - and non committal. I now know why.<br/><br/>This is an utter abortion of a film. They could have made 18 five minute cartoons, or maybe two good ones, rather than invest the time this move took to drag out in a full length feature.<br/><br/>There was a plot; not a good one, admittedly, and - weak and lame as it was - it looked like someone had taken just two minutes to outline it on one side of a damp sheet of toilet paper. In crayon.
There were characters; again, not good ones (mostly forgettable, in fact) and the director appeared to have tried to make up for the lousy plot by telling most of the voice talent to ham it up like their lives depended on it. There was also quite a bit on national stereotyping, always the sign of a lazy scriptwriter, or a director looking for an easy life.
Even the animation appeared to be of a lower calibre than the usual Despicable Me quality (!); maybe because this was a movie set in the past, possibly to give the trainees and apprentices some on the job experience, but I suspect it was more just to save money.
The soundtrack was the best thing about this film, but then all you can credit Illumination with is choosing it; yet the target audience is 15 and under - who amongst them is going to listen to or even care about a bunch of songs from nearly 50 years ago?<br/><br/>I like the Minions, as characters. It is a concept that has a history in slapstick, and they can be as violent as can be gotten away with in cartoon form because they are quite obviously not human and appear to be indestructible. They work well as criminal, erm, minions in the Despicable Me films and they do make for amusing five minute fillers on the DVDs; this was one or two five minute cartoons stretched full length and packed with filler to pad out the slack. And there was lots of slack.<br/><br/>I doubt if we'll see a Minions 2 anytime soon. I certainly hope not, anyway.
But then, at the time, we would have thought the same about Sing..."
"leonblackwood","8","1","2","3 December 2015"," Totally Hilarious! 8/10
","Review: I couldn't stop laughing through the whole of this film and the fact that the little Minions didn't even speak English, proves that expressions and gestures are good enough to tell a story. Right from the history of the Minions, at the beginning, to the bonus material on the DVD, brought a smile to my face and the way that they joined the movie with Despicable Me, was a touch of genius. Even the Bradley Wiggins looking villain, Herb Overkill, made me laugh and all of the characters funny face expressions were spot on. Anyway, the lovely little Minions keep on, mistakingly, killing there masters through many generations, so they try and live without one for a while but they soon get bored of there own company. Kevin then comes up with the smart idea to go and look for the perfect villain, so the Minions have the perfect master, but none of the Minions want to go with him except for Stuart, who is quite a little rebel and Bob who is there lovable little brother. They then hitchhike there way to America and they find out about the Villain-Con from a bank robbing family who offered them a lift. When they get to the Villain-Con in Orlando, they sight the perfect villain, Scarlet Overkill (Sandra Bullock), who can save Minionkind from total boredom and after winning a competition between many other villains, the Minions are recruited by Scarlet to get the Royal crown from the Queen of England. After bonding with there new master, they head to London and the Minions attempt to steal the crown with the help of Scarlets husband, Herb Overkill (Jon Hamm), and his handy gadgets. Whilst on the run from the Royal guards with the crown in hand, Bob pulls out a sword from a stone to tackle the guards, not realising that the person who takes the sword out of the stone, immediately becomes King so he gladly rules England along with his two friends while the rest of the Minions are struggling to survive in Antarctica. Anyway, Scarlet soon realises that the Minions are ruling England, so she convinces Bob to change the rules and appoint her to be the Queen. As she is still upset about the betrayal of the Minions for not getting the crown, she banishes them to the basement while she is taking over England. On the day of her crowning, the Minions escape from the basement and they disrupt the ceremony by causing havoc in the palace. She then gets all of the villains whose attending the crowning, to kill the Minions but Kevin shows true leadership by using his brain to outsmart the villains. I know that a lot of people preferred Inside Out to this movie but I personally think that this was much better. I was thoroughly entertained right from the get go but it does get a little crazy towards the end. There are clever little touches, like the little rat and massive dinosaur, which are very well written and each little Minion bring something different to the film. There contagious laughs always brought a smile to my face so the movie really gets the thumbs up from me. Brilliant!<br/><br/>Round-Up: Because of the ending, it's doubtful that they will bring out another Minions movie, which is a shame because it's in a class of its own. The person who provided the voices for the Minions, Pierre Coffin, also directed the movie with Kyle Balda, who also co-directed the Lorax. Pierre Coffin also brought you the Despicable Me franchise, which I also enjoyed, so he must be over the moon with the success of all 3 movies. I also liked the Minions short films that came on the DVD and the Christmas sing-a-long which has the actors names who provided the voices. Anyway, you don't have to be a rocket scientist to work out that I really enjoyed this film and I can't see anyone, not finding the little Devil's hilarious. For this year, Jurassic World has taken in the most money at the box office with a whopping $1.6Billion, with Furious 7 and Avengers: Age of Ultron coming a close 2nd & 3rd and this movie is clearly in 4th place, which I personally think is well deserved. Although Inside Out is a better film in a lot of people's opinion, it comes in at 5th place in this years chart, right behind this movie. Anyway, the only reason why I didn't give this film full marks is because it does go a bit wild near the end but apart from that, I highly recommend it for all ages.<br/><br/>Budget: $74million Worldwide Gross: $1.15billion<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into their animation/family/comedies starring Sandra Bullock, Michael Keaton, Steve Carell, Jon Hamm, Steve Coogan, Geoffrey Rush and Allison Janney. 8/10"

","Hello, it's been a long time since this film had been released. I don't have an opportunity to watch it on time so I went to the cinema which always has the old films. This film is about the evolution of the minions. Through decades, the minions find their own villain boss to fulfill their needs. Especially, Bob, Dave and Kevin are cute, adorable. The best thing of the film is the minions are so absolutely cute, funny and crazy. The scene is so hilarious. The worst is that in the trailer, they have so may scenes which appear in the movie. It's not dramatic and interesting when you watch the movie. More is that when i went to the cinema, there are some people just laugh out loud and pretend as though they were minions. So childish! So what are my favorite parts? When Bob, Dave and Kevin wore bikini and went swimming. It's so hilarious! I'm just about to laugh out loud. I recommend this film to all ages."

","This film although not so bad, but is quite bad. For crying out loud, this film is based on 2 films which are good, they change the whole story like that and it is not worth it. I was actually excited about watching this film, but it is not as good as the others. I find that 3-7 year old can enjoy the film due to its cartoon like story and enjoyable characters, that is why I call it ""childish"". This films will make you laugh a few times, but you will find it annoying, not funny and even boring. I also do not care about the minions, or Sandra Bullocks performance ( Even thought it is her first time playing a villain) this film is childish."

","Just the idea of making a movie with characters that are not actually talking (mostly one word and as has been said using all languages to make it harder for people to actually understand anything) seems terrible. But the minions have proved in two previous movies, that they can steal the show (amongst other things).<br/><br/>Of course you can understand what they mean to say. Even if it's not even the actual word spoken (if you catch it and have knowledge of that said word of course). So yes you can criticize the movie for quite a few things, but what's the point? The minions are here to entertain and entertain they do - or as they would say: Banana!"

","This movie is based on the original story of how the minions from despicable me, came across their evil master,Gru.It shows how they started off as single-celled yellow organisms and as the minions evolve, they witness the different ages in time from the dinosaurs to the coronation of queen Elizabeth. As the years went passed, they started to think something was missing and wanted an evil boss to work for.The three main minions are Kevin, Stuart and Bob who have very different personalities. Kevin is the main hero who thought of having a boss and making everyone happy again as they were depressed. Stuart is the more laid back minion who like electric guitars and loves to eat.And finally Bob is like the baby minion who is obsessed with his teddy and just wanted to join in and help.I would rate it as 8 out of 10 because it was a very entertaining and fun movie.Even though it was a funny movie, it could've been more unique and had more to the story.However, overall it's a great movie and because it is suitable for kids, they will enjoy it very much."

","I am a huge fan of the ""Despicable Me"" movies. They are very good examples of films that could make kids crack up but also have enough heart to get adults interested in the story too. ""Minions"" does not follow in the footsteps of it's predecessor. The animation is obviously well done and the minions make a very likable protagonist. But two hours of that silly minion language is just too much. It can be funny from the start, but by the time the movie ends, they just start to irritate you. The supporting characters such as Scarlett and Herb Overkill aren't as interesting or compelling as Gru and Lucy. ""Minions"" doesn't give enough reasoning on why you should care about the story. All this movie is is just silliness, conflict, more silliness and then it ends. Verdict: The kids will be occupied with fun cheesy minion weirdness but will leave adults bored out of there minds. I recommend you just stay at home and watch the original ""Despicable Me"" movies."

","After the tremendous success of Despicable Me and a sort of cult following for the minions (those things are everywhere!) we get a spin off movie that belongs entirely to the evil little yellow creatures.<br/><br/>I'm gonna be completely honest, I'd be lying if I said this movie didn't crack me up in more than a few occasions. Yes, the jokes are childish and dumb, but some of them were really funny. The only problem is all of this happened within the first 30 minutes of the movie. The truth is the movie does wear down a little bit after the first act, but the main reason I didn't enjoy most of Minions was I got sick of the Minions themselves. I think the problem with this movie is they stretched the joke way too much. The Minions were hilarious in Despicable Me, yes, but it worked so well because they only appear for a relatively small portion of that film. In this movie, we see what is basically the same gibberish-fueled jokes for nearly 90 minutes and it grows old.<br/><br/>I have to give this movie credit for making me legitimately laugh in quite a few scenes in the beginning and for the great job they did in placing the story in the late 1960's, the music was great and it was an OK depiction of that time. But the movie does grow old fast, the plot doesn't make much sense, so I can't really say Minions was a satisfying movie experience for me, personally."

","Minions seemed to miss the mark in my book. The overall level of laughter in the theater was not as much as I would think for a movie of this Caliber. Making a movie like this where the main characters do not speak any known language has to be tough, but surely they could have done more with it. I'm a big fan of the Despicable movies, but this one was off.<br/><br/>The only humor came from various Minions falling over or running into things, which obviously got old after 15 minutes. Sandra Bullock's character was surprisingly annoying and was the main human voice in the film. The producers set the movie in the 60's, however the 60's pseudo-hippie soundtrack was completely out of place here. Pharell added magic to the first two movies and should have done the soundtrack here as well, the 7 year olds in the audience would have appreciated that more than the 60's rock. The British jokes were so tired...it's 2015. The first time I heard someone make a joke about British people drinking tea was in the 70's. Is all creativity lost?<br/><br/>On the flip side the Minions themselves are very charming and lovable, and made the movie. The ending was nice as well. You're going to have to see it anyway, so go ahead and go, just don't expect to much. At least they left out the ""required in kids movies"" out of place ebonics speaking random character.

Well, I should know better from the start, the very start, when I realized that Minions are not produced by Dream Works, but by Universal. Why is that? Well Universal have that tendency to ""overkill"" the story, for real. They literally overkill a story about Minions. This ""movie"" reminded me of a child play. When boy play with his G. I. Joe's or something like that, the story goes with too much blah, it's maybe fun to you when you are the one who is playing, but it is not too much fun to watch someone to do it. It's like some Japanese cartoons on steroid, and that is a murder of something that should be cool, like Minion's. It was just too much of everything, and that everything become a stupid, non funny movie, maybe just fun for director's, who done a lame work, and I don't know, maybe for the writers of this horrible story.

"slayer-521-130690","3","2","8","31 August 2015"," Does not have the snarky attitude and the good humor of the first installment.
","Whereas Despicable Me was a movie remarkable for its unique sense of humor and unconventional story, starring an evil genius along with his army of delightfully stupid sidekicks, the sequel *and* the prequel are sadly dumbed down to yet another film that can be described merely as ""cute"" and I guess ""funny"".<br/><br/>The first movie set high expectations and the minions were a raging success. Regrettably, most people enjoyed mostly their cute looks and silly antics, and less so the sarcastic point of view that elevated them from adorable, silly sidekicks, the kind that's present in every other movie, to hilarious creatures of pure bliss and stupidity that get anything done out of pure dumb luck. The second movie softened most of the sharp edges, toning down the underlying sarcasm and mischief, and finally the prequel, ""Minions"", barely feels anything like the first except that it includes minions and ""evil"" people. I put that in quotes, because even the ""evilness"" gets dumbed down during the series, from hilarious acts of random and sincere malevolence -like popping a passing kid's balloons or letting your dog take a dump in the neighbors yard- in the first one, to cliché stuff like stealing the queen's crown in the last - that one had me gasping ""oh no"" right from the trailer. Because the theft of the symbol of the British monarchy is the one thing that will keep people from ages 5 to 95 sitting on the edge of their seat.<br/><br/>The use of a narrator should immediately alert the viewer that this is a movie whose selling point is ""adorable yellow creatures doing silly stuff for an hour and a half"". Sure, there's a plot to keep things moving as well, but it's blatantly obvious that the Target Audience is mainly people that can spend 30 or more minutes watching videos captioned ""lolcats"".<br/><br/>This is a warning to the prospective viewer, who might expect something similar to Despicable Me: this here is definitely NOT an unconventional movie about hilariously dumb creatures in search for an evil master to do questionable deeds with. It is a movie about funny little thingies acting all cute and getting involved with evil masterminds (I wonder why they even kept that part, I mean these new minions are so softened up that any association with evil seems out of place. Some could argue that this is before they met Gru, so he hasn't trained them to be really nasty yet, but they're the same way in the second movie with Gru too.) Most of the funny scenes are already shown in the trailers, and almost all of them consist of minions saying silly incomprehensible things or making funny sounds to inanimate objects.<br/><br/>To my disappointment, the series has taken a direct turn towards the cute silly minions featured in memes about eating too much, sleeping too much and being single. If you liked the first for its fresh sense of humor, do not watch. If you liked it for the funny thingies that do funny stuff and are adorable, watch em all-- the last two come complete with ""awwwww"" moments to hug your cat under the blankets while eating chicken nuggets. Okay movie as a standalone, but another sad continuation of the Despicable Me series."

The killings of the masters in the beginning and the attempted torture scenes of the minions are too much. <br/><br/>They also took a lot of racist cracks at the British (teeth & tea drinking) and French. They were desperate attempts at trying to infuse humor. The audience would laugh, because they were desperately looking to laugh.

Who doesn't know these lovable banana craving midget freaks who speak in a gibberish language which seems to be composed of Spanish, French, Indian and English? since Despicable Me 1 came out the popularity of these creatures has been steadily growing. For Minions Universal pulled out all stops: the combined advertisement value of all promotions done by Universal's partners for this movie is about 600 million $. The faces of these critters could be seen on 500 million chiquita bananas, boxes of cereal, whatever you could think of they were on it. So unless you've been hiding under a rock for the last year you've probably heard of 'the minions'. Now with all this anticipation the film has large shoes to fill. Though I seriously enjoyed this movie I have to say that it can't match the heavyweights in the animation genre created by Pixar. Those movies work better on an emotional and storytelling level. Minions as you would expect has a story but it is nothing more than a vehicle for these yellow monkeys to do silly stuff and to goof off. And that they do very well. The minions have become icons -like Mickey Mouse- who will long be remembered after this movie has been forgotten because they will live on through the merchandise produced by the 850 manufacturers with whom Universal made licensing deals.

","'MINIONS': Two Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>A prequel/spin-off to the popular 'DESPICABLE ME' animated film series. It tells the origin story of the super-villain Gru's little minion helpers. The film was directed by Pierre Coffin (who also co- directed the two 'DESPICABLE ME' movies) and Kyle Balda; Coffin also voices all of the minions, in the film. It was written by Chris Meledandri and Janet Healy and costars the voice talents of Sandra Bullock, Jon Hamm, Michael Keaton, Allison Janney, Steve Coogan and Geoffrey Rush. The film is pretty silly, and rarely funny, but it's probably an OK kids' film.<br/><br/>The story starts at the beginning of time, when the minions were first born; as single-celled yellow organisms. They evolved into little naive creatures, with just one passion; to serve the most despicable master they could find. After killing every villain they've ever met, they go into hiding in Antarctica. But after years of depression, three minions (Kevin, Stuart and Bob; all voiced by Coffin) decide to venture out into the world, to find a new master. They meet Scarlet Overkill (Bullock), in Orlando, and find a purpose to live again. <br/><br/>The movie is probably the kind of stupid cartoon I would have liked as a kid, but it's painful to watch as an adult. Most of the jokes are really stupid and there's no really likable characters to root for (just the minions).

This is simply because they can't write (or milk, really) a complete movie out of a few minor characters that are only ever funny in small portions. <br/><br/>Unless if for some reason you HAVE to see this movie because you're THAT big of a fan, or you're less than 7 years old, don't see this movie."

","""Minions"" is the third full feature film from the ""Despicable Me"" franchise, but this one has the little funny yellow creatures in the center instead of Gru. Let me start with the positive aspects. They made a good decision to focus on 3 minions and not on the entire gang. The music was nice, some well-known songs. And all in all, the Minions were not really the reason why this film did not turn out well in my opinion. Their scenes were mostly okay, sometimes even pretty funny. With that I am referring to the first roughly 40 minutes, everything before London. The way in which the trio was recruited was well done. The scene where one Minion is so starved that he thinks the other two are bananas is good too. The scenes in which the Minions serve several famous evil guys in history are funny too. Obviously they did not dare to pick Hitler as this is a film mostly for kids, but the likes of Napoleon were interesting inclusions too. And I also liked the first appearance of Scarlett Overkill when she recruits the Minions. However, when the action turns to London, it all gets worse fairly quickly. The whole crown-stealing Queen-related plot did nothing for me and Scarlett Overkill was a pretty forgettable villain as well, just like her husband who wasn't even a real villain.<br/><br/>You have to ask yourself the question: Do more minion madness and Mrs. Overkill make up for the lack of Gru (except a very brief cameo early in the film and a slightly longer one towards the end), the three girls and other central characters. I have to say the first is still my favorite film. The way the girls were introduced was nice and it was not actually a film about beating the bad guy in the end, but about Gru making a connection with the trio. Lots of heart in there and a nice story. The second film was good too. I quite liked El Macho as a villain, but I did not like Lucy that much. Still, all in all it was a decent watch with many funny parts. A lot of these are missing from this movie here. Occasionally, I had to smile, especially in the first half hour, but near the end, it just gets really chaotic and uninteresting in my opinion. Also I did not like the way they finished the film with Gru getting in charge of the Minions. It was obvious they would close the film with such a reference, but it felt really rushed. ""Minions"" runs for roughly 90 minutes, which is pretty much the same runtime like the previous two films. However, in my opinion, they should have made this prequel to ""Despicable Me"" a 25-minute short film instead. As a full feature film, this did not work out so well. I cannot say a lot about the voice actors here as I watched a German dub in my local theater, but the way this film was heavily advertised with Scarlett Overkill I really expected a better and more memorable villain.<br/><br/>There is a 3rd ""Despicable Me"" film planned for 2017 and I hope they can step it up again. Then again, if they bring back Gru and the girls, it is almost by definition already better than this film here I believe. I am not surprised they aren't getting the same audience numbers as for the second film and probably not the same awards attention either. They need to really be careful now that this franchise will not become a sell-out. It would really be a pity as I believe there is still potential for 2 or 3 pretty good sequels. Let's see if they can deliver with the next one again. As for ""Minions"", it's the worst entry so far and I cannot recommend it."
"estreet-eva","4","1","4","27 July 2015"," Please come back Steve Carell
","Like Pixar putting Mater the tow truck in a lead role, this movie also confuses garnishing for the main course. Although the Despicable Me series never made it into Pixar quality territory, the films do entertain largely due to the comic timing and likely input on the script of multi-talented Steve Carell. Leaving these secondary characters in charge results in a tiresome, dragging light entertainment that will stretch the attention span of the younger set (you'll see much texting in the theater during this film). Beyond a lackluster script the basic limitation of the minions is there inability to communicate with the audience. They speak a non- subtitled variant of gibberish. While this was annoying in the Despicable series, having long stretches of it in this film makes for some baffling passages. With affable, approachable Sandra Bullock ineffective as an villain eventually John Hamm's sidekick character becomes the point of focus and, put simply, his English accent is worse than Mike Myer's Austin Powers. Speaking of that series of films, ""Minions"" is set in 1968 London (mostly). How many of the film's core demographic will get late 1960's English references is a question the marketing department was surely asking when told they would have to sell this clunker (explain the ""Abbey Road"" cover gag to an eleven year old). To these complaints add one more - the first 20-25 minutes are pure exposition. Towards the end of that period you wonder whether you could just go read the book instead if the all the director plans to do is to explain the tale to you. In short, the Despicable series ""Cars 2""."

","You have to give kudos to Illumination Entertainment for having found the cheapest way to make a billion dollars: Minions. They will just sell tickets no matter what with their mix of humor and adorable. Unfortunately, the ""cheapest"" part of that statement is true for the quality of the movie too and not only for the idea value.<br/><br/>Look, I get it, a Minions movie right away from inception does not have the potential for higher concepts or sophisticated storytelling, so I wasn't excepting the next Pixar movie or a ""How to Train Your Dragon"" level masterpiece. You might argue the opposite, but out of one thousand movies that you could make called ""Minions"" there is maybe one that could fulfill the task, yet it certainly wouldn't make a billion dollars worldwide. So I was excited to have some good fun and come out with a delighted smile on my face. Reality is, I came out with a frown.<br/><br/>I will say it up front that there is nothing to get angry about here. This is a more than fine movie to bring children too and I am sure they will have their fun, though they will certainly not come out and talk about it for days as they would have with a ""Toy Story"". What is bothering is how lazy the filmaking is and how boring the choices are. It is such a package for children only I can't see anyone of the directors, writers, editors etc. putting into this anything more than the lowest standard acceptable. This is really passionless. They always choose to dumb things down and never go for something more sophisticated that could have elevated the joy and the energy. The most bothering example of this is the choice to have narration at the start of the film. Other than being bland it just doesn't add anything and doesn't leave space for what could have been a first dialogue-less 10 minutes of delightful visual storytelling and gags which are replaced by Minions doing exactly what a narrator is telling us, uh what a bore. Not to mention the story overall which culminates in a dull and generic ending that I have probably seen countless times already in animated movies, I was really phased out by then.<br/><br/>I will say that there are redeeming qualities: throughout the film we are served a few smart gags that do deliver some more interesting humor. The minions work overall and don't get boring or annoying, on the contrary they always kept a smile on my face and worked best when they were used for some more intelligent humor, when they were just acting like childish babies they continuously made me check out, they simply don't work like that. It is so much more interesting to have them thrown into unlikely situations and see how they react to it, those were the fun moments for me.<br/><br/>As I said this is perfect for a child, but if you were excepting to have some adult fun with smart gags and sophisticated humor you will be partially disappointed."
"room102","4","1","6","14 September 2015"," For kids only
","OK, so I understand I'm not exactly the target audience for this movie. And I never liked the minions, even as sidekicks in the original ""Despicable Me"" movies - from the moment I saw them I considered them a failed attempt in making cute sidekicks. Everything that was great about Scrat (the squirrel) from ""Ice Age"" was done badly with the minions. I hoped to see them less and less, but unfortunately they decided to make an entire spin-off dedicated to them.<br/><br/>The movie has kids humor and some of the worst narration I've ever experienced: Not only is it poorly written and delivered (can't tell whether this is Geoffrey Rush's fault or the director's) but the thing is that it's completely needless. There is simply no need to narrate the obvious. Again, I understand the target audience is kids, but even THEY don't need such a narration for such a simple story."
"Diogo_Costa","4","1","6","24 July 2015"," Uninspired, unimaginative, annoying, but still somewhat fun.
","Minions, the prequel to the 2010's hit, Despicable Me, attempts to tell the minimal story of how the loved yellow creatures came to meet the criminal mastermind, Gru. Without a doubt, the little banana lovers have an undeniable charm, and from a marketing point of view, Minions has everything to become a major hit, as it seems it was built to please the huge amount of fans all over the world and to support the unlimited capacity for merchandising of the franchise, and as such, Minions succeeds. As a movie, not so much.<br/><br/>The filmmaking is left in second place. There isn't an actual narrative, character development, conflict or consequence. Everything is shallow, emotionally blank and devoid of any meaning. The film just exists.<br/><br/>On the bright side, there are still quite a few laughs in the film, even though, the humor gets old soon, as the creatures early begin to lose their appeal and start to become more annoying than anything else. There is a reason why the minions work as a support piece in Despicable Me and it is because they are built to be just that. It's not surprising that the film looks like a collection of short clips stitched together, as the storytelling power of the creatures is more limited that it looks. Still, it is somehow shocking how unimaginative everything is. Almost every scene is built around an overused sequence with minions in it - it's often hard to tell if the movie is built around references and tributes or if it is the result of a baffling lack of imagination.<br/><br/>But overall, it is still, somehow, fun to watch and there are still some things to appreciate in the film. The inadequacy of political correctness of the franchise and the sometimes dark sense of humor of the little creatures, are more than welcome in a family movie and certainly appreciated by older audiences.<br/><br/>In the end, and despite everything, viewers who unconditionally love the characters or viewers with young children will surely enjoy the film - very young audiences will probably love it, but it's questionable if anyone else will."

","I so wanted this to work...<br/><br/>The trailer got me all excited and I realize most of the funny bits are in those 2 to 3 minutes.There is some story and background to the minions but you get the feeling you all saw it before in better animated movies.Especially the first 20 minutes felt like a ""penguins"" rip off with the narrating and documentary style of filming.<br/><br/>This movie lacks the fun of both of the despicable films. Scarlett Overkill is a fading shadow compared to Gru and her relation to the minions is just not that interesting.And when I say minions I only mean 3 because the rest is being depressed on Antartica.<br/><br/>For now the franchise is severely damaged and it makes me wonder if they're ever gonna make a despicable 3.

","I'll never forget the first time I watched this film. I woke up early, pulled off my minions blanket, ran to the bathroom, pulled aside the minions shower curtain and began my shower, thinking all about the movie that would change me forever. Fast forward a few hours to the midday showing of minions, as my stepdad drove me to the movie theater, I honestly had moderate-severe anxiety. It's like the feeling you get right before graduating middle school, so many feelings of excitement. I have to admit though, I've never felt more confident with my appearance as I stepped foot into my local 2 star theater decked out in my minions overalls, as well as my minions gloves & boots. I walked up to the front counter ""minions for one please"" i said as I handed the attendant my weekly allowance. ""Would you like any snacks or popcorn?"" Asked the attendednt. ""Oh no thanks, I'm fine"" I replied. But little did they know, inside my overall pouch lay hidden away, 3 minions twinkies, and of course 1 ripe BA-NA-NA, so I could maximize my viewing experience. I walked to theater number 4 & found a sweet front row seat, directly in front of the screen. Eventually the trailers came to an end and the lights began to dim. ""Here we go"" I said as I pulled my minions goggles over my eyes. The next hour and a half was pure ecstasy."

","This movie may seem harmless in its content, but where it's toxic is where it decides to use its story and direction to make clear that it doesn't care about kids' potential intellect for subtlety. Minions doesn't give anything the audience doesn't realize it wants: it just plays it safe with fart-jokes and gibberish (the yellow-people's gimmick to start off with) and pop-cultural references because it is an empty shell with nothing to show for itself. It suffers from Shrek the Third-itis, where the movie doesn't care that it exists as long as it makes money and exploits the families paying to see this crap. The story, if there is any really, is just focusing on sentient yellow tic-tacs and their 'struggle' to find a villain they can follow blindly: fitting metaphor for impressionable kids who haven't watched PIXAR movies yet (REAL CGI animation done right, with actual story)! This is a product, not a movie. It may look nice, but save the Abbey Road reference there is nothing really valuable about the movie."

","Who didn't love the minions in Despicable Me? This film does great justice to the little ones by making them look cuter and naughtier than ever.<br/><br/>Bob, STuart and Kevin are the perfectly adorable trio, and their adventures (rather misadventures) are what makes the movie a roller coaster ride. They are followers, not eager to be leaders in the least. And in their quest for an admirable leader, they win the contest set by Scarlett Overkill, a woman who has hidden intentions. Scarlett is horrendous yet lovable and that's what makes this film a perfect treat for children. Every character is fun in itself. There's also plenty of running, chasing, climbing and jumping to keep the audience thoroughly entertained. The best part though is the entry of little Gru at the end and the minions mad following of their best leader ever.<br/><br/>This movie kept me engage throughout and has left sweet memories after it's end. Couldn't ask for more."

","Whilst these gooey lemons weren't the focus of Despicable Me, they were without a doubt the stars. As great as Gru was, not a single kid or adult left cinemas without at some point going ""Bannana!"" So it makes sense that they should end up getting a movie all of their own, that still has the same great animation and visual gags that made the franchise enjoyable to begin with. <br/><br/>It starts out giving a brief back-story for the history of the minions. Turns out the minions have been around since the dawn of time, always following the most evil bosses they can find. But their masters don't seem to last long as the minions end up accidentally causing the downfall of everyone of them, from Genghis Khan to Dracula. After hiding out for several years (leaving them oddly absent from having to work for the likes of Hitler or Stalin), 3 of the pint sized ducklings (Kevin, Stuart and Bob) go off to America in search of a new master in the 60's. Thus they go on an adventure, finding a new master called Scarlett Overkill, stealing a crown and accidentally taking over England. <br/><br/>The plot never actually takes any form, never remaining focused for long with the small yellow blobs getting distracted by every passing thing. But with the slapstick and chaos of the minions you don't really need one. It's less of a story and more of a series of sketches for the minions to put them into different situations going from hanging out with a family of bank robbers to being stepped on by the Beatles in Abbey Road. <br/><br/>An unexpected joy of this film ends up being the soundtrack. Not just because of the great Minion renditions (it starts off on a particular high note with the minions singing the 20th Century Fox theme), but also just a great selection of classic 60's tracks that should fill parents with nostalgia and introduce kids to some classic tracks. <br/><br/>However the film does have one key problem, which is there's too much from the minions. Their slapstick is funny, but it's not enough to carry the film for an hour and a half on it's own and ends up feeling worn out towards the end. The Despicable Me films mixed in Gru's brand of humour where he played the victim, that stopped the minions slapstick from becoming repetitive. It's also lacking the same emotional core that a character like Gru brought to Despicable Me, with his bittersweet story of a man becoming a father being far more engaging than a crazed villain wanting to own a crown. <br/><br/>But whilst the minions work much better as side characters, this spin off never feels like a misfire. It still has enough humour to be fun for the family, but just lacks the same level of rewatchability as previous films of the franchise."

And here it is.<br/><br/>Honestly, I know lots of people have been harsh on this film but if you take it for what it is it's a lot of fun and there are some funny moments.<br/><br/>The minions are as quite as ever and what's nice is that we start to see more about their individual personalities. The problem with prequels is that it is difficult to create conflict because as an audience we know that the minions are going to be fine and end up working for Gru. However the creative powers behind this film have made it so that this film both stands alone and also fits within the Despicable Me canon.<br/><br/>The only thing I would say is that the plot felt a little drawn out at the end. The bad guy (or bad girl) simply wouldn't be beaten! We could have done with 10 minutes less chase scenes perhaps."
