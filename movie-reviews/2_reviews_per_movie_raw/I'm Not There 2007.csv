"Chris Knipp","8","238","272","3 October 2007"," A film biography that's complex, like its subject
","Haynes' adventurous biopic of Bob Dylan, which uses six actors of both sexes and several races ranging in ages from 11 to 50, is both exhausting and fun to watch. It's also hard to describe. But let's start with those six and the characters or facets they portray. Arthur (Ben Whishaw) is the Dylan who incarnated Rimbaud and serves as a kind of narrator whom we see smoking and giving ironic answers to some kind of inquisition sporadically throughout the film. Woody (the wonderful young Marcus Carl Franklin, an amazing a singer and actor) is a precocious rail-hopper with a guitar (labeled like the real Woody's, THIS MACHINE KILLS FASCISTS) and tall tales that start with his claim that he's Woody Guthrie. Woody's scenes show him rescued by a black family and a white family and performing with country black musicals. He represents the early shape-shifting Dylan in search of an identity and telling a lot of lies along the way.<br/><br/>Jack (Christian Bale) is the Dylan who became a hit in Greenwich Village and went into the South and sang ""The Ballad of Hattie Carroll"" and other protest ""folk songs,""the high-profile ""political"" Dylan who spearheaded a movement and became famous with his brilliant early LP's. But Jack doesn't want to be typecast and ""betrays"" his adoring public and his lover and folksinging champion Alice (Julianne Moore), a Joan Baez stand-in seen in later ""interviews."" Jack disappears and his place is taken by Robbie (Heath Ledger), a young actor in New York who becomes famous for starring in a 1965 film depicting the vanished Jack. Robbie meets Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg) in a Village coffee shop and falls in love, and a turbulent ten-year marriage follows, winding up painfully at the time of the Vietnam War's end.<br/><br/>If Jack represents the cast-off early style and Robbie represents Dylan's family life, Jude (Cate Blanchett) is Dylan the artist, quintessentially as seen in the mid-to-late Sixties when he toured England (an event notably chronicled by two Leacock-Pennebaker documentaries)and shocked his audiences, some of whose members felt betrayed and shouted ""Judas!"", when he shifted from solo guitar and harmonica to more personal songs with loud rock accompaniment. Jude's segments are partly borrowed from Pennebaker, but largely consist of gorgeous black and white scenes deliberately and ""churlishly"" (Haynes' word) imitative of Fellini's 8 ½.<br/><br/>Jude's new style is admired by Allen Ginsberg (David Cross) and underground groupie Coco Rivington (Michelle Williams) and he becomes internationally famous. But he continues to be misunderstood by the protest music old guard and conventional journalists like the British TV host Mr. Jones (Bruce Greenwood)who's incorporated into a music video for Highway 61 Revisited's ""Ballad of a Thin Man"": "". . .something is happening here /And you don't know what it is, do you, Mister Jones."" . .<br/><br/>Jude and Arthur articulate the early Dylan's challenging, ironic stance to the public, but Jude is exhausted on tour and his nihilism leads him to an existential crisis.<br/><br/>He's reborn symbolically in Pastor John (Christian Bale again), who's moved to Stockton twenty years later and become a born-again preacher, singing his own gospel songs. Finally the last version of Dylan appears in Billy (Richard Gere), in full retreat from the worldtill threats to destroy his town of Riddle cause him to enter public life again. This sequence evokes a Sixties historical western in which Pat Garrett (Bruce Greenwood) is a character.<br/><br/>This is only the barest outline of the two-and-a-quarter-hour film, in which various ""Dylan's"" are woven in and out. Maybe the reason why I found Woody's sequences delightful and Billy's colorful but wearying has to do with the latter's coming two hours later. But Gere and his sequences evoke Dylan less well and are puzzling to interpret. Blanchett's in contrast are, of course, the most conventionally straightforward. She's the only one who successfully mimics the physical appearance and the speaking voice of the artist (unless Whishaw does a better job with the voice). But Blanchett's mimicry is intentionally undercut (and the biopic conventionality of films like Ray avoided) by having Jude be played by a womanwhich was planned by Haynes in his screenplay before he even chose his actor.<br/><br/>The method Haynes has chosen avoids cliché. This is still a biopic, but it's a sophisticated one; and the fractured portrait is well justified by the nature of its subject. Dylan has always been a shape-shifter; some of his permutations were left out, such as the period of the orthodox Jew and JDL supporter. But it's intelligent to see Dylan the man, the husband, the artist, the political being, and the religious being as completely separate entities because no simple biopic sequence can really dramatize the complexity of such an artist and such a protean existence. Haynes' film makes you think about biography itself, as well as giving imaginative shape to aspects of Bob Dylan no non-fiction account can really provide.<br/><br/>Maybe it's the daringly experimental methodology that led Dylan himself, approached through his eldest son Jesse,to grant Haynes both the musical rights and the biographical rights. Haynes has chosen a multifaceted and original way of using Dylan's songs. Only Franklin actually performs them with his own voice. Otherwise the soundtrack mixes original Dylan recordings with existing covers, new ones by people as widely various as Ritche Havens, Iggy Pop, John Doe and Sonic Youth, and other music, including, appropriately for the 8 ½- esquire sequences, Nino Rota. There is a voice-over narration by Kris Kristofferson. Haynes worked on the screenplay for years, and then collaborated with Oren Moverman.<br/><br/>Not for mainstream audiences or be prime Oscar bait, but a challenging, fun watch. <br/><br/>Shown in the press screenings of the New York Film Festival at Lincoln Center 2007. Haynes was present fort a Q&A afterward with J. Hoberman of the Village Voice, which revealed that the director is an intelligent and articulate man and who knows his Dylan."
"billcr12","5","10","10","25 April 2012"," Disjointed mess
","First and foremost, Bob Dylan is a genius and a perfect subject for interpretation. A great idea with mixed results in I'm Not There. Cate Blanchett opens as Jude Quinn, a mid 1960s era Dylan getting on stage but quickly shown in a motorcycle accident. The British actress looks uncannily like the folk singer, especially in silhouette. <br/><br/>Marcus Carl Franklin portrays Woody Guthrie and the eleven year old boy proves to be a major talent. He travels the country by train and in a time shift travels to a hospital to perform a song for the real Woody Guthrie. <br/><br/>Christian Bale is in a documentary style portion as fans praise the great artist as the voice of a generation as he treats and reporters with contempt. Bobby does not come off to well as a human being.<br/><br/>Later on, Bale reappears as a born again pastor, which showcases Dylan's brief Christian period , preaching to a congregation and singing the gospel tune ""Pressing On"" from the album ""Saved.""<br/><br/>Heath Ledger is in a film within the film as an actor playing the Christian Bale character in the least interesting part of I'm Not There. <br/><br/>The second unnecessary segment is Richard Gere as Billy the Kid looking for his dog and meeting Pat Garrett and a convoluted storyline with a funeral, a jail break and back to the train once again. I found the whole experience a disjointed mess with some fine acting. I love Dylan's work, so this is a wasted effort."

","'I'm Not There' Todd Haynes, 2007<br/><br/>The biopicture can be a difficult kind of picture to picture. Even more so when you have no intention of divulging the name of your subject. And dare I say it, yet further still when you insist on casting at least six people to play the lead role. This is the charm behind 'I'm Not There' - Todd Haynes' tribute to the life and times of Bob Dylan that recently lit up the Festival di Venezia. Biographic cinema is a frightening beast, some films are stuffed full of information while others attempt to exactly mimic their respective studies. There are however very few that play with their quarry, flitting from fact to fiction so quickly that in the end we know not what to believe. In reality, the life of Robert Dylan was exactly this mess of lies, grandeur, childishness, arrogance and genius. One of almost unbelievable occurrences that when whispered about long enough become carefully set in stone. Todd Haynes understands this fact and so goes after it with a stance of almost awed respect, yet as an onlooker - crafting a mockumentary that is so rich in character and love and attention to detail that we can't help but be drawn in. I've heard early reviews stating that 'I'm Not There' will make the Dylanites gush and the normal folk sleep. The fact is this couldn't be further from the truth - being a person that is indifferent to the music appears only to heighten the enjoyment.<br/><br/>Somewhere during the last five years, writer/director Haynes came upon the slightly trampled idea of conducting a Bob Dylan biography movie. Nothing original in itself, though with one idea to make it slightly different from what the likes of Scorsese had attempted a few years back. He would use multiple actors for 'I'm Not There', six in fact - to portray the iconic figure. And what an inspired decision it is. The unrecognisable and slender form of Cate Blanchett steals the show, melting into her eye-rubbing, nose-twitching, lip-conscious take that is only too quick to lash those in proximity with a witful tongue. Almost as idiosyncratic is Ben Whishaw's sarcasm-laced drawling poet Dylan. Who prompts guffaws when tiresomely declaring his name as ""R-I-M-B-A-U-D"" to an arresting police officer. The eccentric duo are displayed primarily in overexposed black and white, and complementing this in Technicolor are the equally impressive Christian Bale and Heath Ledger. Whom fall upon the unwashed, shaded rocker Dylan with equally strong performances. To complete the musical sextuplets are Richard Gere and the delightful Marcus Carl Franklin, these two are the tall-tale Dylans. A jaded western cowboy and a blues-singing black child respectively, both adding another more fictional dimension to the character. They are almost opposite ends of the Dylan-spectrum, and are introduced at the opening and closing of the film to further embolden this point. Franklin in particular impresses, tugging at the humor strings again with his dry recollections of a life on the musical road.<br/><br/>The host of supporting actors/actresses in 'I'm Not There' do well to further the films themes. With Charlotte Gainsbourg and Julianne Moore taking up the posts of drama and documentary accordingly. Each plays one of the two most important women in Dylan's life, with Gainsbourg (Sara Lownds) cooking up a memorable on-screen chemistry - or lack thereof - with Ledger's character. She is instantly attractive across a smoky diner, yet this attraction soon wanes as romance stagnates. Never-ending tours take their toll and the once exciteful, scooter-riding relationship crumbles. Moore's character (Joan Baez) is more reflective, playing her whole part as if interviewed enthusiastically many years on. My only problem is with the later segments of 'I'm Not There'. Particularly those featuring the bearded and bespectacled Richard Gere. Many know the story of Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid, and this part is essential when regarding the plot. My qualm is that it feels almost tacked on as an afterthought, trotting outside the clear themed borders that the film has laid out so meticulously. This only adds to the ballooning length of the film, and so did begin to drag during these Wild-western plot points. That said, this hardly takes away from an experience that is both visceral and enlightening. Comedic and pensive. Wild and tender. A life, in all possible senses of the word.<br/><br/>9/10"
"mickjongold","9","121","163","18 November 2007"," Amazing! (Dylan's not there)
","This film amazed me. One reason it worked for me is because it's drenched in Dylan's music. I wasn't expecting that. Most of the time, it's Dylan's voice when 'Blind Willie McTell' or 'Moonshiner' or 'Idiot Wind' (the slow, acoustic version) suddenly erupt on the sound track to huge emotional effect. Other times instrumental teasers from 'Man In The Long Black Coat' or 'Nashville Skyline Rag' are planted in the mix like fragments of dreams you can't quite focus on. All the pre-release publicity had revolved around Cate Blanchett is girl Dylan! and Marcus Carl Franklin is African American boy Dylan! but the film itself unfolds like a kaleidoscopic dream where the pieces never quite meet. A bit like me and all my friends scratching our heads in the 1960s and 1970s and earnestly wondering how John Wesley Harding related to Blonde On Blonde, or how Slow Train Coming related to Blood On the Tracks. Well they don't. In ""Chronicles, Volume One"" Dylan dwells on the moment when he stumbled across Rimbaud's declaration ""Je est un autre"" which translates into English: ""I is someone else"". Dylan writes: ""When I read those words the bells went off. It made perfect sense. I wish someone would have mentioned it to me earlier."" That insight has sustained Dylan thru all his multiple personalities, finger pointing folkie, rock & roll rebel, Nashville good ol' boy (Oh me oh my, love that country pie), tormented lover, Born Again Christian. When he performed on his first album, aged 21, he was trying to summon up the voice of a 60 year old blues singer. <br/><br/>That insight sustains this movie because Haynes and his team have been able to match a visual style to each image of Dylan's life. From the burnt out black & white textures of 'Fellini's 8½' which seem to lock Blanchett inside an amphetamine-fuelled bubble of superstardom to the mellow colour photography of 'McCabe and Mrs Miller' which frames Richard Gere. I was surprised by the long Gere sequence. He seems like a recluse in the backwoods but all these strange characters and circus animals roll past, capturing the mood of those bizarre Basement Tape songs: 'Please Mrs. Henry', 'Open The Door Homer'. It seems to be set in a realm that Greil Marcus called 'The Old, Weird America'. And there's a visionary flash where Gere peers into the landscape and has a glimpse of Vietnam. It made perfect sense to me. There's a moment in the Sing Out! interview with Dylan in 1968 (when Dylan was secluded in Woodstock) when Happy Traum asked Dylan ""Why don't you speak out against the Vietnam War?"" and Dylan replied: ""That really doesn't exist. It's not for or against the war. I'm speaking of a certain painter and he's all for the war. He's ready to go over there himself. And I can comprehend him. People just have their own views. Anyway, how do you know that I'm not, as you say, for the war?"" When Charlotte Gainsbourg (who seems to be playing a composite of Suze Rotolo and Sara Dylan) suddenly drops the divorce settlement into Heath Ledger's lap, the film cuts to newsreel shots of Henry Kissinger and Lo Duc Tho signing the Vietnam ceasefire accords in Paris. This film isn't a biopic, this film works in a free association surreal way, like Stuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again, or Highlands works. It's true to the spirit of one of Dylan's greatest songs, a song which goes places where no words can go, a song which gives this film its title: ""Now, when I keep believing I was born to love her /But she knows that the kingdom waits so high above her /And I run but I race, but it's not too fast or slow /But I don't deceive her. I'm not there, I'm gone..."

","I just saw I'm Not There at the Telluride Film Festival. It is AMAZING. The performances are nothing short of spectacular. Cate Blanchett really nails the role except that her voice obviously can't hit the same bass as the real Bob Dylan. She does, however, look creepily like Dylan in many instances and really gets the mannerisms right. Christian Bale is another standout. It should be mentioned that all of the performances are really top-notch, nobody falls short. The music was fantastic, too (obviously). My one complaint would be that the film goes on a bit longer than it probably needs to but not enough to affect my overall score. I floated out of the theater after seeing this one. It is definitely essential for all Dylan fans. Many of the people I saw the film with were not very familiar with Dylan's life or music but they said they enjoyed it as well. See it the day it comes out!"
"randyhndrsn","8","77","115","3 January 2008"," This movie is good but in a weird way.
","I recently watched I'm not there and this movie isn't done in a way that really makes sense sometimes or flows, but after the first 10 minutes you really understand what is happening.This movie has differen't stories from differen't characters that come in and differen't times, and they all have something to do with bob Dylan's life.I thought the movie was gonna show one story at a time, but they show one for like 5 minutes then another one and comeback to it later and sometimes only show a clip for it for a few seconds.This is done in a very art-house style and is for fans of the genre, it isn't abstract crap like some movies but actually has some great scenes that are visually wonderful.Some scenes play like Fellini's 81/2 and this movie feels like a foreign film a lot of the time but the characters speak English.This movie is far from perfect for my taste and I am not a huge Dylan fan but I respect him a lot, the movie pretty much does a good job at pulling you into it and you go for a ride.It's well made and the acting is good all around, don't watch the movie if you don't like art type films or movies that focus on characters and out of place scenes that are put there for a visual purpose.It's a cool flick and I think a lot of people can respect it, it's nice to see something original and not in some movie formula like a lot of Hollywood blockbusters we get these days."
"Movie-Jay","8","96","150","19 September 2007"," Saviors Grow Fast Asleep
","Saw this at the Toronto Film Festival. I really liked it, although maybe the Richard Gere scenes are the one's to skip, though it's not really his fault. Cate Blanchett is getting a lot of buzz for her performance, and she deserves it. The actors are all playing versions of Dylan, though their characters have different names. Blanchett plays an incarnation of Dylan that would be right around the time of ""Don't Look Back"".<br/><br/>Although I think Todd Haynes is mostly successful here, I fear that this will be a film that will really interest people who already know about Bob Dylan, and that it will sort of fly over the heads of everyone else. A good movie, and a nice place to start if you're a young movie lover who wants to expand and see something less conventional."
"barryjaylevine","1","26","36","17 August 2008"," He took too much LSD...not Dylan, the director.
","Cate Blanchett is wonderful. The parts of the film in which she acts are compelling. However, all of this could have been done (and has already been done) via documentary footage.<br/><br/>Okay, so you can't pigeonhole Bob Dylan. (Oops; was that a spoiler?) Do I care that he had groupies? Should I? The rest of this miserable excuse for a time-waster is filled with disparate visions of a director let loose with too much money and not enough discipline nor studio oversight. It's always a danger when the director is the writer and this film proves that warning. The last movie that was this bad was Heaven's Gate; and it bankrupted two studios.<br/><br/>This is a genuinely awful film barely rescued from the dung-heap by Cate Blanchett. Thankfully, we won't have to remember this film when we remember her distinguished career.<br/><br/>Rarely have I screamed at a film ""Get to the point!"" but, in this example of a director playing with himself, you find that there is no point. ""I'm Not There"" leaves you thinking that ""I Don't Care"" and so becomes ""There's Nothing Here"".<br/><br/>Pardon me while I now wash thoroughly."

But none of the characters are named ""Bob Dylan"". And Joan Baez has a different name.<br/><br/>What's the point?

It could have been an MTV video.<br/><br/>It's a good cast - for the most part - and there's nothing wrong with the acting. And it's super-inventive to use Blanchet.

","If you are thinking about seeing this movie I would suggest that you research Dylan first; otherwise you will be lost from the get-go, like I was.<br/><br/>You need to know that the characters all represent different aspects of Dylan, and that even though they are ""Dylan"" they have different names. Some of the Dylan aspects are personified as a young black boy using the name Woody Guthrie, a woman, and a middle-aged Billy the Kidd, for example. And the film jumps from character to character and then back again, frequently.<br/><br/>Chances are, if you are not an art film aficionado, you won't care for this one. On the other hand, if you do your Dylan homework, you may very well enjoy it even though it isn't typical mainstream movie fare."

","Before I saw this movie, I didn't know very much about Bob Dylan. By watching this I was hoping to gain some insight into his life and his beloved songwriting. After viewing the movie I walked away more confused than I did coming in. For an artist that wrote and performed songs relating to the working class American, it seems strange that a pretentious art-house angle would be used to portray his life. He came across as a cold, bitter individual. The meandering and unfocused direction of the movie seemed to have been made by an amateur college student with no sense of breathing life into it's subject. It's a shame that the talent of Christian Bale, Heath Ledger, Richard Gere and others were wasted. Perhaps I will gain a strong appreciation of Dylan, but I didn't from watching this."

If anyone is unfamiliar with Dylan and sees only this, they will run for cover, missing the genuine treat of his achievements.<br/><br/>Julianne Moore mimicking Joan Baez' interview from No Direction Home was an insult to Baez (and Scorsese). Christian Bale's talentless renditions of Dylan works was an insult to Dylan and me. And, sorry, I can't tolerate a dykelike Cate Blanchett (who I love) mugging her way about as Dylan.

No point of orientation, no direction home. So okay, maybe the movie caught what it is like to be Bob Dylan, not knowing who you are or where you belong. Five points for that. But in one point- and I'm positively sure about that- Todd Haynes wasn't right- being Bob Dylan must be a lot more exciting than this movie.

"danielahantuchova","10","45","72","9 November 2007"," The finest American film of the 21st century
","Todd Haynes' I'm Not There is a genuinely visionary work of art; ostensibly a biopic of Bob Dylan, Haynes has actually made seven different short movies, each with its own precise cinematic language, which have then been carefully interwoven to create a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts. <br/><br/>I won't bother rehashing the film's central conceit and plot, which have been extensively commented on elsewhere. I will say that the misguided reviewers who praise the Cate Blanchett portion of the movie above the others (wonderful though her performance is) are missing Haynes' point entirely. Each of the different segments of I'm Not There inform and comment on each other in ways that are sometimes direct and sometimes oblique but there is ALWAYS a logic to the overall structure. <br/><br/>For someone to say that they would have preferred a movie entirely about Blanchett as Dylan is tantamount to saying that they would have preferred a more traditional Dylan biopic in the manner of Ray or Walk the Line. This traditional biopic formula is precisely what Haynes is trying to explode and the Richard Gere segment of the film (the most critically maligned portion of the movie by far) is where he succeeds in his strategy the most!<br/><br/>Despite what many critics have written, it is not Christian Bale as the born-again Dylan who portrays the oldest incarnation of the Dylan character. It's Richard Gere as Billy the Kid. What Haynes seems to be saying is that Billy the Kid should have been gunned down in his youth by Patt Garrett but has miraculously lived to grow old - just as Dylan should have died in a motorcycle accident in 1966 yet is still on tour today at age 66. (Viewed in this light, each of the younger versions of Dylan can be seen as the memories of Gere's Dylan-as-aging- outlaw.) While it is true that Gere's segment also has ties to the ""Basement Tapes""-era Dylan, the fact that Billy is also supposed to represent Dylan in the 21st century is crucial. Without this understanding, the interaction between Billy the Kid and Woody Guthrie (the completion of a circle of life) makes no sense. No wonder critics are flummoxed at the Gere portion of the movie! <br/><br/>This is the kind of film that makes you grateful to be living in the present, when a genuinely daring and extremely talented filmmaker like Haynes can use the resources of Hollywood and bend them to his will to create something that is at once experimental, radical, challenging, funny, moving and, yes, finally, liberating. I'm Not There leaves the rest of contemporary American cinema in the dust."

Perhaps even Bob himself dreaming about the course of his life. The more you do know about what's out there about Bob the more you'll be able to make the connections with the scenes in this beautiful montage about the poet, songwriter, and musician genius of the last 60 plus years. This is a great film about a very complicated artist who could never be pinned down as representing any one ideology or persona although he seemed to imply many. I suppose Dylan will always be the great enigma and this film only helps to perpetuate it, which is part of what makes it so successful but as we all now know there's no success like failure and failure's no success at all."

","Cate Blanchett continues to amaze. She does not act. She becomes another person. It is like some sort of magical trick. It will be a travesty if she does not win the Oscar. Ruby Dee - please. Was she in American Gangster? Did she have more than 3 lines? This movie is bad beyond bad. A meaningless collection of images and gibberish. I loved the Billy The Kid segment. Wow! Surely some sort of hallucinogen was required to create this movie. Are they telling us that Bob Dylan is really a random thought generator? Toss in a quarter and get a stream of words. Maybe it is accurate, I do not know. If it is I would never have made the movie and exposed an audience to such nonsense. I recently read that Susie Roloto, his ex-girlfriend says in her biography about her time with him that ""He had an uncanny ability to complicate the obvious and sanctify the banal - just like a poet"". What an apt description this would be of I'm Not There."

","What a huge disappointment. This was probably the worst movie I watched in 2008. I am a big Dylan fan and had high expectations. But this movie wanted so much to be a film, to be artsy and smart and European, it really made me sick. <br/><br/>Things I disliked the most: 1. the 3 afro-Americans jamming out on the porch, it felt so fake it's sad, 2. the Rimbaud type character, 3.

Yes, she is a great actress, I agree, but in my opinion (and I read all the comments about how well she captured Dylans ""acerbic, yet vulnerable dimensions..."") she is way overrated in this movie.<br/><br/>Best things: 1. the music of course, 2. I thought the film citations were pretty well done.<br/><br/>My advise: 1. you want to watch a good mainstream music movie - go for The Doors; 2. you want art - go for the real thing; watch ""à bout de soufflé"" or ""la dolce vita"" but do not waste your time on hot air"
"jazzpiano-","7","13","18","6 January 2008"," I'm Not There
","I saw this yesterday at my local art-house cinema, with my grandparents who were young when Bob Dylan was 'big' (is my lack of knowledge about Dylan already showing? Oh dear), and I have to say, I'm glad I was there - even if Bob Dylan wasn't.<br/><br/>The much-publicised, overly re-hashed concept driving the film is this: Dylan is portrayed by six actors of different races, ages and genders, none of whom are named Dylan, but represent aspects of his personality and life story. Every art-house buff will squeal at this delightfully off-kilter concept (well, except that it's been done before) - but never used so cleverly I'll admit. But, the cleverness of the concept only remains clever if it is executed well. This is where most people have a problem with the film.<br/><br/>Most of what you may have read in reviews is correct. The film is challenging, borderline plot-less (unless you are generally acquainted with Dylan's life) and seems muddled (again, only if you don't have a general knowledge of his life). For anyone who can't grasp the basic, ""each actor represents a stage etc."" concept, this film will be lost on them completely... because it gets even more complicated! The film is so layered, with hidden in-jokes, and snippets of real quotes from songs and interviews with Dylan used as dialogue, and story lines within story lines. A great example is Heath Ledger's character: Ledger (an actor), plays an actor, playing Jack Rollins in a biopic, who is the representation of folk-singer-Dylan (a stage). An actor in a biopic playing an actor in a biopic about a singer representing Bob Dylan played by an actor in a biopic. The self-parody is just hilarious in this film.<br/><br/>To add to these 'layers', each actor's ""stage"" that they represent is filmed in a distinctive cinematic style, for example, the Cate Blanchett as Jude Quinn representing Bob Dylan sequence is shot in lush black and white. Haynes relishes this opportunity to show off, and he does. The film is stylistically stimulating, even if it does drag sometimes for ignoramuses like me who know literally nothing about Bob Dylan.<br/><br/>For those questioning the film's intentions as a biopic, I should think it was really obvious! The opening credits give a huge clue, as the main title comes up in stages: ""I"", ""He"", ""I'm he"", ""I'm her"", ""Not her"", ""Not here"", ""I'm not there"".<br/><br/>The film is like a dream: you come out of it with this vague (exact details in the film are scarce) and vivid impression of Dylan's personality, without learning anything. The title is certainly relevant - Haynes' actually conceals Dylan in this film! This biopic is conventional in the way it still presents a chronological life story if you arrange it all together and remember the actors represent one person, but it is different in the way it doesn't try to make a real person into a character for a film. This is really the only way to represent someone - by not.<br/><br/>This film is composed of stories and individual representations and metaphors that describe a person's life, their attitudes at points in time and aspects of their personality, but gives us nothing. Absolutely nothing.<br/><br/>So, if you're ready to put the level of effort and concentration required to appreciate and maybe like the film, go for it. But I was not prepared for this film and I wish I'd read a biography before I saw it. That said, not knowing anything did help in a way, as after we had several questions about events in the film and their basis in reality. After all, the trailer had told us that stories were exaggerated, fictionalised, imagined and true. It inspired me enough to look him up on Wikipedia (I know, such dedication!).<br/><br/>The performances are all generally good. Blanchett, Bale and Franklin impressed me the most. Blanchett only falls short because of her voice, but she has the accent correct, and she can't change her voice that much! She became more believable as the film progressed. Charlotte Gainsbourg is also quietly moving in her role as the neglected wife of Ledger's character.<br/><br/>My final opinion is that the film is well executed, but only once you've had time to ruminate on it, research Dylan and hear the director's thoughts on his own work. I read a great deal of reviews as well that helped me to understand (not that I didn't like the film initially; I liked it after I saw it anyway). Appreciation builds the more I learn about the film and the intricate connections between it and it's un-subject.<br/><br/>That said, should a film be this much hard work just to like? Not for some people, but for others, the effort is worth it. It does eventually pay off, but it's exhausting."

","To appreciate I’m Not There., you need to fully buy into its somewhat-implausible premise; in it, six actors represent various aspects of Bob Dylan throughout his many decades in the limelight. If you buy into this premise, then this is a unique, thoughtful perspective of an almost-unknowable individual, a man who famously played things close to the vest, a man who shunned introspection. But if you don’t immediately buy into this premise, then the movie just feels like a long experiment that isn’t entirely successful, and in the end you don’t feel you know much more about the man, the myth, the legend than you knew going in. Which might be the point, who’s to say? And that’s sort of where I land on the whole I’m Not There. issue.<br/><br/>Here’s one big problem right off the bat. The six various characters, each representing part of Dylan, have different names. Some of them are named after real-life people, like Woody Guthrie and Arthur Rimbaud. Some have fictitious names, like Jude Quinn (an amalgam of Jude from “Hey Jude” and Dylan’s own “The Mighty Quinn”), Jack Rollins, and Robbie Clark - the latter being an actor playing one of the aspects in a movie. And then it gets confusing.<br/><br/>The first gimmick for this movie is that each aspect is played by an actor you wouldn’t expect to see playing Dylan. Okay, maybe not all of them, but some of them. Cate Blanchett is one. She’s female, in case you were unsure, and she is by far the best Dylan in the movie. She plays Jude, the latter-day, peeved-at-everyone Dylan. Another is Marcus Carl Franklin, who plays “Woody Guthrie” - here, a young version of Dylan, riding the rails across the Midwest. Franklin is African American. Then there’s Heath Ledger and Christian Bale, who are Australian (as is Blanchett) and Welsh, respectively. The problem with those, though, is that the only difference between them and the real Dylan is Dylan’s particular linguistic tendencies, so you wind up with just some guys acting Dylanesque. You know, the perpetual cigarette dangling precariously, the hat, the whole nine yards.<br/><br/>It would have been more effective, for me, if each of the aspects was played by completely different looking people - because in order for them to be identifiable as Dylan, they would have to sound like him. Otherwise you’re left with some folk-singing iconoclast who’s rebelling against everyone, and you don’t know why. So there’s one issue. And that would have been a clever, but not too-clever, way for each supposed aspect or time period to be represented. Even if two aspects were on the screen simultaneously, big deal - at least we could tell who was who.<br/><br/>But added to this gimmick is the fact that some non-Dylan characters - and some situations - are based on real-life people, like Allen Ginsburg, and retain their counterparts’ names, and others are clearly supposed to be real people but have … different names. And some situations definitely did occur (such as Dylan’s getting booed at the Newport festival, a huge turning point for him), but did all of them? Were any of them made up to highlight that particular aspect of his personality? One of the characters is Arthur Rimbaud. No, not the poet, he just has that name. Anyway, the entirety of his screen time is spent giving testimony or something to officials (or a jury, I’m not sure). And his speeches are of the deep philosophical sort, the kind that Dylan was apparently fond of - ways to get into people’s minds, but I’m not sure what the soliloquies add in terms of exposition and revelation.<br/><br/>Then there’s also Richard Gere, who plays Billy the Kid, another “aspect” of Dylan. Apparently here Billy is mythologized as this hiding loner at the end of his career, just sort of like Dylan, only Dylan’s not even now at the end of his career, unless he keels over tomorrow, or something. Gere’s good, and I don’t say that often, but I think the aspect, such as it is, is too abstract and unreadable to be worthwhile.<br/><br/>The intermittent narrator (Kris Kristofferson) is marginally helpful; perhaps he could have been used to tie all these aspects together. Instead we get two hours of ego feeding and idol worship. To me, though, it felt more like idle worship than anything else, a waste of time even if you’re willing to grasp whatever deep insights the film pretends to offer to you."

","I just returned from viewing this film at the New York film festival, and I must say it potentially Haynes' best film to date. By abstracting from a conventional biopic, the film captures the essence of Dylan. The different actors that play Dylan chronicle the metamorphosis of an icon. With an astounding ensemble the performances are flawless. Cate Blanchett in particular, is uncanny as Dylan at the peak of his stardom, in all likelihood securing a Supporting Actress Oscar nomination. Technically the editing is seamless and Haynes is successfully able to integrate a multitude of styles. In emulating Dylan, the film itself is structured much like a poem. Haynes strings together fact and fiction, the real and surreal and the self and society into a magnificent fabric that illustrates the identity of one of the greatest American icons."

","Todd Haynes (""Velvet Goldmine"", ""Far from Heaven"") created a non-linear, truly original film, that must be seen by every Bob Dylan lover. Haynes's tapestry is ""inspired by the music and lives of Bob Dylan"" - he introduces us to 6 different Dylans: Jack Rollins (Christian Bale), Woody Guthrie (Marcus Carl Franklin), Jude Quinn (Cate Blanchett), Robbie Clark (Heath Ledger), Billy the Kid (Richard Gere) and Arthur Rimbaud (Ben Whishaw), interweaving their stories in a groundbreaking narrative slightly similar to Todd Solondz's unsettling, caustic ""Palindromes"" (2004), in which several very different actresses (and a boy) play a 13 year-old pregnant girl. <br/><br/>While ""Across the Universe"" illustrated The Beatles' fantastic songs with simple, adorable characters in a psychedelic rhythm, but with little character development (not that I'm complaining: I absolutely love to see visual masters like Baz Luhrmann or Julie Taymor on fire, since their self-indulgence creates wonderful sensorial pieces), ""I'm Not There"" is much more complex: it's deeper than conventional biopics (""Ray"", ""Walk the Line""), and much smarter than exploitative flicks (the atrocious ""Factory Girl""). Haynes crafted a unique film that's a feast for the eyes (thanks to cinematographer Ed Lachman, ""The Virgin Suicides"", who also co-directed the disgusting ""Ken Park"" with Larry Clark), ears (Dylan's music is always a pie in the sky) and mind (it'll make you admire the man even more, and it doesn't even need to be an ass-kissing biopic to succeed on that). <br/><br/>The cast is heterogeneous and solid, but I think critics are overrating Cate Blanchett for the sheer fact that she's playing a man (which makes things more challenging for her, indeed), when she's not really better than most of the cast; a good performance for sure, but I was much more impressed by Christian Bale and the young revelation Marcus Carl Franklin. Julianne Moore, Charlotte Gainsbourg and Michelle Williams play some important women from Dylan's life, and the always underrated Bruce Greenwood has a small but interesting part. All in all, this isn't a film that will enjoy big commercial success, and it's probably too artsy (although, not in a bad way) to get the Academy's top prize (even though Blanchett's performance and, maybe, Haynes's magnificent directing/writing, will probably be remembered), but it's a real gem for those who want to see something really exciting and original. As for myself, I'm thankful to Haynes and his audacious, faithful producer Christine Vachon (this woman rocks, and in a perfect world, she'd have all the money that a certain Jerry Bruckheimer possesses), who always dare to blow us away - something rare, these days. Fascinating. 10/10."

I cringe at the memory of Heath Ledger mumbling his lines (something he did in Brokeback as well) and Charlotte Gainsbourg sporting her new chin surgery.

It will likely not be so for you, at least to approach the way I did. It seems that you have to be my age, and have lived through the events the wrap this. Also, you have to have invested some part of your personal poetry in that of this man. And finally, you have to be sufficiently cineliterate to follow the amazing shape of the eye-concepts that are serially birthed.<br/><br/>Often I say that essentially all films are about other films, rarely reaching life. This does that, reaching life, but by going through, punching through art by force. It presents a collage of images in such a way that we can see through the space in them to truth. Its an amazing feat. But in order for it to work, you have to have those patches sparkle for you.<br/><br/>So for instance you have to have internalized Fellini's one masterpiece, and be yearning for decades to escape the now close confines of the imagination set then. Of course when it was new, it was a wild ramble in the jungle, but now turn to tethers in the park. You really have to chafe at what passes for cinematic art, and dream of the next film, the one that will do for us what ""8 1/2"" did then. <br/><br/>You also have to have lived through the blasphemy of the Vitenam war and ideally have been on the ""right side"" throughout and still bear the pain of it. You have to  seriously, even though the director is too young for this  have had your life ruined by the revelation of a lying government, coupled with the spinning parade of false hopes from artists, many of whom we still admire. You have to have built your life taking into account mistrust.<br/><br/>But you also have to have had this particular dancer as a focus. This man who split into so many men, most of whom were designed to charm, all of whom weren't men at all but crystallized paths to salvation. You have to have invested in a few of these paths yourself enough so that it cost you more than it ever could Dylan.<br/><br/>If you have all of these traits then you already have the web on which this tarantula dances. And this will seep into you like some exotic solvent carrying subtle hallucinogens. And it will haunt you forever. Oh, you'll be able to slough it off and pretend that this is merely a clever puzzle of kinematic trivia. But this will hurt. It will hurt a lot, but only because of memories now defused.<br/><br/>It will make you soar as well, because it is so massively glorious. Many Dylans, well of course. Different ages, races, sexes. My, surely true.<br/><br/>Stories about films of one in another, about hiding from each other, about having sex with and spatting with each other. About disowning, and writing about each other. About one being another's blood, who is the hidden eyebrow of another in a Joycean web, but one that makes sense because it is made out of the stuff that made us.<br/><br/>What impresses me so much is that even before this was conceived the filmmaker had to know something like this fabric of selves existed. And he had to  without having lived it himself  develop deep intuitions about how this specific soul danced upon us in music and images. He had to understand how to borrow and bend those images with the music in ways that would make Julie Taymor blush: ""Thin Man"" used not for confused sexual tension but the conflating of superficial dylanology with artistic expiration. ""Pat Garrett"" as the context for a world rather than the escape from one. Over and over again the juxtapositions of life events, image and music (often performed by others in strange deviations) are all wrong but so right.<br/><br/>And then this artist had to see it all cinematically, to send it directly into our soul. I suppose this is a particularly broad leap because of the disconnected way this must have been made. <br/><br/>I celebrate this. You might wonder if it worked for someone, somewhere. It sure did for me.<br/><br/>Cate understands the whole enterprise, from the outside, all the way through every layer.

Todd Haynes may be trying to imitate Dylan's consciousness, but only Dylan can have it all come out as genius. What we get, instead, is two hours of watching really good actors struggling with free form, aimless, pointless, really bad direction and writing that dribbles down the screen, to be blessedly forgotten by the next self-serving scene. If he needed to change Dylan's name as played by the various actors, and change historical references to other people around him at the time, why didn't he change Kennedy, Nixon, et al as well? Is Haynes trying to pay tribute by stealing (poorly) portions of Fellini, or does he think that no one has ever watched Fellini, and he's being 'new'? Watch ""Don't Look Back"", or ""No Direction Home"" if you want something even close to truth. Better yet, skip this piece of trash, and listen to Dylan himself. Even just looking at the old photos of Dylan will give you more information about him than sitting through this.

","Unless you know something about the subject of this biography, you're bound to be confused by ""I'm Not There"". It is ""inspired by the music & many lives of Bob Dylan."" For the unenlightened, Mr. Dylan was famous, long ago (""for playing electric violins on desolation row""). The film, by writer/director Todd Haynes is excellent, but inaccessible. And, strangely, if you know anything about the subject, you're going to learn approximately nothing knew. To help navigate, there were four main Dylans <br/><br/>FIRST and famed-mostly, Dylan was a ""Rock Star"". This period is played out by Cate Blanchett as ""Jude Quinn"". This character sports a fictitious name, but like much of the movie, comes (not from McCartney's ""Jude"" but) obviously from Dylan's oeuvre - the Christian ""Jude"" and ""Quinn the Eskimo"". This Dylan has the clearest Beginning and End points of any. He was ""born"" when startling his folk audience by ""going electric"" (guitar) and ""dies"" in a motorcycle accident at the peak of his fame.<br/><br/>SECOND most famous, and highly influential, Dylan was the ""Folk Singer"" replaced by the above. Here, it's Christian Bale as ""Jack Rollins"". This Dylan was quite popular on his own, but was much ""covered"" by other folk artists and rock bands. During this time, Dylan was more like a very big cult, and his songs were more widely heard when other people made hit records from them. The songs were more Political (protest) during this time, getting vague later (with exceptions, like ""Hurricane"").<br/><br/>THIRD time around for Dylan was his ""Cowboy"" persona, essayed herein by Richard Gere and named ""Billy the Kid"" after the outlaw anti-hero Dylan play-acted. This was the Dylan emerging after the motorcycle accident. Dylan left a bunch of unreleased tracks (known as ""The Basement Tapes"") and ""reinvented"" himself as a more countrified mellow rocker (listen to ""Lay Lady Lay""). Here, the ""stages"" of Dylan's art become more blurred as he no longer commanded the attention he did earlier.<br/><br/>FOURTH biggest change, after a long run without defining boundaries, was the ""Born Again"" or ""Christian"" Dylan. This startled some people, but (as the film points out) it shouldn't have been unexpected. In fact, the ""Fame""/""Drugs""/""Jesus"" continuum is very common among music stars, as anyone watching MTV's 1990s biographies could plainly see. For this film, Mr. Bale (uniquely) plays two Dylan incarnations, revising his earlier ""Folk Singer"" character ""Jack Rollins"" to become ""Pastor John"". <br/><br/>BUT, that's not all. There are three less public parts of the quadraphonic Dylan covered by Mr. Haynes <br/><br/>FIRST is Dylan's mysterious boyhood masquerade as ""Woody Guthrie"" played by Marcus Carl Franklin. He is the kid on the train, sporting the Fascist-Killing-Guitar-in-the-West. Of course, Woody Guthrie was a real person, and he had a tremendous influence on Dylan. While cute and well done, this section is not revelatory, which could be why the film project had ""the real"" Bob Dylan's blessing. The real Dylan, who appears briefly near the end, did not appreciate biographers peeking into his personal history.<br/><br/>SECOND is Dylan ""The Poet"" named ""Arthur Rimbaud"" and played by Ben Whishaw. Like the above, but more of a conglomerate, the character is a real French poet named Arthur Rimbaud who influenced Dylan (and many other rock stars). The Dylans are presented in sort of an overlapping chronological order - which may not make sense to the uninitiated - but this one is used more like a muse for the others, accentuating Dylan's reputation as a true ""Tarantula"" of a Poet, even without the music.<br/><br/>THIRD and perhaps most esoteric is Dylan ""The Actor"" played by Heath Ledger as ""Robbie Clark"". Dylan did do some movies. Mortals do not forgive. Even an epic focusing in his relationship with a certain sad-eyed of the lowlands. Rather than show Dylan acting in a movie, this ""Actor"" section perversely shows the more camera-shy Dylan. It seems highly fictitious, but you've got to appreciate ""Dylan"" telling what looks like ""Patti Smith"", ""chicks can never be poets."" (!) And, ""I Want You"" is a terrific vignette. <br/><br/>In sum, ""I'm Not There"" is an excellent film for obvious believers, with minus zero insight into its subject. Bobby Zimmerman could hardly disapprove. By the way, the fact that the vinyl ""Stuck Inside of Mobile with the"" was amusingly continued in the ""Blonde on Blonde"" gate-fold jacket as ""Memphis Blues Again"" is no excuse to edit the song. And, changing the lyric, ""Here is your 'throat' back, thanks for the loan..."" to ""Here is your 'mouth' back, thanks for the loan..."" really sucks. Moreover, it's sacrilege.<br/><br/>******* I'm Not There (9/3/07) Todd Haynes ~ Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett, Heath Ledger, Richard Gere"

","I am a fan of Bob Dylan's talent. I admire him as a singer-songwriter, musician who plays several instruments, and especially as a poet. I understand very well that Dylan is not Luciano Pavarotti, Robert Plant, Freddie Mercury or Ian Gillan but his rough, nasal and far from perfect singing voice speaks to me clearly. For five decades he's been a major figure in popular music and the number of his admirers has only increases as time goes by. It is not surprising that the figure of such complexity, influence and enigma would attract journalists, writers, and film directors who would try to understand and explain phenomenon of Bob Dylan. When I learned about Todd Haynes' films about Bob Dylan where different aspects of his personality during different times of his life, represented by the different performers, I became a little suspicious. The whole idea sounded a bit pretentious even if I respected what Hayens was trying to achieve. Sadly, his approach did not work for me.<br/><br/>The movie is all over the place and it jumps from past to present and around the world with the grace and elegance of a behemoth. 6 actors of different ages, genders and races play the different Bob Dylan's personalities. I have no problems with many actors playing one person but the problem is - Hayens in his latest film is not Federico Fellini or Luis Bunuel who had made a movie with two actresses playing one character. Bunuel's last film was funny, mysterious, and interesting because Bunuel did not make a big deal of it, and because of his incomparable sense of humor. Having six actors playing one character makes the movie crowded, claustrophobic, and over-complicated with no particular reason and with ""no direction home"". Besides, of six actors, not all are equally good and it is not perhaps even their fault. Try to create depth of the character, for instance, in Richard Gere's part as a Billy the Kid outlaw figure - I could not help laughing out loud every time Gere was on screen and I love the actor dearly. One of the ominous signs for me that the movie is bad is an urge to laugh in the wrong places. Or take another Dylan's incarnation by the name Arthur Rimbaud - you either know who Arthur Rimbaud was and you laugh at the parallel Haynes tries to draw here or you don't, and it would make no sense to you why the French poet-Rebel of 19th Century was brought to life to enlighten us with the pieces of wisdom like: ""I accept chaos. I don't know whether it accepts me ""or ""Y'know, it's nature's will. And I'm against nature. I'm not cool with nature"" among others. <br/><br/>I understand that ""I am not there"" was the loving tribute and the attempt to understand one of the most complex, enigmatic, controversial, and influential figure in the modern culture but quoting Dylan himself, <br/><br/>""You may call me Terry, you may call me Timmy, You may call me Bobby, you may call me Zimmy, You may call me R.J., you may call me Ray, You may call me anything but no matter what you say... "", Mr. Haynes, sorry, but it did not work as the whole. <br/><br/>You should have made the movie with one Bob Dylan - like figure and it should have been Cate Blanchett. She is way above all five male performers combined together, and her Jude Quinn simply blew away all other personalities from the screen. If ever the dis joined overwrought overcrowded incoherent self-indulgent and confusing with no redeeming cause movie did reach a high point, it was with Blanchett on screen. She keeps proving with her every role that she is truly one of the best (for me THE best actress of her generation - courageous, always ready to take on the challenge, convincing, compelling, beautiful talented Cate Blanchett.<br/><br/>4/10 - all points go to Cate Blanchett"

"EUyeshima","5","3","3","13 May 2008"," Flawed But Periodically Compelling Collage of Dylan Makes for a Murky Character Study
","I wish I was better prepared to accept the sheer audacity of Todd Haynes' wildly imagined take on Bob Dylan's life and legend because this 2007 film requires a certain mindset to accept a fragmented story thread that tethers together six disparate evocations of his persona. The conceit is that none of the personalities look remotely like him or have his name, which I believe is Haynes' main point, that Dylan is an enigmatic figure open to anyone's interpretation of who they think he is. Part of the frustration in watching the film is realizing that we don't know that much more about Dylan by the end. Most of the references to his checkered career in the screenplay co-written by Haynes and Oren Moverman will likely go past most viewers, even though many of the lines are direct quotes from Dylan. That's the most significant flaw of the approach taken here, that we are familiar enough with his life to make sense of the story being told.<br/><br/>At the outset, we see Dylan as a black eleven-year-old who hops boxcars, writes folk songs as if he was living during the Great Depression, and goes by the name Woody Guthrie after his hero. Luckily, the precocious Marcus Carl Franklin is terrifically winning in the part. The second incarnation is Jack Rollins, a young 1960's-era folk singer with a political conscience played compellingly by Christian Bale. Julianne Moore, the star of Haynes' 2002 Douglas Sirk tribute, ""Far from Heaven"", shows up in documentary-like footage being interviewed as a Joan Baez doppelganger. Bale also shows up later as Pastor John singing gospel songs reflecting Dylan's born-again conversion in 1979. With sometimes merciless bravado, Heath Ledger plays Robbie Clark, a Method-style Hollywood actor whose most acclaimed performance is of Rollins in a biopic. He gets married to a French girl, played affectingly by Charlotte Gainsborough, whom he eventually alienates with his obsessive, chauvinistic behavior.<br/><br/>The most talked-about Dylan persona is embodied by Cate Blanchett, physically transformed into Jude Quinn, the male singer who achieves the pinnacle of his success in the mid-1960's only to face harsh criticism for going electric with his music. Looking more like a morosely arrogant k.d. lang, the actress gives a convincingly unapologetic performance as the drug-addicted musician whose media sound-bites were becoming a cynical series of non-sequiturs meant to make fools of the press. In the film's weakest passages, a rather somnambulant Richard Gere plays the latter-day Dylan as Billy the Kid in a surreal, San Peckinpah-influenced world set in the tense western town of Riddle. British actor Ben Whishaw rounds out the Dylan parade in a few faux-interviews as Arthur Rimbaud, a young rebel named after the tortured poet. To emphasize the differences among the Dylan interpretations, Haynes uses different film stock and narrative styles to tell the stories and then further convolutes matters by scrambling the disjointed fragments into a nearly random collage. Dylan's music is used throughout, sometimes as background, other times by contemporary performers lip-synched by the actors. His voice is an almost ghostly presence until he finally shows up playing his harmonica in 1960's-era documentary footage at the end.<br/><br/>Part of me is genuinely impressed with Haynes' experimental-feeling narrative and how his film is imbued with an adventurous spirit that doesn't hold much concern for an audience's sensibilities. That's also the rub since it's difficult to have a feeling for an admittedly mysterious subject when the portrait is made up of six shards of a broken mirror. The two-disc 2008 DVD set provides plenty of extras starting with Haynes' rather elliptical commentary track. Also on Disc One are four text pieces under ""Intro to Film"", one describing the film's six principal characters as facets of Dylan. Disc Two contains six shorts featuring each of the characters replicating the famous card-dropping in Dylan's ""Subterranean Homesick Blues"" video. There are also two deleted scenes, four alternative/extended scenes, and an outtakes reel, the total of which runs about a half-hour. Audition tapes of Franklin and Whishaw and a tribute to Ledger are also included, as well as footage from the New York premiere and a twenty-minute featurette on the making of the soundtrack. The centerpiece of the second disc is ""A Conversation with Todd Haynes"", a portrait of the filmmaker running about 45 minutes that has Haynes talking about the genesis of the film and how it was made. More Dylan-specific text pieces and two theatrical trailers round out the extras."

","This was an audacious concept. Having Bob Dylan portrayed by half a dozen different actors assuming fictionalized personas. As if the real Bob Dylan wasn't full enough of terminal contradictions. But as the producers of this boring, pretentious mess could only paraphrase and not quote directly from any documented reality (what is reality?) except Dylan's songs, of course, the film looses itself in the meanders of absolute arbitrariness and sundry parallel universes in spite of the best efforts of some worthy actors and talents. I lived through the sixties and Dylan's rise to celebrity and I didn't recognize anything of my perceptions of him in this film, probably because either the film or Dylan himself (who knows, right?) is more preoccupied by the flotsam and jetsam of terminal hype, the fame game and/or celebrity rehab scenarios to actually care what a man's music is supposed to mean (if anything). If you ever saw anything worthy in Dylan's music, you'll think twice about his talent after seeing this film. If you always thought he was a fake and a flake, your opinion will not be seriously challenged by this delirious and wasteful Actors' Studio job-creating program."
"Polaris_DiB","7","5","6","6 February 2008"," Hey look, a biopic that actually fits its subject!
","This film honestly could not have come sooner. Now that the world has ""Dewey Cox"", the idea of the biopic as cliché (think about it, do artists lives ALWAYS follow that particular narrative arc?) has garnered its own momentum to literally standardize public figures lives into similar profiles. This movie evades and destroys this effect completely by throwing out veracity and accepting all of Bob Dylan's idiosyncratic messages, identities, stories, themes, and creative drives at face value, no matter how contradictory they may seem. The result is a movie that is possibly the ""truest"" version of an artist's life: one that just says everything he does to represent himself is right, and builds up a much more interesting character than a single identity.<br/><br/>Now, in terms of the various actors, they all do their due. Cate Blanchett and Christian Bale manage to project Dylan best by far, as they grab hold of his tics and his movements like dogs at raw meat and never let go. Todd Haynes also makes sure that the ""different"" story-lines are inter-cut and layered so that no stress is given to a single ""character"" and a much clearer understanding of Dylan's various identities as one identity is argued.<br/><br/>That said, because of this approach, Haynes has the regrettable and understandably difficult job of trying to figure out where to start and where to end. Inevitably, ""I'm Not There"" ended up running about a half an hour too long, something that could have been easily ignored except for how ultimately exhausting the movie is. HOWEVER, this movie is very experimental in the way that it uses cinematic devices to tie these seemingly contradictory approaches into a portrait that is at times spectacular, gorgeous, and compelling... and during a moment or two, manages to be all three! One particular point about Bob Dylan that should be noted and that this movie places emphasis on is his desire to evade classification. As shown quite graphically in ""I'm Not There"", Dylan has alienated many of his own fans with his refusal to set himself on a single course. As a result, this movie itself can alienate a lot of viewers with its refusal to settle down to one direct theme or concept. Sometimes ""meaningfulness"" comes almost into grasp, only to have the scene end and a completely different story continue where it last left off. The entire movie is ""in media res"" as concerns where he came from and where he's going. In that way, ""I'm Not There"" gratefully evades placing a sense of closure to an already idiosyncratic subject who is not yet dead.<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"

","Even when I had only heard of the idea of having 6 different actors in a movie playing different personalities of Bob Dylan, I thought it was stupid. Then I kind of got convinced otherwise by the names in the cast and the promising trailer. Having seen ""I'm Not There."" now, I know that my initial notion was right. This movie is nothing but pretentious, self-indulgent crap.<br/><br/>Bob Dylan's best music always works on two levels: you can enjoy it just for sounding great or you can really dig into it and figure out the true meaning of the author's poetry. ""I'm Not There"" doesn't work on that first level. It's not enjoyable at all, if you're not familiar with Dylan's biography (and I wonder if it was different if I were). All those great actors (and actresses) are wasted here. I actually found Cate Blanchett to be the most annoying. She embodied everything that people who don't really understand Dylan make him out to be: an incomprehensible nerd, that always blabbers seemingly senseless BS about himself or his art that people don't really understand but think of as the revelation of modern poetry. Ben Whishaw's part was similarly dispensable.<br/><br/>It was hard to tell what the deal with the other Dylan impersonators (Christian Bale, Heath Ledger, Marcus Carl Franklin) was. There was no apparent connection between them, and the individual story lines really weren't that interesting at all. The main offender was Richard Gere's part, though: an aging Billy the Kid who stumbles through the movie as if he thought he was on the set of ""Young Guns III"". Seriously, every time he came on, there was giggling in the audience, his character is that out of place.<br/><br/>Well, after a while I had to struggle to stay awake. I really expected much, much more from this, at least something, anything, but this movie was just one big nothing. The word ""pretentious"" has been invented for this mess. Dylan must be really disgruntled that it's once again The Beatles who got the entertaining movie (""Across The Universe""), while the one about him will only attract geeks who spend too much time listening to ""Time Out Of Mind""."

","Oh we must be truly sated indeed with the standard-issue biopicture, with its patented and trademarked rise to glory and fall into drugged ignominy with phoenix-like rebirth, to accept a sorry film like this as some kind of precious alternative. This is a film that promises to tell us something about Bob Dylan, but instead presents a semi-impressionistic series of unrelated images that are supposed to represent various facets of Dylan's personality and public image. What we end up with is probably the most indulgent rock film since Roger Waters' ""The Wall."" Along the way, a pair of fine performances by Heath Ledger and Cate Blanchett are used as grist for the mill. When Blanchett is on screen, we want to watch, but she doesn't tell us anything either because she's acting out the most enigmatic portion of Dylan's life. On the other end of the extreme there are these laughably nonsensical scenes with Richard Gere riding around on a horse surrounded by images taken from Dylan's more obtuse lyrics. And Christian Bale's performance here is a laugh-out-loud mistake. It's surely a very beefy and well-fed Dylan we're looking at there.<br/><br/>You've got a director who wants to be the equal of Antonioni, and he has indeed succeeded in making a very superficial movie about the superficial. So I'd give him credit there -- his film is just as pointless to look at today as most of the ""art"" films of the 60s and 70s are. Basically all the weight of all this artistry and technology is being put to task on Dylan, a man who in and of himself would be of little interest if it weren't for his music.<br/><br/>Some of the most interesting ideas in the movie come out of the least effective scenes. For example, the idea of portraying some version of Dylan as a little black child is a disarming symbol -- is it supposed to tell us about how Dylan once saw himself, as a new Woody Guthrie, or about how the public wanted to see him? As he sits on a porch and sings ""the blues"" with a pair of rather typical Hollywood country black folk, the music emerges with studio clarity. The words ring out, ""The sun's not yellow, it's chicken!"", and no words like these were ever heard on a back porch in the South. Is this a statement on how in our quest for authenticity, we accept the post-modern as the authentic tradition? Or is it simply trying to pass off the young Dylan as an authentic folk voice? Ultimately it doesn't matter because the scene itself is so cloying and annoyingly slick.<br/><br/>Basically, you have to care a whole lot about Bob Dylan as a person, you have to think he's some kind of mythical personality, to accept this movie. If you don't think Bob Dylan is all that important, then you're going to wish you had these few hours of your life back. They would be much better spent watching ""Don't Look Back"" or ""Hard Rain"", to see the real Dylan doing the things that actually made him famous and popular. The man was an entertainer, not a prophet. The film seem to want more than anything to make exactly this point -- and yet it drapes the man and itself as cinema in so much deliberate obscurity that clearly in the film's heart it wants to hold onto the mystique more than it wants to open up any truth for us."

","From the onset, 'I'm Not There' will leave you reeling with post-modern malaise. Countless referencing and pastiches of cinematic milestones such as '2001', '8 ½', 'Stardust Memories', 'If.', 'The Man Who Fell to Earth', 'Whity', 'Breathless', 'Week End' as well as the slate of Dylan documentaries ('Eat the Document', 'Don't Look Back', 'The Other Side of the Mirror', 'No Direction Home') and Dylan's own 'Renaldo and Clara' and 'Masked and Anonymous' films, anyone with the slightest knowledge of both Dylan and classic cinema will be suffering cultural vertigo.<br/><br/>It's hard to see who this film is appealing to. Dylan die-hards will be groaning at the pedantic references and those with only a casual interest in the great man will be scratching their heads to make anything of it at all. For such an obvious film, one is left with no more knowledge of Dylan than before. Even the most mundane bio-pics (which this seems to be consciously reacting against) can have knack of propelling interest in a subject, but newbies will probably not be enticed to investigate any further after enduring this mess.<br/><br/>Although a handsome looking production (showing none of the corner cutting that was only too obvious in the similarly misguided 'Velvet Goldmine') and well scored with plenty of great original Dylan recordings, even these assets seem to be a crutch. The songs come so thick and fast it's as if Haynes is using them as some sort of glue to hold our interest along with the pretty photography. And for all its purported experimentalism, the film remains highly derivative and obvious. The heavy handed use of Dylan lyrics as dialogue is deeply cringe-worthy, as are the sledgehammer visual clues (such as the tarantula  itself a reference to a shot in Ingmar Bergman's 'Persona' - walking across the screen during shots of Blanchett's Dylan writing).<br/><br/>Most embarrassing of all are the celebrity performances. Christian Bale is truly terrible, covering the folk-troubadour Dylan and (an in-joke perhaps?) the ""Christian"" Dylan like a bad comedian. Cate Blanchett is a pretty impressive mimic in general (witness her Kate Hepburn in 'The Aviator') but her performance falls hopelessly apart every time she opens her mouth, as her uncanny physical approximation is shattered by her all too self-conscious whine. <br/><br/>Most pointless of all are Ben Whishaw's 'Rimbaud' (groan), who serves no real purpose other than to get some sloganeering across, and the Heath Ledger/Charlotte Gainsbourg subplot which only serves to bog things down. This is exasperated by the fact that Ledger's character is actually that of an actor who played the role of Bale's fictional Dylan in a movie within the movie (if that makes any sense!) It's obviously modelled on the domesticated, Woodstock-era Dylan but just what it achieves by being at a further remove from its source is something lost entirely on this viewer.<br/><br/>To be sure, there's an interesting film essay to be made about Dylan (if any more really need be documented on the great man) but it ain't this, babe."

"DaveDiggler","7","17","30","25 May 2008"," A Chaotic Masterpiece Embodying Bob Dylan
","Todd Haynes has created a biopic so different than the norm that it's assuredly going to be bashed for not meeting the everyday standards of the everyday movies with the everyday formulaic narratives. Like Bob Dylan, Haynes never once backs away from what he tries to accomplish- change, chaos, and ambiguity. This film is Bob Dylan. The themes, settings, look, pacing, characters, chaos, ambiguity, contradictions, and for the fact that this never once tries to explain who Dylan is or why he is the way he was is so fitting it's hard to imagine a biopic on Dylan done any differently. This is a bold film done in a fresh and unique way. This isn't the usual ""Walk The Line"" or ""Ray"" type singer-biopic (Which are excellent films in their own right) where you have one great performance surrounded by the life and times, the highs and lows, and then the conquering of life's obstacles. When you watch those films, you know where we start and how we finish before the movie even starts. You just enjoy the journey. ""I'm Not There"" baffles, confuses, lies, contradicts, and makes you question everything. We never know where we're going, who we're going to meet, or what time and person we'll end up with. Haynes doesn't have one person recreate Dylan as Dylan was. He relies on six actors and actresses to play parts of the enigma that we know as Bob Dylan.<br/><br/>Haynes style is magnificent; the music is engrossing; the acting is on point from every actor in the film with award worthy performances scattered throughout; the cinematography was excellent; the writing superior to most of this decade and the editing was excellent. We never once feel we're at one place with one character for too long, or we jump into one life unexpectedly where it feels forced. Gere's part seems out of left field and it completely is, but when we're there we learn just as much about Dylan than we have with any character. Blanchett, Ledger, and Bale are the three standouts. Blanchett will get most of the praise because she embodies Dylan's psychedelic, far out trips, flamboyant behavior, and his eagerness to rebel, question, and change. Ledger gives one of his best performances during a marriage that is falling apart due to infidelity and long lasting time away as he plays Robbie Clark- a young, up and coming actor. Christian Bale plays Jack Rollins. When Rollins pops up it's through a documentary like form. We're watching a movie within a movie about one of the characters. Not only is that unique, but Robbie Clark (Heath Ledger) plays Jack Rollins is a movie called ""Grain of Sand."" During the in-movie documentary on the life of Jack Rollins we learn about his past experiences and how he came to become an evangelical preacher. All three actors have the most intriguing parts of the film that just suck you in and stay with you long after you see them. Blanchett deserved the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. She's fantastic and gives one of her best performances as she's quickly building a resume that most actresses can't touch, but Bale and Ledger are both equally impressive. <br/><br/>The intertwining stories are done so well and stay so true to the man that Dylan was makes ""I'm Not There"" one of the best films of the year. The constantly changing themes, looks and colors of the film embody Dylan's appearances to perfection. The six characters embody Dylan's schizophrenic like changing of personalities. The historical backdrops used in the film are important and relevant to the times and characters as they add depth and perception to the character's lives. Todd Haynes has created a work that should only get better and more revered as time goes by because we just don't come across films such as this in any time period. Haynes has created a gem to be proud of and a gem that Dylan should be proud of."

She manages to look like Dylan at that time in his life, and she catches hold both of his mannerisms and his off-putting personality. It's more evidence that Blanchett is possibly the most interesting actress in her generation. As for the rest of this film, it ain't worth the considerable trouble it takes to figure it out. A lot of talent is wasted in improbable ways. Also, there's less music than one might expect in a film about one of the great song-writers of the last half-century. I've had the feeling for a long time that the conundrum of Bob Dylan isn't worth penetrating -- and this film does nothing to persuade me otherwise. Two is a generous rating.

I am surprised that Dylan let this go ahead but the money must have been good enough.<br/><br/>This film will not enhance any one's appreciation of the man or his music. Its a trendy arty farty way of exploiting a famous icon with some really crappy acting. Extremely bad taste in casting especially Cate Blanchett who looks far too masculine and heavy jawed to play the young Dylan. Blanchett's interpretation and accent are shockingly bad."
"OutsideHollywoodLand","4","4","5","2 February 2010"," Free-Associating ""I'm Not There""
","Last night, I had the strangest dream. I was going through life as six different aspects of myself! I was famous but not happy, because everyone was misinterpreting what I said, and there was this huge spider walking around...<br/><br/>Long ago, I was one of those flower children who appreciated Bob Dylan's music. Yet, my decision to watch I'm Not There rested solely on the buzz surrounding Cate Blanchett's Oscar-nominated performance as one of his personas.<br/><br/>...That spider! It was a symbol for one of Dylan's albums, ""Tarantula"", right? See, I got it! One major flaw of this movie is that it's awash with symbolic elements that would irritate Dali and perhaps Dylan himself. The pseudo-symbolism is missed if the viewer hasn't followed Dylan's life or his many musical works.<br/><br/>One character was a real cynic, another kind of a lover, then it got confusing with young African-American kid, calling himself Woody Guthrie and some old dude running around, who I think was Billy the Kid? The second weakness of Not There was touted as its greatest strength, where an ensemble cast of no less than six actors portrayed different aspects/life periods of the elusive artist. The biggest performance disappointment was the late Heath Ledger, who essentially was playing himself, all nervous twitches and agonizing over a failed marriage.<br/><br/>...So okay, Billy the Kid was from another album, right? And the dude playing him was supposed to represent his older, wiser self? See what I mean? Richard Gere was absolutely a wasted gesture as the older Dylan, while Christian Bale played the youthful counterpart more convincingly, probably because it was a more direct representation of actual events. (Are the Indie Gods going to strike me down for this?) ...Gee, there were about 15 producers on this movie! Did that make it any better? I wondered which producer decided on the musical choices? Maybe they sat around and said, ""Hey, let's save a few bucks and forego his internationally known classics – you know, the ""All Along the Watchtower"", ""Masters of War"", etc. Instead, let's use his more obscure material – cheap, see?"" How can one show clips of Vietnam and Nixon and not play the aforementioned ""Masters of War"", which is probably the single greatest anti-war song of the whole era? Since one of the main challenges in undertaking a biography of a person's life is giving the audience an accurate accounting, Ms. Blanchett did deserve to win that Oscar! As one aspect of Dylans' elusive personality, she dons his skin and bares his soul for the brief shining moments that she glimmers on the screen. Did she capture the true essence that is - or was at that time - Dylan? Maybe, and then again, maybe not...because who can really translate Dylan's life except the great music man himself.<br/><br/>""Just because you like my stuff doesn't mean I owe you anything.""

","For some odd reason Bob Dylan became the celebrity every celebrity wanted to meet. Since I'm not a Dylan fan I found this motion picture presentation most confusing. So much is taken out of context. The film is like a book of short stories; all poorly written and performed. Cate Blanchett manages to rise above the material and gives this piece of trash some stability and that's not saying much. A total waste of time otherwise.<br/><br/>But wait - I will give a shout out to Marcus Carl Franklin, age ??, 12 or 13 (?) as Woody Guthrie. The photography is also good. I suppose I'm just ""old school"" and am more favorable to a plot with a beginning, middle and end."

","Based on the glowing reports, this is not what I expected. At all! <br/><br/>Just because an ambitious bio-pic aims to portray genius in a arty, quasi-academic, pseudo-genre laden, historical substitute accurate, fawning over genius manner, does not mean that it is to be admired.<br/><br/>The music is great. Bob Dylan has long been acknowledged for his genius. The range of the actors here are no less than astounding. The irony of Heath Ledger, Michelle Williams in a movie replete with songs of sorrow, doom, protest and commercial success .... and eventual transformation. Well, aim high, fall high.<br/><br/>Regrettably, the one big fault of this high work of art. It fails to entertain. My subjective opinion. It is a bore. It is a snore. The music is rightfully fantastic - and I prefer to listen to them on Vinyl, CD, DVD and various video/live performances of Mr. Dylan/Zimmerman himself.<br/><br/>Take out the songs and the music - the film itself. All the kudos - are more for the awe of it all. Dylan performs live to this day - he is a different icon from the years gone by in those days long ago of the nostalgic 1960's going forward.<br/><br/>He himself does not hold himself out as being anything more than he is - which is a lot.<br/><br/>For those than wish some yawning diversion and fine acting. Or Richard Gere on a horse. Or Cate Blanchett marvelously mimicking Dylan as Can Do No Wrong or Juliette Moore as an oh so ennui fill-in for Joan Baez, or the marvelous Christian Bale in one of his poorest performances for an actor for whom poor is better than most. Maybe the worth in this movie is seeing the talent of one Mr. Heath Ledger. Like James Dean before him, he will be rightly remembered for his extreme talent, charisma and tragic early end.<br/><br/>That may be the best and only reason to recommend this film.<br/><br/>Disappointing."

","I found this movie very complicated and confusing. I did not like it. I like Dylan music and was expecting something totally different. The A list cast with Cate Blanchard playing Dylan I thought wow this is going to be a really top movie. I struggled to keep it on for its entire run. I found my mind flicking from wondering what was going on to something I had to do next week at work because it was just not keeping me their. Maybe my long ago uneducated brain was not ready for this but I have read the Cantubury Tales by Chauncer and understood them easier. I know the sixties were for many people a blur of different coloured pills and mind bending drugs. I probably need to get on that wave length and I would give this movie a higher score."

","The Life of bob Dylan, told through the performances of various different actors.<br/><br/>A film is suppose to, among other things, entertain it's viewer on some level. It can be expertly made, well acted and thought-provoking, but if you cannot entertain your audience, what's the point of watching? If I'm not entertained, I lose interest and when I lose interest I get bored. You can have the most unique and complex ideas but if I can't get engaged by anything then again....what's the point. Enter I'm Not There. Well acted by everyone involved, a unique vision and script that is fresh, yet I was bored to tears. Flashes of 2001 come to me.<br/><br/>Thinking of this film, many words come to my mind, pretentious is one of them. Thinking that it is more important then it actually is. I will give it credit for being unique and fresh, but that's it. Todd Haynes clearly had more on his plate then he could handle. Eliminate two of the ""Dylan"" characters, it cuts the running time down, makes things more centred and complete. There, that is one simple solution that would have made the film better. It might have even been able to keep my attention. Who? Well, Richard Gere is the most obvious choice, his segment was the worst of the entire film.<br/><br/>The cast all work well, and Haynes is decent at telling a story, but his ambition got the better of him here. Way too much for him to handle and for the audience. I get the fact that he wanted to tell the audience that bob Dyland can't be understood, but I'm sitting here thinking what was the point of me watching this film. What did I get from it? Nothing.<br/><br/>I know there are fans of this film, my question is are they fans of Dylan? I'm a fan of Dylan and I did not like this movie, not for what is was trying to do, but for what it did, bored me to death."
"m_pooley","3","4","5","23 January 2009"," Pretentious nonsense
","I found this movie to be so much pretentious nonsense. The director is just trying to be too clever and all this movie proves is that some people such as artistes and sports men and women are best appreciated doing what they do rather than what they say or what they write. The director has tried to capture Dylan through the opaque utterances he made in his refusal to be categorised but what we are presented with is dialogue that is far too clever and gnomic for its own good. Yes, the heckler in England did indeed shout ""Judas!"" as a criticism of Dylan going electric, but when Dylan replies ""I don't believe you!"", what on earth does that mean? No, best to appreciate Dylan through his music than through this pseudo-art-house movie."
"bandw","4","4","5","18 November 2008"," Ambitious film that fails
","This is a fictionalized biography based on the life of Bob Dylan. Since Dylan has presented so many faces to the world, the premise of splitting Dylan into six different personas each performed by a different actor is a clever concept. But the presentation is so jumbled and pretentious that it became increasingly more of a chore for me to finish watching this.<br/><br/>I have long appreciated Dylan's music and his way with words and, after having seen this film, I think I should just leave it at that. If you do not know much about Dylan the person, then I think this film will confuse you and leave you cold; if you do have some knowledge of Dylan's life, then I think this film will disappoint you. For example, if you have seen Scorsese's ""No Direction Home,"" you will remember the eloquent interview with Joan Baez there; here we have Julianne Moore standing in for Baez and the interviews with her have none of the emotional power that the real woman conveys. The real Baez comes across as genuine, intelligent, and insightful; Moore comes across as ersatz and shallow. So many times I just wanted to see the real people and not these actors.<br/><br/>In scenes showing the aggressiveness of the interviewers that plagued Dylan, director Haynes totally rips off similar scenes from Fellini's ""8 1/2."" He continues with a Fellini imitation in some of the latter scenes and those scenes I found pretentious and meaningless. Haynes is no Fellini.<br/><br/>We get a good sampling of Dylan's music, some of it sung by Dylan, but too much of it not.<br/><br/>After watching this I pulled out some Dylan recordings and listened to them. What a relief to tap into the real thing without being distracted by this movie."
"Bunuel1976","6","4","5","3 September 2008"," I'M NOT THERE (Todd Haynes, 2007) **1/2
","To begin with, I've been a longtime fan of Bob Dylan's music; I know of the various phases his career took, but still can't consider myself an expert on him  in fact, I haven't watched any of the documentaries about the elusive musician (despite owning DON'T LOOK BACK [1967] on VHS for some time) but did get to see him in three feature films, namely PAT GARRETT AND BILLY THE KID (1973), the concert movie THE LAST WALTZ (1978) and MASKED AND ANONYMOUS (2003).<br/><br/>I was aware of the acclaim garnered by Haynes' fantasia on Dylan's many 'lives' but I have to say I was left disappointed; it's not that I expected the film to be clear-cut or comprehensive (after all, the protagonist is played by six different people!) but, at the end of the day, despite its over-generous length (135 minutes), one has come no closer to understanding the man than he was before  which renders the whole enterprise not only pompous but pointless! Besides, I don't think the film benefited from renaming each personality  we're not talking about David Bowie here!  or, for that matter, some of the milieux in which they 'operated': why make him a movie star, for instance, and what about the black kid or the Western outlaw figure (how was one supposed to connect one with the other unless he knew beforehand they were supposed to be all different facets of the same man)?! <br/><br/>Needless to say, the music is outstanding but, frankly, there's hardly an indication of the impact Dylan's music has had over the years (apart from his early crusading folk period); okay, so the crossover to Electric was initially controversial but it subsequently changed the face of rock music foreverand, yet, Haynes seems to take all of this for granted! Another thing that doesn't work is the decision not to give each personality its own space but rather throw them all into the mix without rhyme or reason; it's a pity, then, that Haynes seems to be catering here merely to the staunchest Dylan connoisseur! <br/><br/>By the way, the acting is variable: Cate Blanchett's much-touted Oscar-nominated performance is good albeit overly mannered, though only Christian Bale (who gets to play two separate incarnations of Dylan) approximates the musician's famously nasal voice; Heath Ledger is typically brooding, but he's matched in his scenes by Charlotte Gainsbourg as the Sara Dylan figure; if anything, Richard Gere is ideally cast as ""Billy The Kid""  but, apart from the undeniable flavor his scenes give the film, they're the most obscure in the whole scheme of things (I do like Roger Ebert's thesis, however, that what was intended here was an allegory about Dylan's perennial search for his true selfor something like that).<br/><br/>Still, perhaps the film's biggest fault is that it's too often a bore  surely, Dylan's real life must have been a lot more compelling than what's depicted/imagined here"
"fwomp","6","4","5","28 July 2008"," Originality Doesn't Translate As ""Great"" Cinema
","Convoluted and questioning, I'M NOT THERE is an insiders take on the life of poet/singer Bob Dylan. And what I mean by ""insiders"" is that if you're not in-the-know of what Bob Dylan was like and how his life meted itself out, you'll probably be scratching your head rather than applauding (with one notable exception which we'll cover in a moment).<br/><br/>Six separate actors (and an actress) portray Dylan as he remakes himself during times of tumult and exacerbation. The first is young black (yes, black) Woody (Marcus Carl Franklin), a train-jumping blues-boy who tries to focus on music of the past rather than the present. When he fails to make it, he must move on and reinvent himself. And the incarnations are many and bewildering (not unlike the man himself). From the pensive Jack (Christian Bale, 3:10 TO YUMA), to the brutally uncompromising Robbie (Heath Ledger, THE DARK KNIGHT), to the solemn Billy (Richard Gere, THE FLOCK), Dylan's music changed with his personae, and a barrage of his songs carry throughout the production.<br/><br/>The big failing of I'm Not There, though, is it's pacing, it's unfocused time-line, and the inability of many watchers to understand where, how, and when we are. Although this style was also a plus in that it created an original format (like Dylan himself), it leant itself to extreme confusion. I hope some people out there aren't watching and raving about it simply because they don't want to be seen as ""musically uneducated"" or ""art handicapped."" Sometimes the ""I don't understand what this was so it must be good"" attitude pops up at times like these. But sometimes confusion is simply that: confusion.<br/><br/>But there is a shining moment that stands out amidst these bizarre sequences, and that radiant star is Cate Blanchett (INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL) as the uneffeminate Jude (Dylan's drug infested wonderlust time). Blanchett's performance was striking in that one never questions her masculinity nor her Dylanesque personae. Her win at the Golden Globes (2008) for Best Supporting Actress was no surprise, nor was her nomination in the same category at the Oscars. Nor her many, many, many, many wins at film festivals across the globe.<br/><br/>I'm giving the film a positive rating based on Blanchett's astounding performance, which blew my mind. I know. I know. I've ""got a lot of nerve."""
"darwinchild03","3","13","23","23 November 2007"," Hapless homage
","Cate Blanchett's and Charlotte Gainsbourg's performances, along with Dylan's actual music, are the only redeeming features (hence one point for each in the rating) of this madwoman's breakfast of a tribute. As a Dylan aficionado, I recognized almost all the material referenced, whether biographical, historical, or musical; but the central conceit of the film, using different actors and multiple pseudonyms for Dylan in his different phases, is as irritating as it is labored. It out-herods Herod, since the re-invention & assumption of guises is well-known to any fan, and therefore redundant; and will be undecipherable to anyone who isn't, and therefore pointless.<br/><br/>Christian Bale, who portrays both the early folk-singing Dylan and the born-again 1979 Dylan, is crushingly awful and miscast, but even more out of place was the ten or eleven-year old black actor who embodies the multitude of fables Dylan wove about himself at the outset of his career.<br/><br/>This vacuous collage seemed twice as long as Martin Scorsese's four-hour documentary treatment of Dylan's career from 1961-1966."

","As an avid Bob Dylan fan I was very exited to see this film. I saw it with a friend of mine who is also very into Dylan however, we both drew the same conclusion: we were very disappointed.<br/><br/>To start, if you've seen ""Don't Look Back"" of ""No Direction Home"" you will realize that this film has many parts which just mirror those films. I did think Cate Blanchette did very well, but then again all she really had to do was watch don't look back a bunch and mirror Dylan from that documentary. (I'm not saying I could have done it) Also, the whole Basement Tapes / Pat Garret & Billy the Kid Bob Dylan with Richard Geere made little sense to any of us, I saw what they were trying to do I just wasn't about it.<br/><br/>I guess I'm just a disappointed super-fan and I would probably find a problem with any Dylan movie that came out. This one was just particularly below my expectations. My favorite part had to be the 30 seconds of Dylan actually playing the harmonica at the end, that almost made the trip worth my ticket price. I also did like some of the takes on Dylan songs represented in the soundtrack.<br/><br/>I feel like I'm crazy because everyone raves about this movie. I think some of them just don't see whats going on and think it's good because it's ""artsy""... Does anyone agree at all? Shoot me a message if so, or even if you don't I really want to talk about this."
"MightyAlz","5","5","7","19 January 2008"," I made a prediction about this film when I first heard about it...
","I said it sounded like the most pretentious film ever made.<br/><br/>So I just saw it. And I was right.<br/><br/>It was a pseudo-mystical vanity project that sensationalised so many real events and turned them into ludicrousness. The whole thing was an insane caricature.<br/><br/>Also, the various plot lines simply did not fit - they bared no relation to one another; half were totally fictional and half were semi-fictional and this did not work.<br/><br/>Plenty of irritating, cringe-worthy in-jokes (""hey, man she's JUST LIKE A WOMAN"" - real subtle) that will make fans wince and be meaningless to non-fans.<br/><br/>They blend the barrier between fiction and non-fiction to the point where it just becomes confusing and pointless - some characters are pseudonyms for others, such as Julianne Moore playing Joan Baez's alter-ego, but some just appear straight, like Allen Ginsberg. It simply makes no sense and also occasionally suffers from typical ""of-its-era"" biopic problems, where numerous famous figures just happen to appear so as to emphasise the time and place.<br/><br/>It reminded me VERY strongly of Oliver Stone's ridiculous film, The Doors - an over-bearing work of idol-worship which distorts facts under the banner of being an ""ART"" film.<br/><br/>However, just like that film, this film did have some positive points. The acting was flawless - Cate Blanchett deserves a nomination for her performance, for sure. And visually, it was terrific - particularly the ludicrous swinging 60's bachelor pad where images just appear at random on the walls. And of course, the music's great stuff.<br/><br/>But the problem is that a lot of this stuff actually is documented - what was the point of exaggeration the famous ""JUDAS"" scene to the point of stupidity, or turning the cranking-up at Newport into a riot, when there is already actual footage of the events which reveal it to be nothing like it is shown? It's trying to make a big deal out of something which is not.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm not going to conclude the review, because I can't be bothered. Just re-read the rest and chop out the dull bits."
"jaibo","10","8","13","7 January 2008"," Got there
","I awaited this with great anticipation and a little trepidation, but the film is better than I or anyone could have hoped - certainly one of the films of the decade so far, and one of the best films ever made not merely about a rock star (there's not much competition there anyway!) but about an artist of any kind.<br/><br/>Six actors play versions of Dylan - some fantasy figures, others relatively accurate biographical portraits, others a mixture of gossip, myth and fanciful conjecture. The simple point to all of this is that Dylan is so complex a public persona that it would be reductive to reduce him to a single performance - he has given many performances in his time, and therefore Haynes' multi-casting is a perfect solution to a knotty problem.<br/><br/>I agree with most of the reviews that Cate Blanchet as Jude, the mid-60s acid queen Dylan, is a fantastic performance. I am in disagreement with the critics who dislike the Richard Gere sections, with this actor as a Dylan called Billy walking through a town of his own imagining called Riddle, which is where the extraordinary ordinary folk live and which is threatened by the corporate forces of that old man (Pat) Garrett. This section does an unbelievably sophisticated job of interweaving the meanings of both Dylan's involvement in Peckinpah's Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid (in which Dylan is Alias!!!) and the songs on Dylan and The Band's famous Basement Tape. The reading of the Basement Tape songs - as an apocalyptic vision of an America in its death throes - owes something to Greil Marcus' excellent Invisible Republic, and hats off to Haynes for recognising Marcus' book as one of the pre-eminent readings of Dylan's work. The Billy section features a deep and beautiful cover version of the Basement Tape song Going' To Acapulco by Jim James & Calexico, one of moments in the film which hit the emotional me square in the heart and drew tears to my eyes.<br/><br/>Delueze in Cinema 1 suggests that motion pictures are about showing us segments of change whilst suggesting a whole which is not present in the film but implied. Which makes I'm Not There the very essence of cinema..."
"nelliewilson","Null","2","2","27 June 2011"," Major Disappointment.
","The films idea is pretty solid. Dylan has so many sides to him that he is round. A blues musician said that about him in 1964. Sadly, the execution of the concept fails. And the writing is equally as bad. Perhaps some of you enjoyed the movie but I saw it as a complete failure. The feeling I was left with after the film made me dislike Dylan...even though he's been my inspiration for so many years. I've read over twenty biographies of him as well as his his own 'Chronicles Vol. 1' and nothing within the film demonstrates what he contributed to music. <br/><br/>The actors did a fairly good job with what they had. The writing is so far off and only distracts from the real story. The concept was good but the directing falls short and doesn't stand out in any way. If you are at all interested in Dylan and his art, watch 'Don't Look Back' or 'Renaldo and Clara'. The latter is a bit zany but shows a real side to Dylan and his friends."

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","5","2","2","18 November 2008"," Very unique story structure makes for great scenes but a bizarre whole
","""I'm Not There"" is in every way an art film. The concept alone of having several actors play characters resembling Bob Dylan at different stages/re-inventions of his career warrants the label ""art film."" Of course that wasn't enough--theses different stages don't occur in basic chronological order, they are broken into pieces and mixed around with each other, jumping back and forth. Oh, and they're all told differently--one in documentary style, one in more traditional style, one in black and white...it's continuity's worst nightmare.<br/><br/>Films that are so structurally rebellious can often be surprisingly good, but if you're largely unfamiliar with Dylan's life it's hard to ever be completely on board with the film. I'm not a Dylan fan, not that I wouldn't want to be, but not yet at least, and I know that I was pretty lost. This movie is anything but what the modern term ""biopic"" encapsulates. It dared to be different, radically so and maybe creator Todd Haynes was right--the last thing Hollywood needs is another traditional musician biopic.<br/><br/>The times that I enjoyed this film were during individual scenes. The variety of talented actors (Christian Bale, Heath Ledger, Cate Blanchett) made them all particularly interesting, it was just when I tried to draw some connection between them that my brain got absolutely fried. I also found the film very visually interesting in all its different modes, so credit Haynes in that sense.<br/><br/>Overall, ""I'm Not There"" has to rank in the top most uniquely told biographies. In fact for now, it's probably right up at number one. You simply can't see this film expecting to not do your end of the work. You can't just hit play with this one--bring your A game and brush up on your Dylan beforehand."

""I'm Not There"" is a jumbled up, random collection of unrelated scenes, making no sense individually or combined.

"southworth-paul","2","7","12","4 January 2008"," Very disappointing
","As a big Bob Dylan fan, I was really looking forward to this film. I was very disappointed. It was too long and far too pretentious. It was even worse for friends who were not familiar with some of the more obscure aspects of Dylan's life. There are large chunks of the film which simply make no sense if you don't know about the situation they're representing.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the 'version' of Dylan represented by the young black ""Woody Guthrie"" boy. That particular part was well thought out and well-acted and the music was certainly the best in the movie. I also thought the ""Arthur Rimbaud"" character made sense, though this was a very minimal part of the film. However, the rest of the movie was absolute tripe.<br/><br/>Cate Blanchett played the part of 1965/6 Dylan fantastically, adopting the mannerisms expertly, but the dialogue she had to utter was atrocious as were the situations in which the character was put. The section of the film set in England, including the ""Don't Look Back"" part, was absolutely appalling. Aside from the man playing the Albert Grossman character and Bruce Greenwood's depiction of a cynical journalist, the acting of the smaller parts was abysmal. England was filled with terrible actors with, on the whole, terrible fake posh-English accents.<br/><br/>Richard Gere's ""Billy the Kid"" aspect of the film lacked any impact at all and seemed quite pointless. Heath Ledger's section had slightly more to it, assumedly representing Bob Dylan's romantic life with Suze Rotolo and Sara Dylan as well as his family life, but was ultimately dull and inconsequential. As for Christian Bale's performance, it was horrible. The man sounded like some sort of comedy caricature of Bob Dylan - done badly. His acting was equally atrocious.<br/><br/>If you're a big Bob Dylan fan like myself, you might get a little something out of it. Especially enjoyment of the Woody Guthrie character. You may also enjoy Cate Blanchett's depiction of Dylan with its accurate mannerisms. However, I don't think it's really worth 135 minutes of your time. If you're not a Bob Dylan fan, I really wouldn't bother. You're not going to gain anything from it and I doubt you'd enjoy it."

","I'm Not There (2007)<br/><br/>So startling in its invention, so beautiful and stunning the photography and acting, and so appropriate for its subject, Bob Dylan, why does it not quite hold water?<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I love the movie, the music, and Cate Blanchett equally. It has an extraordinary logic to its many many parts, as well, making not only a fanciful (downright surreal) patchwork of a movie, but a reasonable commentary on the true life Dylan. I could and will watch it again.<br/><br/>If you don't know much about Bob Dylan, or don't like his music, I have to say the odds are against you here. If there ever was a movie filled with references (many of them highly symbolic and distant, veiled even), this is it. Even if you like Dylan you might find it hard to follow, so you need to enjoy just sitting back and going for the ride. I'm not sure getting stoned first would help in this case because it's so disorienting at times.<br/><br/>Advice for the uninitiated? Read a quick bio of Dylan (Wikipedia might work) and get a sense of at least these core moments: 1) he visited Woody Guthrie on his death bed and was playing folk songs in a traditional vein, 2) he modernized when he moved to the Village, still keeping the folk sound with edgy new lyrics (and this is when he met Joan Baez), 3) he shocked everyone when he went electric at a folk festival (actually at Newport), 4) he was in a near fatal motorcycle accident in 1966 5) he took on a cowboy persona for his 1967 album, John Wesley Harding. That should help with some orientation for the different characters and scenes.<br/><br/>For those who are right for the film, including no doubt the director Todd Haynes, who got Dylan's approval for the project ahead of time, this will be a memorable experience."

"martys-7","5","5","8","30 November 2007"," Intermittenly Fascinating Failure, Dylan Deserves Better
","Todd Haynes' brilliant idea to explore Bob Dylan's psychic personas through six different actors portraying parallel lives makes sense in light of this artist's evolution from ragamuffin folkie to psyched-out rocker to country crooner to Christian rocker to American music elder troubadour. Alas, despite its vision, the film eventually crumbles due to its length, artistic pretentiousness, and emptiness, although some of its acting and cinematography save it from being a complete failure.<br/><br/>Cate Blanchett is easily the best actor of the group giving a stellar performance as the mid-60s Dylan - the artist as a young pop star, cynical, dissolute, and tripped-out, living in a Fellini's ""8 & 1/2"" reality (Haynes even uses Nino Rota's score at one point). Blanchett brings out the conflict between artist and public into plain view as an open wound but this pathos is not further explored other than in that passage. Young Marcus Carl Franklin provides another excellent performance as Dylan incarnated as a runaway black boy hopping trains with its guitar emulating his hero Woody Guthrie. The other four Dylans do not add much: Christian Bale is the earnest protest folkie who becomes a Christian preacher; Heath Ledger is the failed husband, womanizing movie star; Ben Whishaw is a motormouth pseudo French poet Rimbaud; Richard Gere is an aging Billy the Kid living in a parallel universe's Wild West. Any Dylan mythologist or even casual fana who listen to his music and know a thing or two about Dylan are aware that he started as a folkie, converted to Christianity at one point, had women, and admired two 19th century icons: rebellious teen French poet Rimbaud and American West teen outlaw Billy the Kid, so there are no revelations here. To make matters worst, the four actors'performances are rather perfunctory.<br/><br/>There are brilliant scenes effortlessly blending American West wilderness, Fellinesque surrealism, and New York street grittiness, but eventually they become tedious, gimmicky, as the film does not have anything to say other than rehash well known Dylan tales through a loopy, pseudo stream of consciousness narrative. It never provides the viewer with a fresh vision or insight of Dylan as a creative soul. Its emptiness becomes evident and its gimmickry cannot save it. Surely Dylan deserves better."

It is interesting sure, with a unique and quite bold concept, but it doesn't come off completely successfully. There are things to appreciate but it is understandable why some may dislike it, it's pretty divisive as a film.<br/><br/>Starting with 'I'm Not There's' good points, it is beautifully and atmospherically made and adeptly directed by Todd Haynes. Dylan's music is just great and beautifully incorporated and interpreted.<br/><br/>A big strength is the cast, a vast majority of them giving strong performances. Cate Blanchett, barely recognisable, is particularly excellent, with Christian Bale, Marcus Carl Franklin and Heath Ledger more than up to her level. There are some entertaining secondary performances from Charlotte Gainsbourg, David Cross and Julianne Moore. Dylan is remarkably multi-faceted, where we see him as a rebellious poet, a protest singer, a drug-addled rock star, a matinée idol with marriage woes, and a born-again Christian.<br/><br/>Not everything works. The concept does intrigue, but the time shifts do feel muddled and confusing. 'I'm Not There' is overlong with it going longer than necessary and the pacing rambles making the film drag.<br/><br/>While most of the cast are great, Richard Gere and his story are tacked on and uninteresting and Ben Whishaw is a little dull. The script could have been tighter and more cohesive.<br/><br/>Overall, not awful but underwhelming and easy to see why it's a divisive film. Bob Dylan deserved better than this. 5/10 Bethany Cox"
"DICK STEEL","6","3","4","10 April 2008"," A Nutshell Review: I'm Not There
","I've got to admit that I'm not a Bob Dylan fan, and neither do I know enough of the man and his music. The only reason why I opted to watch I'm Not There, is undeniably because of the stellar cast attached to the project. Especially so when you have Cate Blanchett who got an Academy nomination for her role and I just wanted to fins out why, as well as the first pairing (well, not quite) of both Christian Bale and the late Heath Ledger on screen, though they never share the same frame.<br/><br/>I only know enough to get by, that the different actors who get assigned to play Dylan related roles, be it through references of song, or characters through movies, make this movie seem quite all over the place, and therein lies the catch - how do you personify a living musical legend on the big screen, one who probably has so many facets to his life, that is near impossible for one actor to portray? So I guess Todd Haynes built multiple personalities around the Dylan motif, and see how they went.<br/><br/>For most of the movie, you can treat it like a short film, each with different actors at the helm of a Dylan-related character, holding court, with couple of recognizable celebrities making cameo appearances, and though what I thought was interesting, was that Bale had 2 segments given to him, one near the beginning where he gets to showcase his singing voice, and the other one right at the end. Again Bale goes through a physical transformation that you'd probably do a double take just to convince yourself that it is him under the guise.<br/><br/>Other than that, Heath Ledger's role I thought was the simplest to follow, as it centers on the love life of an actor. Despite these highlights and the other supporting acts, Cate Blanchett really showed who was in command, as her role was really very trippy even for my liking, but made it a whole lot of fun just to watch her in action - you might even wonder what kind of medication she was on to put on a performance like that.<br/><br/>I really wasn't quite right there with the movie, so if I were to round up a final statement, it would be that this movie is suited for Bob Dylan fans as you can probably go ballistic with the number of references loaded in this film, or if you're really keen, to do a lot of research by reading up the life of the man, and of course to listen to his music, in order to get something meaningful and rich out of it."
"marissas75","6","3","4","4 January 2008"," Preaches to the choir of Dylan fans
","""I'm Not There,"" Todd Haynes' meditation on Bob Dylan's many facets, never mentions Dylan by name, preferring allusion and metaphor instead. Judging by the amount of 10-star ratings this movie has received here on the IMDb, it seems to have found an admiring audience, but I'd bet that most of them are Dylan fans who understand what Haynes is trying to say. I'm a little different: though I very much respect Dylan as a songwriter and musician, I was born in the 1980s, and thus missed all of the cultural moments that Haynes alludes to. As a result, I think my appreciation of the movie was severely diminished.<br/><br/>Haynes does have a reputation for making intellectual or postmodern films, but I feel like that got the better of him here. I loved his ""Far From Heaven"" because it wasn't merely clever; it made me emotionally involved with the characters and story. ""I'm Not There"" has fewer emotional moments, and even when I started to feel connected to certain characters, I constantly wondered, ""Why is he showing me this? What does this have to do with the rest of the movie, or with Dylan? Is there some hidden meaning I'm not getting?"" <br/><br/>For instance, one of the movie's Dylan incarnations is an 11-year-old African-American hobo, played by Marcus Carl Franklin. Franklin has lots of personality and is fun to watch, but still is almost overshadowed by his character's metaphorical, cultural, and historical ""significance."" And the film's most thoroughly explored relationship is the troubled marriage of actor Robbie (Heath Ledger) and painter Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg) but that seemed like outtakes from a different story, that of the celebrity who abandons his wife when he gets famous. At least this segment had fewer obscure Dylan references.<br/><br/>I admired much of the acting and Haynes' ability to give each segment a different look and feel, but often I wondered whether I wouldn't have been better off buying a few more Dylan albums and reading something about the real Dylan instead. For example, I really enjoyed Cate Blanchett's performance as the jittery, sneering, gnomic ""Jude Quinn""--she does a great job of being incredibly charismatic and incredibly off-putting at once. But if her mannerisms and some of her dialogue were copied from the Dylan documentary ""Don't Look Back,"" as is apparently the case, should I have just watched that instead? <br/><br/>Then there are certain aspects that don't work at all. One Dylan incarnation, ""Arthur Rimbaud"" (Ben Whishaw) is just on hand to make enigmatic pronouncements. Another, ""Billy the Kid"" (Richard Gere), shows up in a segment full of if-Fellini-were-American images (à la Tim Burton's ""Big Fish""). This is the kind of literal-minded recreation of Dylan's surreal lyrics that made the Broadway musical ""The Times They Are A-Changin'"" such a notorious flop, and it just feels like padding here.<br/><br/>""I'm Not There"" is partially about Dylan's complex relationship with his fans--his desire to keep changing his image, upsetting people's preconceived notions and refusing to preach to the choir. It's too bad, then, that ""I'm Not There"" is the definition of a preaching-to-the-choir film: probably satisfying for Dylan obsessives, but too cryptic for us Dylan rookies."

","""I'm Not There"" is an unenlightening, well-heeled, sophomoric interpretation of Bob Dylan, that borders on parody when compared to the films ""Don't Look Back"", ""The Other Side of the Mirror"" & ""Renaldo and Clara"". I hope that people unfamiliar with the works of Bob Dylan will be motivated to further explore Dylan's music, writings and films. If ""I'm Not There"" causes people to explore the works of Bob Dylan, then this film will have found it's redemption. Technically the film is excellent, great photography by Ed Lachman and great sound. The pace of the film is uneven, at times tedious. The performances are fascinating just for the idea of actors playing Bob Dylan. If you are at all familiar with the real Bob Dylan, all of the performances fall short of representing the enigmatic Dylan except for Marcus Carl Franklin who plays Bob Dylan and Woody. In general the performances were shallow and did not connect emotionally. There is no doubt that the real Bob Dylan will be the primary attraction of ""I'm Not There"" and he's not there. What was Todd Haines' motivation in making this film beyond having the right to do so?"

","This movie was just O.K. for me. I am a huge Bob Dylan fan and didn't really like the way they portrayed his life. Especially since they changed his name, profession, and even his album names. I thought they should've just went through his life without all the weird switching between characters and actors. I thought the only two good Bob Dylan performances were Cate Blanchette and Ben Wishaw. Especially Ben Wishaw, he looked and sounded just like Bob Dylan. Cate Blanchette did good, not great, job at portraying Dylan. I also thought they should've made it to where the actor sings all the time. But They can't really do that when they have seven people playing the same guy. Which is where I thought they went wrong. They needed to just do a movie ABOUT Bob Dylan's life, not inspired by it. This was really only an artsy-fartsy movie, not a story. One thing I hated about the movie was Richard Gere, that whole section was pointless and confusing. The whole movie was confusing really. I know BOb Dylan was a confusing guy, but show it in a way that says he's confusing and no one understands him, don't be confusing altogether. I don't even know why they said it was a movie inspired by Bob Dylan. The only two characters that were inspired by him were Cate Blanchette and Ben Wishaw. Every one else was like a different character entirely. I didn't really like it. Now, as a movie, it was cool to watch. The story was messed up, but it was cool to watch. If you're an artsy-fartsy person and want to watch an artsy-fartsy movie, see I'm Not There."

","Unless you know a lot about Bob Dylan and the context in which he lived - Vietnam War, folk music ... - you will be completely lost while watching this film. I went into it knowing virtually nothing about him, and really learned nothing from watching this. In fact, after about an hour, I think I slipped into unconsciousness a few times, wondering if I had been reborn in one of the 16 hell realms. I went for two reasons - Christian Bale and Cate Blanchett. Bale, at least in the beginning, was really only used in still photographs and Blanchett appeared after about one hour of absolute tedium. Her appearance livened things up, but really what does that mean? It's interesting to read through these reviews, because most of the British posters are in-line with what I'm saying, and the Americans are fawning all over this film. I'm not sure why, but maybe they are die-hard Todd Haynes fans, Bob Dylan fanatics, or being paid by the studio. Had I rented this pretentious piece of crap, I would have switched it off after about 10 minutes, seeing that it was going absolutely nowhere and making no sense. Or I would have looked under the title menu, found the few scenes, starring the actors I was interested in, and then switched it off. If you enjoyed films such as Last Days, another horrible exercise in film-making, then you might love I'm Not Here. I wish I hadn't been there - watching this film."
"danpfau","3","7","13","5 December 2007"," A Dylan fan's perspective
","Put simply, I'm Not There is a disappointment of a film. While the idea is brilliant--the six actor portrayal of one man, Dylan--it does not make up for the fact that the film has a pretty bad script. It seems to me the film acquired such talented actors solely based on the fact that they were offered an opportunity to play such an emblematic enigma. Haynes was correct assuming a traditional bio-pic treatment of Dylan's life would not capture the man himself and would have probably let down more fans than this film, but a little more coherence and storyline would have done this film a solid.<br/><br/>As for the Dylan references, I got them. I've read Chronicle and Scaduto's biography, I've listened to every album, bootlegs, Tarantula, etc. They were kind of too obvious. I felt like the lyric lines were really...stupid. I mean, after a woman smashed the glass vase on the head of a deranged hotel steward, Cate Blanchett's line ""Just Like a Woman!""? Come on.<br/><br/>I think a film focusing only on the Heath Ledger/Charlotte Gainsbourg story would have been a much better movie and the Dylan story could have been contained within that frame. Had it been fleshed out, the naive youngster Dylan, the fledgling superstar Dylan, the pompous self-involved Dylan, the disillusioned Dylan, the retrospective Dylan, they could have all been seen in that one story and it would have been a whole hell of a lot more relatable.<br/><br/>Overall, it's worth seeing just to see Dylan's ""life"" as a movie, but I will always remember it as a disappointing experience. Hopefully, someday someone will take elements of this and a better script and make a better movie."

This one is a grandiose turd.<br/><br/>Where do I begin? I own 18 Bob Dylan albums. I play the guitar and sing and I learned to play by learning Dylan songs.

I can hardly begin to describe how awful ""I'm Not There"" is. We have a young black kid named Woody Guthrie who plays the guitar and sings, he obviously is supposed to represent young Bob. Then there is Christian Bale, Heath Ledger, and the god awful Cate Blanchett. They all are supposed to represent different sides of Dylan, but none of them are named Bob Dylan. It is all so phony and poorly done that it made my head spin. Blanchett's impersonation of Dylan was just that, something like Frank Caliendo doing Al Pacino. Laughable! The icing on the cake was how we spend almost an hour basically re-enacting the amazing documentary ""Don't Look Back"" but with Blanchett hamming it up the entire time, reciting lines that Dylan said in ""Don't Look Back"" and just being generally weird. I was horrified! The worst thing about this film is that it attempts to disguise itself as this 'independent artsy, gritty film' but it is just more of the same Weinstein Company run of the mill trash that keeps churning out of that disgusting machine and this time they managed to ruin an amazing artist in the process for many young people. I hope they rot in hell for that.<br/><br/>The only redeeming thing about ""I'm Not There"" was the only thing that is truly Bob Dylan and that was the soundtrack.<br/><br/>A real fan of Bob Dylan will HATE this 'film.' 1 out of 10, kids."

I own every piece of Dylan music, video and film that I can and will ever get my hands on. This movie does it's job portraying the surrealistic aura that is Bob Dylan, along with a decent sampling of music from his various incarnations. While it would be hard for me not to enjoy something Dylan of this magnitude, I can't say that I was even nearly overwhelmed like most of the posts I've read here. I simply left the theatre with much imagery in my mind along with sound sensations and Dylan personas floating around. It didn't have the dramatic or emotional impact for me that I had hoped.<br/><br/>Frankly, I may be one of the few that would still like to see something more akin to a movie biographic portrayal that contains the same artistic integrity but shows a direct timeline and all the changing personas in a more direct fashion. I feel the world/nation really needs something of this fashion to really hit hard the LEGEND that is Bob Dylan in sound, life, philosophy, and attitude. For Bob Dylan is a shining testament to truth and direct plain-speak about life and living. I for one would get goosebumps if something more lifelike could be portrayed for the ages in bringing this all together. While ""I'm Not There"" certainly can be seen as an artistic product, it doesn't capture the real Bob Dylan and his message as I'd like to see it.

","I'm Not There ""Everybody knows I'm not a folk singer."" So claims Bob Dylan by one of the six interpreters of his persona in Todd Haynes' stylistic, impressionistic I'm not There. This quote clarifies what isn't in this biopic, the real Bob Dylan; the title gives a clue to the imprecise biography but suggests the intriguing format in which disparate actors, from Heath Ledger on one end to Cate Blanchett on the other, play at different times in his life a person never called Bob Dylan.<br/><br/>There's plenty to enjoy, for instance Alan Ginsberg asking a statue of crucified Christ, ""Why don't you do your early stuff?"" Or Blanchett's spot on imitation of the late-60's rocker with curly hair and epigrammatic responses. Although she gets closest to the Dylan I remember, I figured out that I don't know the troubadour any better now than I did before the film. But, then, why should IWho really knew Elvis? The universal appeal of these icons like Dylan is that they appeal to something a little different in each generation and maybe each person; with such wide-ranging influence, that they remain inscrutable is a natural concomitant to the impression on each soul.<br/><br/>Because Dylan is a true shape shifter, from protester par excellence to current X-M Radio disc jockey (not in the film), Haynes has done an inventive turn on a genre that could use his renovation. Yes, I would like to know the inner workings of genius, but these biographies rarely if ever give it to me, so Haynes' wildly interpreting, right up to an outrageous parallel to Billy the Kid (Richard Gere), satisfies my inclination to the impressionistic and lack of historical fact retention. The film is really an abstraction of feeling that militates against knowing the subject at all. But then, who knows anything about Dylan but his style anyway?

The Richard Gere scenes are completely unnecessary, meandering and take much away from the film, not that it is his fault as an performer. It's just a poor idea.

However, do not say that I do not have justification in finding the Bob Dylan semi-autobiographical film ""I'm Not There"" an exercise in extreme ridiculousness. Director Todd Haynes presents ruminations on the life of Bob Dylan through different eccentric characters: a rambling interviewee Arthur Rimbaud (Ben Winshaw), a hardcore folkie musician Jack Rollins (Christian Bale), a man of the small village wild Billy The Kid (Richard Gere), a gabby black child Woody Guthrie (Marcus Carol Franklin), a successful actor-musician Robbie Clark (Heath Ledger), and a vociferous ""play by my own rules"" musician Jude Quinn (Cate Blanchett). Haynes presents us mosaics of their lives and asks us via cinema to compare it to Dylan's musical and personal background. Note to Haynes: Not everybody is an obsessed Dylan film like you Todd! Maybe Dylan has his ""Haynes"" on or visa-versa, but I do not partake in the ""underwear"" I mean underbelly of that musical environment. The performances from the actors were decent Dylan subliminal portrayals but without a doubt the one that will cross your mind a few times was the phenomenal performance of Cate Blanchett as Quinn.

Funny thing is, the first scene of the movie is already a metaphor of some sort.<br/><br/>Acting wise, the ensemble is satisfactory, surprising because they're all actors who have good resumes. Cate Blanchett's gender-bending performance (Yeah, SHE is also Bob Dylan) is good and her mannerisms were on the spot but one can't help but notice that it is too gimmicky. For me, the stand out is the child actor Marcus Carl Franklin who played it simple yet it's effective.<br/><br/>All in all, I guess that this movie HAS the potential to be not way your typical musical biopic should be. The ideas were convincing, the concept was good, they're trying to make it artistic, I get that, but when you see the results, it was scattered, ambitious, and too over the top.<br/><br/>I appreciated Todd Haynes' effort to go on a different route but sadly, this one didn't work for me."
"blsflnthng13","5","4","7","27 November 2007"," Ambiguous, Decietful, but nonetheless Dylan
","I am a large Dylan fan, and i love watching well produced independent films just as much as the next vagabond, but in this case the two don't mix all too well. Haynes from the start has obviously well interpreted the life of the infamous and controversial folk singer, and from that derived a great production plan for his film through the script, editing, and (possibly the best thing about the film) the acting. The only problem is, he forgot to take into account that the audience will not have a copy of Dylans autobiography in their lap while watching the film. Between the names of characters, their counterparts, the sequencing differential of chronological truth, and the cut sequencing, i sat through this film squirming in my seat. I regret now not having waited for video release, as the pause and rewind buttons would have come quite in handy, yet as of this point i have ruined it for myself and doubt that i will take the time to sit through this again. The problem is, with a little exception towards Gere's 'Billy the Kid' mash up, the characters are little explained but overly developed. You leave the theater with a sense of Dylan's life-long ambiguity, but only in the most abstract of senses, with Little fact and little insurance that what you processed in your head was anything like what the director was truly trying to convey. At the movies end, i was confused about everything i had just seen, only with exception to Dylan's periodical philosophy. The director had the right idea. Yet, despite his attempts to parallel the films confused and frenzied state to the mind of the legendary Dylan, he could have kept his artistic character parallels and insanely disorderly flashbacks somewhat more relevant to Dylan, if only for a little less indecisive and more thoughtful explanation."

","Todd Haynes's fictionalized Bob Dylan biopic has finally arrived. And it's a good one. Like Dylan's autobiography ""Chronicles"", it's told in stream of consciousness style. The many different people playing the role (and each person gives the character a different name) stress the many alter egos that inhibit this richly complex character. The character's speed and marijuana usage give the whole movie a very dreamlike state. One can imagine that he probably gets tired of reporters always asking him stupid questions, and that it contributes to the bizarre mental state that we see.<br/><br/>But anyway, this is certainly one that I recommend. Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett, Richard Gere, Heath Ledger, Ben Whishaw, and newcomer Marcus Carl Franklin all show themselves to be very adept at playing the role. If this movie doesn't get at least one Oscar nomination, I'll have to question the Academy's judgment. Really magnificent.<br/><br/>Also starring Julianne Moore, Charlotte Gainsbourg, Bruce Greenwood and Richie Havens."
"intelearts","10","5","10","14 December 2007"," How to peel a pomegranate...
","Without a doubt one of the better films ever about music. I think back to others that have tried before: ""A star is born"", ""Saturday Night Fever"", ""Coal Miner's Daughter"", Milos Forman's ""Hair"", ""Ray"", ""Walk The Line"", even ""Amadeus"" , and really none take both the film and the music and fly with it the way that ""I'm not there"" does.<br/><br/>It is a powerful evocation of what Dylan means: to a generation, to a listener, to the heart. It is made with deep thought, a light touch, and great skill.<br/><br/>What makes this shine for my money is the combination of performance and expert directorship. This is not MTV video: it looks, feels, and sounds like mature film. It elicited a response from this viewer that has been missing all year in other films, for the way it is shot, paces, framed, lit, and sounds - and was dramatically different from the usual fare that is wholly linear or retreads others' ideas.<br/><br/>There is an aura of unique and original here and that makes it stand out clearly from the pack.<br/><br/>The blessing of Dylan is there is so much to choose from - and therein lies the curse. Here we get the blessing: by covering the psyche and not the psychology we end up with a feast not a blow-out. Shot in a series of characters we find the different persona that Dylan foisted on the eager and not so eager public played out by a host of different actors and actresses that capture the zeitgeist near perfectly.<br/><br/>It deserves awards and accolades. Quite simply one of the best music biography I have ever seen; and if you argue that it isn't a biography then you miss the point entirely - a beautiful, complex, and impish tribute to the man who cannot be pinned down.<br/><br/>And why my title: well, apart from the obvious multi-faceted, you can only really successfully peel a pomegranate one way. Otherwise you end up with a sticky mess and broken seeds. But I'm not telling you how....<br/><br/>Just left to quote Ramblin' Jack Elliot on the album ""A Nod To Bob"":<br/><br/>Happy (?th) Birthday, Bob."

","This movie jumps back and forth between six personalities supposed to represent Bob Dylan. Woody Guthrie is an 11-year-old African American hobo. Arthur Rimbaud (Ben Whishaw) is a teenage poet. Jack Rollins (Christian Bale) sings with Alice Fabian (Julianne Moore) in the 60's protesting the war. Robbie Clark (Heath Ledger) plays Jack Rollins in a biography. Jude Quinn (Cate Blanchett) is a folk singer who starts playing the electric guitar. Billy McCarty (Richard Gere) is secretly the outlaw Billy the Kid.<br/><br/>The most compelling performance and the most audacious attempt belongs to Cate Blanchett. I wouldn't mind a whole movie with Blanchett as Dylan. The way this movie works is very random and artsy. I would prefer concentrating on any one of the personalities rather than following all six. It's ambitious but it's structurally scattered."
"gradyharp","10","3","5","7 May 2008"," A Successful Exploration and Cinematic Investigation of an Artist
","I'M NOT THERE is clearly not a movie for everyone. The concept of the film is experimental, the execution of the 'documentary' is actually an amalgam of the aura and influence of one man in the music world instead of a linear history of a famous singer/poet, and the goal seems more to find the effect of Bob Dylan's chameleon persona on those people with whom he came into contact than it is to relate the story of a fascinating and important American artist. <br/><br/>Writer (with Oren Moverman) and Director Todd Haynes ('Far from Heaven', 'Velvet Goldmine') has gathered images, memorabilia, fragments of interviews, and responses from acquaintances and from these he has pieced together a quilt-like panorama of the enigmatic, elusive, ever-changing Bob Dylan. The result is not meant to be a precise history, but instead a 'feeling' for the man who so profoundly influenced American music in the 1960s. Haynes selected several top actors to inhabit various aspects of Dylan's life and times. The Narrator for this both black and white and color film is symbolist poet Arthur Rimbaud (Ben Winshaw) who through a series of comments opens the vignettes that reflect Dylan. Eleven- year-old Marcus Carl Franklin radiates the energy of Woody Guthrie when he is suggesting the early formative influences of Dylan. Christian Bale becomes 'Jack Rollins', among the closest of the actors to impersonate the performing Dylan. Heath Ledger embodies the love- life side of Dylan's character with the Claire of Charlotte Gainsbourg while Cate Blanchett comes closest to showing us the inverted personality as Jude Quinn - the name assigned to the character who most resemble Dylan's appearance and talk and physical reactions to the public, the press, and the audience. And as an homage to Dylan's preoccupation with history, the final version of Dylan becomes Billy the Kid (Richard Gere) in the surreal town of Riddle. Other important characters pass through this musical mélange - Julianne Moore comments as Alice Fabian, a Joan Baez-type figure, Michelle Williams becomes Coco for a moment, and Bruce Greenwood has double roles suggesting influences from the height of Dylan's career to his old age. <br/><br/>Throughout the film the music of Bob Dylan pervades the soundtrack, the tunes as important as the timely poetry of his lyrical output. The film is as strange as the man who inspired it, and Todd Haynes and his amazing cast of actors give us an impressive slice of our history as well as an appreciation of the aura of the strangely haunting Bob Dylan. In extended featurettes on the CD the director and cast give wonderful insights both into the character of Dylan as well as the concept of creating this amazing film. For some, watching these introductions BEFORE watching the actual movie may enhance appreciation of this art piece. Highly recommended - but the audience must understand this is not a routine movie!

","Who is Bob Dylan? What is Bob Dylan? Poet, author, actor, revolutionary, genius, freak or simply a constant reinvention by one Robert Alan Zimmerman. Whatever he is and was and will be is a question that people have been trying to answer from the first time he appeared until the present day and Todd Haynes' 'I'm Not There' is another in a long line of explorations on the concept of Dylan, his music and his influence. Telling the story in just over two hours with fragments from boy to old man Haynes uses five actors and one superb actress to play the great man in various guises throughout his multi-layered career Marcus Carl Franklin starts the film as the young Guthrie loving upstart with a head full of dreams and a case full of battered guitar, Christian Bale plays the fledgling protest Bob (and in a later segment the religious pastor) Ben Whishaw plays the French cigarette smoking beatnik poet, Heath Ledger is the seventies rebel, Cate Blancett steals the show as the sixties icon and Richard Gere completes the line up as the ageing outlaw, all in all it's a heady mix and survives because of excellent performances and direction. Of course the film wouldn't be anything with out the music and Bob gave his blessing for them to use it, alongside interpretations of the songs by the likes of Yo La Tengo, Wilco and Calexico to name but a few and the soundtrack rolls through the film like a mist of greatest hits with pieces jumping out from behind the scenes to make you tap your foot. The script is sharp and has some genuine laugh out loud scenes (in particular watch for the Beatles bit) each scene is so different from the surreal village at the end to the black and white sixties trips and the bleached out court room, it all weaves together to create the blanket of the life of one of the biggest names in music history. Whether you need to be a fan to enjoy it as much as I did I'm not sure, it should stand up on its merits alone, but with the awards season on the horizon expect to see the film in various lists and with her method portrayal if Blancett doesn't win a best supporting actress then something is wrong. A brilliant semi-biopic of the man, the legend and the sometimes unfathomable Bob Dylan."
"Quinoa1984","10","8","20","24 November 2007"," strangely insightful, feverish trip into the consciousness of Bob Dylan- public as well as mythic and personal- and great tunes!
","It's not quite as the ads have said - there aren't six people specifically playing Bob Dylan. It's fragments, pieces, all making up a tableau regarding the myth, history, pop-mania, arrogance, self-deprecation, strange humor, and undeniably powerful musical ability of Bob Dylan. It's Todd Haynes working wonderfully without a net on what isn't a film that will be for everyone, much like Dylan himself. It shuffles around the six perspectives- albeit never in a manner that is confusing or too startling in terms of the storytelling relating to each other- and it does depend a lot on how much one knows about their Dylan history (Woody Guthrie, Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid, horrible husband, erratic rock star, folk legend-cum-born again, and the enigma always hiding that wound up more contradictions than a pretzel smothered in ice cream). Godard would approve.<br/><br/>For those that admire Dylan, or at least can understand how hype and fame can merge with the possibility of Dylan as an outsider in the 1960s of all times, and knows at least a little bit (the ""hey, it's Alan Ginsberg!"" gag, as he rides up alongside Dylan's limo, played by David Cross, is one of the funniest things I've seen in years), and can respect how the filmmaker pays respect while ultimately adulating the whole ideal of a iconoclastic figure, the film serves up many moments of ""pure"" enjoyment. Others, who know him as writing Blowin' in the Wind and All Along the Watchtower, and know him as the guy on that album cover with the girl on the New York street, might be a little more perplexed - actually more-so than a little. Haynes's film can be argued on the flip side of the coin as pretentious doodling and meandering with Felliniesque aspirations and grandeur Americana. On the other hand, at least for the former, the same can go for Mr. Dylan. Does he care what he says? Who's to say? <br/><br/>If for nothing else, aside from the brilliant editing and mind-blowing camera-work, edging on the sublime, see it for the songs, of course (including a mixture of classic Dylan material, some of which is not new to my ears, some is, and very well done covers), and for the performances. Cate Blanchett is a marvel, totally deserved of another Oscar nomination, as she digs deep into the most well-known period of Dylan's height of glory (and the tipping-point, as we see, prior to his real-life motorcycle accident), with the bushy hair and the kooky manner of speaking and almost shy demeanor, Blanchett makes it all her own. But lest not forget Christian Bale and Heath Ledger, who may actually fare a lot better here than in the upcoming Dark Knight (who's to say, of course), as Bale especially takes on the persona of the young and reinvigorated Dylan, looking exactly like the 'Times They Are-a-Changing' form, and Ledger as the devilish, mean womanizer side. And the little black kid and Richard Gere are OK too- actually, the black Kid, Carl Franklin, is more than OK.<br/><br/>The point is, I'm Not There is exhilarating for the open-minded, revelatory in spurts, and with that kind of rush that a story, fable, history, and musical mixed together can bring only so often in cinema. And like Dylan, it's post-modern to the point of at one moment scratching your head and another moment wanting to clap your hands like hell. It makes Across the Universe, frankly, look like Child's Play in comparison. The Beatles, I might add, appear in the most blatant (and uproarious) cameo of the year."

","I didn't know anything about the Bob Dylan's life only a few songs that I had heard of him once. But even so, for me it was a film well done, each of these episodes-characters shaped Dylan's personality, all his dreams, concerns, afflictions, obstacles, that converge into one point: the myth, the legend.<br/><br/>This dream's touch that has the story for many is the biggest hit to mix it with each of Dylan's songs, but it is also true that this is the characteristic that makes keeping the viewer, more often, on the sidelines because we are not able to go depth to the outcome of each conversation, phrase or episode submitted by Haynes's direction who knew how to summarize, simplify and splitting a story without beginning or end, as must be the life of any myth.<br/><br/>Technically the film is a visual delight. The frantic editing that combines a story with another through a photography that uses the white and black's mysticism and dark colors's melancholy that make the film easily advance, even its incomprehensible moments, as all human life, but beautiful for being exactly the same thing. The performances achieved are perfect too, especially Blanchett and Ledger that performed someone closer to a Bob Dylan.<br/><br/>At the end of all the movie is a journey through a legend that never met, a character who is on the screen but isn't the original, which is set by all the stories but that doesn't belong to any. This is the story of a man who rather than a man is the lyrics and chords of a song."

","Sure this is not for everyone, and unless you have at least a minor special place in your heart for Mr. Dylan, and are somewhat familiar with his life story, many of the film's brilliant moments may be lost. However, those hoping for the closest thing to a musical tribute to one of the modern age's largest and most enigmatic icons should be singing the praise of Todd Haynes and his insightful, perceptive, and classy way of handling the material.<br/><br/>Conceptually, I'm Not There seems like a bigger gamble then necessary. Using six totally different types of people (black boys, women, etc) to highlight a different period of Bob's life might have seemed pretentious on paper, though it remains evident why some big names attached themselves to the project after reading just that- Haynes produces the uncanny feeling of prodding this man's public soul in a way that is neither stubbornly elusive or obnoxiously obvious.<br/><br/>It's a bit slow to start, and the movie is not without it's weak segments, but framed around Cate Blanchett's rightly praised, scene-stealing turn as the most provocative of the Dylan personalities, Haynes has pieced together one of the most rewarding puzzles of '07."

","So I illegally downloaded Todd Haynes' new film, I'm Not There, the other day. I kinda wish I had seen it in a theatre, cuz there is some amazing music at play here. Nonetheless, I enjoyed the film. The buzz around the film has mostly surrounded the fact that Cate Blanchett plays Bob Dylan, or rather, a version of Bob Dylan. But while her performance is one of the best parts of the film, it is only a portion of the film. But the buzz has been so overwhelming that I didn't realize Christian Bale was in the film until I saw him in the credits.<br/><br/>The point of the film, I guess, is to show the different sides of Bob Dylan through different character that each represent some part of his personality and a different phase of his life in the spotlight. Each segment has its own unique style and take on the artist. Some segments and actors are better than others. Overall, I'd say the film is worth seeing on the strength of the better segments and on the strength of the music, which is amazing. But it could've done with a shorter edit and less pseudo-intellectual psycho-babble.<br/><br/>The earliest incarnation of Dylan is shown through a young black boy who calls himself Woody Guthrie (Marcus Carl Franklin). We see him traveling the south on a box car and interacting with various hobos and families that take him in. I suppose that this represents his life before fame, where he seems to be a fake. He talks about losing his true love and losing his career to the bottle before joining the union cause, despite it being 1959. During this segment, Woody learns to ""sing about his own time"", which leads us into the next segment.<br/><br/>Christian Bale plays Jack Rollins, the introverted political ""finger-pointer"" who takes the folk music world by storm in the early 1960's. This segment is done in an faux 1980's documentary with Julianne Moore giving interviews as Rollins friend and fellow singer/songwriter. While Moore nails the part of grown up hippie, Bale is a little less sure. His scenes feel awkward at first as he hunches over his guitar and imitates Dylan's trademark mumble. He grows into the role and it seems less like acting later on, but I can't help but feel he was miscast. He has too much confidence and presence as an actor, it just doesn't feel right.<br/><br/>The ""documentary"" follows Rollins as he becomes disillusioned with the music business and with politics after JFK's assassination. The last we see of Rollins, he's an ordained pastor who denounces his old music as work of ""the devil"" and puts his songwriting skills to work singing for God.<br/><br/>The next incarnation of Dylan is Robbie Clark (Heath Ledger, RIP), the bad boy movie star who plays Rollins in one of his films. This segment covers his 9-year marriage to Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg), which begins well and ends badly after Clark gets entangled with a co-star on one of his movies. This segment of the film is obliquely entangled to the Vietnam War, the marriage ends when the war ends. While Gainsbourg's performance is wonderful, Ledger's Clark doesn't seem to bear much resemblance to Dylan, who was never a real movie star, and never that charismatic. I suppose this sequence was meant to be seen as the era where Dylan entered the mainstream, where he was ""cool"". But if this is the case, I don't see why so much time is spent on the relationship with Claire.<br/><br/>The Blanchett sequence is the best sequence. Blanchett plays with the sexuality and gender of her character, Jude Quinn. This version of Dylan resembles the post-electric Dylan who angered his fans to the point where they threw things at him on a regular basis. Blanchett's portrayal of Quinn is not sympathetic at all. He is a cynical, drug-addled, mess of a human being, but still a great artist. This segment covers Quinn's interview with Keenan Jones(Bruce Greenwood), a British TV personality who effectively ""kills"" Quinn by inciting the anger of his fans who wanted the traditional folk songs and are angered by his not being the same as he was before.<br/><br/>This segment also covers the psychedelia of the era by having Quinn get so high as to insult all of his friends and puke at a party from too many drugs. In this state, he befriends the nihilistic poet, Allen Ginsberg (David Cross), who suggests that Quinn will never recover from passing out because dying is the ""in"" thing to do.<br/><br/>It's unfortunate that the last sequence is one in which Dylan is imagined as an older Billy the Kid(Richard Gere). One who wasn't actually killed by Pat Garrett, but remains in hiding. This is an obvious reference to Sam Peckinpah's film Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid, in which Dylan co-starred as neither Pat Garrett nor Billy the Kid. There's nothing wrong with Gere's performance, but it bears little resemblance to any of the previous Dylan's and little resemblance to Dylan himself.<br/><br/>Bruce Greenwood returns, but this time as Pat Garrett, who represents the establishment that pisses Billy the Kid off enough to return to work. This whole sequence is too metaphorical, Marcus Carl Franklin even appears as if to complete the ""circle"". It especially feels false coming off the wonderful Cate Blanchett/Jude Quinn sequence.<br/><br/>I still give the film a thumbs up, however. The is music is all Dylan, and as you would expect, it's all wonderful. The strength of the Guthrie/Rollins/Quinn sequences make up for the shortcomings. When you have 6 actors up against each other like this, it's almost unfair. One is obviously going to come across as better than the others. In this case, it's Blanchett. saying that Blanchett is the best actor is unfair, however, as she also has the most showy character and the best dialogue.<br/><br/>bartholomewrichards.blogspot.com"

The events that follow are drawn as much from Dylan's songs as from his actual biography. <br/><br/>My Review: <br/><br/>In short, 'I'm Not There' is restless, brilliant, and so far up its own arse. It's that kind of film: abundantly engulfing with its self-ego centric demeanour, with the subject that's wholeheartedly likable. <br/><br/>It's all about Bobby; it's a personal elegy to him, and all albeit an allegory that tells parts of his life through the use of several actors who prove to be a well ensemble of players. It's not in order, it goes from best to worst parts of his life, and it has to be; fractionally chronological as you are meant to see his life through a mix of good and bad times. <br/><br/>Each segment entwines with the rest, seeming almost unnoticeable. As if you almost wait to see two different Bobby's run past each other, like some corny way to go from one story to another. <br/><br/>The Man Dylan, who is it we suspect is his true self? Cate Blanchett, Heath Ledger, Ben Whishaw, Charlotte Gainsbourg, etc all play a part in Dylan's mayhem lived lifestyle. Heath Ledger playing the easily absolved actor who could have been bigger as apposed to the singer who was made. Heath is also the failed husband, and then there's Ben Whishaw's Dylan who fathoms and tries to connect his life with the poet Rimbaud. <br/><br/>Cate Blanchett's Dylan gives a depiction of his controversial years, where he seemed lost on what his direction of music would turn to. Blanchett is the one who most closely captures the familiar inner conflict and the more upstaged conflict that wasn't in public's eye. <br/><br/>Verdict: <br/><br/>Played by multi-talented actors, we are given a multi-faceted biopic of Bob Dylan in his prime. It may irritate, fine wined for some. Amazing plethora-ed depiction. 8/10."

","I recently watched this film at the International Film Festival in my hometown of Rotterdam. Before screening, the cinematographer of the flick walked in and did a speech. He said he regretted Todd Haynes couldn't be there in person, but he just wanted to tell us to enjoy the movie. His closing comments were that this movie was 'just like a Dylan song, you don't have to understand everything to enjoy it'.<br/><br/>After watching this film, I was amazed at how right those words just were. The movie opened beautifully with 'Stuck Inside of Mobile With The Memphis Blues Again' and immediately, I enjoyed it. After a while, I was impressed by some of the stylistic devices and acting performances, yet I didn't truly feel I fully understood or followed this film. Then, afterwards, I actually felt no different. Despite this, I really enjoyed this film. I simply love Bob Dylan, but seeing as I'm relatively young I always have the feeling there are certain things about him I don't know or understand yet. This goes especially for his sometimes abstract lyrics. Nevertheless, I love his music. Much the same can be said for this movie; it drags you in from beginning to end, and you never lose your attention, but at the same time, you can't always put your finger on what the movie's getting at.<br/><br/>Some of my favourite Dylan songs were in the movie and they were used at the right time, making them a contribution and not a gimmick. Also, the acting was superb; specifically the young Marcus Carl Franklin and Cate Blanchett, whose Dylan was simply the best (my friend didn't know she was in it and didn't realize her Dylan was a woman until I told him after the movie). The only drawback to this piece of art is that it was a bit long; after a while, the many stories start to drag a little.<br/><br/>Other than that, this was an excellent art-house picture; every performance hit the spot and every stylistic device was a contribution. Although you might not understand everything, it doesn't matter because you'll enjoy it anyway. <br/><br/>Just like a Dylan song, actually."

","Just as Julie Taymor's musical Across the Universe attempted (and for the most part succeeded) in existing as an embodiment, a spiritual extension of the Beatles songs it features, I'm Not There exists as a startling and beautiful combination of two artists, two artistic branches. The film serves as a spiritual embodiment of the folksy, traditional sound combined with the new-wave, idealistic, poetic, psychedelic lyrics of Dylan's music. Combining the bizarre with the poetic with the beautiful with the traditional, the film manages to paint a portrait of Dylan beyond a simple depiction of his life and the various events that fill it, although the film does an incredibly well and imaginative job of doing that as well.<br/><br/>In another move channeling the spirit of Bob Dylan, Haynes splits up his subject into six characters, each embodying a different aspect of the singer-songwriter or, in some cases, a different period in Dylan's career. It is a wonderfully imaginative gimmick previously employed by none other than Todd Solondz in his film Palindromes, that works outstandingly well to serve Haynes' purpose.<br/><br/>Uncharacteristic of pure independent film (a movement to which I'm Not There undeniably belongs, having not been produced by a studio specialty division such as Focus Features or Paramount Vantage but rather truly independently produced), Hanyes is blessed with an all-star cast, so much so that some of them seem underused, such as Julianne Moore. Christian Bale delivers a startling restrained performance as a closed, reclusive version of Dylan, expertly done and surprising considering his knack for showmanship in most of his previous roles. Richard Gere delivers a similarly restrained, laid-back performance. Newcomer Marcus Carl Franklin does a surprisingly poignant, life-filled and energetic job as the young blues player with wisdom far beyond his years. But the film's two centerpiece performances are also its most prominently featured. Cate Blanchett does an absolutely, indescribably phenomenal job and delivers what is by far the best performance of the film. The incredible bravery and novelty of a female actress playing a male character in a non-comedic film aside, Blanchett does an uncanny job reminiscent of her Oscar-winning role as Katherine Hepburn, by effortlessly combining imitation with deep, resonant, revealing characterization. Blanchett doesn't miss a quirk, capturing Dylan's look, mannerisms and speech spot-on, while also managing to allow the true inner soul of her character seep out  the emptiness, the loneliness, the hopelessness. Heath Ledger delivers a similarly affecting, masterful performance as a Dylan strident in is values and weighed down by his fame at one end and family life at the other. It is a role that further increases the tragedy of Ledger's recent death, directly continuing his momentous tendency of increasingly complex, challenging and ultimately fulfilling and skillful performances since his amazing turn in Brokeback Mountain. It is so sad for the life of such a promising young actor whose talent was only just starting to bloom to be cut off so suddenly and under such tragic circumstances. His passing was quite a shame.<br/><br/>In the spirit of true independent film, Haynes conducts a fascinating experiment with I'm Not There, creating a pastiche of mixed feelings, emotions and identities. Creating a unique musician biography picture by splitting his subject into 6 separate characters and not mentioning his name once, Haynes goes even further and has his film feature a wondrous combination of art forms, coexisting with Dylan's work and functioning as a truly imaginative amalgamation of music and film. Sometimes it may seem that Haynes' experimenting goes a little too far, and it is easy for me to see how the film would confuse the average moviegoer not familiar with Dylan's life and work. Featuring everything from sped-up psychedelic binges to feral dreams and visions to wild animals literally walking the streets, it is an undeniably bizarre piece of work, with some of its events and twists entirely devoid of a logical explanation whatsoever  although perhaps this is yet another aspect of Dylan integrated into the film. Vividly stylized and beautifully shot, the all-star cast also works to the film's advantage and provides it with yet another layer of interest. And of course, what's a musical bio-pic without the music; accompanied by a wide array of Bob Dylan's songs, from all his different periods and performed by various artists including prominently, and naturally, Dylan himself, the music provides the final element of the film's ultimate goal to embody, personify, and channel the spirit of Bob Dylan. While it may not always work, for the most it is a wonderfully imaginative, strikingly visual, unique and surprisingly epic piece of independent film, sealing Hayne's place as a truly visionary directorial force whose work should be reckoned with."

","Bob Dylan helped show the Western world popular music could be more than just boy-meets-girl tunes and superficial hooks. His songs had, at times, depth and vision. But ""I'm Not There"" doesn't care about any of that. Instead, director Todd Haynes (who, unsurprisingly, has an Arts Degree in Semiotics) reduces Dylan to a series of signifiers and signs. Dylan, of course, has himself frequently been accused of being ""meaningless"", ""opaque"" and reliant on ""nonsensical metaphors"" and ridiculous ""signs"".<br/><br/>""I'm Not There"" thus sets about portraying Dylan as a kaleidoscopic conman. ""Who is Bob Dylan?"" Haynes asks. ""Whatever"" is his postmodern answer. He's not here, he's not there, we can never know.<br/><br/>Whilst some of Haynes' subplots do offer ""interpretation"", and so concede that Dyaln himself might ""mean something"", for the most part the film eschews truth for fashionable obfuscation. Haynes doesn't care about Dylan's music or Dylan the historical figure. Instead, he presents us with the public's ever changing perception of Dylan. He approaches Dylan through a layer of smoke and mirrors, presenting us with masks rather than truth. For those of us who know or care about Dylan, the film is the equivalent of flicking through Dylan's album covers.<br/><br/>Dylan's ""different faces"" evolved out of the public's growing need to peg him down. Here was an artist who constantly jumped from one genre to the next, playing with the plasticity of music as he moved from folk, to country, to rock, to Gospel, to reggae, to pop, to jazz and finally to blues. Each change confounded the pubic. Dylan's abstract prose and poetic metaphors only served to further muddy the waters. Who exactly is Dylan and what exactly was he trying to say? No one seemed to know.<br/><br/>Dylan was also an intensely private man who only presented his art to the world. As the public had no true perception of his private life, they mythicized him. As they had a shifting perception of his music, they created masks for each stage of his career. There was the rock-n-roll face, the wise prophet face, the skinny country hick face...each one presenting itself at roughly 5 year intervals.<br/><br/>But though Dylan's music continually reinvented itself, changing shape and form, even an idiot could tell that artist's ""voice"" (not in the acoustic sense) and personality stayed the same. He was always the same guy. Always trying to distill, for better or for worse, some truth down into song form. One need only listen to his music to see the singular human being behind those plural masks.<br/><br/>But Haynes doesn't understand the essential thing about Dylan and his life: his music. Or maybe he's intimidated by genius, and has no means of finding the visual equivalent of Dylan's tunes. Or perhaps he wisely intends to let the songs speak for themselves.<br/><br/>Regardless, Haynes takes the easy route and creates a film comprising of 9 or 10 disconnected segments. Each segment has Dylan played by a different actor. Each segment adds fuel to all the usual Dylan clichés. In other words, Haynes' film is a fitting tribute to the Dylan many perceive has made no literal sense since 1963, but an insult to Dylan the lyricist and artist. Haynes is content to give us an Andy Warhol style portrait of man who doesn't exist.<br/><br/>The problem is, I think, that ""I'm Not There"" was made by people who were mere children in the 1960s. People who had gained generational consciousness only in the 70s and early 80s. Of course an artist need not belong to the era he's expressing through his art, but those arising out of the 70s and 80s all had postmodern sensibilities. These filmmakers are akin to DJs, inclined toward pastiches of popular culture. A copy of a copy or a quote of a quote. Everything is trashy so let's just revel in junk.<br/><br/>All artists draw from previous achievements, but great artists also reach for the unique, the personal, the sublime, some ineffable truth. We don't get this with hyper post-modernists. As most of popular entertainment is pretty superficial, bubblegum, trendy, and outdated fast, hyper post-modernists basically indulge in cut-and-pasting and so replicate superficial material. What is there to really think about in most popular art? Now Todd Haynes isn't the postmodern monster that Tarantino or the Coens are - judging from his excellent other films, he has a sort of beautifully homosexual, introspective and intellectual side - but here his postmodern sensibilities are entirely at odds with Dylan's more traditional, modernist sensibilities. Haynes cuts and chops, giving us montage and murals, whilst Dylan just wants a simple pen in his hand and a harmonica in his mouth. Dylan's a thinker and feeler who's been chopped up and reduced to a series of freak-show segments, tabloid images and advertisement posters. Depressingly, this is also the film's very point. Haynes is unable to peg Dylan down so instead serves us a giant ""he's not here"".<br/><br/>7.9/10 - See Altman's ""Vincent and Theo"" and Ashby's ""Bound For Glory""."
"JTKellehernow","3","9","25","29 October 2007"," On mythmaking
","it is said that ""I'm Not There"" is the first fictional treatment of the life of Bob Dylan that has been approved by the artist. it is not surprising. It is a long winded exercise in mythmaking - packaging some incredibly imaginative sequences and performances with long sequences of great tedium. This is clearly not intended as a literal treatment of the Dylan life story but as an exploration of the multi-levelled nature of the man, his elusiveness, his own tendency to obscure and cloud and offer variable versions of his own biography. (The first volume of his so-called autobiography did something similar with its absurd razor sharp recollections of events in Greenwich village 40 years ago - descriptions of people's facial expressions, of the light on snow etc. Good writing etc... but unreliable). Well this film plays in the heart of unreliability - and aspires to reflect this genius through versions of his life, cutting back and forward in time, but not really reaching into the present beyond the use of a few relatively recent songs. The latest Dylan we encounter here is the born-again man. The Neverending Tour of the past fifteen years is not alluded to. The most powerful central core of this film is the mid-sixties Dylan, shot in stark black and white, with Cate Blanchett offers a dynamic performance as the electric muse - probably for most Dylan fans the moment of his greatest achievement. The evocation of this era is offered in a crackling and sharply scripted series of passages - though even here a degree of cliché is included (The Philip Jacobson style BBC cultural pundit is a cartoon and the cues to ""Ballad Of A Thin Man"" are so predictable!) There are plenty of cute references to other films, photography, quotations etc - Jonathan Miller's Alice, The Beatles, Dick Lester, Robert Frank etc. which are fun. ) However this is a film that is really rather unlikely to reach out beyond those already intrigued by the whole Dylan phenomenon. As a narrative it is as meandering as his own ""Renaldo And Clara"" venture and at times seems genuinely interminable. The passages featuring the Richard gere version of Dylan are the weakest - evoking the Big Pink/Band/Back to American roots era of Dylan after the ""motorcycle crash"". Some of the lines given to the ""ghosts of Dylan in this film point to that core elusive self that Dylan protects - particularly when the Sixties electric Dylan starts talking about the music being ""traditional"" in a way wholly other than the idea of folk as popularised in the early sixties. I believe few who pay attention would asrgue with the idea of Dylan as a creative genius. I'm not sure this film offers much illumination on the nature of thast genius. Again one can quibble with certain details - the sequence where Pete Seeger is seen going for an axe at the Newport folk festival for instance (read White Bicycles by Joe Boyd to see this as another cloud of myth) but that may not be the point since the film is layer upon layer of myths and half truths and rumours. All in all though a long and not especially profound ride. Listen to the music instead. It could have been an hour longer with no gain or loss. There is sadly a sort of smug hipper than thou quality about the whole exercise."

","Every Dylan fan knows when it comes to film if it ain't a documentary(don't look back, no direction home, the last waltz) then it's time to abandon all hope(pat garrett and billy the kid, renaldo and clara, hearts of fire, masked and anonymous). A great concept of multiple actors playing different stages in Dylans life gave me hope... Unfortunaely its an inaccessible, cryptic, circus of reenactments with a Richard Gere in pat garrettland part tacked on. <br/><br/>For a Dylan fan, the reenactments at times are boring especially when treading into territory Scorsese masterfully handled in No Direction Home. Other times such literal images as a tarantula walking across the screen for when he writes his book ""tarantula"" just seem...well, too literal. <br/><br/>There is a lot of Dylan trivia poured into this. Haynes gives the impression that he's really done his homework but to what effect? Of course the music is the strongest thing keeping this thing going(great Hollis Brown cover in there). <br/><br/>For a non-Dylan fan there's not much story or even character to hang on to. As the film passed 90 minutes a few groups made their way to the exits. <br/><br/>There was a hope that this would play like a film version of ""chronicles"" but it was just a hope.

","I came in to this screening looking to really like this movie, but I ended up just as confused about Bob Dylan than I had been in the past.<br/><br/>Granted, I'm not a familiar fan of Dylan's work, but I understood going into this film that it was going to be about multiple depictions of Bob Dylan's life through different interpretations by the actors. But, not all of them worked. In particular, Richard Gere's story didn't really make a great deal of sense. I understood it, but it didn't tie into the other personalities very well because it just seemed so surreal, so much of that character in his own world that only a Dylan fan would understand all of its significance.<br/><br/>Cate Blanchett was awesome, and obviously depicted the Dylan I've come to learn about a little bit before going into this film. Christian Bale and Heath Ledger were also very good, and added to the story very well. However, with the fragmentation, with the different personalities, I had trouble understanding Dylan as a person. You, the fans, probably know all about his history, his mythology, his lyrics, and understand how this all ties together with him in the movie. However, the key to really enjoying and loving every minute of this film is that you have to be familiar with Dylan and his work to enjoy the film.<br/><br/>Obviously this isn't Walk the Line, or some other linear biopic/biography, but shouldn't I want to learn more about Dylan after watching this? Shouldn't I be more interested in the man to care about his work and what he was trying to say? Maybe that is the point of this film, to show that enigma. However, in order for me to like this film more, I have to do research on Bob Dylan and re-watch it a second time.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the cinematography and the music really drove this film among the separate personalities of the actors. I just thought that I should've taken something from this film. Some idea. Some revelation about Bob Dylan. But I ended up with more questions than satisfaction."
"mjsinclair","7","3","6","11 December 2007"," He who shall not be named
","As I left the cinema, there was a question burning a hole in my mind. Did Bob Dylan really have long, manicured finger nails, and did he really walk Just Like a Woman? <br/><br/>Although I am of the generation who grew up with Bob Dylan, I was always indifferent to him, as I preferred music to songs. I listened to Jazz, Classical, and Rock music; music where words were either absent or merely incidental. You see, for me, Dylan was a wordsmith, and he should have stuck to poetry. For my personal taste, his voice was monotonous, and his music was too simple. I never listened to the words. I therefore managed to grow up in total ignorance of the man, the legend, the myth that is Bob Dylan.<br/><br/>Of course over the years, despite my valiant efforts to resist, the media bombardment has ensured that his songs have seeped into my subconscious forever to remain. I have come to acknowledge him as an important figure in contemporary music, and his songs have become part of our culture, even defining the times in which we live. I still however, remained essentially ignorant of the man himself, his background, his motivations, and the major events of his life; in short, what made him who he is. Billed as a biography, I expected this film to enlighten me. Not so.<br/><br/>The film is not a biography as such, and does not run in chronological order. No, it is more of a multi-dimensional portrait, depicting the many sub-personalities of this enigmatic, misunderstood, protean artist, in a revolving melange of folklore, fiction and fact.<br/><br/>The director paints his subject (whose name is not mentioned once throughout the entire film) as an unknowable, radical egocentric, resisting every attempt to be pigeon-holed. Artistically, he has succeeded in great measure. However, unless you already know a lot about the man, and his life influences, you might, like me, miss a lot of the references, and so find it all a bit confusing.<br/><br/>Cate Blanchett does a fine impersonation of his more publicly recognised persona; so good in fact that I found myself scrutinising her performance for the slightest imperfections. She convincingly captured his mannerisms and voice, but her walk was still a woman's walk - even with a sock pushed down the front of her trousers (apparently)  and too feminine. As for the long, manicured finger nails? Was this an oversight, a deliberate ""faux pas"" by the director, or did the man have a strong effeminate side? I didn't know the answer in advance, and the film failed to provide it.<br/><br/>So, if you are already a Dylan fan, then I suspect that this film will delight you. Even if you are not, but you can admire its originality and its artistic virtues, then you will probably enjoy it too. However, if you prefer your biographies straight and true, then it is probably not for you.<br/><br/>Although this film is unlikely to be a hit at the box office, it will stand as a testament to the film making skill and creativity of Todd Haynes. It made an impression on me, and I for one, will not forget it in a hurry."
"howard.schumann","7","3","6","10 December 2007"," More parody than homage
","Todd Haynes' I'm Not There attempts to convey an artistic impression of singer/songwriter Bob Dylan's multi-faceted personality by using six actors to portray him at different phases of his career. Divided into five segments, the film shows Dylan over a period of twenty years as a hobo folk singer, a spokesman for political and social issues, a rock star, a born-again Christian, and a philandering movie celebrity. With its unconventional style, I'm Not There is a slap at linear Hollywood-style bio-pics. An experimental film that, like Bob's personality, is continually shape shifting, the film's very nature does not allow for character development, sense of time, coherence, or even intriguing content.<br/><br/>The first sequence follows an eleven-year old black boy named Woody (Marcus Carl Franklin) riding the freight trains to New Jersey to visit Woody Guthrie in a Morristown hospital. In other episodes, Ben Whishaw is a poet-philosopher suggesting Arthur Rimbaud, Jack Rollins (Christian Bale) is the early Dylan folkie in Greenwich Village and Robbie Clark (Heath Ledger) is the celebrity who falls in love with Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg). Cate Blanchett portrays Jude, a stand-in for Dylan on his 1965 British tour in which he was booed for turning to an electric sound. Jude fights off voracious media questioning with put downs and sarcasm but the mimicry is flat and Blanchett's mannered performance fails to convey the playful sweetness of Dylan or even his acerbic tongue. Richard Gere, in a dubious episode, is a Dylanesque version of Billy the Kid who lives by himself and avoids confronting his main rival, Pat Garrett.<br/><br/>Each segment includes Dylan's songs, album covers, and well known photos and cameos by Alan Ginsberg (David Cross), Brian Jones and The Beatles in an attempt to capture ""an essential truth"" about the artist, yet Haynes' portrait rarely provides any deeper insights than have already been revealed in Dylan's memoirs and films such as Don't Look Back or No Direction Home. Even with all the posturing, the film only barely touches on the essence of who he is and basically stops thirty years ago. It is more parody than homage, exaggerating the audience overreaction to his electric phase and placing too much emphasis on his folk period as being ""fake"".<br/><br/>Nowhere in the film do we get a glimpse of the excitement that surrounded Dylan's emergence as an artist, or the kind of musical poetry that brought Allen Ginsburg to tears. While the film has some of the great Dylan songs, some sung by Bob and some by stand-ins, there is nothing deeply felt here and Haynes fails to capture the passion and inspiration of his music. Bob Dylan is not a series of archetypes or shifting faces. He is a poet, an artist, a musician, a man who had something important to say and said it in a way that articulated the built-up frustrations of an entire generation. In I'm Not There, in spite of the conceit of the multiple actors, there is only one Dylan - the shadow - masked and anonymous, not the man - vital and creatively alive."

","In true tribute style, I'M NOT THERE opens with the sounds of adoring fans waiting for their favorite folk-rock star to grace the stage. The camera maneuvers in first person point of view through the winding corridors leading from the dressing room to the stage. This build toward the reveal is one we've all seen before but this is perhaps the most traditional thirty seconds of the entire film. It isn't long before the cheers are interrupted by the roar of a motorcycle and a man on a bike driving across a deserted dirt road. The shot is ultra wide and the sky is that deep grey only black and white film can provide. Writer/Director, Todd Haynes inadvertently announces, in the mere seconds it takes the shadowy biker to cross from one end of the screen to the other, that what we are about to watch will be anything but traditional, aesthetically breathtaking and an experience unlike any other. Blinking boldly on and off in the middle of the sky are the words of the title  one by one they appear out of sequence until they settle for a moment in order and all at once, before flickering away yet again. I'M NOT THERE is inspired by the many lives of Bob Dylan but he is somehow nowhere to be found in the two hours that follow and yet still everywhere at the same time.<br/><br/>I'M NOT THERE is entirely and unapologetically experimental. Six different actors (Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett, Marcus Carl Franklin, Richard Gere, Heath Ledger and Ben Wishaw) play six different characters that represent human incarnations of Dylan from various periods of his existence or from inspired interpretations of where his life could have gone. No one story is told from beginning to end nor overtly connected to any of the surrounding stories. Each is told with a different visual motif, from smooth to grain, from subdued black and white to brilliantly expressive color, from cinema verité to abstract imagery that leaves you lost and puzzled. The entire undertaking can be daunting and overwhelming if you aren't prepared. Even if you go in armed with sharpened knives ready to dissect the onslaught of non-linear imagery, it will come at you so fast, your knives will be dulled before you can make the first cut. While it certainly helps to be a fountain of Dylan knowledge, it won't hurt if all you can do is maybe hum along to ""Blowin' in the Wind"" on a good day because Haynes is not concerned with telling a direct account of Dylan's story. Rather, he is paying homage to what his life and how he lived it inspired both passion and rage in millions.<br/><br/>What saves I'M NOT THERE from being overbearing, pompous and pretentious is intention. Haynes had been a Dylan fan in his high school years but only recently rekindled his love for the artist. His decision to cast and shoot without boundaries was meant to embody the same spirit and freedom of the man whose life story he was telling. His unfettered approach does at times come off as film student idealism (with expert technique, mind you) but his innovative and open-minded choices ultimately win out as inspired. His decisions are not only experimental but also successful. There is never a moment that Haynes's love for Dylan is in question. In fact, his love is so potent that, just like the real love experienced in intimate relationships, it clouds his vision. Haynes's Dylan is put upon and criticized to the point of hiding and recluse but his attackers (members of the press or fans who have turned on him) are always portrayed as people disappointed that he is not what they want him to be or need him to be. People needed Dylan to bring them peace but all he could claim was that you couldn't change the world with a song, that all he could sing was what was inside of him. In that regard, he never stopped singing about the truth.<br/><br/>The truth behind I'M NOT THERE is that it is best enjoyed if you don't try to define it. If you allow it to be what it is, to let it go where it must in order to be complete, then its secrets will inevitably reveal themselves when they are meant to be seen and understood. I don't pretend to say I understand the film in its entirety. I have theories about what is being said and how it needs to be said in a certain fashion but I can't claim that any of them are accurate. For me, both Todd Haynes and Bob Dylan are poets and this film is but a love poem from one man to the other."
"jaredmobarak","8","5","13","24 November 2007"," Tangled Up In BlueI'm Not There
","Todd Haynes has used the life and music of singer Bob Dylan in order to composite a tale of his many selves in I'm Not There. I know little about the director, besides the names and accolades thrown towards his previous two theatrical works, and besides liking Dylan's songs, I'm not privy to a huge wealth of information on him. There were some rudimentary tidbits, which I found hidden in my head during the film from my Rock'N'Roll Music History class in college, but I think if I knew more I would not have enjoyed the surrealistic journey close to as much as I did. This is not a masterpiece in the complete sense of the word. As an experiment, however, it is a fascinating look into the life of a man that changed his image so often and never conformed to be the person that his fans wanted him to be. Having six characters play him at different periods of his creative journey shows the inventiveness put on display. There is nothing mainstream about the film, and that is a good thing. If I were to have one complaint, it would be the fact that it almost was not surreal enough. It was the overlapping that intrigued methe versions of his life through a young boy's love of Woody Guthrie and the anonymity of an older man's Billy the Kid. No disrespect to the four other personas, but they were just a tad too much impersonation, not enough creative representation.<br/><br/>Haynes is definitely a gifted filmmaker. The compositions and transitions are remarkable and never static or boring. He keeps the tone consistent and never goes off track with the underlying theme he is conveying. Whereas a film like Across the Universe derailed at times, Haynes harnesses this one by always keeping us off-balance and not knowing what might happen next. The music didn't tell the story; it enhanced it. Showing more the time period of our current Dylan stand-in, the music never took the lead to overshadow the actors on screen. However, there are still some beautiful moments, like the funeral scene during the Billy the Kid thread. Although I liked the fact that the music didn't taken control in order to manipulate the audience, it is still the sequence that does which sticks with me the most.<br/><br/>Our four major representations of Dylan are played by Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett, Ben Whishaw, and Heath Ledger. All do an amazing job, but their portrayals just seem too obvious. Maybe it was the technique used to show us their storiesI just wasn't as interested in them as the final two variations. Whishaw is my favorite impression, a talking head narrating, as though in an interview, enhancing the other segments with background information. Bale's section is the least successful, showing us his life as a Behind the Music segment, mostly from the mouth of Julianne Moore. It is too cold and calculated, with little to say except to give us the person for whom Ledger's Robbie acts as in a film, leading him to meet his wife played by Charlotte Gainsbourg. His section is nice, showing us the transformation that fame and wealth and social relevance wrought on his soul. Gainsbourg shines and really it is her reactions to Ledger that resonate. As for Blanchett, her piece is the iconic Dylanthe badass who went electric and left all his fans behind him. She is great as the worked up, most likely drugged up, Jude Quinn telling the world that his music only needs to be relevant to him. He will not be a puppet for the world; if you hate his stuff, don't listen to it.<br/><br/>What got me drawn in were the more expressionistic moments. Marcus Carl Franklin is quite a find here as a young drifter, wandering the world with his music. Innocent and pure, copycatting his idol Guthrie, he is at the cusp of Dylan's first major transformation. With the death of the legend, he finally sees that it is time to become his own person and break through the barriers he has set up for himself. It was time to start singing about today's problems and help create change in society. He is also one of three instances to cross over into another version's story. Besides Ledger and Bale's roles existing simultaneously and Bruce Greenwood's oppressor manifesting in two separate stories, Franklin is seen entering Richard Gere's Dylan world, the other remarkable metaphor for the singer's life. As the real Billy the Kid, in hiding from the world and the authorities to live out his life in obscurity, he is brought back out to strike a change. One can't buckle to the pressures of outsiders and critics, but instead push through and continue to be innovative.<br/><br/>These crossovers are great cinematic moments, helping bridge the gap between all six plot threads. Haynes made a bold move to tell the tale with fragmented personas overlapping and progressing. It is an idea that breeds surrealism and an ignoring of principles found in reality. I also loved his humor, bringing in the Beatles, Brian Jones, and a total mind-trip cameo by David Cross as Allen Ginsberg. I just wish Haynes would've gone full-bore into this parallel universe and not felt the need to every once in awhile bring us back to a realistic linear progression. The Bale/Ledger/Blanchett sequences do ground the story to be more comprehensible, but I almost would have rather been completely unaware of what I had just seen then leaving with the sense of understanding that I did. I caught a few references spiced in of song lyrics, and it's that stuff that I wanted more of. I hope Haynes continues to go in directions that are against the norm because when he does, he creates some marvelous scenes. He is on the right track, giving us a psychological insight into the timeline of one of America's greatest enigmas."

","Well, words really can't describe the feeling of this movie. In fact, it wasn't my FAVORITE movie. But, it was one of those movies that just pulls at you.<br/><br/>After the movie was over, I was discussing the movie with my friend, (also a big Dylan fan) and found myself stuttering EVERY time I was trying to speak. I was halfway thinking about the movie, and halfway talking about Dylan's life. And also, trying to have a conversation.<br/><br/>The movie does a great job of showing the different elements in Dylan's life. The movie is jam packed with references to his songs and his book ""Tarantula"" I thought the movie also did a GREAT job of showing his rise and fall through fame. I LOVED Cate Blanchett, and I'm 100% sure that she'll be nominated for an Oscar, for her performance.<br/><br/>Heath Ledger was great too! He had the second biggest part in the film. Bale, had a rather small part, but an interesting part at that. Gere played a very boring part of the story, in my opinion. I was very uninterested in his part, as a lot of other people were. The young boy was great. He did a good job of playing the ""phony"" Bob Dylan. The one that went around claiming to be from all these different places, and friends with all these different people. Ben Windshaw was my third favorite of all the Bob Dylans. He literally ONLY had like a paragraph of lines throughout the entire film. However, they spaced them out through the whole movie.<br/><br/>The scenes were great too. I just plain out felt like I was watching Bob Dylan's life. Even though the film had it's own metaphors and references.<br/><br/>The film work was great too. The way they did it, was it was sort of a documentary, but also an actual movie. So, they would have scenes with other actors such as Julliane Moore, who would be getting interviewed, and playing a person in Dylan's life. The scenes were also a big part of the film, ESPECIALLY Blanchet's scenes. Her Black & White 60's scenes, blew my mind! And she played a GREAT ""Bob Dylan under stress, turned drug addict"" part! One scene in particular, was mind blowing in my opinion. <br/><br/>SPOILERS BELOW!!!!<br/><br/>They were at a party, and in this room that was shaped like a cube, and the walls were projecting video. Anyway, as Dylan (Blanchett) who was REALLY messed up at the time, went further and further in the rambling and the craziness, the screen showed images that reflected her tone. As he got worse, the images would get faster and/or stranger. At one point Dylan is yelling at his friend. And on the walls, we see video of Dylan freaking out, and spinning around. Then flipping off the cameraman, and dancing. The music supported the tone of the scene, as well. <br/><br/>The movie was filled with things like that example. AWESOME!!! Great movie!"

","I felt about ""I'm Not There,"" Todd Haynes' tribute to the spirit of Bob Dylan, much about the way I feel about Bob Dylan himself. I like the IDEA of Dylan more than I enjoy sitting down and actually listening to him, and that's how this movie was for me.<br/><br/>""I'm Not There"" is not a biography of Bob Dylan, and for that I'm grateful. The last thing the world needs is another film like ""Ray"" or ""Walk the Line,"" bland paint-by-numbers biopics. Rather, Haynes' film is more of a tribute to the many feelings Dylan songs can inspire, and the various personas Dylan the artist took on in the eyes of the public. Therefore, we get six actors playing different Dylanesque characters, or the kind of people Dylan might have written songs about, or characters meant simply to represent a distinct time and place in America. The first we meet is a young black boy named Woody Guthrie and played by Marcus Carl Franklin, who rides the rails with guitar in tow and sings songs that sound like they should be coming from someone much older. Ben Whishaw plays a poet named Arthur Rimbaud who appears to be testifying or defending himself in court for reasons we never learn. Christian Bale is Jack Rollins, an icon of the folk music craze who becomes a born-again Christian in later life; Heath Ledger is an actor who made a name for himself playing Rollins on screen and whose personal life is slowly disintegrating. Richard Gere is Billy the Kid, hiding out in the old West. And in the film's most memorable performance, Cate Blanchett plays Jude, the character most modeled on Dylan himself, who struggles with success and fame in the face of a public growing increasingly frustrated with him for not playing the part they expect.<br/><br/>""I'm Not There"" is full of ideas about art and artists, and I applaud Haynes for attempting to bring something fresh and original to the screen. But I never once connected with the film on any level. The movie never stops experimenting, so it doesn't give you much to get involved with. Everything is representative and symbolic, so none of the characters feel like living breathing people. It's far too long -- I especially felt my patience beginning to snap by the time Gere made his appearance late in the film. The movie feels like it's comprised of a hundred different strands of thought that never cohere. In some ways, this is fitting, since the film is in large part about the enigmatic nature of artists, and the general public's indifference to who an artist really is in the face of who it wants him to be. But even a film about an enigma needs something to anchor it.<br/><br/>Grade: B"
"annoman","7","4","10","25 November 2007"," Abstract, poetic, not entirely enjoyable...yet recommended
","Given its title in reference to an outtake off of one of Dylan's studio recordings (which can be found on the film's two-disc soundtrack), Todd Haynes' ethereal bio-depiction of the folk music legend plays out like a moving Picasso abstract, displaying several stages of Bob Dylan's long-lived day through several alter egos. I'm Not There is an insightfulyet extremely obscurelook into the life and times of the man it attempts to uncover and showcases a handful of actors that are as luminous as their characters.<br/><br/>Marcus Carl Franklin plays an 11-year-old vagabond and blues-belting prodigy named Woody Guthriea name he informally borrowed from the post-depression era folk musician. The young boy's intellect is far beyond what anyone would expect of someone his age, though his age seems to be a blanketing pretense behind which Haynes conceals the hopeful and naïve stage of Dylan's journey to stardom. Retrospectively, Jack Rollins (played magnificently by Christian Bale) is a once-enthusiastic folksinger and protester whose confident outlook took a grim turn to cynicism. In Heath Ledger's portrayal, his character, an actor named Robbie Clark, falls victim to his Hollywood-esquire lifestyle, which chips away at his marriage and provokes a scornful, agitated side of his (similar to that of Jack Rollins', who he actually plays in one of his films) that pushes away everyone closest to him. Richard Gere is a secluded ex-thief named William who signifies Dylan's fixation on mythic Western tales, and Cate Blanchettwho emerges as the film's focal studyis a restless, troubled reflection of Dylan's mid-to-late-60s celebrity. As these characters' stories unravel in a not-so-comprehendible way, the story as a wholethe big picture, if you willis narrated by the voice of Kris Kristofferson, with snippets of Ben Whishaw's 19-year-old poet, an incarnation of Arthur Rimbaud, cut in.<br/><br/>Give credit to Mr. Haynes, he's transformed the heretical style of Dylan's ever-evolving lyricism into a poetical cinematic experience as unconventional as I've ever seen. I'm Not There is considerably admirablethough perhaps too conceptual to be considered an overwhelmingly enjoyable timeand, in addition to its artsy, detailed go-about-things, bursts charismatic tunes of Dylan's hailed career and Dylan-inspired songs from some of today's most stimulated artists (including Eddie Vedder, Jack Johnson, Iron & Wine and Calexico) that stress a case to further its likability. If you areor ever have beena fan of Bob Dylan, his music, his story, or any of the superstar actors that play him, I'm Not There is worth your time and money, and may just turn out a well-made choice at the movies."

","Cinema lives! I'm Not There is one of the most exuberant and ecstatically-made movies I've ever seen. Todd Haynes completely explodes the conventional biopic format by splitting Dylan into six separate characters and crosscutting between them until he achieves something that ends up feeling like a sublime and perfect symphony. <br/><br/>All of the actors do good work in nailing down some aspect of Dylan's personality but Blanchett and Ledger are standouts. The scenes between Ledger and Charlotte Gainsbourg as the Suze Rotolo/Sara Dylan composite are emotionally raw and occasionally painful to watch. Blanchett's final scene in the back of a limo, in which she extols the power of ""traditional"" music in a direct camera address, is deeply moving and reveals the generous heart of the film.<br/><br/>Technically, the film is amazing with cinematographer Ed Lachman and editor Jay Rabinowitz deserving special kudos. I've heard other movies described as ""kaleidoscopic"" but watching I'm Not There was the first time I've truly felt like I knew what that meant. Because each segment is shot in such a radically different style (with different color and lighting schemes), it literally feels like looking through a kaleidoscope. <br/><br/>The Richard Gere section, much derided in some circles, contains some of the most haunting, evocative and poetic moments of the whole film and I'm very grateful for it.<br/><br/>I'm Not There is a film that expands the notion of what movies can be and I will be seeing it several more times in the near future."
"redgator","10","4","10","23 November 2007"," solves the biopic problem
","What a treat! Todd Haynes has solved the annoying biopic problem of depicting coincidences and fakery in telling someone's story. Haynes' biopic is like a visual poem for one of our most beloved and prolific American Poets. Niceties are dispatched with. And the whole thing flows like a mind-bending Dylan track. I need to commend every actor/actress for staying true to ""their Dylan's"" spirit. The writing is wonderful and often hilarious. Blanchett is transcendent in her role as Dylan. Ledger takes the 70's/80's Dylan and gives us insights that relate so wonderfully to his earlier incarnations. Gere takes us into the present and plays around with the aging poet with humor and dignity. I can't recommend this enough for Dylan fans and non-Dylan fans alike. A beautifully wrought castle of elements. Haynes strikes again with one of his most coherent and endearing pictures to date."

","After so many hard and fast musical biopics that seem like they all have the SAME story, I enjoyed watching a different kind of ""biopic,"" one that doesn't provide the comfort or answers of a stale story arc, but rather polishes the Question of a mythical identity. We don't know who Bob Dylan is, but we know that we don't know who he is. Also unlike other musical biopics, the soundtrack to this film is actually a living, breathing part of the film. Hearing the diverse greats of our time like Willy Nelson and Sonic Youth reinvent the music of an icon lends new power to an extraordinary body of work. Interpretations of the songs range from mimicry to unique reinvention. The soundtrack fortifies the film, and stands on its own."

","I'M NOT THERE is by far the most important, exhilarating, profound, and exciting film of the year, if not the decade. A biopic that captures the essence of an equally important, exhilarating and profound man by showing the different personas throughout his life through seven different fictionalized characters. Todd Haynes has crafted the quintessential biopic, a vision of a musician, a storyteller, and a prophet, applauded and ousted throughout his lifetime by the public.<br/><br/>If there was ever any question of Haynes being a true auteur, he has solidified his title as an auteur and also as one of the most talented American filmmakers today. I'M NOT THERE isn't the type of film that will appeal to the mass audience. It's an artistic vision, and will find the most interest with the indie crowd and Bob Dylan fans.<br/><br/>None of the fictional characters have the name Bob Dylan; ""Bob Dylan"" isn't mentioned once in the film. The film is basically seven different short films intertwined, each one representing a different phase of Dylan's life.<br/><br/>Richard Gere plays Billy the Kid, showing an older Bob Dylan, the Dylan of today. This segment is set against the backdrop of the American West. The papers report that Pat Garrett shot and killed Billy the Kid. However he's still alive. The myth, and the press and public's perception, is wrong. This is used as a metaphor for Dylan's entire life.<br/><br/>In the Cate Blanchett sequence, we continually see the theme of how the public has certain perceptions of Dylan. A reporter continually shows up questioning these perceptions, and drilling Dylan on whether he still cares, if his changing music is still addressing the issues ""it used to."" This is a sad notion of Dylan's life.<br/><br/>The title has a lot to say about the man. After awhile, anyone in the public eye is no longer there; they're only the perception of what people have of them.<br/><br/>This is a true masterpiece, and a big credit goes to Co-writer/Director Todd Haynes, and his longtime producer Christine Vachon, who continually produces noteworthy films."
"ferguson-6","8","4","11","25 November 2007"," Just Like a Woman
","Greetings again from the darkness. Director Todd Haynes won me over with his indie hit ""Far From Heaven"". Here he blows me away with his avant-garde Dylan inspired web of song and real-life influenced vignettes held together by six different aspects of the legend, who, as per the title, is not actually present.<br/><br/>The six spirits of Dylan are played by Ben Whishaw (Arthur Rimbaud influence), Christian Bale (as he converts to Christianity), Marcus Carl Franklin (as a young bluesman using the name of the legendary Woody Guthrie) Richard Gere (as western recluse modeled on the legend of Billy the Kid), Heath Ledger (as an actor from the mod 60's era), and the most stunning performance of all, Cate Blanchett, in an all-out spot-on impersonation of Mr. Dylan.<br/><br/>The stories are not told chronologically, instead Mr. Haynes opts to mix 'em up and toss them at us as if they were pieces of a puzzle to assemble, or better yet, the lyrics to a Dylan song! Additionally, we get clips of real life, in fact much of the Christian Bale segment is done documentary style. We gets bits of MLK, JFK, LBJ and the Black Panthers with Hewey Newton and Bobby Seale. That's in addition to the Beatles, Allen Ginsburg and Coco, a nod to Edie Sedgewick (played well by Michelle Williams).<br/><br/>In the Heath Ledger story, we are presented with his wife Claire, who apparently is a mixture of Dylan women and lyrics, complete with painful relationship goodies. Claire is played perfectly by Charlotte Gainsbourg as she shows us how even those closest to him, never really know him. Bruce Greenwood has a couple of roles as a very persistent British interviewer and as old man Garrett (as in Pat) in the Gere story. One of the coolest parts is seeing the great Richie Havens pick his guitar on the porch in the Woody Guthrie story.<br/><br/>This is just an amazing blend of eras and personalities and super-creativity from all involved. I was mesmerized and engaged as I tried to pick out real quotes, real clothes, real moments and those that were based on lyrics and myths (Pete Seeger axing the cable in Newport).<br/><br/>I worry that this won't find the audience it deserves. One need not be a Dylan freak to ""get"" this film. You just have to love multi-layered story telling and some of the most influential music of the modern era. This is wonderful movie making and pure joy to behold."

"bob the moo","Null","2","4","1 March 2009"," The creative construct and delivery make it both flawed and fascinating but is still a great total film despite this
","A biopic of Bob Dylan seemed like it would be of interest because, as much as I did like No Direction Home, I did think it needed more meat on the bones for those not already informed. Long before I saw I'm Not There I knew it was not going to be played that way but the multiple actors and fact it was a Todd Haynes film made me curious to see how it would be done. Answering my own question by watching the film, I was pleased to find that it was done in a wonderfully creative and fascinating way that works so well as a creative project that it is hard to imagine how it could have been done any other way.<br/><br/>Rather than make a straight biopic, Haynes and Moverman have taken events and themes from Dylan's life and created characters that echo this and delivered a patchwork of stories that play like different characters, the idea being that Dylan has had so many stages and faces in his life that this is the best way to do it. What this does is produce a film that is rich with creative ideas and is delivered by the same people who had them  hence feeding them on the screen and making it engaging. In the construct it is almost impossible to criticise because it is so clever and fascinating in its creativity. Likewise the delivery is great, with different styles employed across the threads all producing an experience that I found to be really effective.<br/><br/>Sadly, as with most of my reviews, there is a ""but"" on its way. As with Safe, the delivery from Haynes makes the film but it has a knock-on effect on the story being told. In this case the downside is in the actual biopic element of the film and I would suggest that the film will only work in this regard for those Dylan fans coming to it with knowledge of his life and career. For me I know the bigger picture sweep of his career and know many of the key moments but far from everything. As a result some of the threads were lost on me and some of them didn't work as well as others. A bit of a problem if you are looking for the film to engage in the content as well as be an experience  which, at over two hours, I was.<br/><br/>As with the threads I didn't think all the actors did as well as each other. Blanchett does the best but in fairness is helped by having the most accessible thread for those coming to Dylan off the back of general popular culture. Her Dylan character is convincing and she plays it very well. Franklin was also engaging as his performance (acting and singing) was interesting. I though Ledger, Bale and Gere were not as good and I was a little disappointed considering how good at least two of these can be. In fairness though I was less engaged by their threads in the film and perhaps this reflected on their performance from my point of view.<br/><br/>I'm Not There is a really great film though and it deserves to be seen for the reasons that it is great but you should not go into it unprepared for some aspects of it not being great. The concept, construct and delivery is fascinatingly creative but this approach affects the telling of the story and there are parts of the film that simply don't work and don't engage. However, if you come to it right, the film is more than good enough to cover for this seemingly important flaw and, as a creative project and experience, it is hard to fault and deserves to be seen."
"notjojoleheros","9","2","4","10 October 2008"," Great filmtrack...
","...To the soundtrack: a musical film, a filmic music, anything but a music video.<br/><br/>Now, I knew next to nothing about Bob Dylan. I'd seen Todd Haines' films. Which is why I took a look. And this is more than a look: it's a vision. It immerses you into troubled waters. You cannot seem to find your way in or out but you're nonetheless ""there."" It's weird, so much so I couldn't handle all the stories un-neatly packaged into one big yarn. I was aghast most of the time but the playfulness is contagious. With all the contiguous angles splitting up into one another: you can't help but pick up the roles and go with it. ""I'm Not There"" is quite something, especially if you like film or music or any kind of art that takes you outside your boxes or cubicles. Because, after all: if Bob Dylan could be someone else and yet another person, perhaps you could too. Or perhaps that remains the domain of the artist. <br/><br/>Anyway, I pretty much think Ben Wishaw might just become one of the greatest in his field. Ledger is, sadly, his usual, towering, no-hold-barred self, nicely accompanied by Gainsbourg, who's definitely becoming a great actress after this, ""Science of Sleep"" and ""21 grams."" But yes, even though I like her but find her overrated as such, Cate Blanchett truly steals the whole show. To say ""mesmerising"" would be an understatement and I'm generally critical of these acting-of-living-dangerously stunts. Cate Blanchett IS Bob Dylan, and that alone is a reason to check this out. Once you've seen it, you can't get away from it, whether your like or hate it. But like most memorable movies, it's a lovely prison. As prisons go, it's even pretty loose."
"Ascola","7","2","4","25 September 2008"," Dylan in disguise
","Dreamy film about ingenious Bob. It's not quite true he doesn't appear at all in this movie. Short before the credits we see him blow the harmonica with serious dedication. And roundabout half of the soundtrack consists of original material, making us listen to his highness while we watch his embodiments envisioning and shaping the well known stages of his life to us.<br/><br/>And aren't they beautiful again, these originals, how they accompany himself, the hidden original accompanying himself in copied disguise? how they glimmer, sparkle and shine, these songs, even more so when alternating with the actor's honorable attempts to cover some of them and present them to us. Did anyone ever maintain Dylans songwriting was one thing, his singing and voice the other? how little those have understood.<br/><br/>The film: especially Blanchett and Bale do a hell of a good job to convey Dylans way of speaking and acting even though both of them don't dispose of the same regional language by nature. Blanchett even surpasses Bale in this attempt, also with respect to her acting, and the reason seems to be that their is a natural likeness between her and Dylan which the male actors - funny enough - don't possess to that extent.<br/><br/>We don't understand everything of how all the parts of this films puzzle seem to belong together but that doesn't hinder much. Scorseses ""No direction home"" has told me a lot about Dylans caution not ever to be caught especially by the press or his audience in trying to track him down as being the such and such songwriter or supporting the so and so politics, beliefs and so far. It is this side in him which is depicted and worked along with most in the film - see also its title - and which might well be the source for his creativeness too."
"missmissa","9","2","4","2 August 2008"," Great film...weird, but great
","You can't go into this film expecting to see something that even remotely resembles a commercial biopic. It's not. There are six stories going on here that have hardly anything to do with one another, if they intersect at all. But all stories do have a plot and they all arrive at some sort of conclusion. So, if you go into the film with the right attitude, you won't be dissatisfied at the end. <br/><br/>To help the audience sort through all these divergent stories, Haynes provides visual clues. Whishaw and Blanchett's stories are told in black and white, but Whishaw's story is told almost entirely in a one-shot of the actor, while Blanchett's is something of a roller coaster of a psychedelic ride. There is one particularly funny scene with Blanchett's Jude Quinn and the Beatles that just made me laugh out loud.<br/><br/>Christian Bale's Jack Rollins' story is told entirely as a 60 Minutes-esquire news story following the character through 'stock' footage from the sixties and 'interviews' from the eighties. I'll take this moment to say that Bale and Blanchett do an amazing job of lip-syncing. As a Christian (the faith, not the person), I appreciated the fact that they didn't cheapen or make fun of Dylan's conversion. I do, however, have to say that the eighties-style perm they put on Christian Bale's head was pretty hysterical.<br/><br/>The only time any of the stories intersect is when Heath Ledger's character, actor Robbie Clark, plays Christian Bale's Jack Rollins in a movie. The Ledger story is the most traditional film through line, and one of the more relatable stories. It's about a man whose rise to fame has destroyed his marriage.<br/><br/>The other two stories, revolving around versions of Dylan portrayed by Richard Gere and young Marcus Carl Franklin, are the most surreal and odd. They are also the ones based on the parts of Dylan's life that we know very little about. Go figure. Who knows, they might be the ones that come closest to the truth.<br/><br/>Bottom line, expect to spend a lot of time with one eyebrow up while watching this film. But you will also laugh and be genuinely moved and entertained. It's a great film...weird, but great."
"tsf-1962","10","2","4","26 July 2008"," this movie is habit-forming
","I do not know if ""I'm Not There"" is as fun for other people as it is for Dylan fans, but if you're really into Dylan it's addictive. I rented the film from Blockbuster and watched it 4 and a half times before my eyes gave out. The movie is all the more amazing considering it had Dylan's full cooperation despite its rather unflattering thesis: that Bob Dylan's constantly changing personas are the mark of a pretentious poseur who never really believed in anything. A more charitable view is that Dylan's many masks are a defense mechanism adopted to protect him from the incredible pressures he has faced throughout his career. So many rock stars have been destroyed precisely because they were unable to distinguish their real selves from their stage persona--Jimi Hendrix, Jim Morrison, Janis Joplin, Kurt Cobain, Bryan Jones, to name only a few--just as Dylan himself came close to not making it with his 1966 motorcycle accident. If there is a real Bob Dylan in the film it might well be Richard Gere's Billy the Kid--the one trait Dylan has never wavered in is his obsession with the Old West and Americana--this is probably as close a glimpse as we will ever get to Dylan's psyche. Although attention has understandably focused on Cate Blanchett's Jude Quinn, all six Dylan dopplegangers are brilliant, especially young Marcus Carl Franklin as Woody Guthrie and Arthur Whishaw as Arthur Rimbaud. Heath Ledger's Robbie Clark is a reminder why we will miss this brilliant actor, and ""Dark Knight"" co-star's Father John (the born again Dylan) bears an uncanny resemblance to the Reverend Jim Jones. Of the supporting cast Bruce Greenwood and Charlotte Gainsborough are outstanding, while Michelle Williams steals the show with her devastatingly sensual portrayal of an Edie Sedgewick-based character. An amazing film you have to see to believe. But please see it."
"Michael_Elliott","Null","2","4","28 February 2008"," Great but Fair
","I'm Not There (2007) <br/><br/>** 1/2 (out of 4) <br/><br/>Bob Dylan is without a doubt my favorite musician so I should probably mention this first. I've read countless books, have all the albums and at one time I owned every live concert that he had done (and was available) from 1961-2004. I've watched every documentary and I've even seen him live seventeen times over the past eight years and plan on seeing him more this upcoming year. With that said, I was highly looking forward to this film but at the same time I was a little worried at what they were going to do with it. As with Dylan the man, the legend and his music, this film is 100% weird and I'm not saying that in a good way. Bunuel, Fellini and countless other foreign directors who work on the words surreal and weird would probably also be confused by this film.<br/><br/>The film tells seven different stories in Dylan's life and all seven periods are played by a different actor. You have the pre-fame farm boy (Marcus Carl Franklin), the folk singer (Christian Bale), the man who settles down with a family (Heath Ledger), the 'jerk' who dared to go from folk to rock (Cate Blanchett), an actor playing Billy the Kid (Richard Gere), the sunglass wearing guy being interviewed (Ben Whishaw) and the born again Christian (Bale again). These various stages of Dylan take over the film, which is full of songs from throughout the legends career and we get to see various historical events from the Newport Folk Festival to his ""Judas"" concert to his eventual divorce and his motorcycle wreck. We also see him turning The Beatles onto grass, hanging with Joan Baez and just about everything else.<br/><br/>I'm really not sure where to stand because I really appreciate the balls writer/director Todd Haynes brings to the film. We've seen countless bio pics of musicians since the early days of cinema but there's certainly never been anything like this. The entire film plays out like an acid trip and it never really makes a bit of sense unless you know your Dylan history from start to finish. I appreciate all the various technical things done with the film from the director trying to make the 60's footage look like Don't Look Back and capture the drug state mind of Dylan. I also appreciate all the performances, although they quite often come off as weird but this is to be expected since Dylan is a pretty weird guy anyways. Blanchett is getting a lot of praise, which is certainly deserved but I think Ledger gives the best performance of the bunch. The stuff dealing with Dylan and his wife Sara (here called Claire ala Dylan's Renaldo and Clara) is clearly the best story being told. It's not shocking that this story is the one that doesn't go all out on the weirdness but instead tells a pretty good love story. The music, needless to say, is great and features some of Dylan's biggest hits as well as some lesser known titles. There are a couple covers used, which were perfect for the film and greatly captures the mood that their set.<br/><br/>Even with all that said, I'd be lying if I said this movie entertained me. I'm really going to need at least one other viewing to make my mind up but the film was really frustrating and for the life of me I'm not sure who is going to eat this film up. Unless you know your Dylan history from start to finish then I'm sure you're going to get lost or not see everything that's going on. I know all about the history of events being played here so I followed the movie very easily but at other times things were thrown in that I really had to think hard about what it was. Richard Gere gives a very good performance but I think this segment is the weakest. This takes place during Dylan's retirement of 1967-1973 and it really pushes things too far. The point of the protest singer hiding and not fighting anymore is fine but the way the film is told just doesn't work. Another thing that doesn't work is in fact the entire film, which is very uneven to say the least. Everything on the screen is great but at the same time it really doesn't add up and hold itself together. I'm sure some people might walk into this expecting to finally get a chance to understand Dylan but they'll leave disappointed.<br/><br/>Haynes uses some big moments in Dylan's life but he also throws in some very small stuff from dialogue from unpopular songs to even borrowing some shots from lesser known Dylan movies. The way he introduces the legend of Dylan turning The Beatles onto weed is rather funny as is the scene where Dylan pukes, which is borrowed from Eat the Document. As much as I admire this film I can't help but really be turned off by it as well. Perhaps I was too busy catching all the small nods, which most people will miss and this took away from me enjoying the film more. I'm not sure but that's why another viewing is needed. However, I just can't imagine someone with little knowledge of the man walking out of this understanding what the hell is going on. On a technical side, the film is brilliant but in the end it just doesn't add up."

","For forty years Bob Dylan has refused to allow any dramatic documentation of his life. As with his career as a singer, writer and artist, he did not want to be pigeonholed. But with director Todd Haynes he seems to have met the perfect match.<br/><br/>Rejecting the conventional style of biography, Haynes discards chronology in favour of an abstract and experimental work of art. His decision to cast seven actors to portray the various aspects and influences of Dylan's life is ingenious. Throughout the film, a dream-like atmosphere is maintained, sending the audience on a roller-coaster ride that whilst confusing feels authentic and invigorating.<br/><br/>The most remarkable performance is by Cate Blanchet, who plays the unpredictable and tormented Dylan during his 60s tour of England. The puzzle of Dylan's life is never solved and it's this illusiveness that that makes this production unforgettable.<br/><br/>It comes as a given that the soundtrack is noteworthy. However, it's the use of Dylan's seldom known tracks instead of well established hits that complements this daring 135 minutes. The title itself is that of an unreleased song.<br/><br/>I don't want to, but if I had to find a fault it would be Richard Gere's performance as Billy the Kid. It felt strained and didn't gel quite as flawlessly as the rest. Then again, it may be yet another ingredient in this creative conundrum.<br/><br/>Weird doesn't begin to cover it, but wonderful does. While it may not be to everyone's tastes, I personally think everybody can benefit from seeing I'm Not There.<br/><br/>The Fan Carpet - www.thefancarpet.com"

","I think Cates performance was the best I've ever seen. Its acting at its finest. If you've ever seen any real footage of Dylan than you should. You can compare the two and Cate is right on the money. The way she portrays Dylan is great she looks like him, talks like him, and the mannerisms are almost exactly alike. This may sound corny to some of you but I'm a big fan of her work and by far this has to be the best performance by Cate I've EVER seen. She is very talented and I think she deserves that Oscar. Oh and after the movie try to find some footage of Dylan and the first time you see it your mouth will drop. SHE IS DYLAN.(1965-1966) P.S. My advice: Go buy it just to see her. Its like a gift from the acting gods. (Not kidding)you will watch it and say ""oh my god."" I know I did."

","Todd Haynes is becoming the master of wasted opportunities. While this film is a pleasure when it comes to visuals, sounds and acting, and while the basic concept of interpretive biography is brilliant, this movie is as incoherent as Dylan's garbled speech. All these good ingredients are being put in a blender with A.D.D, and a phone-book worth of characters thrown it to boot. This plethora of small direction-less scenes will make sense to the very few, so this is ultimately a vanity project. (A note to those thinking THEY are to blame for not getting it -- you are not at fault here).<br/><br/>Dylan, the original, is one of the more fascinating figures of the 20th century. His ascent to be the ""God"" of folk music is unique, and his conversion to electric, seen by fans as betrayal, has proved to be a prophecy. Yet this film spends little time on his buildup, no time on his redemption, and his ""betrayal"" is portrayed without the context so it just falls flat. In fact, the most consistent massage of the artist here is refusal to be anything: ""I am not X"", ""this does not mean anything"". Hey Todd - any 5-year old knows how to say no to everything. Give us SOMETHING to chew on. <br/><br/>Just like Mr. Haynes' previous and similar misfire, Velvet Goldmine, this film is less than the sum of its ingredients. Artists that have excited millions of fans are reduced to paper-thin stylistic figures. One wonders if the director cannot understand their qualities beyond their aesthetics and has thus vowed to spoil it for anyone who might."
"ondrejsvec","9","2","4","20 January 2008"," ""Je est un autre""
","Both the ambition and the approach of this movie are appealing. ""Inspired by many lives of Bob Dylan"", it's joyfully mocking the concept itself of ""true biography"". But in fact, such disrespect for the true story turns out to be the most respectful approach that Dylan's well-known talent for self-invention deserves. In a significant sequence, one of the six characters inspired by Dylan lets call himself Arthur and while investigated by a commission wanting to reveal his true motivations and presumably subversive intentions, he quotes from the French poet famous phrase : ""Je est un autre"". By analogy, there is nothing like Bob Dylan's true ME. While watching ""I'm not there"", the only thing we ""learn"" is not to search for a true core of the man as if it was something hidden under his concrete acts, words and attitudes. That's because such an approach would share the same violence that reporters and fans exercise on Dylan after his ""electric turn"": in the most powerful moments of this picture, Cate Blanchett plays Dylan annoyed by the fame surrounding him and spreads cynical aphorisms while being interrogated by the press about what he means by his songs, his actions or his stances. And how should those be put together with his previous songs, actions and stances. But why should we strive to summarize all the disparate elements in a man's life into a coherent whole? After all, does a life of anybody have to be coherent to be worth living?"
"tmwest","8","2","4","11 January 2008"," a patchwork of great scenes and some not so great
","The idea of making different actors play the same character makes me think of psychodrama and also a play I saw many years ago called ""Tom Payne"" where if I remember correctly each actor was Tom Payne for a certain amount of time. Todd Haynes had a brilliant idea using many actors as Dylan and Cate Blanchett and Marcus Carl Franklin are superb. Almost all films that portray real characters have a problem in finding the right actor, because when they look alike, it is just that, and the other aspects of the personality are different. It is hard making a film about Dylan when most of what we know about his life was already told by Martin Scorseze. But this film creates great moments like when he is Woody Guthrie or when the song is played about Mr. Jones and Dylan(Cate Blanchett) tries to make Jones feel what it is to be a ""geek"". Significant key moments of his life are shown very effectively and there is only missing his relation to Judaism. The film is so good up to a certain moment that I could not avoid a certain frustration when it finishes and you feel that something is missing. I could not understand the point of the whole Richard Gere Billy The Kid sequence except from what I read after on IMDb, but if you have to be explained what a sequence is about, then something is not right. Never mind, I loved the film."

","I'm not there is a complex movie about a complex character in Robert Allan Zimmerman- better known to the world as Bob Dylan. What it attempts to do is focus on this complexity by picking it apart, slicing the periods and aspects of Dylan's life apart into separate people.<br/><br/>We have Ben Whishaw as Arthur who throughout the film, acts as a sort of compass to Dylan's mind and ethics by telling truisms; some contradictory. Christian Bale is Jack Rollins, representing not only the early 60s Dylan, who was held up as a reluctant folk martyr, and who is born again as Pastor John, representing Dylan's own spiritual dabbling in Christianity.<br/><br/>Marcus Carl Brodie plays Woodie Guthrie ( not the real one ), a young boy who evokes the mysticism of Dylan's youthful years. Cate Blanchett is Jude Quinn, representing Dylan's turn from folk martyr to rock storyteller, much to the chagrin of both the press and the folk community. Heath Ledger also turns up as Robbie Clark, whose movie career is balanced out by the break-up of his marriage, reflecting Dylan's own personal life as his ego got bigger and bigger. And finally Richard Gere represents Dylan the old exile through the character of Billy the Kid, who once again rises up to face those who would do people wrong.<br/><br/>The cast in this movie are very good, with Christian Bale excellent ( though underused ) and Cate Blanchett simply amazing as the defiant Quinn, seeming to ooze Dylan's personality with every pore of her body. However the fact of the matter is they have split up Dylan into 6 different people and while this seems like an interesting idea for a movie, none of these characters really is three dimensional enough to be seen as little more as examples to prove a point. The point may be an interesting one and very well made, but you still feel a little dudded.<br/><br/>Having said that though, I'm not there has some wonderful music and some great acting. Although the 6 personalities does get a little tiresome, it is an interesting way to look at a man who is hard to sum up as any."
"Win-5","6","2","4","27 December 2007"," All grump, no fun
","This movie does a great job of capturing Bob Dylan's angry, annoyed, snide, and generally unpleasant side, but shows nothing of the fun side - the closest that it comes is a brief shot of Dylan (portrayed by Cate Blanchett this time) cavorting with The Beatles, circa ""A Hard Day's Night,"" but even that devolves into an unhappy, drugged-out scene of Dylan stomping all over everyone's emotions, including his own. Come to think of it, that's how many of the scenes end up... Richard Gere's character is interesting, but was probably the least connected to any side of Dylan that I know. Young Marcus Carl Franklin was good, until he turned into something of a fraud. Ben Whishaw, Christian Bale, and Heath Ledger were convincing, but no fun. Where was the Bob Dylan who enjoyed life, who joked with his friends rather than insulting them, who toyed with journalists (as opposed to berating them), where was the obvious joy of ""Everybody Must Get Stoned""? My sneaky suspicion is that director/writer Todd Haynes doesn't actually like Dylan-the-man, even if he admires Dylan-the-songwriter (and singer, and poet, and all those other great things that Dylan's known for). So he made a mean-spirited movie, and spent a lot of time and effort on playing with the camera, and missed a big chunk of life."
"blackburnj-1","9","2","4","23 December 2007"," Some kind of genius
","Todd Haynes' bizarre take on the ""music and lives"" of Bob Dylan is an astonishing piece of work. Its visual style is inventive and enjoyable. The performances are universally brilliant. The direction is outstanding. The film is a sensual experience that will leave those who go into it with the right mind bemused, intrigued and satisfied.<br/><br/>This is a film that you have to want to see. Fans of Dylan should be entertained well and the more you know the more you shall enjoy. Haynes' script (written with Oren Moverman) makes the film seemingly difficult to follow and any background knowledge is helpful. However, it is a film that just happens: there is no need to follow it. As long as you have interest you'll never be bored.<br/><br/>The success of the film is based around a number of rock solid elements. First off, Haynes' frenetic editing gives the film an energy and sense of invention that should keep most enthralled.<br/><br/>If the film sags at any moment, all you have to do is look at the performances. Led by an astonishing turn from Cate Blanchett as Jude Quinn, the ""Dylans"" are superb. Bale and Ledger deliver performances that fit their impressive standard, whilst Richard Gere is an enjoyable presence. However, the two that impress most, other than Blanchett, are Ben Whishaw, who has little to do but delivers each of his lines perfectly, and Marcus Carl Franklin who is charming and completely gripping. Leading the supporting cast proper, we have Bruce Greenwood who is simply brilliant as Keenan Jones and Pat Garret.<br/><br/>If this isn't good enough for you, bask in Haynes' visual style. Each section has its own distinctive look and Haynes manages to fit in numerous striking images that are stunning. If you're still not satisfied, then there is bound to be a decent Dylan song around the corner.<br/><br/>The film is far from perfect. It isn't boring, but it is a bit too long and on occasions Haynes' stream of consciousness loses its audience.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the film provides little insight into Dylan and no coherent account of his life, but that isn't its intention. The final shot provides the simple message about a man and his music. This icon is shown in a wonderful way and remains enigmatic, but this is a film as much about the people who effected and were affected by Dylan. In short, this film is some kind of genius and has so much going for it that you are bound to get something out of it."

Maybe thats what I got most out of this film, wanting to completely re-examine my views of the meaning of the man and his music.

I suppose there is some justice in the portrayal of Bob Dylan by this bevy of talented actors, since Dylan's performances have always seemed to me to be a series of masks borrowed from others and used as persona. Don't get me wrong, I loved Dylan's early music when he was inventing himself, but this film adds little to my appreciation of the achievements of a singer who couldn't sing and was. as Joni Mitchell has observed, not a particularly good guitar player."

","As a disclaimer, I think it is important to say that I do not know a whole lot about Bob Dylan. I thought I knew enough when I started the film, and quickly learned I was wrong. ""I'm Not There"" excels as a work of art, and an anti-biopic – though it can be very enigmatic at times. The story tends to be hard to follow, as it jumps between characters and aspects of Dylan's work. This is most likely done on purpose, but it makes the narrative difficult to understand. This film is not one that allows the audience to sit back, an relax as they watch. It requires an attentive eye, and allows for an ambiguous definition, as the viewer must come to their own conclusion. After the movie has ended, you have to take the pieces of evidence given, much like pieces of a mosaic, and put them together yourself. In creating your own picture, you may find yourself missing a piece, not liking what you see, or wondering if you've put them together correctly. But that too is purposeful."

","Where to start here? I'm Not There is a very daunting, serious, far- fetching, high;y intellectual, brainy and at the same time, painful, awkward, clumsy, weird and sometimes sick movie with elements of great and gross, high and haughty, likable and lecherous, sweet and sick, fine and foolish. It reminded me heavily of Oliver Stone's Nixon, with its spiraling, non-linear, crazy pace, feedback, change of colors, abrupt jumps, foreshadowing, unexpected twists and all the same. Is this movie any good? Yes, it is. The performances of multitude of actors are all spellbinding and breathtaking - Marcus Carl Franklin, Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett, Richard Gere, Heath Ledger, Ben Whishaw,<br/><br/>Charlotte Gainsbourg , David Cross, Eugene Brotto, Bruce Greenwood, Julianne Moore, Michelle Williams, Mark Camacho, Benz Antoine , Craig Thomas, Richie Havens, Kim Roberts, Kris Kristofferson, Don Francks, Vito DeFilippo and Susan Glover, Paul Spence - an amazing array of huge talents and powerful bandwagon of artistry. Music is excellent throughout, too - the original Dylan's songs as well as new tracks are just superb. What is also good here - excellent play of allusions to Dylan's life - Newport fest, Judas shout, family problems, The Beatles, drugs, poetry, Tarantula, many other things are thrilling and a real eye- feast for Dylan fans. What is bad? Uneven pace, some mannerisms, some really vapid moments, some unnecessary longer monologues, some utterly silly moments at all - they spoil the party much. But still, even 2 hours are not long here and the movie flows almost (almost) seamlessly. Pity, it was not cut to a closer perfection. But, it is very hard to make a decent biopic. I do recommend this to Dylan buffs, to folk rock fans... the rest? Maybe, not. Todd Haynes has made a great work, but not all are ready to see Dylan played by a woman."

","I must admit that I approached this film with low expectations after having read several negative reviews before actually seeing the DVD. The comments, for the most part, were as follows : ""the movie made no sense"", ""it looked like it was made by high school film students trying to be artsy"", ""it wasn't an accurate depiction of Dylan at all"", and finally ""it was too long and too disjointed"". I disagree with all of those comments/assessments.<br/><br/>I found the movie to be interesting, creative, and engaging. And I'm not really even a big Dylan fan. But that notwithstanding, he's an interesting, complex individual who has had an enormous impact on not only the music industry, but the world at large.<br/><br/>And even taking Dylan totally out of the picture, I feel that the movie worked because of the way it accurately depicted the struggles of ANY creative personality when it comes to the conflicts and contrasts between the public and the private individual. I also feel that the movie accurately depicted the struggles any creative personality has trying to maintain his or her integrity once popularity -- and the attendant commercialism that goes with popularity -- kicks in. The aspect of how fans both support, and to a certain extent control an artist was also poignantly addressed.<br/><br/>For me, the most moving elements of the film involved the relationship between Robbie and Claire. I also was very impressed with Cate Blanchett's portrayal of Jude. The character that I found to be the least sympathetic (and/or the most disjointed) was Billy. But it was such a minor part that it wasn't enough for me to trash the film the way the other heavy critics did. I also found the soundtrack to be the glue as well as the engine that propelled the movie right along.<br/><br/>Maybe the most amazing thing about the whole film is the fact that Dylan SURVIVED, and is still a dynamic, vibrant force -- 45 years after his huge impact on the music scene and the world. Love him or hate him -- he has endured the test of time, and in true Sinatra fashion, he clearly did it his way."

","This film was much better than I thought it'd be. I had a vision of against-the-light moody, dingy talking heads, each trying to be/sing Dylan. <br/><br/>To me, Dylan is one of those influential enigmas, who hasn't touched me. I don't particularly want him to, either; it annoys slightly how some people get so infatuated with any one artist, likening them to some type of god. Spelt with a small g. I have to admire, however, his poetry and enormous contribution to contemporary music.<br/><br/>It's common knowledge that the music biopic is tired and retreads a set formula, one which generally works, though. But this means that the strength of the subject either makes or breaks it, which in some ways could be a good thing as it proves the fondness/credibility/portrayal of the artist. Trying to find an alternative approach is both brave and interesting and to my mind this film works very well.<br/><br/>It was always going to be a contentious and potentially troublesome project. Different actors, in skin colour, age, sex even, looks disastrous on paper. Apart from my complete failure to grasp Richard Gere's role, to the point where I found it easier to switch my mind off, it was engaging, interesting and absorbing. You could even not have known who Dylan was and simply enjoyed the 'life-story'.<br/><br/>Much has been said of Cate Blanchet's portrayal of the speed-addicted Dylan, which she was Oscar nominated for. Regardless of the novelty of her being a woman playing a man, it is the swinging 60's London monochrome mood, stylised, chic and impeccably conceived and acted, that does it for me. The smooth BBC type heckling from the TV presenter with its nagging 'society' views was akin to one long personal headache for Dylan and opposition from authority in general. Dylan's much vaunted betrayal on his (original) fans is obviously paramount as it's still a question being raised. But, what was it about Dylan that singled him out from all of the many other performers who changed their lifestyles, music, motives? Didn't Jim Morrison start out also as a poet? <br/><br/>For many, that question might not have been answered to satisfaction in this film, and maybe they'd feel let down because of this; but for me, who doesn't care all-that-much, a surprisingly refreshing experience."

Rather than trying to encapsulate Dylan's life in any serial fashion, Todd Haynes opts to intersperse the different incarnations of the singer in both his music and personal life, imbuing surrealism and pure fiction to explain the chaos of his life. That being said, I wouldn't recommend this movie to people who aren't familiar with Bob Dylan or the musical movements of the 1960s-1970s; references like Pete Seeger trying to chop the electric cables with an axe at the Newport Folk Festival or tongue-in-cheek humor such as Dylan shouting at Jesus on the cross to ""bring back your old stuff"" would definitely go over most people's heads without any background."

Most rock bio-pics while great at relating the biographical details, fail at the existential experience of the person. So, maybe the way to relate an avant garde life is through an avant garde film? We all have many selves within ourselves. Maybe it should be cellves, the different cellular aspects of our personalities that build the whole person. I'm Not There tries to capture the experience of Bob Dylan by breaking down the different aspects and personas Dylan has projected over the years of his fame. The young Woody Guthrie acolyte trying to find his voice, the Rimbaud rebel, the star, the born again preacher, the aged outlaw trying to lay low. A lot of writers, filmmakers, artists, and psychologists have all tried to break down the human psyche to one degree or another and I'm Not There does portray an interesting and complex personality in an interesting and avant garde manner.<br/><br/>Given it's experimental or avant garde credentials, I'm Not There isn't incomprehensible to the viewer. The portrayals of the different selves overlap and bleed into each other but the fragments fall together into the jigsaw of the whole. You just may have to spend a little time to let it all play out before you.<br/><br/>Probably the most daring aspect of I'm Not There is the casting of Cate Blanchett as Jude Quinn, the mid-60's era Dylan that went from folk music to electric. This could have been nothing but a cheap gimmick to flaunt the experimental nature of the film. But it isn't a gimmick, you quickly forget Blanchett is a woman playing a man, or in the context of the film you're never really conscious of it. It fits in with all the other portrayals in the film. Each is a subtle, nuanced fragment. Christian Bale's usual knock you over the head delivery is toned down to match the rest of the film. Richard Gere as the aging outlaw living in the surrealistic village of Riddle that's full of anachronisms and you're never sure if it's set in the 19th and 20th century. Gere's performance is sympathetic to a man trying to live out quietly his later years without all the fanfare and attention his early celebrity generated. A feeling I'm sure Gere can relate to. Another performance I really liked was David Cross as Allen Ginsburg. Cross leaves behind all his comic goofiness and delivers a nice little cameo.<br/><br/>The movie admits it's failure to categorize Dylan in the title, I'm Not There. As soon as you think you've nailed down the complexity of a person they've moved on.<br/><br/>Special Features-There's an Introduction to the film that gives you a little thumbnail synopsis of the personas.

The film portrays the musician in an array of six characters each representing an aspect of Dylan's life. The solid cast and genius story telling makes this film worth while.<br/><br/>The movie begins with first incarnation of Dylan is the character Woody (Marcus Carl Franklin), a young African American boy who has run away and is riding the rails. He tells different stories of his origin to different people. He travels around telling his story and plucking a few tunes out on his guitar. The next Dylan-esquire character we meet is Arthur Rimbaud (Ben Whishaw). Arthur is a poet being questioned by the law. His answers are used to introduce or provide insight for the other characters and their story lines. The following character to be brought into this story is Jack Rollins (Christian Bale). Rollins is a caricature of Dylan during his protest song era. Jack is followed by his fans to the end of the earth. But, when he is given the Thomas Paine award he goes off into a drunken rage at all the people at the award ceremony. Jack flees afterwords and is reincarnated later in the film as Pastor John, a Born Again Christian minister. Robbie Clark (Heath Ledger) is an actor who is starring in a biography film about Jack Rollins. Robbie's life off screen draws parallels to Dylan's relationship with his wife and children. Jude Quinn (Cate Blanchett) is the Bob Dylan of 1965. Jude is the iconic Bob Dylan being harassed by fans and the media for taking his music in another direction. Billy the Kid (Richard Gere) is the famed cowboy who has escaped from the law and has settled into the town of Riddle. This draws on Dylan's obsession with outlaws, especially Billy the Kid.<br/><br/>Generally the cast of ""I'm Not There"" is pretty good. Cate Blanchett is stunningly great as Jude and her performance gets closer than any's as Bob Dylan. The film is at its best when she is on screen. I did find Arthur's subtle commentary throughout the film to be rather good as well. Bale, Franklin, and Ledger also give solid performances as their Dylans.The weak link of this movie is Richard Gere. I don't blame Gere, though. He tries to make due with what he is given. The character Billy just isn't that interesting.<br/><br/>""I'm Not There"" has an original, fresh, and peculiar story and an all star cast that makes it worth seeing.

Let me say that times it is a little confusing- but it amazing, and is that not who Dylan is? Sometimes he is confusing, incoherent and random- but he is always amazing. Kate Blanchett does well and I never once thought, 'that is a chick?' Bravo as well to Ben Whishaw who serves as the narrator/wisest of all Dylans,in my opinion. The rest of the cast does shine in their given arenas.It was actually nice to see Richard Gere, something I never thought I would admit, but he did well in his bizarre little world.

He's not the random footnote thrown in to round out the movie. He is 100% deliberate and fantastic. He is the recluse, the old hat, the man that has seen that, been there, and done it all. That is Dylan today. Maybe it makes sense that the newer Dylan records have been criticized for their difference from his old stuff, and the movie captures it. Gere, while not cross-dressing like Cate Blanchett, is great in every respect and deserves recognition.<br/><br/>My second favorite character is Arthur, played amazingly by Ben Whishaw. The mannerisms are similar to Dylan, and he played a sort of Dylan-on-trial Dylan, and he nails the sarcasm. He delivers some classic lines, and his character acts as the Dylan that doesn't believe he has to explain himself.<br/><br/>Heath was fantastic, as usual. He and Charlotte Gainsbourg had fantastic chemistry together and share some of the most raw scenes. He is Cassanova Bob - the ladies man if there ever was one. Forget ""The Dark Knight,"" this movie is a true tribute.<br/><br/>Cate Blanchett comes in a little behind Heath for me. While she does deliver a great performance as nihilist/existential Dylan, her sequences dragged out too long for me to really enjoy them. Part of the reason the movie press revolved around her was because the movie was mostly her. The size of her part is far larger than that of, say, Gere's or Franklin's. I do, however, think that she was cheated at the Oscars. Swinton was not good enough that year to beat out Blanchett.<br/><br/>Marcus Carl Franklin, while great as an 11 year-old calling himself Woodie Guthrie, attempting to find himself through lies, wears after a little while. His first few scenes are charming and cute, and then his story gets a little tiring. It picks up at the very end when he and Billy the Kid (Gere) meet, completing the circle of Dylan identities. The kid has a great voice though; he's one of the only cast members to have a recording on the soundtrack.<br/><br/>Christian Bale's character did little/nothing for me. While the significance of his character is important to the overall plot, the Jack Rollins ""born-again"" sequence also drags on a little too long to be effective.<br/><br/>All the supporting actors are great. Bruce Greenwood is good in two roles as the infamous ""Mr. Jones"" and the iconic ""Pat Garrett."" Like I said earlier, Gainsbourg is fantastic on her own and with Ledger. Michelle Williams is good where she needs to be.<br/><br/>Overall, this film will leave you a little punch-drunk while you try to figure out how Bob Dylan could possibly be all of those people. And then you realize that he is. He is the poet, prophet, outlaw, fake, icon, and the star of electricity. And this is the film that captures some of the man and puts it in terms that you may not fully understand the first time you watch it, but you just know it's good."

","I guess this is another one of those films that does require the viewer (for the most part) to actually like the subject matter. For me, being Dylan's biggest fan, this was never an issue but it still needed, as a ""project"" film, to be well cast and well scripted. It was.<br/><br/>Personally I thought everyone worked well but particular kudos to Cate Blanchett who is extraordinary as the young Dylan. So convincing in every way that for a moment I forgot who was playing the role. Marcus Carl Franklin as ""little Woody"" was also incredible, Julianne Moore is always superb and carried the ""Joan Baez"" role with uncanny beauty and even Richard Gere shone in his brief ""Billy the Kid"" role.<br/><br/>These sort of multi faceted 'people' films (think Crash, Magnolia, Bobby etc) work if the story is good. Maybe they don't always have to stay 100% true to the base storyline, although those who know enough about Dylan's life and music will certainly feel that his many facets were very well represented here, but they do have to be entertaining. I loved this movie as I thought I would, because above all else it was entertaining. Could've been a disaster but if you love Dylan's philosophy as well as his music, you'll love this."

","In the foyer of a local cinema I heard a person refer to I'm Not There as a 'hagiography' of Bob Dylan; sure, this film celebrates the music and the shape shifting character of Dylan but it is also critical of the legendary figure. Todd Haynes' refreshing biopic explores Dylan through six actors and seven characters, not one of whom is explicitly called Bob Dylan. Like Haynes' earlier music biopic Velvet Goldmine which was about a Bowie-esquire figure, this story plays loose with truth and biopic conventions.<br/><br/>Narrated loosely by the poet-Dylan 'Arthur' (Ben Whishaw) and framed around the death of film star-Dylan 'Robbie' (Heath Ledger RIP) in a motorcycle accident, Dylan's story begins with 'Woody Guthrie' (the young black Marcus Carl Franken), painting Dylan as a pretender with boxcar blues aspirations. Folk star 'Jack' (Christian Bale) becomes a counter culture folk icon, which he'll eventually reject by going electric. Bale later reappears as 'Pastor John', a born again Christian. Aforementioned 'Robbie' is a star burning too bright, in a touching and painful relationship with Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg). Cate Blanchett is electric period pop star Dylan, who is seen toying with the British pop establishment. Finally Richard Gere's 'Billy the Kid' portrays Dylan as an outlaw.<br/><br/>You'd be forgiven thinking that there is little to link them in outside of their inspiration and you'd be right; I'm Not There tells the story of each Dylan in a unique cinematic style, reflective of the time they represent, and without a plot thread linking stories, but this wonderfully serves the purpose of portraying Dylan as chameleon figure he is and lifts this above the staid biopic style. Each of the actors is suited to their roles, with special mention belonging to Cate Blanchett, who is utterly convincing in her portrayal of Dylan. This might not be everyone's cup of tea, but Todd Haynes should be commended for his adventurous and excited approach. Great soundtrack too."

","Enjoying ""I'm Not There"" requires a level of acceptance that Dylan is somewhat more than just a well-respected pop star, or even a ""living legend."" The fact that the movie works at all partially confirms that idea: it's impossible to imagine a movie like this being made about Paul McCartney or even Mick Jagger. We know too much about them to get taken in. Dylan is that rare animal who has achieved massive fame without compromising an essential sense of mystery. He may be the last such animal ever.<br/><br/>This mystery is crucial, because ""I'm Not There"" is not about Dylan's life; it's about how Dylan is PERCEIVED -- by his fans, his friends, and even by himself. <br/><br/>First we meet Dylan-the-Poser (played engagingly by Marcus Carl Franklin, age 11). This is Dylan as he must have seemed when he first arrived in the New York scene: an impossibly precocious youth, already self-mythologized, seemingly ready to take his place among blues and folk legends whose lives he was too young to have lived, cooed over yet patronized by those who take him in.<br/><br/>The Poser seems happy enough with this treatment; but from beneath the ruse emerges Dylan-as-Rimbaud (Ben Whishaw), the sharp-eyed, passionate poet. He speaks directly to the camera, directly to us. (""That's what makes him different,"" his fans thought then, ""it's like he's speaking directly to me."") Swiftly on his heels (following Julianne Moore's amusingly accurate Joan Baez) is Dylan-the-Idealist (Christian Bale, very good). He's the Dylan that sang at civil rights marches, so seemingly pure in his truth-telling that he rejects the society that wants to honor him. (In one of the movie's most intriguing touches, this same Dylan is the one who is later ""born again."")<br/><br/>But all too soon appears Dylan-the-Star (Heath Ledger), an actor who gained fame by playing the rebellious Idealist in a movie, whom we follow through a stormy relationship (it's the one Dylan's fans must've felt they were in -- in love with that guy who betrayed them, who turned out to be an egomaniac fake). Then, in the movie's most inspired stroke, comes Dylan-the-Concealer (Cait Blanchett). It's a coup: Blanchett transforms herself from one of the world's most elegant women into a scruffy, squawking proto-punk, desiccated and wired. There's a jittery thrill to her performance; she plays it as if at any moment we'll discover she's entirely the wrong actor for the part, which of course makes her perfect. She keeps one arm crooked in front of her to help conceal her shape; Dylan did too. Under siege from press and fans, the Concealer talks a mile a minute, leaping from one defense to the next -- humor, apathy, venom, and finally, brilliantly, nonsense. This segment is Haynes at his most fun, layering his pop associations so densely that we feel like we're watching ""8 1/2"", ""A Hard Day's Night"" and ""Don't Look Back"" superimposed.<br/><br/>What the Concealer's concealing is the final incarnation, Dylan's Self-Image (a fine Richard Gere). This is Billy the Kid, a rumpled, soft-spoken outlaw only looking for peace in a town of his own imagination. These gorgeously-filmed sequences, mystifyingly drubbed by the critics (had they ever listened to the lyrics?), in fact provide the film's sweetest and most affecting moments, including Jim James' lovely, haunting rendition of ""Going to Acapulco"".<br/><br/>The movie's not flawless. It drags at times, and frustrates at others. But it stuck with me, and it got me to think about its thesis: that part of what is important about any human achievement is the real, complicated human who achieved it. Take a look at a photo of Einstein. You may not understand the Theory of Relativity, but you understand the face. Wise and fragile, open and mysterious. This person, you think, was on to something. You want to know more."

","Todd Haynes's complex portrait is an endeavor to wholeheartedly take into account the paradoxical conflicts and ambiguities of Bob Dylan by fabricating itself upon vast inconsistencies. Haynes's method is to craft six Bob Dylans and use six actors to play them. In this fashion, each Dylan is coherent and unswerving on his own terms, and the existence of Bob Dylan all together need not bind collectively.<br/><br/>There are so many Bob Dylans that it is easier said than done to place which ones you like, and on which you look down. I have never followed his work or his career other than finding a small handful of his songs to be catchy, but many people spent years detesting Dylan on the foundation of one thing and then submitted to a change of heart after another thing years later. Rarely has such a publicized celebrity internalized himself so indulgently as to obscure his trajectory and conceal his essence, and ultimately, the masses are left with the work, which is all the creator is truly obliged to contribute to them.<br/><br/>What Haynes achieves is the deduction of the heartening parentheses and forays that maintain that everything springs and seems sensible, and to illustrate what is in actuality disorder and confusion beneath the versatile juxtaposition of each strand of the movie. One of the actors is a little black kid who claims to be Woody Guthrie; a second is a Greenwich Village folk singer played by Christian Bale, a third is Heath Ledger, appearing in the same film but never in the same shot as his future blockbuster counterpart Bale, as a performer acting in a Hollywood movie, who takes it easy and starts a family, a fourth is Cate Blanchett curiously in one of her most arousing screen appearances as a folk hero who estranges his followers by changing from acoustic to electric, a fifth is an actor played by Richard Gere appearing in a western about Billy the Kid, a sixth is a Dylan surrendering to a controversial interview regarding his career, and then we double back again to Christian Bale, who plays a purposely skewed agent of ambiguity, either a seventh Dylan or a renovation of the first, now a born-again Christian.<br/><br/>No attempt is presented to rationalize how these Dylans are really one whole Dylan, which is the purpose. By fashioning this patchwork of Bob Dylans, Haynes assembles a portrait not of the man but of our incompatible perceptions. Coming away from ""I'm Not There,"" one has replenished one's palette for a few of Dylan's songs, we've seen six exceptionally able actors put to the test for the first time in a long time by taking on the roles of components of a total person. And I was very fond of the Fellini references in Cate Blanchett's thread."

","Brilliant, insightful, and so truly original - it could be the start of a whole new genre. If you like Dylan, you've got to see this film with the volume turned way up. Forget about what anyone else thought about it. Make up your own mind. For me the inspired performances and the sheer musical genius was completely mind-blowing. The film also succeeds in paying tribute to genius without the usual sentimental clap-trap. Yes - getting this close to one's hero isn't recommended. No-one is perfect after-all, but the music certainly is. The film's unique multi-faceted approach succeeds in highlighting the dichotomy of Dylan's life and his music. Long live the music!"
"btodorov","9","0","0","25 August 2008"," Bob Dylan as Elvis Presley
","I will avoid any comments on the cinematography, acting and so on. Let's say I understand nothing of these. I will just share with whoever cares to read what I got from the movie. I got the following: First/ Bob Dylan wanted to be Elvis Presley. He wanted to sing songs in front of many people. He knew very well he could not be exactly Elvis, since his abilities were of completely different kind, yet his ambition was just that: to become famous, sell records and stage shows. And because he was smart, he targeted a particular audience, actually two audiences at the same time: the working-class people who felt abused and needed an outlet of their anger, and the lovers of poetry, of all social stands, who were looking for what Elvis (or the Beatles) could not offer: lyrics rich in content, difficult to be interpreted and offering a lot to the imagination. Second/ Bob Dylan's ""treason"" of the mid-60s was a normal thing to do for an artist looking for new grounds to explore and new listeners to win. Especially when, in addition to being smart and ambitious, he was concerned - much more than the other pop stars of the day - with his ability to re-create himself and run away from the clutches of critics obsessed with plain and clear-cut categories. ""Mr. Jones"" who transcends the accusing BBC journalist and is retransfigured in the lovely, imaginary, artistic and politically minded French wife is the real focus of the movie - a matrix that gave shape to the six Dylans. Dylan spent long time running away from the Mr Joneses and because of them he tried to never ""be there"". Which explains why he was practically absent from a movie dedicated to him - a great choice and one that Dylan himself understandably approved. But Dylan is not there for a more general reason as well. The same conflict between the Elvis who wants fame and success and the true artist who wants freedom of expression is one valid for practically every creator - writer, musician, painter, etc. Thus, this is a movie about any really substantial artist of the last five hundred years with just the records of one Bob Dylan in the background. So if this is what the movie was all about, then I like it a lot."
"RainDogJr","10","0","0","6 August 2008"," How does it feel?
","As you all know six actors represent different roles that together represent a life. My first thoughts after watching it were in the way of how different is the film of what I was thinking before and that's the first fascinating thing about it. With the different styles you can see it as a sort of a compilation of short films that even could have been made by different directors but the narrative doesn't allow specially with the Dylan of Christian Bale. But all is absolutely and extremely enjoyable. The kid Dylan is a fake, a kid who speaks like an - experimented- adult, a ""blues kid"" who has been changing a lot but maybe the only change that he felt was relevant was the subject of his blues. Of course we can relate this part with the ""final"" part, the part with the Dylan of Richard Gere, who is just in a place that nobody knows. Is great how there is a subject (Bob Dylan) and upon that, of course, all the different stories are connected with the spirit but we can see them as individuals in their own ""world"" with their own story and that feels really unique. A great thing is how really connected are the Dylan of Christian Bale and the Dylan of Heath Ledger. The second is an actor portraying the first one. You see in the first one the new sensation of folk music and you know more about him with present-days interviews, of course with people who knew him (Julianne Moore is here as Alice Fabian). You see the second one in his personal life more than in his professional life. Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg) is the woman of his life, his soul mate and the mother of his children. ""I Want You"" is so great, so great. The Dylan of Blanchett is changing constantly and everybody around him is afraid of that. They want to have a secure concept, a unique concept of him. He can't give that. It is probably the most famous period, when the parties were for him as the Andy Warhol parties were for Morrison. The ""Ballad of a Thin Man"" moment is perfect, just perfect as the rest of the songs in each moment of the film. Dylan's lyrics are all.<br/><br/>It is not relevant, I never knew that well the name Heath Ledger when he was alive. I watched ""The Patriot"" yet I don't remember him in it. I know the acclaimed ""Brokeback Mountain"" yet I haven't watched it. I have just seen him as the joker, now as Robbie, he made two magnificent performances. Is not relevant also, the first film that I saw with Bale was from 2005 and since then I never saw another with him until this year with the sequel, later in American Psycho and now here. Charlotte Gainsbourg is also amazingly powerful as the unique woman who made a real connection with Dylan in the film. Cate Blanchett is really Dylan and that's impressive and she is my favourite although the entire cast is simply superb.<br/><br/>Then this is a fascinating film and it deserves to be watched at least more than a single time. On that way the DVD has 2 discs so in consequence really interesting material, from the usual rare footage, the director commentary and the galleries to a lot of information about Bob Dylan. Probably the most interesting material is the compilation of different conversations with the director Todd Haynes together with the 20 minutes documentary about the music of the film but still I haven't watch all the bonus material. Also it includes a little homage to Heath Ledger and the six actors making their own ""Subterranean Homesick Blues"" video - probably my favourite extra footage. In short it is a really complete DVD.<br/><br/>Finally, ""I'm Not There"" is something different, a film that must be enjoyed not only by fans of Bob Dylan but by music lovers and of course cinema lovers. Surprisingly or better ridiculously some people were considering ""Juno"", and some others, for best film of 2007 and even a certain -extremely- famous critic give ""Juno"" that place. This one is my personal choice. I love it, I love it yes I love it so bad."

The aspect of people seeing their icons as God and then as devils proves the thin line celebrities balance on.<br/><br/>Christian Bale as Jack Robbins was apt. Cate (Jude) was out standing deserving the nomination in Oscar. Heath Ledger, the person no more, watching him on screen was a painful understanding of not existing in flesh and blood.

","In making a movie about the legendary musician/songwriter/poet/social activist Bob Dylan, filmmaker Todd Haynes could have hired a single actor to impersonate his subject and then related the key events of his life in standard chronological order. But Haynes clearly had something deeper and more complex in mind when he envisioned this work. The result, ""I'm Not There,"" is a boldly original movie that is part truth and part deliberate fiction, part straight-forward narrative and part pseudo-documentary, part stark realism and part surrealistic fantasy. And while all of the elements don't work equally well together, the movie as a whole still provides a fascinating portrait of one of the key artists and musicians of the second half of the 20th Century.<br/><br/>Haynes breaks one of the cardinal rules of biographical storytelling right off the bat by having no fewer than six actors - Cate Blanchett, Heath Ledger, Christian Bale, Richard Gere, Ben Whishaw and Marcus Carl Franklin - portray Dylan at various stages of his career and life. And, in an act of even greater audaciousness, he has assigned each of these roles a different fictitious name (and it isn't because Haynes feared he might be sued for his efforts since Dylan himself okayed the movie). Haynes, with the assistance of co-writer Oren Moverman, then arranges the various pieces into a time-shifting mosaic that allows us to see Dylan at all those discrete moments in his life virtually simultaneously. Finally, he incorporates many of Dylan's songs on the soundtrack to serve as a sort of running commentary on both the character and the times in which he's living.<br/><br/>Haynes makes it clear that Dylan was as much a product of those times as he was a shaper of them. The film shows us his early days as an idealistic young singer/songwriter (here named Woody after Dylan's boyhood hero and role model Woody Guthrie), who has just escaped from a juvenile detention facility and is now riding the boxcars, his guitar in hand, strumming out protest songs in defense of the underprivileged and working classes. We then follow Dylan through the various stages of his life: first, as Jack (Bale), a rising young folk singer in Greenwich Village; then as Jude (Blanchett) an anti-establishment pop culture hero, singing and speaking out against social injustice and the Vietnam War; later (still as Jude), as a press-hounded ""celebrity"" often denounced as a ""sellout"" for adopting the very elitist lifestyle he'd earlier railed against in his works. The roles assigned to Ledger and Gere provide even more radically oblique takes on the Dylan persona. Ledger plays Robbie, a Hollywood actor who's portraying Jack (i.e. Dylan) in a film on his life, while Gere represents an aging version of Dylan, envisioned here as Billy the Kid, living in the wild west and taking on the legendary Pat Garrett in an effort to save a small town from being subsumed by an evil corporation (this is definitely the most ""out there"" of all the story lines in the film and, without a doubt, the least compelling and effective).<br/><br/>Of the actors, Blanchett gets to play Dylan at what is probably the juiciest and most provocative period of his life (at least from a character standpoint), the time when he alienated many of his earliest fans by ""reinventing himself"" as it were - turning away from traditional folk music in favor of a much edgier rock'n'roll sound, and transforming his own image from that of a jeans-wearing man of the people to that of a sunglasses-sporting, Carnaby-clad - and now quite remarkably cynical - pop culture celebrity. Blanchett's vivid performance captures the tormenting self-doubt of a man caught between being a ""spokesman"" for a social movement and a simple human being trying to survive in the very world he's being called upon to denounce. The movie raises the question of whether it is ever possible for an artist to remain a social iconoclast after he has attained the level of a cultural icon - with all the attendant compromise that comes with such a status.<br/><br/>Next to Blanchett, Ledger gives what is probably the most fully-rounded performance in the film, fleshing out the domestic side of the public figure in his thoughtful portrayal of Dylan as husband and father.<br/><br/>Haynes' eclecticism involves the mixing together of not only various time periods but of wildly varying film-making styles as well. For instance, some of the stories are shot in black-and-white while others are done in color, just as he uses a traditional narrative technique in some sequences yet documentary-style reportage in others.<br/><br/>The film does suffer from a number of serious, though nowhere near fatal, flaws. As noted earlier, the Richard Gere section comes across as too arbitrary and tacked-on to feel fully a part of the rest of the film. And the movie does run on a trifle longer than it needs to in order to make its point. Moreover, the overly objectified style of the movie, impressive as it is, nevertheless, has the perhaps inevitable effect of distancing us so much from the subject matter that the heart, as opposed to the head, is never really fully engaged in what it is showing us.<br/><br/>Still, for the sheer unadulterated love Haynes demonstrates for his medium and the insight the movie offers into a beloved cultural icon, ""I'm Not There"" is a work very much worth savoring, faults and all."
"bloodymonday","10","0","0","25 June 2008"," Review: I'm Not There
","""I'm Not There"" is Todd Haynes's ode to ""the many lives of Bob Dylan"". It's a film that reconstructs his body of work in a very idiosyncratic kind of way. While this film is not really about the life Bob Dylan himself, but merely his role that made an impact to American culture. After we've watched it, we might not have a clue who he really is. But please rest assures that we will definitely know what Bob Dylan means to this world.<br/><br/>Truth be told, I ain't familiar with his life and work. And with this ignorance that I have, it's causing me (and people like me) immensely confusion to the film. But that's not is an excuse to not watching this film. Instead, it will enthusiastically encourage people to find out any references that we've seen in the film. In fact, it affected me so deep that I'm ready for prepare Dylan's work in both off-screen and on-screen. There's 1967 D.A. Pennebaker's documentary ""Don't Look Back,"" and Martin Scorsese's 2005 doc ""No Direction Home: Bob Dylan"" that I have yet to watch.<br/><br/>What succeed in Todd Heynes's ""I'm Not There"" is that he didn't bombard us with biographical information about Dylan's life. This is not ""Ray"" or ""Walk the Line"" (by all mean, those are good movies) which attempted to show us in both the man's life and his myths. ""I'm Not There"" isn't one of those movies. It didn't really care for the man's life, but only in his myths. Therefore the film is very loose and kind of a free-form to give an opinion about what we've just seen (which is absolutely relevant to the way Dylan lives his life). And it's emphasizing even more when the director employed the total of six actors to play many fractions of one titular character.<br/><br/>Speaking of Todd Heynes, I think he's pure breed of art-house director that has one special talent. And that's he really knows how to bring his artsy films into a mainstream. ""Far From Heaven"" is not only a film that ode to 50's Douglas Sirk's melodrama, but also explore a hidden gay subtext in those films. ""Velvet Goldmine"" is his ambition to re-imagine Orson Welles's ""Citizen Kane"", but with glam-rock extravaganza era. In my opinion, ""I'm not There"" is probably one of the most dedicated and ambition work so far.<br/><br/>This movie surely will pleased many ardent fans and will create some new fan base (like me). I think it's necessary that you should watch this film for a second times (deservedly experience, I would say). And please, please don't try to make sense with this film whatsoever. Because, in the end, you'll know it's not a point that this film trying to make after all."

And although this movie quickly goes beyond it boarders, it's not expected that you'll always know what's going on, you just need to watch, because there's always compelling things happening here. Director Todd Haynes does not achieve an all-round experience, not only because this is more oddity than the average, but because the six stories are different in quality, depth and interest; Gere's Billy the Kid silent outlaw doesn't truly find his place, almost like it's a miscast - but Cate Blanchett is nothing short of breathtaking in her performance, clearly portraying the mid 60ties Dylan whose progression into electric rock was booed at by his biggest fans. Her performance surely should have anchored her an Oscar, not just for walking and talking like Dylan, but because she gets under his skin more than any of the five other; every time she's appearing on the screen the movie catches fire, just like the audience did in both disgust, anger, surprise and shock as when Dylan went electric, her/his appearance is if anything magnificent.<br/><br/>The troubled personal-life of Dylan seems as a difficult task, as Charlotte Gainsbourg's Claire tells him that he's changed and walks away. And Dylan changes, all of the time - and sometimes it even feels like he doesn't know himself what he's trying to get away from, but Dylan's appearance through all of the six performances, seems uninterested in looking into his own making, as it seems to surround him and lock him in instead of inspire or satisfy him. They shouted that Dylan had become an egoistical artist, an artist who's so busy with changing himself that he goes to extreme measures just to get away from everything that tries defining him may be too much for the average listener/watcher, and therefore I'm Not There' does an excellent job in capturing Dylan's chameleon-life. The absurdity, the sadness, the wisecracks, the political, the angry, the confused, the lovely and the tender; Dylan's poesy goes beyond."

","I'm a big fan of Dylan's and have been familiar with him almost my entire life, and I have to say that it took ALL I knew about him to help me try to navigate any understanding of this film. (Was I successful? Only in small starts with a lot of stops.) I VERY much value this film for what I DID get out of it, but you could take 50% of this movie out, minimum, and leave in everything that I even halfway comprehended. For that reason I TOTALLY understand anyone not liking this film. <br/><br/>All that said, I have to watch it at least one more time because it is a rare film in which I feel it has something to teach me and I want to get everything out of it that I can. (I actually found myself taking notes during my first viewing when the ""Rimbaud"" Dylan was listing the things a person who wants to hide must do: <br/><br/>1 - never trust a cop in a raincoat, 2 - beware of enthusiasm and of love, each is temporary and quick to sway, 3 - when asked if you care about the world's problems look deep into the eyes of he who asks -- he will not ask you again; 4 - never give your real name, 5 - and if ever told to look at yourself, never look, 6 - never say or do anything the person standing in front of you cannot understand, 7 - never create anything -- it will be misinterpreted, it will chain you and follow you for the rest of your life and it will never change.<br/><br/>I take it he meant if you want to hide from fame. When I start taking notes it means I'm REALLY enjoying it. I thought there was supposed to be an 8, 9 and 10 in that list but either they weren't there or I missed them.<br/><br/>I have to compliment the director of this film because it was a very brave endeavor. Both the script and the editing were amazingly psychedelic on a very fundamental level. I thought some of the dialog was really excellent (though I sure wish I knew which was fact and which was fiction, but at least with this film you KNOW it's not all factual rather than like reading a newspaper that PRETENDS to be all factual but isn't).<br/><br/>After watching this film I made a mental note that I really must get hold of more Dylan CDs for my collection, and also must seen the documentary Martin Scorcese made about Dylan in 2006 (the title of which escapes me right now). Oh, and one more thing: my favorite actors in the film were great and must be mentioned: Blanchette (the only one that really seemed like Dylan and the only one really meant to seem like Dylan) and the lady that played his wife (sorry, don't know her name but she had a lot of screen time and that didn't bother me a bit)."

","Bob Dylan, in my humble opinion, is the greatest American singer/songwriter in the history of American music. Todd Haynes does an excellent job of covering this man's epic life. Using six different people, including a woman and an African American kid, to portray Dylan is risky, but it pays off very well. The fact that we get to hear Dylan's greatest hits on top of that is amazing. <br/><br/>The film is split into six segments. Jude (Cate Blanchete) is Dylan in the ""Don't Look Back"" era. He is a popular singer, outcast by the media and fans due to the complexity of his songs. Jack (Christian Bale) portrays Dylan the born again Christian. Woody (Marcus Carl Franklin) is a kid who idolizes the great Woody Guthrie, just like a young Dylan. Billy (Richard Gere) is Dylan the outlaw in a Billy the Kid vs Pat Garrity (Bruce Greenwood) story. Robbie (Heath Ledger) is Dylan the divorcée, an actor trying to hold on to his wife (Charlotte Gainsbourg). And Arthur (Ben Whishaw) is Dylan the poet.<br/><br/>Not only do the Dylans impress me (Blanchette especially), the supporting cast portrays important figures in his life as well, including Suze Rotolo (Gainsbourg), Allen Ginsburg (David Cross), Joan Baez (Julliane Moore) and Edie Sedgewick (Michelle Williams). The musical segments are very creative as well. The song ""Ballad of a Thin Man"" is used to torment a reporter named Mr. Jones (Greenwood again) who dosen't understand Jude.<br/><br/>In conclusion Haynes succeeds in this: It is hard to make a biopic. When you do not intend to use your subject's name, it's downright hell. But Haynes is totally up to task. Now if only we could get him to remake ""The Doors""..."

It puts you in another state of reality for a bit and I find that to be refreshing compared to all the garbage movies that come out.<br/><br/>I, myself, had to watch the movie over the span of three days. Around the 50 minute mark, I just realized this was way too heavy to take in just one sitting. So I paused it, went out for a walk, came back rewound it a couple scenes back and started again. I did this over the span of two days. Then watched it without pausing.<br/><br/>Let me tell you, there are not many movies that will alter your mind from just watching it... but this one can do it.<br/><br/>Cate Blanchatt was amazing as well. I went to youtube to compare her acting and Bob Dylan's mannerisms. It's was wonderful. I appreciated it very much. (not to mention she was completely beautiful in such a role, mmhm, nothing better than androgyny.) So, if you're looking for a run-of-the-mill sort of movie that doesn't require any effort or thought... this isn't it.<br/><br/>But if you're looking for something refreshing, thought-provoking, and have patience to spend time on it, then please appreciate this movie.<br/><br/>The world knows we need more movies like this to balance out the crap that is in theaters now-a-days."

","Overall, the movie is extremely well-acted, somewhat interesting despite its relativity and abstract approach, and probably worth the watch.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, what we had assumed and expected was a powerful and interesting bio-drama of the life of legendary songwriter/singer Bob Dylan. What we quickly discovered was a confusing semi-clone of ""Across the Universe."" The person thought of as Bob Dylan is scattered into the lives of 4 different characters. Various real-life world events and persons are renamed, so there's little true continuity to the actual events and persons attached with this period in history known as the '60's and '70's.<br/><br/>Instead of simply dealing with facts and realities and a person well-known as Bob Dylan, the writers and producers give their scrapbook-cut interpretation of his life while attributing their views to fictional characters--- thereby sidestepping direct accountability while spicing it up in an aura of surreal abstract.<br/><br/>Dichotomy-- great acting, interesting movie (great if you're not expecting anything); huge disappointment if you were hoping for anything of a semblance of Bob Dylan reality."

More worked well then failed. I found Blanchett's and Ledger's parts to the be the best, and the worst to probably be Franklin's or Bale's. Performance wise I was most impressed with Blanchett, just like everyone else. She was perfect. Ledger and Whishaw were both also great, and there wasn't a bad member of the cast. I was very impressed with Haynes control over the film. This was one of the best directed films of the year. He knew what was happened all the time, and made a sort of controlled chaos. It's the most you can ask for in a direction. The film is very well made, but not for everyone. It never quite reaches greatness, but that hardly ever happens in films.

Directed by Todd Haynes, the movie has a slow rhythm but it never gets tired, the photography is excellent, the music is wonderful each story has a different Bob Dylan song that reflects perfectly ans space where the movie is. The cast is amazing, six actors characterized as Bob Dylan (Heath Ledger, Ben Whishaw, Christian Bale, Marcus Carl Franklin, Richard Gere and Cate Blanchett) everyone with flawless performances, specially Blanchett who earned an Oscar nomination for this role and in my opinion she deserved to win. The secondary roles like the ones of Jullianne Moore and Charlotte Gainsbourg give very good support performances.

"harry_tk_yung","Null","0","0","20 March 2008"," An interesting experiment
","An interesting experiment with its somewhat innovative style and technique hailed by some as ingenious and denounced by others as gimmicky (depending on which critic you listen to), ""I'm not there"" is not that different from the several singer biopics we've seen in the last little while: Jamie Foxx as Ray Charles (""Ray""), Kevin Spacey as Bobby Darin (""Beyond the sea""), Joaquin Phoenix as Johnny Cash (""Walk the line"") and recently crowned Oscar Best Lead Actress Marion Cotillard as Edith Piaf (""La vie en rose""). Come to think of it, the temporal scrambling therein is not that different from what you see in ""La vie en rose"".<br/><br/>Nor is the vicissitudes in life of Bob Dylan that different from many of these other singers: deprived childhood, substance abuse, marital problems, unpopular musical style changes, identity crisis. The unique thing about this movie's delivery of the singer's story is the technique of using six different characters to depict the various aspects of his life. (And this has absolutely nothing to do whatsoever with Luigi Pirandello's popular play ""Six characters in search of an author""). In each of these segments (which incidentally are liberally mixed, and seasoned with generously sprayed surrealism) there is a particular focus. In some of them, there are also prominent characters that the protagonist plays out the scenes with. Incidentally, all the six Bob Dylan have been given a different name.<br/><br/>For Dylan's pre-teen days, there is young, unknown black actor Marcus Carl Franklin. This segment depicts the first discovery of Dylan's musical talents. The second cut, featurimg Ben Whishaw (who was impressive in the lead role of ""Perfume: the story of a murderer""), is most unique. He appears only as the defendant in front of a law court. The lines he delivers, while purportedly answers to the judge's questions, are searching comments on Dylan's personality, serving as anchor for all the other segments. The final cut shows Richard Gere as a Dylan in his later stage, pensive, reflective and with a trace of remorsefulness.<br/><br/>The meat is in the remaining three cuts. Christian Bale's version is closest to Bob Dylan the singer that the public is most familiar with. Heath Ledger's version focuses on the domestic front. With marvelous French actress Charlotte Gainsbourg (""21 grams"", ""Lemming"") playing Dylan's wife, it follows the initial romance to the tragically failed marriage. Most publicized is of course Cate Blanchette's portrayal which secured for her Best Supporting nominations in all 4 major film awards (Oscar, Golden Globe, BAFTA, Independent Spirit) and wins in two (Golden Globe drama category and Independent Spirit). In this segment we see attempts to delve more deeply into the man Dylan, sometimes through rather surreal sequences. While most of this is soliloquy, we also see two other significant players: Bruce Greenwood (too many movies to quote) as a persistent journalist and Michelle Williams (Heath Ledger's wife in ""Brokeback Mountain"") as the other woman in Dylan's life.<br/><br/>Regardless of whether you like this ""experiment"" or not, which probably boils down to personal taste, it's a cinematic experience worth having, particularly with so much acting talents on display."

","It takes an unusual movie to do justice to an unusual man. ""I'm not there"" is anything but your run-of-the-mill biopic, but the question is, is it unusual enough? To the extent that Haynes succeeds, it is by not trying to give us the man himself. He plays with times, places, and, most importantly, names. It's an old habit of Dylan's to pick a name to fit (or mock) the occasion; born Robert Zimmermann, he has dubbed himself Terry Prendergast, Tedham Porterhouse, or Jack Fate in different contexts, to name but his most prominent aliases. But I feel Haynes could have gone further in deconstructing Dylan. A little more than half-way into the movie, there is a flat out surrealistic 5-minute segment revolving around BBC reporter Keenan Jones (Bruce Greenwood), set to ""Ballad of a Thin Man"". I wish there had been more of that. Nevertheless, you walk away from this movie thinking that the pieces don't quite fit, which I think of as a tribute to the patchwork persona Dylan has created for himself. Of course, he will keep changing it with whatever he sings, says, writes, and does. ""I'm not there"" reminds us what a strange and restless man he really is. Outstanding performances, among many others, by Ben Whishaw, Christian Bale, and Julianne Moore. She got Joan Baez' lilt exactly right. Also, I had no idea how hot Michelle Williams could be until I saw her in the part of party girl Coco Rivington."

While I was mesmerized by Cate Blanchett's performance (if it were only her the whole time, I might have given the movie an 8 or 9 as a vote!), there were other pieces that left me cold.

","I'm not there. (2007)  Directed by Todd Haynes There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman; some kind of abstraction. But there is no real me: only an entity, something illusory. And though I can hide my cold gaze, and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable... I simply am not there.<br/><br/>Ignoring the word simply, the last time I heard ""I'm not there"" was from the amazing film American Psycho  so the first thing that sprang to mind when I first heard of this title were these words uttered by Patrick Bateman. But alas this is something far different.<br/><br/>""I'm Not There"" the Biopic of the forever changing man Bob Dylan comes to us from Todd Haynes  already familiar with the music genre having delivered the highly original Velvet Goldmine back in 1998. The title stems from a previously unreleased Dylan recording of the title song ""I'm Not There"", which was recorded during the ""The Basement Tapes"" sessions. Haynes has set out on a Dylan Journey capturing the truth in the lies, grandeur, childishness and arrogance that made Dylan as notorious as he was and ever will be. Some have called him genius and if you're a fan of any of his work you will marvel at his rhymes and playfulness with harmonica and guitar. Haynes transports you into Dylan's mind as well from a side line through the eyes of many of the people that came across him over the years, by bringing us six incarnations of Bob Dylan: an actor, a folk singer, an electrified troubadour, Rimbaud, Billy the Kid, and Woody Guthrie. On top of this Todd Haynes with pure mixing skill and musical greatness that could probably only be emulated by Bob himself puts Dylan's music behind their adventures, soliloquies, interviews, marriage, and infidelity.<br/><br/>Before seeing this cinematic work  I had heard rumours that some of the cast were strong while others put in a weak performance. Well I'm not usually a fan of Richard Gere  his movies such as ""Shall we Dance"" should never had been made and I had heard a lot of bad press in regards to his performance but I think this simply may be down to people not really getting the reasoning behind him as Billy the Kid. Without ruining it for you Gere is a version of the elderly Dylan with the other stories being in the past of this story. This story focuses on Dylan's country life of the Woodstock era and his later years. A very solid performance from Gere - don't believe the haters.<br/><br/>It has been said before but I will say it again: Cate Blanchett turns in the strongest and most recognizable performance of Dylan playing the character Jude Quinn, a version of Dylan who was at the height of his fame in the 60's as he toured with the Beatles in London when his original fan base was rejecting him as a sell out  truly mesmerising and dream like sequences reminiscent of many 60's art films of the era and interviews given by Dylan.<br/><br/>Christian Bale (Jack Rollins) focusing on Dylan's early folk era and then later finding Christianity is as you would expect nothing but solid  will Bale ever do a bad movie? Reign of Fire isn't a bad movie! The late Heath Ledger turns in phenomenal performance in the form of the fictional Robbie Clark who focuses on Dylan's personal life and his brief appetite into the world of acting as he plays Bale's fictional character Jack Rollins in the film ""Grain of Sand"" referenced to 1981's haunting Gospel song.<br/><br/>The most enjoyable performance to watch musically probably comes from the very young and talented African American actor Marcus Carl Franklin (a name to watch I personally believe)  he is the traveling Dylan reminiscing about the past always on the run with the other hobo's while singing the Blues while giving youth and crossing borders to who Dylan is and was and wanted to be.<br/><br/>And last but by no means least a solid performance is put in by Ben Whishaw who is forever being questioned by what could be the CIA, FBI or just simply the establishment  spouting vague poetic meaning to his questions that some could interpret as meaningless but others will interpret to mean a thousand things that only Dylan could of come up with.<br/><br/>If you're easily confused and simple in the head and possibly not a fan of Bob Dylan or you have no appreciation for any of the above actors mentioned then maybe yes you won't enjoy this Biopic of a mysterious musician who was many things. But if you approach this with intrigue and the desire to escape into Todd Haynes world of Bob Dylan then you will find a highly rewarding 135mins that will urge you once again to dig out your old Dylan records for another play.<br/><br/>9/10  Well Done Todd Haynes"

Stephanie Zacharek wrote on Salon that it's hard to summarize the plot. That's because there wasn't one! It was like watching someone flip randomly through a coffee table book. Who can do that for more than five minutes? Half way through the movie I found myself more interested in the sheetrock on the ceiling than I was in the story, or lack thereof.

"jjcremin-1","6","2","5","6 January 2008"," Intriguing concept but somewhat problematic
","A good part of this movie is very influenced with Fellini's ""8 1/2"". one of the best surrealistic movie ever made loosely about a director in inner turmoil about what his movie is supposed to be about.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it doesn't stay with that visceral theme and the process of songwriting is never explored. In fact, Marcus Carl Franklin, the young black actor playing Woody Guthrie, plays the songs complete. His best segment is jamming with Richie Havens, obviously having a lot fun.<br/><br/>Christian Bale actually plays the Guthrie folk singer which for me remains Dylan's best work. He actually returns as Paster John, making a somewhat confused Christian preacher. Might as well add here, very little of Dylan's later songs are done, the focus is mainly the sixties and early seventies. somewhat establishing how irrelevant Dylan became except for his most die hard fans.<br/><br/>The most dead on impersonation as remarked by other reviewers is that of Cate Blanchett. Very telling here is how mean she plays it, yelling and ridiculing reporters who actually just respectfully doing their jobs and purposely vomiting in someone's lap was part of Dylan's insane behavior during this time period. There's a fun moment when one reporter becomes Mr. Jones to the tune of Dylan's ""Ballad of a Thin Man"" done quite well. The garden party scene is straight out of ""8 1/2"" Heath Ledger plays a more unlikable Dylan though it's this version that has Dylan with a wife, sensitively played by Charlotte Gainsbourough. The male superiority tirade that Ledger gets into has been confirmed that Dylan actually spoke those words at a restaurant.<br/><br/>Much criticized and I agree it's the weakest part of the movie is Richard Gere as Billy the Kid. However, it's the most aligned with Basement Tapes period, though the bulk of the songs were done in the sixties. The town Riddle, MO, is influenced by the 1975 album cover which is turn is influenced by Fellini. Even Kris Kristofenson's narration does little to tie the Gere character to ""Pat Garret and Billy the Kid"" My overall analysis is that Haynes bit off more than he could chew and the dark side of celebrity really could have gone darker as Dylan himself was famous for being furious at the hype he received.<br/><br/>That's what ""Ray"" succeeded in doing as well as the more recent ""La Vie En Rose"", both had the singer (Ray Charles, Edith Piaf) portrayed by one actor."

","Bob Dylan is one of the most legendary and innovative singers in Folk history and I can't think of any other way that a filmmaker could've done his life justice than this movie.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't follow the conventional biopic formula as it depicts his life through six different characters who represent different areas of Dylan's life. The film does a compelling exploration of the constantly changing music/entertainment industry and society throughout the 1900's in which inspired one of Bob Dylan's best songs ""The Times They Are A Changin"".<br/><br/>The direction, cinematography and editing are all outstanding along with amazing performances from all six actors playing incarnations of Bob Dylan including Cate Blanchett who should've won an Oscar for her performance and I consider hers to be the best performance of a recording artist in cinematic history so far.<br/><br/>I'm Not There is a great watch for all fans of Bob Dylan and for music and film fans in general."
"gabrieltdelima","9","1","2","27 July 2012"," The best movie about Bob Dylan that could ever be made; and also, one of the best about music.
","Let me begin by saying that this movie isn't made for everybody (which is a shame): To take the most out of it, the viewer has to understand a few things about Bob Dylan's history. Also, there has to be interest in his music, or in true music - art itself. So, if you don't know much about Bob Dylan, it's extremely important that you get your facts straight (and watching Martin Scorsese's ""No Direction Home"" it's the best way to do that) before watching this movie. <br/><br/>That being said, we can't talk about I'm Not There and it's series of fantastic achievements,as an biographical movie, and as a work of art - and it is nothing less than a brilliant, beautiful work of art.<br/><br/>I'm Not There it's an non-chronological, non-literal, multi-layered movie about a lot of things. First, it's about Bob Dylan. Second, it's about art, music, and the most striking segment of it, it's about love. <br/><br/>Director Todd Haynes pays homage, here, to a series of other movies; He makes visual and spoken references of Dylan's lyrics, of things Dylan said in concerts, of things that were said about Dylan, and even to other movies - Clearly referencing the already mentioned Scorsese's brilliant documentary, but also the classic ""Don't Look Back"", and ""Pat Garret & Billy The Kid"". All of those are direct visual references, and the final product of this is a very effective and successful synthesis of Dylan's extensive production - other subtle references, such as a couple of dirty, sad kids mourning a dead horse that we see for only a second (taking us back to Dylan's absolute classic ""A Hard Rain's A- Gonna Fall"" , in which he sings, ""I met a young child beside a dead pony""), helps the movie to capture Dylan's vast imaginary with nearly perfection. All of those are showed to us unchronologically, without any further explication - we know the characters that appear on the screen are supposed to be the same person, but Haynes presents us with a little black boy, an actor whose relationship with his wife is told with flashbacks and flash-forwards, and an androgynous rock star called Jude - all at the same time. It's a beautiful mosaic, and may even be a puzzle. Putting it together can be difficult, but extremely rewarding. <br/><br/>And that reward comes with an unique and brilliant artistic style. Each character, or each facet of this person, has it's unique tone, it's unique figurine and filmography. The music in this movie is formed exclusively of Dylan songs and Dylan covers, and there are some overwhelming musical sessions. You don't have to be a Dylan fan to get emotional in the ""Going to Acapulco"" segment, which features a burlesque aspect to it all. Very unique and beautiful. <br/><br/>The emotional core of the movie rests in the shoulders of Heath Ledger's character. It's a story of a failed marriage, of which we see it's beginning and it's ultimate tragic conclusion, that never fails to bring tears in my eyes. It's painful to watch, in the best way possible, and captures with absolute perfection the tone of the Blood on the Tracks record."

","I'm not a spoiler type of guy, but i'll mention a lil bit of this and a lil bit of that. First of all the cast is spectacular with majestic performances, and if someone would ask me why i think this way, i have a suggestion... Please watch Scorsese's No direction home- Bob Dylan and watch closely, and then you can see why Cate Blanchett, Heath Ledger and Christian Bale did a fantastic job, pure art. You're not there, you are everywhere... That's exactly how i feel about Dylan.

","This is my first exposure to Todd Haynes, who I understand is almost always taking this artistic of an approach to his material. There are, in fact, several different film-making styles utilized here; one for each narrative. I honestly don't know an awful lot about Dylan, and I think that you have to, in order to fully appreciate this(in any event, you should realize that this is not, nor was it intended to be, a bio-pic). Yes, there are six actors portraying him, and yes, one is a woman and another is an African-American kid(his performance is excellent... in fact, all of them are, not just this half a dozen of them). From what I do know about the man, they adopt traits of his, and are rather well-cast. They represent his many ""lives""; the FAQ explains them immensely well. This certainly is an interesting piece, and offers food for thought. It is philosophical at times. The dialog is well-written and delivered nicely. From a technical standpoint, this is marvelous; the editing and cinematography are skillful. Meanwhile, this will still alienate those expecting a mainstream treatment of the man's life, akin to Ray or Walk the Line. There is infrequent strong language, a little violence and disturbing content as well as brief nudity(male and female) and sexuality in this. The DVD comes with 24 minutes of extended scenes, a funny 4 minute gag reel, a 3 minute Heath tribute and a trailer for this and one for Forbidden Kingdom. I recommend this to fans of the singer, and those who enjoy the medium on other levels than that of presenting entertainment, or a straightforward story. 8/10"
"Red_Identity","Null","1","2","24 January 2010"," An Artistic Triumph!
","I'm Not There is a bold and artistic triumph, one which will be difficult for the mainstream audience to accept. The film is not the typical biographical drama. It's editing and multiple characters and story lines are meant to embody Bob Dylan and his life. The ensemble cast is magnificent. Cate Blanchett gives a tour-de-force performance that really gives all the characteristics and mannerisms of Bob Dylan. She deserved that Oscar. Heath ledger's storyline, along with Blanchett's, is the most fascinating of the film. Ledger also does some great work in one of his last films. Charlotte Gainsbourg, who plays his wife, does some terrific work, and you can see she is a very talented actress. Having seen her in Antichrist, where she delivers one of the most realistic and raw performances in some time, she is an actress to look out for. Christian Bale and Ben Wishaw also capture some of Bob Dylan's energy, and while they have the most limited screen time of the six actors, they are also fascinating to watch. The cameos by Julianne Moore and others are really brilliant and give the film a documentary feel. Marcus Carl Franklin and Richard Gere have the least involving scenes, but they are not enough to lessen the film's imagination. Todd Haynes is a risk-taker to create such a bold and imaginative film. I'm Not There is not a film where it's plot matters much, just because what is important is the way it makes the audience feel Bob Dylan's presence, which is something that most autobiography films do not do. I'm Not There is an artistic cinematic experience that should be the kind of film people should celebrate."
"Indyrod","9","1","2","20 October 2008"," One of a kind bio-pic, with great style
","Todd Haynes wrote and directed this very strange bio-pic of Bob Dylan, portrayed through various stages in his life and starring six different actors portraying Dylan in one way or another. The first time I watched this, I didn't know quite what to think, but I absolutely loved the Dylan soundtrack to the movie, that alone made it memorable. Next time through I listened to the very excellent commentary by Haynes, and everything seemed to work pretty well, after understanding what he was doing. This is a must-have for fans of Bob Dylan, but really, fans of Bob Dylan as myself, might not even get everything this movie throws at the viewer initially. The standout performance is Cate Blanchett as Jude, who is Dylan during his years when he went electric and his memorable British tour. Others filling parts of Dylans early life in the sixties and seventies, Christian Bale, Heath Ledger, Ben Whishaw, Richard Gere, and the young Marcus Carl Franklin. The movie is actually several stories all woven together with Dylan's music always playing, which is infectious to say the least. Very interesting and a one of a kind of movie that if you aren't all ready a fan, you'll be introduced to the amazing songwriting that makes Bob Dylan the premier songwriter of the 20 century by far. I can't think of anybody that even comes close. And the amazing soundtrack is on my Want List immediately."

"loganx-2","10","1","2","11 June 2008"," One Of The Best Films Of The Year
","Amazing, great performances, great script, great directing, great concept, I normally stay away from Biopics because they tend to either demonize or hero worship, especially when it comes to musicians. Tood Haynes uses fragmentation as a device to show us parts and aspects of a personality emphasizing that there is no one ""real"" person ever really present within anyone, just lots of idealizations, frailties, passions, dreams, fears, and projections, a series of persona. He demonstrates this by using six different actors(of various races, genders, and ages) to play various aspects of Bob Dylan's personality, career, and life.<br/><br/>The soundtrack which uses a lot of original Dylan songs as well as covers, adds to the confusion of identity. Now normally with a film of this scope, it's easy for it to become swallowed by it's own audacity, but ""Im Not There"" doesn't miss a beat. My favorite film of 07, and instantly one of my top ten all time favorites. About as smart, literate, and enjoyable as films get."
"vg_irreverence","10","1","2","5 February 2008"," Dylan still going strong in the XXI Century
","Being a Dylan fan I was eager to see the film when it first came out, however, because of one thing or another I only had the chance to see it during my lunch break today - a time of the day that I hate to see any film, let alone one about Mr Zimmerman (in my opinion leaving a cinema when its still daylight somehow manages to spoil even a very good film) anyway, what I'm trying to say is that even though it was very much daylight when I left the cinema that did not stop me enjoying it. It is very well acted by all and Dylan's story told in a very interesting manner. However, do not try to read much into the film - it is a commercial venture after all - as it does not tell anything new about the man. If you are a Dylan fan you already should know everything there is to know about him, if you are not, you probably will end up a little bit confused, however, I hope that at least it will make you just a little bit curious and hopefully you will start listening to his music. It is probably a good idea to do some research before you go to see the film as the way the story is told might confuse even those who think they know a lot about him. What we must not forget is that no matter what the critics or public say - Dylan will always be Dylan - the greatest poet of the XX Century and still going strong in the XXI Century. Like he states in the film ""I'm no folk singer! Everybody knows that!"" Enjoy the film for what it is and his music for the brilliancy of the lyrics. Not long ago he sang ""It's not dark yet, but it's getting there"" - it certainly is - but I hope he stays around for a few years more. Heroes usually die young but Dylan is living proof that by dying older the myth will live forever. What we must not forget is that, no matter how many films or documentaries are made about him, it is not the images that are important but the music ... or should I say the words!"
"mgens","10","1","2","28 January 2008"," perfect film, but not a bio-pic (and that's just fine...)
","A.O. Scott's review in the NY Times, while clearly worshipful of Dylan, appreciates Haynes' film exactly as it deserves. This is not a bio-pic of Dylan, nor is it a 50s/60s/70s travelogue. Some of my fellow readers here and elsewhere seem to miss this point: one wrote ""The film loses itself in its pieces and fails to draw them together into a whole picture by way of a stringent narrative."" Um... exactly. That might be the point about Dylan that the film is making. I do think, though, that the film as a film is brilliant, compelling, thoughtful, beautiful. Don't expect 'Walk the Line' (and I love Johnny more than I do Dylan, actually...) when what we're getting is something much, much finer in film-making: a work of art. This is a better tribute to Bob Dylan than a slavish recreation of a life, an assembled biography (nothing against biography!). In the world of art - as opposed to biography - it doesn't matter whether Dylan's first wife was an exotic playboy bunny or an exotic French painter. Tom Stoppard gives Oscar Wilde the following words in 'The Invention of Love': ""Art cannot be subordinate to its subject, otherwise it is not art but biography, and biography is the mesh through which our real life escapes. I was said to have walked down Piccadilly with a lily in my hand. There was no need. To do it is nothing, to be said to have done it is everything. It is the truth about me."" Dylan and Haynes both understand this, I think."
"ackstasis","8","1","2","24 January 2008"," ""I accept chaos. I don't know whether it accepts me.""
","Ask me a question about Bob Dylan. Whatever you just asked, I got it wrong, such is my knowledge of the man and his music. In preparation for Todd Haynes' latest film, a wildly unconventional ""biopic"" of the iconic singer-songwriter, I briefly listened to a few extant Dylan tracks on my computer, including ""Ballad of a Thin Man"" and ""Like A Rolling Stone,"" as if these few brief snippets could offer me any genuine insight into the man behind the music. Nevertheless, I entered the film almost completely blind, unfamiliar with both the artistry of Bob Dylan and director Todd Haynes {from whom this was my first film}. Daring, baffling, infuriating, unique, artistic, brilliant 'I'm Not There (2007)' is all of these things; a wonderful piece of cinema from a bold and challenging director. In an attempt to understand the many facets of Dylan's personality, music and legacy, the film takes the peculiar path of representing the singer through six different characters, portrayed by actors of differing age, race and, indeed, gender; each separate personality charts just one distinct aspect of his persona.<br/><br/>When I first heard that Cate Blanchett would be portraying one of the Dylan-based characters, I considered it nothing more than a publicity-minded gimmick. A gimmick it certainly is, but Blanchett, beyond all belief, makes it work flawlessly, swiftly disappearing into the guise of Jude Quinn, a 1960s version of Dylan at the height of his fame, at a time when much of his original fan-base was rejecting him as a ""sell-out""  most assuredly, a Best Supporting Actress win is in the bag at the approaching Academy Awards. The second finest performance, oddly enough, comes from young African-American actor Marcus Carl Franklin, who plays a talented eleven-year-old juvenile delinquent going by the name of Woody Guthrie {who, I was to discover, was one of Dylan's primary inspirations}. Also solid in their respective Dylan incarnations are Ben Whishaw, Richard Gere and Heath Ledger {the latter being rather difficult to watch considering his unfortunate death just one day earlier}. Christian Bale, a favourite actor of mine, is, regrettably, given very little to do. Though there's nothing inherently wrong with his performance, the ""mockumentary"" format of his segment allows very little room with which to display his talents.<br/><br/>What ultimately makes 'I'm Not There' such a delight, is that the film, quite deliberately, exists as a rather cluttered amalgamation of conflicting visual styles. The sequences with Franklin and Gere, for example, are exquisitely captured in vibrant colour, seeming to exist almost in a fantasy world. Ledger's scenes take place more-or-less in the real world, his character's family and marital problems unfolding amid dull surroundings and subdued colours. Bale's sequences, shot on 16mm colour stock, successfully evoke the feel of a typical biographical documentary, complete with an interview from former girlfriend Alice Fabian (Julianne Moore)  apparently representative of real-life folk singer Joan Baez, with whom Dylan had a well-publicised relationship. While Whishaw's brief Dylan sequences are captured with scratchy, grainy black-and-white film stock, Blanchett's segments are smooth and crisp. Steeped in surrealism, and very reminiscent of Federico Fellini's '8½ (1962),' the Jude Quinn sequences feature some of the film's most engrossing moments, particularly the brooding, fantastical performance of ""Ballad of a Thin Man"" {from the 1965 album, 'Highway 61 Revisited'}.<br/><br/>It goes without saying that a terrific soundtrack supplements the events on the screen, and, though perhaps running a few minutes too long, the film generally keeps a consistent pace. If Haynes' film is to be believed, then Bob Dylan was, and is, certainly an enigma, a personality whose motivations and inspirations may forever remain elusive. 'I'm Not There' certainly doesn't attempt to answer any of the begging questions about Dylan's life, and, indeed, through its convoluted narrative structure, Haynes seems to be contending that it's pointless to even try. Nevertheless, the film is a rewarding experience on many levels, the least of which being the pleasure of witnessing a motion picture unlike any other you're likely to see this year. If somebody like myself can admire and enjoy 'I'm Not There,' then this is proof that the film is certainly not just for Bob Dylan enthusiasts. However, if, like me, you didn't already know that the film's title was also the name of one of Dylan's unreleased tracks, then you might need to tread with caution."
"seeinblu","10","1","2","17 January 2008"," A Work Of Genius About A Man's Genius
","This was a remarkable and ground breaking film. I won't go into the theme and plot which have been expanded upon in detail in previous posts. Whether due to its layering of metaphor, complex multi-structure or literary gems throughout, the film left me with a visceral and inexpressive, yet profound understanding of what makes Mr. Dylan tick and subsequently myself. You see, Mr. Dylan wasn't there. In essence, Mr. Dylan's character (as brilliantly played by 6 different actors) was a mirror reflecting what is in all of us. The soundtrack, Dylan songs as covered by other musicians better emphasized how his words speak of a generally agreeable human experience and insight. Dylan's biography was a story of how his hard lined and self-imposed solo journey to self-actualization left me feeling, leave us all feeling, more self aware as human beings."
"MaxBorg89","9","1","2","15 January 2008"," He may not be there as a character, but Dylan's spirit permeates Todd Haynes' anti-biography
","Ray Charles? No problem at all. Johnny Cash? Ditto. Bob Dylan? Don't think so. For all his brilliance and deep influence on 20th-century culture, Dylan is so elusive and enigmatic an icon no one has ever tried to make a film about his life. Even Martin Scorsese, who delivered the ultimate tribute, the beautiful documentary No Direction Home, was wise enough to focus on what inspired Dylan rather than the man himself. So why would the great musician sanction Todd Haynes' experimental take on his life? The answer's very simple: he ain't really there.<br/><br/>The key to understanding I'm Not There is in the opening credits, where a caption declares the film is ""based on the music and many lives of Bob Dylan"". By having six protagonists, all of whom embody an aspect of the singer without actually being named after him, Haynes can cover whatever aspect of Dylan's persona he pleases without upsetting anyone. After all, the subject isn't even there.<br/><br/>So who is there? Well, there's a young African-American boy named Woody Guthrie (Marcus Carl Franklin) who travels around the South of the USA and is influenced by the people he runs into; there's Jack Rollins (Christian Bale), a 22-year old folk artist who is embracing early successes; Robbie Clark (Heath Ledger), an actor playing Rollins on screen who is watching his marriage fall apart; Jude Quinn (Cate Blanchett), who represents the so-called ""sell-out"" period in which Robert Zimmerman went commercial; Billy the Kid (Richard Gere), an outlaw living in an elegiac landscape and about to witness the end of his era; and the mysterious Arthur Rimbaud (Ben Whishaw), who is shown as he gets questioned at a trial and throws out the occasional piece of philosophy, speaking lines such as ""I accept chaos. I don't know whether it accepts me."".<br/><br/>Six different incarnations: they're all Dylan, and yet they aren't, which is probably the point. When an artist is that complex, the best thing to do is rejecting all thoughts of conventional storytelling: with no trace of chronology or even coherence between the different sections (minus the Bale-Ledger connection), Haynes' peculiar picture is more about mood, music and images than a traditional story. Fans of Sam Peckinpah, in particular, are likely to adore the Gere chapter, which explicitly references the Dylan-scored Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid (coincidentally, Peckinpah's Billy, Kris Kristofferson, is the narrator in this film). ""Knocking on Heaven's Door"", however, is not included.<br/><br/>With all the focus on style, one might think the cast if of secondary importance. That couldn't be further from the truth: from Franklin's passionate ""rookie"" to Whishaw's unsettling oddball, all six ""Dylans"" contribute to conveying the brilliant poet's secretive charisma. Most effective of all is Blanchett: not only is the physical resemblance faultless; her androgynous performance captures Dylan's contradictory charm better than all her co-stars put together, which is why she won the Best Actress award (or should it have been Actor?) in Venice, collected a Golden Globe and will, hopefully, get another Oscar, after her stunning effort in The Aviator.<br/><br/>Bottom line: the movie is very good-looking, wonderfully scored and boasts incredibly strong acting. But is it for everyone? Not really. Those who aren't particularly familiar with Dylan's work will struggle to understand what all the fuss is about, but if they hold on until the end they might be able to appreciate Haynes' creation: a free-wheeling, strangely gripping portrait of a genius. Despite the fact that he isn't actually in it."
"screenbeetle","7","1","2","10 January 2008"," Overall a good film but tried too hard to make its points
","To fans of Dylan, Todd Haynes has crafted a solid, watchable film with definite moments of brilliance. Cate Blanchett undoubtedly steals the show with a stunning character performance perfectly capturing Dylan's awkward arrogance during his 1965 UK tour. The style and arrangement of the scenes depicting Dylan's alter ego in the Blanchett and other periods of his life are also conceptually excellent. Haynes' use of subtly abstract visuals, fast paced editing and stylalised cinematography also nicely combine to illustrate and explore the symbolic meaning of Dylan's opinions and lyrics.<br/><br/>Unfortunately other aspects of the film only succeed in distracting from the films generally well constructed core themes. Most scenes do initially give very intelligent, snappy and sensitive insights into the stages of Dylan's life that are portrayed. The success of this style is, however, partially negated by Haynes' incessant need to repeatedly flash back to expand on the details. While this strategy works well in the Blanchett scenes it falls very short with some of the other characters, making the film feel very labored at times. Further compounding this, one has the feeling that Haynes' overindulgence on Dylan fact and symbolism renders the film somewhat esoteric to none but the most ardent fans.<br/><br/>All things considered, 'I'm Not There' does stand as a definite must for Dylan fans. The Blanchett performance alone is enough to carry the film and will certainly be a pleasure for fans and non-fans alike. Musically too the Dylan originals and covers can't help but make for a highly enjoyable experience. Tod Heynes however, while a competent and thorough directer, cannot yet be considered in the top flight of alternative or biopic film makers."
"LoneWolfAndCub","10","1","2","10 January 2008"," A fascinating way to portray one of the greatest (and most complex) musicians to ever have existed
","Most people would have heard about this biopic and it's unique way of approaching it's subject matter. Basically, this movie is about Bob Dylan but it isn't that simple. What Todd Haynes does is split his personality and life into 6 different people (of different age, race and sex) and tell the story through them. I squealed with delight when hearing about this as I love Bob Dylan, I loved the different approach Haynes was making and the actors he chose were all odd but excellent choices.<br/><br/>Marcus Carl Franklin is Woody Guthrie (not the actual singer), a travelling kid with a huge talent for music but who is not exactly an honest, straight-forward person. He represents the early shape-shifting Dylan in search of an identity and telling a lot of lies along the way.<br/><br/>Ben Whishaw is Arthur Rimbaud, a 19 year old who hasn't really got a story but who we know is a poet. He's the young, ironic, questioning Dylan.<br/><br/>Christian Bale is Jack Rollins, the high-profile ""political"" Dylan who spearheaded a movement and became famous with his brilliant early LP's. Heath Ledger is Robbie Clark, the personal life of Dylan. Family troubles, paparazzi troubles and a big ego.<br/><br/>Cate Blanchett is Jude Quinn, the Dylan that shocked everyone by going to electric guitar. Finally, Richard Gere is Billy the Kid, the outlaw Dylan.<br/><br/>These six actors all portray different parts of Dylan (although I think Bale was underused) but all are equally amazing. Of particular note is Blanchett, Franklin and Ledger who all give very strong, powerful performances. Haynes direction and style is unique to say the least, with some stories in black and white, some in colour and all with their little oddities that make them all different. The soundtrack is enough to please any Bob Dylan fan and the movie will leave you thinking much deeper than one might expect.<br/><br/>Not only is it a biopic, but an abstract look at art, politics, the 60's and 70's and the hard times some artists face in turning points of their career.<br/><br/>5/5"
"isabelle1955","Null","1","2","31 December 2007"," Interesting Attempt at Something Different
","This is an interesting film and a brave attempt at something different and I have to admire it for that. Whether it really works, well, I'm not sure. I thought it too long and occasionally a bit lacking in narrative direction (I looked at my watch about 15 minutes from the end, which is not a good sign), and it would have benefited greatly from more ruthless editing. Nonetheless, I think it is praiseworthy.<br/><br/>Director Todd Haynes has attempted to show the various aspects of Dylan's complex persona by using different actors to portray him as different people at different stages of his life and development as an artist. Some of these personas work better than others. At the risk of repeating what everyone else has already said, Cate Blanchett is astonishing. The movie is certainly worth watching just to see Blanchett. She has an uncanny physical resemblance to Dylan and has his mannerisms to a T. She portrays Dylan as he evolves from adored folk star to reviled rock star, dealing with a world which wants him to say something profound, when all he really wants to do is play his guitar and sing. The world wanted a messiah. Dylan apparently wanted a house in the country and lots of women, much like many other rock stars.<br/><br/>I also loved Marcus Carl Franklin as Woody Guthrie Dylan. I think we are going to see much, much more of Franklin in the future, he is obviously a great talent. The first Christian Bale character works, and Heath Ledger is pretty believable as Straying Husband Dylan. But I was bemused by the Billy the Kid character as portrayed by Richard Gere, and pretty indifferent to Ben Whishaw / Arthur Rimbaud. For me, those didn't work so well.<br/><br/>I'm Not There is probably best viewed after watching Martin Scorsese's No Direction Home and I have to be honest and admit I much preferred the Scorsese documentary to the Todd Haynes film. But this was a very creative approach to movie making, and for that reason, well worth watching. Cate Blanchett will probably get another nomination for this role."

This is an interesting character with an ironical twist on the revered cliché of knowing yourself and being true to who you are. What he was and what he was true to, was a man of no standard who did his own thing. His chaos and lack of knowledge of himself was his individuality.

With a cast of characters that spans age, race and a multitude of eras, this is the closest I think we are going to get to knowing the real Bob Dylan...as if there really is one. Despite Dylan's notoriously impenetrable mantle, Haynes does a great job. He gives us a glimpse, let's us take a peek through the keyhole as it were.<br/><br/>And as excited as I was to see the film, I was equally excited to learn that Dylan (or a character closely resembling him) is the subject of another equally innovative treatment of what fame does to the artist; and what we the artist is able to do to us. The book is a murder-mystery called BLOOD ON THE TRACKS, and it's written by Los Angeles screenwriter Tom Grasty. And while Grasty's portrayal doesn't attempt to deconstruct the Dylan mythology as much as the Haynes film, it does put an enigmatic rock legend at its center. But if you look close enough you can see the imprint of Dylan throughout.<br/><br/>Which brings us back to ""I'm Not There."" The fact that so many attempts have been made over the years to pin Bob Dylan down is a testament to the grip Dylan has on our collective cultural psyche. Or psyches as the case is with this film since there are several different 'Dylans' here...yet Dylan's not there at all. As I said, it's an amazing glimpse at a man who frankly I'm amazed let Haynes take a look at all.<br/><br/>But then again, I'm sure Dylan didn't tell Haynes anything he didn't want the rest of is to know."
"mlevens1","7","2","7","6 December 2007"," It's a decent film
","This was smartly written and acted with supreme dedication. This is not some artsy-fartsy junk; this is a complicated and tightly woven production.<br/><br/>It's not a hagiography of Bob Dylan or his music - this movie is better than that. Dylan is seen through the lives of 6 (or 7) characters, each to represent something in Dylan realistically. Every character has faults and very few characters are completely likable.<br/><br/>Cate Blanchett will receive acclaim for her role as ""Jude Quinn"". Apart from the fact that she really looks like Dylan, her performance was wonderful. It's a very complicated role, but she pulled it off. It's an Oscar-worthy performance.<br/><br/>Heath Ledger's ""Robbie Clark"" was also very well done. (Though his character seems more based on James Dean than it is on Bob Dylan.) I found his portrayal to be the most honest and authentic of the movie. A whole feature could be made simply on Ledger's character and the dissolving of his marriage.<br/><br/>Unfortunately many of the other characters and story lines don't work or are simply confusing. This makes the film longer than it has to be, and not as good as it should be.<br/><br/>The picture was directed and co-written by Todd Haynes. He was Oscar-nominated for writing FAR FROM HEAVEN (2002), which is a stunning character study about social mores in 1950s suburbia.<br/><br/>Co-writing with Haynes was Oren Moverman, who has only written two features before this."

","It wasn't straight forward. It reminded me of I Shot Andy Warhol"". It had some of the same scene shots as ""Don't Look Back"" (a Dylan movie from '65) and used some very grand shots, people dressed up in costume way over the top, very much like a Fellini movie ( I think on purpose, he mentions Fellini in one song). A lot of the movie was deliberate in drawing from Dylan's own songs which seemed to drive the narrative. It gives the audience a lot of credit to be able to pick these things out. It was funny in parts without explaining why. But it did leave some people lost - which I overheard with conversations coming out of the theater. For example, I don't know how many people got that Dylan and his band pulled out machine guns on stage and shot at the crowd while they were showing the scene of Dylan plugging in his electric guitar...and the motorcycle crash he had in 68. They breezed through that in a funny way. A far off shot of a bike starting up, driving across the screen left to right, and a cheesy sound effect of a crash. Also, quickly did a shot with ""A Hard Day's Night"" when the Beatles run into the movie as he is filming this one. Very funny."

","This movie is great, it puts Dylans life into stages played by very good actors to paint a picture of how diverse Dylan is. His 1st stage of Woody is a look at the hoboing/playing to eat days. Jack is his protest singing period of fame. Ben is his artist phase when he stopped singing protest songs and had a lot of interviews when he wouldn't give strait answers. Jude is his electric drug driven stage that was ended by the motorcycle crash. Billy is his cowboy music phase with John Wesely Harding and Billy the Kidd albums telling of the west. Heath is when Bob's fame from music and movies starts to end his marriage. John is his conversion to Christianity. Very good way to show the many persons in Dylan."
"clearbluesky-2","10","2","7","22 November 2007"," One of the most amazing editing ever
","It seems that Todd Haynes took a long time to make this movie. After having seen it 3 times in the last couple of months, I can understand why. Since the music must have been the whole focus of it since the beginning and of course the movie being not a musical, the only way to connect such a complex array of stories was to resort to silent movies style of editing. And how it did succeed. Were Eisenstein still alive, he would be crying tears of joy, after watching I'm Not There. Some scenes are a perfect display of intellectual montage. In particular the first and the last one featuring Heath Ledger and Charlotte Gainsbourg, with pictures of Venus statues and of the Mona Lisa painting representing the dialectal relationship between art and beauty, then with images of Kissinger signing the peace treaty with the Vietnamese representing the result of the agreement that Claire delivers to Robbie. The music is never there just as an embellishment, only to make a nice soundtrack to buy and play. It always interacts with the frames. A couple of moment really struck me: 'Blind Willie McTell' on the scene where the kid visits a dying Guthrie, just as to connect two founding fathers of Dylan's inspiration and the sequence when Billy/Richard Gere asks to a family where are they going and the picture freezes while the song on the background screams 'to the valley below'. The heterogeneity of the materials used is just amazing, from real archive footage to stills of pictures reminding of real Dylanesque material (LP covers with Jack/Christian Bale instead of Bob), from grainy small format films taken with a hand camera to careful tracking shots in black and white showing a stratified field depth. And a tracking shot, probably the longest one in the movie, is also the moment in which a big hint to the real nature of the singer is presented: when Jude/Cate Blanchett follows Coco showing his nakedness and naivety in relating with women (how daring from a woman playing a male character). Most of this movie is already an instant classic: expect very soon to see quoted sequences like the one in which Keenan Jones (Bruce Greenwood) is exposed to the fact that he is the 'thin man' of the ballad. Maybe not an easy movie to follow the first time, but it will gratify enormously anyone who has the patience of trying the catch its essence, frame after frame. After all, nothing is linear in the life of a man who has been living a hundred times in a single lifespan."

","Todd Haynes has delivered his best film to date about the multiple facets of living legend musician, poet, and writer, Bob Dylan. While Dylan has been awarded the Kennedy Center Honors, this film is quite a tribute to the man's legacy and his role forever in the world and not just America. For most of us, Bob Dylan is a songwriter and musician but also philosopher, poet, and activist. His music inspired people and still does. The film is a mixture of six characters including an African American child Marcus Carl Franklin who played Woody in the 1950s. There is Cate Blanchett's well-deserved Oscar nomination for supporting actress as Jude Quinn in the mid-60s in England where the song, ""Mr. Jones,"" comes into play. Bruce Greenwood played the inspirational role of a British television journalist. There is Richard Gere in the 1800s small town with his dog, Henry. There is Ben Whishaw who is not used enough in the film. Of course, the late Heath Ledger played a significant role opposite French actress, Charlotte Gainsbourg. Michelle Williams played Coco, an actress, as well. This film is perfect casting. The writing might need more tweaking and the ending was confusing but the originality is what I'll take away from it. This film is a perfect tribute to Bob Dylan."

","Having grown up on the folkie Dylan and in fact growing from not caring for his music to a bold admiration for many of his early tunes, I was disappointed with this fictional piece of cinema.<br/><br/>Dylan comes through as many people, but hardly the ones conjured up here. At some points his stomping and thin build remind more of Jagger than Woody Guthrie. The dark glasses and gimmicks, remind of Michael Jackson. The interviews where only double talk and gibberish are uttered, make one believe Dylan is a pot head, not a guru.<br/><br/>So where is the real Bob Dylan? Can we honestly say Dylan really cared about the down trodden? If so there is virtually no interview where he can be so associated. One is left rather with the impression Dyaln is a ghost. Indeed, a man of constant contradictions within himself. And much of his poetry he admitted was gibberish, a abstract for write in your own impressions.<br/><br/>Still many performances here were delightful, especially Marcus Fanklin's as 13 year old Woody Guthrie, aka Dylan on the road. Of course, it was all fiction! Dylan is a media created folk legend just as Oprah is an media hyped guru. Neither of them are really THERE.<br/><br/>The most memorable line, someone accuses Dylan of being a "" c**k sucker"", to which he replies, ""Ain't what is in a man's mouth, it's what comes out of it."" LOL"

","I know a bit about Dylan, and I understand why people who don't would not get as much out of this, especially the born-again stuff and Richard Gere's extended riff on ""Renaldo & Clara"". And maybe it's just my own preoccupations, but I find that this is most engaging when it's dealing with the clash between celebrity 'protest' culture and personal artistic vision - which mainly means whenever the brilliant Cate Blanchett is on screen. She REALLY has a field day with the man in his undeniable prime. All seven Dylans do the job though, and the stylistics mostly enhance rather than confuse - I love the Beatles and Ginsburg cameos and anything taking place on a freight train. The stuff involving his 'wife' tends to lose me a little though, and when the 60s snapshot montages descend, look out Time-Life Video. I do like the balanced and critical take Haynes has on Dylan's self-centered myth-making, taking stock of both the pleasures and the falsehoods - sometimes the pleasures ARE falsehoods."

There hasn't been any attempt to form a symmetry, not in the acting and not in the plot concept. This is confusing on purpose.<br/><br/>But you can only surrender, most of all to Cate Blanchett's performance, which is from another dimension. She's almost frightening, taking the whole of Dylan's middle-60s-complexity into light, making you think you watch a documentary.<br/><br/>If you ever thought you will get any grip at all about who Bob Dylan is, this film cures you.

","Maudlin, Gothic, hysterical, thrilled to be here, and not really here at all, this is my favorite movie of 2007. This is art on fire, consuming itself, burning off its veneer of postmodern chagrin to pour heat on a shivering body politic. Who needs sense, though this movie makes more sense than any ten Will Smith vehicles. What means truth, though this movie's got more truth than any fifty Joel Schumacher projects. Genius actors Blanchett and Cross, playing genius poets Dylan and Ginsberg, calling up to a crucified Jesus to ""do your early stuff"" or else ""you could get yourself killed""...well, what can be said about it? It transcends commentary, genre, venue, medium, taste. This movie is rock and roll. Play it loud.<br/><br/>Beyond the strictures of biography, approbation, paean, odyssey, it just keeps giving. Charlotte Gainsbourg: thank you. Richie Havens: thank you. This is what Bale oughtta be doing, not retread superheroes but real live human beings; this is what Gere can do, not just another PRETTY WOMAN clone but a real character in a real original. Cate Blanchett once again flawlessly executes what seemingly no one else in the world could be expected to pull off. Bruce Greenwood is always good, but how often is he great? Marcus Carl Franklin is better than any little kid has a right to be. Ben Whishaw is sharp and stark in the limited arena he is allowed. And how odd is it now to watch the currently dead Heath Ledger playing a movie star older than he ever got, full of regret, choked by loss, embittered by the success that gave and took everything he had?<br/><br/>Todd Haynes scares me. He's so often so painfully good - SUPERSTAR, SAFE, I'M NOT THERE - that he makes it possible to contemplate honest mistakes like POISON and FAR FROM HEAVEN with feelings of mellow condescension and still realize you're looking at a big, fat king of the road. This guy can do anything. I want to see everything he does no matter how bad or good because this, my friends, is a man with something to say and saying it in as many voices as he cares to articulate. He shouts, he whispers, he hisses in your ear, he breaks bottles with his teeth and spits splinters of glass into your eyes. I am glad to be awake today, because I managed not to sleep through this delirious spectacle. <br/><br/>There's a sequence in I'M NOT THERE that takes place in Stockton, California, when Dylan loses his mind and finds religion in the sticks. Well, you can take it from me and anyone else who ever lived there with his eyes open that Stockton is exactly the right place for a brilliant light to go out for awhile. Leave it to Haynes to find such a place, and to use it for all (more than?) it's worth."

","Biopic: the word makes me shudder. I guess it makes Todd Haynes do something similar, or otherwise he wouldn't have come up with this fascinating movie inspired by the life and work of Bob Dylan. Essentially a film-maker's imaginative response to the man and the songs, it is something of a cinematic equivalent to Don Maclean's song American Pie, in which a whole era is celebrated and lamented in a lyrical, sometimes densely coded, piece of writing. Whether I'm Not There will last as long as American Pie (the song, not the movie of the same name!) only time will tell. But I'm pretty sure that when cultural historians look back and view the usual sentimental dross claiming to document the life of this or that artist, I'm Not There will shine out, a beacon in a dark sea of mediocrity. While it is true that not all of this film works, most of it is beautiful and absorbing and, in the case of Cate Blanchett, dazzling.<br/><br/>As well as the excellent sextet of Dylans, there's poignant support from Charlotte Gainsbourgh, and contrastingly from Bruce Greenwood giving another of his splendid vipers.<br/><br/>All power to Todd Haynes. The man, like his subject, is a poet."

","I'm Not There is basically a two-hour long experimental film with uniformly excellent acting and production values. Todd Haynes' deconstruction of the writings of Bob Dylan was always interesting.<br/><br/>But the movie doesn't just deconstruct Dylan; it takes a pretty good whack at American and British culture from the late '50s through the mid '70s, particularly the mod scene in London in the mid-'60s.<br/><br/>Cate Blanchett is the best Dylan of the bunch, as the icon who turns the singer electric and leads him into a drug-filled time in London. She looked and talked more like Dylan than anyone else. Michelle Williams did a great turn as an Edie Sedgewick-esquire model named Coco. It was a pleasure to see Richie Havens in a small role as a guitar player early in the movie.<br/><br/>While this is not a literal biography of Dylan in any sense of the word, the movie uses his music and attitude very well.

Film Festivals and academies will also be taken in by its pseudo academia and won't see the forest from the trees! Haynes also gives a nod to his own gender bending by casting a woman to play one of the many characters who make up the supposed Dylan interpretations. Here we have Blanchet camping it up to please the critics and 'certain' types of fans, etc. If this convoluted work is an homage to Dylan, then it's an unflattering one, if it's true to Dylan's personal attitudes then it shows him to be little more than a commercially marketed product. <br/><br/>His latter conversion to Christianity and leaving his old persona behind is presented in a very bland way indeed - probably reflecting Haynes thoughts on the matter (in fact this whole exercise could be more about Haynes than Bob?). The Richard Gere cowboy character seems to be from another story altogether and largely offers only symbolic connection to Dylan - this is probably the most interesting as well as the least successful of the piece.

"classicsoncall","8","0","1","6 July 2011"," ""My only real plan is to become a singer...""
","On May 30th of this year, pollster Scott Rasmussen conducted a national telephone survey on Bob Dylan, and thirty seven percent of the respondents stated they didn't know enough about him to voice any kind of opinion at all. If I had to guess, that roughly one in three who doesn't know Dylan is only going to grow, and I say that with no disrespect or put down of his music. It's just that time goes by and people move on to other things, and Dylan isn't very topical today, considering how ubiquitous his voice was during the turbulent era of the Sixties.<br/><br/>Fortunately, I've seen the documentary ""No Direction Home"", and was able to draw enough parallels between that film and this biopic to have a hint of what was going on. Otherwise, one could easily get lost among the character switches that comprise the story, seeing as how the players are so disparate and seemingly unconnected. My favorites were Cate Blanchett as your basic Dylan, and young Marcus Carl Franklin who traces the singer back to his early blues roots. What I found frustrating though, is that in his attempts to defy classification, Dylan goes to the extreme of a Bill Clinton who once got hung up on what the definition of 'is' is. But I think the frustration went both ways. In ""No Direction Home"", Dylan tries to answer a reporter about the meaning of an album cover, when all it was to him was his picture on an album cover. For Dylan, it didn't have to get more complicated than that.<br/><br/>This film won't be for everyone, but I found it entertaining enough to give it a whirl again some time down the road. For your musical tastes, there's only a brief sampling of the early stuff that gained him his reputation, but I found it all to be a nice mix that didn't overwhelm the picture.<br/><br/>What I found odd however was a statement following the closing credits that you had to hang around for until the very end. There in black and white, it said ""This motion picture is fictional, but certain characters and actions have been inspired by real people and real events"". Seeing as how Dylan wasn't mentioned by name even once, that statement seemed to offer the film maker cover for any artistic stretches provided by the story. I've never seen or heard a response by Dylan to the film, so I have to wonder what he thinks, or if he was even there."

Six different actors portray Dylan at different times in his life all the while trying to figure out exactly what kind of man he really was. Cate Blanchett gives the film's best performance as the most interesting aspect of Dylan's life, when he was touring in England and recording Blonde on Blonde in 1965-66. Heath Ledger, Christian Bale, Marcus Carl Franklin, Ben Whishaw, and Richard Gere all give solid performances as the other identities Dylan passed through.<br/><br/>Still, what keeps this story moving and fascinating is the man himself, Bob Dylan, who was a folk-singer, rock n' roll rebel, distant country singer and mesmerizing enigma all rolled into one. Haynes does a good job of constantly moving back and forth between each character, although the Richard Gere sequence is the least interesting and goes a little too long. Still, for anyone who has ever been interested in Bob Dylan, this is a must-see as well as a very interesting and insightful interpretation of the icon as well as the man."

","I am only a few years younger than Bob Dylan. I was a person of the 60s and immersed in the 1960s music scene. But I was not a fad listener, I liked what I liked, and made no apologies. I liked some of the Beatles, but not everything they did. I liked a little of what Dylan did, but overall I was not a fan of Bob Dylan's recordings. I don't even consider him a singer, but more of a musical poet. Until I read his biography this morning, I didn't even know if he was still alive.<br/><br/>This movie borrows its title from one of Dylan's compositions, the last stanza being:<br/><br/>""Of course I'll not deceive her I'm not there, I'm gone It's all about confusion and I cry for her""<br/><br/>The ambiguity of these lyrics mirror the ambiguity of Bob Dylan's life. He was born and raised as a Jew, but later proclaimed to be a born-again Christian. He wrote politically-charged songs but until currently refused to endorse any politician. The Dylan of the 60s was different from the Dylan of the 70s, and so on through the years.<br/><br/>For these reasons this movie was done with several different actors playing fictional characters with different names as the Dylan surrogates, reasoning that since the real Dylan is continually changing, one actor could not play him over his career. <br/><br/>The movie works, and my favorite was Cate Blanchette as one of the Dylans.

And so it is with his portrait of Bob Dylan in his various phases of his life and music with countless actors playing him using different names each time. Of them, Cate Blanchett probably plays the most familiar one during Dylan's ""electric"" period when audiences were booing him for changing his style from pure folk to rock and admirers like poet Allen Ginsberg (a spot-on performance by David Cross) hung around. Richard Gere represents the more fictional aspect of him during the time he played in Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid and seemed to channel the period as through a revisionist western. And then there's Heath Ledger playing him during the singer's domestic life and his arguments with his wife and her female friend about women's lib. Nothing really connects here until the climax at the end and when it's all over, you'll either really be relieved at such and want to go on to something else or want to watch it all over again and explore other things Dylan.

The actors were unconvincing, playing too much cockiness and arrogance rather then the self confidence that all talent exurbs. It was hard to tell who and what do they represent.

Photography and direction are wonderful, the powerful images in sublime colors are so much what contemporary movies with 'stylish' subdued photography lack. At one point I was beginning to think that this movie could just go on forever, again and again switching from one character to another and showing small but meaningful incidents in their life. Acting is wonderful overall, and I especially liked the actor playing James Baldwin - yes, it was a silent extra part that isn't even credited here, but the actor still was performing - marvelous. The character of Michelle Williams seems to be a mix-up of Nico and Edie Sedgewick, which was great, since the song ""I'll Keep It With Mine"", which Bob Dylan wrote for Nico, could be heard in the movie, too.<br/><br/>The episode starring Richard Gere is the most fantastic and also features surreal masquerade, but I liked the episode starring Heath Ledger best, because the real man and artist began so much to shine through in his performance and it all had a somewhat foreboding and farewell-saying character.

A cast list that drew bated breaths is also one that complements Haynes's dauntless reach beyond the boundaries of narratives, performances and subject. His portrait of Dylan, is an interwoven collage of inhabited incarnations that not only pays tribute to a singular artist's personal and social identities, but to the many instances of creative process and its resulting capricious chaos that have left its slippery mark in our minds and as such, is as much about Todd Haynes as it is about Bob Dylan. With droll narrative swagger reminiscent of Todd Solondz's equally mind-bending ""Palindromes"", where multiple actors play a single character through different forms and times, Haynes gleefully glides through the eras, remarking on the cults of celebrity that have defined them and the fantasia we prefer to remember."

","There are already 170 comments here... there is nothing that I can say that is original.... I just saw the film and I sat in awe, provoked intellectually and philosophically and moved once again by his music as I heard it in my youth. For those lived life along the same time frame of Dylan, so many of the images in the movie must have evoked for them photographic images of Dylan either pensive or in motion. I had not realized how iconic those image now are as part of our culture. I also realized that I never, when I was younger (I am a few years younger than Dylan) understood the import of what he was saying... perhaps he didn't either ... he was so young when he said them and it may have been most intuitive. But Todd Haynes' movie shows how Dylan's comments and reactions pushed the philosophical edge of perspective on living onto another plane challenging everybody to ponder as he pondered himself.<br/><br/>When I walked into the theater -- the local theater for the artsy crowd, the ticket taker, a young man in his late 20's or so.. said what a great film it was -- in particular how awesome Heath Ledger was in it. Heath ledger has just passed away a few weeks before this comment. Honestly I did not think he had as great an impact as Cate Blanchett who was truly remarkable -- and has deservedly been nominated for best supporting Actress for the Academy awards. She had the most and most powerful screen time and I was curious as to why she went for best supporting actress. It probably was strategic, increasing her chances of winning in a year of a large number of great films. But upon reflection, I realized that the star of the movie was Dylan himself who though not present physically in the film is present in forceful spirit throughout the film."
