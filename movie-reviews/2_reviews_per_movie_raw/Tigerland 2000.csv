"mbbilbo","9","38","42","29 July 2007"," Fairly authentic and very much like Fort Polk in the early 70s.
","While it was filmed at a Florida National Guard site, ""Tigerland"" totally reminded me of Fort Polk, LA., firing ranges, maneuver areas, waist-deep water and all. The movie was fairly authentic and the characters similar to those same ones at my AIT in 1974. The difference between the Tigerland year, 1971, and mine of 1974 is all the drill sergeants and instructors knew they weren't going back to Vietnam, as it was pretty much all over, so training was very relaxed - not a challenge at all. That was the precursor to all our troubles in the 70s and 80s, which I know for a fact as I stayed in until 2004. I never heard anyone mention ""Tigerland"" but the Army did have realistic Vietnam training villages at different bases across the U.S. Vietnam Vets tell me that up to 1972 Basic & AIT could be pretty rough and rugged, because the trainers had been there and were mandated to train Vietnam-bound men those skills to make it, although that was not always the case. Both a drill sergeant at Polk and later one of my Vietnam Vet NCOs, when we had become instructors at a basic training brigade at Fort Bliss, told me there was nothing they could do to get anyone ready and people just had to find out and figure out for themselves. This movie rates high."

","American military authority is the enemy for Pvt. Roland Bozz (Colin Farrell), a nonconformist trainee who, along with other infantry trainees, endures brutal, sadistic treatment in preparation for combat in Vietnam. Tigerland is a swampy, steamy camp near Fort Polk, Louisiana that is supposed to simulate conditions in Vietnam. The story is set in 1971.<br/><br/>The amount and severity of physical and verbal aggression displayed in this film may be a tad overstated. But the point the film is making is that many, if not most, of the young guys drafted into the army in the late 60s and early 70s absolutely did not want, or deserve, to be there.<br/><br/>Roland Bozz is one of those young men. He's angry at the war, angry at the army. The army won't release him because they know that's what he wants. If Bozz can't get himself out, the next best thing is to try and get other recruits out. That will be his revenge, his way to fight the system.<br/><br/>A fellow trainee shares his background with Bozz, who then tells the trainee: ""I know army regulations the way prisoners know the law. You're a hardship discharge, man, if ever I saw one. Okay. I'll get you out of the army"". Bravo for Roland Bozz, a young rebel with a mission, a cause, trapped like the others by an oppressive, controlling institution.<br/><br/>Acting is very, very good. Colin Farrell is terrific, at a time when he, and the rest of the cast, was largely unknown. No need for overpaid A-list actors. The film's acting style trends naturalistic, spontaneous, and emotionally intense. None of the acting seems forced.<br/><br/>With a hand-held camera, combined with grainy film stock, and using quick zooms and unexpected cuts, the cinematography and editing convey a documentary look and feel, which results in sequences that are quite realistic. Lighting is mostly natural. Sets are plain and unadorned. Background music is minimal.<br/><br/>Much better than I ever expected, ""Tigerland"" is a well-made film with an intense, anti-war theme. It's about putting others ahead of one's own selfish interest. That Hollywood largely shunned this low-budget film is all the more reason to see it."

","Tiger Land is a tough training camp for the US military.  In 1971 it is the final step before the squads go to the war in Vietnam.  In training before Tiger Land, one squad of young men is joined by troublemaker Roland Bozz, who continues his military trend of dissention and insubordination. However, his actions do not just affect him and he starts to change his ways slightly, but the stresses and the potential for death in Vietnam push all the men to breaking point.<br/><br/>Sold as a war movie, this film is more like the first half of Full Metal Jacket than a full on war movie set in a combat zone.  As such it plays more like a drama than any sort of antiwar movie or outright thriller.  The focus of the film is the character of Bozz as told from the biographical point of view of Paxton.  The events of the film are pretty predictable for anyone who has seen this type of film before - the internal fights, the crazy soldiers, the domineering sergeant majors etc.  However it still manages to be enjoyable and entertaining even if it never really feels original or new. It is a pretty nondescript film with no specific edge on it - and that is part of the reason I think it really didn't do that good business when it was released here in the UK.  It relies very heavily on the characters to keep the audience involved in the story and preventing it being seen as just a collection of old ideas; this aspect is helped by the fact that it is drawing on original material, experiences and people.<br/><br/>A much bigger part of the characters being engaging is the playing of them by the cast.  Farrell is the lead actor and is miles ahead of everyone else. This film is one of many that made him the star he now is, and he does deserve it off the back of this and he is really good here - coming across as likeable and difficult.  Outside of him, everyone plays well but are generally in their various stereotypes; aside from Farrell, Collins is the standout role - too often seen playing gang bangers and such on TV cops shows, he delivers a solid character and presents a believable breakdown over the course of the film.<br/><br/>Keeping my habit of never paying to see an Schumacher film since Batman & Robin took the last faith in his talent, I waited for this to come onto TV. I was surprised however to see that Schumacher managed to do the film without spoiling it - in fact he came across as rather able!  He uses mainly handheld cameras and delivers a gritty feel to the whole film that is fitting to the material.  I hate to admit it, but he actually did a reasonable job here and he has now done a couple of films that he hasn't ruined in one way or another!  I may have to change my mind about not paying for his films - well, maybe not.<br/><br/>Overall this is a rather undistinguished film but one that is enjoyable as a character driven drama, trading on the usual clichés of the genre.  It goes where you more or less expect it to but it goes there and takes you with it. Farrell makes a good leading man and on this evidence he is worthy of leading man status where he has good support."

","TIGERLAND <br/><br/>Aspect ratio: 1.85:1<br/><br/>Sound format: Dolby Digital<br/><br/>Louisiana, 1971: During basic training, a rebellious army conscript (Colin Farrell) causes dissension within the ranks.<br/><br/>Given Joel Schumacher's reputation as a schlockmeister par excellence, most critics were caught off-guard by this low-budget drama, filmed without any of the frills and fripperies normally associated with Hollywood blockbusters, and headlined by little more than obscure (but hugely experienced) character actors and talented newcomers, including Farrell, whose bravura performance launched him to international stardom. Far removed from the extravagant Vietnam-operas favored by Francis Ford Coppola and Oliver Stone, Schumacher's film examines the contradictions of war and the dehumanizing effect of combat on ordinary men through the experiences of Farrell's anti-hero, a compassionate man who despises the self-serving patriotic nonsense peddled by his superiors, and who refuses to compromise his own ideals, despite the sometimes painful repercussions of his disobedience.<br/><br/>Though backed by a major studio, TIGERLAND has the look and feel of a low-budget indie production, using hand-held camera-work and grainy film-stock for documentary effect, and this uncompromising 'Dogme'-like approach allows Schumacher to focus his attention on the characters and their situation rather than the pyrotechnics which usually dominate such movies. Farrell may be the star of the show, but he's matched by debut actor Matthew Davis (BLOODRAYNE) as his closest friend and fellow combatant, an aspiring writer who volunteered for duty and who favors intellect and reason over Farrell's reckless bravado. Fine supporting cast, excellent technical credits."

","I had an uncle who committed suicide after serving in Vietnam because of mental problems he experienced after coming back. So when I saw part of this movie one night on a pay-for-view channel I was intrigued. I wanted to know what my uncle went through and felt as he got ready for Vietnam. I went out and rented this movie and I have to say it is the most heart-wrenching film I have ever seen. I bought the DVD immediately after renting it. The way it pulls you in so many different directions emotionally is something I've never experienced with any other film. As far as Vietnam subject films go, I think it is the best one, although Platoon runs a close second. Besides all of that, I think it is also Colin Farrell's best performance as an actor. I like him in most of his movies but in this one he was incredible. I gave this a 10 rating because it is one of my top five favorite movies."

Set circa 1971 Louisiana in a special Army training camp for new recruits prior to shipment in the ongoing war and told in flashback by one of the survivors the film centers its bare bones plot around the able shoulders of Irish newcomer Farrell in a potential star-making turn as Private Roland Bozz (think 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' in fatigues and you get the overall impression), a feckless troublemaker of his platoon whose antics have a method to his madness: keeping yourself alive despite the odds. Raw and uncompromising are best suited to describe the film's gist and in particular its focus of Bozz leading his comrades in arms through their hellish grunt duty prior to their fated dooms.

"Movie-12","8","21","33","31 January 2001"," Another risky movie from Joel Schumacher; good technical qualities and great acting. ***1/2 (out of four)
","TIGERLAND / (2000) ***1/2 (out of four)<br/><br/>By Blake French:<br/><br/>	Throughout the years audiences have seen and understood war films with every point of view possible, and somehow producers and writers always come up with new and innovative methods of portraying various soldiers on the battlefield. Joel Schumacher (""8MM,"" ""A Time to Kill""), easily one of the riskiest directors currently working, has found resemblance with ""The Thin Red Line"" in the way his new drama ""Tigerland"" steps in an individual soldier's shoes. This movie, written by Ross Klavan and Michael McGuther, has more guts and irony than ""The Thin Red Line"" or even ""Saving Private Ryan."" Although the movie's dramatic impact is somewhat lessened due to the perversity of the material present, it certainly enlightens us on a new perspective of young men training for war. <br/><br/>	I would want to know Joel Schumacher's experiences with the army. Are the men really this unabashed and brutal? I am sure some of them are, but the movie views its uncompromising world through the eyes of a young man named Roland Bozz (Colin Farrell), who is rebellious against the ideas of war. His personality instantly counteracts with several other characters, one who becomes his best friend, Paxton (Matthew Davis), and another, Wilson (Russell Richardson), whose flamed temper often exasperates Bozz's tension with the idea of going to war. The war depicted in this production is not found on a battlefield, but on training grounds of a Louisiana-based instruction camp between conceptions and fears of the soldiers in training. This film is specifically about the preparation for war, nothing more nothing less. It ends when the soldiers finally go to war, kind of disappointing since witnessing the characters in action would have served as a supurb payoff. <br/><br/>	 Shot on location in about 28 days using 16mm stock and a minuscule budget, Joel Schumacher accurately displays a gritty, perverse, cruel, and unmerciful atmosphere using hand-held cinematography, unique lighting techniques and direct sound. Schumacher's grainy and blown-out images make the movie feel like a documentary feature. This unusual style of filmmaking only contributes to the hard core realism of the movie, quite graphic in its use of coarse language, perhaps a little too disturbing. Waves of four-letter words pound the audience, some in shock of what they are hearing. Even the extreme amount of vulgarism does not keep the dialogue from prevailing as heartbreaking, true, and emotional.<br/><br/>	If anything, ""Tigerland"" provides us with a minor appreciation of how much our soldiers go through for our country in the beginning stages of combat. Such bravery must it take to enlist in the army during times of war, knowing the hardships and risks that are being taken. Such thought-provoking ideas are made possible through the heartbreaking performances by the young aspiring actors who portray the various trainees. This movie is not for all audiences, but one that young men should take a look at before enlisting themselves in the army...and adult audiences should watch to appreciate the courage needed to do such."
"denryter18919","3","14","21","24 September 2009"," Not very accurate
","It's been awhile since I saw it and would not waste my time watching it again but as a Nam vet and NCO who went through Tigerland twice, once as a trainee and once as a training sergeant, this movie was very disappointing. Not real historically accurate on many fronts. Most importantly this whole deal about Bozz being such an individualist and non conformist is pure nonsense. The whole point of military training, especially for combat infantry is to eliminate individualism and get everyone playing on the same team. There is no room for non conformity in combat. Our combat units could not be effective if we had any doubt of what to expect from the guy or the unit next to us. Guys like the Bozz character depicted in this movie end up in the stockade or at least get run out of combat units. Although not technically a war movie because it covers only training for war, it is a movie whose central theme is about Vietnam and on that note I found it to be the second worst Vietnam genre movie behind only that miserable piece of garbage, Tunnel Rats."

","if you expect to view anything close to the way the Army was in that era. I went through basic training at Fort Polk in 1972. It was nothing like this film portrays ... the barracks and mess hall were made of what was called World War II wood -- the typical barracks design that housed millions of soldiers in World War II. That was not what was portrayed in the film. I could tell that the film was not filmed in Louisiana and looked it up -- filmed in Florida. Some filming at Camp Blanding - and I've been there but didn't recognize any of the areas from the camp in the film. I don't know about 1971, but in early 1972 the Vietnam war was drawing down and NO ONE from my company was sent to Vietnam. Personally, I was assigned to Germany. The conduct and troop interaction portrayed in the movie was unlike anything I witnessed at Fort Polk. First, no NCO (sergeant) or officer laid a hand on any recruit. There was no friction among soldiers as portrayed in the movie and no racial issues. We did have one guy who refused to take a bath and several platoon members threw him in a dumpster to get his attention and that worked. It is true that the Army was in very bad shape during that era. I and other new soldiers there were subjected to a lot of harassment, but many things were done as teaching points to help us survive if we had of been sent to Vietnam. Oh yeah, I pulled KP and never had to peel a potato - the Army had machines to peel potatoes in 1972."

","I was there in 1970. Most of the things that went on in this movie could never have happened unless as an isolated incident. Things like torture, etc. were never suggested or encouraged; in fact we were warned strongly and seriously against violations of military procedures. And the beatings of enlisted men by non-coms would surely have been reported and investigated by other non-coms and officers. These were enlisted men and draftees, not Special Forces or an elite covert unit! This movie turns out to be just another addition to the list of Hollywood fantasy pieces that claim realism but toss away truth when it gets in the way of their anti-war theme. For me, it was a very disappointing film."

","""Tigerland"" is a mixed bag.<br/><br/>As for being most definetly a career move, it´s a very clever one. Right after the intriguingly flawed ""Falling Down"" (1993) Mr. Schumacher was trying to kill his reputation by playing the hired-gun-director in a both megalomaniac and boring string of alternating John-Grisham- and Batman-movies. Somebody must have told him or maybe he sensed it himself, for ""Flawless"" (1999) and even ""8 MM"" (1998)tried to be real, stand-alone-movies and not part of a merchandising campaign. ""Tigerland"" looks like an even more radical departure from mainstream-big-bucks-movie-making. No stars, hand held camera, bleached out colors, blurred images: any- and everything in here - while Mr. Schumacher starts increasingly resembling a real director, an artist who cares about his art again - is shouting: ART! IMPORTANT! MESSAGE!<br/><br/>But that´s exactly the point where the problems start to overshadow the movie´s clever performance. Not for a single moment does ""Tigerland"" know weather it wants to be an anti-Vietnam movie in particular or an anti-war movie in general or a study on the effects of harsh, often even inhuman military training on young, unsuspecting males or a melodramatic comedy or a buddy movie or a too-clever-for-its-own-good-remake of Walter Hill´s masterpiece ""Southern Comfort"" (1981). If you don´t believe me check out the young leading man´s motivations and actions. He is introduced as a troublemaker who just can´t help causing trouble because the army and he match like heaven and hell. Keeping up some pretense of staying in character the film makers show him arranging to go A.W.O.L while constantly fighting his somehow dim witted and brutish superiors. But they´re not that brutal and dim witted as not to notice that our anti-war-hero is the best soldier in the whole rookie-platoon and a born leader too. Consequently he doesn´t leave camp but acknowledges his responsibilities. The longer the movie is running the more does it back my suspicion that for box-office-reasons Mr. Schumacher secretly wants his audience to root for ""Tigerland""´s hero because of his warrior´s abilities and not because of his contrasting, alas half-hearted tries to desert the army. Needless to say that this attitude undermines any of the film´s pretenses to be more than the average war-is-hell-but-someone-has-to-do-the-job-flick.<br/><br/>Don´t let ""Tigerland´s"" visual design fool you. And in case you want to see a really good movie about the effects of war an young men, give John Irvin´s much underrated, and unjustly so, ""Hamburger Hill"" (1987) a second chance."

","TIGERLAND takes place entirely within the confines of Infantry Training at Fort Polk, LA, and its immediate surroundings, 1971. The film itself does NOT actually go to Vietnam.<br/><br/>The whole character of Roland Bozz (memorably played by Colin Farrell) is utterly intriguing. He's a bit overblown: A would-be perfect soldier, perfect leader, perfect shot, in perfect physical and mental condition. . .a rough, cynical, yet still paradoxically gentle character who just doesn't like armies and war and killing. Nevertheless, I think it would have detracted from the film if Bozz were not a bit larger-than-life. Ditto for the other characters, including the sergeants (both the cruel, sadistic, war-maddened ones and the tough but professional ones) and the other trainees (an interesting and convincing bunch of mixed motivations). While TIGERLAND's plot is quite gripping, it's essentially a character-driven film in the end, and the exemplary acting by just about everyone is what makes it such a success.<br/><br/>I've noticed some other reviewers'--some of whom actually trained at Fork Polk during the Vietnam years--objections to TIGERLAND's depiction of the U.S. Army, particularly in regards to its training methods and employment of borderline-psychotic instructors. Duly noted, but it's safe to say that the U.S. military HAS made ample use of such methods/people at various times and places in the past. The film may not be perfectly realistic in every respect; however, it's also important to remember that it's set at a time when America, though still anemically hoping to win in Vietnam and still sending unfortunate draftees to same, was also trying to extricate itself from a war whose futility was becoming increasingly obvious. TIGERLAND captures the special malaise of the early '70s war with dead-eyed accuracy. Most importantly of all, it's a compelling portrayal of an anti-hero fighting against an army and system that doesn't play by any fair rules--not even its own."

","The movie Tigerland is a work of pure movie fiction. Nothing about it rings true: not the actor's accents, not the way the actors wore their uniforms, not the dialog and certainly not the training scenes. The most obvious fiction is showing the soldiers thinking and analyzing and philosophizing so much. In fact the soldiers in Tigerland were always too busy and or too tired to do much thinking , analyzing and philosophizing. When they did talk it was mostly about their lives before the Army and plans for their lives after. Mostly when they had free time they slept. I should know. I went through basic training and Tigerland at Fort Polk, Louisiana in 1967."

(I've met people like him) It shows how cruel the system can be and the merits of playing by your own rules.  In the end I like this film."
"bkoganbing","6","5","8","28 May 2010"," It Was Always Muddy
","It is certainly interesting to write a review about a film that took place where I actually resided for two months. In September of 1971 when this film is set, your's truly was doing his basic training at Fort Polk, Louisiana. I did get to the North Fort at one point in my training where the infamous Tigerland was located. In fact Tigerland was a nickname given to the whole northern part of the army base.<br/><br/>I was doing the basic training to be a weekend warrior and avoid Vietnam. But I saw so many of the kids who were just like the ones portrayed in the film it was actually a rather nerve wrecking old home week. In 1971 everyone except the policy makers in Washington knew that this was going to end when as Senator George Aiken declared, we said we won and then went home. And of course the South Vietnamese government we were protecting would fold like a napkin.<br/><br/>By that time the army was scraping the bottom for soldier material and you can see it in the company of men that are in Tigerland. This is where more soldiers shipped for Vietnam than any other place in the nation. The Louisiana swamps best approximated the climate conditions of Vietnam.<br/><br/>This particular company has a real odd ball in it with Colin Farrell. He's doing his best to get out of the army, but the army just won't oblige him. So he's waging his own war against them by becoming a 'barracks lawyer' and getting others out. And he's driving the officers and NCOs quite nuts doing it.<br/><br/>I would rate Tigerland a lot higher because there is much I liked about the film. It was not shot at Fort Polk, but in places that gave you feel of the place. What I remember best about it was rain and mud. In that summer of 1971 it rained nearly every single day I was there. But the rain and sometimes it would come a few times a day. Would be a sudden downpour, maybe at most 20 minutes then it would cool off and then resume being muggy. And the ground couldn't absorb it fast enough so it was always muddy. You did your best work in that brief period after rain stopped it was then actually decent enough for normal activities.<br/><br/>What I couldn't quite grasp was Colin Farrell's motivations for what he was doing. I blame that on the writer and also the director.<br/><br/>As for the other players the best in the cast was Thomas Guiry playing this poor sad sack kid from the Louisiana bayous. I met a few just like him, he stopped his formal education at the 6th grade. It was a touching performance on Guiry's part.<br/><br/>So here's to Fort Polk, not a place I recommend, but sometimes a place which is needed to train our soldiers. It got a good film, but not a great one in its honor."
"jbroppelt","2","4","6","20 December 2013"," Not quite the way it was
","Having served in the military and did my AIT at Ft. Polk which included the Tigerland experience, I must concede that in no way did the movie reflect my experience. The Military operates within a certain Protocol which was obviously absent in the movie, furthermore a disruptive force would have been neutralized or removed from the equation ASAP.Of course the locations resembled the actual training facility as well as the barracks and the interaction of the troops which consisted of a group of men from all walks of life thrown into a living condition of close quarters that none of us were accustomed to. also the off post locations had that gritty feel of what actually transpired in that quaint little town called Leesville."

","The opening scenes of TIGERLAND with army recruits being screamed at by NCOs are very reminiscent of FULL METAL JACKET . In fact the more TIGERLAND goes on the more you`ll be reminded of PLATOON  , SPR , SOUTHERN COMFORT etc . This is by no means an original film . That said TIGERLAND does have some impressive aspects like the performances . If you don`t know this already let me point out that Colin Farrell is from Dublin in Ireland . It`s impossible to not notice this in real life as he talks in an almost indecipherable Irish brouge . Here however he`s utterly convincing as Bozz a reluctant recruit from Texas . Likewise the director Joel Schumacher directs with immense skill making the film look like a fly on the wall documentary . In fact I often forget that this was a feature film and I was watching something that actually took place . Oh and this is the same Joel Schumacher who directed BATMAN and ROBIN . Yup<br/><br/>The script is rather strange however . It rightly points out the unpopularity of the Vietnam war and how the American army was totally demoralised by it in 1971 . By this time American officers and NCOs were in as much danger of being fragged by their own men than by the enemy and there were almost as many servicemen being treated for opium poisoning in South East Asia than were treated for battlefield wounds , but this leads to a major plothole : Why are so many Americans still accepting the draft when they don`t want to ? I do notice that Bozz takes the part of a barrack room lawyer and allows some of these extremely reluctant recruits to be exempted which means they don`t have to emigrate or look over their shoulder on the run from the draft but it`s almost as if they knew they`d be meeting Bozz at boot camp . Doesn`t this strike you as hopelessly contrived ? And I`m very confused as to why Bozz wants to stay in the army since he doesn`t want to be there either<br/><br/>All in all TIGERLAND is a success down to its rising star and director . But be warned if you`re a lover of blood and guts war films you`ll be rather disappointed and ironically if you hate war films you`ll also hate this too"

","A forgotten film and a war film with no actual war in it, Michael Schumacher's criminally underrated and vastly underseen gem is one of the eclectic filmmaker's best feature films and the film that launched its then relatively unknown star Colin Farrell into the Hollywood scene.<br/><br/>Released to solid reviews but a paltry box office run in 2000, Tigerland is a fictionalised account of the Louisiana based army training camp of the same name that operated in the 1960's/early 70's to get American soldiers ready to not only make it in the US Army but to survive the harsh, unrelenting and life and death surroundings of the increasingly hated Vietnam war.<br/><br/>Focussing its attention on a small core of raggedy wannabe soldiers that includes Farrell's disruptive and calculating Roland Bozz, Matthew Davis's thoughtful Jim Paxton, Clifton Collins Jr's on edge Pvt. Miter and Shea Whigham's unhinged Pvt. Wilson, Schumacher's film doesn't feel dissimilar to one long extended take on the beginnings of Full Metal Jacket but it carves out its own unique slice of war pie and becomes a totally unique and quietly moving study on the Vietnam war and those that inhabited it.<br/><br/>It's a brave move by Schumacher to eschew going to the muddy battlegrounds of Vietnam but it pays dividends for Tigerland's fortunes.<br/><br/>Filmed in a grainy, documentary like style with 16mm cameras, Tigerland feels like a genuine product of the era and there's very little cinematic flair to the film which is unusual for Schumacher who has found his greatest successes with over the top productions and big budget events. With a realistic feel, Tigerland's power to portray war away from the actual gunfights of Vietnam is impressive as these man all begin to understand themselves and come to realise what they really want, whether it's to fight or flee.<br/><br/>Farrell's character of Roland Bozz is also one of the more memorable creations in the war genre of cinema. A man who could clearly be the type of one-eyed American pride soldier the Army is seeking but instead becomes a constant nuisance, refusing to give in to a war he doesn't believe in and a cause he can't get behind, it's a transfixing performance by Farrell and Bozz is a character that will continue to surprise for the entirety of the running time.<br/><br/>Overall Tigerland features a hugely impressive ensemble of actors and will likely remain one of Schumacher's most impressive feats as a director of actors and a restrained yet powerful piece of the filmmakers varying catalogue of feature films.<br/><br/>Final Say - <br/><br/>A war film with a truly identifiable difference, Tigerland is easily one of Schumacher's best films and actor Colin Farrell's finest moment in front of camera, a turn he slowly seems to be inching towards once more with his recent works. Tigerland is a quintessential piece of cinematic history when it comes to both Vietnam examinations and the psychology of war.<br/><br/>4 ½ peeled potatoes out of 5"
"Svenstadt","10","3","5","11 April 2018"," Best war movie I've ever seen.
","This movie has all the right elements in it and strikes a sympathetic tone. Colin Farrell is the kind of hero that makes movies great; he makes you want to care about the character. Also, it is a war movie but isn't set in war but rather before the war, and the stress going into the war is often greater than the war itself, so it has a kind of ' more is less ' thing going on in that sense. This movie could be described as extremely raw in nature: the sex scene is raw and very hot, the performances are raw, the fight scene between the hero and villain, Pvt. Wilson, makes you feel like you are witnessing a real fight. You will feel the stress as the characters move into and out situations of what you think you would feel in real life. In addition to having a realistic portrayal of the attitudes of the characters at this point in the war which, having studied Vietnam, I can tell you it is consistent with actual experiences."

","Tigerland was the name of a U.S. Army training camp located at Fort Polk, Louisiana. Tagged as the second worst part of the Earth, it was a recreation of the Vietnamese jungle and was used to prepare American soldiers for the hellish terrain they were soon to be fighting in. <br/><br/>Directed by Joel Schumacher, Tigerland stars Colin Farrell as Private Roland Bozz, a reluctant recruit to the war effort who upsets his superiors by having a canny knack for exploiting loop holes in the rule book. However, it's evident that Bozz has leadership qualities, but can the officers convince him he is born to lead? <br/><br/>By the time of Tigerland's release, the Vietnam movie had apparently run its course. The announcement that Joel Schumacher was to delve into the conflict for his next movie was met with less than enthusiastic responses. This was after all the director who had not too long prior reduced the once darkly watchable Batman franchise to comedy campy ham overdrive. Alarm bells were further starting to go off when it was revealed that it was to be a short low budget shoot of 28 days, with a cast of unknowns and filmed in grainy 16 millimetre. Yet two things were forgotten by his many detractors. One was that Schumacher had showed himself capable of guiding a young vibrant cast to high levels of watch-ability (The Lost Boys), and two, that he had made Falling Down in the early 90s, thus tricky and darker edged material was not beyond him. <br/><br/>Tigerland is a fine film, there is no actual conflict to observe other than the interactions between Bozz, his fellow squadies and his superiors. This is more boot camp drama than a film about military engagements. But the impact is much the same as our group of young men prepare for a fate that doesn't exactly have favourable odds; their respective reasons for being there in the first place containing varying degrees of bravado or disbelief. To which, much to his initial bemusement, Bozz simultaneously becomes a beacon of hope to many and a figure for revilement. The out-shot of this is that Tigerland winds up an expertly crafted movie, one that is propelled by great acting and one that quietly sneaks up on you and cloaks you in sadness. <br/><br/>Schumacher is not the sole reason for why the film works so well though, he had some quality help. Ross Klavan and Michael McGruther's screenplay rises above the character clichés that exist in every army training camp based movie. Helped enormously by Klavan drawing on his real life experiences in the army, Tigerland doesn't hurtle towards its climax (a climax that is understated and poignant), it takes its time, characters are formed and with the then unknown Farrell on stupendously bewitching form, it's as engaging as a Vietnam film gets. This in spite of the grim look of the piece as Matthew Libatique's cinematography strips away vibrant colours and uses murky greys and greens to put the viewer right in there with them at boot camp. The look, the feel and the story all pull together nicely, making Tigerland fit to be mentioned in the same breath as those popular Vietnam movies from the previous decades. 8/10"

","Really touching story of a recruitment camp in America, where young men are prepared for the Vietnam war. The human study always appealed to me when it comes to war movies, because it translates personal, subjective opinions on war, opposed war action movies where action, and technical data are being analyzed to the prejudice of the human factor. <br/><br/>The movie manages to put a new spin on an already ancient subject, and manages to distance itself from usual war movies, especially by focusing on an anti-hero from the view-point of traditional standard. The movie focuses on the tragic character of Bozz, who smartly avoids being sucked in by the dehumanizing war machine, and refuses to give up control over his destiny and fight for something he doesn't believe in, spends his energy in searching ways to avoid being sent overseas, both for himself and comrades and ironically ends up finding his own just reason for finally going to war. Perfect irony.<br/><br/>The acting is truly exceptional, and the documentary-style shooting almost makes you feel transposed into the movie. Also the movie will provide food for thought for those exhilarated by the action in usual war movies or war-games enthusiasts, hopefully awakening some minds of a generation which luckily escaped the terror of being drafted."

","""Tigerland"" is a Vietnam War movie the way that ""The Unforgiven"" is a Western.<br/><br/>It's more a Universal Soldier movie, as ""Fortunate Son"" is not on the soundtrack, or virtually any other period music. It is comparable to the fine, underrated ""Full Metal Jacket"" as it's more about basic training than Vietnam. It certainly won't be a recruiting film for Today's Army that is trying to use participatory Sigma Quality Management Circles to retain better educated soldiers.<br/><br/>Colin Farrell is mesmerizing as the Rebel With A Cause--to clear the Army of misfits, sadists and undesirables, including himself. There's a neat, original scene when he gets a tough barking sergeant to reveal his first name.<br/><br/>In general, young hard-bodies are feasts for the eyes, even if it's hard to tell crew-cutted objects apart.<br/><br/>The cinematography looks effectively TV newsreelish, especially as it's really a memory play about our youth looming large and mythic over the rest of our lives.<br/><br/>(originally written 10/7/2000)"

The story of the training of the soldiers, fighting with their superiors, and in the end grouping together.<br/><br/>From the very beginning to the very end. This is one War Drama worth seeing if you are in for the constant cussing (at times beyond reason) and the horrors of what boot camp are.<br/><br/>The dynamics of how the actors interacted was quite amazing at times, and sometimes humorous. How Bozz (Colin Farrel) deals with Paxton (Matthew Davis) throughout the storyline, from camp to Tigerland, and even in the end helping him.<br/><br/>The innovative free-hand filming did add a certain taste or flavor to the film. Constant moving, constant action, and just constant confusion. At times, it was a help. Others, not so much.<br/><br/>Throughout the film, it was increasingly realistic. Some points in the film (the sex scenes in particular) seemed to be just a tad too realistic even though they added an effect to the movie that wouldn't have been there without them. it was a very gritty movie, through and through.<br/><br/>In my opinion, this is one of Colin Farrel's better movies (if not his top performance).

"ajs-10","7","2","3","22 March 2011"," Training was never like this!...
","This is, again, a film I have seen before, and, again, I got a lot more out of it second time around. I have to blame my good buddy Mr. The Aus Man for pointing me in the direction of this one this week. Otherwise I may have watched one from 'The (now famous) List'. But I digress; I will give you my thoughts on this one after a brief summary (summary haters and those that don't wish to know anything about the plot please ""GIVE ME TEN SOLDIER!"" while I write the next paragraph).<br/><br/>It is 1971 and at the U.S. Army Training camp at Fort Polk, Louisiana, the new recruits are getting ready for their eight weeks' training. This will culminate in a visit to the infamous 'Tigerland', an area made to look and feel like Viet Nam. One soldier, Pvt. Roland Bozz, doesn't want to be there and he tries everything he can to get himself discharged, but the Army won't budge. He's a humanitarian who does not want to fight. He is befriended by Pvt. Jim Paxton, an aspiring writer. Bozz is very good at getting people out of the army who have a legitimate reason, and he gains a bit of a reputation for this. The brass doesn't know what to do with him, but he eventually shows leadership qualities and is made platoon Sergeant. This does not go down well with the psychopathic Pvt. Wilson, who takes it personally when Bozz has him removed from the platoon. Eventually they reach the stage where they have to go to Tigerland, and Bozz has a surprise waiting for him there. I've probably said too much, but I'll leave it there so as not to make the Spoiler Police too upset.<br/><br/>At first I thought this film is trying so hard to be Kubrick's 1987 classic, Full Metal Jacket, but I was proved wrong. Although it's not quite as good as that, it's still pretty good. Good performances all round, particularly from; Colin Farrell as Bozz, Matthew Davis as Paxton, Clifton Collins Jr. as Miter, Tom Guiry as Cantwell and Shea Whigham as Wilson.<br/><br/>As I said at the beginning, I have seen this film before, but I really couldn't remember much about it. On a second viewing, I can see I missed a pretty good film, maybe not brilliant, but certainly a good effort. The picture has kind of a news report feel about it, with slightly washed out colours and quite a bit of hand-held photography. Over all, a pretty enjoyable film that keeps the audience interested and has a few interesting plot twists Recommended.<br/><br/>My score: 7.3/10"
"paul2001sw-1","9","1","1","21 October 2005"," Best in class
","The dehumanising effect of war is a much-studied subject in the movies; as is the equally dehumanising, but potentially life-saving, dehumanising effect of military training. Joel Schumacher's 'Tigerland' follows the standard template, we see men treated like dirt but emerging as soldiers, with a degree of mutual respect for their commanding officers, and judgement is reserved on whether such an extreme process can be considered justified; as is judgement of the merits of the war for which they are being trained (typically, as here, Vietnam). But 'Tigerland' has an interesting take, by centring its account on a cocky dissident named Bozz (played outstandingly well by Colin Farrell), who understands that all power governs ultimately by consent, and the lack of awareness among the powerless of their own complicity. Around this character, a taught, gripping plot has been constructed, and it's also a plus that the action never leaves America (whereas Stanley Kubrick's 'Full Metal Jacket', to name just one other film of a similar type, lost focus once the action shifted to Asia). Although this is not a film of staggering originality, it's supremely well done and captivating viewing throughout: the best film from this director that I've seen, and among the very best of its genre."

","I thought this movie was a one of a kind war film - one that shows heart without coming across all over-the-top Hollywood schmaltzy. A magnetic Colin Farrell gives an amazing performance, bringing a heartbreaking pathos to his role. You're immediately captivated by Roland Bozz, drawn to his cause and captured by his feeling. Without even going into the thick of battle, you experience the hell and pain of war, and empathise with the characters Boz saves from the front line. I couldn't recommend this movie enough, even to those who would normally shy away from war films. This is unique - a movie with heart strewn amongst the grit of American war-porn. Farrell's acting is second to none, four years on this remains his best role. Additionally the directing is close to brilliant and the camera work stunning."

","Wise words.  Not mine, of course, but nevertheless a maxim that seems especially relevant in these times of fighting first and seeking answers to the important questions later.<br/><br/>I like that Colin Farrell as 'Bozz' is not necessarily an anti-hero in the ""Catcher-in-the-Rye"" style sense; or a character who's too strong for his own movie (it belongs to a few other notables just as much as he).  We don't need someone to root for or hate, because escaping the situation and the decisions that led us there represents an 'end' in itself.<br/><br/>No, ""Tigerland"" isn't the first movie to draw our attention to the futility of combat; I'm sure it won't be the last - it doesn't even earn a distinction for its high quality alone.  These reasons, though certainly pleasant, are not why it scores its praise from me.  It's about 'moral' characters stranded where they don't belong.  It's rightly sensitive enough, though, to be aware that in the 'real' world it's happening concurrently with our daily lives, and crucially WITHOUT the 'safeguards' that fiction provides...<br/><br/>Forget the intense camerawork, (the great film ""Salvador"" did it first... ) and even try and brush aside the fact that this is Schumacher in thoughtful - but non-sappy or sensational - mode for once.  See it for its themes, instead - and perhaps leave it a more 'conscious' person than you were before.<br/><br/>(9/10, or *****/***** in profile ratings system.)"

","If you want to watch a movie and feel good about watching it, then Tigerland is the film for you. I love this movie from top to bottom. This movie's picture-perfect scenes look so real; it's almost like a documentary of something that happened in real life but with drama. Boy, I tell you... REAL drama they actually real ""fought"" in one of the scenes (get the DVD listen to the commentary its not obvious). I see this film as a bunch of desperate young men trying to escape an ill-fated destiny, after watching Saving Private Ryan I have an a appreciation of what an ""ill-fated destiny"" is and know exactly how the men in the film feel. I see this movie as a crossbreed between ""Stand By Me"" and ""Saving Private Ryan."" What do men do when they are with a situation that's ""hard pressed"" in real life? Some men go crazy, some men cry, some men through fists, others do drugs, some randomly sleep with hookers ruthlessly trying to eradicate the meaning of love from their life, some try drink the pain away, some jump off buildings or bridges, some feel guilty and others feel so much agony it makes them so sick they collapse - physically. This movie has all those desperate emotions rolled into one ball. But don't get me wrong its not depressing movie, its realistic, its a very very humorous movie, the cocky and funny Bozz (Collin's Character) lights it all up, and on top of that there are about 5 female actresses in the movie; I'll let you figure out what their in there for! With dialogue, war/action sequences, picture perfect scenes along with appropriate music; this movie has it all, like I said: from top to bottom. I don't why Tigerland is heavily under-credited. The best thing about owning the movie is that on the cover it says in big bold writing ""The best film of the year,"" and it absolutely falls nothing short of that. Keep the rare gems coming Hollywood, 10/10."

The moment Bozz gets command of the squad you recognize it all - let the troublemaker have command in order to learn responibility.

","I realise that the US Army was demoralised by 1971, but this film was unbelievable. It was supposed to be a training camp not the SS punishment battalion in a Sven Hassell novel. The writer must be a real Army hater. The psycho sergeant who kept beating the crap of people belonged in a prison cell, and the useless Black top sergeant should have been sacked as well. These men were going overseas, the receiving units would surely have wondered where all the unusable damaged recruits were coming from, and an investigation would have ensued. The scene that blew it completely was the electrocution one. Farrell, the alleged barrack room lawyer, would have had the instructor over a barrel for issuing an illegal order ( to torture POWs in contravention to the Geneva Convention ), actual assault on an enlisted man, sexual assault and conduct unbecoming an officer. Intead he just walks away. After this, discipline brakes down into a madhouse level and the film becomes unwatchable. I don't know how it ended, I went to bed."

","I'd gotten the impression that this was just another autobiographical study of the hardships of an Army training camp, rather like ""Jarhead."" Instead, it's an interesting piece about suffering, responsibility, and testosterone.<br/><br/>It's 1971. Colin Farrell and Mathew Davis are friends, sort of, just out of basic training, now in infantry school in the Louisiana. The final week is spent at an isolated camp which replicates the conditions of Vietnam, called Tigerland. Soldiers speak of Tigerland in hushed, frightened voices.<br/><br/>I don't know why they dread it so much because, as it turns out, except for one psychopathic maniac, it's not that much worse than infantry school. The sergeants should foul curses at the men, shove them, kick them, beat them to the ground and literally make them eat dirt.<br/><br/>Plaudits for the photography, the casting, the performances, and the direction, which, thank Bog, doesn't use a wobbling camera except for a few minutes during a live fire exercise. No CGIs and no slow motion action. Nobody runs away from an exploding fireball. Nothing explodes. What a relief.<br/><br/>The plot is an amalgam of elements familiar from other stories. There is the non-conformist who invites disaster by not cowering like everyone else -- ""From Here To Eternity,"" ""Cool Hand Luke."" The soldier who is a natural leader of men but continually turns down responsibility -- ""To Hell And Back,"" ""Fixed Bayonets."" The main message of the movie shouldn't raise anyone's hackles. Vietnam was a pointless shedding of blood, but it's not the Army's fault. They do everything possible to prepare the men for combat, even if it looks (and is) sadistic. The war was foolish but the men in uniform aren't to blame. How can it be wrong?"

Yes, Hollywood schlockmeister Schumacher, responsible for crap like 'St Elmo's Fire' and 'The Lost Boys' and the man who made two absolutely awful Batman movies, attempts to recreate the likes of raw and powerful Danish dramas 'Festen' and 'The Idiots'. Now it sounded like a recipe for disaster to me but I was intrigued enough to give it a shot... My immediate reaction is that the Dogme angle is extremely misleading. The movie uses similar hand held camera work and lack of ""blockbuster"" touches but it in no way captures the intensity and honesty of Vinterberg or Von Trier. This IS Joel Schumacher after all. I suppose it shows you that it is talent and not technique that really matters. I had two main problems with 'Tigerland'. One is Colin Farrell who I have absolutely no interest in. Apparently he's supposed to be something special, but I really don't see it. As an actor and as a character I just couldn't into what he was doing. The movie is a love letter to Bozz and if you feel nothing towards him then there's really very little left. The other problem is that we've seen it all before, BETTER. I'm trying not to use these three words but I can't help myself - Full Metal Jacket. There, I did it. 'Tigerland' is pretty forgettable.

","Tigerland is nothing short of average. Despite it's critical acclaims and longstanding fans I found the film to be just okay and went straight for shock value which in a film about war, in particular a brutal war such as Vietnam this could be a good thing but the shock value doesn't come from war but just pure mainstream ""R"" Rated Garbage. Tigerland will burn out your ears from even the most seasoned swearer...brings a new meaning to swears like a sailor. There are some brilliant and incredibly emotional performances and a great story as well but it's overshadowed but what seems to me to be unrealistic violence and if I am wrong I gladly take it back.<br/><br/>Tigerland takes place entirely in a fiction ""boot camp"" of sorts that trains young soldiers to go to Nam. If Americans truly treated each other in this fashion which is nothing short of horrible torture to each other, and completely undemocratic behavior. Joel Schumacher is definitely a seasoned director and has done everything from comic adaptations (two Batman films) to action, to suspense to musicals. He seems to me to be a ""hit and miss"" director. He doesn't really have a defined style and some of his films are good and some aren't and I think it more depends on the story presented to him than his direction.<br/><br/>Tigerland is fascinating in the way that it's a completely different angle on the Vietnam war. Instead of seeing actual battle we see soldiers preparing to go to a war that most of them don't believe in, we see their lives that they don't want to leave and beneath their tough exterior. Colin Farrell who is generally heralded for this film does a good job, don't get me wrong, in fact it might be one of his best performances as the defiant and seemingly selfish Pvt. Roland Bozz. But he's not the stand out role in the film. He does a good job and his character development is excellent but it's not stunning. Instead some of the lesser roles turn out to be the really watchable ones. Clifton Collins Jr. plays Pvt. Miter who tries his utmost to fit in but ends up in a serious break down. Shea Whigham as the insane, angry Pvt. Wilson also does a great job. Combined with all the other seemingly minor roles these characters create an intense, dark and gritty atmosphere. Unfortunately this is overshadowed with graphic sex scene, horrid language and brutality that seems unrealistic. The story itself seems filled with plot holes. If soldiers were truly tortured in this nature why would they let soldiers go so easily?? It raises too many questions being entirely fictional. Nonetheless for adults who really want to see a different angle on the Nam war. 7/10"

If anything this movie is more like the beginning of full metal jacket when they are at basic training and what experiences they have their. i think Colin Ferrel did a excellent job acting in this movie and i believe it is one of his first big movies, but i can not confirm that. <br/><br/>just giving you my opinion peace out Giltronic"

","Next to the Second World War, the Vietnam War is probably the most popular one by the film makers. There have been made several excellent Vietnam movies (think for instance of ""Apocalypse Now"", ""The Deer Hunter"", ""Platoon"",...) and that sometimes makes me doubt if there is still room for one more. But there are of course many aspects that haven't been shown too often yet and one of those is the training. The only movie that has focused on the training before is ""Full Metal Jacket"", Stanley Kubrick's version of the Vietnam war and I guess that's the best movie to compare this one with.<br/><br/>""Tigerland"" shows how a platoon of recruits arrives in Ft. Polk for infantry training before leaving for war. The war has almost been lost and many try to avoid being send over there, but before it even gets that far they will have to get through their final week which takes place in Tigerland, a swamp similar to Vietnam. One of the recruits is Roland Bozz. He keeps getting into trouble and being thrown in jail because of his rebellious behavior, but he also gets a lot of respect from his comrades as he helps misfits to get discharges. And even though he has some leadership capacities, not everybody likes him. One sociopath in his platoon will try to get rid of him, making ""Tigerland"" almost as dangerous as the war itself...<br/><br/>What I missed most about this movie were the actual battle scenes. You only get to see the training, but you don't know how they manage in Vietnam. Will they be able to survive, who gets killed or wounded,... nothing of that can be found in the movie and that's also the main reason why I have some difficulties with calling this a war movie.<br/><br/>However, that doesn't mean that this movie isn't any good. This movie has plenty of good things to offer so you'll stay interested until the last moment. Despite the lack of many known names, the acting certainly is worth noticing. Colin Farrell is probably the best-known, but the other actors certainly don't have to be ashamed of what they did in this movie either. Overall this movie certainly isn't as good as ""Full Metal Jacket"", but as a character study it isn't bad. Thanks to the good acting, this movie overcomes the lack of a larger story and makes it more than OK to fill an hour and a half with. I give this movie a score between 7/10 and 7.5/10."

","** SPOILERS AHEAD **<br/><br/>Recap: A platoon of recruits, with some basic training, is to undergo training, to become infantry soldiers at Ft Polk and the notorious camp Tigerland, before being sent of to Vietnam. The platoon is a mix of young men, some eager to go and some not at all so eager. And then there is Pvt Bozz (Farrell). He spent most of his basic training in the stockade, and consequently challenges or ignores the military authority. In a military waging a losing war, training young men to become killing machines, he just wants to be human, as the tagline says. This leads to controversies within his platoon. Poor Pvt. Cantwell (Guiry), I believe it was, who was appointed day officer, charged with keeping Bozz in line, has no easy task. And both suffer from it. But as pressure keeps building up through training, a few soldiers sooner, or later, realizes that the military is not their way. But the army in not to let any potential soldier walk away, and only a few of them walks away with the help of Bozz. But his ways creates a lot of enemies as well both within the ranks of officers and within his own platoon. And this might be a problem when you're training with real weapons and real ammo...<br/><br/>Comments: A very good movie with a deep, consistent and catching story. There were no moments where you wanted, or were able to drift off. Also no annoying goofs or plot holes that stole away some focus. I also thought that the entire cast, with Farrell in the lead, gave very good performances. In conclusion I don't really have much to say or comment other than to me, the movie and the entire experience was both well worked through and based on a well thought through ground.<br/><br/>8/10"

","Tigerland is a good movie.  However, I think people are overrating it just because it is far superior to anything else Joel Schumacher has done.  I liked the story and I enjoyed the characters, but haven't we seen all of this before.  We have the drill sergeant(s) who use the f-word ad nauseum. We have the troublemaker trying to get out of the army.  We have the small, weak soldier who shouldn't be there in the first place.  And of course, we have the overzealous, on the edge soldier who just wants to kill Charlie.<br/><br/>Colin Farrell's performance is good as Bozz, but I can't help notice that his Irish accent steps in ocassionally in every movie I've seen him in.  I thought the performances of Matthew Davis, and especially Cole Hauser were very strong.  <br/><br/>I admire the fact that they tried to portray Bozz as a guy who is simply confused and doesn't want to be in the army.  He's not a ""bleeding heart"", or a anti-war activist.  He just doesn't want to go.  This is the strongest aspect of the movie.  The movie is not anti-war.  In fact, it's not really about war at all.  It's about this character, and the way he acts and reacts to and around others."

","I think I'm going off ""Vietnam""-movies for good. They just seem to have become (or -- probably -- always have been) a vehicle for hunky young actors to allow them to pose in macho garb (t-shirts, camo fatigues and dog-tags -- you know the score) and to toy around with guns and explosives. Tigerland at least uses a fairly innovative setting (a training camp in the US rather than the actual war theatre -- which had the nice side effect of making it a fairly inexpensive movie to make, and which spared me the usual ""Argh! Oh no, Johnny! You bastards!!! Takatakataka""-battle scenes), but any attempts to deliver new insights are stunted by director Joel Schumacher who instead prefers to go for a visual celebration of hunkiness coupled with wobbly hand-camera / digital video visuals.<br/><br/>One particular scene that stuck to my mind, if only for it's unabashed campness, is when the film's lead buddies hang out together after they have just had sex with two nightclub floozies (like in all Vietnam movies, when the soldiers are not being yelled at by sadistic drill sergeants or engaging in battle scenes with more fireworks than July 4.th, they're instantly having sex with whorish women). They seem to be so into each other, and so completely disinterested in the girls, that I wouldn't have been surprised if one of them had broken out the baby oil (""Here, let me soothe you -- do you work out?"" ""Oh, it feels so good...""), thereby earning this scene a cult following in the gay community.<br/><br/>The only thing that can be said for Colin Farrell is that he disguises his Irish brogue effectively and that he has poster-boy looks. If you fancy him then this movie probably is a must-see for you. You even get a glance of his naked butt."

","I went to Ft. Polk in September '69 and saw all of this up close and very personal. ""Tigerland"" captures the feel of Army Basic Training and Ft. Polk, Louisiana like no other.  For those who didn't experience the place (or Army Basic at any other location during those days), the film may not come off as much of an accomplishment, but the realism of life at Polk and the characters brought back memories to me from 35 years ago that I had long forgotten.  The character of Bozz was interesting (much of a Cool Hand Luke), but the other characters, in particular Miter, were superb. As I watched, I could have sworn Miter was a backwoods Louisiana boy from my platoon.<br/><br/>Tigerland may not be a big seller or an Academy Award winner, but it gets my vote for an absolutely On Target portrayal."

","This is an interesting take on Vietnam films, as it must be one of the few movies about this war, that is NOT set in Vietnam. This film concentrates on the gruelling training that the soldiers had to endure before being sent to 'Nam. After their basic training, platoons are sent for another 8 weeks of incredibly intensive training (where the story begins), after which, they have another week or two of training in Tigerland. Tigerland has been created by the military to mimic the Vietnamese conditions and surroundings that the soldiers will experience - so it is kind of like a dry run, if you will, but it is no walk in the park, that's for sure!<br/><br/>Colin Farrell is amazing in this film and is supported by a decent cast of unknowns. The film actually reminds me a little of Full Metal Jacket, which certainly isn't a bad thing.<br/><br/>I strongly urge you to watch this film at your next available opportunity, even if you don't like war movies - the film is more of a study of human nature - the war just provides a kind of backdrop for the well-written and well-acted story."

","Tigerland for me was a defining film. I know films about vietnam have been done time and time again but I thought that this film deflected away from the normal follow through of being in actual combat and being told the same old story each time, except, its rapped up in a different cover.  Tigerland is an extreme disclosed account of young men being offloaded to boot camp to be complied into a fighting force to which will be sent off to die for politicans to don't care about  them...........so in consequence to their ignorance of their higher state of priority a young man Bozz, stands up for himself and for his fellow man, showing his superiors his characteristics, i.e leadership, strong willed, cocky etc but also portraying, like normal human beings a softer side, compansion and feeling to his fellow soliders. I liked the character Bozz (played by Colin Farrell) because like my screen idol, Steve Mc Queen's character Hilts in the acclaimed war film The Great Escape, he is outspoken and stands for his beliefs but also cares for others. Joel Schumacher came up trumps with this film even though I was starting to lose faith in his ability to make a film which would not be torn apart."

","Schumacher is, in my opinion, quite an inconsistent director. He has made terrible movies such as the two Batman movies, but when he pairs up with Colin Farrel magic is made! Both Tigerland, and the recently released Phone Booth are  excellent movies despite modest budgets and a fairly unknown cast. Farrel carries Phone Booth entirely on his, in terms of dramatic talent, very broad shoulders, and even though he has much more of a supporting cast in Tigerland, he steals the picture and provides acting of such quality that more modest performances are hardly noticed.<br/><br/>Tigerland is quite an unusual Vietnam movie, provided that the story does in fact not take its course in Vietnam , but in the United States in preparation camps prior to posting in Vietnam. But Schumacher makes this work to his advantage (he usually makes his best movies,when he takes chances and tries something out of the ordinary) and,in blissful cooperation with Farrel, gives a very interesting look into the minds of young men pondering issues such as death and honor in the face of combat. This is a commendable movie, and Schumacher deserves a lot of credit for his few experimental movies such as this and Phone Booth. Watch it and enjoy Farrel's smartass attitude, or merely his sublime acting, and the skillful direction of Schumacher!"

Considering that the only actor I'd ever seen before when I first watched this movie was Cole Hauser (did very well with his short role, loved his lecture in the dark about Bozz's cigarette, definately one to look out for) and the Spanish guy that was in TRAFFIC (""I'm a butcher."" ""You haven't killed anyone, yet."" ""No, really, I'm a butcher. I cut meat.""), I was definately impressed by all the gret acting. Now that Colin Farrell's making it big, I'm sure plenty of people are seeing him on the cover and renting this movie, and they won't be disappointed. It's about Basic-Training, starts out kinda like FULL METAL JACKET, and introduces a lot of very well-developed characters and morality and the general feeling of rebellion and/or duty of the era. And since I saw this with my 75 year old grandmother, the butt-shots would've embarrassed me if I hadn't looked over at her and seen her smiling.

TIGERLAND is an anti-war movie, and as such I can understand why some of you crazy veterans out there don't like it. One man, from Texas, complains on this site that Bozz is poison for the unit, and I disagree. He was acting in the best interest of his unit, getting two guys out of the war who had no business going. And in the end, he goes to war in place of his friend Jim, who's injuries (inflicted on purpose by Bozz) have allowed him a discharge. The men respect him because he cares whether they live or die, and there is nothing wrong with that.  And when it comes down to it, he will fight if he has to. But he doesn't quite see the point of killing other innocent pawns who are as much the tools of their government as our GI's in war.<br/><br/>As for Schumacher, he's done some good films in the past. THE LOST BOYS is just one example of that. But after BATMAN AND ROBIN I thought he might just slit his wrists in his bathtub or something. What a comeback.<br/><br/>Farrell is fantastic in this movie, and it got him the role in MINORITY REPORT which no doubt helped him get PHONE BOOTH, which I hear is excellent. He's a draw because the ladies like him. But like Cruise (Not MI:2 Cruise,A FEW GOOD MEN or VANILLA SKY Cruise) and Brad Pitt, he' not just a pretty boy.

There are really two reasons for this.<br/><br/>The first is a baffling one, the Director Joel Schumacher.  A man who directs such crap as Bad Company, 8MM and the franchise derailing Batman & Robin, shows a flash of his potential brilliance.  Schumacher creates a beautiful, 16mm style that places us IN the boot camp with the characters, without drawing from the story.  Tigerland seems to prove necessity is the mother of invention, shot with a reported $7 million dollar budget, Schumacher does wonders.<br/><br/>But what really makes this movie, is Collin Farrell.  He has a truly breakthrough performance as Bozz, a young man rebelling against army training and himself.  Before getting to the big time in Minority Report and Phone Booth (also Schumacher), Farrell was discovered here.  Bozz should go down as a classic unlikely hero, in the vein of The Cooler King.

","WARNING: MINOR PLOT POINTS GIVEN AWAY AHEAD<br/><br/>Those who watched TIGERLAND and categorized it as 'just another war film' have unfortunately missed the heart and soul of a modern cinematic masterpiece.  Yes, this is another film based around the 1970's where war, weed and free love were at their most abundant and yes this is another film based around the Vietnam chronicles but embedded within you will not find the cliches served to the viewers so richly in films such as Platoon and Full Metal Jacket (though these films are also more than outstanding). There is no top of the pops 70's hits here; no amped up boys-to-men themes; no serious sex, drugs and rock-n-roll scenes to woo the emotionally and visually unintelligent; no, this film does not exist to insult your intelligence.  This is not another handbook to the life and times of a Vietnam soldier.  This is a narrative of a different kind of hell, with a different kind of hero.<br/><br/>The plot surrounds a group of young men faced with the most horrific of boot camps before they even hit the warfields of Vietnam, where they battle themselves, their leaders, and each other.  Standing boldly in the face of the unnrelenting authority figures is Roland Bozz, a young man from Texas who carries with him a higher regard for life than the war weary world is willing to offer him.  His in-your-face attitude doesn't hold him in strong stead with his fellow understudies but his constant defiance for a war that is not of his making and willingness to aid fellow soldiers in getting them out of their tour of duty brings him a hard earned respect.  He is made a constant example of by the harsh and brutal camp leaders but with a wry grin and never-ending petrol tank of courage and spirit he fights on to motivate and inspire his fellow squad members and eventually prevails, never conceding an inch to anyone, and therein lies the real secret to the heart of the film.<br/><br/>Director Joel Schumacher, who has seemingly been in hiding from his recent disasters (see the worst Batman flicks and the below par 8mm) has come back with a film so strikingly original in the current quagmire of bogged down Hollywood films you wish he was working with this kind of miniscule budget forever more.  Shot in a little under 28 days mostly with a hand held camera it is so easy to fall into the thought that this is a radical documentary. The wavering camera and sharp cuts instill in the film a lot of honesty and much credit must also go to cinematographer Matthew Libatique for the dark greys and general murkiness that the screen projects.<br/><br/>
Colin Farrel has staked himself here as the benchmark of actors wishing to be utterly mesmerising on debut.  When on screen, as he is 95% of the time, he commands total attention.  He carries this film from its opening minutes to its brave finale with such screen presence it is hard to cast ones mind back to find a lead actor that has been so overwhelmingly well cast, and indeed acted so well, for a role.<br/><br/>This film is an absolute must see and will utterly entrance you for the entirety of its 101 minute running time.

","Joel Schumacher has made a name for himself as a strictly hit-or-miss director over the years (case in point, the character accuracy of St. Elmo's Fire vs. the utter disappointment of Batman and Robin).  Tigerland is a movie that is a direct hit, but not because of its director: watch Tigerland to see the blossoming talent of Colin Farrell.<br/><br/>For those who have already seen Hart's War or Minority Report, it is no secret the budding talent of the Irish heart-throb.  However, if you want to see him before the media had really noticed him, make it a priority to watch this movie.  With an interesting supporting cast (Matthew Davis from Legally Blonde, Clifton Collins Jr. from Traffic, Tom Guiry from Black Hawk Down, and Cole Hauser from Higher Learning), Colin Farrell presents the character Bozz as only he could.  As a precursor, viewers should enter the movie with the understanding that it is somewhat of a political statement - anti-Vietnam War - but the meaning of the movie does not in any way hinder your enjoyment of Farrell's performance.<br/><br/>I am sure someone has said it before, but Colin Farrell WILL become the Tom Cruise of the early 21st century.  Tigerland will be to Farrell what Risky Business was to Cruise."

","I had figured every possible angle of the Vietnam War story had been done to death by now, but Joel Schumacher finds a fresh angle with this very solidly-realized film.  Schumacher's usual stylistic touches, seen in his previous ""Batman"" and ""Bad Company""-type films, are almost entirely absent; he seems to truly embrace the concept of tabula rasa with ""Tigerland."" (Well, except for frequent subtextual homoeroticism.  Although there are no gay characters (and no oversized codpieces, obviously), you'll see shirtless, underwear-clad or altogether-naked men frolicking in practically every other scene.)  Colin Farrell has a stunning Stateside debut in this film; one can easily see what prompted the likes of Steven Spielberg to snap him up for ""Minority Report.""

","Pros: Directing, acting, script.<br/><br/>Cons: A bit too grapic in some sex scenes, cliched characters.<br/><br/>Tigerland is Joel Schumacher's return from grace after the dismal Batman & Robin. Colin Farrell plays private Bozz who decides he will do anything to get kicked out of the army. No matter how hard he tries, he still doesn't get kicked out and even gets promoted. Tigerland generally follows a platoon through bootcamp. It brings back memories from the first part of Full Metal Jacket as the drill instructors are as hard as they come. Tigerland is important because it showed the feeling of frustration americans felt during the vietnam war. Buzz is a good soilder, even his superiors recognize it but he feels that the war is pointless and really just wants to be in Mexico.He becomes some sort of a hero to the squadron and he helps some of his counterparts escape the war, plus he makes a dangerous adversary while still in bootcamp. In the end, Bozz accepts his fate and would rather see himself die than see another person take his place. Joel essentially films this with a limited budjet so it feels like a homemade film.<br/><br/>Premise: Recruits go through basic training in infamous tigerland.<br/><br/>Tigerland was ignored by the Academy awards but was nominated for numerous Independent awards<br/><br/>Grade: 9/10 (One of the best vietnam flicks)."

","Some of the performances are strong.  I had major problems with the movie's credibility, though.  For instance, certain characters were not believable. The one sadistic drill sergeant was completely out of control, laughably so--kind of a cardboard version of the mean prison guard in The Shawshank Redemption, a much better film.  The caricatured drill sergeant in Tigerland contrasts sharply with the drill sergeant in Stanley Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket.""  The DI in that movie was the opposite of out-of-control.  In Tigerland, Sergeant Sadist's captain was a caricature as well.  These guys seem to serve merely as devices to establish the conflict that's supposed to drive the movie.  The idea of the insubordinate draftee who overthrows authority in boot camp is pretty hackneyed by now.  Lastly, I can't imagine someone like Bozz would have been able get away with this stuff and to leverage control over the unit as he does, through repeated insubordination. But what do I know?  I was never in the Army.  Still, I just don't buy it. I liked Schumacher's movie ""Falling Down"" much better."

"mcman","Null","0","0","13 March 2002"," Interesting and enjoyable
","I enjoyed this film. Most of my reasons for doing so have been<br/><br/>canvassed by other reviewers, so I'd like to add a few observations<br/><br/>of my own that I haven't read elsewhere.<br/><br/>Firstly, this didn't seem to me to be a film specifically about the<br/><br/>Vietnam War, though it is anti-war in the final analysis. I saw this<br/><br/>film as being about the brutalising at home of decent young men<br/><br/>by our military so as to create efficient, disciplined & uniformed<br/><br/>killers. The setting is 1971, but we it might just as well be 1941 or<br/><br/>2001, just as much a preface to ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""Black<br/><br/>Hawk Down"". Several of the characters in this ensemble piece do<br/><br/>not make it through the training; some manage to find the legal<br/><br/>means to opt out, while others are terminally warped by the vision<br/><br/>of cold humanity taught by their trainers.<br/><br/>Secondly, it seems to me to be also a film about the survival of<br/><br/>humane spirit despite this process. The lead character, Bozz,<br/><br/>knows how to escape, legally or otherwise, but he discovers a<br/><br/>reason for staying that has nothing to do with any flag-waving<br/><br/>notion of glory; but rather to share with and not shirk from whatever<br/><br/>might happen to his comrades, his fellow trainees. <br/><br/>Thirdly, the cast lacks a high-profile lead and this helps avoid any<br/><br/>of the characters being imbued with a star actor's personality. <br/><br/>This helps the film achieve its aim of allowing us to look<br/><br/>disinterestedly at this diverse group of young men, and observe<br/><br/>the different ways they react to training. The even distribution of so<br/><br/>many roles (as in ""Black Hawk Down"" or ""Gosford Park"" or<br/><br/>""Amelie""), incidentally, will hopefully help dispel Hollywood<br/><br/>scriptwriter William Goldman's strange theory that there can't be<br/><br/>more than 6 chief characters in any good script. <br/><br/>Fourthly, and finally, it intrigues me to see yet another example of a<br/><br/>non-native actor playing a character from another culture. Colin<br/><br/>Farrell possesses a George Clooney-like half-charm, half-cheekiness about him that endears him to the audience,<br/><br/>although I'm not sure how good a Texan identity his performance<br/><br/>might be. I don't doubt the talent and brilliance of Englishmen like<br/><br/>Tim Roth and Gary Oldman playing Americans, or Americans like<br/><br/>Renee Zellwegger and Julianne Moore playing Brits, or Australian<br/><br/>Cate Blanchett playing both, and similarly, Colin Farrell here; but<br/><br/>are we seeing the internationalising of character performances in<br/><br/>this most international of artforms? How differently would an<br/><br/>American actor such as Matthew McConaughey, for instance,  <br/><br/>have handled the scene in the mess kitchen? The sense of locale<br/><br/>that was significant in ""Fargo"" or ""The Straight Story"" can be lost by<br/><br/>a different casting choice. Every character ""lives"" in a specific place<br/><br/>and for an actor to take us, the audience, there needs more than<br/><br/>just a good accent."

","Director Schumacher gets on the war-movie bandwagon with the same, hand-held, choppy-frame visual style that seems to be par for the course when Hollywood deals with gunfire or battle.  What you get here is a contemporary look at Army boot camp and how it prepares the surplus population for battle.  The philosophical dialogue is tried and true, and the characters are literally plucked from Kubrick's definitive boot- camp movie, FULL METAL JACKET.  Many reviewers seem to be surprised by Schumacher's involvement with this project.  I imagine he wanted to give star Colin Farrell some big Hollywood exposure (if you know what I mean) because Farrell mainly comes across as cute and perky, a recruit presented as far more noble and intelligent than his predicament.

In fact, it seems difficult to believe he isn't a major star already. The running time is spot-on as well (don't you hate films that drag on needlessly?).

","Because he's give the American overrated hacks an excuse to call themselves artists, Spielberg and Mike Figgis jumped on the dogme-style bandwagon with Saving Private Ryan (1999) and Leaving Las Vegas (1996) respectably, now it's Batman and Robin ""helmer"" Joel Schumacher's turn to wield the hand-held camera. Now when Von Trier shoots in his typical, no glamour style that he made famous to the world with Breaking the Waves (1996) it comes off as a serious artist, trying to express himself in a new way, when Hollywood picks up on something it's purely because they can milk it's popularity and introduce something new to ""Joe Six-Pack"" and the family, then THEY look like the artist. Hollywood banality aside, Tigerland is a honourable attempt by Schumacher to shake off the backlash of the bat franchise and even the pompous 8mm, and to be honest he doesn't do that bad a job with it. If the film fails it's down to the script, no matter how much Schumacher tries to inject his film with a documentary realism, the script keeps throwing us more of the same character clichÃ©s and overtly profound dialog that we've seen in a million other war movies over the years, most noticeably Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket (1987). Tigerland resembles the first half of Full Metal Jacket almost identically; we have the typical cast of characters (Likable rough, tough drill-sergeant, trouble maker). But whereas Full Metal Jacket devoted only thirty minutes of it's running time to it's ""Paris Island"" set scenes, Tigerland devotes almost as much time on basic training. Still, that said Tigerland isn't too bad a movie, to be completely honest it's pretty good and it shows Schumacher's willingness to grow as a director, and that he isn't afraid to take a risk.

","Im not a fan of war films as a rule, Full Metal Jacket I liked a lot, and platoon, and for different reasons Apocalypse Now and Casualties of War, but I wouldnt necessarily label the last two as war movies, it was more that they had a wartime setting.  The same I guess can be said of Tigerland, its not a war film, literally because its actually set in a boot camp, but more so its a tale of bravery and belief, of individuality, kindness and human spirit.  Which is not to say thats its in any way sentimental or nice, its as gritty as they come.<br/><br/>There is no glitzy photography here, no soldiers on their knees arms in the air as bullets pass through them or lush forests torn apart by human savagery. Just grainy camera work, sometimes moving so fast or in lighting so dark its hard to keep up with, raw powerfull acting from a cast of generally unknown young men and a kind of documentary feel to it.<br/><br/>
Joel Schumacher breaks all the rules he laid down in his previous movies and gives us something totally different, brutally honest in its damnation of the army and the way it tries to dehumanize its soldiers, very real feeling, and thought provoking and lacking completely in special effects.  Its often a very funny movie, but in the kind of dark humour often associated with such macabre subject matter.<br/><br/>Although It does bring up a lot of interesting ideas and really gets you questioning the morality of war - the main character outstandingly played by Farrel is an anti-war young draft who seems intent on breaking rank, pulling crazy stunts and generally upsetting every senior official in boot camp in protest at the war, more importantly Bozz just wants to stay alive.. not in the physical sense but the spiritual, he is determined not to become desensitized and machine-like as the rest of his platoon, and the story shows how Bozz's thirst for freedom and his belief in the human spirit affects those around him.<br/><br/>Its hard to ignore also that its just as good a piece of entertainment because it never gets boring or drawn out with set pieces and loud bangs as movies about vietnam often are.  So dont go assuming its one for the intellectuals and see it as a piece of entertainment as i did and even if it doesn't really impress and suprise you as it did me, you wont have lost anything in seeing it.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is haunting in the way that these kind of movies always are, and as ever its fitting. The photography is very good and really does give it that raw and real feel as i mentioned previously.<br/><br/>Where this movie really comes into its own is in the storyline and the acting.  A very strong script, and suprisingly in a done to death genre very original helps but the young actors really do give it their all too.  Colin Farrel is a name to watch out for his performance here is outstanding. Matthew Davies is also very good and Shea Whigham gives a plausible if not quite Brando performance as the platoon psychopath, driven mad with jealousy and rage before the war even begins.<br/><br/>I think this is another part of the story that provokes idea, we never actually see the recruits during the war, and somehow we know as bad as things are, theyre going to get even worse, and thats a very clever anti-war message wether intentional or not, because if the viewer is even remotely turned off by the idea of being dragged into war by their country by the end of the movie then the thought of what they havent seen and what is still to come will terrify them.<br/><br/>I recognise that a lot of films set out to make you think, and I believe thats a good thing, but when a film becomes too pretentious and second year college kids are talking about the hidden meaning and beauty of it all it kinda ruins the effect, (i know i know ive been saying how meaningfull this movie is, but this is just a review and i dont intend to base my life on it and i dont intend to try and impress people talking about it, im just going to tell them it was excellent :P). Thankfully this movie isnt like that at all.

Joel Schumacher previous work, especially 8MM, interested me enough to purchase it.<br/><br/> The narration is not consistent.  At the end, it becomes obvious that this is the memory of Private Paxton's memory of basic training in 1971. Early in the movie, Private Paxton becomes friends with Roland Bozz, played by Collin Farrel (soon to be a household name).  I thought I noticed an occasional Irish accent in Farrel, as he was playing a Texan, but otherwise he was great.<br/><br/> Bozz is a natural leader but had decided long before he was ever drafted that this war was wrong and no one should have to go.  To the drill seargents and conservatives of the day, he is a coward, communist, hippie. During boot camp, it turns out he is the guy you would trust with your life in battle.   It was a great contradiction:  Farrel's character is selflessness to his fellow trainees but he disdains authority (government, politicians, military).  In a different War, such WWII, private Bozz would have been a hero, probably dying while saving one of his brothers.  But in the early 1970s not everyone was on board with the cause."

Though it would be easy for the story to tread familiar water & implement stereotypical plot development (soldiers going crazy, racial infighting, horny hookers, etc.), none of it becomes obtrusive.  The cast is uniformly fine, tho most of the officers at boot camp are paper-thin cruel thugs. Nick Searcy, as a sly commanding officer & Cole Hauser, as the soldiers' no-nonsense instructor at Tigerland, stand out.<br/><br/>But the real star here is Farrell, who can do no wrong here.

Yes this is the man who bathed Matthew McConaughey in ""all hail the golden hues and locks of this boy from God"" light in ""A Time to Kill,"" but he also stood behind and pushed ""Queer as Folk"" to come to America.  So as reviled as the man is, he sometimes has both his heart, mind, and libido in the right place and makes a good film.<br/><br/>Such is the case with TIGERLAND.  It's a Vietnam movie that's NOT obsessed with war (take THAT Oliver Stone!).  It's more interested in people, a squadron going through boot camp and realistic training (in this ""Vietnam simulator"" called Tigerland, to be exact), confiding in each other, and earning respect and trust, if not exactly ""friendship.""  It's about authority, and how those in authority are not necessarily BETTER than those they lead, and are often just doing their job the best they can.  And it's about the realism of what it takes for a man to be a soldier.  And through it all, thank GOD - it's about Matt Davis and Colin Farrel.<br/><br/>First, for those to whom this is good news - both men spend a good deal of the movie in either tank tops, white T-shirts, or completely nude.  Both have spend quality time getting to know gym equipment, and the result is very worthwhile.  Matt Davis proves again that he's got acting chops behind his rugged good looks, and turns in a very good performance.  But the winner at the end is a man named Colin Farrel, who might as well start practicing his upper end leading man salary negotiations now, because he's an amazing find.  He plays a Texan named Bozz, but his character isn't a one line write off - he's a rebel, yes, but he's also a patriot, a leader, a pacifist of sorts, a clown, a best friend, a confidant, an insubordinant, a jerk, a weasel, a lothario, and he's magnetic on screen.  Natural as all get out, charming to the point that he has charmed YOU by the time you're done with the movie, and extremely good looking, Farrel takes the movie, sticks it in his pocket, and walks away.  Without ruining anymore about what his character does for the others in his squad, I will tell you that I have never seen a war film that takes this particular view, and it's refreshing.<br/><br/>It's 90% handheld camera, and there are entire scenes that feel so natural they seem ad libbed.  Farrel owns the screen with his McConaughey drawl and rugged looks - and did I mention that fact that he is a stage actor from Ireland, so EVERYTHING that he comes across in this movie (from accent on) is a put on? - when I told my companion that, you could have knocked her over with a feather (so I did - it was funny - you never know when a feather will come in handy).<br/><br/>It's an excellent departure from what else is out there, and since it has not yet attracted much attention, I'd like to add my voice to the presently quiet grumblings of support for this fine attempt.<br/><br/>And that's my two cents."

","I wasn't expecting the highest calibre of film-making with Joel Schumacher directing this one, so I was surprised that TIGERLAND wasn't a complete waste of time.<br/><br/>In technique, it's often derivative of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN with the shaky camera work, grainy shots, the film occasionally running like it's skipping a sprocket---all those techniques Speilberg used to make his film seem more realistic but in the end was more distracting than anything else.<br/><br/>But unlike SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, the emotional component wasn't as weak, as the characters in this film seemed more like real people and the story less contrived, not so wrapped up in the American flag (Speilberg gets an 'F' in subtlety).<br/><br/>Next to the first section of Kubrick's FULL METAL JACKET, this is the most realistic portrayal of boot camp that I have seen in a film, and for that I think it's worth watching.<br/><br/>It's not a great film, but neither is it a bad film."

","I'm still scratching my head over the fact that this great, great movie was somehow directed by the same man responsible for the travesty that was _Batman and Robin_.  In fact, his entire career to this point has been rather lackluster.  But _Tigerland_ is, simply put, a revelation.  It is a film in the ""men go through bootcamp"" vein, but it is more than that.  There are more than a few similarities to Stanley Kubrick's _Full Metal Jacket_, but the film stays with the bootcamp experience and doesn't follow its characters to actual combat in Vietnam.  <br/><br/>Basically, we follow the story arc of a reluctant leader, Bozz (played by Colin Farrell), as he goes from platoon screw-up to respected leader.  Bozz is doing what he can to hold onto his sanity in the face of a system designed to turn him into a remorseless killer.  <br/><br/>Farrell is the standout in what is a largely unknown cast, but all the actors do solid work here and this is the sort of film where, I predict, we'll be seeing more of these actors in the years to come, the kind of film that introduces a solid new group of unknowns who go on to make names for themselves.  _Tigerland_ is a great film and one which will appeal to a wide range of audiences."

","There are four great movie depicting the Vietnam War.  They are (in no particular order:  Apocalypse Now, Born on the Fourth of July, Platoon, and finally Tigerland.  All but Tigerland focus on the actual war and the men in it.  Tigerland focuses on men in advanced training for the Vietnam War.  The character of Boz is one of the most important depictions of a man questioning war, and the absurdity of it.  This has been done in many war movies, but rarely in boot camp.  Also, this is a very complex character, whose method with dealing with his feeling and emotions are the driving force of this movie.  The character of Boz makes this movie so good.  It is a shame it did not get a major release.  It belongs on the shelf of any movie fan alongside the aforementioned movie titles."

","While this movie attempts to masquerade as another world-weary ""war is hell"" film, it's nothing more than a rehash of the hundreds of other movies just like it. You've got the guy who goes psycho in boot camp (""Full Metal Jacket""), the sadistic guy who only wants to kill (""Full Metal Jacket"", ""Platoon"", and even ""Universal Soldier""), and on and on.<br/><br/>
The performances are, for the most part, rather solid. But the whole project is undermined by the direction of Joel Schumacher, whose directorial style is blatant homo-erotica. If you've ever seen a Schumacher film, this shouldn't surprise you. It's the same story as ""Batman and Robin"" (hard rubber nipples, anyone?) or ""Apt Pupil"" (which added a new dimension of pedophilia to his style). If you get off on watching guys walk around naked, this is definitely your director."

","I was looking forward to seeing ""Tigerland"" because it was a smaller film that I had heard very good things about and though I enjoyed the way the film was shot and appreciated the performances delivered by many of the characters I thought that it totally misfired on the emotional level.<br/><br/>There was no feel to the characters and no development of them along the way.  Maybe I am looking for a cliche ""brotherhood"" between guys in the army that was too subtle for me to detect but Boz's unchanging attitude throughout the entire movie began to irritate me.  Every character seemed the same as the opening few scenes.  It seems that once placed in a situation that intense that some character changes would occur in the people involved.<br/><br/>The other question that puzzled me was if it was so easy for Boz to be a savior for the others involved then why was he still there?  It seems to me as someone said earlier that this was a Cool Hand Luke meets Full Metal Jacket hybrid but in Cool Hand the character had some sort of dignity and respect for himself and the others around him...in Tigerland he was just a jerk.<br/><br/>These issues perplex me so much that I wouldn't mind someone dropping me an e-mail if they can explain them to me."

","Tigerland follows the lives of a group of recently drafted men into the army who are called up to fight in Vietnam in 1971.<br/><br/>At this point, America knows they are fighting a loosing battle, and the director takes us through a 16mm handheld documentary shot film of the lives of several recruits in the 'Tigerland' training camp in Louisiana.<br/><br/>The film is more of a character study no real plot, but it focuses on a key character Roland Boz, who is a dissabordinate yet intelligent man, who only wants to escape the camp.  We are taken through several characters in the unit waiting for the story to unfold.<br/><br/>I'd have to say this is a great story about Vietnam and more importantly about the army in general..  Great acting, and very memorable.  Also the directors use of film and style works so well, cause it looks a lot like the old film footage you always see regarding Vietnam.  Its great to see how the film shows that all the infighting and problems were so significant to the problems of fighting this battle.  The particular scene where Boz walks away from a training mission where an instructor is showing how to use a radio as a torture device just about sums up everything about war in a nutshell... and it's futility.<br/><br/>Fantastic film.  Not just about Nam but about who individuals have to decide what is morally right by being 'in the army'.<br/><br/>Rating 9 out of 10."

I wish I would have known how boring this movie was going to be before turning it on. It was my mistake to think something was going to happen in this movie. It's just about a group of people going from one boot camp to another. The drill sargents treat the soldiers very badly and the main character tries to help people get out of fighting in Vietnam.<br/><br/>Okay, here is my rant about this movie: To me, this movie is slow and hard to watch. It was just one of those movies that you put in and are stuck watching because you want to turn it off but your hanging on to a string of hope that it might pick up towards the end. It doesn't.

","Tigerland is not much of a war movie. The plot could have been anything. Nothing really original. But somehow it's really deep.

I don't know what makes the script so good - I just know that without Colin Farrell it would have been a whole different movie.<br/><br/>This is a very good drama, and it is surely one you won't forget easily.

As a soldier myself alot of the themes rang true to me in my experience in the military - especially boot camp.

"SamRag","8","1","2","4 August 2002"," Before Vietnam there was also a war!
","Watching this film opened my eyes for another struggle that went on during the Vietnam War.  This is a story about the soldiers that know what is happening in Vietnam, and most of them want anything but to go there. Everyone has different story and different reason as to why they have found themselves in the final training camp (Tigerland) before they will be sent to Vietnam.  But many of them have one thing in common; they don't want to go. An unwilling leader, Buzz, finds himself affecting his fellow soldiers with his non-enthusiastic attitude towards going to Vietnam.  An unlikely hero amongst young men finding their way in this rather grim time, Buzz becomes their hero when discovering loopholes in their contracts which allows them to leave the army. The film is very well done, and every single actor was superb to watch.  If there is anything I can criticize about the film is that every soldier other than Buzz had a story and a reason, while Buzz himself remained this mysterious character, seemingly without reason or solid story. But maybe that was the point as we follow his story only during this training, and we don't really know what came before or after. A real eye-opener as to how not all soldiers were eager and stupidly wanting to fight in Vietnam, even though they were enlisted.  8/10"

","Well, like others, I was amazed that this was directed by Schumacher. The film really gave me a sense of how horrified and terrified and hysterical I would feel if I had to go to war. Farrell, in particular, did very well with both the accent and his performance. But the whole cast were excellent. I totally felt their panic and ever-increasing hysteria. And the worst thing about the story was that they never even showed the war. All that horror happened before they even got there.

"Easygoer10","9","1","3","2 November 2018"," Outstanding
","All things considered, it is an absolutely stunning film. The decision by director Joel Schumacher to use virtually unknown actors in the film was a genious move. It took a lot of courage, bot to mention skill, in training the actors in the platoon to train together. At least 6 of them have gone on to become exceptional actors, with Colin Farrell becoming a true Hollywood star. A couple of years later, Farrell was cast opposite Al Pacino (an actor he idolized in his youth) in ""The Recruit"". It was a successful film. Afterwards, Pacino said (a now oft repeated phrase) that Colin Farrell is tbe best actor of his generation. I agree 100%. Tigerland is a gritty, taut film, and blew me away the first time I saw it. By the way, my family home is about 45 miles from the real Tigerland in Louisiana, and yours truly came within an inch of being sent there during the Vietnam War"
"classicsoncall","8","1","3","31 October 2018"," ""Gentlemen, it's all about respect...""
","The strange thing about this film is that it's a movie about the Vietnam War without ever coming close to Vietnam. The environment at the Tigerland locale best approximated those of the depressingly tropical and swampy conditions of the war torn country of South Vietnam. Via the perspective of the military instructors, it's virtually a given that not only will everyone that goes through Tigerland ship off to the other side of the world, but that they probably wouldn't be coming back. If you go by the statistics of the war, that seems a bit unfair, as the fifty eight thousand soldiers who died in the conflict represented a little over two percent of the two million, seven hundred and ten thousand who served there. The stats were much worse for wounded and injured however, ratcheting up the casualty rate to about one in ten.<br/><br/>While attempting to demonstrate a single soldier's resolve to be as anti-authoritarian as possible, the story definitely serves as an anti-war film. Whether the brutality expressed and condoned by the superior officers was authentic or not, I would have to leave to the judgment of those who served at Fort Polk. Private Roland Bozz's one man mission to muster out as many of his fellow soldiers as possible appears to be his only recourse since his superior officers are dead set against filing a disciplinary charge that would result in a discharge, honorable or otherwise. With an unreadable personality and complete disregard for authority, Bozz cultivates friends and enemies within his platoon, which ultimately erupts into an all out personal war between himself and Private Wilson (Shea Whigham).<br/><br/>It's probably not too much of a stretch to consider that recruits like Private Miter (Clifton Collins Jr.) were all too common in the Army during this period. With little education and a conflicted home life, there was very little opportunity for someone with his kind of background to make a go of it in normal society. The film does a good job of bringing these dynamics to the fore, while demonstrating that war can be hell, even if you were half a world away from it."
"vhs1999","8","1","3","19 March 2008"," Colin Farrel does his best
","This was a good movie. It wasn't your typical war flick but something a bit different. This movie showed us recruits in training before the war and not actually fighting a war. This film is one of the more realist views on war and the army than most other films like this made. Colin Farrel did a great job at portraying an army recruit and Clifton Collins Jr and also Matthew Davis contributed reasonably well. Seeing Colin Farrel move from b grade to a grade in a few short years, You would never thought it would happen. I will also add that the makers of tigerland did a great job at filming a movie in the year 2000 and making it look like 1970 was a good touch. Its good to see talent used wisely and i hope to see this same talent again in the near future."
"johnnyboyz","8","1","3","8 January 2008"," Shot, written and acted in a way that is superb.
","In Joel Schumacher, you have one of the most inconsistent film makers of all time. But this is common knowledge; I think his main problem is the array of genres that he covers whilst at the same time, failing to develop any sort of certain style that might label him an auteur. Hitchcock liked his suspense and his horror/thriller; Chaplin liked his comedy; Scorsese likes his crime driven mafia stories amongst others and Spielberg likes his large scale, big budget adventure films that combine just enough violence for the adults and fun for the kids. Other more obscure examples include Kubrick and Welles who covered too much to write about here.<br/><br/>But Schumacher is the sort of guy who makes a flawed film revolving around a great idea or a really quite enjoyable film revolving around a seemingly dull premise. Falling Down had a great idea behind it but I found it flawed and anticlimactic with too many scenes seemingly relying on comedy. Batman is a superhero; superhero films have been big hits recently so how he managed to make not one but two appalling superhero films is beyond me. Then comes 8MM; a film with a basic premise that is executed in an impressive manner before Tigerland which is Schumacher's best film from what I've so far seen, in my opinion. With the war genre, laughter isn't something you'd associate with it for most of the time. I can remember scoffing at the absurdity of the D-Day landings during Saving Private Ryan: at the time when I first saw the film, I had not much knowledge of the Second World War bar when it began and finished. My eyebrows were up, my mouth slightly open with a weak 'I can't believe it smile' on my face. Needless to say, it was because of that film I searched out learning a bit more on what that event was all about and the war as a whole. In Tigerland, you are invited to laugh at the absurdity of war through Bozz (Farrell), a tough and egotistical soldier training for the Vietnam War.<br/><br/>But what's clever here is that there are no jaw dropping war scenes of fighting and death and destruction; just one man and his battle with the system for most of the time. The things he says and the audacity at which he deals with his predicament is reminiscent of a school child winding up a series of teachers at an extremely strict boarding school. Tigerland may borrow from Full Metal Jacket in the sense it is a training routine for the Vietnam War but egos and superegos play more of a part here, I think. The superegos that are the drill sergeants go up against Bozz whose ego is extremely large. There is also the third part of Freud's triangle that sneaks into Bozz: the ID. Compared to all the other soldiers who all have rather large egos, Bozz is the only one brave enough to show it in front of the sergeants thus suggesting he is allows what he shouldn't do to float to the surface and express itself: ""You are all dead in this situation!"" barks a sergeant. ""Any Questions?"" ""Yeah, if I'm dead how come I can ask a question?"" replies Bozz whose punishments such as push-ups and dirt eating seem to un-faze him in true ID style; that is he enjoys the punishments.<br/><br/>Also regarding the superegos, Bozz at one point tries to command a group of soldiers in field training. This is something the existing captain of the squad cannot do thus suggesting he is lacking in both the superego required for the job and the confidence to tell Bozz he is in charge. What follows is an actual conversation between Bozz and an existing drill sergeant who gives him his Christian name. This is where Private Wilson's (Whigham) character steps in: His uncontrollable rage and anger at Bozz explodes at certain time all culminating in the film's only real scenes of a shootout which is in the form of a training exercise in a river. Wilson cannot control his impulses and dislike toward Bozz and acts out.<br/><br/>What I also liked about Tigerland is that it's shot in such a way that is brave. While lacking in innovation, Tigerland seems to use lower grade film stock or lesser cameras to get across its gritty look. Make no mistake that this could have been a pretty looking film with lots of colour and attractiveness. But, we get a documentary approach in the final piece making everything look like it was shot on a typical everyday camera for TV; the emphasis on the hand held is also apparent but Schumacher is clever: he never allows the film to become too much like a mockumentry whilst at the same time suggesting the film's budget could've been half of what it was. It's worth saying here that Spielberg said he wanted Saving Private Ryan to look like actual reel footage or something along those lines and as if it was recorded from the war scenes.<br/><br/>While being very funny and entertaining, Tigerland is still a great study of what makes people tick; not necessarily in war but in the closest possible substitute. Its study on one man and how much he hates the system that he cannot even take it seriously is fascinating as is the drive of each soldier. There are several memorable scenes and situations culminating in a happy, if not unhappy ending that'll open your mind and make you think about what it's perhaps really like in the military."

","I was shocked by the ridiculously unbelievable plot of Tigerland. It was a liberal's fantasy of how the military should be. The dialogue was difficult to swallow along with the silly things Colin Farrell's character was allowed to get away with by his superior officers.<br/><br/>I kept thinking, ""Hey, there's a reason why boot camp is tough. It's supposed to condition soldiers for battle and turn them into one cohesive unit. There's no room for cocky attitudes and men who won't follow orders."" I was rooting for Bozz to get his butt kicked because he was such a danger to his fellow soldiers. I would not want to fight alongside someone like him in war because he was more concerned with people's feelings than with doing what was necessary to protect his unit.<br/><br/>--"
"dougdoepke","Null","1","4","11 September 2008"," Flawed
","This appears to be a message movie, but the message gets lost in an unsteady screenplay that can't seem to decide where it's going. Too bad, because the Boz character is fascinating, while several scenes are powerfully done. One problem is that the time and place is very specific, Fort Polk, 1971. By that time, the Vietnam war had become highly politicized even among rank and file soldiers, while peace symbols sprouted everywhere. The military was facing a growing mutiny as discipline was breaking down both at home and abroad.<br/><br/>Now the logical thing would be to connect Boz's rebelliousness to the anti-war movement. That would explain what otherwise remains vague-- his reasons for bucking the system. However, there are only passing references to the crisis then facing the military professionals. Thus, a very politicized period is de-politicized, leaving Boz's rebellion with a purely personal and unexplained attitude. <br/><br/>So, as the rather incredible ending shows and despite his previous behavior, Boz never had anything principled against the war or even the military (though he understands its de- humanizing methods). Instead, he responds to the demands of friendship (Paxton) and an unselfish desire not to have someone else risk death in his place. Thus, he emerges at the end as something of a mythologized Christ figure which is why the script leaves his fate so uncertain. As a result, what started out as a message movie ends rather confusingly as a character study. At the same time, the anti-military message morphs abruptly into a pro-war apology to the training sergeant-- a disastrous move for the film as a whole.<br/><br/>There's another shift that undercuts the cumulative impact. The original conflict is that between Boz and the army as he skirts regulations, disrespects his superiors, and returns recruits to civilian life who should be returned. But halfway through, the conflict morphs into a struggle between Boz and the unbalanced Wilson. The trouble is that this personal feud isolates the conflict causing the story to lose further focus such that no clear message or impact emerges at the end. This is a movie of parts, whose sum-total unfortunately undermines the whole.<br/><br/>I suspect the movie had either limited theatrical release or went right to cable. That's too bad, because with clearer concepts the result could have been memorable. Several of the scenes are really strong, especially the personal confessions. They're movingly done and by relatively unknown actors. Also the filming techniques (staging, camera set-ups, etc.) are excellent and help compensate for the muddled script. Unfortunately, however, they can't salvage the basic flaws in how the story develops."

","Well-filmed, but little else, TIGERLAND is another routine Army-training flick about some Texas recruits getting ready to be shipped off to Vietnam in 1971. Colin Farrell is the star, once again eager to show us all his vital organs during sex and shower scenes. What is it with this guy?<br/><br/>Overall the movie feels like Oliver Stone meets Martin Scorsese -- it's a rough little flick filmed on hand-held 16mm by Joel Schumacher (""Batman and Robin""). Once again Schumacher shows that he's best at handling rough human dramas (see ""Falling Down"" or ""Phone Booth"") -- unfortunately the material is so thin, and the actors and character so unlikable, that the movie is merely watchable and not very fascinating at all.<br/><br/>And be warned -- for a 98-minute film there's a hefty amount of sex, nudity and language. If you're a queasy viewer you might be offended. However I wanted to point out that it does not contain the ""F-word"" 527 times, as the IMDb trivia page points out. So far NIL IN THE MOUTH holds the record for the most swearing -- ever. Over 400 uses of the word...err...you know.<br/><br/>Anyway, a decent movie, well-made from a technical standpoint, but the story is so-so and the acting mediocre."

Unfortunately the film gets mired in a morass of negatives forsaking the positives, duty, honor, and courage, with no clear purpose, a nebulous plot, and a screenplay which quickly becomes a burr of macho vulgarities and one big cluser-f**k. Most likely to be appreciated by soldier-type mentalities."

","Colin Farrell stars in a film by Joel Schumacher. This is a large, talented cast composed mainly of men because it's a story about Infantry training specifically for Viet Nam, in an isolated U.S. location called ""Tigerland"". It reminds me of the first half of Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket"", which is also set in a training environment, and filled with stress. The story is driven by the interactions of the men, and their willingness or unwillingness to ""go with the program"". Most interesting is the complexity of the lead character ""Bozz"" (played by Farrell) who looks for trouble, causes lots of friction, brings excessive problems upon himself, yet manages to get many of the men behind him in a time when that war was no longer a ""gung ho"" effort. The look of the film is ""period documentary""  as though it was shot on 8mm film, stored in cans, and has discolored in various ways over the years. It also added ""other worldliness"" to the imagery."
"mustapha_wank","3","0","2","22 October 2005"," Mainstream rubbish masquerading as indie realism
","I watched this a few days ago, so details are getting hazy. The film is shot on hand-held cameras, and a lot was made of this at the time it was released originally, since we hadn't had many studio pictures made in this way. I can't help but feel this was more of a gimmick than anything, designed to make the audience think that what we are seeing on the screen hasn't had all the compromises that come with a big budget, and so was more ""real"". However what we have here isn't much more than a not-as-good rip off of the first half of Full Metal Jacket, so anyone who has seen that, or any one of the other rip offs there of, will know what to expect.<br/><br/>The main problem I had was the stereotyped characters, with the weedy soft kids out of their depth, close harmony singing, Ebonics spouting black dudes, world weary sergeants, bitter and twisted psychos etc etc... all being put into the sorts of situations that would provide the most friction and tension at any given time. Maybe this was intentional to highlight the stupidity and injustice of the situation, maybe it was laziness, or maybe it was just a committee trying to appeal to the biggest audience, all I know is it was annoying. One novel thing was the mixture of volunteers and draftees (where normally all the characters would have been forced into the situation,) although only the scenes between the two main characters really make much play of it. This seems to be the main pivot of the plot, with the volunteers coming to their senses and the draftees gaining a sense of duty and self worth, but its all done in a rather forced and unsubtle way. The other big bug I had was how all the characters (with the exception of the psychos and the real softies) would react to each inevitable conflict with at first aggression and threats of violence, faced with Farrell's ubiquitous stoicism, immediately back down and be all reasonable and diplomatic.<br/><br/>I guess if I had to find a plus it would be the acting from the two leads, which was strong and very convincing, tho considering the formulaic nature of the characters, this wasn't too hard.<br/><br/>In my imagination, Bozz grew up to be Zeke off Tour of Duty, and for my money, 4 episodes of that would be more fun to watch."
"Project_","8","0","1","4 October 2004"," Very different, very beautiful
","Colin Farrell delivers perhaps the best performance of his career as the trouble making but ultimately good willed Bozz, in what turns out to be one of the most different anti-war movies available. Beneath its incessant swearing and violence, it is a story about the struggle of one man who wants to stay in touch with his humanity. Coupled with a haunting and poignant drum beat in the background, Tigerland pushes its message against war by showing the dehumanising of soldiers and what is required of them, using Vietnam very effectively being perhaps the most morally problematic war of the last century.<br/><br/>In every other war movie, the soldiers themselves must be almost superhuman - life and death of themself and the men around them depend on it. They must think without morals, without remorse, about the actions they must take. Tigerland makes this point most blatantly with the declaration about guard duty by SFC Ezra Landers (Afemo Omilami) - ""You keep shooting till whatever made the noise is dead. I don't care if it is a woman, child or little Johnny next door"". Bozz is the draftee who tries to remain human by rebelling against the training and practically everything about the army, so try and get himself kicked out, because as he said himself, ""I'm not ready to go kill women and children.""<br/><br/>Tigerland clearly states it cause against war, showing graphically the violence both the officers and the soldiers inflict on each other. Portrayed directly and extremely opposite to Bozz's character is that of Private Wilson, who tries to epitomise in himself the 'soldiering' the army is trying to drill into the men - to kill without morals of remorse. However the story leads to a point where Wilson tries to kill because of his attempts are constantly undermined and scorned by the platoon, led by Bozz. Wilson is used clearly to show the mental instability of the way of the 'soldier' way of thinking, and the end of the movie, though perhaps slightly predictable, will leave a lot for people to think about.<br/><br/>Very poignant and beautifully filmed, the camera work and visuals of the film give a gritty and war-like feeling we've come to expect, and with great feeling Tigerland states simply and openly its intriguing cinematic look at war."

","'Tigerland' is an interesting movie. A lot of what we see looks familiar but most things are a little different. The movie is set in 1971 and we follow a group of soldiers that is about to go to Vietnam. One person seems to be a troublemaker. His name is Roland Bozz (Colin Farrell). Slowly we begin to realize that he is not a troublemaker to make trouble but he is one because he wants to live in his own life, he is against war and violence, he is actually very scared and he just wants to survive. Not only we realize it, the group of soldiers does that too and although some do not like him they do follow him when he becomes their platoon leader. One of the soldiers becomes a good friend, Jim Paxton (Matthew Davis). Another of them becomes his worst enemy, Private Wilson (Shea Whigham), and it looks like he really wants to kill Bozz. The last part of the movie is set on the infamous Tigerland, where the soldiers have their last week of heavy training. The scenes on Tigerland reminded me a lot of 'The Thin Red Line', especially the river where the climax is set.<br/><br/>All this probably sounds a little familiar but there are just little differences. In other movies Bozz would never make it to platoon leader. He had to prove himself in actual battle. Here they realize is a natural born leader and although they can't stand him they make him platoon leader, what is the best for the entire group. In another scene you expect that Bozz will get beaten up by one of his superiors, something that would happen in most other movies, but here Bozz asks for his superiors first name, he gives it, and they have a talk.<br/><br/>With mostly hand-held cameras the movie looks the way a story like should look. Colin Farrell, not very known when the movie was made, gives a very fine performance. The movie is not great but it is definitely good and interesting to watch."

","I grew up in the piney woods of Louisiana, just south of Ft Polk. In fact, my father actually worked there as a civilain many years ago. So that was part of why I was anxious to see TIGERLAND, a movie about US Army recruits receiving their final training at Ft Polk, ""Tigerland"", right before shipping out to Viet Nam in 1971. While it is a good, intense, unconventional look at war, I was disappointed that they filmed it in Florida.  I bought the ""budget"" DVD for under $6 US, and watched it last night. Very good film, if you don't mind foul language and some Amry training violence.<br/><br/>some SPOILERS follow, please do not read further if you have not seen TIGERLAND yet.<br/><br/>Bozz is the main protagonist, a young man from Texas, who has natural leadership qualities but doesn't believe in the war and simply wants to get out. He also helps some of his buddies get out.  This film looks in general at this rag-tag bunch of young men, boys really, who for the most part are law-abiding and patriotic but simply have no desire to go overseas and get killed. I suspect the characters depicted here are not too different from real recruits and draftees back in the early 1970s. I was draft age back then and I clearly recall hoping that I would not have to go.<br/><br/>The DVD is fairly basic, but good. The whole film was done on 16mm, and much of it hand-held, so you get a rather stark, grainy look to a full color film. However it seems to fit the subject well."

Another thing is that the standards for preparation for movies like this has risen and risen - the main protagonist looks like he doesn't know how to even hold a rifle. Lots of series have real military people prepare the actors (Daly Dye and his work for 84 Charlie Mopic, Tour Of Duty, etc. comes to mind) - I wonder whether this was the case for Tigerland. <br/><br/>Anyway, it didn't live up to the hype.

One thing should be appraised: the man has conserved a shred of good taste. I say this because ""Tigerland"" is the flipside of the spectacularity of Batman. It is a great war movie, with great dialogue, great actors (Colin Farrel should be a star now if this film wasn't such a low profile work), whose modesty and simplicity work to give it quality. We don't fall in political backdrops, we don't journey through complicated philosophies and thoughts. We just see how a charismatic soldier who doesn't give a damn to the military tactics and procedures manages to make enemies and friends in a situation such as the training to go the most deadly american war in history.

For those of you who have no idea who I'm talking about, he's the guy who directed Batman Forever and Batman and Robin, among other crap.  He's my least favorite direct.  I hate him.  But I love Tigerland.<br/><br/>Yes, it's true, Schumacher directed an independant movie, called Tigerland. It's is and it isn't a Vietnam movie.  It takes place during Vietnam, it's about Vietnam, but it doesn't take place IN Vietnam.  It takes place in Tigerland, a fierce boot camp where the army tries to simulate Vietnam the best they can.<br/><br/>This is one of the biggest surprises of the year.  Platoon was a personal story about the boys in Vietnam.  Apacolypse Now was a plot driven movie about the horror of Vietnam.  Platoon was about character, apacolypse Now was about Atmosphere.  Tigerland has more in common with Platoon.<br/><br/>Honostly, as much as I love this movie, I hate the way it was shot.  The camera jerks around too much and none of the takes are more than three seconds long.  I hate it when people do that.  I am not a fan of handheld shots.  Why don't they have long, swooping shots any more?  Is there a steady-cam strike I didn't hear about?  Joel Schumacher is a horrible director.  It's a good thing he got GREAT talent to act the movie and the script is tip top.  I also like how the film has a kind of faided yellow tint to it that makes it look like a documentary from Vietnam.<br/><br/>This is a real HUMAN story about a man who hates the army and wants out, while helping others to their freedom on his way.  This year has been pretty absent of any character movies.  We've seen mostly big budget, special effect crap.  But I really want you to see this movie, all of you.  I loved it.

The characters are well-etched and this film has a gritty realism that is lacking sometimes in classics such as Platoon.
