"FZ-FX","9","328","416","1 April 2005"," Brilliant, stunning and disturbingly entertaining
","Few films are as sensational or infamous as Stanley Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange"". It's impossible to sit through ACO and not have a reaction; whether it be shock, disgust or amazement. The savage tale of a brutal young droog and his subsequent ""reformation"" by the government is as shocking and thought-provoking as ever. <br/><br/>While the film's depictions of violence and sex are what it's most known for, ACO works on far deeper levels. The disturbing portrayal of youth and its satirical depiction of a government's attempts to create a better society are brilliant, but the most fascinating aspect of ACO is the questions it poses about good and evil. While the crimes Alex commits at the beginning of the film are atrocious, what the government does to him is worse. The film presents the absolute worst aspects of man, but shows that even these are still favorable to a man without the choice. People can denounce the film because of its brutal content, but the importance of the questions it poses can't be denied. <br/><br/>Equally excellent to the film's content is the effort by the crew. Kubrick's perfectionism pays off well, as ACO in one of his most visually striking films. Malcolm MacDowell is nothing short of amazing as Alex. Kubrick's use of surreal imagery and set pieces, as well as the ingenious use of music to compliment the on-screen action, creates a world that perfectly reflects the protagonist's behavior and the government's policies. <br/><br/>A Clockwork Orange is by no means an easy film to get through, as many will be turned off by the scenes of violence and rape. But this masterpiece is far more complex than a simple romp through a world of youthful violence. It's a rare example of film-making that demands that the viewer actually think. Real horrorshow all around, Oh my brothers."
"Agent10","10","646","854","28 April 2002"," One of those films you have to watch multiple times
","It's hard to judge a film such as this. Its cold and hard, yet can be exhilarating and sarcastic. It can be average, yet it can be visionary. Exploitive? Satirical? Too many questions to consider when one watches this film.<br/><br/>Even after 34 years, this film still speaks volumes about our current culture, which many ideals are ringing true today. The younger generations are out of control due to lack of parental control, junk culture is becoming commonplace, violence is desensitizing the masses, and we all seem to be enjoying the ride on the way down. It's very difficult to find movies which can make such startling commentary, yet hold on to such accusations for an extended period of time. Nowadays, films are focused-grouped to death, conformity is more powerful than artistry, and money is far more important than quality. Kubrick took a huge leap with this film, challenging society to take a hard look at itself. Unfortunately, society wasn't ready for this film, which is why it is revered now more than ever."

"varun_iitian","Null","291","407","28 July 2004"," Great Piece of Art
","I would say that the movie is really a gem of an art piece. The use of excellent imagery coupled with pretty out-of-the-place background score tells us about the uniqueness of this movie. Stanley Kubrick has really applied a lot of thought into this.<br/><br/>The director wants the audience to feel something as bad not because he is showing it as bad but because it really is bad. The background music accompanying the ultra violent scenes is comical, and not dramatic or anything else that is commonly associated with such scenes. This gives the viewer an opportunity to feel the bitterness not because the music hints so but because he himself feels so. Viewer's emotions should arise irrespective of what the director is trying to show, and this is one of the greatest successes of the movie.<br/><br/>Another glorifying feature is the central idea of the movie. If a human is striped of the choice to choose from good and evil, he no longer remains a human, he becomes a clockwork. When Alex is brain-washed and ""programmed"" to choose only good, he wasn't accepted by the society and this shows the irony in the objectives of the British Government. The word Orange from the title presumably comes from the word ""Ourange"" that loosely means man. And hence the title is so appropriate to the movie.<br/><br/>The artificiality in dialogues and sets give the movie a unique feature and enhance the grip on it. This also means that the viewer has to get more involved. This is definitely one of the best technically shot movies, another masterpiece of Kubrick like the Space Oddessey.<br/><br/>For the uninitiated, set in near future Britain, the movie shows Malcom MacDowell as the head of a group of youngsters involved in sexual violence. Turn of the events leave the protagonist in the hands of the police. Worried by the growing number of prisoners the British Government devises a method of ""programming"" them so that they always choose the good. Alex is chosen as one of those on which the new system is to be tested. The rest unfolds as a saga of the very human characteristic.<br/><br/>Lastly, I would like to say that you may be compelled to leave the movie in between, but if you are watching it for art and cinematic experience, I recommend you to sit through."

"MovieAddict2016","10","197","274","25 February 2004"," One of Kubrick's best
","To say that the Alex character from Stanley Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange"" is unlikable is like saying the Manson family was sort of bad. He's not just unlikable; he's despicable, terrifying, sick, twisted, and ultimately a haunting embodiment of all our greatest realistic fears and worries. But Alex does not see himself as a sick person. The key to this is in his voice-over narrative.<br/><br/>Alex does not see himself as a pervert, just as we do not see our own flaws and Ramond Babbitt did not see his own autism. To us, we are all normal, which is a scary thought.<br/><br/>""A Clockwork Orange,"" which was originally released in 1973 after an appeal for an R rating (that was granted after originally being tagged as an X-rated motion picture), had been banned from Britain for close to thirty years. Most film fans in Europe will tell you that they had seen the movie on grainy bootleg videotapes years ago when they were young and curious.<br/><br/>But for those of us lucky enough to enjoy (or squirm through) ""A Clockwork Orange"" in its entire odd splendor, it is an experience you are likely to never forget. Its characters, its style, its subject matter, its explicit material--all of it combines to create a marvelous whole that will stay with you long after the credits stop rolling.<br/><br/>Essentially a tale focused on Alex's journeys in jail and his process of being re-submitted to the world after inhumane treatments to cure the evil out of him, ""A Clockwork Orange"" is indeed as offbeat as its title.<br/><br/>All tales of redemption involve characters that we gradually come to appreciate, or like, or--at the very least--learn to tolerate. Not ""A Clockwork Orange."" Our narrator remains the same throughout the movie, always an incarnation of everything wrong in today's modern world. He goes through no cleansing process and by the end of the film we like him less than we did at the beginning. That's daring."
"nycritic","10","99","136","6 November 2005"," Kubrick and the Art of Violence.
","Stanley Kubrick has a way of telling stories about violence without actually exploiting them, or going into exaggeration. In DR STRANGELOVE, OR HOW I STOPPED WORRYING AND LEARNED TO LOVE THE BOMB violence as war was discussed, overheard, never truly seen until the final reel when a flurry of atomic bombs exploded into bright mushrooms as the song ""We'll Meet Again"" lovingly played in the background. In 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY Hal-9000 terminates an entire crew in a most chilling way and all we see is a computer screen indicating the termination of life. Now, in A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, Kubrick actually brings a story about violence, and even then it is art directed within an inch of its life.<br/><br/>Alex DeLarge is the leader of a band of 'droogs' who move from location to location terrorizing their victims, putting them under outrageous acts of violence. When two of his 'droogs' refuse to follow Alex's path of destruction, he turns on them and beats them, until an act of reversal turns against Alex and he is brought down by the medical industry who decides to ""reform"" his heretofore sociopathic tendencies. One he is cured, an interesting chain of humiliating events that bring Alex even farther down ensue: he is, for example, now attacked by his very ex-mates, now policemen, and his ex-victims. Sometimes the cure is far worse than the illness. Karma is a bitch.<br/><br/>Kubrick has a particular way of visualizing his films. A CLOCKWORK ORANGE has a look and feel completely out of its time, closer to sometime in the future, and its torture sequence in which Alex is regenerated also looks straight out of a science fiction movie. However, this is not a science fiction film. It's actually quite difficult to categorize CLOCKWORK because it's something of a social satire, something of a drama, has comedic moments and deconstructs a musical for a horrifying rape sequence; however, its approach to the material gives it the feel of a hybrid out of time, out of place, but visually arresting and impossible to take for granted. It's this approach that makes the work the product of a master of direction -- it can be seen multiple times and every time a different perspective arises, and all one can be left with is with the notion that this is pure, ultra-modern cinema."
"ickyptang","10","386","566","29 February 2000"," Kubrick's best
","Stanely Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange"" is one of the first movies that proved that cinema can be the most enlightening and amazing art form around. Movies have always been a true love for me, but it wasn't until this film challenged me that I fell deeply in love.  The first viewing left me speechless, unable to describe how weird and terrible I felt.  I thought it was the film that left me in this mood, so of course that was the easy target to blame.  It was just a bad movie, overrated and stupid and a waste of time.  But upon further thought, I realised the film did exactly what it was supposed to.  It showed how the world can be a weird and horrible place, and how this young man who goes around torturing people and being a wicked person ultimately doesn't have to pay for what he does.  And it's funny too. So this film brilliantly satirises this world, showcasing pure evil and people who ordinarily do not perform such evil are forced to laugh and observe what we all hate to admit is the truth.  It's sick, but at the same time brilliant.  And when one gets down to the core, you can't really explain it.  It just is what it is.  It's real.  No one really sees it very often, but it is out there and everyone knows.  And no one does anything about it.  In essence, ""A Clockwork Orange"" is the ultimate satire, and one of the ultimate film experiences.  It's art, it's life, and in a funky way, it's entertaining."
"sol-","Null","189","280","3 January 2005"," My brief review of the film
","A disturbing but yet very beautiful piece of film-making, Kubrick has created the ultimate study of mind manipulation in this film. It is a protest against reform programs that take away freedom of a choice, and the message of the film in terms of paying for one's sins in all eternity is inescapable, evident to a large extent in the sardonic nature of the tale. Although set in the future, it hardly feels like it is, this being because the message of the film is overwhelmingly powerful and capable of applying to any age. The film has a number of possible hidden meanings to it  a feat equaled on scale only by Kubrick's former film '2001: A Space Odyssey'. Besides for the meaning behind the film, there are still the marks of a masterpiece. Kubrick's direction is superb alongside the good photography, capturing shadows and angles needed to establish tone. The editing is excellent too, done in a flashy, brainwashing style at times to have relevance to the film. The choice of cast is again inspirational, however the film achieves the most in terms of music. Kubrick manages to use one of the earliest forms of art, classical music, and give it an unforgettable style and importance in the film. It is truly a difficult task to explain what is so great about a film such as 'A Clockwork Orange'  it is maybe best explained by watching the film itself."

"ChrJahnsen","10","596","951","27 June 2001"," Best movie ever made
","A Clockwork Orange is the finest film that has ever been made, in my view. Stanley Kubrick has made so many masterpieces, and is by far the best director that ever graced our world. A Clockwork Orange is simply his finest hour!<br/><br/>The film grabs you and glues you to your seat from start to finish. Malcolm McDowell gives us a shining example of superior acting, and the movie is as perverted as any of Kubrick's masterpieces (and then some!). It contains horrifying violence, extreme emotions, perversity and weirdness at it's very worst. It all boils down to serve you a plethora of thoughts for you to take with you and contemplate, after the film ends.<br/><br/>However, with all the perversity bursting out of this film, you will probably NOT like this film the first time you see it. I know I didn't. Fortunately, I gave it a second chance, and thought: Hey, it was actually not bad at all. After the third time, I was lost for words.<br/><br/>After the fourth time, there was little doubt in my mind, that this was the finest film ever made, and regardless of how many great masterpieces I see, A Clockwork Orange still towers above them.

"tyson-hunsaker","8","29","39","31 January 2017"," A controversial and offensive masterpiece.
","Anyone looking to watch A Clockwork Orange might be wanting to revisit some of Stanley Kubrik's work and might be interested in studying this film. Those who have already seen this film tend to already have strong opinions regarding this dark sci-fi movie but for me, I approached this film recently to obtain an opinion for myself and study one of the great masters of cinema. <br/><br/>The fact that this film was regarded as one of the most controversial films ever made (rightfully so) sparked genuine curiosity to give this flick a full viewing and while I have large issues with the film, the experience as a whole was both satisfying and a learning experience. <br/><br/>This story centers on ""Alex"" our main protagonist and his gang of hoodlums set in a not so distant, dystopian Great Britain. The beginning portion unfolds Alex's dark and twisted soul as we watch him and his gang fight, rape, and kill. When he's eventually caught, he undergoes controversial ""treatment"" to be cured of his dark soul.<br/><br/>I first appreciated the inmate concepts of this story and the type of questions the story attempted to raise to the audience. Furthermore, much of the psychological ideologies surrounding freedom, choice, good vs evil, and selfishness were extremely thought-provoking. It had a way of making me feel self-exploratory despite the character's complete inability to relate with (hopefully) any viewer. <br/><br/>Performances were top notch; especially from the lead: Malcom McDowell. His performance felt so authentic there's never a single moment that feels fake or forced with his dark character. As always, Stanley Kubrick directs the hell out of this. His commanding and authoritative shooting style is apparent in every frame of the picture and he does a wonderful job at sucking the viewer into this terrible world to the point of enthrallment. <br/><br/>While all these positives make for a great movie-going experience and when Kubrick is at the director's helm not much can go wrong, the film's biggest downfall is indeed its controversy. Disturbing subject matter in this piece is indeed vital to the essence of the story but taking off the gloves when it comes to fighting, rape, and killing (especially the rape) make this so incredibly disturbing that it's difficult to muscle through. I found that A Clockwork Orange was not only offense because of its disturbing content, it was personally offensive in so many ways. Frankly, these extremely rare and offensive movie experiences are not quite the reason I enjoy films in the first place; stories can still be thought-provoking while not morally offend and damage the viewer internally. In addition, a viewer looking to study the work of Stanley Kubrick can still experience some of cinema's greatest and transcendent experiences without feeling like their conscience has blackened.<br/><br/>It's understandable that not everyone feels this way; just as stated before, opinions about this film are all across the board. As time has passed however, A Clockwork Orange has stood out has one of Kubrick's finest and has been adored by die-hard fans so much its fan base has grown over the years. <br/><br/>The best advice to give is to see it for yourself. Much like all other Kubrick films, relying on anyone's opinion won't help one bit. Seeing it and deciding for yourself is the best course of action. That being said, despite it's strong artistic merit, I wouldn't recommend seeing it simply because of the morally offensive and sickening content that most don't appreciate. Overall, it's been the hardest one to review in a long time because it's not a simple: see it or don't see it. There's much more to this picture than that. If you do decide to see it though, be warned and well prepared. If not, that's probably just fine too."
"Movie-12","10","189","295","18 September 1999"," The number one film of all time. **** out of ****
","A CLOCKWORK ORANGE (1971) ****<br/><br/>Starring: Malcolm McDowell, Patrick Magee, Michael Bates, Warren Clarke, and Adrienne Corri Written and Directed by Stanley Kubrick   137 minutes    Rated R (for strong explicit sexual content and rape, perverse nudity, brutal violence, and some language)<br/><br/>By Blake French:<br/><br/>	Stanley Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange"" holds the recent record of being the number one film of all time on my charts. The film is everything that you'll never want to watch. The scenes are disturbing, gut wrenching, mind twisting, and way over the top. In result, ""A  Clockwork Orange"" has the most powerful and overwhelming dramatic impact that I have ever experienced in a mainstream film. <br/><br/>	""A Clockwork Orange"" is the story of a young man named Alex DeLarge, who is, by day, a regular student who lives with his parents at home, but, by night, a homicidal rapist/killer with his accomplices who dress up like demented clowns at a bleak freak show. He and his buddies weasel their way into the happy homes housing innocent people by chanting the same deceiving phrase every night: they scream that their friend has been critically wounded in an accident near by--and plead to use their telephone to call for help.<br/><br/>For a few unfortunate souls, this devious trick proves to be successful in nature. One night, however, a woman known as ""The Cat Lady,"" refuses their plead, and calls the police in suspicion. Alex, being both smart and sneaky, somehow manages to break into this perverted woman's home, while his accomplices wait outside. Once indoors, a fight begins. A struggle featuring a sex toy owned by ""Cat Lady,"" one that not only causes panicked arousal, but also is featured as the weapon of her graphic and disturbing murder. Alex quickly flees the scene once the police sirens reach his shaky ears, but when he gets back to his pal's waiting outside, they return their experiences with him by bashing him over the head with a hard object, allowing their jumbled escape, but his certain demise.<br/><br/>
After the process of being sent to prison, Alex grows to learn to tell offices and guards what they like to hear. He reads the bible, is never involved with any major fights or complications, and almost volunteers for a new kind of experiment. An experiment so probationary it is still being tested and held under wraps. What it does, though a series of ""sessions,"" is cure a violent individual from his sickness; he will feel terrible pain if involved in any sort of violence after the medicine takes place.<br/><br/>The scenes involving the ""cure"" of Alex's disturbances are truly emotionally troublesome. They are so explicit and detailed that I myself felt tempted to look away from the screen at points. This is not a film for those who are prone to walk out of movies, those who are easily offended, or especially for those with week stomachs. This is the most grizzly enumerated film I have even screened, but it happens to be one of the most perfect and precise in message.  I definitely don't recommend the production to everyone, though. <br/><br/>The soundtrack to ""A Clockwork Orange"" is one of the most inspirational and spirited ones I have ever heard; right up there with the turns to ""The Graduate"" (1967). Although the actual music is far from fitting each individual scene, the overall presence is not only worth listening to, but also worth the purchase price.<br/><br/>Here, a young Malcolm McDowell explores the character of a lifetime with vivid imagination and tremendous description. His character fits him very well as an actor. Even though the character is meant to be despised, I couldn't help but to be very convinced and interested in his sick, demented, psychotic mind. Most of this is because of the flawless point of view the film contains, one that both provokes empathy and involvement. It investigates the mind of a killer, rapist, and a confused, somewhat harmless, adolescent--all existing in the same character. This is no doubt the character, and the performance, that inspired a generation.<br/><br/>As well as being a movie of violent and sexual repulsion, Stanley Kubrick's direction to ""A Clockwork Orange"" also forces us to investigate deep down in ourselves and chew on the idea of us being in the character's shoes. There is a scene in this movie that forces two parents to make a decision of a lifetime. After receiving the treatments he volunteered for, Alex returns to his household only to discover that the only mom and dad he's even known have rented his old room out to some strange college kid, who is said to have been there for them during many hard times--like a real son. His parents must make a choice: to throw their only son, who has suffered for years in turn for making others suffer, out of the house for good, or allow him to return with open arms trusting that he is ""cured.""

","'A Clockwork Orange' novel by Anthony Burgess has been beautifully and splendidly portrayed by Stanley Kubrick in his movie with the same name. It is a futuristic movie with Alex having the lead role, a gang-leader whose main interests are violence, rape and Beethoven.
The cinematography is brilliant, the acting superb, and the background score very much satisfying. The symmetrical and one-point perspective shots of Stanley Kubrick are on a whole new level. His photography and direction techniques are beyond comparison. The energetic Malcolm McDowell brings the character of Alex to life. At times, you hate him, at times you love him. At some point, you also feel pity for him. Malcolm's sophisticated and polite, and sometimes amusing manner is very much noticed and appreciated. The character development of Alex is very exciting and is also what makes this movie a success. The language which is used in this movie is called 'Nadsat'. It is difficult to understand this language (invented by Anthony Burgess) easily but that's what makes the movie more attractive.
Although being extremely violent and disturbing, this psychopathic thriller is absolutely a must watch for all fans of classical cinema. You should definitely watch this movie if you are looking for ""a bit of the old ultra-violence""."

I never get tired of seeing this movie. Why it remains so underappreciated (at least by ""casual"" movie viewers) is beyond me. Everything is great; acting, direction, cinematography, the sets, everything. <br/><br/>Something that I don't think anyone else commented on was the Russian motif. The names of the droogs (Alexander, George, Peter, and Dim...short for Dimitri) are decidedly Russian. The singer referenced in the record store, Johnny Zhivago, has obvious Russian overtones. The statement made by the Minister of the Interior about the ""peace-loving citizens"" is a direct reference to the name that Soviet government representatives applied to their people when talking about the Cold War. Red seems to stand out from other colors. And, of course, who could forget Nadsat, the Russian slang language? I wonder what Burgess and Kubrick were trying to suggest about the future of Ingsoc (those familiar with ""1984"" will understand)?"

"yaseminturkish","10","81","127","26 February 2003"," Academy Award nomination despite it's initial 'X' rating inspired fans along with Alex's sweet smile as he imagines the old in-out in the finale
","With the sudden death of Stanley Kubrick recently a part of my love for film died along with him as I recognized the unfortunate fact that there was no other director alive to closely heed the call for attention to detail and visceral content.  The thought of looking to Steven Spielberg for future answers was almost unbearable as I remembered that his originality often gives way to family fare (The Pinnochio finale of `Artificial Intelligence') in an attempt to pad his already overloaded wallet.  I thought about Sam Mendes and cringed as I remembered that for him art was a floating grocery bag with unclever teenagers clamoring around it in `American Beauty.'  No one could replace Stanley Kubrick and after the intitial tears I bought his boxed set and tried to make the best out of a bad situation.  And it was then that I rediscovered his greatest achievement `A Clockwork Orange.'<br/><br/>What inspired me to watch `A Clockwork Orange' all those years ago was initially it's `X' rating.  I knew that mom would have a fit and I had to see why it was so provocative.  For the better part of the 1970's it was also banned furthering my desire to see it.  I was surprised by the `X' rating until I witnessed the hilarious in-out rape scenes and was somewhat amazed at the blatancy and sheer delight of the slow-motion pummeling of his droogies by the sweet looking but awfully scary Alex De Large (Malcolm McDowell).  Upon further viewing a new love and passion grew for the film until I became part of the passionate cult that remains inspired by `A Clockwork Orange' more than any other films on the AFI Top 100 of all time list.<br/><br/>`A Clockwork Orange' was a very sad film for any lawmaker who adores social order and loathes freedom of speech in 1971.  The response of lawmakers who banned this critical statement on social order proved their fear by banning it almost immediately though it still managed an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture and Best Director and deservedly so.  Ironically, Kubrick's most original piece was a witty and insightful adaptation of the terrific Anthony Burgess novel.  I believe that Burgess would have loved what Kubrick did with it.  There were subtle changes and Alex ultimately failed to become a do-gooder in the film but it was all for the best.  You almost never like the movie more than the novel but this is a film where Kubrick works overtime to bring his imagination to the proceedings and the movie is better than the novel.<br/><br/>With every Kubrick film comes the feeling of eating Turkish food.  As a principle Turkish food can be presented with a taste that is somewhat unedible.  More importantly is the idea of presentation and the experience requires elegance and an amazing contrast of color.  This as opposed to taste makes for quality food.  Similarly, Kubrick often shied away from telling a fundamentally coherent plot and concerned himself with the details of visual artistry.  `A Clockwork Orange' was his best effort on the silver screen because he was able to finally incorporate a fantastic story with the elegant presentation of color, a task that surely kept him at night as he tossed and turned searching for a perfect balance of the two.<br/><br/>What truly makes this adaptation of the Burgess novel a success, is what Malcolm McDowell brings to the screen.  He is Alex De Large and you can't help but kind of adore his urgent needs for a little of the old ultra violence each night as he unexpectedly makes his house calls through the neighborhood and pounces on innocent women.  You also can't help but appreciate his interaction with his good old mom and dad as a tiny snicker forms when he insists on not being able to attend school and a sad but sweet look of confusion and sadness innocently appears as his parents introduce him to their replacement son and he finds himself homeless and in need of his droogies.  His interactions with his droogies are a delight as he goes from `singing in the rain' to a mad villain beating up the little groupies in slow-motion.  There is a sense of sadness as he ironically goes from being Beethoven's number one fan to a botched suicide that leaves him with broken limbs abounding but the same clever smile and good attitude.  The finale is quite possibly the best ever in cinema as sweet Alex cannot help but think of a little of the old in-out as the nurses attempt to curtail his ultra violent tendencies.  The slow smile that appears on his innocently despicable face is a sheer delight.  The incredible accent makes it all the better.<br/><br/>`A Clockwork Orange' was a film that was so far ahead of it's time in 1971. The Kordova Milk Bar was a trendy little place we can only picture existing in the future.  The fascinating way that his crime was dealt with could be the wave of the future should the capital punishment issue cause too much disagreement.  In short, a little of the old ultra violence is what propelled this film to high rankings and what will eventually allow all of us to allow our children to see it, once their 18 of course.<br/><br/>10/10"

","This is just possibly the most ""perfect"" movie ever made. There is no meaningless dialog; not a single extraneous character; and every plot twist is rational and reasonable. Not to mention a superb soundtrack. Because of the intense violence, particularly against women, it is a disturbing and difficult film to sit through. But if you care about the cinema, you must watch without interruption! Characters get what they deserve...in the beginning and at the climax.

"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","10","56","87","29 November 2004"," One of the greatest films ever made
","I haven't read the novel that this film is based upon, and I didn't know that much about it before I sat down to see it. I decided to see it after hearing pretty much nothing but praise for the film(in fact, the only negative comments I've ever heard about it is that it deviates too much from the original novel... which is something Kubrick was famous for) and because I immensely enjoyed The Shining and Kubrick's directorial style as seen in it. I must say, it's been quite a while since I saw something so full, spectacular, exhausting and powerful. From the very first frame to the very last... amazing. Kubrick's style is magnificent, his storytelling is among the best ever seen in cinema. With this film he truly captures the raw and pure qualities of violence. I don't think(well, I certainly don't hope) that anyone who ever has or ever will see this film confuses this as an ode or a tribute to violence... this is not, in any way, shape, or form glorifying violence or violent behavior. Quite the contrary, you might say. The film proves, once and for all, that violence spawns violence. Visually, the film is absolutely stunning. The angles, pans, tracking shots... fantastic work. The ideas presented in the film are more than enough to disturb and freak out any normal person... which is(at least part of) the point. If I mention the words 'eyes opened forcefully' you probably already know what I'm talking about, right? That famous sequence has been referenced, spoofed and talked about more times than just about any other visual impression in the history of cinema. The way everyone and everything turns at Alex after he's apparently cured... truly disturbing. I found a surprise at every change in scenery or even in immediate situation, especially in the latter part of the movie. The way society turns against Alex after he rejoins it, apparently a better man... one of the most 'true' and real cinematic truths ever told of humanity. We are beasts, we are what is commonly referred to as 'inhumane'... and Kubrick tells us this in a truly astonishing manner. The plot is very good. It deals with the main character of Alex, beautifully played by Malcolm McDowell, who loves 'a bit of the old ultra-violence'. He is incarcerated and offered a chance to be re-entered to society, after being 'cured' of his psychotic tendencies. The pacing is... well, hard to describe, really... it feels slow, the movie seems to move slowly... but it hardly drags at all. It's exhausting, not to mention hard to sit through, both due to the extreme content and the slowly moving plot, but it's all worth it. The point is pure genius. Pure Kubrick. The acting is flawless... and believe me, that is not a term I use lightly. Every single actor performs perfectly. The characters are perfectly written, credible in every scene and interesting. The cinematography is pure beauty... pure excellence. I've come to love Kubrick's visual style. His cuts of varying speed and intensity, his long takes when dealing with dialog... truly amazing. His use of music is astounding... the use of classical music is great and really adds to the ironic tone and the atmosphere, the mood of the film. This is truly a work of art, and an exhausting but truly worthwhile film. I haven't seen anything quite like it for a while... in fact, maybe I never have. I recommend this to any fan of Kubrick or intelligent theater. If you believe yourself to be perceptive and intelligent enough to understand the film on most or all of its levels(I don't claim to, not at all), or even on the most basic levels, such as theme and morale(which is what I understood of it) then you should, nay, then you *need* to see this film. Be prepared, though, it does contain quite a lot of disturbing themes and ideas, and is not in any way for the faint of heart. 10/10"

","""A Clockwork Orange"" is a one of a kind masterpiece. It's odd, intelligent, funny and sickening. Kubrick at his best!<br/><br/>The opening sequence in the milk bar might very well be the best and most well known opening in cinema history. The movie manages to stay strong throughout the whole movie after the opening and only gets better and never weakens for a bit. Every minute is a pleasure to watch because the movie never gets predictable in anyway and the oddness level of the movie makes it so that it will be always a surprise what will happen next and how it will happen.<br/><br/>Every scene is pure cinema brilliance. The cinematography, sets, costumes and music all contribute to this, they make the movie a true piece of art. But the true artist is Stanley Kubrick who deserves the most credit. There are countless memorable moments, in other words, watching this movie is an experience that you'll not easily forget.<br/><br/>The violent sequences are sickening, twisted, odd but also funny at the same time. The way they are filmed are unique and very artistic. It's violence in its purest form, it's violence at its best. It gives us a view in the the extreme violent twisted mind of the main character and how he struggles against society and how society struggles against him. The story sounds more complicated then it truly is. The movie itself is easy to follow but it are the layers and deeper meanings that makes this movie not easy if not impossible to explain.<br/><br/>In my experience it is always very hard to comment on a Kubrick movie mainly because his movies always have so many layers and deeper meanings than a single few hundred words comment can describe. It is best to just watch this movie and experience the brilliance of it that is not easy to describe or explain.<br/><br/>In my opinion the best movie ever made.<br/><br/>10/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","It's funny, after you watch a film many times you begin to fall in love with it. This is true with a lot of films but for Clockwork Orange, I only had to watch it 2 subsequent times to fall in love with it. There are so many elements of this film that bring it together and make you totally enjoy the story. The music in the film is one such example, at times it's beautiful and at times dark and disturbing, setting the right tone for the scene. Technically this is a sci-fi film because it does take place in the future and there is the plot which involves brainwashing. When many people think of Stanley Kubrick, they think of 2001 and this film. It's because this film stands out as possibly the scariest image of the near future"
"tfrizzell","Null","24","36","31 July 2000"," Sick and Disturbing, But Ultimately Brilliant
","Stanley Kubrick directed and co-wrote this wild and crazy film which deals with a murdering, stealing, and raping Malcolm  McDowell and his small gang of thugs in a not-too-distant future.  They are in London and by night they terrorize anyone and everyone who they want.  When McDowell is betrayed by his fellow mates, he is put into prison and is subjected to an experimental therapy which works wonders for the youth.  Now the thought or sight of violence is sickening to him.  He also grows sick of Beethoven's music, which he once loved, because of its use in the experiment.  When he is freed, he runs into all those who he crossed in his past and they all have revenge in mind for McDowell.  McDowell ultimately tries suicide to escape his life, he fails, and is then given a formal apology from the state and is reverted back to the way he was in the beginning.  ""A Clockwork Orange"" is ultimately sick and disturbing, but conveys some real strong messages in unconventional ways.  Kubrick shows that there are some solutions to various problems, but many times those solutions cause new problems that are just as nasty, if not more so, than the first set.  McDowell shines in his role. His character is basically the only three-dimensional person in the movie and it is meant to be that way.  The other characters are meant to be somewhat flat and under-developed to show just how alone McDowell is in his twisted world. Overall a great film and easily one of Kubrick's best.  5 stars out of 5."
"tedg","Null","33","52","30 July 2002"," The Eye and the Genital
","Spoiler herein.<br/><br/>Kubrick's films are misunderstood. Reading the professional reviews and comments here, one would think the reason for this film to exist is for Kubrick to make a strong satire. What bunk. What a small view.<br/><br/>This movie is about the tyranny of movies (and similar performances). The fact that so few people see it as something else is a testament to the self-protective nature of films in our soul.<br/><br/>The Droogs engage in performances. Their speech is theatrical. Their rival gang is discovered on the stage. There is a focus on the eye. They wear costumes. The sex with the teeniboppers is cast as a performance (and photographed that way). The accosted writer is (selfreferentially) the writer of the film, who incidentally drives the character to suicide by exposing him to a performance. During that attack, the Droogs act out another film.<br/><br/>The therapy is forcing `us' to watch movies precisely like the one we are watching. Kubrick follows the Film-within-the-film rule of having the distance of abstraction from the film with to the film be the same as from `real' life to the film. The entire film can be seen as (pick one): one of the punishment films; a subsequent vision in the hospital; a musical drama played out in some kid's head; a simple hallucination in the milk bar; a simple invention of the gay writer (who pretends he had a wife).<br/><br/>All of Kubrick's work starting with Lolita is an exploration into the plasticity of narrative, in the context of obsession (`Lolita'), war (Metal'), power , space (meaning the environment as in `Lyndon'), and invented reality (`2001') and adulterous fantasies (`Eyes'). Here we work with violent adolescent sex: cockworks. It is what Phil Dick had in mind.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation: 3 of 4: Worth watching."

"davidmvining","8","6","7","26 November 2019"," A great, but hard watch
","I've struggled a bit with this film more than any other Kubrick. The problem is that I think I get it too easily, or I don't get it at all. I'm never quite sure.<br/><br/>One thing's for sure, it's a hard watch at times. Kubrick, taking Anthony Burgess' novella and running with it, creates a main character so loathsome and charming all at once that it can create a certain dissonance in an audience (Roger Ebert's review of the original release is a fantastic example of a reviewer who simply could not see past Alex de Large as anything other than a celebration of antisocial behavior). The film jumps off the deep end from the very beginning, showing the audience Alex at his most primal and pure, an advocate of the good ultra-violence in charge of three droogs out to cause mayhem and pursue their own pleasures. So unburdened by any existing power structures at any level that Alex can simply get high, beat up other gangs, steal cars, break into houses, rob said houses, and rape women and just crawl back into the bed in his parents' apartment without so much as a serious question from an authority figure. He's not getting caught by the police, so he doesn't care and neither do his parents, so it seems.<br/><br/>The introduction of Alex's violence is interesting in its structure. The first incident involves the beating of an old drunk man. It's filmed in shadow to help hide the particulars of the violent act, but it shouldn't endear Alex to the audience. The second, I believe, has an unexpected and subtle effect on its audience. Seemingly just bored, Alex seeks out a rival gang. When he finds them, the other gang is in the process of trying to rape a woman, and in comes Alex whose presence allows the woman to escape. No matter what Alex's intention, one of the direct results of his actions is that a woman is saved from rape. I think there's an unconscious acknowledgement by much of the audience at that which pushes many of them to side with Alex. That is undercut, though, by the next sequence where Alex breaks into the country home, beats an old man (crippling him), and cutting off his wife's clothes (while singing ""Singin' in the Rain"" of course) and, implicitly, raping her. Alex is a monster, but in the middle of our long introduction to him where he intentionally does nothing good, he accidentally does something good. I suspect it has an effect on some people they don't really realize.<br/><br/>Anyway, Alex, dealing with some internal strife from his gang led by Georgie, ends up killing a woman and turned on by his mates. He's thrown in prison where, two years later, he is the chaplain's devout assistant. In fact, our introduction to Alex's settled life in prison doesn't really focus on him. The scene is focusing on the chaplain giving a sermon and some rowdy prisoners. Alex is off to the side, manning the projector for when they are to sing. Alex, though, hasn't changed at all. He's modified his external appearance, dressing well in his uniform and studying the Bible, but he only really likes the bits about blood and sex. In his mind, he's still the same depraved monster he was at the beginning.<br/><br/>He jumps at the idea of an experimental treatment that promises to get him out of prison early. The treatment is that famous bit where Alex is tied into a chair, his eyes pried open, and he watches horrible things on a cinema screen. Combined with an experimental drug, Alex grows sick at the ideas of three things: violence, sex, and Beethoven's 9th symphony. He's not happy with any of the three, but it's the loss of his beloved Beethoven that hits him the hardest. The very sound of the 9th makes Alex ill and unable to function. It's around these experimental treatments that the chaplain makes explicit (shockingly so in a Kubrick film) that what I consider to be the central idea, ""Goodness comes from within. Goodness is chosen. When a man cannot choose, he ceases to be a man.""<br/><br/>Alex can no longer chose to be bad. To a certain extent, he ceases to be human, and his return home after the successful demonstration of the treatment's effects help solidify this. His family want nothing to do with him. They've rented out his room and can't, for the sake of their boarder, let Alex move back in. Alex finds his former Droogs as police officers after the old man from the beginning of the film attacks Alex while he's incapacitated. The former Droogs nearly drown Alex as he's unable to fight. He's become so dehumanized that he can't even stand up for himself in any way. He ends up required to rely on the kindness of a stranger, the man whom he crippled and whose wife he raped. This man uses Alex's inability to take Beethoven's 9th symphony and drives him to a suicide attempt, casting himself out of the window.<br/><br/>Recovering in a hospital, we discover that Alex has been cured of his cure. He's right back to being the antisocial loathsome creature he started the film. The fantasy sequence that ends the film, showing Alex romping with a naked woman to a cheering, Victorian dressed, audience solidifies that.<br/><br/>So, is Kubrick saying that Alex's victory is being violent and psychopathic, as Ebert asserted nearly 50 years ago? No, I think Ebert missed the point. The point isn't that curing people of violence isn't a worthy goal, but that the cure needs to originate from within the person. Alex had to want to be changed, and he never wanted to change. He was always looking for ways out of his predicaments in order to get right on with the good ultra-violence. Forcing the change on him dehumanizes him. Better to do what the Chief Guard obviously thought best for Alex, locking him up forever, was probably a better fix.<br/><br/>So, that's a thousand words on the film's thematic exploration. After having written it, I feel like I have a greater grasp on the ideas of the film than before, so that's quite nice. I still think that A Clockwork Orange is a second tier Kubrick film, though. I've read the film as a black comedy for a while, and it can be quite funny through that lens. The performances require a certain special mention. I don't think anyone in the film is doing a straight performance. Everything is mannered to such odd degrees, and I love them all. Patrick Magee as Mr. Alexander, in particular, tickles me. It's so off-kilter and perfect for the world yet still so utterly bizarre as to be eminently watchable.<br/><br/>It's smart, but I don't think it looks as good as many of his other films. I feel like having the chaplain explicate the movie's central theme twice makes the ideas less interestingly presented. These are relatively minor complaints, but when comparing this to such films as 2001, Barry Lyndon, The Shining, Dr. Strangelove, or Eyes Wide Shut, I have to just say that A Clockwork Orange isn't as successful. Perhaps it will grow on me more with time, but I cannot imagine ever quite loving this movie as much as the listed others with a first act that makes me cringe so much. Yes, it's intentional and successful, but still...that's a hard watch."

I had not gone out of my way to watch any older movies that people had considered classics. I discovered this movie funny enough through the Tenacious D movie. They had an ""A Clockwork Orange"" movie reference within the film that my dad pointed out to me and not knowing what that was I googled it and discovered the film. Just by watching little clips of the movie on YouTube I was immediately in love with the genius cinematography of it all. I then for Christmas received a $25 gift card for Xbox and I spent $20 of it on ""A Clockwork Orange"". From start to finish of the film I experienced so much and absolutely loved everything about it. The movie is absolutely flawless in my eyes and I feel the same amount of joy watching it for the 100th time just as I did watching it for the 1st time. This was the movie to open the gate for me to going back and watching some older films or more serious films and realizing that Drama films are not just boring films that parents like to watch. I am forever thankful for this film for this exact reason and as I know this was not much of a review and more of just a dumb life story I still feel all Bias aside that this movie is pure genius and very much worth a 10/10."

The whole thing seems to be designed to appeal to base instincts through violence and sex without ever making any valid or thought provoking points about either these or any other issue. I realise it is in the top 250 list but personally I feel this film owes more to its notoriety (people thinking it was banned despite the fact it was actually willingly withdrawn by Kubrick in certain countries) than to any real merit in the film.

I already have a fascination with the criminal mind, and this movie allows you to dive deep down into a true criminal's mind and be erotically frightened.<br/><br/>*SPOILERS* First I must say that Malcolm McDowell was the absolute perfect choice to play Alex.  He was haunting, erotic, evil, and utterly bewildering.  You can see from the beginning, that even though his friends are also violent, he gets more of an erotic pleasure from feeding off of the fear of others and hurting them.  The use of Beethoven in this movie was genius and I personally love the Ninth.  The music he loved was shown as a corresponding parallel to his love for violence.  When he began to abhor the violence he so loved, he also began to hate the Ninth Symphony of Beethoven.  The movie is completely unpredictable, so you do not get anything you have seen before, even in this decade.  There are many movies about the criminal mind, but this one has to be the best."

The viewer is probably supposed to be saturated with disgust to the point that he/she realizes, oh my God, that's us! That's the worst part of a person in modern society, bla-bla-bla. Suppose, however, that you don't go along with this idea. What do you see then? You see an empty film. It is filled with violence that serves to get the oh-so-new idea of a social satire through.

One of the worst pointless movies I have ever seen. I fail to see why this movie seems to be regarded as fresh and groundbreaking. I must be honest and tell that I had a hard time just staying awake, thanks to dull characters and dark photography. The final 20min though do get better with a little suspense but by this time do we really care about what happens in the end? There are no fitting words to aptly describe how truly horrendous this crap was. I saw a commercial advertising this movie--- and that's when the laughter started. Just the commercial alone was enough to make me almost pee my pants laughing. This movie is so empty and vacuous it's hard even to comment. 90% of this film consists of people standing around talking, a lot of it shot outdoors in such darkness that you can't see much of anything. I was recommended this film by a friend who went on to tell me how ""brilliant"" and ""fantastic"" it was. Yeah, right. This is one of the worst adaptations of a book to ever be seen on film. I find it ironic that a film considered by some as 'stylish' is devoid of suspense, or any kind of visual flair... The directorial style seems to be simply point the camera and shoot. If you care one iota about plot, consistent and or logical character motivation, and pacing, avoid this never-ending series of outrageous vignettes masquerading as a movie. The idea of the movie is not bad in fact, but extremely bad acting and just simply horrible realization overcomes any possible good. I was desperate to watch a movie that day ... I didn't have anything else to watch ... but I preferred to stop in the middle and go stare at the wall. I about fell over laughing while reading the previous review!! Clearly a family member of the director, a cast member or the director himself wrote that overly detailed ALL HYPE review! In short-- DON'T WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ON PIECE OF CRAP MOVIES LIKE THIS ONE! DON'T be fooled by the HYPE MACHINE reviews!!!"

","The tale of a violent man (a boy in the book) and societies attempt to reform him.<br/><br/>Never before has so much junk been written about a low budget movie that fails on so many fronts. You can read quite a bit of this cheap sociologist gobbledegook  in the reviews that surround this one - in case you doubt my word!<br/><br/>Let us start with a few facts for a change: The film was made on the ultra cheap. Look at the lack of extras or expensive sets (all filming took place in real locations). Look at the cheap TV lighting. Look at the amount of hand held camera work. Warner Brothers didn't really want to make this movie, but Kubrick told them it would make pots of money and that won them over - in this he was right!<br/><br/>(To quote a Clash lyric: ""They wear smart suits. And think it's funny. Turning rebellion in to money..."")<br/><br/>Alex is living in a society we don't really see (in the movie at least). So how can we judge ""society values?"" Is Alex a one-off or common?  This is a society that sells penis-shaped ice-lollies to children so it must be a bit sick in the head, but no attempt is made to give the movie on-the-ground context.<br/><br/>Set in the future is it? Well it is a future that looks a lot like the year it was made right down to the trousers and haircuts. Maybe the future looks a lot like 1972!<br/><br/>I look for films to do two main things: To educate or to entertain. Clockwork Orange does neither. Many scenes are quite revolting - and bizarrely they are even found revolting by some of the  people who rate the movie highly!<br/><br/>I went to a rough house school that housed real football hooligans, rapists and sociopaths. Let me tell you now, they didn't like classical music or have the ability to explain their actions in clear language to anybody. Several were too stupid to even form sentences.<br/><br/>Having experienced/suffered the real thing why would I prefer to listen to the version of a highly protected/highly privileged  middle class man (Kubrick) who - in success - chose to live his life behind barbed wire, protected by big dogs and shotguns?<br/><br/>
I can stand rape and violence if it has a point to it, but here it doesn't. I am not surprised the original ""rape victim"" quit the movie, who would want to be portrayed on screen like that? Being held down and stripped, while someone with a bad comb-across tries to worm a hand held camera between your legs? <br/><br/>I don't attack Anthony Burgess's book (which I have read) because I think that is a valid exercise in literature. Not that it is that good or that original. Even AB admitted that the use of slang was borrowed from elsewhere.<br/><br/>I hate this film and the reasons that it was made. I also hate the people that make excuses for them. They should all be ashamed of themselves. Avoid at all costs."

Many more will probably want to watch this film to see what the hype is all about.<br/><br/>This movie is filth, drizzle, swill.. get my point?<br/><br/>Kubrick loves hate and violence, loves the overuse of sex.<br/><br/>So many people think he was a genius, and that this film was a masterpiece. I have just come to the conclusion that there are some people out there, well many, that cannot get enough violence, acts of hatred, acts of defiance, acts that are shocking. What empty lives these people must have. Then they try find how deep this movie is and the various deep meanings. THERE AREN'T ANY. It is a mess. Chaos.

","Stanley Kubrick wow! This film is extreme, that's what the first few scenes said to me. It's off-the-rails scenes work to create the appropriate shock value in the audience. And those scenes truly work, it provokes the audience, willing them to think about what they just witness. It makes you reflect. This is film. It gives you a glimpse to another view and sometimes that view depends on how you perceive the film. A Clockwork Orange is vividly original as a a film (I'm aware it's a book). This is more of a movie that you sit back and think about it and perhaps rewatch again one more time because you can't really wrap your head around everything in this film. It definitely challenges the limits of film. Yet, I think it works well as a stand-alone entertainment and perhaps you'll get a better idea to Kubrick's vision."
"Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187","10","5","6","16 April 2018"," A Clockwork Horror; of cinematic beauty.
","A Clockwork Orange was easily one of the 70s' most controversial movies and easily one of the most disturbed movies of all time; so much so that Kubrick actually withdrew the film from circulation in the UK until he passed away in 1999. That rarely happens to any film, especially to the type of film that the modern world would consider to be an astronomically important cinema-classic.<br/><br/>A Clockwork Orange is like the forbidden fruit of British-American cinema: it's risky beyond belief but the temptation is insatiable until you take the first bite. Risky, horrific, and psychologically demented yet absolutely beautiful in its depiction of a futuristic dystopia.<br/><br/>A film of its time, yet still completely relevant and disturbingly visceral today."
"gab-14712","10","5","6","18 October 2017"," My Personal Kubrick Favorite!
","Stanley Kubrick is back! And he brings with him another controversial albeit delightful movie. In the 1960's, he directed two genuine masterpieces in 1964's Dr. Strangelove and 1968's 2001: A Space Odyssey. Both were fascinating movies that had something to say-usually things that stirred the pot. In 1972, his most controversial movie of all was released titled A Clockwork Orange. I absolutely loved this film and I am not ashamed to admit it. I loved the film's take on a bleak, dystopian future reminiscent of a fascist society. I loved the characters in the film despite their ultra-violence. I loved the music and the use of Beethoven and Rossini. Just every little thing about this film can be called a masterpiece. There were people who despised this film because of it use of violence. The kind of violence displayed in the movie was something that was very, very rare in 1972. Even in today's standards, this film is violent. Maybe it even glorifies it, but its hard to say.<br/><br/>This film centers around a young man named Alex (Malcolm McDowell) who is a leader of a violent gang and to put it quite bluntly, a sadistic rapist. He is very violent to everyone, including his own gang members. One day, he murders a lonely old woman and is sent to prison for the crime. Whilst in prison, he hears of a program which would allow him to get back on the streets. This program is a form of aversion therapy-which would create goodness in him. He agrees to this controversial program and is released from prison after the procedure. Back on the streets, Alex finds it very hard to live a good life especially with all the violence he had a hand in creating.<br/><br/>One of the things I admire about Kubrick is how he doesn't rely on a huge cast and he is always trying to find fresh talent to work with. In this case, Malcolm McDowell is the newcomer here. I'm not really familiar with his works, but he does an impressive job in this film. He plays Alex as a very tortured individual who feels violence is necessary to make him feel happy. He also has a huge knack for sex-whether consensual or not. But towards the end after the aversion therapy, it's kind of hard not to feel bad for Alex. He wants to lead a good life, but his criminal past comes back to haunt him and there is really nothing he can do. Patrick Magee does a good job as Mr. Alexander, one of the victims of Alex's crimes. I also liked the use of the English vocabulary. This film has a very weird dialect, but it's delightful to listen to.<br/><br/>So you must be wondering what does this title stand for? Well, it has to do with one of the controversial topics in the movie. He goes under this psychology treatment under the totalitarian government to stop his immoral behavior. However, Alex is more or a less a robot after this treatment. This is one of the programs being instituted by the government to ensure total control over its citizens. To be a clockwork orange means you are an organic being on the outside, but on the inside you're just a machine. Kubrick himself called this movie a satire on such psychological programs. Nonetheless, this scene in the movie was a very hard scene to watch. It was well-done, but watching Alex break down to scenes of Nazi Germany was very intense.<br/><br/>Speaking of intense, most of the violence in this film is displayed at such high intensity. Some of the violence was even too much for me, and I have a very strong stomach. But the violence is necessary to show because its part of Alex's daily life. Kubrick took advantage of a changing studio system to insert this violence in his movie. He would not have been able to make the film as it is ten years earlier. But there are some crazy scenes to watch. The beginning of the movie has a crazy fight scene between Alex's gang and a rival gang. Alex and his buddies were beating the rival gang just for fun and showing no mercy. A very hard scene to watch is when Alex broke into Mr. Alexander's house and raped his wife. There was also an interesting scene where it shows Alex having sex with two women in fast-motion. It's not hard to see why this movie caused controversy. It's a very bloody, violent movie and I'm glad Kubrick didn't do any foolish edits to the film.<br/><br/>Music plays a big factor in the film. Early on, we understand Alex loves Beethoven. His ninth symphony is used throughout the film to great effect. Many of the fight scenes are set to the music of Beethoven or Rossini. Just like 2001: A Space Odyssey, Kubrick used music to speak to the audience. As with 2001, some of the music speaks louder than words. Also, this film brought an interest of Beethoven to me. He is a very good artist from the classical era.<br/><br/>A Clockwork Orange is a violent, brooding movie set in futuristic England and despite all of the controversy surrounding it, it is a very unique film. It is also one of my all-time favorites. It is fascinating to see how people or even nations were affected by the movie. Upon its release, this film was actually banned in the United Kingdom. They didn't get to see it for the first time until maybe fifteen years ago. Once again, Kubrick gave us another movie to challenge our minds and thoughts. He is a very meticulous director, but his efforts are worth it. Based on a popular novel by Anthony Burgess, A Clockwork Orange is a must-see as a visually-impressive futuristic movie about a man whose life is made out of violence. But that will be changed.<br/><br/>My Grade: A+"
"ccthemovieman-1","9","21","35","14 June 2006"," One-Of-A-Kind
","Friends are shocked when I tell them I find this movie fascinating and enjoy watching it every five years or so. They all think this is a very sick, shocking and just plain revolting movie. Hey, I understand that. When this film was released 35 years ago, it was highly controversial. Even though nudity is nothing new in films today, I suspect this story still shocks a lot of people. It isn't just the nudity but the carefree-sadistic attitude of the main character that is repulsive to many.<br/><br/>The vocabulary and the creepiness of lead actor Malcolm McDowell's character ""Alexander de Large"" is like nothing I have ever heard and seen on film. I play the DVD now with the subtitles on to understand all the strange words and expressions McDowell uses as he narrates this story. That dialog, too, is still unique and probably always will be. <br/><br/>A big attraction for me or the wild visuals. The outrageous colors in here from the clothing McDowell and his gang wore, to the futuristic house interiors and sets, are still something to see! I think this is director Stanley Kubrick's best work, cinematography-wise.<br/><br/>Yes, the violence is shocking but that sets up the main storyline: dealing with that kind of mentality (a sick thug with no apparent conscience). What ensues in the story is almost as disturbing - and thought-provoking - as the violence early on. After ""Alex"" is captured, he is a part of new experiment to cure violent and overly sexual tendencies. The scenes of his ""rehabililation"" are always easy to watch. He then returns to the street and is almost killed by his former victims who ""accidently"" run into him. Things get so bad Alex"" tries to kill himself, so the media gives him a big splash and they de-program him back to his normal sick self and the movie ends abruptly with Alex a happy man again. How twisted is that?? A rapist homicidal maniac is set free and the government is made to look stupid? Well, since this comes from Kubrick, that's not surprising. But, this film probably was interpreted in numerous ways and was an interesting discussion-starter.<br/><br/>In summary, a perverted story but the one-of-a-kind lead character, famous visuals and sets and interesting message always make this film watchable, but be warned: this is a brutal and often uncomfortable movie to watch."

","I watched this film on its original release, I also watched it a few days ago, I was hoping that with age it may have appealed to me more, but unfortunately it failed to hold my attention now, just as it failed to hold my attention way back then. The director has chosen to use graphic sex and violence to gloss over a bad script, feeble plot and mediocre acting. This film is remembered today for all of the wrong reasons. If looking at full frontal nudity is your thing, or unrealistic violence turns you on, then this film would probably appeal, but if you like a movie to entertain or to be thought provoking, I should give it a miss."

It is too violent and too disgusting; no wonder it was banned in the USA and other countries. I didn't even like Malcolm McDowell performance which was an OK at its best. I wouldn't say this movie is thoughtless but it is less thoughtful than most of Kubrick's movies .. to be honest the music was wonderful especially Beethoven's, there is good cinematography and there is some sign of brilliance in the picture, I mean visually but unfortunately all of that didn't do the movie any good.. in short, the movie is horrible and it celebrates the violence ..

","Someone needed to tape my eyes open just so I didn't fall asleep during this movie. If I could give this movie zero stars, I would, no let me take that back, if I could give this movie negative stars I would. The crux of the story is really a question, does being good count if you didn't choose to be good out of your own free will? Everything is quite blunt to the point of literally being stated. Everything is done to the extreme to emphasize the question. You can't just be kind of bad here, you have to be a raving psychotic killer and rapist, no nuance. The simplicity combined with the pacing made the movie quite boring. The question at the center of the movie also didn't fully sing since it is being asked about a psychopath - to me it didn't matter if his motivation for being good is the right one or if his free will has been taken away because his free will should be taken away by the prison system. He shouldn't be allowed back into society. And even what should be the purpose of prison isn't really explored, is it rehabilitation, punishment, or sequestering those unfit to live in society? The question at the heart of the movie would have been more interesting if it were asked about someone who is good only out of fear of say the law or God. Let me add, I know this is a book but I haven't read it. <br/><br/>Even without this next complaint, I didn't think the movie was good. This is why I would give it negative stars. What I really hated was how the violence towards women was presented. The rape scenes are quite graphic with out conveying the gravity of situation. They had too much of a light feel and the movie seemed to not just enjoy them at times but revel in them. The first rape scene of a woman just being tossed around as a group of men tear her clothes off verged on comical when it should have been repulsive. I just felt that rape was too serious an issue to be treated so lightly. Not to mention those horrible mannequins (which I could have lived with and maybe even appreciated if the actual women in the movie weren't also just props)? Being a morality play, women are only present as an object of violence. Edit: If you think I'm seeing something that isn't there, Kubrick said how Alex, the main character, ""represents the id, the savage repressed side of our nature which guiltlessly enjoys the pleasures of rape."""

","I watched A Clockwork Orange when I was a teenager, I absolutely hated this movie, watched it several times, couldn't get into it. The main reason being was the character Alex, it freaked me out so much that not only was I supposed to sympathize with a killer by that I could relate to him as a teenager. I had never been so disgusted by a movie at that time. A few years later as an adult I decided to give the movie another chance and I also divided myself from the character Alex trying to look at the film to see if there was anything I was missing since it's such a loved classic. I was completely wrong the first time that I viewed the film, this isn't about Alex, this film is about our society and it's absolutely brilliant. Decades later the film still shocks it's audience and conveys such a powerful message about how we as citizens consider ourselves to be civilized creatures, but when given the opportunity how quickly we could turn. Or how to take a brutal murderer, turn the things he loves most against him and wonder how we could feel for him? A Clockwork Orange is truly a remarkable story and deserves nothing but respect.<br/><br/>Alex DeLarge is the leader of his ""droogs"". One night, they engage in an evening of ""ultra-violence"", including beating an elderly man and fighting a rival gang. They steal a car, they drive to the country home of a writer, where they beat him to the point of crippling him. Alex then rapes his wife while singing ""Singin' in the Rain"". After the events of the night before, his droogs express discontent with Alex's petty crimes, demanding more equality and more high-yield thefts. Alex reasserts his leadership by attacking them and throwing them into a canal. That night, Alex invades the mansion of a wealthy woman . While his droogs remain at the front door, Alex bludgeons the woman with a statue. Hearing police sirens, Alex tries to run away, but is betrayed by his droogs. Dim smashes a pint bottle of milk across his face, leaving him stunned and bleeding. Two years into the sentence, the Minister arrives at the prison looking for volunteers for the Ludovico technique, an experimental therapy for rehabilitating criminals within two weeks; Alex readily volunteers. After the experiment supposedly works, he is let out back into society where all those who he has wronged are now given the chance to have another encounter with him. Only question is we think we're civilized could turn right back into the vicious animal that Alex was condemned for being himself.<br/><br/>A Clockwork Orange did something I never thought could happen, it turned into one of my favorite movies. Alex is one of the most despicable characters ever put onto the silver screen from a book, Malcolm McDowell delivers one of the best performance of his career and honestly when he passes, his work in A Clockwork Orange made his life worth while. Alex does bad because he just enjoys it, he's a teenager who takes being bad to the extreme, not just being disrespectful to his parents, but having sex, doing drugs, drinking, raping and killing. It's just disturbing that you could feel for him towards the end of the film but I think it's not only because of Malcolm's great performance but also because Alex is very intelligent, I think it's just that he's too smart for his own good. It's scary that also when he is given the chance to go back into society where he has destroyed so many lives, you want him to get on the right track despite his wrong doings. But as soon as he bumps into the people who he wronged, they turn on him so quickly and you understand why but at the same time want them to be the bigger person and forgive him. It's a hard movie to understand and watch, but is done with such class and style. A Clockwork Orange is a masterpiece and I'm so glad that I gave it the chance it deserved, it's an incredible film that will remain in the classics for years to come.<br/><br/>10/10."

What happens is that the victim then body switches backward and forward in time experiencing the torments of all the people in the film as real as life.<br/><br/>In my case, it didn't stop there.

And I believe it is one of the most disgusting films I ever saw. It is no doubt intended to be full of hidden significance, the grotesque manner in which characters speaks, move, dress, live. This is supposed to be ""new and frighteningly surrealistic"", a ""sharp, futuristic social satire"". The viewer is probably supposed to be saturated with disgust to the point that he/she realizes, oh my God, that's us! That's the worst part of a person in modern society. Suppose, however, that you don't go along with this idea. What do you see then? You see an empty film. It is filled with violence that serves to get the oh-so-new idea of a social satire through. Because, you see, without it the viewer won't understand. He won't understand the idea of mixing English with misused and twisted Russian words. He won't understand that the Music line is supposed to be thought-provoking and not just stupid: ah, Beethoven and the Nazi, Beauty and the Beast, whatever.

","What is the message? There is a lot of symbolism in here but it does not add up to anything. This movie is great technically it does not really fill this major void of what the message is. Is it to show how bad we are as people? I'm not to into that and pretty sure plenty of other people are like that too. This does not seem to be it either. I'm fine with negative movies just not this one. It makes you feel so horrible and use you get the feeling of what was the point of watching this movie in the first place.<br/><br/>The writing is good along with the cinematography which is great giving you the feeling of the chaos we call life. The music is very fitting and the directing is great with every scene showing something different. Kubick is the best in history at disguising a movie as a masterpiece, he has a long track record of it. Even the acting is pretty good at showing the insane world and characters. Malcom Macdowell is just perfect in here.<br/><br/>Still this is not enough for me. In order for a movie to be good it has to have some sort of a message. This movie seems to fail horribly at it. This is why we watch movies, to get something out of it. None of these great technical achievements really matter because of this. In order for the technical parts of a movie matter it needs to represent something and that does happen a lot except it does not add up to anything. This makes this movie very shallow rather that deep. What I can credit it for is that it does probably the best job of disguising itself as deep when there is really not much there. This movie feels as if Kubrick is just tying to just impress once again rather than deliver something meaningful."

","British TV-actor James Marcus,before having a good career in television (London's burning is the best example!)was(...back in 1971)playing one of the most memorable roles in the cult film,Oscar nominated,classic Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange...in which he played with great presence and solid acting style Georgie(one of the 4 Droogs). The way he played the character was so good and very convincing that many people believed he should have won an Award nomination as best actor in a supporting role;he played very straight and gave to his character a kind of cold and nasty air,,,very different from the one in the original Anthony Burgess novel;that's why he was considered great...he was able to change it completely and give to it his own type of personality and identity! Between the 4 Droogs,Malcolm McDowell(Alex),Warren Clarke(Dim),Michael Tarn(Pete)and him,Marcus played the most nasty character,the most hated...and if the result was so good it was basically due to his particular serious and solid acting and also(which was very determinating)to his extremely deep English accent(considered by many the strongest English accent in film history!). Marcus job in A Clockwork Orange was the best of his career and soon the actor was typecast. Since then,he played mainly in television in works of British production and also did directing,writing and producing for other films as well as working in comedies in London."

I can actually tell you about the ONLY time I watched it - it was when I was studying the art of film making. In class, the teacher told us we should watch it. Afterwards, our teacher said she actually likes the movie (like most people unfortunately do), but still, she told us this is NOT HOW YOU MAKE A MOVIE. That says it all.

"TheFinalAlias","9","16","28","11 July 2009"," A black comedy so black some will not see the comedy....
","I find it bizarre how so many great films from spat upon genres like horror and costumed heroes receive such vitriol from critics who enjoy BAD films in those categories but despise good ones, alway's their pathetic answer is the same: 'OMG The 'BATMAN & ROBIN' IZ BETTER DEN The 'DARK KNIGHT' BEKUZ IT DUZNT TAEK ITSELF SERIOUSLY LOL!' I fail to understand that argument. It's fine for a director to have a sense of humor and not be obnoxious about his craft, but there's a difference between having fun and not giving any effort by goofing off. Would you give some lazy student who sleeps through class who always comes in high and writes 'F- you' on a test as an answer an A+ because he doesn't take school seriously? If you give bad films like 'Batman & Robin' good ratings over 'The Dark Knight' because they 'Aren't serious' you are essentially doing the same thing. This filthy minded Liberal mentality has infected all aspects of film, with many excellent directors taking flack for the serious thematic content in their films.<br/><br/>Chief among these persecuted directors is the once-vaunted Stanley Kubrick, whose name is now used by these indie film fans and liberal canker sores as slang for 'pretentious' or 'overrated' or 'Taking himself too seriously'(one truly bizarre troll who sees the untalented Jason Friedberg as superior to Kubrick who I insulted sent me a string of hate mail telling me to orally pleasure him for weeks, that sums up the level of maturity of these people). What these disgusting people forget, however, is Kubrick's amazing range. He has directed romantic films, horror films, science fiction films, period melodramas, war films, but also comedies. Not only is he responsible for the famous comedy/satire 'Dr. Strangelove'(Which I will review along with another, more blatant comedy I feel is a spiritual descendant of 'Strangelove'), he has also infused even his grimmest films with humor('Full metal Jacket' has lots of black comedy in the suffering of 'Gomer Pyle' and in the Drill Seargent's over-the-top insults, and the famous 'Here's Johnny' sequence in 'The Shining'), but 'A Clockwork Orange' is perhaps his most biting speculative satire, and like I said, it's so grim many will fail to see the comedy.<br/><br/>The plot is simple, an obnoxious but intellectual young gang leader named Alex(Malcom McDowell in what is easily his best performance)commits the vilest of deeds, is betrayed by his cronies who are sick of his tyranny, and volunteers for a reformative treatment which makes things worse than before. And it encompasses all spectrum's of comedy, from slapstick, sexual innuendo, irony and social satire. The wonky imagery, along with it's bizarre but blatant sexual overtones, ridiculous outfits and classical music score smacks not of a Kubrick film, but a Ken Russel film on drugs. Alex isn't really that different than cartoon character's like Woody Woodpecker, Bugs Bunny, and in some cases Mickey Mouse, or silent comedians like Chaplin's Tramp. He antagonizes people in a stylized manner, makes a bunch of dumb cracks then suffers last minute. There's a big difference, though. Here, we SEE and FEEL him pay for his crimes, and are forced to consider what we as an audience have accepted and voyeuristicly participated in, and makes us feel guilty. If that was Kubrick's only purpose, the film would still be a masterpiece, but it's just his secondary purpose.<br/><br/>He explores just what happens when Alex is subjected to a 'cure' that will rob him of his violent impulses. It does rob him of his negative impulses, but it fails to make him 'good' so much as unresponsive, even when he needs those impulses. It also stops him from engaging in the only loves in his life that AREN'T destructive; his love of 'Ludwig Van', his neglected and manipulated, but still beloved parents and his pet snake(Symbolically representing his now circumcised manhood). For all of his crimes, his suffering is genuinely heartbreaking, AND WE STILL FEEL GUILTY ABOUT IT, since Alex is a character that we should have no reason to feel sorry for, but do anyway. One minute we are forced to be disgusted with liking him, then disgusted that we ever hated him. Brilliant, manipulative, but brilliant.<br/><br/>Beyond that, the film poses the disturbing question about 'reform' programs: If it is unjust to rob someone as disgusting and deserving of punishment as Alex of his free will, then how much worse is it to subject lesser criminals or the mentally ill to such treatment? In real life, those lesser criminals or the mentally ill would be subjected to such treatment, and someone like Alex wouldn't get the chance, thus meaning that the truly innocent suffer even MORE undeservedly than the guilty. And then there's the implication that it all comes undone and that Alex returns to his old ways. So that means that in real life, lesser criminals would suffer FOR NOTHING.<br/><br/>What a brilliant question to pose: If the guilty don't deserve it, who does? It's all a balancing act, social commentary, satire, horror, humor, but Kubrick makes it all work, and doesn't 'Take himself too seriously' for a second of it, unless you consider a rape scored to 'Singin' in the Rain' and women eager for an orgy sucking on phallic-shaped lollipops to be reverent and conservative and stuffy.<br/><br/>Try and make a film as rich as that, 'Care-free filmmakers'. I dare you.~"

","**gives away scenes in the movie**<br/><br/>This movie is one of my favorites. It really gets you into the mind of a psychopath and what makes him tick. Every scene of this movie shows just how his mind is set and what exactly he is after. He is violent and aggressive. To me the name of the movie really can say a lot about it. ''Clockwork'' meaning mechanical. When Alex is arrested he is then placed in a mental hospital where they basically brainwash him to be good. Well, what this movie really symbolizes is you can't play the role of God. Alex is being forced to be good when it's not in his nature. ''Orange'' actually represents a person. How their bright and can stand out. They're simply trying to take is individuality away. They're just trying to make him mechanical. After all the therapy and brainwashing he endures he realizes that every time he is exposed to violence he gets ill. And at a few other scenes in the movie you notice he gets ill from hearing Beethoven.(something he actually found beauty in) Which at some point drives him crazy and he attempts suicide. As he lays in the hospital and promises to keep what really happened secret it shows how he is no longer brainwashed. This is shown when they play Beethoven in the background and his sudden vision at the end. It also represents that you can never mold someone into what they are not. You can't change someone if they don't want to be changed. And in the words of the writer Anthony Burgess: ""What I was trying to say was that it is better to be bad of one's own free will than to be good through scientific brainwashing"" he also says ""When Alex has the power of choice, he chooses only violence. But, as his love of music shows, there are other areas of choice."""
"Infofreak","Null","11","18","20 February 2003"," Beethoven, black humour, sex, violence, they don't make 'em like this anymore! A movie milestone that still packs a punch.
","Kubrick's 'A Clockwork Orange' is one movie that is talked about more than it is watched, especially in Britain where it was banned for many years. One of the most notorious and controversial movies of the 1970s (a decade which also gave us such notorious and controversial movies as  'Taxi Driver', 'Salo', 'Straw Dogs', 'Last Tango In Paris', 'In The Realm Of The Senses' and 'Last House On The Left') it still packs a punch today. Don't just watch it because of its reputation. watch it because its a damn good movie. Kubrick was on top of his form here, and in my mind it ranks with 'Dr Strangelove' and 'The Killing' as his most successful work. Purists may whine about the changes to Anthony Burgess novel, which is indisputably a modern classic, but I think Kubrick's adaptation is as good as can be expected for the era in which it was made and the constraints of cinema (even now). Malcolm McDowell is superb as Alex, a brilliant performance which he will always be remembered by. In some scenes I was reminded of his Mick from Lindsay Anderson's 'If..'. While the two movies have no real connection it's interesting to compare McDowell's performances. The rest of the cast are also very good, especially Alex's droogs (actors largely unknown outside Britain), and cult favourite Patrick Magee ('Masque Of The Red Death') in a pivotal supporting role. I also got a kick out of Aubrey Morris' Deltoid. Morris is an interesting character most familiar to me for appearing in 'The Wicker Man' and trash classic 'Lifeforce'. 'A Clockwork Orange is a movie milestone that is as great now as it ever was. I have watched in many times and it never fails to deliver. One of the very best movies of the 1970s, which means it is one of the very best movies ever made. Highly recommended viewing."

","Something's probably bugged you about ""A Clockwork Orange"" and other films like it. You're not quite sure what it is, but it makes you mad. That's because you are witness to one of the greatest conspiracies of moviedom. Critics say Clockwork Orange is good. Film professors teach that Clockwork Orange is a masterpiece. Contentious artsy-fartsy students can't shut their silver spoon mouths about the brilliance that lies within Clockwork Orange. They do this about many, many horrid films, and we take it meekly, assuming that other people know something we don't.<br/><br/>That's a lie, 'cause I know it all. And A Clockwork Orange reeks. It's a lot like Impressionistic art: labeled as classy and innovative, yet it really makes no sense to anyone.<br/><br/>I tells it like it is. Here you have a film that has a really antagonistic subject Alex (Malcom McDowell) who revels in sex, violence, and talking in some sort of weird language that's most likely based on sounds emanating from 5-month-old tots. After some shocking, shocking acts of violence and rape (and CHECK OUT that phallic imagery, our film professors chime), the law catches up with Alex and throws him in jail. A bizarre experiment rehabilitates him to become nauseous at the mere thought of sex, violence, and Beethoven. From this point on, a large subtitle might as well be flashing ""SOCIAL COMMENTARY"" at the bottom of the screen.<br/><br/>My thought is, social commentary in movies is fossilized dinosaur dung sold at museums, unless shown with a spark of creativity. This is not the case. The plot turn is not more complicated than anything you've seen on a Happy Meal box. Think: What goes around comes around. Alex treats his friends badly. Later, they do the same to him. Alex tries to beat the system. Alex drinks milk. Blah, blah, blah. Kubrick revels in long, dry stretches of cinematic wasteland that has everyone barking that it's the best thing since Oprah started reading books. Open your eyes to the truth! It's just a few people bullying you into liking something that you haven't had the time to make up your own mind about! Free the people! Begin the revolution!"

"LDGerrits","10","4","5","4 June 2018"," A most unusual and disorienting movie experience
","Stanley Kubrick's ninth film, ""A Clockwork Orange,"" is a brilliant and dangerous work, but it is dangerous in a way that brilliant things sometimes are, because it is a movie of such manifold, contradictory effects that it can easily be seen in many ways and may well be wrongly used by a number of people who see it.<br/><br/>Although the film, like Anthony Burgess's novel from which it is adapted, is cast as futurist fiction, it is much more a satire on contemporary society than are most futurist works, all of which, if they are worth anything, are meaningful only in terms of the society that bred them. It may even be a mistake to describe the movie ""A Clockwork Orange"" as futurist in any respect, since its made-up teenage language, its dÃ©cor, its civil idiocies, its social chaos, or their equivalents, are already at hand, although it's still possible for most of the people to ignore a lot of them.<br/><br/>It seems to me that by describing horror with such elegance and beauty, Kubrick has created a very disorienting but human comedy, not warm and lovable, but a terrible sum- up of where the world is at. With all of man's potential for divinity through love, through his art and his music, this is what it has somehow boiled down to: a civil population terrorized by hoodlums, disconnected porno art, quick solutions to social problems, with the only ""hope"" for the future in the vicious Alex.<br/><br/>In my opinion, Kubrick has made a movie that exploits only the mystery and variety of human conduct. And because it refuses to use the emotions conventionally, demanding instead that we keep a constant, intellectual grip on things, it's a most unusual and disorienting movie experience. <br/><br/>10 out of 10."

It's visually impressive, boasts an awesome soundtrack and is full of great lines and interesting themes, all this while also being ridiculously entertaining.

Let's suppose for a minute that the protagonist was a female and little 'Jane' spent her nights sodomizing and castrating unsuspecting males, drawn to her beauty. Janie is just a little party girl, you see, who loves to have fun - she doesn't realize how bad she really is. We are supposed to sympathize, you see. When the terrible government tries to reeducate her, we should mourn for her passing.... Uh...yeah. Bet that some who think this movie is just nifty would have a different view if tables were turned. Personally I have a hard time with any movie portraying graphic violence against women posing as a movie that is trying to portray society in a meaningful way. The sets may have been futuristic at the time, but just look dated now; the constant camera angle looking down at the menacing face, becomes tiresome very quickly. It's as if the movie tries too hard to convince us of its uniqueness or artfulness, if you will. What a waste of time and money."
"stephanmj","1","35","74","18 February 2005"," Kubricks worst film
","This is without a doubt the worst Stanley Kubrick film I have ever seen. I am a big Kubrick fan, and amongst my favorite films of his are The Shinings, Full Metal Jacket and Barry Lyndon. Maybe the film is ruined already because I actually read the book first.<br/><br/>One of the main reasons Kubrick totally missed the ball with this movie, is because he forgot to include the last chapter of the book. This is the chapter where Alex grows up and becomes a man. This is like watching The Usual Suspects, but then switching it off 5 minutes before the end - you lose the entire point of the whole film.<br/><br/>Besides this major flub, the film is a poor rendition of the book. Like a lot of Kubrick films, it has a totally unrealistic feel to it. He composes the shots more like paintings than movie scenes - like in Barry Lyndon. People forget that Kubrick was initially a still photographer before he became a director, and I think it shows a lot in his work.<br/><br/>When I read the book, the world that Alex and his droogs lived in did not seem anything like the ""futuristic"" world Kubrick presents (complete with 1972 VW Beetles and 70's styled trucks). Instead of ultra-violence, we see much more of ultra-cheese. Which idiot made up the idea that Dim should repeat every word everyone says? That didn't happen in the book.<br/><br/>Kubrick has took the book and butchered it. Some reviews on here make it seem like Kubrick was the genius who came up with the concept, the idea for this great story. He just took a great story, snipped the ending, and made a rather silly movie that glorifies violence. I understand that this is a very ""in"" film to like, and there are probably many idiots who idol Alex and his droogs.<br/><br/>Overall, very poor work from Kubrick. Verges on downright cheese at times. Especially the shots of Alex with fangs in his mouth for no apparent reason. I give it 1 star."

"sharky_55","10","5","7","4 September 2015"," What's it going to be, eh?
","Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange applies a coat of comic absurdity to the ultra-violence of Alex and his droogs. It is more boisterous than Burgess' novel which masks the explicitness with Nadsat slang, which is much less prevalent in the film. The opening slow dolly away has his gang sprawled out in the Moldova milk bar, a innocent little front for a haven where drugged milk is dispensed out of a bound and chained female sculpture. The ornate mise en scène and the grandiose and imposing electronic Purcell piece create such a chaotic and chilling atmosphere in spite of the setting. Later, the gang ride in the Durango 95, the front two hunched over while the back two sit upright and serenade the wind of the night. Several vehicles swerve almost comically away to avoid a crash and I am reminded of a cartoonish style to the whole approach, green-screen and all. All it needs is some exaggerated sound effects when a car smashes into a wall, as if someone pushed over a whole shelf of percussion instruments in the same way Alex pushes over Mr Alexander's books in his hooliganism. And in that tunnel, the night is young and the lighting is low key and nightmarish, illuminating each savage blow but also distancing us from this dreadful act. Later it's revisited in broad daylight by the subdued Alex, and it's a telling contrast of his persona. <br/><br/>Malcolm McDowell's Alex is integral part of the film - he is a young man without a conventional moral framework and without direction, and he plays the hoodlum with a charm and dignified personality at times. His speech is theatrical and his charismatic persona that of a performance artist, accompanied by classical music. Kubrick's changes from the novel serve to accentuate this. The cat lady is morphed into a narcissistic, pretentious and needlessly aggressive character who parades erotic pieces of 'art' throughout her home and practises fetishised yoga. Alex mocks her in a dizzying hand-held and frenetic manner, giggling endlessly as he ridicules the phallic sculpture in an energetically charged crime. The rape of two young girls is changed to an act of sexual athletics, sped up rhythmically to an electric Rossini's William Tell Overture. <br/><br/>The world of Alex DeLarge is a decadent one - gangs brawl on decaying stages, police insert their own brand of brutality, social leaders and the opposition in turn fight over the people's vote and Alex as a social icon for change. The home of the DeLarge's is covered in semi-erotic art, the lurid coloured hair, makeup and dress of the mother reminiscent of a 'filthy old soomka'. Deltoid's visit to the residence has him show more affection to Alex than either of his parent's and hints at some childhood abuse. Alex's groans of pain in his hospital bed alternate with groans of pleasure of a nurse and doctor behind the curtain. The prison hymn admonishes individual aimless wandering and urges obedience to the shepherd's voice, another instance of symbolism. His faithful droogs receive a slow-motion assault for bringing up their own motivations and ideas against Alex's authority, and later repay the act with their own smashing of a milk bottle. Years later the pair assault Alex as policemen and the classical score is distorted by Walter Carlos with each hit of the baton, where the treatment and the absence of the Alex POV (the distorted worldview brought about by the use of wide angle lenses) suddenly strips the act of violence of its theatrical elements. What we witness is a world full of people obsessed with self-gratification and a desire to control others. <br/><br/>The hypocrisy of the state singles out Alex for the Ludovico technique, and his treatment is edited to doubly affect us as the audience as well. As the glorious Beethoven stirs from the speakers, we too witness the atrocities of the Naxi regime, the rapes, the beatings...never once shot to contextualise it as a medical experiment on a fictitious theatre screen but as a genuine part of the film reel. We cannot escape like Alex. The satirical element manifests in the character of the Minister of the Interior, a cultured man who enjoys Beethoven like Alex, and is so politically consumed that at the drop of a hat he will reverse his stance and openly encourage Alex's despicable lifestyle. If you may, Alex is the youth under control; a baby even (those delightful mannerisms where he opens his mouth agape to be fed by the Minister). He is a monstrous and morally reprehensible figure, yet easily enabled by the politician in a bid for publicity. On the other side you have Mr Alexander, tremendously well acted by Patrick Magee with his clipped speech patterns and trembling presence. He is long suffering and initially kind to an equally down trodden Alex, yet reveals himself to be a radically left wing activist who opposes the government's corruption and abusive methods. And again, he is shown to hypocritically take advantage of Alex himself in drugging and torturing him with Beethoven. <br/><br/>That final fantasy of Alex's is as surreal as his earlier ones; a determination in that whipping motion on Jesus of Nazareth, a blood-lusted Dracula, or surrounded by Egyptian slave girls. This time it's slowed down and appropriate too; he relishes in the sexual performance while a well-dressed classy crowd looks on and applauds with approval. Burgess' novel and Catholic Roots have Alex coming to a realisation of the pointless nature of his violent lifestyle and pondering a future and a family. That is problematic in proposing that Alex's delinquency will simply phase out. Kubrick's ending is a much more vivid and horrifying one; the world has given him free rein and will. What use is an orange if you peel back the organic layer and find a mechanic disposition?"

For a few minutes after seeing it, I was simply stunned, having no real idea of what to make of what I just saw. I had to view the DVD again, and then it all sunk in. And now, after many a views later, it ranks among my personal top 20.<br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick really achieved something here, something visionary and honestly hard to look at if you're really conservative or squeamish. Upon first viewing I watched it with my brother. The second time I watched it alone, but was nonetheless exhilarated. He creates what is supposed to be the future and a very unique and unparalleled vision of it. Yet it hauntingly doesn't look to different from our own, even today over 40 years since the film was released. Viewers are thrown in the midst of this world to meet the intriguing character of Alex DeLarge, played brilliantly by Malcolm McDowell. In a very graphic but all too real sense, Alex is ourselves, or friends, our enemies, the inner part of us that may be deemed wicked or unholy but undeniably human. There is a however a choice to be made, whether good or bad is entirely up to you alone. I suppose that very idea, admitting such a thing about one's self or humanity in general for that matter could turn someone off from this film. But it's really undeniable, ""A Clockwork Orange"" is not a metaphor of our world; it's as if Kubrick merely put up a mirror to reflect our own decadent society.<br/><br/>The pivotal point of this film is how pointless and rather how further degenerative it can really be to try and change human nature. And, as it is explored in this film, even if someone could manage to change it, is this man really even a man at all anymore? And before leaving you readers, I must write about one of the most mind-boggling parts of the whole the film to me, where Alex's view on the oh so precious Bible is shown, further insight to put an end to people diluting themselves. Not even a sacred book can change human nature, as Kubrick ingeniously shows."

","I love this film and the book it was based on. I personally this should have won the Oscars in 1972 instead of the French Connection. Stanley Kubrick is my favourite director and this film is a perfect example of his work, with good acting, an excellent story and great scenes and camera-work.<br/><br/>The story of the film is it is set in the near future and it follows Alex, a 15-year-old boy who with his gang, rob, rape, fight and randomly attack people. They are not the only ones who do this and the country is littered with gangs and the police and government had lost control. In Alex's gang there is a power struggle and after a robbery gone wrong he was betrayed and gets arrested for murder. In prison he gets picked to become involved in experiments to prevent from committing violence acts. He is injected with a solution that makes him feel sick when thinking about violence and continues until he doesn't need the injections to be sick. When released Alex has no problems to deal with, his parents had accepted a lodger, his ex-gang members are in the police and attack him and he ends up at the home of a man whom he attacked and raped his wife in-front of him. When the man discoveries Alex's wrongdoing against him he tries to drive Alex to suicide.<br/><br/>The themes of the film are the fears of youth running amok. The author of the book Anthony Burgess was influenced by the Mods and Rockers of the early 60s who attacked each other and in World War 2 when US troops raped and murdered his pregnant wife. Another theme was the idea of dyspotic society and this was done in two ways. Firstly was on the ground level because people lived in fear of young men and crime was ripe. Secondly is the role of the government, using mind control experiments, arresting political opposition and using violence law and order practises and using ex-gang members in the police. The other major theme of good and evil and whether it better to be forced to be good and have no free will and no self-defence or have free choice but use it to commit bad acts.<br/><br/>The film does make some changes from the novel, most are minor but I think some should have been added to the film. First in the novel Alex does outgrow his violence tendencies by the age of 21 and even fathered a child. However, Kubrick probably got it right going for the darker ended. Other things that could have added to the story of film could have been showing Alex with a group of other prisoners murdering a prison and that was why Alex ended up getting picked for the experiment and Alex getting raped by his ex-gang members after he is released from prison and see they were working for the police.<br/><br/>This film is a classic for me and would be in my top 5."

","Words would not do this film enough justice. It is a masterpiece for so many reasons. <br/><br/>First and foremost, the attention and detail with every scene and every frame of the movie is absolutely stunning. An excellent example would be the scene where the four hoodlums are in the restaurant/club after they have committed society's worst crimes. Whether it is the demeanor of the criminals, the decor of the restaurant, the patrons inside, or the dialogue, you get an understanding as to the type of director we are dealing with. This is what ""Art"" is all about: from start to finish it is relentless non-linear poetry. Something that goes beyond analysis and simply is. <br/><br/>'A Clockwork Orange' is both profound and simple at the same time. It's indeed a social statement, a political statement, a statement on human nature, and many of those other things. Yet it does not judge or categorize its politics in neat little boxes or dichotomies - of left and right or right and wrong. It does not give thanks or offer solutions to any of those things either. That is why it is so brilliant. It simply breathes with its own breath. You watch this and easily understand why Stanley Kubrick is mentioned as one of the top 5 directors of all time. This film would have to be in the top 10 films of all time.<br/><br/>Put this film into context (as you would all great films). If you were to watch this film in the 1950's (even though it wasn't made then), or 2050, it would have the exact same relevance. It's a timeless masterpiece. Definitely one of the finest films of all time!"

","This film not only amazed me with its diverse, beautiful, and sometimes ""strange"" art, it also made me think about the world, government, and human nature.<br/><br/>In many of Kubrick's films, he takes the audience through a journey of the human mind whether the character is ""good"" or ""evil"". Alex Delarge is not exactly a good guy. He rapes, murders, tortures, and manipulates. Though throughout the movie we feel pity for him. Kubrick makes you relate to Alex as he goes through his own journey with the government.<br/><br/>As I watched the film, I was scared for Alex, I didn't like the doctors who put him through the treatment, I didn't like his parents for basically kicking him out of the house. I found myself cheering for the bad guy. I was relating to him even though we have more differences than not.<br/><br/>That is the power of Kubrick, since the first time I saw the film it has been with me. Not only as an incredible art-form, but as a mirror of life.<br/><br/>The book along with the film isn't about Alex or the other droogs, it is about government. How they can manipulate us and drag us down but in the end buy us back. I was born in 1994 and saw the film in 2006, so I had the advantage of knowing what happened after 1971 and how the world/gov. has changed. When I ask people about the movie who originally saw it, they say they were shocked. Back then, most people didn't want to except that the world and people can sometimes be horrible. A Clockwork Orange wasn't a big shock as I was watching it because of the generation I am in, but I can understand how it was.<br/><br/>Regardless of who saw it or who will see it, the movie is for every generation. Alex could be anyone and it is simply a story of a man and his world. You don't have to go through his exact situation to relate, just be open minded. A lot of people look at the title or a poster and say the movie is trash without watching it. Unfortunately that's the world we live in.<br/><br/>But I can recommend this to people who like thought out stories and well acted movies. Malcolm Mcdowell was the perfect choice. He rips out every emotion in him leaving me on the edge of my seat wanting to jump through the screen and be right next to him in his story.<br/><br/>No movie will ever match the power of realism movies like A Clockwork Orange do. They show people how people are, and hopefully inspire people to change the world and make it better."

A Clockwork Orange has to be one of the worst films I have ever had to watch. The first twenty minutes were okay because it was not boring, then holy crap, the rest of the movie was flat out dreadful! I could not believe that this film got all great reviews. Do critics enjoy boring, non-psychological crap from the 70's? I guess so! There was honestly no point what so ever to this disgusting film.

To enjoy any aspect of this film you have to completely walk away from the concept that films should be enjoyed.<br/><br/>If when you pick up a movie, rather than popcorn, you prefer to buy a bag of broken stained glass from a orphanage window to eat while you watch it...than this is probably the show for you and ignore my post.<br/><br/>As for me, I like popcorn. And I like movies that are enjoyable on some level. Inspite of what appears to be a ton of movie critics want to tell you, this movie is not enjoyable, educational, or even deep.<br/><br/>First and foremost, it is long. Really long. Ridiculously long for as little as it ties to accomplish. And just when you think ""my god, this film has been on for a week and half, surely it has to be over soon,"" it keeps going. Of the six people who came to my house to watch this movie, I was the only one that didn't walk out.<br/><br/>Most of the aspects of why this film sucks have already been discussed at length. I will tell you why I hated it most.<br/><br/>It wasn't the violence, I can handle that. I found it poorly incorporated (which was remarkable as it is the primary focus of the entire film).<br/><br/>It wasn't the artsiness. I can usually enjoy that in films.<br/><br/>What bothered me most was after I watched this film, I read a ton of reviews and internet analysis of this movie thinking that there has to be more to this than what meets the eye.<br/><br/>There wasn't. I actually got it. <br/><br/>There was little depth to what this movie was trying to say other than the kiddie pool deep discussion of the definition of morality, conformity, and behavior that a 4th grader could have picked up on.<br/><br/>I am not anti-violence. I am not anti-creative. I am anti-worthless. And this movie is worthless in every level I can relate to you.<br/><br/>The only people who will like this movie are those stuck up, smarter than thou, I am so much deeper than you that I urne to find stuff the rest of the world hates, snobbish pricks who have no friends and probably work at the video store you rented this from."

","Kubrick got it all wrong.  the main problems with the movie were the tempo, the art direction, and most of all Kubrick's twisted obsessions and interpretations.  He may have been bound into the futuristic sixties-mod style, but it does not fit the book or subject matter.  The movie drags on and on and on at a snails pace, completely against the flow of action in the book.  And then there's Kubrick's own personal perversion.  He, if you've seen moer of his work, loves nudes.  everywhere you look in this movie there's nude paintings, and statues, and various impressionistic nudes and classical nudes and marble nude statues which pour drugged milk from the nipples.  though i am not opposed to nudity in various forms, it completely destroyed the purpose and mood and theme and everything that was good about the book.  and it was all so clean!  anyway, the movie hit rock bottom for me when instead of accidently killing an old woman with a small statue(like in the book), he crushed her head with a giant ceramic penis.  I cant tell you how the end was, i couldn't watch it all the way through and had to shut it off, i was that disgusted.  just read the book, dont bother with this horrible interpretation."

","A Clockwork Orange is one of those films that I first watched it, and didn't know what to think of it. But I decided to give it another look, and I ended up enjoying it. I don't love it like a lot of people do, but I think, despite it having disturbing moments, it is a solid and interesting film.<br/><br/>The film takes place in the future in England, and a young man named Alex (Malcom McDowell) leads his men, known as ""Droogs"" into doing terrible evil things such as killing and violating people while listening to Beethoven. One night, Alex kills a lady and gets betrayed by his Droogs, to where Alex is sent to jail. He then decides to go through this program that can cure him and his sentence will be reduced. As he gets out, he now becomes the victim of his victims and has to play it safe.<br/><br/>This film was pretty good, and I feel if I watch it more, I would probably like it even more. But after watching twice, I can say this film has a pretty logical and smooth plot, the acting is pretty good from everyone, mostly from Mr. McDowell himself, and the pacing went fast in a great timely matter.
Yes, the film can have disturbing and bizarre moments, thus why it was so controversial back in the day. But it's bizarre in an interesting way and not a silly stupid dumb way. I'd say it's like Silence of the Lambs kind of bizarre.<br/><br/>In conclusion, A Clockwork Orange is a pretty solid Stanley Kubrick film."

"DonaldDooD","2","9","16","21 July 2014"," By Using Two Extremes, Kubrick Fails to State Anything About Humanity
","Alex DeLarge is one of the most despicable characters ever portrayed in film. He steals, assaults, rapes, and kills without a second thought. He does not have psychotic charisma, nor does he have strong bonds with friends, family, or lovers. He's a true monster, with no positive human characteristics.<br/><br/>Which is a titanic flaw of the film. Alex DeLarge is not a human being. He is only a caricature, used to force a point. He is impossible to relate to, and isn't relevant to 99.99% of the population.<br/><br/>Yet we are to take him as some kind of tragic anti-hero? We are supposed to be terrified by his forced psychological conditioning? I don't buy it. Every scene in the film was evidence that Alex was not stable enough to be a productive member of society and would never change. If he wasn't mentally neutered, he would have only harmed more people until his untimely end. People may blather on how it robs Alex of his freedom of choice, how the government is even worse than Alex, but at the end of the day, they know which version they'd rather invite to dinner.<br/><br/>Honestly, this story could have been great if it allowed for some sense of moral ambiguity, some shreds of humanity to both the violent, rebellious Alex and the pathetic, shell-shocked Alex. It would make the government's actions far more questionable, and Alex's character far more dramatic. But as is, Alex reaps what he sows, but avoids true punishment through luck and politics.<br/><br/>The film wasn't lifelessly drab, so it keeps one more star. Stanley Kubrick knows where to point the camera, if nothing else. But its lack of realistic character makes any of its statements debunked before they reach the debate. Its the thinking man's exploitation film, and deserves as much respect."

The stare Alex gives the camera as it pans out is a classic image, one which promises much mayhem and extreme behaviour from the lead character. Unfortunately, i never quite got what i was looking for.<br/><br/>I was hoping to be shocked and left with some kind of feeling after the film, but all I was left with was a 'was that it?' <br/><br/>There were elements I enjoyed, namely the music score, which reminded me of the music from The Warriors in an early synth kind of way.<br/><br/>I also enjoyed the glee with which Malcolm McDowell sang 'singing in the rain' while punctuating the parts of the song by slapping and kicking his victims. But it isn't as menacing as it sounds. I was always well aware I was watching actors, and never for a moment became absorbed into any of the characters. However I think it was meant to be received in this way, to add to the 'dystopian society that doesn't care' message, which I get, but that just doesn't make for a very enjoyable film, thats why I would recommend people to read the book if you're looking to become absorbed in the character and the true meaning of the story. <br/><br/>I can understand how in 1971 this was considered a very disturbing film, but do not judge it by todays standards else you will be underwhelmed."

","A Clockwork Orange is a revolutionary motion picture. It was surely a very controversial piece of work back in the seventies and I can see how it would still be just as chilling if released today. I have not read the novel, but the film is extremely powerful and stands, to this day, as one of the best motion pictures of all time. Stanley Kubrick is an amazing director and, with a capable cast and some Beethoven tunes, he effectively turns A Clockwork Orange into a timeless work of art. The film is not watered down, nor is it for everyone. For those who can appreciate it, though, A Clockwork Orange is a true masterpiece that does not disappoint.<br/><br/>Alex DeLarge (Malcolm McDowell) is a young man intent on getting his way. In the undated future of England, he and his three ""droogs""  one of the many strange words he uses; this one referring to friends or cohorts  go out at night and terrorize to get what they need. The boys are content with drinking drugged milk at the Korova Milk Bar, beating up hobos, and raping innocent women in their own homes. They lie, cheat, and steal to get what they need. And they don't feel badly about it. Unfortunately for Alex, our humble narrator and lover of classical music, he's in for a little change. After being set up by his fed up buds, he is arrested for murder, sentenced to fourteen years, and he's scheming all the while to get out of it. When he hears of an experimental treatment that guarantees to ""cure"" him of his violent tendencies and secure him as a free citizen, he jumps at the chance. However, things do not go exactly as planned.<br/><br/>Malcolm McDowell  who is extremely underrated  provides an extraordinary performance as Alex. He is hilarious, terrifying, and pitiful at the same time. This could not have been an easy character to portray. Alex is a delinquent: a murdering, thieving, violent rapist. However, McDowell's performance makes him extremely likable. In the end, it's so easy to root for Alex. It would have been easy to make the character detestable, but the way in which the film develops and the way he is portrayed, Alex is our hero and friend.<br/><br/>As disturbing as the film is said to be, it is that much more hilarious. I was not expecting to laugh out loud at such things as I found myself laughing at. This is essentially a black comedy more than a drama. A Clockwork Orange makes many points regarding society and government, but it does so in a way that is completely satirical. Most of the laughs come from Alex's narration and the utter ridiculousness of some scenes. In one scene, Alex attacks a woman with what looks like a ceramic penis. There is also a scene in which, while reading the Bible, Alex imagines himself in certain Biblical scenes. This includes the boy being fed grapes by topless girls that he refers to as his ""wife's handmaidens."" There are sex scenes at double speed, rape scenes set to songs such as 'Singin' in the Rain', etc. It is stylishly violent, bitingly satirical, and nothing short of entertaining throughout its entirety.<br/><br/>The film raises many questions regarding the infringement of rights. Is it moral to ""dehumanize"" a person by ridding them of violent tendencies? Is reforming criminals, cleaning up the prisons, and making the streets safer really worth tampering with a person's free choice by forcing them to change themselves and their beliefs? Is this a right that the government has? Is what's ""best for society"" necessarily the best thing for the individual? These are all questions which the audience may draw their own answers. Although no such ""treatment"" exists today, it is easy to see that the film may not be far off from the direction society is moving toward. Alex was a despicable human being, but didn't he have the freedom to be that? However you want to look at it, A Clockwork Orange examines this, implying that free choice is essentially what makes a person who they are.<br/><br/>A Clockwork Orange was released in 1971, over thirty-five years ago. The amazing thing is that it is not, in any way, dated. The film has a timeless feel. It looks good for being as old as it is. It has also stood the test of time, becoming a classic in the eyes of many. This is definitely a rewarding film experience. A Clockwork Orange may be a little rough and some may consider it graphic, but the themes are relevant to every culture in any time. This is a great film that will surely endure for years to come.<br/><br/>10/10"

Now I have come to know this movie as one of the most surreal and masterful films of all time. It has plenty of philosophical content, an intriguing story, a wonderful performance by Malcolm McDowell and a great variety of unforgettable moments created by the images and the music of the film. This is Stanley Kubrick's best film ever, having more human substance to it than 2001: A Space Odyssey and more fun (even if it is dark) than any of his other films (except for Dr. Strangelove). This 70s cult classic has definitely earned its place in film history and will hopefully continue to entertain future audiences."
"funkyfry","10","6","10","8 October 2002"," Exquisite film package with disturbing contents.
","A tyro film for Kubrick and McDowell -- perhaps a career best for both great film artists.  Tale of a dark future where people have largely traded their freedom of thought for security (should hit close to home these days).  Alex is the apotheosis of this:  he is literally turned into a machine through pharmaceutical therapy, forced to ""viddy"" scenes of rape, murder, and fascism to condition him against violence.  He also loses the ability to listen to Beethoven's 9th Symphony, the ""punishment element"" or, the tragic ""weepy part"", depending on your viewpoint.  Kubrick's film is deliberately provocative, forcing us to identify with Alex although it unflinchingly shows his hideous acts and his stupidity.  Marvelous photography, direction, acting.<br/><br/>One thing that strikes me in particular is how well Kubrick and his art men have achieved their goal of making the environments the characters inhabit reveal their emotions or tensions.  Particularly memorable are the wasted theatrical environment that is the stage for the battle with ""Billy Boy"" and his droogs and the cramped, ""futuristic"" apartment Alex shares with his parents.  It's crammed with smiley faced sunflowers and psychedelic wallpaper, every bit the degraded vision of the flower child generation brought with a push into comfortable middle age.  Doctors and clinics are sterilized white, their plastic gloves and needles marking out their own self-conscious state of superiority and objectivity.  And the final section of the film brings Alex through a succession of locations, ending up depositing him back ""Home"" for his suicidal attempted finale.  Place and situation are thus shown to be very important or ""conditioning"" of the individual's actions, for although Alex seems to be a ""hero"" or ""active"" character, he is in fact only clever in that he can master many different situations (the streets, prison, clinics) by adapting himself to his present circumstances and surroundings, whatever they may be.  This places him, in the final situations, as the pawn of situations and people outside his control.<br/><br/>Striking, unforgettable, infinitely rewatchable."

","Alex is one of the worst delinquents you've ever seen, but his treatment is even more deterrent.  The worst punishment by the authorities of a delinquent I could think of was something like solitary confinement or lobotomy.  Until I saw this movie.  Anthony Burgess' ultra-violence (and the old 'in and out') isn't very controversial anymore if you consider the success of Fight Club and many others since Clockwork.  But the message (social problem) is still very important.  It comes in the form of moral terror and science fiction (although you might not even think it's SF after having seen it) but is the best character study I have ever seen.  The question is whose character is studied here: the authorities' or Alex'?<br/><br/>  This is definitely Malcolm McDowell's best achievement by far.  He kind of made this into his own movie.  I don't think I could ever take a look at McDowell again without seeing his incorrigible character from this film. Could anybody?<br/><br/>  I couldn't help but drop my jaw due to astonishment and admiration when I saw this film a few years ago, although I had seen it ten years before and probably never fully comprehended but remembered every detail.  It's so beautiful (neither idyllic nor romantic!) in any way.  It doesn't need gore and blood n' guts to leave a strong taste.  That is the achievement of cinematographer John Alcott (Shining, Barry Lyndon, No way out) and Kubrick's perfection.  Almost everything in this film is unforgettable: the decor of the film, the slang Alex and his collaborators use (without subtitles probably even incomprehensible), the new interpretation of famous music and the outstanding performances of the rest of the cast.<br/><br/>  Kubrick seemed to have touched a wound when he made Burgess' novel into cinema.  While I'm writing this I realise that there is a US mockumentary named Punishment Park (1971!) that has a comparable frightening message. First, Punishment Park is also banned from television (not by it's director but by US government I hear) because of its extremely disturbing imagery. Secondly it is also a denunciation of the punishment of (supposed) delinquents.  Third it is from the same era and in the not so obvious form of SF.  Well, see for yourself if it's comparable, but don't expect the brilliance of Clockwork.<br/><br/>I think I have to conclude that this is one of three best films (2001: A Space Odyssey, Dr. Strangelove) by one of my favorite directors.  This film is one of the reasons cinema is my favorite form of art.<br/><br/>

"jmhaber","10","6","10","16 June 2001"," Satire of Modern Society's Criminal Policy
","I enjoy A Clockwork Orange because it is very well done and the scenes brim with satire.  Having read many reviews, I think people often miss the point of the film's satire, at least my interpretation of it.<br/><br/>The movie is a satire about how the mixture of politics and the ideology of `political correctness' fails to recognize the existence of and to understand the nature of evil and, as a result, fails to deal with it appropriately.  The lesson is that evil exists and it must be dealt with forcefully and effectively.  What is being satirized IS today's society.<br/><br/>The main character is an evil person and the government had the chance to lock him away forever (or to actually reform his psychology), but instead he only received a 14 year sentence.  Then the government believed that evil criminals could be physically conditioned against violence and that the effects would be permanent.  The movie's ending, `I was cured all right', suggests that a person's mindset will eventually triumph over conditioning. The main character got out of jail and he still had an evil mindset.<br/><br/>The end result is that the government invested energy in ineffective treatments (unproductive prison time, brainwashing) that it thought would be effective and ended up releasing a criminal onto the streets for political reasons, just like today's system.  After all, the Clockwork Orange government needed space for political prisoners (today's consensual `criminals'-drug offenders, prostitutes, etc) and had to find a way to release the true criminals.  In fact, the government went so far as to knowingly turn thugs into policemen.  (Is that similar to giving criminals free tuition at colleges while their victims pay for it with tax dollars? This happened in Massachusetts.)  If the movie isn't a satire of our modern system where child molesters are released from `correctional facilities' only to later rape and murder children, what is it?  The politically correct view denies the existence of evil.  It holds that criminals are victims of bad family situations and unfortunate upbringings.  Since criminals cannot help themselves, political correctness holds that we shouldn't punish them too hard but should try to be more understanding and tolerant of them.<br/><br/>The movie is horrifying because that anyone could be so senselessly evil is horrifying.  My reading of the satire's take home message is that society must uncompromisingly protect itself against evil and that reforming criminals requires the prisons to figure out how to convince them to sincerely choose to want to be moral."

","""A Clockwork Orange"" starts at a ""Milk Bar"" where they drink ""Milk Plus."" I don't know what it's in the milk as Alexander DeLarge (Malcolm McDowell) narrates the contents of it and it sounds like he's talking in a different language, but it's intoxicating nevertheless. This is their prep work. Going to the bar sets the mood and the mind. After this, the ""droogs,"" come across an old ""filthy"" man- a homeless man- who's drinking and singing away. Once Alex jams some night stick looking weapon into the hobos stomach, the hobo, goes on to preach about the state of the world and tells the gang to ""do him in"" as he rambles about the violence crisis the world is facing and its ""lawless"" lands. It was terrible acting from the hobo and terrible dialogue, or should I say, terrible preaching. This scene, as ineffective as it may be, sets the tone and basic underlying theme of the rest of the film. The government has lost control. The gang then proceeds to beat the hobo with chains and canes. This is not the end of a night out on the town. The droogs talk their way into a house and the woman opens the door. The gang quickly rushes in and bounds the husband and wife. Alex then rapes the wife as he sings ""Singin in the Rain."" The helpless husband watches in horror. The act is funny in which it's presented in satire form. The singing done by Alex during his rape almost diverts the attention of what's really happening. The goofiness of the gang and the way they talk, walk, and act becomes more funny than horrifying. This satire will muster up some laughs and the acting of Malcolm McDowell is extraordinary, but the direction of Kubrick is heinous. The supporting performances around McDowell are horrid, over the top, and uncontrolled.<br/><br/>The major theme is when the government backs a testing program, which forces its patients to take a shot that gives them a sickening feeling as they watch horrible acts of violence against their will. This gives the patients the feeling of never wanting to resort to violence again. Alex couldn't resist women, which is the reason why he raped them. If he wanted something, it was there for the taking. Alex is tested and the treatment worked!!!! This little twist takes away the freedom to choose- even if you chose to be a rapist.<br/><br/>Once Alex has no free will the plot thickens. It thickens so much Kubrick get's lost in what he wants to say, but he knows one thing: Alex is the only thing that's normal and Alex signifies the criminal world. The criminal world is normal? Lw-abiding citizens are distorted and abnormal? Intereting idea Kubrick. Interesting idea. The testing now forces Alex into becoming a non-offensive person. He can't chose what he wants. When aggravated he can't fight back. ""Violence is a very horrible thing. You're learning that now. Your body is learning it."" <br/><br/>The body learns it, but the mind loses all control. To make matters worse, when he's released for being cured, he becomes homeless and finds his parents have rented out his room to a stranger. Alex is shown no support from his parents. Ah, the life of a released criminal. Society labels poor old Alex improperly even though he's been rehabilitated (You can wipe away the tears. Kubrick would appreciate that). They care more about this new son than Alex. <br/><br/>""A Clockwork Orange"" makes the point that: when criminals are released the world changes so much that society won't allow them to conform, creating no options. Once again, this is the governments problem, you see. Alex becomes homeless and with no place to go, he wanders around. He can't go back to his old lifestyle because, once again, the government takes that right away too. Alex has no place to go because when you've been gone so long society won't allow you to conform, and since the government took his freedom of choice away; he can't make a living for himself the way he once did. Alex runs into familiar faces that now take advantage of him and since he's cured we're supposed to feel sorry for him. The victims now get their revenge. As the scope of the second act and the third act widen, Alex becomes the victim and everyone else he's ever harmed, as well as the government, have taken away his free will. Now all the innocent people are the evil-doers and bad guys that we should hate. Alex fins himself on the opposite end of the spectrum. They're the bad guys now and Alex is the good guy. ""Government is Murderer."" <br/><br/>Once some very bad things happen to Alex it makes news when he's hospitalized. He undergoes some more treatment done by the same government in attempt to hide the public shame of the experiment gone wrong. After more experimenting with Alex' brain, we see a much different Alex than in the previous act. We see the old Alex: Unfiltered and very much the same. In the end there's no great message. There's no solution to the problems presented. It's just a glorifying look at violence and blaming the government for abusing their power and using criminals as animals to test, manipulate, and ruin. In the end, you'll get the feeling that the director wants you to be happy for Alex. Why should you be happy? Because he can now go back to his antics that we seen in the first 30 minutes as he dreams of a rape, and says, ""I've been cured, all right."" Congratulations Alex. You're cured. We're all so happy for you. Now, go out and rape somebody. Make Mr. Kubrick proud."

"gizmomogwai","10","5","8","19 December 2009"," Rated X for excellent
","With A Clockwork Orange (1971), Stanley Kubrick gave us no doubt one of the darkest protagonists of renowned film; this punk teenager Alex engages in acts of brutal violence (""ultra-violence"") and rape. It's repugnant and I didn't have a lot of sympathy for him; he's apparently the worst kind of person, completely uncaring about the feelings of others, with little in his background that seems to push him into this. If anything, he's the one who's pushing. He likes Beethoven, indicating he's relatively smart and should know better. A Clockwork Orange is set in the future (when exactly, I don't know- it may be the present day by now). Is this really where the makers of the show thought we were headed? A place where it's just part of growing up for everyone to be raping women as part of everyday teenage rebellion? That can't be allowed, rape is too harmful a crime to society.<br/><br/>But then the movie shifts to examining what's to be done with criminals like Alex; after the boy is sent to prison for accidentally killing a woman, he's subjected to a new technique intended to make sex and violence physically distressful for him, and he is then released. One can definitely sympathize with the goal to cut down crime, but as it is pointed out in this movie, this doesn't make him good in his soul. And the movie makes an argument that this kind of psychological control is a bad idea. Prison, it seems, is a better though not perfect solution. The movie talks a bit about rehabilitation. Is the film's message that it's futile? That we need criminals and shouldn't change them? I don't think so, I believe in most cases rehabilitation works; but I agree with this movie that that might be better achieved through prison than psychological control and torment. This is the kind of movie that makes you think, that you can have arguments over, and that's what makes it a classic.<br/><br/>I can definitely see why this was rated X- it's fairly extreme in violence and sexuality. Even one of the victims has a room full of erotic art. The language of the movie is also interesting- with new words, you have decode it but it is understandable, reminding me of Shakespeare. All things considered, it's fairly horror show."

Stanley Kubrick is a master at directing, and here is his best film. Malcolm McDowell is excellent as Alex, giving one of my favorite character performances.

Women were shown as being completely powerless against Alex. <br/><br/>Men can watch the rape scenes in A Clockwork Orange with the security of knowing this will never happen to them. To men this is only entertainment. <br/><br/>Only female nudity was exploited in this movie. In the one scene where Alex is naked, his private parts are shielded by a table. <br/><br/>At the end of the movie, it was infuriating to realize that Alex would get away with everything he had done, and continue to torture people in the future. The press caused the public to sympathize with Alex. The old man Alex beat so viciously that he had to use a wheelchair was locked up for political reasons. The press was responsible for unleashing Alex upon society. Personally, the only ending I would have found appropriate would be one in which Alex was executed for his violent crimes."

","I am actually a kubrick fan. I loved the book too. The movie however is terrible. Words cannot begin to express how much I hate this movie. From the terrible zoom lens shots to the shoddy production design and bad photography. The script misses key elements from the book. Characters disappear without a trace and one of the defining scenes where Alex plies some old ladies with alcohol in exchange for an alibi is inexplicably absent from the movie. It is mysoginistic trash. The book describes the sexy costume the girl wears who is to be a temptation to Alex after his conditioning and Kubrick uses the opportunity to show yet another pair of bare breasts. A scene where a young girl has been kidnapped by a gang is replaced with an unnecessary rape scene. Every woman is a victim in this movie. This is definately one for women haters. To be avoided at all cost."

","I tried to watch this a couple of years ago - I couldn't. I just couldn't, because what I saw in the first minutes was too much for me. Now while some say that the violence is so over the top and dated it does nothing anymore to the viewer nowadays, I have to strongly disagree. The interviews on the disc are quite nice and the audio commentary is revealing quite a few things, as is the very in-depth look into Malcolm McDowell (with Q&A and other stuff).<br/><br/>So after 10-15 minutes I had to stop - and everyone kept telling me, that there would be some redemption for all that mayhem. And in a way they were right - though also wrong. Especially considering the real ending to the book. And while I have not yet read that, the extras told me about it. But while you may feel blue about that, the movie could not have ended any other way. And Kubrick again is able to manipulate his audience, making them feel stuff (which incidentally they should not like at all - most of the things they are feeling - and maybe even feel a bit of guilt).<br/><br/>It's also nice to hear, that Kubrick was open to ideas. And that he obviously had a conscience, which is something many thought he had not - especially watching this movie. So there are a few moments that were improvised but there were of course everything staged - and one of the biggest things is the sexual component in the movie - which has a big part combined with all the violence. There is too much sexual objects and hints - one might say it was kind of foreboding ... but then again, it seems to be human nature overall, so he just took something that was there and ran with it.<br/><br/>There's so much to depict here - set design, framing/cinematography, dialog, mood, acting ... you could write about so many things, that all culminate in a great movie - if you can stomach to watch it of course"

","""Oh? And what's so stinking about it?""<br/><br/>Well, according to my fellow reviewers, it glorifies violence (especially towards women,) it's too weird, the language is too hard to understand, it doesn't stick close enough to the book, it's misogynistic, it's too long and boring, the main character is unlikable and it's just stupid!<br/><br/>Is it?<br/><br/>This happens to be my favorite film ever and I have seen a lot of movies. I was twelve when I first watched A Clockwork Orange. I heard it was violent and there were boobs and (being a psychotic, hormonal pre-teen) I instantly wanted to watch it. The film blew my mind!<br/><br/>This film depicts ""graphic horrors"" but are they any worse than the horrors depicted in Schindler's List? Is it ok when a serious film (based on a true story) shows deplorable violence but not when a weird artsy film does it?<br/><br/>Is it really too weird for your taste? It's significantly less weird than Donnie Darko (which many people enjoy.) The language isn't any harder to understand than Shakespeare. As with Shakespeare, you should be able to figure it out in context. If you can't, read a book!<br/><br/>Speaking of the book, the book is centered around (much) younger people and much younger victims. It would be fairly impossible to depict the book in a screen format without somebody going to jail. The only reason people EVER bring up the book is because the ending is different (and they hate that.) Sorry that the book ends on a happier note but not every film needs to have a Hollywood ending. Hopefully you're open minded enough to agree to that statement.<br/><br/>If the film was truly misogynistic, it would depict women in a much more negative sense. Just because the women in the film are naked a lot and bad things happen to them, that doesn't instantly make it misogynistic. If it was actually misogynistic, the women would be depicted as dumb. They're not.<br/><br/>If you can't handle watching a movie for less than two and a half hours, steer clear of Lawrence of Arabia, Gone with the Wind, The Godfather and don't even try to watch the Lord of the Rings trilogy. It's not that long and it's not boring if you actually try to pay attention to it. Sorry it's not Transformers 3.<br/><br/>The main character is meant to be a monster. A lot of characters are. You know, like Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver. If you can't find that Alex's zest for life isn't fun or at least entertaining enough to drive the film then don't bother watching (again) Lawrence of Arabia or (again) The Godfather. The main characters in those films are essentially villains as well. Don't bother with Bonnie and Clyde either.<br/><br/>If you find this movie stupid...I feel sorry for you. This film is actually insanely smart, even to the point where it's a high camp, overly melodramatic (and purposefully so) black comedy (which most people don't seem to understand.) If you find this film stupid, perhaps it is you that is...<br/><br/>So, why is it my favorite film? Imagine my surprise when I watched something that changed my life when all I wanted was blood and nudity. That's how powerful this film is. It took a crazy, weirdo (me) and changed my mindset. I am still a crazy weirdo but I learned to control myself and channel my negative thoughts into positive actions because of this movie.<br/><br/>The plot is basic but becomes complex. A terrible kid named Alex (McDowell) goes out with his friends nightly and strikes terror in people's hearts by committing crimes against society. What happens next will throw you for a loop!<br/><br/>The cinematography is nothing short of masterful. It's the equivalent of watching The Mona Lisa move. The acting is superbly over the top (which is part of the fun.) The message is STRONG and is more ""happy"" than you may initially think. There's a reason an X-Rated film that people hate on and find so controversial was nominated for Oscars and is still on AFI's and IMDB's Top 100 list.<br/><br/>Don't listen to the naysayers! Bring your attention, your open mind and a strong stomach. It's violent, long and weird but it's not much worse than many other films you've no doubt seen. It may just change your life or at the very least, get your Id out!"

","Filmin is the narrator Alex from the beginning to the end. That's why she's seen the audience in the eyes of Alex, who portrays a ruthless, sarcastic, uncommon, offensive, destructive portrait of society's values.<br/><br/>Alex DeLarge, who is an antique hero, and his friends are terrorizing the city with a tendency of violence overflowing with the gang they have established. They include milk and drug mix drinks that make violent tendencies in Korova , aged assailants enter the house of a writer named Alexander and injure him and rape the author's wife. Leadership conflicts, which are increasingly intensifying within the gang, end with Alex's friends falling into a trap and going to jail, and things develop.<br/><br/>Aside from the violence in prison, Alex behaves obediently, takes care of religion and acquires the priestess sympatia in prison (but identifies himself with the Roman soldiers who tortured him, not Jesus, while reading the Bible).<br/><br/>Alex is chosen as a guinea pig for the ""Criminals, Reconciliation and Recruiting"" program, which the political party at the head of the country uses to win elections. Alex will be released if the program is successful. The minister gives him political advantage by using Alex to show how he cleans the streets from the blame.
Throughout the program, Alex hands out war and Nazi genocide images in the form of hands, with arms tied, arms wide open, accompanied by Beethoven's 9th symphony. That Beethoven is a unique asset that reflects the only beautiful thing in Alex, that he respects and values. As a matter of fact, Alex's Beethoven busts and drawings in the prison room used Beethoven's music during the Ludovico session, which the minister had not missed. At the end of all this, Alex can not think of applying violence and sexuality. Alex's acts of violence are tried to be prevented by ludovico, a violent action. Alex is released when the program is successful.
When Alex returns home, he sees his family rent a room. His family did not want him, he stayed on the street. The drunk beggar, who had previously been beaten with his gang friends, lynched himself to other beggars and lynched himself. The cops who came to Alex's call for help are his gang friends. Alex is also beating them because their friends are producing violence as police this time. Alex, who managed to get rid of his friends, continues his misfortunes and finds himself at the writer's house he raped his wife. The writer, who does not recognize Alex at first, welcomes him well. But then the writer, who understands who Alex is, takes his wife's revenge by listening to Beethoven, who is conditioned to react to Alex. Alex, who can not tolerate the pain he suffocates, throws himself out of the window and commits suicide.At this point, we need a psychoanalytic termination to better analyze Alex and the society he lives in. The concept that can be brought against crime and punishment in psychoanalysis is ressentiment. Here, in order for ressentiment to be able to be found, a situation of impotence must occur as Alex has experienced. Alex, a man who does not obey / submissive to a repressive social control, resorting to destruction in the name of self-emancipation. So the problem of being present at the root of Alex's violence lies. In such an environment in which the modern state is at a loss to humans, perceiving Alex's acts of violence as an entertainment and pleasure element will be a flawed and incomplete point of view. Even talking in the Russian language of Nadsat, the produce of Alex and his gang friends, is an expression of anti-order tendencies of the efforts to escape from the present.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In modern societies, control of vengeance and revenge is possible through punishment. It is worth noting here that state violence is legitimate. In modern states, the use of force has been left out of personality, leaving the state alone. Thus, it is possible to say that power uses it to preserve its continuity, its already existing destructiveness.
State power implements ideal illusion of society through mechanisms such as uniform citizenship. Controls the movement of people by their minds and dominates their lives and asserts those who are contrary to their ideology, the different, or in other words the other, in the direction of their own aims and desires. As a matter of fact, in the film, the system takes the right to choose Alex and transforms it into a machine. Alex's violence has been rehabilitated and eventually Alex has been obliged to comply with the behavior of the community. The torture of Alex tame it, but it is not better or more moral.<br/><br/>The concept of violence / violence in the film is also ironic and it is almost possible to see it on the whole of film. This is particularly evident in the scene where writer Alexander initially falls into culpability in his second encounters with caretaker Alex.The concept of violence / violence in the film is also ironic and it is almost possible to see it on the whole of film. This is particularly evident in the scene where writer Alexander initially falls into culpability in his second encounters with caretaker Alex.<br/><br/>On the other hand, it is chaotic, the symbols of destruction and the strengthening of the violent bond of the state, when the four inhabitants (Alex and the gang) we are constantly facing throughout the film are sent. Four aggressive and victim motifs, first of all, comes on the stage when Alex and his gang friends are attacking an old beggar. Alex is a victim after four policemen have been beaten in jail. And finally, after leaving prison, the writer's house, the writer, and four people next to him have poured Alex's food, and Alex is still a victim.n connection with the violence, Nazilere is often sent in the film. At the beginning of the film, Alex and the joke are on the stage where they are beaten by other gang members, and the other gang members have Nazi uniforms on them. During the Ludovico treatment, Alex is shown with images of the Nazis. Finally, the uniform and physical image of the prison manager brings Hitler to mind. As is well known, the Nazis have imposed their close tarihe stamps as the most obvious example of the state violence mechanism. It is possible to explain the place of sending the Nazi in the film in this way.<br/><br/>At the end of the film, Alex, who is seen in the hospital bed, negotiates with the minister who comes to him. He committed suicide to die, but reborn. This second Alex is different from Alex we know; Alex is now like a minister, a hypocrite. It has become a socialized and orderly puppet. The government, which initially gave Alex a political advantage by reason of purifying the society from criminals, finally uses Alex to smother the streets again. It depends on the fact that the system can survive; violence and crime must not be completely destroyed and control must be in the hands of the system. Otherwise, society will direct this violence to the system itself.<br/><br/>As a result, A Clockwork Orange discusses the master-slave dialectic in the context of the mutual processing of crime and punishment in the modern society, and the extent to which the authoritarian punishment method of imposing Alex in the name of ameliorating Alex frees him (!) And whether the freedom of the individual is possible by enslavement of other members of society."

","A Clockwork Orange is a disturbing but yet a very beautiful masterpiece of film-making, directed by Stanley Kubrick in 1971, when Britain experienced a heavy wave of violence and brutality. It creates the ultimate study of manipulation of mind, which tries to eliminate the deviance, according to the standards of appropriate behavior. The movie starts from the picture of bloody red screen, which illustrates the spirit of that time, when the world was undergone by severe youth riots, Red brigades, who kidnapped famous political leaders, different sabotages and robberies, followed by American war in Vietnam. Besides real life, violence started to be represented in cinematography. Movies used to imply that if violence is the one solution of critical situation, thus, it has to be justified. They used to convince people that brutality is something that people are protected from. A Clockwork Orange, in contrast, proves that everything that occurs around is a result of mutual common action. The movie provides a speculation on the essence of human aggression, freedom of will and adequacy of the punishment. <br/><br/>The happening takes place in a near-futuristic London society. ""Our humble narrator"", Alex DeLarge seems to be an attractive guy who lives a peaceful life. He shares his room with a snake, is fond of art and listens to Ludvig Van Beethoven all day long. However, in a nighttime, our young protagonist becomes a leader of the sadistic gang of ""droogs"" who regularly commits the acts of ""ultra-violence"", followed by brutal sexual rapes and severe robberies. The band enjoys breaking into strangers' houses and scoffing over their victims. The droogs have no regards or compassion for their victims because all the crimes they practice, strike their collective fantasies. Moreover, they intensify their pleasures by classical pieces of arts, which inspire and encourage them to commit much more terrible crimes. However, according to the accepted belief, the evil has to be punished. All to the luck, he is convicted of murder and rape and is arrested for 15 years. After two years of imprisonment, he decides to take part in a new rehabilitation therapy developed by the government, which is targeted on criminals to cure them from violence. Alex starts to be injected by a newly developed drug that with connection of pictures or movies with violence causes a feeling of fear, disgust and aversion. The government thought it could ""fix"" his deviance. <br/><br/>According to Stanley Kubrick's intentions, the audience has to hate Alex and to be afraid of him: he represents not only the social vices, such as crime, brutality or cynicism, but also all the darkest traits of human social minds. But in fact, the feeling of compassion arises when Alex becomes mechanical on the inside. A Clockwork Orange is a movie about human instincts, about the personal choice between the good and the evil. This is under our personal decision to define what is morally good and what is not. However, there are norms within the society, and the government, the main protector and claimer for mutual security stands for regulation of the immoral behavior of certain individuals who go beyond the standards of appropriate behavior. The slogan of the movie claims that ""violence causes violence"" and the main evil here is the government itself, which manipulates people for the pure political needs, abusing their personal, social and civil liberties. Alex became a brainwashed; now he is able to choose only good. Through the therapy, the government wanted to create an ideal individual, who has no implications on evil and violence. But was Alex really cured? Cured from what? It is very difficult to say. Cured from striving to commit a sin or from the disgust to these sins itself? Nevertheless, the question is: ""Can government demand from its citizens not to commit the actions which the government itself operates with?"" Thus, an overall idea of this film is an illustration of the reality: despite the fact that violence is against the norm, it exists and can never be eliminated."

They lie, steal, cheat and terrorize ordinary folk for self pride, joy and ultimately, self destruction. As Alex's over the top, dictating and bullying ways cause a tense battle for respect and appreciation amongst his followers, they finally wage war and realise the only way for free will is to teach their master a lesson of his own. As Alex is fooled and dishonoured in a planned act of vengeance by his gang and imprisoned for murder, he finds himself in the helpless vice of a radical new technique designed to rehabilitate and reform even the most menacing of criminals. But as Alex is released into the uninvited arms of the very society he once terrified, he begins to learn that he isn't as welcome as he first thought. Written by Anthony Burgees in 1962, A Clockwork Orange is recognised as one of the first films to prove that cinema could be an exciting and profound art form. It was after all, shot at the beginning of movie makings greatest eras, the ground-breaking 1970's. Stanley Kubrick has succeeded in delivering a masterpiece of risqué and energetic storytelling, as we witness movie making at its absolute peak of creativity and imaginative brilliance."
"avik-basu1889","10","3","4","29 June 2017"," Kubrick lays down the morality trap !!!
","'A Clockwork Orange' is violent, it's brutal, but what it's not is a film that glorifies its violence as many critics and audiences believe it does. Every scene of violence, however ugly it may be, serves a purpose thematically. The violence is often accompanied by playful classical/modern music. I think the music and playful tone of the scenes directly express the allure that violence holds in the minds of youngsters like Alex. An important aspect to be noted in the violent scenes is the lack of blood or the lack of shots showing the after-effects of violence. It's just unreasonable violence. But the lack of logic behind the committing of these violent acts and the playful tone of the scenes will make the viewer question why violence is so alluring to Alex and his 'droogs'. Why does he get stimulated by the prospect of harming others? Is Alex a bad seed, is he naturally 'evil'? Now although this question is not directly answered, there are hints and imagery littered throughout the film that suggest otherwise. In the movie, Kubrick depicts a society around Alex that cannot completely wash its hands off the crimes of Alex and claim absolution from the guilt of giving rise to boys like him. Kubrick implicitly hints towards the existence of elements like parental neglect and abuse, the insidious hypocrisy of authority figures like Mr.Deltoid, governmental impotence in dealing with and thereby curbing vandalism and criminal activity, systemic fascism and an overall societal apathy leading to perennial decadence. These elements underline the notion that Alex in spite of his demonic actions and tendencies might not be naturally evil and he might not be the sole person to blame. Alex is a product of the society that he lives in and of course a product of the government that 'protects' him.<br/><br/>On one hand, Kubrick opens up the discussion in the social context, but at the same time, he manages to convincingly condense the discussion to a personal level too. This is because the questions of morality that this film asks will be viewed and remarked upon differently by every viewer based on their own sensibilities. After Alex undergoes the Ludovico Technique and gets completely stripped of his right to choose, everything that comes up in the film subsequently involves Kubrick making the audience ask themselves the tough central question: Should I feel sorry for Alex? This is the sequence where the extensively wild nature of Alex's 'ultra- violence' in the first half of the film achieves further relevance and purpose. Had Kubrick not had the proverbial 'balls' to show Alex at his worst in his violent days in the most visceral manner possible, the viewer's dilemma while seeing Alex suffer after undergoing the experiment, would've somewhat lost its potency. It is interesting to note that there is a reference made in the film about the distinctions between the Old Testament and the New Testament of the Bible. I think this is pertinent, because anyone who sides with the Old Testament's 'eye for an eye' attitude towards wrong-doers will retain their contempt towards Alex even during his moments of extreme suffering and will not sympathise with him. They will support the experiment due to the result offered by it which is the eradication of the criminal instinct, even if it means making Alex undergo inhuman treatment. But anyone who sides with the New Testament's far more liberal attitude towards wrong-doers, will sympathise with Alex and protest against the government's totalitarian decision to strip him of his humanity instead of giving him the time to redeem himself on his own. Opting in favour of the experiment means the dehumanisation of criminals who after all are still human beings. While being patient and allowing the criminal in prison to correct himself from within and then allowing him to go out into the world again, involves risking the prospect of releasing potential ticking bombs into the world who can easily revert back to their darker selves. Kubrick severely tests each and every viewer's dedication and conviction to their beliefs, no matter which side of the divide the viewer falls on with regards to the questions of morality. I appreciate the fact that unlike the original novel, Kubrick leaves the question answered without allowing Alex any sort of redemption in the end and thereby not allowing the viewer any reprieve either. He presents the problem, but doesn't present a solution to the problem because a universal, all encompassing solution to such a complex issue might not be so easily available in the first place. The relevance of the issue of capital punishment in our current times proves how even today, these issues remain unresolved. The more overarching social problems explored in the film are easier to locate and take care of, compared to the central issue of morality and the inherent subjectivity involved.<br/><br/>'A Clockwork Orange' has the distinctive Kubrickian austerity to it. The camera placements, the intricate detailing of the sets to juxtapose futuristic advancements with dystopian decadence, the symmetrical visual compositions, the extensive use of wide angle lens, the extreme idiosyncrasies of the characters, the darkly comic tone,etc. everything screams out the name Kubrick. Now, let's talk about Malcolm McDowell. This is one of the most uninhibited portrayals of a despicable character in film history. He prances around like a peacock owning every minute. There is an intensity to him that complements Kubrick's style perfectly. McDowell's version of the 'Kubrick stare' which the film starts off with might be my favourite and the most iconic of them all. Wendy Carlos' score for the film is dark, hypnotic and again works brilliantly with Kubrick's visual style. Kubrick himself was a master when it comes to using music to underline mood and tone. Just like 2001, he makes optimum use of classical music and the music is in itself a character in the film.<br/><br/>This is one of the easiest recommendations that I can ever make."
"TheAlbyMetevier","10","3","4","22 June 2017"," Awesome Movie
","A pure classic movie. A psychological Thriller. One of the best of all time. Is a comedy and a horror all in one. You can't beat this movie. A oldie but with watching. You will love this movie. Makes you wonder why can't Hollywood make more movies like this. Made in1971 but is way before its time.<br/><br/>My favorite movie 11 June 2001 | by Ayatollah (Florida) – See all my reviews Without a doubt, my absolute favorite film of all time. I first saw this movie three years ago and I have been in love with it (and Stanley Kubrick) ever since. I never get tired of seeing this movie. Why it remains so under-appreciated (at least by ""casual"" movie viewers) is beyond me. Everything is great; acting, direction, cinematography, the sets, everything. <br/><br/>Something that I don't think anyone else commented on was the Russian motif. The names of the droogs (Alexander, George, Peter, and Dim...short for Dimitri) are decidedly Russian. The singer referenced in the record store, Johnny Zhivago, has obvious Russian overtones. The statement made by the Minister of the Interior about the ""peace-loving citizens"" is a direct reference to the name that Soviet government representatives applied to their people when talking about the Cold War. Red seems to stand out from other colors. And, of course, who could forget Nadsat, the Russian slang language? I wonder what Burgess and Kubrick were trying to suggest about the future of Ingsoc (those familiar with ""1984"" will understand."
"sdplissken-1","10","3","4","11 May 2017"," A Clockwork Orange wouldn't be the same without Malcolm McDowell!
","To say this movie is strange is an understatement. The level of violence committed makes one think about the world around them, wondering if we can truly forgive such horrible acts.<br/><br/>With that said, Malcolm McDowell provides a performance that launched an iconic, legendary career most actors would kill for. As Alex, the film gives you a first person perspective, with Malcolm McDowell, as Alex, providing narration during the film, seeming to give you an inside look into his mind as the events unfold on film.<br/><br/>This is a movie that should be on EVERYBODY'S required viewing list. It's one I highly recommend."
"TheBlueHairedLawyer","10","3","4","14 February 2017"," Excellent but probably not the right story for everyone
","Undoubtedly the violence, rape and abuse featured in this film will offend or disturb some people. Of course Alex's commentary in the language of ""Nadsat"" will confuse some people, too. This is definitely not a film for everyone, but there are a lot of misconceptions around it that often turn people off of watching A Clockwork Orange before actually giving it a chance.<br/><br/>First and foremost, people avoid this film because of the graphic and violent content. Don't be fooled though, the constant sex and violence is not there for sadistic cruelty, there's a lot more to it than that. Yeah yeah, I'm sure there are a few edgy teen sickos who get off on this film, but to really understand the point of all the violence in the story, you have to really pay attention. Alex, the main character of the story, doesn't even view his cruel actions as ""violent"" or ""abusive"". He sees it as all in good fun. In truth, he's a momma's boy living in his parents' house who has an affinity for classical music and art. This is the side of him that nobody sees, because all too often he is judged by the sadistic nature of his actions. When an experimental treatment is performed on Alex, he is no longer violent, but he's stripped of enjoyment and personality. When he is released from prison, he is attacked, kicked out of his home, beaten-up and belittled. So, was Alex really a psychopathic sadist, or was his behavior just a response to an equally cruel dystopian society? Different viewers will interpret this masterpiece of a film in different ways, and that's part of what makes it so special.<br/><br/>Also, a lot of people don't watch A Clockwork Orange because they see it as a ""hipster"" film or an art film. Although very artistic in nature with its vivid colors, pop-out imagery and its impressive soundtrack, A Clockwork Orange is not all that alternative. It's a story that anybody can enjoy regardless of your interests, and it's a timeless story as well despite being produced in the 1970's. Besides, even if this film really was considered alternative, that's no reason to hate it. It has excellent acting, the director put evident talent into it and the characters become almost real.<br/><br/>Perhaps A Clockwork Orange is a little overrated for what it is, but love it or hate it, it's certainly a classic in every sense of the word, and watching it even just once will have you contemplating the world you live in and the people around you."
"talisencrw","10","3","4","16 April 2016"," A cinematic pleasure for any cinephile to experience!
","As time goes by, I'll always appreciate my Grade 10 English class (1984-85), taught by Mr. Terry. Looking back, it's probably the year that I was introduced to the most great literary works of all my life (especially 'Anthem' by Ayn Rand and 'Nausea' by Jean-Paul Sartre). Included that year in the course's curriculum was Anthony Burgess' dystopian masterwork, 'A Clockwork Orange' (as well as George Orwell's 'Animal Farm'--like Frank Sinatra would have said, 'It was a very good year'). I was mesmerized with it from the instant I noticed the unique approach to language, the 'ultraviolence' and of course, the eternal question of free will, its relationship to good-and-evil, and the can of worms of the myriad of ethical dilemmas that comes to the fore of individual freedom and rights versus that of society at large. The genius of Burgess was being able to put so well and forcibly, yet in such an entertaining way, so many issues that, had most anyone else set forth on the endeavor, would have come up with the type of off-putting, heavy-handed sermon that would never have reached such a literary pinnacle, and been required reading even now, generations later. It hasn't aged or dated a day.<br/><br/>Most cinematic observers felt the book unfilmable. Director Kubrick's adaptations work so well, particularly this, '2001: A Space Odyssey' and 'The Shining' (even though Stephen King would fervently disagree about the latter) because he, as he did with 'Dr. Strangelove', can so easily both find unforgettable visual metaphors for his ideas and so handily combine humour (an under-recognized trait of his, much more readily associated with say, Sir Alfred Hitchcock) with these heavy and daunting philosophical and intellectual volleys. In the wrong hands (particularly a Stanley Kramer, or his ilk), this could have failed miserably, like typical cinematic treatments of Ayn Rand novels. But this worked triumphantly, and heartily exemplifies one of the greatest directors ever at the apex of his craftsmanship. No self-respecting cinephile can avoid this movie, and I heartily recommend you to read the novel as well, though Kubrick nails it so effectively, reading the novel isn't necessary in the slightest for the film to be enjoyed.<br/><br/>One of the many 'gamechanger' films of Kubrick's storied and remarkable career."
"grantss","10","3","4","11 March 2016"," Kubrick's brilliant, darkly-funny, subversive masterpiece
","Kubrick's brilliant, darkly-funny, subversive masterpiece.<br/><br/>Set in the UK in the then-present-time but with some futuristic elements to it, a young man, Alex (played by Malcolm McDowell), is the Beethoven-loving leader of a gang of hedonistic, immoral thugs. They beat up people for fun, fight with other gangs, sexually assault women, break into houses and generally terrorise average citizens without any feeling. Then one day, Alex kills one of their victims and is immediately caught by the Police. He is sent to prison for 14 years. In prison he learns of a Pavlov-like experiment to rehabilitate and reprogram incarcerated criminals... <br/><br/>Searingly brilliant. Master director Stanley Kubrick pulls out all the stops in adapting Anthony Burgess' weird, fantastical, thought- provoking and dark novel to the silver screen. While the subject matter is dark, the approach is quite light and funny, resulting in a morbidly humorous movie. Quite Pythonesque at times in its inanity and dark humour.<br/><br/>Not just comedic, there is drama aplenty and many themes at play. There's a wonderfully subversive element to the movie - the government is shown to be a bunch of incompetent nanny-state morons (though we already knew that...), authority figures in general are shown to be out of touch with reality and, on a minor note, we see who tend to become policemen... There's also a theme of free-will vs conditioned response.<br/><br/>Or you could just view it purely as entertainment and enjoy it anyway. It works on many different levels.<br/><br/>An excellent score contributes to the feel of the movie - Kubrick uses it well to set the mood for the scenes. It contributes particularly well to making dark moments much lighter.<br/><br/>There's also the attention to detail we expect from Kubrick, complete with an Easter Egg or two. Spot the 2001: A Space Odyssey soundtrack in the record shop scene...<br/><br/>Excellent performance by Malcolm McDowell in the lead role. He captures the tone of the movie perfectly. Good supporting cast too.<br/><br/>One of the greatest movies ever made."

This masterpiece is far more complex than a simple romp through a world of youthful violence.

"axsmashcrushallthree","10","3","4","23 June 2006"," Rings true to the very core
","This controversial film is been called out for a variety of reasons here and elsewhere. Its vision has been questioned, its adherence to Burgess' source material has been ridiculed, and its sex/violence has been called gratuitous, among many other things. One reviewer here states that ""art is the antithesis of violence"".<br/><br/>I couldn't disagree more. To me, art is the expression of inner truth. Inner truth is singular to the individual, yet universal to a world that discards its own pretensions and value judgments in a sincere attempt to cathect. In general, the presentation of such art in our world is shaded, subtly and otherwise, by the artist's sense of gain/loss and right/wrong that is dictated by the outer world's expectations.<br/><br/>In Stanley Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange"", there is no such shading - Alex's world is strikingly white-hot in its brilliance and in its pin-spot focus. This film presents its world simply as it is, as well as the characters who inhabit it. Episodes of sex, violence, tenderness, delusion, and manipulation are shown as clear-as-light, deep-focus images of the continuous whole. There is nothing false here - nothing. And accordingly, the impact of the film rips to the core of the viewer's own sense of inner truth.<br/><br/>To quote the shopworn phrase, they don't make movies like this any more, and even for its time, this film stands out as a staggering accomplishment.<br/><br/>Let it take you."
"royale_w_cheez44","10","3","4","4 April 2006"," A Brilliant, Startling, and Unforgettable Film
","I became an instant Kubrick fan once I saw 2001, and I became even more hooked when i saw Dr. Strangelove. A Clockwork Orange solidified my belief that Kubrick is bar none the greatest director ever. This truly unique sci-fi film remains the most disturbing movie I have seen, and it's 35 years old.<br/><br/>The fact that this film lost Best Picture to The French Connection puzzles me and yet, at the same time, doesn't surprise me. The Academy could never reward such a daring film as this, especially a science fiction film. 35 years later, this movie would still warrant a hard R rating, if not a near NC-17. The way that Kubrick puts the violence in the film like it's no big deal is really scary and disturbing, which makes the movie marvelous.<br/><br/>The cinematography and editing of this picture are truly mind-blowing. From the opening image of the anti-hero, Alex, staring down the camera, to the eerie ending shot, you cannot keep your eyes off of the screen. The way the film was shot remains cutting edge to this day, and you'd be amazed at how long the takes are and how mind-blowing the cinematography is. And one could never forget the sex scene, basically a motion blur, to the William Tell Overture. The use of slow-motion was also used perfectly, a breath of fresh air in a time where it is used sloppily and for no reason.<br/><br/>The direction is like none other. The rape scenes are unflinchingly done, and the sporadic and flashy style (rendered cliché by films such as Saw) makes for some of the triipiest scenes on film. Kubrick did wonders with the camera and made for an insane trip, with a startling message of violence in our youth and the effects of a government experiment. One must watch this movie more than once to truly appreciate it.<br/><br/>What really, really makes the film so incredible is Malcolm McDowell. His portrayal of Alex, a young delinquent who entertains himself with violence and rape, is truly one of the greatest performances on film. His nasty sneer and devilish performance is flawless. You can see the way he holds back a grin when he says he's going into jail for murder, and during the treatment scenes, his delight turning to utter shock is unforgettably real. He makes the film what it is: a classic.<br/><br/>As much as I have gushed about the movie, it is definitely not for the faint of heart. The rape scenes get very out of control, and the subject matter is incredibly disturbing. However, if you keep an open mind and aren't a stupid teenager who will watch it for some T & A, you'll realize how amazing of a film this is, and how well it holds up after three and a half decades."

Forget this film in a hurry you will not. >From the perplexing opening scenes to the time the credits role the film grabs you by the ears (and eyes!) and doesn't let go.<br/><br/>ACO is surely Kubricks defining masterpiece. The Background score is incredible (Beethoven anyone?), Malcolm McDowell is unbelievable and given his performance you can see why Kubrick said he wouldn't go ahead with the film if he couldn't get his signature.

","I'm still very young in my film career, but as far as it stands now, A Clockwork Orange is the best example to me of what a live action film can accomplish.  It sets standards that haven't been touched ever since.  The film establishes a rhythmic style carried through the whole film.  The director is as the top of his form, Stanley Kubrick, the only live action director I call a genius anymore.  In wake of most people not understanding the complexity of its art, I'm still after over a dozen viewings in awe of his achievement (and Burgesse's...I'm a huge fan of the novel as well.)  We have entertainment, beauty, direction, music, choreography, acting, writing , ideas, and all together art working in unison throughout this incredibly fast paced two hour movie.  I lost faith in Hollywood for the most part. There is a very small margin of art being produced (or having been produced for that matter) but A Clockwork Orange (and the philosophical-poetic virtuoso 2001) reaffirms that watching the movies is worth sifting through all this popcorn trash and finding life affirming beauty and art.  Let us rejoice in the glory that is A Clockwork Orange bellowing in the face of all that is tyrannical, commercial, exploitative, dumb, pretentious, meaningless waste.  Amen, good night."
"renelsonantonius","10","3","4","17 April 2002"," Meet one of the most deviant characters in cinema history
","I read somewhere that the late Stanley Kubrick was reputed to be against conventional and repressive forms of establishment.If that was so, then I believe that he potently expressed it in ""A Clockwork Orange.""<br/><br/>      Based on Anthony Burgess' 1962 novel, the film introduces us to one of the most violent, amoral and deviant characters in cinema history---Alexander (but of all the film characters, protagonists and antagonists alike, whom I've encountered so far, he's the only one who has registered so strongly in my mind;and Malcolm McDowell's realistic and complex portrayal has greatly helped in making that happen).<br/><br/>      I can't forget the opening shot where, while we begin to hear his introductory voice-over narration, we see Alex, together with his fellow ""droogies,"" sitting idly on the floor and staring sharply at us, as the camera slowly pulls back and then we notice marble (or is it wax?) figures in strangely provocative poses.It serves both as an invitation and a warning:we're invited to take a peek into a ""new friend's"" visionary milieu, but then be prepared for the consequences.<br/><br/>      At first, one can't help but be disgusted at the atrocities---devilish and whimsical at best---that Alex and his gang have committed (they maul an old and sick beggar, involve themselves in a violent gang fight, barge into a quiet household, tie up the couple, torture the man and rape the woman).Alex even disdains his family and entices women (total strangers to him) into sex as if he were asking them for a dance in a party (and this might be so, if one is to have his own ""reading"" of the outrageous scene where Alex does sex with two pretty ladies in fast motion and to the tune of Rossini's ""Overture to Wilhelm Tell"").Such kind of ""rebellious"" attitude of Alex may strike one as being done out of youthful capriciousness---at best, a mere show just to satisfy some self-serving ends;nowhere is to be found any justifiable or rational basis at all.<br/><br/>      But not until the film reaches its critical point where Alex murders (with the use of a ""phallic"" furniture) a woman (who's fascinated with cats) when the latter aggressively refuses his advances does one start to rethink his/her thoughts.You have to see for yourself how Kubrick manipulates the narrative from this point on for the viewers to have a ""change of attitude"" toward Alex.<br/><br/>      After that, one can already make sense of Alex' ""rebellious"" attitude, for the conflict has become clear:it's Alex vs. all the conventional and (as it turns out) dubious forms of establishment---family, government, mass media, education and state.They have laid down the standards on how one must think, feel and act within a given system, but once it is achieved, they are at a loss as to what to make of the individual---to have a firm grip on him or to leave him out in the open---leading them in the end to play the game according to the rules set by the individual himself.<br/><br/>      And in Alex' case, as the state's program of reforming criminals and producing pliant citizens will be put to shame because of the former's failed suicide, the people concerned are now willing to fall on their knees before Alex---let Alex be what he is.""Now, I was finally cured"" has become a classic line."

This film is so well done, you don't even realize what you have felt until it is over.  Brilliantly, Kubrick pulls you right through this movie, controlling your emotions with the onscreen action. Example, at the begining of the film, you witness the horrific acts of violence and rape, so when he is caught, you don't fell bad for him whatsoever.  Through prison and treatment he is ""cured"", and in the demonstration he is beaten to show he will not fight back.  When he is released, he is disowned by his parents, insulted by the guy who lives in his room, beaten by homeless guys, and nearly drowned by his former droggies.  At that point in the movie, I said to myself ""he doesn't deserve this, he did his time, he can't even defend himself"", it was at that point that I realized how talented Kubrick really was.

I feel that the film lacks coherence, and I had a difficult time actually being interested throughout the film. I am not entirely sure what Kubrick was trying to achieve here, but in my personal opinion, I think this film was over-rated. I think the reason why it is so popular is that it questions life, and it focuses on taboo topics.

","In England Alex and his droogs are just one of many small gangs of youths who live for thrills experienced through ultra-violence and forced in and out with girls.  Internal conflict with his droogs sees Alex abandoned at a crime scene where he is arrested.  Faced with 14 years in jail Alex tries to get involved in a new Government led initiative to rehabilitate criminals.<br/><br/>I imagine I'm in the same boat as many users here.  I first saw Clockwork Orange many years ago on a pirate copy where the words `sound quality' and `visual sharpness' didn't play any part.  It wasn't till recently that I was able to watch it on a screen without squinting, when Kubrick's ban was lifted in the UK.  At this point I waited several years till it came to TV before revisiting it  I wanted to watch it away from media hype and make my own mind up.<br/><br/>What I found was a film that was taking it's points from the debate that was going on at the time over treatment of criminals.  The plot is worthy and does set up a situation that becomes more relevant every year in the UK  that of violent disaffected youth.  However Kubrick doesn't look at the wider impact of society on Alex, he only looks at Alex and how he is treated now by society.  His life consists of sex and violence  all for thrills, a picture that is all too realistic.  However only in the second half does Kubrick make some strong points about the nature of people and how society can be as cruel as individuals.<br/><br/>Most of the film is a sort of arty porn type of film.  That's not to criticise it for this, but it does feel like Kubrick is concentrating more on style rather than content.  Visually the film works well, even if some of the scenes of sexual violence I felt were more than they needed to be and it felt like it was revelling in the very things it was criticising.  However at it's heart the story is a good idea and it is told in a weird way that holds the attention.<br/><br/>Alex's weird childlike use of made up words make it feel like he really is a teenager trying to create a world different from his parents and plenty of the images show the reality of his world.  McDowell delivers another great performance and effortlessly carries the film.  However his constant swagger could be criticised for being too much, but at the key moments of weakness he brings out Alex's fear well.  The rest of the support cast give good Orwellian authority figures or vengeful victims well.<br/><br/>Overall this film is worth watching once simply because of the hype.  Now that it's no longer banned it will lose much of the credit it gave you when you could tell people that you'd seen it (now every school kid can rent it on video!) and may lose some critical support as a result.  McDowell is great but Kubrick works harder on his style than making clear, strong points through narrative."

Some find the graphic rape scenes and dialogue revolting but its a masterpiece of violence, music and acting. 10 out of 10 is fully earned and should be within the top 10 i feel, because masterpieces don't come along every day, all though it may not be as good as the book to some, it's still a great movie to all."

","This is a great example of how time can create a mass consensus.We don't watch films like The Godfather,Citizen Kane,or Schindlers List and decide for ourselves what we think of them.Its just predetermined that these films are classics and above the normal critical process.<br/><br/>A Clockwork Orange is the case in front of us here.First there is the bravura technical skill of the film.Lets talk about it.Kubrick is in complete command here.Every extended tracking shot,every perfectly composed frame,every close up,every piece of music in a scene is exactly as the director intended it to be.Few filmmakers ever could create as singular a vision as Stanley Kubrick does in almost every film he made.<br/><br/>The problem here is the unwillingness of Kubrick to allow the audience to think for itself or come to a conclusion about anything in the film without shouting it from the rooftop,and shoving our face in it,again,and again and again.Yes,the film is brutal satire.We aren't meant to sympathize with Alex.We aren't meant to sympathize with anyone in the film.And this is hammered home to us continually,with extreme closeups of bulging eyes and faces shaking as if from palsy.We cant let the audience figure out for themselves what the tone and point of view of a scene is.We must let them know beyond the shadow of a doubt.A perfect example of this is when Alex is carried into the house of the man he had brutalized years before,whose wife he had raped while singing ""Singing In The Rain"".The man doesn't make the connection about who he is,until Alex is taking a bath,and starts singing the song again.Five seconds of this,and a quick reaction shot of the victim would have told you all you needed to know.But no,the song goes on for at least two minutes,and the man starts getting the bulging eyes and uncontrollable shaking.This whole thing extends to the next scene where the man is watching Alex eat.And it goes on forever,with no new information being given to us.<br/><br/>As I stated at the beginning,this film is the recipient of reflexive acknowledged classic status.I think that if we look at this film with objective eyes almost 40 years later,we see a film of great technical skill,with major narrative flaws.Kubrick showed us in film after film how misanthropic he was.This movie is the perfect example of this."
"barnabyrudge","10","4","6","1 June 2007"," Fierce, disturbing, thought-provoking satire.
","Stanley Kubrick takes an allegedly unfilmable novel by Anthony Burgess and transforms it into one of the great masterpieces of cinema. What, exactly, is A Clockwork Orange? A sci-fi social study? A fiercely thought-provoking and disturbing black comedy? A prescient warning of where society is headed? A criticism of how the law deals with crime and criminals? The list could go on and on, for the film could indeed be described as many things. But whichever way one chooses to approach the film, one thing is certain: it is without doubt one of the most uncompromisingly challenging examinations of the many faces of violence ever made. Where lies the attraction of violence, what are the consequences of violence, is there a solution to violence? It would be easy to expect a glib and sentimental answer to such questions, perhaps some comfortable conclusion that even the most evil of individuals is good at heart. But A Clockwork Orange avoids sentimentality and glibness and comfortable conclusions. This is a chilling film which points out that a solution to one evil is very often the evolution of another.<br/><br/>In a dystopian society of the very near future, youths calling themselves Droogs gets their kicks out of sadistic crime. One gang led by the clever but thoroughly nasty Alex (Malcolm McDowell) entertain themselves by assaulting an old tramp, breaking into a home and beating the man of the house before raping his wife, and driving like hooligans around country lanes, forcing other drivers off the road. One evening Alex forces his way into the house of a single woman and attacks her with a gigantic phallic ornament, eventually killing her by smashing the pot penis over her head. But Alex is actually captured for this particular offence and sentenced to 14 years in a rehabilitation institution. Here, Alex learns to survive by faking sincerity and repentance. However, he learns of a radical new treatment for violent criminals, a controversial method of therapy in which the subject is put through a rigorous series of experiments that ultimately suppress their desire to act criminally. Sensing a chance of early release, Alex facetiously volunteers to undergo the treatment. But when the therapy is over, he finds that he has lost more than his violent tendencies  even his basic human thought processes, his ability to make moral choices, have been taken away too.<br/><br/>McDowell gives a career-best performance as the sadistic narrator, terrifying in the film's horrific first half and oddly pitiable in the more philosophical second. His character is the fulcrum upon which the whole film depends  if his character doesn't work, then neither does the movie. Happily the actor passes with flying colours. Kubrick shoots each scene with characteristic meticulousness, generating horror when he wants horror, comedy when he wants comedy, and thought when he wants thought. The film's many images and philosophies resonate long afterwards, mainly due to the way Kubrick works them into our mind. A Clockwork Orange has a reputation for extreme violence (having been withdrawn by Kubrick himself for over twenty five years), but it is a more implied kind of violence rather than the visceral blood-spattering common to recent films. Much of what makes this film so disturbing takes place off screen, often in the viewer's own mind. It is a film to challenge our way of thinking, and as such a wonderfully provocative and worthwhile piece of cinema."
"Galina_movie_fan","10","4","6","27 November 2006"," ""Horoshiy Malchik"" Malcolm McDowell
","""He is enterprising, aggressive, outgoing, young, bold, and vicious. He'll do"" - and that's exactly whom Malcolm McDowell played in Stanley Kubrick's ""A Clockwork orange"" (1971).<br/><br/>It is not easy to work with a genius (and this is genius at work here, no doubt. Nobody does it like Kubrick and we will never see his like again.) No matter how many roles Malcolm McDowell has played he will be thought of and always compared to the sadistic Ludwig Van's fan, a Clockwork orange from Stanley Kubrick's timeless masterpiece. Based on Alex, McDowell was invited to play Caligula in notoriously scandalous 1979 biography of the mad Roman Emperor. Watching McDowell playing Guy Cesar Caligula, one can only imagine that the movie could've been a masterpiece  McDowell plays the same Alex who was born 2000 years ago and for three years had an access to the Absolute Power that had absolutely corrupted him. Well, as we all know, ""Caligula"" is not exactly a masterpiece but it does not make McDowell's work in the movie any less interesting.<br/><br/>For me, though, the favorite McDowell's performance is everyman Mick Travis from Lindsay Anderson's stunning ""O Lucky Man!"" the young man with a conquering irresistible smile who just wanted to succeed.<br/><br/>I watched ""Clockwork Orange"" a few weeks ago and thought that I would mention Malcolm McDowell. Yes, the film is the product of Kubrick's cosmic vision and inhuman talent but without McDowell it would not have been the same."

","Undoubtedly one of the best films of the 70's. Set in the closer-than-you-think future ""Clockwork"" tells the brooding and sometimes brutal story of Alex (a tour- de-force by Malcolm McDowell) the ring leader of a group of thugs who think nothing of wreaking havoc for the sheer heck of it. The story takes a drastic turn when Alex is set up by his cohorts to take the rap for what would have been their biggest haul. Once incarcerated, he submits to an experimental form of rehabilitation that changes his behavior to that of a model citizen--or does it? Transcending conventional sci-fi, ""ACO"" comes off more as a commentary on the slow decay of ""civilized"" society (the moral subtexts are too numerous to mention), with many unforgettable images. To fully appreciate the film's message, you should watch it more than once, if only to comprehend the futuristic lingo of Alex and hs ""droogs."" Add a wonderful score featuring the likes of Beethoven and and you get a classic film in more ways than one."
"WriterDave","9","7","13","21 November 2005"," Hilarious Black Comedy
","If ever there was an over-rated Kubrick film, for my money, ""Clockwork Orange"" is probably it. I may be unfairly judging it because so many things since its initial release from any number of films glorifying violence to similarly themed bloody satires like ""Natural Born Killers"" or ""Fight Club"" to the pop phenomenon of gangster-rap have repeated the same message. What I prefer to do is view the film as I think it should be, a brilliant black comedy.<br/><br/>There is maddening genius on display here amongst the anarchy in Kubrick's film adaptation of the controversial novel. From the quasi-futuristic set designs to the hilarious speech of the characters to the outlandish costumes, ""Clockwork Orange"" presents a future that doesn't seem that far-fetched, so we the viewer develop a certain familiar comfort level with the oddly off kilter surroundings we find ourselves in. The culture of fear it presents where elderly citizens and an incompetent government cower to roving bands of ultra-violent hooligans isn't that far removed from say, oh, I don't know, present day France or even America in some ways.<br/><br/>What makes the film go down so well despite some of its shocking depictions of rape, violence, and torture, is that it never preaches to the viewer. Yes, there is something to be said about a culture of fear in an over-developed nation leading to an erosion of civil liberties and a totalitarian government parading as democracy....but let's face it, this film is in it more for the laughs (the facial expressions on Malcolm McDowell and Patrick Magee are especially uproarious), as its closing scenes will tell. Alex, was cured, alright, but we the viewers may never be."
"theskylabadventure","4","9","18","10 June 2007"," Overbaked and overrated
","The fact that this film is still held in such high regard is surely one of the greatest mysteries in cinema.<br/><br/>For the record, I love the book. It would be easy, then, to dismiss my disliking of the film as being no more than that I preferred my own vision of the story upon reading it. Alas, my reasons for not liking the film go far beyond this.<br/><br/>Firstly, and perhaps most significantly, I do not like Malcolm McDowell's reading of Alex at all. I find him tacky, annoying and not in the least fearsome. To be fair, Burgess wrote the infuriatingly tacky lingo that Alex uses in his relentless narration throughout the film, but I don't remember him describing Alex as an annoying, whiney Northerner.<br/><br/>It is not just the performance of Alex's character that misses the mark for me. Almost everyone in the film seems to think they're in an episode of Monty Python. Yes, I know it's meant to be satirical, but it's more parodical than anything. We're not laughing with it, we're laughing at it. You could be forgiven for assuming that every actor here thinks they're in a stage production and that we won't understand their character unless they shout and overact their way through each scene.<br/><br/>The production design is possibly an even greater crime. Rather than looking futuristic, the whole film looks so stuck in the '60s that I can't help but be completely detached from the action. The colour is overwhelming and the lighting only serves to enhance the feeling that this is a cheap TV movie, not a ""classic"" Warner production.<br/><br/>Don't even get me started about the cheesy, electronic renderings of Beethoven that plague almost every scene. What on earth were they thinking? Surely they knew that by using ""state-of-the-art"" synthesisers they were condemning the film to being out of date within five years. To begin with the music is mildly amusing. Soon it becomes tedious. Then downright annoying, like everything else in the film.<br/><br/>Quite simply, I just cannot take this film seriously. It has no impact whatsoever. Part of the film's longevity in the minds of moviegoers is said to be the controversy and the powerful, disturbing tone of the movie. Frankly, I found Bambi more disturbing, and a damn sight less tedious.<br/><br/>On that note, let me not forget how long, slow paced and drawn out every single scene is. By the 90 minute mark the film has gone past boring into something completely new. Needless to say, when the film finally ends, you'll find yourself struggling to resist the urge to follow Alex in jumping straight out the nearest window."

","His films have impact. So does a sledge-hammer. Many years ago they used to knock me out; nowadays they give me a serious headache.

No. Are they works of genius ? No."" Bang on. (I've rectified the last word from ""yes"" to ""no"".) ""All his movies suffer from having horrible characters"". That's right on the button, and it applies to Clockwork Orange, just as much as to the rest of them. Or more so. Horrible, horrible characters. I can hardly think of a single person in any of his films who is at all attractive or worthwhile. They are almost always pathetic and/or despicable, empty and ugly inside. There must have been something wrong with Stanley: obsessive-compulsive, depressed and depressing. Someone to avoid.<br/><br/>Burgess explained that ""clockwork orange"" means a man (""orang"") wound up and driven by clockwork. That was Kubrick's vision of existence and humanity. Man at the mercy of machines, and little more than a machine himself, an apparatchik in a bureaucracy, a cog in a system, manipulating other machines, by trickery or force. Clockwork Orange is also even more visually disgusting than some of the others.

"cwarne_uk","1","20","48","28 January 2003"," Kubricks' celebration of violence. 0/100.
","It is abundantly clear that Kubrick was a film-maker of genius. This genius was not balanced by anything resembling a moral sense. This film with it's synchonized beatings and hilarious in-out rape scenes are indication of a creator who was so in love with the image that what was actually shown doesn't matter, as long as it looked good. (Think of the whole of ""2001"".) There is a scene in this film where a middle aged woman is raped and beaten to death with the huge phallus she keeps as a work of ""art"". In many ways this is the crucial scene in the film. It is much changed from the book - but only in ways that make us feel that she was just getting her just rewards. Kubrick loads the dice so much that he is at this point more manipulative than Spielberg or Disney would ever dare. Are we supposed to think that a woman ( who quite obviously in the context has no man about the house ) who keeps giant phalli around is just asking for it - YES is quite clearly what Kubrick felt. Why does the film do this. Is it because Kubrick was a violence loving mysoginist. There is no evidence I have to say yes to that. The only answer that I can come up with is that Kubrick just liked the way it looked. That scene though is just typical of a film which dehumanises victims, family and everybody else. The only character allowed the merest semblance of life is Alex - our hero. Even if you appreciate the glorification of the thug, this is still not a good film. Most of it looks like some godforsaken mix of Lindsay Anderson and Ken Russell. The acting is constantly abysmal in that way that only British actors seem able to achieve. To sum up this is pornographic film making posing as a statement about free will. Your still allowed to like it, but be honest with yourself why.<br/><br/>Incidentally the director of this film finished his career with a 3 hour snoozefest suggesting that adultery was somehow equivalent to murde.

","OK, I'm sorry, but after watching this film twice, I still can not see why film critics love it. Truthfully, I am not a huge Kubrick fan, he's a little too artsy for me, this film is so extremely graphic when it doesn't need to be. The scene where his crew sexually assault a woman did not have to that detailed. It takes a good director to be able to get his/her point across without showing everything. For example, how could Charlie Chaplin's the Tramp get his points across without using a single word? Kubrick wanted to make it graphic to help emphasize his point, but he didn't think or care how it might effect actual victims of similar crimes. Those who think I'm being prudish have never been a victim or known one personally. The rest of the film is not near as clear as the way it is described, in fact it just meanders along with no real sense of direction at all, and ends with you scratching your head thinking, ""Is the best he could do?""

","Honestly, I was so disappointed in this movie. I have read the book, and since it got great reviews, I was expecting a fantastic rendition of the ""must read"" by Anthony Burgess. That's not what I got. The movie played down the use of the ""slang"" words so prevalent in the book. In my opinion, that makes this book stand out among other futuristic, dystopian novels. So, they barely used the lingo, and then cut out several parts from the book! Important parts, nonetheless. All in all, I found this movie extrapolated the ""weirdness"" of the book, while generally brushing off the ethical implications that Burgess brings up, as well as other underlying concepts in the book. After I watched it, I asked my friends what they thought of the movie. ""So cool!"" ""So weird; loved it!"" ""It's one of my favorite movies!"" My next question? Whether or not they had read the book. None of them had. Looks like this movie dumbs-down the book for people who haven't read it. The one thing I did like was the eyelashes they gave Alex. He looks even more haunting than I expected him to with them. But then again, the movie didn't address what they were wearing, and numerous other things people wouldn't pick up on unless it was mentioned. The director decided to dumb down the novel, and that is why I hated it so much, I think."

The main character, Alex, is a completely different person in the film than he is in the book. Burgess' character has a very likable way about him. Though he's committing acts of violence, he manages to win your heart over and you cannot help but side with him throughout. However, in Kubrick's ""masterpiece,"" Alex is an annoying, underdeveloped character that you never feel any emotions for. He's not scary, loving, funny.. he's just, there. <br/><br/>I've viewed the film before reading the book, couldn't finish it.

It drives me crazy that this is rated so highly when to me it seems like a mediocre attempt at reconstructing a real masterpiece.

Thus it's being taken from another mans words, so less than 25% of this movie is unoriginal work taken from another and throwing the author into the trash much like he did with Stephen King's the shining and most of his so called symbolism and symmetry isn't anything different than what any film school grad student loves to experiment with. He skips some of the best parts in the book including WHY THE MOVIE IS CALLED CLOCKWORK ORANGE! In fact the story's ending itself is completely destroyed by Stanly reading the American version of the book which has one less chapter that explains the pinnacle point of the entire body of art. The movie itself has become something of controversy by the amount of disturbing material but really it's just plain annoying he completely loses the whole message and symbolism of the violence choosing instead to just suffocate us with this crap.

","(from 2007): Kubrick's perfect grind-house/art-house ""tour-de-force"" (I think that term could apply here), on a big screen, is the way to go. Seeing the print emphasized the 'grind-house' aspect, as it was spotty and scratchy as s**t, but it added to the appeal of seeing it in such a lower-east-side movie theater- albeit part of a chain of theaters- and seeing it for the first time since I first saw it (probably I was 14) in full glory of the cinematic experience.<br/><br/>Certain things always pop up again and again from seeing this work of intentionally shocking, precisely over-the-top, and garishly satirical work, and while it's not like my bible or anything, the film emphasizes as always feelings that I hold very true and reticent: that free-will, notwithstanding certain typical procedures of the law if it's wrong, should not be repressed from within (see the Chaplin scenes), at least certainly not in the indifferent, mechanical process of the Ludiviko treatment.<br/><br/>It's not even really a futuristic world so much as, like with Brazil, is sort of environment where present-day fantasy meets reality (or as Zizek calls it, a nightmare), where one ends up feeling sympathy for a little devil like Alex because, quite simply, he has a lot more liveliness, humor and humanity in his form of evil than those of the government propogandists, scientists, or even the 'writer', in their form of self-aggrandizing, larger-scale evil. If anything, he's almost naive when compared to the big scheme of things- a boy getting the ultimate horror-show of a coming-of-age handed to him.<br/><br/>But thinking of Slavoj Zizek again made me double check the reasoning of the ending, and how endlessly clever Kubrick could be that having seen the film countless times I only caught on this this time: that Alex, by accepting the quasi-desperate plea from Frederick to make them look good, is still subverting himself to a form of control, even if now ""recovered"" from his treatments. The ambiguousness of the ending- of if Alex may or may not return to his life of crime or change his ways- has always been paramount for me, as it's been with many of Kubrick's films, but that little catch kept me thinking as I skipped along after the movie, singing the notorious song- the only one McDowell knew by heart."

The graphic rape scene scared me and the scene where Alex has sex with the two girls is literally a porn scene. At this scene, I wondered, ""How could a movie take such a horrific turn?"" This part had no effect on any other part of the movie. It had no relevance whatsoever to the plot. It was just thrown in there. It was such a stupid, pointless graphic sex scene that was unnecessary and made me totally disrespect the film. I don't come to movies to watch porn. I come to movies to be entertained. And I know I am only mentioning the graphic sex scenes, but those are the only parts I remembered. Everything else is a blur. Which isn't my fault, and is the film's fault. I shouldn't leave the movie remembering the parts I absolutely despised, but I did. I really don't recall the plot very much because the terrible parts are all I remember. That's all I can say. I hated this movie."
"dreadfulape","1","20","51","17 March 2005"," A unique combination of gratuitous vileness and tedious worthiness
","'Clockwork Orange' is an extravagant achievement in the cause of terrible film-making & gimcrack sociology. It is hard to imagine how such disparate elements can have been be combined into a coherent whole. Not the least of the films negative qualities is its wearisome length: 155 minutes I think in one version. Ouch! <br/><br/>The film's closest cinematic cousin is the Who & Ken Russell's hysterical nonsense 'Tommy'. That easily matches 'A Clockwork Orange' in terms of hamfisted amateur psychology & adolescent clichés about the 'the system'(does the revolting 'gay schoolmaster' figure appear in both films?) but falls far short in both nastiness and length.<br/><br/>The details of the film are all just wrong: what on earth is achieved by its twee faux dialogue? It is supposed to contribute to the rigour of the film's nastiness by showing how what to us are unpleasant concepts have been entirely inculcated into the character's thought-paths, but in fact it adds to the shonky nonsense of the physical design and costume to produce a complete absence of believable internal realism. No burglars would dress in identical white suits. Doctor Who sets were better (just less pornographic) than the celebrated Milk Bar.<br/><br/>The worst thing about the film is that the there is no way that any events in the life of the lead character, especially those subsequent to his arrest, are likely to be of any concern to the viewer. He is simply too repulsive, and deserves whatever he gets and worse. (The business about Beethoven, and its parallels in the graffitoed murals, is intended to affect this equation in some way, but its a cliché with no conviction. Ken Loach, 2 years before, gave his working-class anti-hero a bird-of-prey for similar effect, but in his case this had some believable, organic, connection with the character, rather than being a cheap symbol of 'high culture'). The film thus becomes no more than an utterly unincisive blundering satire on some imaginary penal system, which is so much like the contemporary British system of the mid 20C & its clichéd representations as to divorce the film from a sense of enlightened prediction; but so different from it as to have only the slimmest value as an out-of-date satire."
"andrew_clements","1","18","45","9 December 2004"," Disturbing Absurdity
","This film was based on a novel written by Anthony Burgess. Burgess is quite a cynical kind of satirist. Bearing that in mind, I have say, that it was the greatest load of tripe I have ever experienced. The movie was irrational,illogical and nonsensical. It was a celebration of anarchy and of humanism. In Burgess/Kubrick's opinion,to think outside the normal boundaries and restrains that have been placed upon us as society and our own conscience would constitute narrow-mindedness. To be free to explore all forms of indulgence and wickedness is to be,""enlightened"". Therefore,the average human-bean,""like you and me"", wouldn't have the capacity nor the intelligence to comprehend unless they were as broad minded us those who cast off their restrains,e.g,""Easy Rider"", another movie of its kind. As far as promiscuity goes, it was as vile as,""Cabaret"" (Of course, I could never agree with such nonsense)<br/><br/>Although there were unspoken suggestions and hints that Alex was the poor victim of societies narrow-mindedness, it wasn't until the end of the movie that audiences were made to discover that Alex didn't need curing. Not only did he resort back to his usually self but that it was wrong of us to think otherwise."

It was bold and insightful, if muddled and incoherent at times.

"Miura88","3","7","14","12 January 2010"," Kubrick's arrogance in full flight
","Kubrick has made some masterful films, highly regarded (""2001"") or underrated (""Barry Lyndon"" and ""Eyes Wide Shut"") but the only thing shocking about ""A Clockwork Orange"" is just how big a misstep Kubrick made. It's a hypocritical, pompous mess which has been idolised by the youth for its over-the-top violence and over-the-top language and hailed by others for its heard-it-all-before message.<br/><br/>After juvenile delinquent Alex (The admittedly excellent Malcolm McDowell) kills one person too many (with a statue of a penis with the other woman swinging a bust of his favourite composer Beethoven at him, oh the deliciously subtle irony of it all), he gets carted off to jail, snags himself the Ludovico treatment and is made to feel disgust every time he tries to act out on his violent and sexual urges.<br/><br/>Speaking of the violence, the majority occurs in the opening half an hour, and it would be shocking if it weren't for Kubrick's gimmicky treatment of it to add a cheaply ironic edge to it all. It just reduces the violence to a cartoon, all to smash us over the head with the fact that there's too much violence in society and we're as much to blame as the criminals for this. In effect, Kubrick has designed the film as a Ludovico treatment for the audience, but he made a complete mess of proceedings with the purposely hilarious violence: If you want to make a serious point about a serious issue, sometimes you have to put it in a serious context.<br/><br/>But it's not just the violence that is overused, Alex's voice-over simply takes away from Kubrick's storytelling abilities, ramming home every point that doesn't need to be spelt out for the audience, all until the pathetic final line of the film that's meant to be ironic but just comes across as incredibly cheesy. The worst aspect of the film? The horribly outdated synthesised soundtrack which adds another ironic tone to the violence, unnecessary, overused and just plain terrible. It all adds up to a pointless film that teaches us that violence is wrong, politicians will do anything to stay in power, prison can't always reform criminals and the youth are crazy, why tell us something we don't know already. It's not even the fact that Kubrick tries to let us come to our own decision, by purposely trying to make us laugh at the violence and then judging us for laughing at it, it's just hypocritical, forceful and downright pompous. You can't chase somebody down in your car, run them over then berate them for getting hit.<br/><br/>Overall ""A Clockwork Orange"" is a big mistake from a director who has thankfully made far better films with more subtlety and more trust in the audience. For films about the violence in society, I recommend ""Badlands"" which is better in literally every single way."
"Jacques98","10","7","14","21 January 2009"," I can't decide if it was written by a horny 12-year-old boy or a brilliant storyteller.
","People always say it's impossible not to have an overt opinion on this film100% negative or 100% positivedue to the supposed graphic content. I'm sorry to break the norm, but I really fail to see it as horrid, disgusting cinema, and I also fail to see it as a brilliant masterpiece. In some ways, I just find A Clockwork Orange an average movie that was very well directed.<br/><br/>The first hour or so seems to have been written by a teenage boy just starting to go through puberty. I fail to see anything mature whatsoever in parading infinite numbers of topless women across screen. It just seems a whole lot like a middle-aged manKubrick and/or Burgessfantasizing about all the sex he wished he could have. The prevalent penis imagery is borderline self-parody. It's something you see in American Pie and laugh at, not something you watch in ""fine cinema"" and give deep thought to. The entire first hour of A Clockwork Orange honestly had me laughing out loud because I can't understand how this could be taken as mature whatsoever.<br/><br/>This is why I failed to find anything about A Clockwork Orange even mildly perverse or upsetting. The rape scenes are all generic rape scenes that seem to happen in EVERY last 70s movie, and not one of them went into graphic detail. A Clockwork Orange didn't do anything ""perverse"" that hundreds of other movies hadn't done before it. If anything, I found the supposed sexual perversity to be very mild, even for its time. As I said, parading nude women around and having a prevalent penis aesthetic is just downright humorous when you think about it, not gruesome. It doesn't rub your face in the dirt of humanity, it's worthy of a grin.<br/><br/>The violent content is even less perverse. I don't even remember any of the hyped-up violent content whatsoever. A few old men get hit with a clubthat's literally it. There is no more blood than Star Wars (rated PG), and when there is blood it looks so unrealistic it was laughable, not disturbing. There is NOTHING even mildly violent in A Clockwork Orange at all. How did this get falsely labeled as one of the most violent films of all time? Honestly, how? If it had been made today, it would easily get a PG or PG-13 without any protest. Compared to any and every R-rated movie I've seen this year, A Clockwork Orange looks downright family friendly. If you have not seen A Clockwork Orange, take my word: this is not even a mildly violent film. At all.<br/><br/>The directing is godlike. I see no need to elaborate further, because people have done so in every single review on here. I will say, however, that, as well-done as the surrealist imagery is, it sometimes gets silly quick. More than once during the film I felt like I was watching Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory gone terribly wrong, and with less creativity. While it's fun to look at, there is nothing original about the imagery by any means. I found a lot of it bland and predictable.<br/><br/>But despite all that, the one major flaw I have with A Clockwork Orange is the pathetic liner storyline. A Clockwork Orange only gets boring a few times because Kubrick's directing and use of music is so great, but that can't make up for the hollow story. Alex himself is basically a one-dimensional idea that gets thrown around into a predicable formula according to the idealistic plot. I'm not saying I disagree with Burgess's ideology in any wayI don'tbut that doesn't make the story any less hollow and unimaginative. It always annoys me like none other when an author can think of some of the most original details for a story (like the milk bar and the slang), but the story itself is painfully unoriginal. It's the same problem most surrealist fiction suffers from, and it's still a problem here.<br/><br/>So, do I have anything positive to say whatsoever? Not really, except that A Clockwork Orange is still enjoyable purely at the entertainment level. Though I just trashed most every aspect of it, I did have a lot of fun. It's certainly nothing special, but it's not bad either. If you don't take it as a ultra-serious, die-hard-classic, then you may have as much fun watching it as you had watching your favorite Disney movie as a kid. Sweet nostalgia.<br/><br/>4/10"

","I really didn't like this movie. The main character is a rapist who lives in London England. He is in charge of a gang. He treats everybody in the gang like crap. So about 20 minutes into the movie the gang smashes milk mixed with some kind of drug (can't remember what it was, also he had just gone in to kill a woman at a house) into his face which makes him lose his vision for a while. The police pick him up and take him to jail. He is put in prison. Then while he is in prison he hears of an experiment that will make bad people good. So he participates in it. The experiment involves him watching violent images on a movie theater screen while it plays Beetoban (can't remember how you spell it) with his eyes winged open with well I forget how they made his eyes stay open. It drives him crazy. But after that he gets to go home. Some guy says something he doesn't like while he is there and he tries to beat him up but then he falls over when he tries to do it. Later his parents kick him out of their house and he ends up running elsewhere. He runs into the guys from the gang he used to lead. They're cops now. They beat him up. He ends up at a house of man who's daughter was raped and killed by him and his gang. The man doesn't recognize him at first but later he does recognize him and tries to kill him. He ends up in the hospital where the government guys who sent him to the experiment come back and release him. But then at the very end he goes back to being a rapist! That's what I hate about the movie! My cousin likes this and said, ""I liked it because it's about how you can change the way someone thinks but you can't change who they are."" I hated the ending. He should've been good at the end but he goes back to being a rapist! And that is why I give this a 1. He should've just gone away from crime and led an ordinary life but he didn't. I've actually heard it's the opposite in the book where he does give up being a rapist. Anyway that is just what I think. Although this cousin who liked it is the only person in my family that likes it."
"TheCinemaReview","10","5","9","24 November 2013"," Kubrick pushes the social boundaries and changes cinema forever with his film ""A Clockwork Orange""
","WARNING: MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!!!<br/><br/>A Clockwork Orange, directed by Stanley Kubrick starring a young Malcolm McDowell as Alex De Large. A teenager who is obsessed with rape, ultra violence and Beethoven's 9th, so in other words, one really f**ked up teenager.<br/><br/>This movie was considered a very controversial movie back in 1971 when it came out but, now a days it's not considered as controversial as it was back then. At this point we've seen and heard things a million times worse than this, not saying it takes anything away from the movie, I'm just pointing this out.<br/><br/>Anyways, one of the things I feel this movie did really well, was having you sympathize with Alex later in the movie. At the beginning of the movie when watching Alex do all these terrible things you just keep thinking to yourself, ""What the hell is wrong with him?"" but, later in the movie when all these bad things start happening to him and he's just totally helpless and unable to defend himself you become completely oblivious to what he's done to these people in the past. And rather than thinking that he deserves what's happening to him you feel really bad for him, you actually want him to go back to being his rapist, ultra-violent self.<br/><br/>I think the one person you have to give the credit to for making this movie so great is Stanley Kubrick. At this point it's no secret that Stanley Kubrick was an amazing director, he can be argued as the greatest director of all time. It's also no secret that Stanley Kubrick was unorthodox when it can to his directing style.<br/><br/>A Clockwork Orange definitely was one of those movies that just changed cinema, it pushed the social boundaries and made you question yourself for liking it. Without this movie and other Kubrick movies such as Lolita great movies such as Taxi Driver probably would have never been made because of how controversial they were.<br/><br/>So all in all this movie was amazing, it changed cinema forever and pushed the social boundaries."

","A masterpiece, a piece of art, a gem in film making are only a few ways to describe Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange. This film is sick, twisted and sadistic. Is that to say that the director is, no, it is just to say that the director is so daring that he made a film very different in which explores, the very dark side to human nature.<br/><br/>When I went to see this film's premiere at my local NY Cinema just after I finished High School, many of the people in the theater walked out after the first half hour. I didn't, I looked deeper and saw that this may be a great film. Once it ended, I wasn't sure what I had just seen, I was so blown away, I came back a couple of months later and saw it again and realised what a masterpiece it is.<br/><br/>When you watch this film, it feels like the movie is talking to you, The opening scene with Alex's face tells you that you are in for a wild ride in Alex's life, the rape scene tells you that it won't be pleasant and the ending really makes you think about your life and how lucky you are to be able to choose how to live your life.<br/><br/>The basic plot is the life of Alex DeLarge (Malcolm McDowall) and his everyday life as a normal 15 year old by day and a maniac rapist who hangs out with a gang of people like him called 'Droogs' by night. His principal interests are rape, ultra-violence and Beethoven. One day he gets arrested on behalf of his Droogs. He is sent to jail, but he gets out after volunteering for an experiment that is made to traumatise you from ultra-violence and all his main interests. He goes back to the real world outside and is traumatised of all his interests and is never able to choose his way of life. I won't tell you much more.<br/><br/>The acting in this film is excellent, I couldn't believe Malcolm McDowall didn't receive an Oscar Nomination, not many actors can play a brutal character and still manage to make you feel sorry for them. The screenplay was one of the best, from the dialogue all the way to every camera movement in this film. The direction should have won the Oscar, some of the best Direction I have ever seen. However don't waste this movie if you only look at it as a sick, twisted and sadistic movie, you need to look deeper and further into it. Yes this film is very perverse and violent, I say wait till you're at least 16 to see this film. Don't waste it."
"misses_n","10","5","9","27 February 2008"," A Clockwork Orange is one of the most disturbing, yet lovable films ever created.
","Brutal violence, vicious rape, cold-blooded murder, sadistic revenge; Stanley Kubrick's 1971 classic A Clockwork Orange has it all. Few films are as successfully disturbing yet sensational as this timeless feat of cinematic vision. It is impossible to watch A Clockwork Orange without having a deep, emotional response; whether it is disgust, shock or amazement.<br/><br/>Malcolm McDowell played the title character Alexander DeLarge, a sadistic, nihilistic youth who, along with his three droogs, runs rampant in an unfettered spree of violence, rape and robbery. Mr. McDowell's performance is amazing, successfully portraying a character you initially despise, but by the film's final moments, you truly sympathize with and care for. The tremendous acting is accompanied by a riveting story, based on a terrifying, yet beautiful adaptation of Anthony Burgess' 1962 satiric, futuristic novel of the same name.<br/><br/>The main theme of the story revolves around the topic of free-will and good vs. evil. The main character, Alex, is boundless in evil and chaos. When Alex is eventually captured and imprisoned, he volunteers for a controversial new government sponsored program called the The Ludovico Technique. Alex endures one of the most traumatizing procedures ever shown on film; indeed, it is difficult to watch Alex go through it, even knowing the trauma he has inflicted on others. In effect, he is injected with an experimental serum, bound in a straight-jacket, fastened to a seat in a movie theater and has his eyes pried open with metal clamps. He is then forced to view reel after reel of ultra-violent film footage, from gang rape to Nazi extremism. Alex would normally enjoy these types of films, in fact, Alex is quoted in the movie as saying, ""I just don't understand about feeling sick the way I did. I never used to feel sick before. I used to feel like the very opposite. I mean doing it or watching it, I used to feel real horrorshow."" The serum administered to Alex induced an acute feeling of nausea, thus, he was being conditioned much in the same way as Pavlov's drooling dogs. Whenever confronted by feelings of lust or violence, Alex experiences the overwhelming nauseous feeling, thus preventing him from acting on the violent feelings. Upon completion of the treatment, Alex is released back into the world where he encounters many of his former victims, who take advantage of the now defenseless Alex.<br/><br/>One of the most striking aspects of A Clockwork Orange is Kubrick's dazzling use of a classical score to accompany the many violent scenes. In fact, one of the most controversial moments in film history is the scene where Alex and his droogs break into an older couple's home, beat the husband, tie him up and force him to watch while Alex beats and rapes the wife, all while dancing and singing the classic song, ""Singing in the Rain."" The contrast of violence and classical music has been acclaimed by critics around the world, and brings about an ironic twist in the movie.<br/><br/>If you've never seen A Clockwork Orange, do yourself a favor and rent it today. You will be amazed and astounded by the music, philosophy, acting, characters, and story of this timeless classic."

","This film is probably the best ever made. Its superb use of music, scenery and wardrobe is one of the great highlights of modern cinema. The exploration of human psychology as much as the moral implications of free will are quintessential in Kubrick's work. Kubrick has the amusing particularity that at the end of his films, one feels like in a state of ecstasy, awaiting something else to happen. They seem to end in a ""To be continued"" mood, which leaves the viewer with profound philosophical questions. The topic of insanity which constantly arises in Kubrick's films, is nowhere best treated that in this work of art, clearly the greatest achievement by any director, dead or alive(maybe in the same rank as Fellini, Chaplin, Truffaut and the great European masters)."
"krumski","Null","5","9","12 December 2003"," Stan took a wrong turn here - and just kept going
","""Dr. Strangelove"" and ""2001:A Space Odyssey"" are in my Top 5 movies of all time, so in my book Stanley Kubrick forever has an asterisk next to his name denoting ""genius"" (his ""Lolita"" was none too shabby, either). But right here, with this movie, is where ol' Stan began - in my mind - to vanish into his own hermetically sealed vault of cinematic pretension and designer, knee-jerk nihilism. The movies he made for the remainder of his life are cold, opaque works that don't engage on any level, save for an appreciation of the technical artistry they demonstrate: meticulously constructed sarcophagi, where lie entombed the spirit of a once-puckish, daring, and wonderfully *alive* filmmaker.<br/><br/>At least with `Clockwork' Stan still retained the power to provoke (he lost even that right after this release) - but he goes about it all wrong, and to extremely dubious ends. I should say upfront that I read the book (by Anthony Burgess) first, and it had a profound effect on me. (SPOILERS AHEAD) The first part - which chronicled Alex and the violent, pillaging activities of he and his `droogs' - filled me with such revulsion and hatred, that I took sadistic glee in seeing the `reformed' post-Ludovico Alex get his nasty comeuppance in the second half of the book. However, when the story took its final twist at the end by giving Alex his `freedom' back, I was furious. Here's a guy who (the narrative makes clear) has learned no lessons or morals from his predicament - who feels no remorse, and will doubtless return to a life of `ultraviolence' as soon as he gets the chance; I was rooting for him to remain a robotic pawn of the state. The book's fundamental challenge lies just in this: convincing (or at least presenting powerfully to) the reader that even brutes and reprobates such as Alex deserve the dignity of free will, and that there can be no justification for revoking that. (The challenge is, indeed, open-ended - inasmuch as I'm not entirely convinced; after all, isn't prison a revocation of someone's `free will', too? Isn't *any* form of punishment? But at least the book's presentation makes it an idea worth wrestling with.)<br/><br/>Kubrick's mistake, as I see it, is in making Alex such a charming and charismatic figure. In the book he's a single-minded brute; he still is in the movie, but by filtering his thoughts through the purring, dulcet tones of Malcom McDowell, and filming even his most violent and heinous acts with pop-art style brio, Kubrick leaves little doubt about his affection for this monster. Further, he does so within the context of making EVERY OTHER SINGLE CHARACTER in the movie such a caricatured and annoying drone (so much so, in fact, that it is actually *they* who become the monsters - quite a flip).<br/><br/>
As such, Kubrick upsets the entire balance of the piece (at least as Burgess envisioned it). We get no sense of Alex's crimes against humanity - because, in fact, there's no `humanity' here: only the kind of ciphers and waxwork grotesqueries that would become Kubrick's definition of `character' for the remainder of his career. Perhaps that's his point, after all (no doubt it is): that, in fact, under a bogus sense of decorum, society consists of nothing but droning, annoying hypocrites, and there's no use in spilling a tear for any single one of them. But when you are watching a woman being violently raped and you are made to feel nothing for her - not to mention her brutalized husband (who gets absolutely savaged by the director later in the film) - then something rather sick and insidious is going on.<br/><br/>
Burgess' book was written as a warning against the dangers of social engineering, no matter how well-intentioned. Kubrick's movie plays more as a blatant indictment of humanity as a whole. Its underlying, none-too-subtle message is that in a society so plastic and corroded only violently murderous free spirits like Alex are truly worth anything: he may not be nice, but at least he's not dead inside like every other single person on the planet.<br/><br/>Personally, I think the only humanity Kubrick ends up indicting by such an approach is his own. But then that's just me, isn't it."

","""A Clockwork Orange"" is my favorite novel of all time. Before watching the movie I wondered if it would do justice to the novel. Well, it didn't. The movie was basically a porno version of the novel. Kubrick's aim seems to have been to take a philosophically meaningful story and incorporate as much female nudity into it as possible. Why? I guess it was avant-garde or something. I think there were a couple occasions on which bare ""groodies"" were possibly warranted. Other than that, the nudity was over-the-top and cheesy.<br/><br/>People talk about how disturbing the violence is in ""A Clockwork Orange."" Disturbing violence? I really didn't see any. What did masquerade as violence reminded me of the old ""Tom and Jerry"" show. Most of the violence consisted of Alex and his droogs tapping each other and their victims with canes, but the bizarre sound effects during these scenes told the viewer to see this as brutal. In another scene Alex raises a phallic sculpture in order to clobber a crazy cat-lady, but you don't actually see him hitting her with it; instead, you are shown something that looks a bit like cartoon fireworks. Then the rape scenes are always accompanied by upbeat music which just makes them seem comical. The violence in the book was truly disturbing, but I don't see how you are supposed to take violence in this movie seriously.<br/><br/>The book had a theme, which was that a person's most important right is being able to think and choose for himself, and nobody has the right to take that away from him regardless of the consequences. In its truly ridiculous final scene, the movie obliterated that theme by choosing to focus on and glorify Alex's sexual fantasies, as if he was some sort of perverted superhero. Thus the point the movie inadvertently seems to end up making is that if the government doesn't stop people, they will just go out and perform deviant acts, but deviance is so much fun that the government shouldn't try to stop them. This completely undermines the message of the book.<br/><br/>In short, the novel is a literary masterpiece. The movie is a hypersexualized, cartoonish version of that masterpiece, practically a parody. Good thing Kubrick didn't try a film version of ""Pride and Prejudice""--wonder how that would have turned out. There are numerous things I hate about this movie, from the glow-in-the-dark jumpsuits to the fact that I will never be able to listen to the William Tell overture the same way again. But it had a few good points. It did follow the basic storyline of the book up until the end and was well acted and filmed. For that I will generously give it a 3."

"hoover23","1","13","32","31 October 2010"," A Clockwork Orange My take on the theme
","A Clockwork Orange (1971) by Stanley Kubrick, is one of the most disturbing movies that I have ever had the displeasure of watching. The film follows Alex, played by Malcolm McDowell, and his group of delinquent friends whom he calls droogs. The droogs include Pete (Michael Tarn), Georgie (James Marcus), and Dim (Warren Clarke). Alex and the droogs spend their nights terrorizing whomever they may encounter using rape, violence, and sadistic theatrics.<br/><br/>The film is narrated in a voice over fashion by Alex, as he recalls the story, and gives it to us from his point of view. Alex leads us through his violent escapades with his droogs, where they beat up a homeless man, fight a rival gang, beat up a writer and rape his wife, and break into a home of a woman and her cats where Alex beats the woman to death with a penis shaped statue. As Alex tries to escape the house his droogs turn on him, smashing a milk bottle in his face leaving him blinded to be found by the police.<br/><br/>Alex is convicted of murder and sentenced to 14 years in prison. While in prison Alex hears of a experimental therapy that could get him out of prison much quicker than the 14 years he is sentenced, naturally he signs up without really knowing what the therapy is. The experimental aversion therapy that Alex is subjected to includes being strapped in a straight jacket and being forced to watch films containing extreme violence while being given drugs to induce revulsion. During all the violent images the only sound is Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, one of Alex's favorite pieces.<br/><br/>The results of the aversion therapy are successful and Alex is immediately released from prison ""cured"" of his illness. Now when ever faced with violence or Beethoven's ninth Alex's response is to be incapacitated by revulsion. The film then leads us threw the trauma that Alex goes through at the hands of the old man that he had previously attacked, the two police officers that were his former droogs, and the writer that he had beaten and raped his wife. The film ends with Alex in the hospital as they try to successfully reverse the aversion therapy.<br/><br/>The successful use of jump cuts makes this film, which is incredibly long coming in at 137 minutes, makes the film bearable and seems shorter than it actually is.<br/><br/>To me if I had to pick a theme out for this movie, it would be one of morality. The theme focuses in on the bad things that Alex does and calls into question how far we should go to correct the bad things that people do. Another film that I believe has a theme that is connected to morality is Crash, this film focuses in on the morality of actions and the effects that can be seen later down the line."

","This contains partial spoilers, so be warned. ********************<br/><br/>My major problem with A Clockwork Orange, aside from it being pretentious and silly, was that Kubrick changed the ending from the novel.  The film ends with Alex ""reformed"" in the hospital, but Burgess' novel continues on, with Alex eventually reforming on his own.  That was the point of the novel: childhood antics are just a part of growing up, and everyone matures. Kubrick, on the other hand, of course couldn't have a positive ending in one of his movies, and thus lost the plot entirely."

I'm sorry but guys walking around with jumpsuits and underwear on just isn't my cup of tea. It was a good story line but it just lacked everything that would keep me awake during a film and I honestly don't understand why people think this movie is so great. ""OH MAN, HE KILLED HER WITH A GIANT PENIS!!!"" I'm sorry but giant penises and elderly women don't make a great movie.

"blank_tyler87","5","6","12","21 July 2004"," Disappointing at best
","Before I am harshly attacked verbally for this review, let me begin by stating that I think Kubrick has done some brilliant work. I absolutely loved ""Space Oddyssey"", ""Lolita"", and ""The Shining"", but something about this one didn't sit right. The plot sounds like an interesting idea: the leader of a terrible violent gang is arrested and forced to partake in a new form of criminal therapy. The end result is that he becomes ill at the very thought of a violent or sexual action, and as a side-effect suffers the same effect upon hearing Beethoven's music. So why would such an excellent and creative idea turn up such bad results? The ""ultra-violence"" is indeed disturbing, but to be honest I couldn't care less about any of these characters. Malcolm MacDowell does a mediocre job playing the main character and hence I found it hard to even care about the story. I found the movie shocking and disturbing, but not good. Disturbing and graphic movies I've enjoyed before such as ""Se7en"" or ""Reservoir Dogs"" managed to create characters I was interested in and could care about. However the below-average performance of Alex completely negated any and all chances of enjoying this film. If I didn't feel the need to sit through it all and not form a full opinion until the end, I would've turned the film off before falling asleep from complete boredom with the characters."

"Otoboke","9","4","7","2 October 2007"," Memorably off the wall
","I think I may have just found my new favourite director.<br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick outstrips himself yet again with a fantastic piece of film based upon the novel 'A Clockwork Orange' written by Anthony Burgess. Filled with superb acting, direction, dialogue and absolutely timeless photography; Clockwork Orange is a true masterpiece, often defining at every moment exactly why we watch movies.<br/><br/>Throughout we are treated a whole ensemble of fantastic and sometimes zany performances from the whole cast, with special mention to McDowell in the lead role as the ever deranged and sadistic Alex DeLarge. This is perhaps my favourite feature of the movie and is indeed an absolute treat from beginning to end to watch McDowell go through nearly every emotion imaginable with uttermost believability and conviction. Not only this but there are some characters I will never forget because of the their seemingly surreal and disorientated nature that defies all reality or even normality, if there is even such a thing in Kubrick's directorial palette. This is quite a bit to do with their actual dialogue actually, often showcasing very proper and old English grammar, which contrasts the very nature of the scenes it is being used in to grand effect.<br/><br/>This is also why I often found myself chuckling during quite a few scenes in the film. Whether it was seeing DeLarge bending over to have his anus inspected or the over-the-top nature of the officer in charge of his cell-block (whom often reminded me of John Cleese of Monty Python fame of all things), I loved the odd breaks in drama for a bit of tongue in cheek, dark witty humour often left out of such films.<br/><br/>This however is probably not why A Clockwork Orange is hailed as the classic it is today. Instead it is the completely believable and realistic portrayal of torture and violence born in a very bleak and not so distant dystopian society. The whole affair is brought to life accordingly and very successfully through the main characters and their distinctive obsessions of mindless violence and rape. It is these themes and many others present during the film that makes it one of the most thought provoking and emotionally startling films ever made to date. With his previous film Kubrick sought to provoke the mind, but with Clockwork, he goes mainly for the heart and strikes emotions that are very rarely or only mildly touched on by any other movies.<br/><br/>Another couple of things before I wrap this up: the camera work and photography are again beautiful and Kubrick's unique vision comes across vividly in the film, creating a world not easily forgettable. Furthermore -and another trademark of his- is the perfect use of classical music where it is needed, creating a brilliant soundtrack instantly recognisable from all others.<br/><br/>So there you have it, just a few reasons why this movie will more than likely having you gripped, with your eyes unable to move away from the screen, whether you like it or not. And yes, you'll probably walk away quite a different person than you were when you sat down. That's the mark of a great film, and that is exactly what Stanley Kubrick does with A Clockwork Orange, showing why he was one of the finest directors of modern cinema."
"DJMo","9","4","7","14 February 2003"," A stylish interpretation of Burgess's dystopian novel -OR- misogynist art porn masquerading as relevant social commentary? (possible spoilers)
","Perhaps a bit of both.  While the visual shock of the ""ultraviolence"" has diminished over time, the inherent perversity of the acts and the aloof demeanor and sociopathic sadism and apathy of the droogs can still elicit responses of disgust and repulsion from viewers.  However, the almost comic tone and musical-like choreography in Kubrick's presentation leave others wondering exactly how to react and undermine the perceived severity of the crimes being committed.  Nevertheless, Malcolm Macdowell effectively captures the amoral essence of Alex on-screen, his charismatic and well-mannered veneer belying his perverted and ingrained sociopathic tendencies.  After an arrogant power trip and betrayal by his disillusioned droogs, Alex goes to prison.  There, he learns of and enrolls in an experimental aversion therapy program in an effort to rehabilitate himself (although it is unclear if his motives are to get better or to get out of jail more quickly).  The tables are then turned on Alex, and the viewer is shown that the inhumanity of society's punishment is as repulsive as the depravity of Alex's crimes.  The film raises a variety of socially relevant questions: Is society truly able to ever rehabilitate criminals? (is this Alex's case solely, or youth in general?) What are the dangers of allowing society to remove free will in exchange for security?  What means, if any, are useful and/or justifiable to change the inherent nature of a person? With increased fear in the present age, societally and self-imposed suspensions of freedom, and recent phenomena like the reprehensible idea of ""the criminal as victim"", Burgess's prescience and Kubrick's provocative vision of Burgess's dystopia seem quite relevant and foreboding."
"sigil","Null","4","7","10 June 1999"," Scary comments
","There are probably far too many comments concerning this movie already, but I'll advance one more. I'd always heard what a 'dreadful' and 'violent' movie ""Clockwork Orange"" was.  It debuted while I was still in early high school; I didn't actually see it until quite a few years later.  I do remember, incredibly, my first introduction to it in the form of a parody from ""Mad"" magazine.  Though silly, I recall the MAD spoof as being amazingly reminiscent on the whole. However, I have seen the real thing now, twice; I've read the user comments from the IMDB site.  And I have to say this:  The movie didn't particularly frighten me in regard to the rape-and-ultra-violence scenes.  Though of course quite troubling, those were inherently part of the story about a disturbed society and its even more disturbed methods of dealing with the above. What did scare me a bit were some of the comments I read.  I would have to say that any people who think this movie ""boring"" or otherwise un-stimulating, are people I want to stay very far away from.<br/><br/>A pattern seems to emerge:  These individuals appear to regularly watch movies that are chock-full of totally gratuitous violence.  Then, having heard what a Terribly Violent film it is, they approach ""A Clockwork Orange"" in anticipation of more of the same. They are invariably disappointed -- the reason being that there is really little or no 'violence for violence's sake' in the film.  In fact, as a person who decidedly does NOT get off on movie violence, I'd say there is no more than there has to be to help get the very disturbing points of the movie across.  ""A Clockwork Orange"" could easily have been a great deal worse in that regard -- and apparently, some people are let down that it wasn't. So, to such people I suppose I'd have to say this:  If you want gratuitous, mindless, and really horrible violence, rent ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" or any of the dozens of other, equally insane films -- including some animated ones -- that have come out since then. But if that's the kind of thing that works for you, don't bother renting ""A Clockwork Orange"".  Violence may be the theme of this movie, but it is NOT the message."

I can also now never again think of a horse race when I hear the William Tell Overture (if you've seen the movie, you know what I mean.).  Also, the movie seemed to move along very slowly.

"SnorriGodhi","2","7","15","30 May 2006"," That Chaplain sticks in my throat
","One problem with this movie is that senseless violence is depicted as glamorous. (This is obviously less of a problem after Pulp Fiction and Sin City.) Speaking for myself, I find this to be only a minor problem.<br/><br/>My main problem is different: the movie raises an important issue, but deals with it in a confused and illogical manner. The issue is whether something like the Ludovico treatment, if feasible, would be ethical. For those who have not yet seen the movie, the Ludovico treatment is a (fictional) conditioning process, by which a violent criminal comes to associate the sight of violence with strong nausea. The purpose is to make the criminal practically unable to use violence ever again.<br/><br/>Presumably, the Prison Chaplain speaks for Burgess and Kubrick when he complains that the Ludovico treatment is unethical because it robs the patient of his free will: the patient avoids violence because he fears nausea, not because he has changed his ethical outlook.<br/><br/>What the Chaplain says is well phrased, as can be seen in the ""memorable quotes"" section. It is also very silly. It is silly because it assumes that people who try to avoid nausea have lost their free will.<br/><br/>Imagine a criminal who has been to jail and has abandoned crime because he fears going back to jail: does this mean that the threat of jail deprives people of their free will? Imagine also a man who experiences nausea after tasting Bearnaise sauce in a restaurant: this man is unlikely to eat Bearnaise sauce again, but can he sue the restaurant for depriving him of his free will (as opposed to suing for food poisoning)? If the answer to both questions is no, then a man who abandons crime because he fears nausea has not lost his free will, either.<br/><br/>On the other hand, if the answer to either question is yes, that means that people lose their free will when they have to suffer the consequences of their actions. So this is what the Chaplain's tirade amounts to: there is no free will if people suffer any consequences from their actions; and therefore there is no free will in the real world. It sounds absurd if put in these words, but this is the only way I can make sense of what the Chaplain says.<br/><br/>It might be argued that there is a qualitative difference between fear of prison and nausea: the two emotions activate different brain pathways, for instance. There can be reasonable disagreement on the differences between the Ludovico treatment and prison, and there is plenty of room for debate on this issue. The fact is that the movie does not even begin to address the issue! The Chaplain does not explain why he is opposed to the Ludovico treatment, but not to prison. Nothing in the movie suggests any reason to prefer prison to the Ludovico treatment; if anything, the Ludovico treatment is portrayed as faster and more effective in reducing crime. This brings me back full circle to my starting point: the movie raises an important issue, but deals with it in a confused and illogical manner.<br/><br/>In spite of all this, I was entertained by the movie: there is an interesting story and stylish cinematography, as one would expect from Kubrick. The violence is unpleasant, but it is not gratuitous: it shows what kind of person the main character is, and what kind of people he hangs around with. But at the end of the movie, what remains in my mind, and sticks in my throat, is the Chaplain's speech. I perceive it as an insult to the intelligence of the audience. Should I be more disturbed by the violence? I don't think so, because the violence is fictional, while the silly ideas that the Chaplain is advocating can do serious damage to an impressionable mind."

","In the 37 years since I saw A CLOCKWORK ORANGE I have always staunchly offended this stupid movie. I loathed it then and after seeing it again recently I loathe it even more. Why? it is BORING.

A CLOCKWORK ORANGE is and always will be a terrible film; a vicious misuse of character, slyly pathetically trying to present a poncy vandal murderer as some witty ant-hero (yawn) and using classic music and songs as a defiant act of cine vandalism. An absolute no brainer to simply invert dignity and humanity and then bash it all together with stark sets and overalls. It is so unimaginative. And ugly. and did I say BORING.... it just goes on and on .. and even in slow motion! for hours. A CLOCKWORK ORANGE only has a future if remade as A CLOCKWORK CHUCKY and adds Bart Simpson rolling it all into a dumb pop satire of silly-Chucky doll grimace and Simpson's awareness. In 2011 when A CLOCKWORK ORANGE is 40 years old it will just again look as wasteful and bereft of creativity as it always did. Hopeless. What a con it was and still is.

"majikstl","5","9","21","29 May 2004"," Violent actions, violent reactions...
","According to IMDb.com, Stanley Kubrick had exhibition of A CLOCKWORK ORANGE stopped in the United Kingdom after his family received death threats protesting the film. There is a certain irony here: Kubrick's film at the very least trivializes violence and maybe even glamorizes it, but Kubrick himself didn't seem to recognize the power and the influence that stylized violence has, until it posed a real threat to him and his family.<br/><br/>A CLOCKWORK ORANGE is undoubtedly a fascinating film to watch. Its creation of a bizarre, pop-art, surrealistic, vaguely futuristic world is, as you'd expect from Kubrick, meticulous and detailed. The film fulfills a daring, conceptually bold vision of a world that is violent, superficial and coldly impersonal. In essence, a somewhat more colorful version of the type of world with which Kubrick became increasingly fascinated. And, as in the Kubrick style, the more obsessively intense the appearance of the film, the more progressively shallow it is thematically and philosophically. Like much of Kubrick's work, A CLOCKWORK ORANGE is about how something is said, but not all that interested in what is actually being said.<br/><br/>The film is not just about violence, but about the theatrics of violence. The acts of violence are just that, acts -- i.e., performances -- of violence. Some of this is obvious: a gang rape happens on a theatre stage and another rape is performed as the main character parodies ""Singin' in the Rain."" Other instances are less obvious, but still apparent as Kubrick takes great pains to control angle, lighting and image to make the attacks ""ultra-violent,"" but in a photogenic way. We don't see the violence as realistic, but in a jazzed up cinematic way. Terrible things happen to otherwise innocent people, but Kubrick isn't interested in their suffering, but in the calculated high his protagonist and his fellow thugs get as they commit crimes -- and the calculated high he wants the audience to have as they watch. <br/><br/>ORANGE's anti-hero is Alex (Malcolm MacDowell). Alex is a rapist and a murder and God-only-knows what else. Kubrick wants Alex to be seen as the film's victim. To this end, Alex is arrested and, during the course of the film, reprogrammed to abhor violence. This, it seems, makes Alex a helpless victim in the real world, much like the helpless victims he terrorized during the first half of the film. The difference is that Alex is the victim of a big, mean, horrible government that has left him stripped of his free will, while Alex's various victims were, well, secondary characters; important as props, but little else. Kubrick seems oblivious to the fact that his argument in favor of individual freedom has little respect for most of its individual characters. <br/><br/>A CLOCKWORK ORANGE is unique in the world of film, there is nothing quite like it. But, unfortunately, it is very typically Kubrick. Like an architect or interior designer who strives to be an artist, Kubrick creates a world that is stunning visually, but coldly inhospitable. He is so obsessed with having every frame of his movies looking just so, that he neglects to create worlds where there is room for anything as messy as humanity. Even in a film like ORANGE with its defense of free will at any cost, Kubrick himself seems to fear anything as uncontrollable as spontaneity. His plea for free will is cold and mechanical. <br/><br/>Kubrick's message is that being robbed of free will by the state is far worse of a crime than rape or murder or any other act of violence. Which, in theory, is a noble philosophy, assuming you have not been a victim of rape or murder or any other act of violence. Whether in the real world or the reel world, violence always robs its victims of their free will, and in far more oppressive ways than suffered by Alex. It is sad and somewhat telling that Kubrick wants to work up a great deal of pity for a shallow monster like Alex, who essentially is stripped of his dubious right to do harm, but the director can't seem to muster up anything but a passing interest in the people who are harmed by Alex. Kubrick seems to respect Alex as a man of action, albeit antisocial action, over the benign passivity of his victims.<br/><br/>ORANGE doesn't really condone violence, but it doesn't condemn it either. The film sees violence as a moral choice, something for the individual to accept or reject. Which would be fine, if the film also recognized that such choices come with responsibilities and consequences. What most people would see as justice -- Alex losing his freedom to chose his life's options -- the film sees as oppression. Whether you want to see it as chaos, anarchy, amorality or just plain stupidity, the film's seemingly high-minded defense of personal freedom is noble only if you are devoid of basic human compassion. That is, you are willing to place intellectual theory over simple human dignity. I suspect that Kubrick -- like the makers of other ""ultra-violent"" films, from THE WILD BUNCH to NATURAL BORN KILLERS -- thought he was making a bold statement about our violent society, creating ""art,"" but foolishly he didn't seem to grasp that such ""art"" is what helps to make a society violent in the first place. Unquestioned violence begets indefensible violence. <br/><br/>Art should be the antithesis of violence and even violent art should mock or repudiate violence. Maybe that idea finally hit home when Kubrick moved to suppress the film in order to protect his family."
"scharnbergmax-se","1","16","43","10 February 2004"," The Most Unethical Movie Produced Since the Second World War
","Almost all commentators have for two generations bestowed unmixed praise on this movie. I do not deny its technical merits. But it is impossible to arrive at a fair evaluation, without taking into account the secret propagandistic aim. The film was intended as a weapon in a protracted and still unfinished war within psychology and psychiatry. One of the fighting sides consists of psychodynamic therapists, or for short, psychotherapist. Their procedures are to a greater or lesser extent based on psychoanalysis. The other side consists of the behaviour therapists, whose approach is based on learning theory. During 40 years I have encountered no more than two persons who have pointed out the flaws of A Clockwork Orange'. One was the late Professor Hans-Jürgen Eysenck at London University. I myself am the other one. I discussed the movie in my doctoral thesis in 1984, and once more in The Non-Authentic Nature of Freud's Observations' (2 vol., 1993). The latter is acknowledged as one of the most important writings within the trend of modern Freud criticism, which started in the 1990s. If we want to grasp the real nature of the movie, we cannot avoid a careful scrutiny of the context in which the movie is embedded. We must direct our attention toward many facts which at the first glance seem to have no relation to the movie. I ask the reader to be patient; in due course I shall justify my `digression'. - - - Psychoanalysis was created by Sigmund Freud around 1895. Freud boasted that psychoanalytic treatment will not merely cure some, but each and every neurotic patients. In addition, it will provide a life-time guarantee against relapse. (Anyone doubting that Freud said such foolish lies may take a look at Gesammelte Werke, vol. XI, pp. 467-469.) One of his further (and equally mendacious) claims is that he and his followers have gathered a wealth of highly surprising clinical observations, which provide foolproof evidence of the theory. For almost a century Freud's followers repeated these claims. Not until the last ten years have they been forced to admit the truth, viz. that treatment has no therapeutic effect; that all non-trivial observations were faked; and that many of Freud's alleged patients did not even exist. - - - It may be debated whether behaviour therapy started in 1924 or 1904. But there is scientific proof that the treatment is highly efficacious. And while the normal duration of psychotherapy is measured in years, the duration of behaviour therapy is measured in weeks. Psychotherapists rightly perceived it as a dangerous rival. For many decades they succeeded in keeping it away from psychic clinics. However, thanks to Professor Eysenck the existence of behaviour therapy could no longer be concealed after 1960. The result was an immense reduction of patients seeking psychotherapy. The members of this profession suffered great economic problems. Their first counter attack was to start a world-wide campaign against behaviour therapy. There are specific reasons why it was easy to start such a campaign. It had always been the goal of psychotherapists to convert their patient into a true believer of psychoanalysis. And they had usually succeeded with this goal, even if the patients had not been cured. Many former patients held influential key positions: university teachers, reporters, writers of fiction, movie directors. Newspapers disseminated the lie that behaviour therapists treat bed-wetting children with electric shocks. Quite a few of my own university teachers asserted that behaviour therapists aim at transforming their patients into automatons without emotions. A CLOCKWORK ORANGE' IS PART OF THIS HIGHLY UNETHICAL CAMPAIGN. THE AIM IS TO DISSUADE SICK PEOPLE FROM TURNING TO THE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE BEHAVIOUR THERAPY FOR HELP. INSTEAD, THEY SHOULD GO TO PSYCHOTHERAPISTS, THEREBY SAVING THEM FROM ECONOMIC HARDSHIP. - - - Now look at Kubrick's movie, but not with eyes wide shut. A key theme is that the government has decided to apply behaviour therapy to criminals. What motive is attributed to the government? Is the aim to reduce the rate of relapse among convicts and, hence, to reduce the number of future victims of crimes? Oh no! Is humanitarian concern involved as regards a young boy who is serving a 14-year prison sentence? Oh no! If we may believe Mr. Kubrick, the government consists of scoundrels who needs the prisons for detaining their political opponents. Therefore it is imperative to empty the prisons rapidly of ordinary criminals. For this purpose behaviour therapy comes as a godsend gift. - The evil-minded parody of the outcome of the treatment depicted in the movie, is not even possible in homo sapiens. The boy invariably starts with strong aggressive feelings and with preparation for a violent action. Only as a second step is he overwhelmed by nausea. - There are many other things Kubrick and his writer would prefer the spectator not to notice. First, the troubles the boy experienced after release from the prison, are not in the least a result of the treatment. These troubles would not have occurred, if mass media had not given widespread publicity to his case and, without any respect of anonymity, informed the whole country that from now on it is safe to perform aggressive acts against this boy. Second, prior to the conviction the boy used to beat up peoples just for fun, with minor consequences for himself until a woman was killed for fun'. After he was released, each of his former victims was satisfied with performing one single act of retaliation. It would not take many days before he was through with all the retaliatory acts. And afterwards he had no reason to fear further violence. Third, who would sincerely claim that keeping the boy in prison for 14 years would be a more humane treatment? - Two final questions to the reader: Do you think that the description of the war within psychology is a superfluous digression? Do you think that users, reviewers and experts should not bother about the Kubrick's evil-minded aim, when they evaluate the movie?"

","I never thought a movie could be more overrated than Fargo. Tonight, after throwing away two hours of my life, I stand corrected. This is the most overrated movie in history. I don't mind wasting time with mediocre movies because I don't expect them to be good. However, what really bothers me is that this piece of garbage is ranked 60 on IMDb when there are so many underrated superior movies out there in practically every aspect. Anyone who thinks this movie is a master piece of cinematography is just trying too hard to be artsy and intellectual. I honestly can't think of any positive aspect of this movie, poor acting, horrible setting, poor camera job, over-used nudity. Seriously, what was the director smoking when he came up with this thing? If you want to see a violent movie with a strong message, go watch American History X, don't waste your time with this crap."

","Perhaps, had the movie drawn down to an epic or even slightly provocative conclusion, i could excuse kubrick's apparent fixation upon graphic violence against women. but the truth is, this movie says nothing of any value. what question does it ask, or attempt to answer? does the humanity and morals of man have to rest solely on his shoulders alone? anybody could ponder that question and come up with a slew of reasonable answers, surely more creative than this. what happens in this movie? a man does bad things that we get to witness in full colour, he goes to jail, he is shown violent films, and then spends the rest of the movie choking and gagging each time (and there are many!) he is provoked in anyway. i just have to ask - who cares? the story drags on only to return to the original standing point with no striking statements having been made. should i be happy that alex has wrestled himself free from the chains of suppression which bound him, and can now freely enjoy the thought and act of rape?
 the highlights: some of the art deco and certain characters.

","After seeing this generally disagreeable assault on the senses, I need a rest now, possibly even a rest home for a while.<br/><br/>I last saw this turkey when it was released in 1971, the year that I graduated from college. I couldn't appreciate it at the age of 22 and still don't like it at the ripe old age of 67. I decided to watch it again because I had just viewed Kubrick's outstanding ""Paths of Glory"", one of the best films that I have ever seen on the subject of war and the arrogant abuse of power, and I was very curious as to why IMDb subscribers rated this film a stunning 8.3, which is very rare for any movie and ranks it as one of the top 100 movies of all time. After my second viewing, I'm at an even bigger loss about this very high rating and ranking than I was 45 ago.<br/><br/>I believe that the often unbearable level of intense brutality in this movie is enough to provoke actual, real-life bloodshed in persons who are already inclined to be violent, specifically against women and defenseless elderly people. As my country, the USA, is currently experiencing a very dangerous epidemic of horrifying, violent incidents, including several recent mass murders, movies such as this, are not at all helpful to our present situation, which has become a national crisis. I can't see a single benefit of this violence to me as a viewer or to my society as a whole. That having been said, I still believe in the first amendment and in freedom of expression, but after seeing this relentless display of viciousness, most of which seems to be merely for its own sake or perhaps fulfills a desire to shock viewers and for no other purpose, I find myself struggling with my own deepest convictions.<br/><br/>I read several of the glowing reviews of this movie by others on IMDb. Many described this as a ""masterpiece"" and an ""extraordinary work of art"" without clearly explaining why and without the use of adequate, specific examples that support their high ratings and adoration.<br/><br/>Personally, I could not relate to the central character, to his vicious gang, or to any other of the movie's unlikable or weak personalities in any way. During the ""rehabilitation"" phase of the movie, I could not understand what society or government, today or in the future, would elect to employ the methods that were used. The future world that was created, consisting of ugly, vulgar works of art and interior designs, abandoned theaters, perverse behavior, uncontrollable sex drive, constant physical abuse, disorder, neglect, filth, and general disrespect for anything and everything, was just too creepy for me to want to experience for even one hour, let alone two hours and seventeen minutes. Another major offense was the inappropriate use of Beethoven's magnificent music as it accompanies the most unpleasant visual images conceivable. It's too bad that deceased artists have no say as to how their works are used after they are gone, but who ever said that life was fair? I gave this movie a rating of four out of ten only because it did manage to produce a response of utter revulsion from within me, but I can't think of any other accomplishment. Not my cup of tea."
"ArtisanArtist","Null","5","10","5 April 2006"," Horrible
","This is a short review - I think this film is horrible. Showing scenes of rape and violence, this film is a piece of trash. It glorifies what it presumes to decry. It does nothing to really help people - it just encourages the violence that is in the world today. Young kids watch this and feel their emerging sexism and hatred are well-justified. The rapist mentality is what feeds this films. It's hypocritical in the extreme, because of this. Kubrick should have had to do ten years parole at a rape shelter to see the devastation up close. Anyone who gets off on this movie should have to do the same. It's too bad that so many movies add to the hatred that exists in the world today - and it makes it even more heinous if they are done well - it's creativity in the service of something trashy and hateful."
"MrHappy-3","Null","5","10","1 January 1999"," One of the most over-rated films ever
","I really do not see the great appeal of the movie version of ""A Clockwork Orange"".  I have never read the book, but I bet many others have not either. It seems to me that a lot of people who urge other watchers of the film to ignore the violent parts and to concentrate on the storyline -- it seems that they themselves miss the point of the movie.  The book is apparently different, but the film makes no moral claims as to the character Alex, other than the weak assertion that he is evil.  As the last shot shows, Alex in the movie has not been changed by the therapy, nor by those who attempt revenge on him.  This doesn't seem too profound to me, and I am glad a much greater film, ""The French Connection"", which makes no attempts (and therefore doesn't fail in its attempt) at moralizing, beat out ""A Clockwork Orange"" for Best Picture.  Please, people -- if you're going to say stuff like, ""BEST FILM EVER. PERIOD,"" then at least pick a film that has a pulse. ""A Clockwork Orange"" utilizes those classic Kubrick-style wide-angle shots that are wonderful for the eye, but which also lack ""feeling"".  In other words, they worked very well in the sterile atmosphere of ""2001:A Space Odyssey"" but did not work so well in the human world of ""A Clockwork Orange"". Another thing:  what's up with that scene in which Alex and his Droogs are riding through the country in their car?  Those are some pretty cheesy effects -- the use of an obviously stationary car in front of a moving picture, to give the entirely unrealistic effect of a moving car.  And the drunkard in the second scene on the street:  could he be any more of a caricature, waving his bottle in his hand wildly, while slumped against pavement and singing an old diddy?  Sometime I will read the book, so Kubrick's sometimes amateurish adaptation will be cleansed from my memory."

"gmworker94","2","6","13","4 February 2010"," Good versus Evil
","I did a review on the movie A Clockwork Orange. The movie was made in 1971 by Stanley Kubrick. The plot of this movie is about the main character Alex who robs, rapes and pillages innocent people in Britain. After another night of debauchery he gets caught killing a woman after another violent encounter. Alex then goes to prison where he hears of an experimental program that would mean an early release from prison. Once he completes this treatment he is released only to be faced with his past transgressions.<br/><br/>The basic theme of this movie is good versus evil. Alex loves to inflict harm upon others at great personal satisfaction to him and his pals. After treatment which artificially changes his personality towards violence he becomes someone outside of himself. This program denied Alex of being human with his own nature and instead replaced by the Government's will for him to be non violent. This dehumanizing of Alex basically gives him a taste of how he did this to others and distances him from family and friends. <br/><br/>There is one film I could draw some similar comparisons to for theme. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest with Jack Nicholson could be used for that same type of theme. Mac who was Nicholson's character was an outgoing troublemaker who was in the institution trying to get out of hard time on the work farm for committing a crime. Mac sets up several uprisings against Nurse Ratched. One scene, Mac is taken and shock treatment was performed on him trying to change his attitude. This is consistent with the therapy Alex endured which would make him ill every time he saw violence.<br/><br/>One motif in this film was the music which played when he was committing his heinous crimes. Alex loved classical music mostly Beethoven and when that music would play was usually during his crime sprees. This music seemed to enhance his criminal acts bringing out his inner evil that flowed through his body. After the dehumanization of Alex the same music that fueled his crime frenzies now has a very negative effect on Alex making him want to kill himself when he heard some of the same music. The music was Beethoven symphony 9, part 4 which set him off.<br/><br/>The film is set to take place in futuristic Britain but the lighting and backgrounds make it seem far ago and not futuristic at all. The film uses various angles capturing thoughts and ideas of Alex when he fantasizes about violence and sex. Then when Alex takes his therapy these images of those very things he loves so dearly now make him ill. This is effective since you can listen to Alex narrate what is going on in his head and you can visually see what is taking place as he describes it. Through these images and Alex's actions as things play out demonstrate the how his demeanor changed. The different symbols such as the 4 Christ statue and the phallus symbolism ties in with the good versus evil theme this film portrayed."
"the81kid","3","7","16","26 April 2005"," I don't think this is a good film, but I fear I'm in the minority.
","I'm afraid I'm one of those few people who just doesn't 'get' this film. There are two things in this film I like: Malcolm McDowell, who is an excellent and really under-used actor, and the music. Apart from these two I found the film silly, unbelievable, and the main 'theme' (does forcing people to be good actually make them good?) lost to me. Of course, I fear I am in the minority here, but I don't base my opinions on what the majority thinks. I'm going to go out on a limb and say I think Stanley Kubrick was unique, but not a very good director. 2001, Barry Lyndon and Full Metal Jacket are very interesting and different, but not very good. He always appears a bit aloof and cold in directing, not letting the audience feel to strongly about the characters. Much like A Clockwork Orange.<br/><br/>Just thought I'd share my thoughts on this film. I know many will disagree with me, but A Clockwork Orange is too random and subjective a film for me to consider good film-making."

There is really no message in this movie. An invitation to think? May be, but do you really need an invitation for that?<br/><br/>The quality of the filmmaking itself is crappy, honestly. The acting is uneven and sometimes extremely unrealistic. Nothing special about camerawork, sets, sound or music (of course, it's Bethoveen, but they could have put any classic music there, so Kubrick doesn't get any credit). And the movie is tooooooooo sloooooooow for the modern tastes.<br/><br/>One thing was quite good - directing. Too bad that Kubrick's talent was wasted, because all the components were crap.<br/><br/>And everything is extremely silly, from the opening shots, to the use of Russian words without any apparent purpose, to the manners of the people, to overacting by practically everyone (I felt embarrassed for practically every character :])."

If he wants a cathartic experience to relieve the stress of the world he just beats someone up. He has no regard for how his actions impact others.

"Mezzotint91","Null","3","5","9 April 2002"," Possible Spoiler. Good can be as Pure as Evil
","Good is Evil<br/><br/>A Clockwork Orange represents good and evil differently than other films by connecting elements of evil and innocence in one character.<br/><br/>I could not help but respect the purity Kubrick gave the protagonist Alex DeLarge.  His color use, camera movements, and editing create a unique atmosphere where the audience hates the characters' actions, but respects his pure motivation.<br/><br/>Kubrick does this by using elements such as sound and color.  The background music throughout the film implies innocence making this Alex's `rite of passage' story.  Visually, Alex is presented as pure.  He is introduced in all white, drinking milk in a white milk bar, surrounded by maternity statues.  Kubrick incorporates a tracking shot slowly revealing Alex and his surroundings.<br/><br/>Ironically, milk blinds Alex during a night of `ultra-violence', allowing him to be captured.  This starts his transformation into adulthood.  He enters jail in a suit, appearing to be an adult.  Using unusual methods, Alex is `reformed' into a man who gets sick when he hears Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, sees violence, and feels sexual urges. These things representing his innocence.  Coincidentally, Alex always ended his gallivanting by listening to Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.<br/><br/>This song eventually drives Alex to attempt suicide.  I viewed this event as Alex's rebirth into another physical and psychological transition.  We symbolically see him completely abandon his childhood.<br/><br/>At last, Kubrick brings the audience into the hospital for the final scene. Alex emerges from his coma bandaged, once again in white, representing his restored innocence.  During the scene, he rejects his real mother and symbolically takes on a new one.  This mother ironically is Frederick, the same person who developed the treatment that reformed him.  Frederick is telling Alex he will take care of his needs, while feeding him.  Frederick feeding Alex parallels a mother breast feeding her child.  The film ends in Alex's fantasy; two naked girls wrestling and Alex proclaiming,` I was cured'.<br/><br/>The beautiful thing about this movie is Alex's strange connection to the average adolescent male.  He feels many of the same emotions such as sexual urges.  However, he is depicted to be the opposite of the average male. Kubricks choice in linking the aspect just verify's that good can be as pure as evil."

"yakikorosu","5","5","11","26 March 2002"," Intellectual... or just confusing?
","I often enjoy movies that comment on society and the nature of man, and I loved other Kubrick flicks like Full Metal Jacket and The Shining, with Dr. Strangelove being possibly my favorite movie of all time. I was anxious to see this one, having heard it praised as a true masterpiece, and I must admit I was quite disappointed.<br/><br/>*** SPOILERS AHEAD ****<br/><br/>A lot of people who praise this movie say that it raises the question of whether Alex is truly reformed after his treatment or not. Frankly, I don't see how that's a question at all... to me, he was obviously not the least bit reformed, and only restraining himself because of the ""punishment"" he would receive if he acted out.<br/><br/>Another point often brought up is the disturbing, shocking, nature of the film, and the effect is has on the viewer, but frankly, by today's (2002) standards, the violence is hardly anything special, and the sex only a bit less so. Silly, pointless movies like ""The Cell"" have disturbed me a lot more than this one.<br/><br/>Many particular elements of the movie didn't sit well with me. The ""sickness"" that violence or sex induces in Alex during the second half of the film is really quite silly, it mostly consists of him holding his head and burping repeatedly. Even Alex himself describes it as, to paraphrase, ""the feeling that something horrible is going to happen to me"". So... this punishment makes you paranoid? That's it? I imagine the scene where he's locked into a room and forced to listen to Beethoven (which induces the same sickness) was supposed to make you feel badly for him, but the ridiculous nature of this sickness made it more comical than anything to me. I kept wondering why he doesn't just stuff something in his ears, or break the door down (it looks like a very flimsy door). I realize that you can similarly question any movie, but I wouldn't have noticed these things if I hadn't been, by that point, pretty bored.<br/><br/>Some elements of the movie particularly baffled me. There are many things that flat out SCREAM ""Look, I'm symbolic for something!"", but for the life of me I can't figure out what. Why does Alex's mother (and later the psychiatrist) have purple hair? Why does the same elderly mother wear outfits of red leather and thigh high boots? Why does the gang that Alex's group fight in the beginning wear Army uniforms? Why is there such a strong homosexual innuendo (Alex's teacher grabbing his crotch early on, the chaplain making a pass at him, the old man at the end living alone with a young man, etc) throughout the film?<br/><br/>One thing that confused me in particular, and this is an element most viewers will miss, is that the movie often uses Russian words. I notice only because I know Russian, as the words are easy to figure out through context. Alex and his friends go to a ""Moloko"" (Russian for 'milk') bar. Alex repeatedly uses ""Malchik"" (Russian for 'boy') to describe young men. Same with ""Devochka"" (Russian for 'girl') to describe the women. Near the end, Alex talks about eating ""Lomtiks"" (Russian for 'slice' or 'piece', usually in reference to food) of bread. As this movie is made during the height of the Cold War, is this some sort of attempt to associate Alex's mindless sex and violence with Russian culture?<br/><br/>I can see no real message to this movie, besides that the treatment that Alex was given obviously doesn't work. But I fail to see any sort of point to that message, as this treatment obviously doesn't exist. If the message is against psychiatric rehabilitation in general, as opposed to incarceration, I don't think it makes the point very well, considering that the few years Alex spends in prison don't even seem all that bad, and certainly don't change him. He says that he endures horrible beatings from the guards, all we ever see him do in prison is sit around, fantasize about sex/violence and quote the bible to please the chaplain. If the film was supposed to comment on how ineffective rehabilitation in general is, I don't see why there's an attempt in the second half of the movie to make Alex a sort-of sympathetic character. Shouldn't it show him as the monster he still is?<br/><br/>I talked about this movie with a friend earlier, and he pointed out to me that at the time this film was released, the violence and sex was probably most shocking, and that there was a heavy movement towards psychiatric rehabilitation of prisoners at the time. If that's true, then this is simply a reactionary period piece, dealing with one very particular issue.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, this is by no means a very bad movie. But I can't really say it's a very good movie either, and certainly doesn't compare with other Kubrick films that I've seen. This is by no means a classic, as it fails on the one crucial test: it does NOT, at least for me, stand the test of time. I give this movie a 7/10 for the first half of the film (up to the part where Alex goes to prison), which is surreal and often darkly hilarious, and 3/10 for the rest of it, which I found boring, lacking in coherence, and, frankly, often quite silly and overdone. That averages out to 5, which is, I think, the right score for this movie.<br/><br/>NOTE: I have NOT read the book, but if I can't understand this movie without reading the book first, it is, IMO, simply another flaw of the film."

","This movie is about watching other movies, and how those movies influence us. Kubrick was never about the writing. He was all about the photography and what's on the screen being presented to you. So consider what is being presented to us:<br/><br/>Our on screen surrogates, the droogs, are in costume, constantly performing for each other, with theatrical speech and slang.<br/><br/>The rumble with their rivals is on a stage.<br/><br/>The rape scene is acted out as another film (they even sing the song for you)<br/><br/>There is a non stop focus on the eye - this is meant to be your eye.<br/><br/>Here's where it got interesting and meta, and it was already in the book too: the accosted writer is (self-referentially) the writer of the film, who incidentally drives the character to suicide by exposing him to a performance.<br/><br/>This is all meant to hit you over the head during the therapy scenes. Alex is forced to watch movies, just as we are forced to watch him watch.<br/><br/>Kubrick knows how to handle abstraction. When there is a film in a film, the degree of abstraction has to be the same inside the film, as the film we are watching has with real life."

"imbluzclooby","7","2","3","16 June 2016"," The work of an Evil Genius
","If you watch this to gain extra depth from your discerning mind and senses, the more disturbing it becomes. Even though the violence is stylized, comical, choreographed and phony, the movie's theme is more repugnant than most Avant Gaurde and Noir film makers could even fathom making. This film, although groundbreaking in its shameless and willful ambition, has some flaws. The flaws are artistic choices that are meant to convey an idea while a few other flaws are just poor craftsmanship. The acting is quite uneven in some areas. The set designs, background settings along with inappropriate wide angle camera shots, for me, detract from the personal focal points required for me to get personally involved and connected. Most everything in Clockwork Orange looks too post 60's modern from the home decors, artwork, and some other set designs. It is highly unlikely that middle aged people will sport funky futuristic furniture and art in their home, especially in England. What's more off-putting was some of the dialogue and kitschy usage of British youth slang. And I think this turned off many viewers as well. I am convinced that Stanley Kubrick was a genuinely evil man. Whether or not one agrees with this charge is not important to me, but after I begin to make a compelling argument against this film from a moral standpoint, you may consider it. To begin, our protagonist and (Humble Narrator)is a sadistic villain, who, without any rationale or excuse, commits heinous crimes without giving any personal reasons for doing so. As we follow Alex and his gang of Droogs on this voyeuristic rampage we witness their assaults on innocent victims, both young and old. There aren't any social or anarchist purposes for doing so. They do it just for kicks. This fuels their rebellious spirit, and somehow we are supposed to admire them.<br/><br/>As our Humble Alex gets arrested and sent to prison, we witness the process of rehabilitation through punishment and 'Aversion Therapy'. Once Alex pays the price and does his time he is chosen to be a guinea pig for a new experiment by a renowned psychiatrist. Alex goes through the grueling process through being administered of drugs and subjected to watching non-stop screen violence. Alex is cured, or reformed rather. He is sent out into the real world again for a second chance.<br/><br/>This is the fatal moralistic flaw of the film and why I think the message is seriously wrong. While Alex is being confronted with hostility he gets ill and queasy when trying to fight off his temptations for revenge and self-defense. This is not necessarily the benefit he needs, but rather the benefit to society for those that had the misfortune of being in his presence. What we see is that Alex has not fundamentally changed in his character. He is still the dastardly menace he always was inside. The difference is that he has been conditioned to feel physically bad when giving into temptation. I'm not sure if this Scientific medical programming of the mind works as it is shown here, but if it is then we are faced with another controversial topic. The story reveals that as we are supposed to be appalled by violence and brutality it is even worse to nip the problem in the bud by sacrificing a sick person's natural instincts. This is a bad message. It is also an anti-establishment message. This movie has been lauded by many art house and cinema majors. I believe that these people imbue too much profundity and meaning into a film than doesn't exactly deserve much notoriety. Sure, Kubrick was a die-hard perfectionist who was dedicated to his craft. He was a true artist. And that is why I give this film 7 out of 10 stars. The effort, dedication, meticulous camera work and effective angles make for an effective movie. But it is what I call a really well made 'bad movie'."
"jamesshortybig","9","2","3","26 November 2015"," A Fantastic Film
","There are so many positives, I'll just look at a few here. Firstly, the director. This film is directed by Stanley Kubrick, who made a lot of horror films like The Shining or 2001: A Space Odyssey, and he is a very good director, the shots he used are amazing! he uses a hand-held camera for most of his shots and even threw his out a window at one time, to imitate someone falling. Malcolm McDowell gave a convincing performance as Alex, mixing class and sophistication with savage and beast like, as his characters 'interests are rape, Ultra-Violence and Beethoven.' Also, there were some lines in the film that meant to sound serious but were funny and there were some lines that were just funny for the heck and I loved that tone.<br/><br/>Now on to the negatives, and I would like to say this film isn't for everyone, there was loads of graphic content in this film like violence, sexual content, nudity and even a Rape Scene! While those scenes aren't that bearable to watch in 2015, this was released in the 70's and opinion has quite changed since then. Also, if you guys haven't read the novel to this film, then you won't have a clue what they're saying. This film takes so much from the novel, including it's vocabulary, which is more impossible to pronounce than Cockney Rhyming Slang. And, also some characters are really bland, but that's understandable because it mainly focuses on Alex. and some of the actors put all their effort into this film. eg. Michael Bates as Chief Officer Barnes who puts 100% into such a small role.<br/><br/>On the whole, its a fantastic film, and it deserves a place in film history, even for the wrong reasons. Before I get to the score, I will say that if you do get a chance to see this film, like Shia LeBouf would say, DO IT!!! However if you feel uneasy with all the Violence and sexual content in this film, I don't blame you because its not the best thing to see, but I didn't mind. (It's not nice to watch, but it's also not that unbearable that I turned off my TV.)"
"CinemaClown","Null","2","3","28 September 2015"," A Vicious Socio-Political Satire That's Witty & Disturbing In Equal Doses!
","One of the most controversial, violent & disturbing films ever made, A Clockwork Orange is a meticulously crafted, ingeniously narrated & brilliantly performed cinema from Stanley Kubrick that presents the demanding perfectionist in sublime form as he blends violence, erotica, humour & classical compositions into one tightly structured & highly gripping sci-fi comedy to offer his biting take on morality, psychology & the importance of free will.<br/><br/>Based on the novel of the same name, the story of A Clockwork Orange is set in the future Britain and follows Alex DeLarge; a delinquent youngster who leads a small gang of thugs, and covers his crime spree with his droogs, his subsequent capture by the police & his time in prison where he learns of an experimental aversion therapy which, if he manages to pass, will get him back on the streets but not everything during his rehabilitation goes the way he expected.<br/><br/>Written, produced & directed by Stanley Kubrick, A Clockwork Orange makes its intentions very clear within its opening moments that it isn't going to be an easy sit for its audience as just one evening of 'ultra-violence' perpetrated by Alex & his droogs is enough to scar many but this sadistic nature of the depicted violence exists for a reason and plays a vital role in the story's outcome for Kubrick here aims to critique the bigger problem than the evilness of an individual.<br/><br/>Just like any other Kubrick film, A Clockwork Orange is a work of painstaking craftsmanship that presents the filmmaker in complete control of his craft. Although his vision of the future Britain may not be entirely convincing but some of its elements are much in tune with where the current society seems to be heading. Production design team come up with set pieces that brim with sexual undertones while the excessive use of white colour is one of Kubrick's own trademarks.<br/><br/>Cinematography is inventive, influential & effectively carried out for the camera makes very efficient use of its bright colour palette, lighting, shadows, fluid movements & close-ups to capture the unfolding drama and encapsulates the whole picture with an otherworldly feel. Despite clocking in at 136 minutes, its pacing is never an issue. Plus, the seamless manner in which the already existing classical compositions are fused with its disturbing images is certainly amongst the film's most spectacular aspects.<br/><br/>Coming to the acting department, A Clockwork Orange is pretty much a one-man show as Malcolm McDowell steals every moment with a charismatic but equally maniacal rendition of his character and his screen presence is so magnetic that it makes Alex DeLarge one of the most fascinating antiheroes to surface in cinema history. Although the performances by everyone, including McDowell may seem overly theatrical, it eventually works out in favour of the picture for it adds a sardonic element in an already bizarre narrative.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, A Clockwork Orange has aged tremendously well over the years and only gets more rewarding on every subsequent viewing. Frightening & witty in equal doses, controversial on the grounds of its violent imagery yet an eye-opener when it comes to the subject of morality, this socio-political satire remains as relevant today as it was during its time of release and its critical take on mental conditioning that aims to control an individual by removing his or her ability to choose transcends the realms of psychology itself. Highly recommended. Multiple viewings advised."

","From the first frame till the last one, 'A Clockwork Orange' is intriguing, thought-provoking, meticulous and brilliant, like most other Kubrick films. The screenplay, cinematography (colourful & exquisitely photographed), set-design (very modern for its time), acting, background score - every aspect is almost flawless.<br/><br/>The story is a dark satire on a futuristic world, where they try to eradicate violence by conditioning criminals to abhor violence and sex by watching gory movies. Their (criminals') morals remain the same, but they just can't indulge in violence anymore; they become defenseless. The movie gives rise to so many topics of discussion, and you can debate all day long on the different themes it explores. Ultimately, the primary theme - if a human is stripped of his own choice of good and evil, he simply becomes mechanical, like 'clockwork'.<br/><br/>Alex DeLarge, the ""humble narrator"", the anti- hero, is one of the most important and fascinating characters in English Cinema. <br/><br/>The story, and its adaptation, is much ahead of its time. The liberties Kubrick takes in the field of violence and sex (in 1971) are quite commendable. No wonder it caused such a stir during the time of its release. Even after so many years, the movie can be enjoyed completely - it speaks so much about violence, youth agitation, gangs, criminal reforms, politics, etc., which are relevant even today.<br/><br/>Final Word - 'A Clockwork Orange' remains indelibly remarkable even till this date."
"Kaliyugaforkix","Null","2","3","9 September 2012"," Eyes Wide Shut
","So much has already been written about this viddy, dissected & commemorated & pilloried like maybe no other member of the Pantheon Of Kubrick that any more hoopla is redundant. There's really not much else left to say when it comes to some things, especially controversial classics like this- you're just adding to the growing pile of he said/she said yay or nay. That's why I focus so much on no-name trash.<br/><br/>As a teenager watching this, I was probably the kind of spectacle addicted junkie Kubrick was thumbing his nose at, waiting eagerly for the infamous scenes of sex & violence while not really paying attention to the rest. My grandparents unknowingly strolled into a showing during its original 70's run and walked out mid way through, disgusted. I didn't really get it back then in all but the most obvious of ways; all that stuck with me about this gorgeous shot of ice water was the colourful clutter, the day-glow X rated minutiae stuffing the sidelines while gleefully insane cartoon characters strut back n forth in paroxysms of sound & fury, totally oblivious to their outlandish surroundings. <br/><br/>Its been said that there's really no other opening like A CLOCKWORK ORANGE's, that slooooow pull back on statue over statue of luridly posed pretty polly with a trademark Kubrickian glower at the dead centre courtesy of Mcdowell- its very memorable. Than there's the chorus line of Christs, back slapping plastic Jesus' shot like song and dance men in Alex's room that recalls a scene from Jodo's HOLY MOUNTAIN where the Thief screams in despair as the camera zooms out on a warehouse of copyright Christs piled together in towering mountain-caps of commodification. Later on still we get the cat lady, surrounded by pornographic paintings & pussies, ordering our lead droog to be CAREFUL with her gigantic sculpted penis: 'Its a very important work of art!'.<br/><br/>Again and again acts of ultra-violence and in & out enacted unblinkingly before a panoply of warped popular culture, neon frescoes of trash art kitsch littering the frames like the rubble of some unseen psychic meltdown. This viddy nailed with frightening accuracy the gleaming post modern sheen of our full blown covert dystopia, the apocalyptic landscape of modern life where pod people move through an over mediated social arena, oppressed at every turn by over sexed infotainment and various other subliminal mind f%&ks while all the time insisting it has absolutely nooo baring on their own behavior. Clockwork orange indeed. What if the world ended and no one noticed?<br/><br/>Its like the characters in the film exist in some hellish time warp, all sorts of incongruous fashions and designs crammed into an unwieldy hodgepodge of cultural schizophrenia. It looks at once painfully retro and smoothly futuristic. Even the nadsat dialogue is a melting pot of alien patois, slang and contemporary words jumbled together into a kind of demonic poetry. Truly I've seen no other movie prophesize the multicultural, Orwellian sh*thole England was to become like A CLOCKWORK ORANGE. <br/><br/>No wonder this flick figures into several mind control conspiracy theories, that it even provoked copycat crimes. I wonder how Kubrick felt about hitting the nail on the head so completely that his work about brainwashing and hyper-reality seemingly turned out its own earnest droogies, unable to differentiate between fantasy and reality. The biggest irony though is that even before the Ludvico treatment, Alex Delarge was a nothing but a clockwork orange."
"ackstasis","9","2","3","24 November 2009"," ""What's it going to be, eh?""
","In Kubrick's adaptation of Anthony Burgess' bizarre 1959 dystopian novel, a juvenile delinquent (Malcolm McDowell) and his gang of droogs whittle away their time partaking in such wholesome activities as beating homeless drunks, warring with rival gangs, raping helpless women, and enjoying the music of Ludwig Van Beethoven. There are two things happening in this film: one that Kubrick inherited from Burgess' writing, and another that is endemic to the cinematic medium.<br/><br/>The first role of 'A Clockwork Orange (1971)' is as a rather vicious political satire, dryly mocking the hypocrisy of the government and its policies on institutionalisation and criminal rehabilitation. In the film, the Minister of the Interior (Anthony Sharp) is depicted as opportunistic and self-serving, latching onto the unproven Ludovico technique in a bid to stem his party's failing popularity with voters. When public opinion turns against the therapy, the Minister very swiftly back-peddles, reversing the treatment so that Alex may return to his former ultra-violent ways: ""I was cured alright!""<br/><br/>The UK edition of Burgess' novel contained a final chapter in which Alex sees the error of his former ways, and vows to reform into a productive member of society. Kubrick was unaware of this addition until he had almost completed the screenplay, and never considered using it in the film. This was, I think, a good decision. Burgess' ending shies away from the problem: by letting human nature run its course, he seems to be implying that the problem of juvenile delinquency will sort itself out. Kubrick, admittedly, doesn't offer any solutions of his own, but the corrupt manner in which he ends the film leaves a sour taste.<br/><br/>The Ludovico technique involves the screening of movies, which also allows Kubrick room for a degree of self-referentiality. It is in the audiences' nature to recoil from acts of sex and violence, and Kubrick's hard-nosed, deliberately-subversive approach (utilising the perspective of its biased protagonist and narrator) only encourages this response. Just as Alex is exposed to the Ludovico aversion therapy, Kubrick is exposing his audience to the same treatment. Does it work? Do we become desensitised to the violence, or do we begin to associate socially- accepted cues (i.e. Beethoven's Ninth, ""Singing in the Rain"") with acts of evil?"
"mexd7","Null","2","3","24 January 2006"," what a disappointment....
","I just saw this film for the first time about an hour ago, and I really didn't think Alex was cool. In fact not at all. He seemed intelligent but like most psychopath's that really doesn't say much. I really dug the soundtrack and the point Kubrick was making on violence. I also thought it had to do with the media and how his parents just believed more in the papers than in their own son. It struck a chord with a lot of social issues that are still problems to this day, but it could have been shorter and have illustrated the same points. I also found some scenes to be really bland, almost like eyes wide shut. As usual it seems like people hyped up this movie to be the end all be all of all films when in reality I'd give it a 6 out of 10. six because it really left this impact with me, you can just tell the picture had this magnitude of power behind it (some scenes are really jarring)....but with richer dialogue and a shorter storyline, I would've been more satisified."

"mentalcritic","Null","2","3","16 September 2001"," Kubrick's best film
","I guess I am what you would call a complete non-fan of Stanley Kubrick, although I would never call him a pervert (displaying sex in your films hardly makes you this) or proclaim thankfulness at his passing away. I do, however, find that it is hard to enjoy all but two of his films: Dr. Strangelove and this one.<br/><br/>The reason why A Clockwork Orange is Kubrick's best effort is because it is his most faithful adaptation. Just about every Kubrick film was based on literature of some sort, and he almost always messed up translating it to screen. You can see this in Full Metal Jacket, where he leaves out more than half of The Short Timers in spite of its very short length. A Clockwork Orange also sees Kubrick leaving out details of his source material, but in all but one case, these weren't important. I'll deal with the one that is.<br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick's conception of the ending was based upon the American version of the novel, which simply ends with Alex having the effects of the Ludovico technique reversed. While this is a neat ending that allows one to speculate about his next step in life, it cuts out the very heart of Anthony Burgess' story, one that is especially relevant in this day and age where child psychologists are shoving Ritalin down children's necks like mobsters electrocuting dogs so they'll be hungrier to tear into one another. That point, in a nutshell, is that being bad by choice is far preferable to being good because you have no other option. When Alex is suffering the vengeance of the so-called good folk, you just wish he could get up and start smacking the crap out of them again. In the chapter of the novel when he gets that back, seeing him make the choice to live a normal, peaceful existence anyway is a great triumph of the will over mind control. Not including that in the film was a big mistake, and it is a matter of record that Burgess was more than a little upset with the US publisher as a result.<br/><br/>The reason why Kubrick's film is preferable to the novel, however, is that the novel often borders on being incomprehensible. Rather than asking you to read and try to decipher a very unstructured slang, the film just shows you what Alex is talking about, giving it to you in clear red, green, and blue. The novel is very rewarding if you get through it, but it smacks of having been written as a political statement and takes a lot of effort, which gets in the way of the horror factor. Sometimes, being able to sit back and watch is a big advantage.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, Kubrick's film has earned him my respect as a filmmaker. He did this his way, he tried to make art in his pictures, and he even managed to succeed at points like this. Which is more than I can say for the Wachowskis and Tarantinos of this world."
"BlackBalloon","Null","2","3","1 September 2001"," Entertaining and well-made, but overrated
","A Clockwork Orange is a movie with a cult following, Kubrick is a director with a cult following.  I think its reputation is a bit over-hyped, personally.  It seems to me there are opportunities where we could have been allowed to feel empathy with Alex, but instead Kubrick just gives us the thug's joke-y, flat inner monologue or funny melodrama.  It's a shame, because I think Kubrick would have dug that.  Kubrick is not all chill. There are moments of real emotion in his movies, but when Alex is scared or sad or angry, it all seems like a joke.  Even if this was intentional, it could have been a better movie."
"Trafford","10","2","3","5 August 1998"," my all-time favourite film
","I absolutely loved this film. Kubrick's use of colour impressed me the most, and his innovation used in the slow-mo and 'fast-mo' scenes. the acting is superb and the conversion from book to screenplay is quite loyal while being drastic in parts with the changes. also the music accomponying all the scenes works beautifully. what can i say? it is my all-time favourite film."
"zhr1","10","2","3","15 April 2000"," Violence made to seem beautiful- a reflection of human nature?
","Violence made to seem beautiful- a concept that repulses many, and rightfully so. However violence is deeply embedded in human psychology and in society. Clockwork Orange uses a stunning sound-track and stylized English argot as a backdrop to choreographed extreme violence to bring across this point. The association of Beethoven's Ninth and Nazi horrors exemplifies how thin the veneer of civilization really is. Can the sociopathic human really be change, and if yes into what, is a second aspect that the picture explores. Beyond the major sociological point raised by the film, it is a masterpiece of atmosphere and setting, exemplifying the strength of cinema as the major art form of our time. One of the all-time great movies."
"cbfx","1","8","21","2 December 2015"," Why is it hard to watch?
","I find it difficult to believe that viewers find CWO ""great"" - from a cinematic point of view, it is pure trash. Cheap lighting, lousy rear projection, simple camera moves (mostly zooms), use of classical music that just bleeds from one scene to the next.<br/><br/>Before I go on, I saw this in first run in Chicago in 1971. I loved 2001 and Dr S. wanted more of the brilliance that those films offered. My reaction then is just as it was in my recent reviewing: He was making a cheap film that would bring in giant box office revenues. He seemed to be obsessed with titillating himself as well as the viewer with exposing naked breasts at every opportunity. Using step-printing or under winding to show the bed hopping antics in the orgy scene was childish. Even the ""moral"" of the film is too simplistic to rate honor.<br/><br/>As much as I was disappointed in Kubrick, I am saddened that reviewers didn't find some of the same faults with CWO that I have.<br/><br/>Other than shocking us and providing a view of perverse society of the opulence of the rich, the mindlessness of government, and the demented individuals who create horror in the name of entertainment, I find CWO to be painful to watch because of it's lack of cinema skill as much as it's poor statements on the problems of humanity."
"grayyoung","10","1","1","6 May 2020"," The scariest film i've seen and it happens to not even be a horror
","A Clockwork Orange is brilliant, let me start there, it pulls no punches and ever scene you're shocked at what is shown to you. The poppy asthetics serve as a strong contrast to the disturbing events and crimes commited by Alex. Lets talk about Alex because he is an absolutely brilliant character. They put Alex through so much yet we never feel for him because due to those brilliant first scenes we are unable to relate to Alex despite his treatment. The treatment in this film oses a question, was Alex truly cured or is he just unable to ACT on his violent urges. We see that Alex attempts to punch or strike some people but simply cannot. Is Alex changed? No, in the end the character of Alex is pure evil and chaos, he deserved everything he got but he never gets his ultimate punishment. Alex is a brilliant character in the way that Alex himself never changes, we only are given the illusion of him changing and told that it is him healing. The dialouge is creepy, brilliant and poetic making the movie feel like more of a play then a movie. I reccomend that you watch the full X rated version as it still shows little outright and the R rated version looses some of the shock factor which doesn't put you into the fear of the moment as much. Eitherway, A Clockwork Orange is a brilliant work of art and I can't reccomend it enough."

Also, there are two versions of the book. The British and the American. As I remember, the American version has a prettified ending, or something akin to that.<br/><br/>As far as the movie is concerned, in many ways, ACO hasn't aged well. It looks like a 1971 universe masquerading as 2017. Yet there are elements that are surreal that they translate effortlessly to any time.<br/><br/>I remember watching it for the first time at The Magic Lantern in Spokane. I felt icky and exhilarated afterward. I saw it again in a film class at Spokane Falls Community College. A third time in the early 80s.<br/><br/>The last time was within the last ten years. I turned off the DVD player and thought, this is how I felt when I saw Pulp Fiction--amazed at the technical expertise and disgusted by the crimson pornography Pauline Kael wrote about in the New Yorker and mentioned in the Atlantic piece by Adam Chandler.<br/><br/>With all that said, my takeaway from ACO is never really liking Singin' in the Rain anymore. Also, Malcolm MacDowell was so effortlessly perfect as Alex, that when I watched him play a Scientology-style leader in The Mentalist, I started humming the show tune.<br/><br/>My wife gave me a look."

","It's not hard to see why this film was so controversial. The realism and good performances bring so many horrors to life. The messages, symbolism and truths that come about are brutal and savage. Stanley Kubrick has put his stamp on this film with great cinematography, techniques and use of music. This is not an easy film to watch but yet its got artistic merit. It is gracefully directed and presented to us so that even if we are repulsed we cannot stop watching. It is definitely not black and white and one can't help but question what is the solution to juvenile delinquents? Who says what rehab should be?<br/><br/>I prefer more wholesome or less gruesome films that are thought provoking versus something of this flavour. Yet I do appreciate its direction and the experience it can deliver. When was the last time a film was brought to life that they feel like actual events?

"elgabote","6","1","1","8 June 2019"," Lacks dept on the main character and realism on choreographs
","I watched this movie the first time years ago, before having read the book, and I thought it was good.
Now, years after, I had forgot quite a lot about the movie and I read the book without the influence of the movie.
Now I've seen the movie again, and I can see how much is lacking. Is not a bad movie, Kubrick's cinematography is always interesting, and the movie actually has every part or scene from the book, so is not a totally bad adaptation, and the story is told whole and quite faithfully.
Still I felt like it lacks emphasis in very important aspects of the original story, which shows how violent and hateful is Alex and really hardcore violence though the whole story, but not gratuitous, violence is as important as any other character in this case.
This movie is from 1971, so I totally understand the violence being a bit lowered, still, the choreographs look quite silly and fake, and in my opinion makes the hole thing look more ridiculous than shocking. Using better angles and lighting could have help achieving better and more realistic results on this matter.
Then, the initial part where Alex hangs out with his gang and we see how vicious, skilled in violence and smart he is, and how dominant he is with them and also with his family is totally lost in the movie, which makes the character's dept and the whole sense of conflict on the audience on if the ""treatment"" he receives is absolutely unnecessary. Here he's almost a nice guy.
Also I felt it was overacted a lot of times, acting wasn't great in my opinion.
Then, and this is totally my taste, the psychedelic atmosphere Kubrick's version has is not completely to my liking or how I imagined it while reading, but still a fair point to experiment by the director and it's undoubtedly interesting.
Good movie over all but in the end, it falls short in depth of the characters (the main mostly) and a bit overacted, but the story is there and it has a visual twist from the director to make it feel fresh."
"toffeello","10","1","1","6 June 2019"," Joy of irony
","It's a story of many things, maybe that's why some people cannot catch up with them all.
I just love that everything in the story has more than one side. Even Nadsat (the language the teens speak) is both dark and funny at the same time. Alex is like that too, he's sinister and wild and simultaneously charming and funny-looking. He's nasty but glee. He's senselessly violent but he loves to listen to Beethoven. He's terrifying but pathetic. It just breaks all the taboos.
But apart from all of that, the story itself is just something else. It's a perfect unique dystopia portrayed in such an unusual atmosphere. It raises a lot of ethical questions while doing that as well. Like good/evil or suppression/free will. It dazzles your mind with being so close to the reality.
At the end, after conditioning Alex, he shows impulses to hate, violence, lust and all the things that are called ""evil"". He becomes a so called decent person but without a soul. As he says himself at the end, he was cured all right. So what's the aim? It's a purely ironic redemption that the treatment was to return him to his previous ""free"" state. But not many people notice the fact that previous Alex was also a product of conditioning as well.
And above all, something that creeps people out more than Alex is that any current government is sick enough to try these cures. So, in Alex's own words: ""The colors of the real world only become real when you viddy them in a film."""
"filmesfodasticos_by_jorgemarin","10","1","1","20 March 2019"," Perpretator and prey
","If not mentioned its release year, 1971, Clockwork Orange could be mistaken for a modern documentary on gangs. The subject here is not the violence itself, which caused the ban on the movie in several countries, but it is about politics, which appears all the time in the plot as a mechanism (clockwork?) for the maintenance of the status quo.<br/><br/>Thus, protagonist Alex DeLarge leads his group of droogies (""friends"" in the dialect Nadsat in which the film is narrated, and also in the book by Anthony Burgess), organizing the inherent activities of the youths of that dystopian society: beating beggars, rapes, robberies and depredations in general.<br/><br/>Alex's post-correctional counselor, the bizarre Fr. R. Deltoid, just waits for the time when his ward to commit some crime to hand him over to (equally violent) police. The opportunity does not delay, as the boy ends up killing a cheeky cat breeder and is sentenced to 14 years in prison.<br/><br/>Already in prison, and now a devoted chaplain's associate, Alex volunteers for a government-sponsored behavior change experiment. Called Ludovico's treatment, the experience consisted of implanting an aversive response to visual stimuli of violent scenes. By accident, the soundtrack to a film about Nazi atrocities is Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, Alex's most beloved song that will thereafter be equally painful for the ""regenerate"" prisoner.<br/><br/>No longer the perpetrator, Alex becomes a victim. Not only of the state but also of all its ancient objects of torment. One of its victims, a leader of the opposition to the government, puts the protagonist in a limit situation, so that, when seeking to kill himself, he invalidates the official chemical treatment.<br/><br/>By force of destiny, Alex leaves alive, although with many fractures, of the opposition attempt. Realizing his importance as a media pawn in the power game, Alex finally discovers the place where he can exercise his psychopathy in an institutionalized and liberating way: politics."

One day though, his Droogs betray him and he gets caught by the police.<br/><br/>He gets sent to prison but is later let out so he could be sent off to an experiment lab where he is given a treatment called The Ludovico Technique, where he is strapped to chair, has his eyes forced open and is made to watch videos of Ultra-Violence and Rape.

He is kicked out of his home and gets attacked by a bunch of homeless men, he then bumps into George and Dim who are now police officers and they attack him also.<br/><br/>So Alex's only place left to go is the house that he broke into, where he severely beat up a man and he rapes the man's wife. Apparently, the rape was so horrible that not only did it kill his wife, but it left him crippled and traumatised.<br/><br/>A Clockwork Orange is definitely one of those movies that you should probably watch only once, because you'll see it and you'll probably only want to see it once.

","Undoubtedly one of the best movies of all time. Another one of Kubrick's works of modern cinema art. This is the type of movie that makes more and more sense given the number of times you watch it. Everything about this movie is almost indefectible. The plot, acting, direction and the cinematography. Just perfect.<br/><br/>Yes, this movie is very well known for it's horrifying violence and sexual depictions but the deep meaning behind all that is plain cold and dull for one to just simply accept. Alex, the main protagonist. The one character even us the audience have a hard time choosing what to feel about. In a futuristic society where everything's ruled and corrupted by violence and sex, Even though being a criminal, Alex is in a sense just someone who's trying to get along and just survive. However all his actions led himself to a point where the state itself had to brainwash him. Which ultimately made him nothing but an emotionless body of flesh and blood. Even after 47 years this movie being released, this still very well depicts the situation of our current society. A shame indeed. Where it is also a corrupted and 
perverted system where the core values which drives us are nothing but, money, pleasure and power. That in any case we messed up, we will never be really ""forgiven"" for whatever it is that we've done. We'll just be a boulder rolling down a steep hill doing nothing but falling down. Our path, actions and motives. Everything will be then controlled by the ""people upstairs"". Just like the ending of the movie. Alex is alive and well but everything he's doing then are really just orders from the authorities. He is flesh and blood on the outside but merely mechanical on the inside. He is ""a clockwork orange""."

However, I suspect if one lives in an inner city or ghetto area of many large cities one may be able to relate more to the chain of events. <br/><br/>The film is a tad predictable, hence no higher than seven stars from me.

"ericstevenson","10","1","1","4 January 2018"," Great movie
","""A Clockwork Orange"" tells the story of a criminal named Alex and is composed of three parts. The first part features him and his followers committing crimes while the second features him being forced to be good and the third features him trying to adapt back in the real world. There are so many things that make this a wonderful film. The first that comes to mind is the music. No, not the Beethoven music played (although that's great too) but the music played in the more intense scenes. This is a great movie, but it is rather obscene.<br/><br/>It can be hard to understand the message of the story, but it is truly a powerful one. Alex is depicted as a sadist who is tortured to become an ordinary person. The film's main moral is that no matter how evil someone is, they shouldn't be forced to be rehabilitated. Alex even comes off as quite sympathetic in this movie. I guess most of the characters in this film are evil to a certain extent. I feel bad for Alex as he meets more conflict trying to readjust to society.<br/><br/>What's also so great is the imagery, especially at the beginning. I love seeing all these strange statues that set the mood for the rest of the film. I am so glad to finally see such a high rated movie on this website. The scene where Alex's eyes are forced open is among the most powerful and disturbing scenes in cinema history. The pacing with the three parts is fantastic and in a long film, that's always a big plus. It's great to see a film that has been homage so many times. The title refers to how an orange (something colorful) is worthless if it's done by clockwork (being forced to) just like a man in this scenario. ****"
"jrdnlwn","10","1","1","23 December 2017"," A brilliant work of art from the greatest filmmaker of all time
","There is no doubt that Stanley Kubrick was extraordinarily intelligent, and he is definitely my number one favorite filmmaker of all time. I love every one of his professional films, from The Killing (1956) to Eyes Wide Shut (1999). Each film of his clearly shows his expertise on a technical level, which for him began with still photography. The many topical issues, which are apparent in many of his films, have also been heavily discussed. His films, 2001: A Space Odyssey for example, have all received heavy criticism upon initial release. But no other film of Kubrick's has been as controversial as A Clockwork Orange. When I first saw A Clockwork Orange, I was a sophomore in high school. And, as you might expect, I was disgusted by what I had perceived as the cold, warped, and biased nature of the film, but I later realized how wrong I was. Just like many other viewers of the film, I was particularly negatively affected by the rape scene that occurs within the first ten to fifteen minutes of the film. However, after several more viewings of the film, and after thoroughly reading (and listening to) some rare interviews of Stanley Kubrick (I understand how much Kubrick disliked interviews), I began to understand not only his intentions, which were clearly misunderstood by many haters of the film, but also the brilliance and central idea of the film. Just like with any other Kubrick film, there is a lot to be said about A Clockwork Orange regarding the technical aspect and style of it, as well as the substance, intelligence, and brilliance that all lie beneath the surface of it. I advise you to BE CAREFUL before reading my review, because there are SPOILERS.<br/><br/>First of all, I have to FIRST mention the incredible cinematography that the film involves. As a filmmaker currently in college, I have in particular been heavily influenced by the use of the ultra wide-angle (or maybe fisheye) lens, tracking, and zoom shots used in the film. Although I find it very difficult to explain why I love these shots so much, they bring much of an effect to the screen. In addition, I love the shot of Alex's POV as he jumps out the window toward the end of the film; I find it amusing that the camera survived six takes of being dropped for that particular shot. I also love the use of slow and fast motion in the film, which adds to the satire of the film. What amazes me about Kubrick is that he almost never planned out his shots. I simply cannot imagine some of the most memorable shots in the film being unplanned. In a way though it makes perfect sense, since Stanley Kubrick started out as a photographer and cinematography came naturally to him.<br/><br/>I also LOVE Kubrick's choice of music in his films, and A Clockwork Orange is no exception. I think it's genius, and absolutely appropriate, for classical music, such as Beethoven and Rossini, to be used extensively throughout the film. The classical music also fits well because Alex is a lover and fan of Beethoven.<br/><br/>What I also love about Kubrick is that his films have their own style; he didn't like to go with the usual cliches used in lots of films. For example, there is a certain kind of way that he cuts. He doesn't like to cut when not necessary, so he usually holds a shot for long time when it's appropriate to do so. I think these slow cuts can add much drama to a scene. There are a lot of these slow cuts in The Shining, for example, when Jack Torrance is speaking to Grady in the bathroom scene. There is a very dramatic scene in A Clockwork Orange that also uses these slow, infrequent cuts: when Alex returns home from being ""treated,"" he discovers that a fellow named Joe has replaced him in his own home. This way of cutting has influenced me tremendously, and I have incorporated it into some of my own short films. <br/><br/>Malcolm McDowell could not have been a better choice for the role of Alex. I recently watched the film If... for the first time, and I can clearly see why Kubrick decided to cast him. Besides McDowell, I also particularly love the performances of both Patrick Magee and Philip Stone, both of which have roles in Barry Lyndon, and the latter having another role in The Shining as Delbert/Charles Grady. <br/><br/>Beneath the surface, A Clockwork Orange is a very intelligent work of art that can lead to many different interpretations or meanings. There are several themes or meanings that I believe can be interpreted throughout the film: man versus society; anarchy versus total government control; freewill versus the abuse of freewill; etc. One could also argue, and Kubrick has discussed this himself, that the film portrays the left- and right-wing characters as equal in terms of means and ends but differing in terms of beliefs. The film also portrays the philosophy (and I quote Kubrick once again) that ""society is imperfectly structured because of the nature of man."" Alex starts out as a criminal, murderer, and rapist. But he ends up becoming a Clockwork Orange when society deals with him in ways that may be just as bad as, or even worse than, the evil crimes that Alex committed himself. The doctors use a brainwashing technique, known as the Ludovico technique, to treat Alex. The film, in my opinion, becomes more interesting when it goes full circle, and Alex ends up back to where he started - as an evil criminal without any ""goodness"" within him. But the biggest reason why I love this full-circle transformation that occurs within Alex is that I believe that Alex ends up rejecting what society has not only given to him, but forced into him. A Clockwork Orange is not just a work of art or a masterpiece of a film, but it's something that everyone can relate to in one way or another. Let's use school as an example (the film If... with Malcolm McDowell is a great example of a film that directly shows this). I believe that learning and education are both important. However, I also believe that true learning must come from within. When learning becomes a requirement in school, students can start rejecting the education that is being given to them. Therefore, the students start defying the teachers and the staff members at school. This is not always the case with everyone, but I certainly had a similar reaction myself while I was in high school. That's when the issues portrayed in A Clockwork Orange come into play. As Stanley Kubrick explained, we can all identify with Alex on the unconscious level, but we don't all become Alexes ""as a result of morality, the law and sometimes our own innate character."" There are so many more things that could be said about A Clockwork Orange, which is why Stanley Kubrick tended not to speak too much about the meanings of his films. Stanley Kubrick, from an interview regarding Full Metal Jacket, has explained, ""If a film has any substance or subtlety, whatever you say is never complete, it's usually wrong, and it's necessarily simplistic: truth is too multifaceted to be contained in a five-line summary. If the work is good, what you say about it is usually irrelevant."" Nevertheless, I cannot see the film the same way (with disgust) that I saw it immediately following my initial viewing. For example, I know for a fact that Stanley Kubrick never did glorify violence nor rape; I think that believing something like that is way too simplistic. To show the various crimes of ultra-violence that Alex commits during the beginning of the film is simply to develop the character of Alex as an evil sociopath. I currently continue to think about A Clockwork Orange - all the time, in fact - and I think it accurately illustrates the nature of man in an unbiased way.<br/><br/>Overall, I believe A Clockwork Orange to be a timeless societal, political, and philosophical commentary open to subjective interpretation. I, therefore, urge viewers to watch this film with an open mind and allow themselves to put their own interpretation on it. I understand that it may be extremely difficult for many viewers to see much brilliance and beauty in the film after an initial viewing due to the ""ultra-violence"" and extremities portrayed in the film. I furthermore urge viewers to watch the film more than once, to appreciate it as stimulating masterpiece of cinema."
"lefifol","10","1","1","5 November 2017"," A movie which can change a life !!
","Have you ever seen « Clockwork Orange »? If you have never seen this movie before I recommend you to do it as soon as possible. Inspired by Anthony Burgess's novel, this movie is a real gold mine. Realised by the famous director Stanley Kubrick and shot in England, ""Clockwork Orange"" is released in 1972, eleven years after the publication of the book.<br/><br/>The plot takes place in England, in a future world. More exactly in a town where the young people, by the violence, took power and manage everything by fear. The central figure, played by Malcolm McDowell, is a young man, Alex, who is radically inclined towards violence and sex. He commits the worst crimes with some friends but Alex is finally arrested. Two years after his arrest, Alex volunteers to participate in a whole new experience. From then on, he is tortured in the only purpose to disgust him of violence and prevent Alex from hurting again. Believing to have reached their goal, the investigators of the experiment release Alex who is, nevertheless, still deeply nasty. Alex, once released, considers himself as free to resume his life as before. Unfortunately (or not), he quickly realizes that violence makes him sick, gives him nausea and, above all, is everywhere. Indeed, wherever he looks, he sees some violence. He then realizes that if he wants to distance himself from the society, he should maybe live more ""healthily"".<br/><br/>Finally, without any known actors (in Europe), the screenplay of the movie is really original and surprising. It is a beautiful satire of our current society and a subtle warning to the young people nowadays. Everyone can find an interest in this movie, even if it is hard psychologically. Never boring, the leading actor manages to move the audience while he plays a devilish being. Eventually, I will never recommend you enough to watch this movie which, personally, changed my view of life."
"joecoby45","9","1","1","19 October 2017"," Fantastic, and totally unique.

","After hearing about this movie for years I finally saw it, and all I can say is WOW!  What a statement this movie makes about the human mind and the human spirit.

"OpIV-2","10","1","1","27 March 1999"," A missunderstood movie and an equally misunderstood man
","This movie is not intended to congratulate criminals, or encourage violent crimes in anyway. It's intent was to show that we have to make our decisions ourself, no other human-being can. The main reason why it is misunderstood is because it excludes the 21st chapter that is in the book. This chapter tells of Alex's redemption, and his need to settle down. Alex wrong. Plain and simple, Anthony Burgess would never condone rape, for his wife was raped. But Alex realizes this at the end when he can think for himself and a ""treatment"", as it were, was not thinking for him. In other words, if you had a disability would you want someone taking care of you constantly, always making a fuss. No it's disconcerting, as humans we want to learn for ourself and be self-sufficient. That's what this is about. Alex got his punishment in jail, and out of jail, but in the end the human brain prevailed and he recognized the err of his ways. I strongly suggest to anyone confused after the movie to go read the book. This will help you to understand the reasoning of it being taken from Alex's perspective. In closing I would like give my condolences to Christiane Kubrick on the loss of her husband. He was a genius and his legacy is left in films like this one. And to Stanley, wherever you are, Good luck, God-speed, and Good bye. You will be missed."
"cjwynes","9","1","1","5 January 2002"," Still startling, one of Kubrick's best
","Minor spoilers<br/><br/>The plot of this film involves a group of street thugs having a bit of<br/><br/>fun at the expense of everyone they meet.  The groups young<br/><br/>leader, Alex, finally runs afoul of the law and decides to enter a<br/><br/>new re-education program to ""cure"" himself of violent behaviour. <br/><br/>There are better plot synopses out there, I leave the rest to them,<br/><br/>and turn to reviewing the content.<br/><br/>Another reviewer remarked that the violence, considered<br/><br/>outrageous at the time this film was released, no longer seemed<br/><br/>shocking on screen.  Despite the recent explosion in violent<br/><br/>imagery on film, Clockwork Orange does not seem dated at all. <br/><br/>Modern violence scenes, even those in which the characters<br/><br/>express as little remorse as Alex and his pals do in this film, seem<br/><br/>to be more emotional.  The use of classical music in the<br/><br/>background of violent imagery, or Alex's rendition of Singing in the<br/><br/>Rain as he beats the liberal author and rapes his wife, somehow<br/><br/>separate the action on screen from the normal emotions a viewer<br/><br/>would feel upon seeing such things.  Because of that, this film<br/><br/>struck me as far more violent than any of the Tarantino-style flicks<br/><br/>released these days.<br/><br/>The moral issues discussed in Clockwork Orange are even more<br/><br/>fascinating than the wonderful portrayals of detached violence.  As<br/><br/>a civil libertarian, people sometimes face me with the question of<br/><br/>whether I could hold onto those ideals if it were *my* loved ones<br/><br/>whose security were threatened.  I enjoyed seeing the liberal<br/><br/>author face this dilemma when Alex suddenly reappears in his life.<br/><br/>This is probably the 3rd Kubrick film to watch, behind Strangelove<br/><br/>and Full Metal Jacket, and before Shining.  If you need a fifth<br/><br/>Kubrick film to watch, just watch Strangelove again.  The<br/><br/>similiarities between Orange and 2001 begin and end with the<br/><br/>score, despite 2001's ""cameo"" appearance during Alex's trip to the<br/><br/>record store.  I never miss a chance to warn Kubrick fans to stay<br/><br/>away from the horrible 2001, but Clockwork Orange I highly<br/><br/>recommend to any fan of other Kubrick films."

"Andrew-162","10","1","1","14 July 2000"," 2nd most poetic and artistic
","Aside from Alfred Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"", A Clockwork Orange is probably the most poetic and artistic movie ever made. From it's haunting and downright frightening first shot of Alex's face (with his perfectly constructed wardrobe and one fake eyelash, an idea nothing short of genius), to the dialogue (consisting mainly of Nasdat, a language similar to english though certain terms are used in replacement of our terms. Example: Good=Horrorshow, In-Out, In-Out=Sex), to the ultra-modern houses that Alex and his droogs raid, to the ironic and disturbing idea of having Alex sing ""Singing In The Rain"" while shamelessly raping a middle-aged woman, to the fish eye lens shots Kubrick uses to capture imagery, to the contraption that forces Alex to watch the ludivico video, and finally to the overall question of the entire movie: What is it better for a man to be--naturally evil or mechanically enforced good? Alex has a chance to experience them both.<br/><br/>Now to the plot: Alex (Malcolm McDowell)is a disturbed youth who spends his days faking sick from school so he and his droogs (friends) can drink milk-plus at a bar or go out for ""a little of the ultra-violence"" It is kind of like a gang of theirs, which Alex leads, consisting of 4 members. They wear the same costumes, fight other gangs, beat up homeless drunks, rape innocent women and sometimes kill them, and try to run cars off the road. Alex is obsessed with Beethoven, who he refers to as ""Ludwig Van"". He associates Beethoven with sexual violence. After he angers his droogs and puts down a potential mutiny through (what else?) violence, they decide to double cross him by knocking him out after he kills a woman, leaving him for the police. He hates it in prison, but he manages to humour the religious head there by pretending to be interested in the bible (all he really cares about in the bible are the sexual and violent parts, which he imagines himself in). Through gaining the religious head's favor, he is allowed to get off early for his crimes, on one condition--he undergoes the ""Ludovico Treatment"": a treatment supposed to cure the need for violence. The treatment consists of holding Alex in a chair, putting him in a straitjacket, forcing his eyelids to stay open by putting hooks under his eyes, keeping his head stationary, and thereby forcing him to watch the video that they display: A video of sexual violence with a soundtrack of bastardized Beethoven music. Alex is absolutely shellshocked at the sights and sounds of this video. After he watches it, you see him on a stage crouching down. A topless woman walks onto the stage. He reaches for her breasts. Before his hands can get there, he crumples over and starts gagging. Whenever Alex now thinks a violent thought, he becomes unbearably sick. Then he goes back into the everyday world, where the tables are turned on him in almost every way.... Malcolm McDowell's performance perhaps ranks among the 10 best ever given. His brave portrayal of an absolutely monstrous teen is so frighteningly believable that the mere sight of him is scary. The music is appropriately moody, as it is in all Kubrick movies. The art direction is flawless, as is the cinematography. This is the most Kubrickesque of all his films, and probably his best overall. The surreal atmosphere is disturbingly relevant, though perhaps not at first glance. This movie deserved oscars for best picture, best actor, best director, best adapted screenplay, best cinematography, best art direction, best costume design, and best sound. IT GOT NONE OF THEM!!! It was nominated for best picture, best director, best adapted screenplay, and best editing. What did it lose to in all 4 categories? THE FRENCH CONNECTION!!! The two movies are completely incomparable--The French Connection seems so shallow compared to A Clockwork Orange. It's losing to The French Connection ranks among the top 5 mishaps of the oscars: the other 4 being Citizen Kane losing to How Green Was My Valley, an unnominated Vertigo losing to GIGI?!?!, Goodfellas losing to Dances With Wolves, and Pulp Fiction losing to Forrest Gump (Honorable mention goes to an unnominated Usual Suspects losing to the poorly acted Braveheart). In retrospect, one wonders how any of them could've happened, but they did. Somehow. See A Clockwork Orange. And if you're one who says it is nothing but ""sexual, ugly rubbish,"" you probably (not definitely) should be forced to be placed in a contraption not unlike the one Alex was forced into, and be forced to watch the movie over and over until you realize the true wonder of cinema that it is."
"TallSneaky1","8","1","1","3 December 1998"," Oscar snubbed!!!
","The French Connection was certainly a great movie, a cinemtaic experience and certainly worthy of an Academy Award for Best Picture. However, how the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences can leave this movie off the list of nominees is an insult to filmmaking. The reason I can fathom is that most of Hollywood was too shocked by the movie's graphic scenes to be entertained. All the same, it is utterly wrong and a pathetic snub. This movie is, in my opinion, the greatest movie that did not win Best Picture."

","Hey, droogs, when you're trying to wrap your yahzick around bolshy great words like ""malenky"" and ""malchick"" without spilling too much red, red kroovy from a burst blood vessel, guess what, that's Russian you're speaking. Just when you were enjoying all that ultraviolence, real horrorshow, and the old in-out, you were really hitting the books. Subversive, isn't it?<br/><br/>The current Penguin edition of Anthony Burgess's novel now makes it clear that your humble narrator's arresting way of speaking is actually Russian (right down to ""horrorshow""), but in olden times you had to figure that out for yourself, assuming that you ever did.<br/><br/>""Clockwork"" may well be a director's Meisterwerk, a stylistic pièce de résistance, but it is at least partially a succès de scandale. I still feel that Kubrick was irresponsible not to include the final chapter of Burgess's novel. Perhaps the film would not still be banned in the Mother Country if he had. It may well have required someone of Kubrick's ingenuity to handle the abrupt change in mood at that point -- assuming that he had shot the ending straight without putting his own ironic twist on it, which is doubtful. And of course this paragraph is predicated on a fairly literal reading of Burgess, but Burgess edited Joyce, so perhaps Burgess should never be taken at face value either.<br/><br/>For all its brilliance, the film needs to be taken cum grano salis. Investigate the book, and draw your own conclusions. (You will even find the explanation for the film's title there.)<br/><br/>Afterthought, since reviewing the other comments: When I first saw this film 20 years or so ago, it was unspeakably violent and physically repellent to watch. This was before the modern wave of crime and horror films. ""Bonnie and Clyde"" and ""The Wild Bunch"" may have opened the floodgates for cinematic violence, but ""A Clockwork Orange"" was in an entire other class. It disturbs me that I can now watch this film without revulsion, and that's not due to overexposure to the film itself which I've only seen a couple of times, but rather to mass culture as a whole."
"richie-29","Null","1","1","24 December 1999"," despite the ultraviolence, one of the most thought provoking films ever made.
","Warning, spoilers ahead:<br/><br/><br/><br/>If Kubrick's previous film, 2001, is meant to show humanity reaching for new heights in space, then A Clockwork Orange reveals that we still have a long way to go on Earth. The homeless man's monologue delivered before Alex and his droogs mercilessly beat him seems to indicate this. Despite the all the rape and ultraviolence depicted in the film, A Clockwork Orange has a decidedly anti-violence message, despite all the acts depicted onscreen. It shows how violence permiates our society, as it seen in the torture treatment of Alex, which allows society to assault and abuse him without any means of defending himself. Another good example of this is the writer, Mr. Alexander. He speaks out against the totalitarian government in power and now has a good chance of overthrowing it when Alex, a victim of the government's policies, shows up at his doorstep. However, when he discovers that Alex is the one who raped and murdered his wife and left him crippled, he plots to force him to commit suicide, As a result, Mr. Alexander is in jail, and the government is still in power, and more popular than ever, all because he succumbed to the urges of hatred and revenge."
"tom-181","Null","1","1","5 November 1998"," ... a hugely original and stylish film that is compelling and very shocking.
","A Clockwork Orange is a powerful and disturbing film that never seems to even attempt to condemn the violence it shows. It is extremely stylish in its look and sound with outrageous costumes and sets and a sinister electronic soundtrack often based on works of Beethoven. Malcolm MacDowell gives an extraordinary performance as Alex, the film's protagonist. For the first half of the film Alex is cold and unfeeling but once he has been imprisoned and given a shocking new conditioning therapy, he becomes a sympathetic character, someone whose life has been destroyed by a cruel justice system. The scene in which Alex goes back to his home after his release and is thrown out by his parents is actually quite moving as you really feel for the character however cruel and heartless he has been earlier in the film. The scene in which Alex is actually given the conditioning therapy and forced to watch scenes of extreme violence is one of the most terrifying and disturbing scenes ever made. Kubrick injects A Clockwork Orange with moments of very dark humour throughout. This adds to the shocking nature of the violence as most scenes of violence are actually played for laughs, however sick they are. The only bad thing about Kubrick's film is that he changes the ending from the original one in Anthony Burgess' novel. The original gives the message that the only thing that will reform a criminal is if he wants to change himself. Kubrick seems to be saying that someone like Alex cannot change at all and the evil inside him is always there. Overall,a hugely original and stylish film that is compelling and very shocking. A Clockwork Orange will not be to everyone's taste but watch it with an open mind and you will see what is possibly one of the best films of the last 30 years."

Nope, I don't buy it.<br/><br/>This films' entire world is patently two-dimensional (to its discredit) and, quite frankly, boring. I had to attempt to watch the film several times before I finally made my way through its entirety, as I found myself simply turning it off out sheer boredom. The visual style is interesting, I'll grant that. But nothing else about the characters, story or message (such as it is) was able to hold my attention at all. Its gibberish, then violence, then more gibberish, then more violence, The End.<br/><br/>I don't see how any intelligent individual can walk away from this film thinking it was good in any way. And I'm not making a moral judgment at all, mind you. Yeah, the characters are reprehensible... but that is beside the point. You can have a great movie with reprehensible characters... just not when you hang the entire premise of the film on some pornography of violence, then wrap it up in pseudo-intellectual claptrap and hope people are so confused that they mistake laziness for brilliance.<br/><br/>In this case, that particular gambit seems to have worked, as 'smart' and 'cool' people all agree in unison that Clockwork Orange is a great film. Unfortunately, it is not."
"johnmschofield","2","6","15","21 October 2009"," After a number of attempts I finally gave up on this film
","I thought this film had been banned in Britain after its release but just today I found out that it hadn't been banned at all. Anyway I didn't watch this film until about 8 years ago and unfortunately I fell asleep and missed the majority of the film. I have since tried on a number of occasions to watch it all and have only managed to watch it in its entirety twice. I have come to the conclusion that this film is just not for me. I always try to find something positive in any film I watch but I could not find anything in this film to admire. The whole experience was in the absence of a more appropriate word, boring. I have no doubt that the cast and crew were well intentioned and believed they had done a reasonable job at the time but in my opinion the film is 136 minutes of self indulgent rubbish and it appears today to be very dated. I might have reacted differently if I had watched it at the time of its release but somehow I doubt it. I know I am in the minority who just don't like this film but that has never bothered me. There are a handful of films which I have seen which fall into my own category of 'a waste of time and money' and this is one of them. I cannot recommend anyone watch this film but I suggest they do, so you can make up your own mind up about it but please don't get tangled up with the enormous amount of positive or negative hype which has always surrounded this film."

","The plot is course, that future England is ruled by gangs. Alex deLarge(Malcolm McDowell) and his ""droogs"" go around committing ""ultra-violence"" and raping women. One night, after murdering a woman with a giant phallic statue, Alex's droogs knock him out and leave him for the police. The police use him in the ""Ludovico treatment"", in which they lid-lock him and make him watch documentaries of concentration camps while he is drugged to get sick, so that he will associate violence with becoming ill. But when he gets out of jail, it has disastrous consequences for him.<br/><br/>First of all, we need to remember that a common motif in Stanley Kubrick's movies is insanity. We might jump to say that Alex is insane. But we need to realize that he is a product of this society that created him, and he grew up in the slums, so we shouldn't expect him to be a ""model citizen"". Moreover, after the police arrested him, they don't look at why he was committing ultra-violence; their solution is to mentally castrate him. So really, the government is insane in this case.<br/><br/>And what does the title mean? Well, a clock is man-made, and an orange is natural. Humans, including Alex, are also natural. But after they put him through the Ludovico treatment, he can only obey them. In effect, he becomes like a machine...a sort of clock. What about Alex's name? I read somewhere that it could be a combination. The word ""a"" in Greek means ""without"", and ""lex"" in Latin means ""law"", so his name could suggest ""lawless"".<br/><br/>What about some of the movie's other aspects? Alex's false eyelash makes him look asymmetrical, as if to say that something about him isn't right. Mr. Alexander (Patrick Magee), whose wife Alex rapes, is confined to a wheelchair (like Dr. Strangelove?), and after Alex is cured of being ultra-violent, Mr. Alexander becomes as sadistic as Alex used to be. Alex is one of Beethoven's biggest fans. We view Beethoven as a great composer (and he certainly was), but in a drawing of him, he looks almost insane. Alex at one point thinks about Jesus, and during the Ludovico treatment, he has several wires all over his head, and they suggest a crown of thorns.<br/><br/>There are so many messages that one can read into ""A Clockwork Orange"". As one of Kubrick's many masterpieces, it shows him to be one of the greatest directors of all time."

This goes on for a VERY long time. Horrible things happen to him, but we don't really care, because he's a bad person.<br/><br/>The movie is extremely long and drawn out. It climaxes so many times that it's very anti-climatic by the ending.<br/><br/>We are supposed to get a sense of irony out of Alex going from a sociopath to someone who is constantly being beaten and tortured while he can't use the very thing that got him in the situation, violence, to help himself. We do not get this sense of irony because the movie is CONTRIVED, some examples being: how Alex just happens to run into everyone he ever did wrong one day after getting out of jail (the bum, his droogs, the cripple), or how after Alex luckily is not recognized by the cripple, he goes on to sing the SONG HE SANG WHILE BEATING HIM AND RAPING HIS WIFE while in the cripple's house, as if he were the most idiotic person in the world, which he is obviously not.<br/><br/>The fight scenes are silly and anything but ""ultra violent"".<br/><br/>The atmosphere of the movie is redeeming and there is some cult/shock value.

The acting is on a very high level and Malcolm Mcdowell gives an outstanding performance. The scrip is well written and the plot is intriguing. I can go on and list many other things that make this movie a masterpiece but probably the most important one is the storytelling. Kubric has shown that he is a good storyteller and this movie proves it undoubtedly.<br/><br/>Let's not forget how controversial ""A Clockwork Orange"" is.

","Before I begin my review I would like to point out a few things about my movie preferences, yes, I don't mind watching mindless entertainment like Transformers, The Avengers, The Expendables etc. I also enjoy deeper viewing experiences like Apocalypse Now, The Dark Knight, Inception, Life of Pie, Schindler's List and books like Stranger in a Strange Land etc.<br/><br/>I'm fine with a movie that knows it isn't thought provoking or trying to convey a deep philosophical message and does nothing but try to take you for a fun ride (much like a theme park ride doesn't try to answer 'why are we here?').<br/><br/>I'm also fine with a movie that is making a statement about the human condition, is philosophical or tries to be more than 'fun'.<br/><br/>My issue is when a movie tries to be philosophical/deep, jams it's message down your throat and in doing so ignores character development/plot and is simultaneously boring.<br/><br/>I know exactly what certain people will think when they read this 'HE JUST Doesn't GET IT... MORON!'. So for those people I'll provide my reasoning why I disliked this movie and why I thinks it's all style and clever cinematography to convey a sense of 'intelligence', with no substance.<br/><br/>The philosophical messages of the film are free will VS conformity to societies morals (practically jammed down your throat and I think it's been done better and in more intelligent ways since it's release), youth rebellion and boredom, inherent human evilness, discovering yourself and social taboos.<br/><br/>The main character is completely unsympathetic and uninteresting. He is a jerk of the highest caliber and boring. Musical preference does not change this, attacking defenseless people is not scary, he is a thug and he's not intelligent. I'm fine with the whole 'some people are just bad' cliché but at least give them some type of noteworthy attributes e.g. The Jokers intelligence and deviousness. Simply having a twisted mind does not count and in my opinion, other than being a somewhat handsome guy he wasn't charismatic, although that's debatable.<br/><br/>Using risqué footage in your film doesn't automatically make it meaningful.<br/><br/>Relying on clever camera work to create a certain atmosphere around your character doesn't automatically make it meaningful.<br/><br/>If you removed the clever camera work, the musical score, the interesting set designs/costumes you would essentially have a soft core porno with an uninteresting story to match. Seriously watch the film again and try to imagine if these things were absent.<br/><br/>The story is, gang leader prays on the weak, gets caught, undergoes controversial treatment which is ultimately unsuccessful...

","This is the authorized but altered for America version and least attractive to the author Anthony Burgess. Originally Alex was the anti- hero sees the error of his wicked ways. Alex is the whimsical yet mischievous rascal in the American version as suggested by the publicist that never quite learns his lesson in spite of everyone he is up to his old tricks at the end. It is a That Darn Cat! Meets American Psycho. Disturbing. Offensive. Caters to depravity, rape, murder and cruelty as long as it is a 1st or 2nd degree felony. I would have given it a higher rating for a student film. Maybe for the day it was something special. For me it just set the stage for many to copy the shock and awe of a sideshow that was wildly blooming societal cancer. The women were beautiful. The way they were used was ugly. Nudity, sex and love making have much greater depth than this crazed episode. The hero of the film leads a gang that murders a harmless old man that has had too much to drink. They lie their way into a home then invade raping, beating and torturing the woman and man that let them in. The only way not to criticize this film is to praise it and quickly move on with a deep breath and a pallet cleanser. The movie says ""This is a really bad thing but I will tempt you and show you how to love it and live with a nagging, unhappy conscience forever tainted and damaged."" Child porn with adult actors. Every creepy thing you ever feared about awkward situations. I guess you could say it was something, hype. Hyped like the wizard in the Wizard of OZ. Every sick thing you every thought the babysitter might do in your absence. If I was crack piped out of my head and decided to make a movie I'd wash down some pills with moonshine and this would be it. It says, ""Watch my movie and I will reward you with nudity in all the wrong ways that will influence weak minds to commit heinous crimes."" A cautionary tale for an audience that is too young to view it. It's like watching the possessed demon in the Exorcist run for president. The women were carefully chosen and shown according to their physical appearance used to make the unsavory parts more bearable. The rest of the movie makes supremacists, water boarding, prison rape and torch bearing homicidal vigilantes look normal and successful. The present day equivalent would be the conviction, treatment and reinstatement of a sexual predator after much suffering and the ability to put the blame on the government (A Clockwork Orange 2). Murder now seems considered marginally justifiable depending on which propaganda you follow as long as you don't get caught by the proper authorities or political party. I cannot say enough about this film. Watch it. It's bad for you. <br/><br/>The British book version including the 21st chapter and original ending is preferable but still a cringe to read."

","Clockwork orange, the story of a young man called Alex and his gang of teenagers, the kind of boys that loved do drugs, drink, skip school, and wreak havoc during the night. The movie shows a complete metamorphosis of the main character (Alex) who loved ultra-violence, Beethoven, who was the leader of the gang, and was rude and disrespectful towards his other droogs, and, in a higher level, with the people that suffer his wreak havoc. Alex become in a complete different man contrary to the man he used to be, and his ""new brain"" forces him to hate what he used to love. Thanks to this change, the hangman (Alex) was the victim and his old victims were the hangmen.<br/><br/>This movie doesn't seem to belong to any particular time; You can find situations and behaviors similar to those shown in the movie. It doesn't matter if it's now or ten or twenty years ego, its messages can be applied to any epoch. One of the messages that this movie gives us is: ""old sins have long shadows"", in other words: late or soon you have to face the consequences of your acts, and that happened to Alex. From other point of view, the movie can make us reflect on the possibility that other person or think can have to control our mind, our decisions, our life. They don't have to use medicines or special treatments to make us live under their control, they only feed our mind day after day with the concept of ""perfect or ideal life"", they construct our dreams and goals around this concept. The special treatment in our case are those material things we ""need"" and the media that every they wanna sell us all necessary things to build that perfect life. Do We actually live like we would like to live, or we live like this ""treatment"" wants we to live? think about it."

","Viewing this film nearly half a century after the fact, it looks extremely dated and, dare I say, amateurish. About the only thing Kubrick got right was his depiction of an increasingly violent society. His mind-numbing emphasis on sexual iconography comes across as schoolboy prurience. Surprising, in light of the finesse with which he handled the subject of sex in ""Lolita."" It's clear ""A Clockwork Orange"" was intended to shock and break boundaries in mainstream movies. Mike Nichols did a much better job of it in 1971 with ""Carnal Knowledge"" which holds up beautifully today and has a lot more depth to it."

"ana-gezi30","4","3","6","12 May 2013"," Like a punch in the head
","***POSSIBLE SPOILERS***<br/><br/>First time a saw 'A Clockwork orange', I just didn't know what to think about it. It left me utterly depressed and confused, felt like Kubrick just performed ultra-violence on my soul. I was 15 at that time (just like Alex deLarge), and I was watching it on some German channel without subtitles, with German synchronisation. I had no idea what kind of movie I was watching. Right from the beginning it was completely weird and dreamlike which was appealing but when the white gang went into that house with the big neon sign 'HOME' in front of it, a real horror begun. Because of that sign I thought Alex and his gang were going to his parents's house and those people inside really looked like some ordinary 'mum' and 'dad' in their leisure time. So when the infamous 'rape sequence' started, it was like a nightmare to me, felt like a movie went completely wrong at that point just for the sake of being shocking and disgusting in its literal attack on family, women and everything else. Some says it's a silly and entertaining scene. Well how about punk girls attacking pretty handsome males and then cutting their clothes and sexually humiliate them while singing 'Girls just want to have fun', because that is what they need to feel happy and be free? However, after this horrible atrocity, movie didn't get much better, just shock after shock after shock like a punch in the head, all with aggressive and tasteless visual style (thanks a lot, Kubrick). Behind that, I had to admit that composition of frames and use of music are some of the best I have ever seen on a film ( I own the soundtrack of ACO). It's so good it stucks forever into your head. But also got the feeling that the whole movie would be better with less hysterical and vulgar characters that are handled with some compassion, not just to appear in one scene and then disappear from the whole movie without a good reason (specially female characters, they are just horrible, hollow Playboy caricatures). Thanks to that the movie fails into some bad British comedy desperately trying to provoke with something that is known already. We all know that government is corrupted, police is violent, scientists are evil, youth is stupid and senseless and so on. It's nice and easy to accuse somebody else for our problems and behavior, but world will never change to something better because of that.<br/><br/>It also looks like this film was purposely made to appeal to young men with not enough life experience(skinheads, punks and various kinds of geeks)with its untamed ugliness, cheap female nudity and expression of blind immature rage at the world that tries to restrain their wild instincts. But when one grow up into mature person, he can naturally perform this taming on himself. And that was the big Kubrick's mistake, to change the end of original story into something so banal like pure celebration of violence. And now Rob Zombie continues this path with his violent and awful characters in every single movie he made,'cause ultra-violence is so cool. What have you done Kubrick?:( <br/><br/>And those sculptures in the movie.. so horribly tasteless, like lots of 'erotic' art from 70's anyway."

","Few years ago, I read this book (by Anthony Burgess). It was definitely one of my favourites, although it was hard to read(mainly due to Russian slang). The point was, should we take away abuser's and criminal's free will in order to reduce violence and crimes? Since I read it, I was eager to watch the film. The movie literally follows the book, showing young Alex's criminal adventures and his way of living life without conscience, even using the same slang as in the book. Watcher shouldn't have any trouble following the movie's story. I was fascinated how the poor man (who's wife has been raped by Alex and his gang) was realistically presented, with all his anger and revenge waiting for the right moment to destroy Alex. This movie points out from every other movie I've watched, it has unpretentious and specific story that has never been covered before and that is why it should be watched. Now, why did I mention you shouldn't watch it if you read the book first? In my case, I imagined the plot happening somewhere in godforsaken parts of London, or some big English city, in 70's or 80's. I believe it's mentioned somewhere in the book that plot takes place around that time. I did not imagine Alex, his gang and parents, and some other people wearing futuristic suits looking like they popped out from year 2100. And his mom having pink hair? I don't think so. People living in newest modern architecture houses and buildings, when it's actually year seventy-something? I really don't think so. That was something that really irritated me, at some point I even got bored of the movie. That is why I suggested, if you want to really enjoy this movie,don't read the book."

","I realize that this is my own personal opinion, but I consider this to be the best movie I have ever seen.<br/><br/>I saw it first when I was 16, about the age of the main character, Alex, in the movie.<br/><br/>I first saw the movie, then I read the book. This is one of the few times that I ever thought a movie was better than the book. Not to take away anything from the book at all. It itself is a masterpiece, but this movie somehow made a remarkable book even more remarkable.<br/><br/>Everyone who has said that it is too disturbing or violent has completely missed the point. First of all, I have seen many more violent movies in my life, this is tame compared to some of them. Second of all, the sex and violence in this movie is an integral part. That is what it is about. It is about how sex and violence have been desensitized so much that it is the norm for young people.<br/><br/>Alex doesn't know that there is any other option. He is a product of his society. When he rapes and kills that woman, it is not because he is sick, but because society is sick, partly discerned by the fact that the woman is killed by him with a phallic statue that she has in her own home.<br/><br/>He is shown making love to some girls that he met in a record store, illustrating again that sex is a meaningless activity, only to be used for pleasure and not as an important part of life.<br/><br/>When he is arrested it seems to be more to set an example than to right a wrong. Society and the law seem to be more interested in making themselves look good, rather than justice.<br/><br/>He is arrested by his former cohorts, which only goes to show that the government is more interested in appearances than it is about what is right and wrong.<br/><br/>When society comes up with a solution to ""fix"" Alex, through mind control, which is one of the most memorable scenes in movie history, the scene with Alex's eyes pried open, it does fix him, at least temporarily, but it does not fix the society he lives in. He does not change at all, not because he can't or won't, but because society has not changed.<br/><br/>Maybe it never will.<br/><br/>This movie is a fable for our time, even though it was made 40 years ago. If we don't learn the lessons put forth in this film, we are destined to live it and suffer the consequences."

","A Clockwork Orange is set in England in the near future where the teenage thug Alex (Malcolm McDowell) & his gang of Drrogs roams the streets beating up, killing & raping anyone they like. After murdering a woman (Miriam Karlin) with a giant penis Alex is caught by the police, convicted of murder & sentenced to fourteen years in prison. After spending two years in prison Alex agrees to take part in revolutionary Ludovico Treatment which psychologically conditions violent & sexual urges, after a two week treatment course Alex is released completely cured. However Alex finds himself in a harsh world unable to make any moral choice, unable to fight back or protect himself Alex is beaten up & left for dead. Seeking help Alex finds himself at the house of writer Frank Alexander (Patrick Magee) whom was left crippled by Alex & his Droogs several years earlier, Frank decides to try & make Alex commit suicide & both gain revenge & bring the Government down in a blaze of bad publicity...<br/><br/>This American & English co-production was written & directed by Stanley Kubrick based on the novel by Anthony Burgess, one of the more controversial films released by a major studio A Clockwork Orange has quite a reputation & while in terms of violence & sex it can't really hope to compare with more recent offerings this is a fine film that has meaning, intelligence & makes a statement that is still relevant even now over forty years after it was originally made. Now that's visions, right? The social political story about rampant youth crime, overcrowded prisons, victims rights, rehabilitation, probation, psychiatric cures, the breakdown of the family unit & law & order feels totally contemporary & you can see that the Kubrick's vision of a future Britian really isn't that far off from the way things are now with all the issues & themes raised in A Clockwork Orange still relevant today, if not even more so than back in 1971. From inmates using the bible to fuel their sexual & violent fantasies to the corruption & underhand use of the system, from Alex starting out as a thug & then being cured only for a public media outcry which claim Alex's human rights have been violated while ignoring his victims so he is simply to be at the end to carry on as a thug free as a bird. I found the issues & themes very timely & the film as a whole fascinating to watch but at two & a quarter hours long it goes on forever, I doubt I would want to sit through it again & Alex goes from monster to hero & back again so your never quite sure what to feel for him but I suspect this was intentional on Kubrick's part & is admittedly done in a clever & manipulative way. Although always watchable & engaging some may find A Clockwork Orange a little slow at times & the strange language which is apparently a mix of English, Russian & slang may be off-putting for some although I always new what was being spoken about & thought the abstract dialogue was rather entertaining & very amusing in places.<br/><br/>While the issues & themes in A Clockwork Orange haven't dated at all what about the visual look of the film? Well, apart from some bad 70's colours & technology this still looks great & hasn't dated badly at all. There are some great scenes, some poetic violence set to classical music like when two rival gangs of thugs fight each other to Rossini's Thieving Magpie & Alex's liking for Ludwig Van Beethoven's ninth means it's used throughout. The Ludovico treatment scene has Alex strapped into a chair with metal hooks holding his eyes open in what must have been an incredibly painful & uncomfortable scene to film.<br/><br/>With a supposed budget of about $2,200,000 A Clockwork Orange turned out to be one of the biggest money makers of 1971, nominated for four Oscar's & seven BAFTA's it actually won none of either. Filmed here in England almost entirely on location, Woolwich Barracks prison was used for the interior prison scenes while the exterior was actually Wandsworth prison. The acting is very good, I am sure McDowell suffered for the part both physically & mentally. Having said that everyone seems to shout a lot & everyone plays it over the top with some funny facial expressions.<br/><br/>A Clockwork Orange is a really good film, I would maybe stop just short of calling it a classic or even a great film as it's a bit too long & the artsy mix of culture & violence & sex may put some off. The themes & issues are bang on & it's a clever film by a visionary filmmaker but as I said, I don't think I would want to see it again."

However, the shock and awe campaign only goes so far. It wears off soon after Alex is caught, and once he begins his treatment he, and the movie, lose their mojo and the rest is fairly trite and predictable. 3 1/2 out of 5 stars."

","""The creative person is both more primitive and more cultivated, more destructive, a lot madder and a lot saner, than the average man."" – Frank Barron.<br/><br/>""Repressive desublimation"" was the term German philosopher Herbert Marcuse employed to describe the process whereby people unwittingly give over their liberties to tyrants in favour of material or sensual satisfactions. At first glance the term seems oxymoronic. Why? Because in Freudian psychology, ""sublimation"" refers to the process whereby a natural human drive (eg sex) is transferred or ""sublimated"" into a more socially acceptable form (eg film or music). ""Desublimation"", however, posits the reverse. Here the subject's allowed unrestricted, direct access to their desires (eg porn, rape).<br/><br/>By attaching the seemingly contradictory modifier of ""repressive"", Marcuse thus challenges common sense to come to terms with the potentially repressive effects of desublimation. In other words, when the gratification of immediate material and sensual needs becomes the prevailing concern of men, then the ideals of freedom or even democracy have no chance.<br/><br/>Marcuse's analysis of this problem is of course relevant to our own political culture today, in which policy decisions are increasingly founded upon an economic logic rather than that of freedom or the preservation of liberty. But this was the case even 50 years ago, when Marcuse travelled to the US, then the wealthiest, supposedly the most ""open"" society in the world, and tried to warn people about what he called the ""encroaching totalitarianism of the capitalist Establishment"" - the very regime under which the US had achieved its enviable position in the world. <br/><br/>Marcuse believed that postmodern capitalism had ""internalised"" Marxism (at least in its Stalinist deformation) and would increasingly resemble a perverse hybrid of Soviet-style totalitarianism and US-style consumerism. In this world, commodities, art and objects are not just a means of distraction, but the ""Ideology"" itself.<br/><br/>Of course no one took Marcuse seriously, but he expected this. ""Where is the repression in a society in which copies of the works of Plato, Hegel, Marx and Freud are available in the drugstore for anyone who cares to read them?"" Marcuse asks in his book, ""One-Dimensional Man"". In other words, given that the resources of principled rational opposition are everywhere available, must one not presume that the absence of such opposition is indicative of the absence of any reason to question or oppose the status quo, even indeed of the actuality of freedom in the West? <br/><br/>Marcuse's answer is that one must not so presume; to do so would be to confuse happiness with freedom, contentment with emancipation. The logic of repressive desublimation was then supposed to be Marcuse's critical response to this presumption. By allowing – even encouraging - certain forms of desublimation (freedom), Marcuse argues, systems actually distract attention from their oppressive and authoritarian character. On a more subtle and dangerous level, the availability of ""Plato in the drugstore"" actually works to undermine the possibility of taking a critical stand against the repressive aspects of the society, firstly, because one simply becomes too comfortable to rock the boat, the logic of one's wallet overcoming one's rational judgement, and secondly, because the very availability of Plato in the drugstore operates as a vehicle for the retrenchment of the Establishment. Not only because the Establishment can say to its critics, ""You are free; could you get Plato in the drugstore elsewhere?"", but more subtly and perversely, because in the mind of the subject, the fact of his immediate contentment precludes the possibility of taking Plato seriously.<br/><br/>And this is what Marcuse means by his ""Clockwork"" sounding ""One-Dimensional Society"". Any society that has not reached a state of perfection - and no society has - must necessarily be at least a ""two dimensional"" society - a society in which the status quo and the ideal stand in conflict with each other. It is that conflict which generates change for the better. But in this clockwork society of ours, that second dimension – the utopian dimension - is increasingly vanishing.<br/><br/>Art and philosophy (ie ""high culture"") have traditionally been the guardians of this second, utopian dimension. In art, desire for utopia is sublimated into representations of utopia – either ""positively"" (Bach, Mozart, Hegel), as more or less direct expressions of perfection or beauty, or ""negatively"" (Brecht, Swift, Kubrick, Marx), as representations of the distance or difference or dissonance between the way things are and the way they ought to be.<br/><br/>Today the ""aim"" of ""philosophy"" is not the sublimation of the utopian desire, but rather its desublimation - not art, but action; not philosophy, but revolution. But apart from the effective existence of this second dimension of thought, there is no basis in consciousness for a critical stand toward society, and therefore no basis for practical action. That is the problem of the one-dimensional or clockwork society. And you see that in this film: in Alex's postmodern world of rampant commodification, in which art and objects are now thoroughly impotent, Alex believes the only to be truly free is to transcend into ultra violence; freedom is equated with a specific creativity, a destructive re-energising of objects, performance and art. Or to quote Albert Camus: ""The only way to deal with an unfree world is to become so absolutely free that your very existence is an act of rebellion"".<br/><br/>And this is the dark irony of Marcuse's analysis of repressive desublimation. Today desublimation (rampant, unrestricted desires) is the norm and is indeed the practical result of our economic order; capitalism is devoted to the creation of desire (and the illusion of satiation). We might expect that this would be just what is wanted. But, as Marcuse shows, not all forms of desublimation are emancipatory. Some preclude the possibility of emancipation in subtle ways.<br/><br/>10/10 – Worth multiple viewings."

","I've always wanted to watch a film about Humankind violence through the artistic knacks of Stanley Kubrick, I had high expectations before watching Clockwork Orange, but there I found what I sought for once I did.<br/><br/>It's a movie that is about a young scoundrel with his droogs doing ''ultra-violence'' deeds at night with such a pleasure and unconscious way that makes the movie tone a comedy satire one, Stanley Kubrick depicted this movie in a way to make us aware that violence is something uncontrollable even by the people meant to prevent it to occur (the government),it is considered as a misdeed notwithstanding, it is something that humankind needs.<br/><br/>Alex's performance as the villain character in clockwork orange was key, he succeeded to convey that emotion of someone who is violent and charismatic at the same time, letting us loving him and hating him simultaneously throughout the movie.<br/><br/>the scene where Alex and his fellows are seen raping a woman in front her husband's eyes was so fascinating that made us in a way empathizing our regards at Alex instead of the ''Handicap'' husband!!!! the ''singing in the rain scene ''where Alex is seen doing his violence and raping acts artistically was one hell of a scene, as a matter of fact the performance given by the old man in the scene where he recognized Alex was absolutely tremendous, the sickness and morbidness that the old handicap man showed were really vivid and realistic.<br/><br/>The classical music used by Kubrick extraordinarily matched with the scenes that were meant to catch our attention, we can notice that once the classical music is on, the tempo of the film is getting slower, except the scene where Alex was with the two girls in his room where the tempo of the music was more intense and rapid.<br/><br/>The movie tries to tell us in a way that violence is something that human being can't ignore and it's somehow something that come from our nature, in another way as it is unveiled in the last scene it is something that finally we've got to accept it and make it one of those eternal yet useful misdeeds needed to let life goes on.<br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece is certainly about more than I've mentioned above, I highly recommend it for those who haven't watched it yet."

He's always skipping school and hanging out with good old buddies, until one night he assaulted a woman to death and is now confined for 14 years of manslaughter. After two years the government decides to create a special program that can rehabilitate crooks to normal kind citizens and even after rehabilitation, can Alex hack it even after cure? <br/><br/>Violent and unique Science Fiction drama from master filmmaker Stanley Kubrick is one of his best movies. Inspired by the novel of the same name, this is a shocking and influential movie that co-stars David Prowse (""Star Wars"") and Mcdowell gives the performance of a lifetime, the film is really about the downfall of society in the future due to violence and fascism.

"maggiedb-1","10","3","6","24 October 2009"," The most dangerous film ever made
","No matter how much you hear about this film, you can never prepare yourself for how you would react when you see it.<br/><br/>The plot is simple. Little Alex (Mcdowell) is a dangerous threat to society. He gets captured. And with this, Burgess and Kubrick simply show why criminals should never be rehabilitated and why a healthy society needs violence and crime.<br/><br/>To see this film is an exhilarating, alarming, shocking, disturbing, amazing, fantastic, brilliant, entertaining, uncomfortable, erotic, illustrious, spectacular, theatrical, surrealistic, realistic, horrific experience that no other film can ever match, but will try to match.<br/><br/>From the opening scene where you see our stretch- eyed anti- hero and the wide open white space of the ""Karova milk bar"" you know you are going to witness something you never knew could exist.<br/><br/>This film has so many influential and iconic elements, where can we begin to explain.<br/><br/>The acting: Mcdowell is simply spectacular as Alex. His eye, his stare, his voice, his face, his nature, everything is just brilliant. I think his performance was more powerful than Kubrick could ever have imagined. In a few words- his iconic performance is over the top, restrained and a lot of fun. The rest of the cast is perfect, they just add the right amount of energy to make their performances adequate and to make McDowell shine for the star he is in this particular film.<br/><br/>The directing: Kubrick is nothing short of one of Hollywood's greatest film directors and here we have yet another Kubrick masterpiece that proves it. He is the only director who truly knows how to capture the dark side of human nature with simple filming techniques.<br/><br/>The set design: Futuristic retro minimalism has never looked better. This film is one big interior fantasy with everything from metallic wall papers, egg chairs, stainless steel and glass tables, furniture and walls accentuated with strong purples, blues, reds, yellows, metallics and just plain white.<br/><br/>The score: A Haunting, beautiful, mysterious, exiting and complex noise. It suits the film so well that it feels like an extra character on every scene.<br/><br/>This film is not for the faint hearted, not for the unintelligent and not for the self righteous."
"b_havag","9","3","6","6 March 2009"," Glorifying violence?! No way!
","I read on Wikipedia that this film has been accused of glorifying violence? What the heck? Only people as sick as Alex DeLarge can like and be hungry for more of this after watching him for two hours. Only sociopaths. <br/><br/>Alex DeLarge is a sick, sick character. I felt repulsed, angry, sick and hateful watching him and his doings. It felt good to see him get arrested and tortured by his treatment. <br/><br/>But it hit me that when he got his treatment, the doctors and the politicians responsible was doing virtually the same things to him. They took away Alex's free will by torturing him, threw him out on the street unable to defend himself and when he got beaten up and tortured by the people he had offended earlier in the movie it was really the governments fault. They almost killed him and was applauded for it, even though they were just as evil as him, cause they knew they didn't make him a better man, they were fully aware that they were just restricting him violently to make him a better man TO SOCIETY. <br/><br/>And I felt sick. Just like Alex I felt really nauseous. It all felt so meaningless. Everyone and everything was sick, everyone was violated, everyone got hurt, everyone just thought of themselves and not of others. It made me wanna throw up! The government just wanted to use Alex, first to front their new program, then to ensure that he didn't give them bad publicity after their treatment almost killed him. Yes, he is a sick sociopath, but so is the government people. <br/><br/>They say that Kubricks intention with Clockwork was to attack the treatment. And its probably true, but for me this is just as much a study of all that is bad in mankind, and it really made me feel how bad we humans can be! In the end, Alex turns out just as bad as he started, maybe even worse, because of the violent treatment. And he's glad for it. He's back on the track of violence and raping and he is LOVING it. In Alex' own words: ""I was cured all right"". The violence made him worse. The bastards made the bastard worse.<br/><br/>Many movies glorifies violence. But never before has a movie made me feel THIS repulsed by it. Now, an hour after seeing the movie, I still feel like crap. Violence makes nothing but more violence, and no one can be cured from anything by violent means. This movie showed me, made me FEEL that one thing clearer than anything has ever done before: Nothing good comes out of violence! Absolutely NOTHING! It just strengthens, expands and makes evil. I had never thought that I would love to be repulsed by a movie.<br/><br/>We should think about that after watching violent action movies. Why do we enjoy violence so much? And I'm the first to say that I do so myself! I find movies like Die Hard very entertaining. But why? After all it is horrible, and that is what makes A Clockwork Orange a masterpiece, what makes it unique; it makes us feel the horror of violence and evil. No other movies that I can think of does that, at least not in such a degree that I have felt literally near vomiting. And that effect is outstanding, cause that's how we ought to feel. In a way, Die Hard is a much more dangerous movie to see for children than this, cause it portrays violence as cool and entertaining. And THAT is scary!<br/><br/>So I ask myself: Can you really like and be fascinated by a movie this repulsive? Yes, when it is horrible for a purpose! And the purpose is strong messages against violence and perhaps even more important against the ""justified violence"", that the society does for ""the common good"". I would very much like to give 10/10 but the middle-part could've been paced/altered slightly, so I'll settle for a strong 9/10. Perhaps Kubricks greatest."

","It is a crude film in the which everything that is shown is because it needs to be shown to give it a meaning. At first glance, this seems rude and morbid but every time I look more closely, I understand that all those involved in a lyric violence, plays a key role in the plot and development. The bar, the dresses, masks and the particular gangs, everything is needed. I am charmed with the movie for the mixture of violence, music, heap and the dialect that to the hearing can sound rough. Alex is the a unique character for his way of life with extreme likes. The performance of the main characters is impeccable, each one seems to have born for this role. The only thing that set me up at the first time was the speeching and language that is used. but ti was only the first time because like all the good movies, it doesn't give all in the same time. then I comprehend that this slang is very useful to the movie, in the same way that the ultra-violence. In addition the film leaves us to see a reality that has never been easy to see. The attempts of the State for dominating to everything that one that represents a danger for the balance of this one. In this case the State relied on the science, tries to dominate the part that does us more humans, the power of choice. It is not important if it is chosen towards the bad or good side, the autonomy is one of the principal rights that we have when we do part of a society. In this sense, the movie is futurist because it let us to have a view about the things that are going to happen in the cold war and what nowadays is passing with communication media and the influence of the State on the citizens."

","I'm writing this review years after seeing this movie. The reason?

When you see why he is attracted to Christianity, you will soil yourself! I think this scene illustrates the human condition...we believe all sorts of things without really understanding them, which is why this scene is so funny.<br/><br/>Anyway, this is a movie about a gang of thugs who terrorise people. The State captures one and tries to 'reform' him...using some quite disturbing techniques. Perhaps this film is about human nature and whether it can be changed or not.<br/><br/>This film has many images that will stick with you forever-the sequence where the anti-hero discovers religion; the scene where the State tries to 'reform' the anti-hero, and some of the bizarre art featured in it-like the statues of the ladies in a bar, or the giant rocking gonad.<br/><br/>A disturbing yet funny movie about bad eggs and 'remedies' for them."

"DarthVoorhees","10","3","6","31 December 2007"," ""Oh Bliss""
","Look no further for Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece. A Clockwork Orange is one of the great achievements in film. It's both visually and mentally phenomenal.<br/><br/>Malcolm McDowell gives a breath-taking performance as Alex de Large, a violent hoodlum of a futuristic England who takes delight in making people suffer after drinking down a milk plus at the Korova. McDowell creates an engaging character. He's evil with no moral compass whatsoever and yet we can't help but let him take us along on his journey. The character both fascinated and repulsed me. I never really liked him or had sympathy for him but his charismatic way of telling this story had me hooked. Alex is one of the great characters of film and McDowell and Kubrick do something that only the best storytellers do, they tell a story centered around a villain.<br/><br/>The romantic storyline of good vs evil has been at the center of all most every movie ever made. Clockwork Orange is outstanding in the fact that it isn't your traditional story. There is evil in Clockwork Orange other than Alex and his droogs, it's the society in which Alex has been molded by. Clockwork Orange is a political commentary in more ways than the one usually debated. Anthony Sharp 's Minister is a villain as well. He cares only for political gain and keeping his party in office. Even though Alex has done terrible things we know he is the product of a much greater evil.<br/><br/>Those who accuse the movie of being only a showcase of pornographic violence and sex need to look at the issues and storytelling presented by Clockwork Orange. And those images stay in your head long after you finish watching the film. They make you think and what porn flick has the power to do that? This is the best showcase of Kubrick's direction. Unlike 2001,Spartacus and Dr.Strangelove we have a relatively simple looking film. Yet Kubrick is able to create an astonishing atmosphere with his camera work and cast that he wasn't in those films. 2001's flaw is that it's more of an image based movie but with Clockwork Orange you get picturesque images and a gripping story to go along with it. Kubrick's trademarks are all at their best here, the dark humor, the surreal environment, and the deep psychological journey through the psyche of our main character.<br/><br/>A Masterpiece, ""Real horrorshow"""
"babuska111","10","3","6","21 January 2005"," For all those who think this is crap
","I've recently been reading some of your comments and posts saying this movie is overrated and a piece of ""crap"". I even just read Roger Ebert's own review of it and even he seems to not understand it. Maybe I'm wrong in this, but it seems to me that all you people just seem to not get the movie. Maybe I can explain it to you. The movie is about the ability to control society. The movie asks the question of whether or not society can be controlled without sacrificing art and creativity. Many of people might be asking how I came to conclusion. All I simply did was think about it. Rogert Ebert, in his review, said that the fact that Alex listens to Beethoven was completely pointless and served no point to the meaning and only helped to stylize the film more. He was wrong. The music Alex is so passionate about is supposed to represent art in our society. It is very important to the film. Alex himself represents all the violence in the world. In the film, a hospital attempts to ""cure"" Alex of his need to commit acts of violence but in the process of doing this, they also make him ""allergic"" to Beethoven. What the film is asking is ""can we cure society of violence without sacrificing art?"" This is the meaning to the film. It is not just some film glorifying violence, and it definitely not the definition of the word ""crap"". Please people, think about a film more before you start hating it."

"raymond-15","9","3","6","20 May 2002"," Kubrick masterpiece
","As relevant today as when the film was made 30 years ago, Kubrick's film has become a classic. I include it in my best ten. With keen penetrating vision Kubrick has given us a slice of life as it was....and still is. Let's face it....what has changed? Rampant youths stealing cars, breaking into homes, daubing walls with grafitti, overdosing on drugs, bashing the elderly, involving themselves in murder, rape and terrorism.  What a prophetic film! And how magnificently does Andrew McDowell portray the character of Alex Delarge (under Kubrick's expert direction).  This actor was at the right place at the right time and Kubrick seized the opportunity.  McDowell has never done better than his role in ""A Clockwork Orange"".<br/><br/>The various brutal acts performed by Alex and his gang have been amply described by other reviewers.  They are scenes not easily forgotten, and the hatred, disgust and loathing captured in Alex's expression is a credit to his acting ability.<br/><br/>Alex's so-called rehabilitation was an interesting part of the film. While ""aversion therapy"" is not so much in use to-day because of the introduction of new medications, to have one's neck clamped and eyelids pinned back is an unenviable position to be in and actual torture for Alex. The subsequent testing of the success of the treatment by exposing a naked woman in close proximity to Alex in front of the assessing medical fraternity seemed to me to be primitive to an extreme, but it made good cinema.<br/><br/>The media report on Alex's attempted suicide with its political ramifications brought a new sense of power to Alex. As the Government Minister pandered to his every need, even feeding him with a fork. (I laughed outright at this point. It was such a humourous situation).<br/><br/>The film does not state what happens to Alex.  It gives us little hope.<br/><br/>The best that can be said is that Kubrick thrusts the facts directly at us and just as in the """"aversion therapy"" we cannot turn away. This film has such a strong message. What has happened in these intervening years....what have we accomplished to put things right? Sad to say....nothing!"

","It disturbs me that a lot of these 10/10 reviews rave on about the ""ultraviolence"" and sex.  Now I do not have a problem with art - I have no problem with realistic portrayal either - but to extol the art of a film because it is violent or has sexual content, debases the people who do so into carnal savages.<br/><br/>Is it so wrong that in the 21st Century, with all the misery and destruction, that we learn to elevate our culture and society to have some self-respect and compassion?  Evidently when someone gleefully watches ""A Clockwork Orange"" delving delightfully in its violence, that being a better person isn't a virtue worth striving for for that person.<br/><br/>On to the movie review: Malcolm McDowell plays one of the most hateable characters I've ever watched - and one can only naturally congratulate Malcolm for his acting talent.  However, the rest of the film is only average.  Perhaps in the 70s it may have been brilliant for the cinematography but I find the themes very basic.  There's certainly nothing extraordinary about this film at all.  Stories like ""1984"" or ""Metropolis"" would be considered brilliant in conception and vision, but ""A Clockwork Orange"" has nary a thought that would cause one to pause more than a second of afterthought.  The concept of removing one's free will to do evil was very poorly conveyed and it never once caused me to ponder it.<br/><br/>I just get this feeling that there is really nothing great about this film at all, and so all these animalistic fans of violence-for-the-sake-of-violence make up all these so-called qualities for this film just to pad their reviews so it's not so obvious how so lacking in substance this film really is.  A film like ""Brazil"" for instance, covers the themes of ""A Clockwork Orange"" so brilliantly that one thinks about how it relates to society.  ""A Clockwork Orange"" does nothing to relate to the real world since it poorly relates anything except for some brute violence.

"Michael_Elliott","Null","4","10","30 August 2010"," Incredible Vision of Future Ultra-Violence
","Clockwork Orange, A (1971) <br/><br/>**** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Set at some point in the future, British teen Alex DeLarge (Malcolm McDowell) spends most of his time hanging with his goon friends, raping women and causing other violent harm but after he's caught he volunteers for an experimental therapy that doesn't quite work as planned. Sick, shocking, crude, violent, nauseating and vulgar are just a few of the words that many will use when describing this film but I'd call it a true piece of art that rightfully deserves its high reputation. Many people have said that a Kubrick film would never be a Kubrick film if it wasn't an ego-maniac you took his sweet time to make sure what made it to the screen was his vision and only his vision. There's something beautiful about a painter taking his time to make sure his painting has all the right colors and vibes yet if a filmmaker does this he's often criticized for it. There's no doubt in my mind that Kubrick was a mad genius and that's never more evident in this adaptation of the Anthony Burgess novel. To me the greatest thing about this movie is its sick and twisted sense of humor but also the visual look of the film. It's amazing what Kubrick can do in the matter of seconds but the masterful and now legendary opening sequence only lasts a few seconds yet it pulls you into this bizarre world of sex and murder. These two objects are never a funny thing yet Kubrick pulls us into this world where we can laugh at them and follow our ""hero"" Alex as he rapes one person after another, murders and fights only for us to eventually come to see him as the good guy and a victim. I'm sure one could make this film a very political one and many arguments have been raged about the meaning of the ending but everyone who watches the film will draw something different from it and I'm sure ones own opinion on what's done to our hero will have you seeing the ending in different ways. For me personally, the film has always been an incredibly dark comedy that works simply because the world we're watching might be set in the future but you could call it ahead of its time just like METROPOLIS was. It takes place in the future with the bizarre sets and weird culture yet at the same time the subject matter is so today that you can't help but feel you're in the middle of some nightmare. McDowell's performance is a truly great one as he perfectly plays both the psychotic Alex but also the victim. I thought some of McDowell's greatest work here comes once he's cured and can no longer tolerate violence. What's even better is the narration, which is downright superb and wonderfully used by the director with the actor perfectly delivering the lines and helping one get into the story. You'll also never hear ""Singin' in the Rain"" the same way again. Some people call the film overindulgent, which is probably is but I see this as a good thing. This just helps create this strange world and in the end it's really unlike any movie ever made and there's just something so unique in its vision that you can't help but feel this is something from the future. Kubrick's vision has never been questioned and fans could debate on which of his features has the greatest look but for my money it's this film. That's not to say this is the director's greatest film but I do think it has the great look and feel. It's certainly a very violent movie but the director gives the violence such a pleasant nature that it just seems normal and rather light. The strange music selection, crazy camera shots and overall strange tone makes it a one of a kind and that's why A CLOCKWORK ORANGE will always be a timeless work of art."

I love the language of the book and I think the topics that Burgess is trying to address are interesting.<br/><br/>When I heard there was a movie of the book, I thought I should go see it. Kubric forgot one very essential thing to the movie that just turns it into a movie about a hoodlum. We never get to peer into Alex's head-space. Without being able to ""see"" the world as Alex see's the world, we miss the real points of the story. Alex doesn't get to grow, and he never becomes a person that one can empathize with. We also miss the arguments about whether or not society has the right to fundamentally alter a person. Kubric has inflicted a monumental disservice to this book."
"DhavalVyas","4","4","10","25 October 2005"," I did not like the main character.
","One of the most enjoyable aspects of a movie are its characters. The characters of a movie bring joy and life to a film. Many characters in movies have become household names in the United States; Luke Skywalker, Don Corleone, Michael Myers, etc, etc. One of the main things I did not like about 'A Clockwork Orange' was its main character, and that was what ruined the movie. In fact, I think this movie did not have any likable characters, which makes it even harder to watch.<br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick's 'A Clockwork Orange' has become a cult-classic. I remember in high school, this film was very well known and liked by a lot of people. At the same time, I realized that it was liked because of how grotesque and violent the story was, and not famous for the messages it was trying to convey. The film is based on a book with the same name by Anthony Burgess. I think both the book and movie are vastly overrated. The book was slightly better than the movie, but it still did not impress me that much.<br/><br/>One of the main problems with the story is that we have so sympathize with a rapist and a murderer. This is hard to do regardless of what punishments he receives. The basic problem is that we have to feel sorry for a character whose main solutions in solving problems is through violent means. Sorry, I cannot like somebody like that regardless if his free will is taken away. Let me ask a question to those people who are in favor of this film. Would you still be adulation of Kubrick's overrated movie if it had starred somebody similar to Jeffry Dahmer, Adolf Hitler, or any other real-life killer? Think about it and let me know the answer."
"technical85","1","5","14","3 May 2015"," Traumatic experience
","Anybody who idolizing Alex in someway or other being incapable to put themselves in the position of the raped and crippled writer's family or murdered ""cat lady"" is enough to showcase ""the cruel reality"" of our world we live in (some ""message"" that these cocky reviewers are deciphering out from the movie itself). If anything this extravaganza of horrific violence and immorality accomplishes is to shedding the light on the fact that people can enjoy them when it is shaped in a form of ""art"" or ""entertainment"" or ""film"" decorated with glorious scores. <br/><br/>The fact that movie naturally allows Alex to get away with all the social harm and damage he had inflicted, not only with paying less price for ending too many innocent lives but even being rewarded good job with good pay at the end, not to mention by getting back to his monstrous corrupted personality is illustrating the sickness of our society. Audience who are marginalizing the significance of the crimes committed by Alex and his crew are reinforcing them. If there is anything ""satirical"" and ""sarcastic"", ironically, this would be the core. <br/><br/>Not only suffers from explicit violence, weak character development and dull background settings, this movie also does abysmal job to convey the original message director was attempting to deliver. What are the problems of this ""future"" society that persuade youth gangs into ultra-violence in the first place? If free-will is a mean to drive youths into rape and murder, why aren't we focused to curing of the social sickness that let evil prevails over good? When Preacher is trying to protect Alex from psychological experiment by shouting ""goodness must come from within"", isn't it ironic that real Alex, Alex before penitentiary and after the ending, would've enjoyed killing and raping more than anybody else? I understand antagonist of this movie should be the government who, while incapable to medicate this sickness, trying to overcome the disorder with tyrannical approach. But this narrative in mind will leave you bad taste after seeing the ending which implicates government prevailed over the intellectual who apparently tried to use Alex as leftist political ideology. The only funny thing in this movie is anything evil ends up happy with keeping his privilege.<br/><br/>Last but never least I dare you to say this movie will cause unintended lasting effect among ill-informed audience and it will continue forever. After watching that traumatic raping scene, I was sure that this movie is going to affect spoiled youths and potential psychopaths in one way or another - took a look at wikipedia, and boom, it was right. Let me make a quick quote: ""In March 1972, during the trial of a fourteen-year- old male accused of the manslaughter of a classmate, the prosecutor referred to A Clockwork Orange, suggesting that the film had a macabre relevance to the case. The film was also linked to the murder of an elderly vagrant by a 16-year-old boy in Bletchley, Buckinghamshire, who pleaded guilty after telling police that friends had told him of the film ""and the beating up of an old boy like this one."""" It's also disgusting enough that some audience even marginalize the significance of violence and crime committed by Alex."

","I've never been a big fan of this movie. I'm indifferent to the violence which I find unconvincing and comical. Instead I find the movie to be so ridiculously streamlined that for all it's outrageousness, just ends up feeling like a children's story, underscoring its moral over and over. Kubrick has reduced the whole production to a schematic argument with no real detail. There's just nothing else to consider in the movie except a singular, remedial idea about free will. Two hours and 16 minutes is way too much time to be this ideoogically barren. The first part proceeds rapidly enough, but the obvious developments after the Ludovico treatment drag unmercifully. How could Kubrick make 2001, which is teeming with ideas, and then go on to make this?<br/><br/>Its provocations are way over the top as unrefined minds prefer. Patrick McGeehan's grotesque hamming is the most unsubtle thing in a very unsubtle movie. I suspect guys talk themselves into this being a masterpiece in their horny, rebellious teens, then spend the rest of their lives never thinking about it again; continuing to defend their initial position and premature rave. There's nothing going on in this movie. it's like watching a juggler with one ball. Kubrick further undermines his art and the shock of the violence by getting too much titillation out of it; his rape victims are always attractive women with supermodel figures and enormous, spherical breasts. How many nitwits would be raving about this movie is even one of the chicks was out of shape?"

","A Clockwork Orange is a 1971 dystopian crime film adapted, produced, and directed by Stanley Kubrick, based on Anthony Burgess's 1962 novel A Clockwork Orange. It employs disturbing, violent images to comment on psychiatry, juvenile delinquency, youth gangs, and other social, political, and economic subjects in a dystopian near-future Britain.<br/><br/>Alex (Malcolm McDowell), the main character, is a charismatic, sociopathic delinquent whose interests include classical music (especially Beethoven), rape, and what is termed ""ultra-violence."" He leads a small gang of thugs (Pete, Georgie, and Dim), whom he calls his droogs (from the Russian word ""friend,"" ""buddy""). The film chronicles the horrific crime spree of his gang, his capture, and attempted rehabilitation via controversial psychological conditioning. Alex narrates most of the film in Nadsat, a fractured adolescent slang composed of Slavic (especially Russian), English, and Cockney rhyming slang.<br/><br/>The soundtrack to A Clockwork Orange features mostly classical music selections and Moog synthesizer compositions by Wendy Carlos (then known as Walter Carlos). The artwork of the now-iconic poster of A Clockwork Orange was created by Philip Castle with the layout by designer Bill Gold."

","In regards to 1971's ""A Clockwork Orange"" - When I seriously consider Kubrick's previous movie-project (the triumphant, outer space, extravaganza - 2001: A Space Odyssey), I can't help but scratch my head and wonder what the heck prompted said film-maker to take such a violent U-Turn as he did with this film.<br/><br/>With ""A Clockwork Orange"", Kubrick clearly offered the viewer a motion picture of very questionable entertainment value. Here we are handed a truly demented tale that gleefully showcased white-trash, juvenile delinquency at its most vicious, vile and corruptible.<br/><br/>If ""A Clockwork Orange"" was meant to be some sort of a twisted & perverse moral lesson, then it clearly missed its mark. If it was meant to be viewed as a scathing social commentary, then its message definitely told me that (as a society of human beings) we are, indeed, utterly and hopelessly doomed.<br/><br/>I certainly found it very difficult to look upon this film's hypocritical stance, as well as its hatefulness and its brutality, as being really worthwhile entertainment. <br/><br/>Considered one of the absolute, most controversial films of the 1970s - You can be sure that even today, 43 years later, ""A Clockwork Orange"" still remains something of a bona-fide shocker.<br/><br/>I certainly can't imagine anyone (in their right mind, of course) ever wanting to watch ""A Clockwork Orange"" more than once. But, hey, with that said - Isn't one man's pain (sometimes) another man's pleasure?"
"Seraphion","7","3","7","4 October 2014"," The best Kubrick work I've seen so far
","The movie goes on strong in all of its scenes and sequences. From the quirky and mysterious opening, to the utterly crazy first chapter of the story, to the explicit depiction of forced brainwashing, to the 'full circle' final chapter and the conspiracy theory ending. The movie is a great work for me because it can make me feel two different types of attitude towards Alex. At first I was utterly disgusted by what he and his gang do in their spare time on the first chapter. But then when the 'full circle' revenge is exacted by the cripple, I was kind of sorry for him to have endured such atrocities. But then the feeling return back to normal when the conversation with the psychiatrist happens. The acting is okay in overall. It's shows just he kind of standard Stanley Kubrick work which also sometimes allow a bit of hyperbolic over-acting here and there."

","I have read many comments here about the movie being disturbing or offensive but believe me, that is not true. This film is a stunning visual experience. As with most of the Kubrick films attention to detail is quite apparent here. From the costumes to the sets to the music to the acting, everything is just perfect. I need not say anything more.<br/><br/>As regards to the films relevance today, I would like to say that films like these are ageless. They will always be relevant. The central premise of the film questions whether it is correct to suppress the free spirit of an individual, even to do wrong, for the greater good of the society. I think that this premise remains as significant today as it was 100 years ago and would be, a 1000 years from now.<br/><br/>I had always thought that 2001 was Kubrick's masterpiece, but that was until I saw A Clockwork Orange. I can only now sit back and marvel at the genius that was Stanley Kubrick. I just wish we had more filmmakers like him today.<br/><br/>Highly recommended to everyone. 10/10."

","A Clockwork Orange is, to put it simply, one of the scariest movies ever made. I know a lot of people like Dr. Strangelove, but I must say this is one of the best films ever made.<br/><br/>Malcom McDowell gives an Oscar-gypt'd performance as Alex de Large who, with his droogs, go out, rape, beat, and kill many people. When, Alex finds his droogs making plans about robbing a dairy behind his back, he feels threatened but go along with their plan. Then he attacks his droogs as they walk down a pier, saying that the sound of Beethoven from a passing car inspired his violence. We see them in a restaurant and Alex once again brings up the dairy robbery plan. At the dairy they try to convince the rich lady at the dairy to let her in but she gets suspicious and calls the police. When the cops arrive, Alex's droogs betray him, knock him out, and run. To shorten his sentence Alex agrees to ""aversion therapy"" which seems to change him, or does it? Rounding out the cast are Patrick Magee, Michael Bates, Warren Clarke, and John Clive.<br/><br/>I wish I could give this film a 6 out of 5 just for a revolutionary, directorial look, where Kubrick has many bad scenes accompanied by jolly music; where if we are to experience them as we should, we have to do it consciously, by realizing they are bad, and not because the director tells us so through the use of music and images. Just a terrific movie."
"EvilSpaceApple","5","3","7","14 February 2006"," Appreciated for many of the wrong reasons
","In light of the disturbing number of invective-laced replies, over on the discussion boards, to any post that DARES to criticize any aspect of this film, this seems to me the preferable forum in which to offer a handful of personal observations based on my somewhat less than positive response to Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of Anthony Burgess's ""A Clockwork Orange"", a film I believe enjoys a gratuitously inflated reputation; a film of some value, but not the masterpiece so many have hailed it as.<br/><br/>Kubrick sticks to the source novel rather closely here. Except when it suits him, of course. Specific instances of alterations, additions, and subtractions have been oft-cited, so I'll forbear to enumerate them here. My point is that such changes as he saw fit to effect, seem to me decidedly NOT improvements upon Burgess, though Kubrick may have felt some of them were, rather than simply ways to avoid censorship. It seems likely some were made to allow for greater audience sympathy with Alex (and less for his victims); Lord knows an audience can sympathize with a guy who rapes women and kicks winos--but not one who runs over ""odd squealing things"" the way--in the book, but not in the movie-- Alex and his droogs do on their mad midnight joyride. <br/><br/>The film is uneven, and that, if nothing else, should give people a problem. To me, the script breaks down, roughly, into five acts... ACT I: From the opening, chilling shot of Alex and droogs in the milk bar, through the killing of the Cat Lady, this is the longest and easily the most impressively sustained 'act'. Here, Kubrick keeps things moving and consistently entertaining, through use of camera placement/angles, editing, music choices which--though not necessarily as clever or apt as some have claimed--are good and lively, sets, etc. Not to mention the fearless performance of Malcolm McDowell as Alex. I dislike the sped-up orgy sequence (which reminds me overmuch of ""Gilligan's Island""-type slapstick)--indeed much of the humor makes me wince, not smile (think Mrs. DeLarge's false teeth)--but nevertheless it's the first 45 minutes that make the film at all interesting for me. I believe it IS, contrary to many people's defensive protests, a kind of celebration of Alex's demonic energy--a perverse paean, if you will, to his hedonistic and ultra-violent instincts.<br/><br/>It's later, when Kubrick must deal with the violence done TO Alex--his ""treatment"" and later comeuppance at the hands of former victims--that I find the film bogs down, and never quite recovers. ACT II: Some of the prison scenes (courtyard, library especially) have an almost perfunctory feel; and the scenes back in (ACT IV) Alex's home and the writer's house seem drawn out as if to pad the running time, which was hardly necessary. (And Patrick Magee's excessively histrionic display during his later scenes scarcely helps matters, to my mind.) <br/><br/>In between, the crucial ACT III, consisting of the Ludovico treatment and demonstration scene, I find comes close to realizing what Burgess probably had in mind, and to Act I in terms of sheer cinematic power. I've concluded that Kubrick's decision to leave most of what's on screen during the treatment to our imagination, allowing MM's marvelously expressive facial performance (and impressive screams of terror) to fill the blanks in for us, was indeed correct. During the demonstration scene following, I find some of the spectators' reactions too broadly played, but subtlety cannot have been what the director was after here (or anywhere else, for that matter).<br/><br/>***SPOILERS AHEAD***<br/><br/>That leaves ACT V, commencing with Alex's recovery in hospital from his near-fatal plunge, and concluding with the strange final image of the ""cured"" Alex, once again enjoying erotic visions to Ludwig van. I'm NOT going to take Kubrick to task for not filming a chapter he didn't even know existed; I'm of two minds myself as to Burgess's decision to include it. What I WILL take issue with is changing the way Alex envisions his being cured. In the film, he's copulating with a stacked female to upper-class onlookers' applause; in the novel, a more violent picture takes form in Alex's mind, ""carving the whole litso of the creeching world with my cutthroat britva."" I doubt that even Kubrick could have brought himself to film as black an ending as THAT, and risk jeopardizing the sympathy for Alex he'd been careful to build up during the last hour. So much, I guess, for the vaunted boldness and uncomprisingness of his vision.<br/><br/>The Ape's verdict: ""A Clockwork Orange"" is more fruitfully viewed and appreciated as something closer to the ""pop art fresco"" it's been labeled (or to elevated exploitation piece, for that matter) than to social commentary, philosophical treatise, or art cinema. (In a parallel instance, ""The Shining""--to my mind SK's arguable masterpiece--gains when considered as a lavishly mounted, epic-scale take on the traditional tale-told-around-the-campfire, rather than as a study in isolation and insanity.) By ascribing all means of social, moral, and political relevance to Alex's treatment at the hands of the State during the film's second half (wherein the film's purported themes ostensibly lie), many of its ardent fans have done a disservice to Kubrick's most interesting and notable achievementthe juggling act he performs with our emotional responses to on-screen violence during the first act, his daring to seem to celebrate acts that our upbringings and our consciences tell us we must find reprehensiblea disservice from which the film's inflated reputation may not, ironically, recover. Such a fate tends to befall films appreciated for the wrong reasons, and ""Orange"", I fear, will be no exception. <br/><br/>I would hope my comments might constitute a very small step in another direction. But I doubt it."

"fineanimal","5","3","7","29 September 2002"," Good story, lousy film
","A Clockwork Orange has achieved legendary status, but for the life of me I cannot figure out why. The original story by Anthony Burgess strives to make an important Orwellian statement about the perils of allowing society to override peoples' free will for the common good. But the production of this film is so irretrievably dated and incoherent that the moral is almost entirely lost in a bizarre mix of stylish ultraviolence and unrefined cheese. Take Stanley Kubrick's name off the credits and its almost a certainty that the gang at Mystery Science Theater would have had a field day with this overrated dud.<br/><br/>Granted, the nudity, sex and violence must have been shocking in 1971, and shock can make a point. These scenes are commonplace today, however, and there lies the main reason that this film seems forever trapped in 1971: it relies entirely on shock value to make its point, yet the scenes in this film are no longer shocking. In too many ways, they are disturbingly silly.<br/><br/>For all the talk about Kubrick's ""brilliant"" ironic juxtaposition of beautiful classical music against the ugliness of violence, most of the soundtrack sounds like it was created by an escapee from the primate sanctuary who entered the sound studios of Leonard Nimoy's ""In Search Of..."" and began pounding away at the Mini-Moog.<br/><br/>Unlike Kubrick's timeless masterpiece, Dr. Strangelove, A Clockwork Orange looks like it was already seriously dated by the end of the year it was released, even though the story apparently takes place well in the future. So much bad hair, pre-disco costuming and overtly sexual ""modern"" art makes one think of Andy Warhol far more than George Orwell, adding a buffoonish quality to what should have been a serious story.<br/><br/>And unless Kubrick expected that Americans would never see this film, one has to wonder why the speech almost entirely consists of slurred, sloppy British slang to the point where one requires English subtitles to get anywhere beyond the gist of what is being said in this English-speaking film.<br/><br/>My apologies to those who love A Clockwork Orange, but it really isn't a very good film. It's sad enough when art achieves immortality through style rather than substance. But when even the cheesy style upon which a work of art's immortality is based has long since become a historical embarrassment, we have to start looking for psychological reasons why this film remains so popular."

","Ok so people think of this as a bit of classic movie making; it might well be in some respects but that doesn't stop it from being dull to watch.  I saw it at the cinema not so long ago when it was doing its re-release revival and it looked very dated and I found it kinda lame to be honest. It wasn't at all shocking, more boring than shocking.<br/><br/>Yeh so he wore eye liner and jumped around a lot like a 5 year old, and liked to be violent, so what?  Anthony Burgess created a silly language to go with the movie - so what?  Its just stupid talk like Teletubbie talk - it has no intrinsic value and doesn't enlighten us in any way about anything.<br/><br/>People who loved this movie I think have missed the point about what good movie making is all about.<br/><br/>Kubrick was certainly a talented director and The Shining, Lolita, Spartacus and 2001: A Space Odyssey are classics of the genre but ""A Clockwork Orange"" is a very flawed and silly movie."

","OK, let me start by saying I ""get it"". The film draws us to hate the protagonist so much that we as audience members actually start thinking violent thoughts and wanting to beat him up. So we become like him. There are indeed some interesting themes in the film, and it's quite intellectual.<br/><br/>Except it didn't work in my case -- I was just sickened. I spotted the trap and didn't end up wanting to beat up and dismember the protagonist. So much pathological violence. So much misery.<br/><br/>It's weird, because I'm an action movie buff. I like it when stuff blows up, but I'm talking about cartoony action like Jackie Chan or Arnold Schwarzenegger. In this film, the pain was very real and inescapable.<br/><br/>I think if you're a film school type with an appreciation for the acting, the cinematography, the deep themes, maybe you could ignore the violence. No, you really couldn't. I'd be a little disturbed by anyone who said that straight out. I guess everyone who likes this film must like it despite the violence? Even ""Reservoir Dogs"" wasn't this bad (gorey, but the characters didn't revel in the pain).<br/><br/>I get it, but highly recommend against it.<br/><br/>Who should see this film:<br/><br/>-- arty types with a healthy (unhealthy?) resistance to violence<br/><br/>and nightmares<br/><br/>Kubrick often set out to create controversial films.

The film doesn't attempt to solve the sometimes confounding cinematic connection between (and the curious lure of) violence and sex--and I'm not a big fan of the queasy mixed with the satirically sensational--yet after a few reels of this stuff, you're ready for Kubrick to change gears (and, in the third act, he does).

","A Clockwork Orange was always a film I wanted to watch but it was one of these films that I was too young to watch when it was initially released in British cinemas and then banned by Director Stanley Kubrick from being available in Britain. The ban remained until he died.<br/><br/>The film became infamous for its depiction of violence and sex. It overlooked the fact that despite its initial scenes of brutality and rape, in its heart it is a dark comedy set in a futuristic Dystopian Britain.<br/><br/>An adaptation of Anthony Burgess novel, Malcolm McDowell might be a shade too old to play the teenage delinquent Alex getting high on milk-plus which is infused with drugs and then partakes in an orgy of ultra-violence which includes beating up a vagrant, fighting with a rival gang and then speeding through the country roads where they burst into the house of a writer who gets beaten up and watches his wife get raped as Alex sings Singin in the rain.<br/><br/>We know Alex is still at school as he lives in his parents flat and is visited the next morning by his probation officer who is concerned about his absence from school.<br/><br/>However Alex's luck runs out. He falls out with his fellow gang members and when he breaks into another house, he kills a woman with a phallic sculpture, betrayed by his gang and caught by the police, he is sentenced to 14 years in jail.<br/><br/>The opening part of the film would had been deemed shocking in early 1970s Britain. I doubt that level of sex and savagery would had ever been seen before in a mainstream British film.<br/><br/>However the film becomes more of a surreal prison film once Alex ends up in jail where he joins a church group and tries to fend off advances from fellow inmates. A visiting government minister offers him a chance to take part in an experiment. Once he undertakes an experimental aversion therapy for rehabilitating criminals within two weeks the film becomes a black revenge comedy.<br/><br/>Once freed from prison and rehabilitated Alex finds there is no room for him in his parents home, he gets set upon by a gang of vagrants as the tramp who he beat up in the beginning recognises Alex. His old gang members are now in the police and they torture him. Worse still he stumbles into the house of the writer who he attacked and he gets his vengeance as well. Poor Alex now cannot listen to his favourite piece of Beethoven without doing harm to himself.<br/><br/>There is an underlying political satire of a government wanting to tackle violence in society by being draconian themselves until public opinion turns against them.<br/><br/>The film contains a lot of slang derived from east European languages and although I mentioned he looked rather old to play the teenage Alex, Malcolm McDowell delivers an amazing performance providing a narrative with his Yorkshire tones.<br/><br/>The film might put off some of its audience with its disturbing opening but settles in well after that."

","One of Stanley Kubrick's best. Alex DeLarge is my favorite character in cinematic history. The film takes such an ugly idea of a young man and he's goons spending their free time drinking drug filled milk, beating up homeless men and breaking into peoples house and doing some very ungentlemanly acts; and then still not being able to get to school the next day. That idea is then filled with some amazing cinematography, brilliant music, dark humor and an unconventionally likable main character that it becomes a masterpiece. Also the way they speak in just awesome. It is a serious mind-flip of a film but I love it and if you are fan of strange films, you should definitely check this one out."

","In an onslaught of ultra-violence, including rape and murder, Alexander DeLarge (Malcolm McDowell) is finally caught and ""cured"" by his authoritarian government. <br/><br/>It took Stanley Kubrick for a movie like A Clockwork Orange to be done right, and help film openly evolve through the years like it did. It took his classical music, and his bitingly humorous, bleak visual representation, for general audiences to even consider the content. <br/><br/>Kubrick's genius in A Clockwork Orange lies in his willingness to throw everything that few prefer to talk about onto the screen. A Clockwork Orange is disgusting, but wonderfully so. It lifts the cover on the dark part of human nature that people tend to sweep under the rug every day of the week. If ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" largely displays the beauty and wonder of human existence, then A Clockwork Orange is its counterpart. It shows what humanity seems to be unable to accept about themselves, and it is a domineering part of life on Earth. Clockwork reached across the screen and dared me, begged me to admit and see the darkness within me and around me. This his how self- understanding and acceptance can flourish. If not, those evil impulses will not only exist but operate. A Clockwork Orange is an exercise in human horror, and displays an insanely large part of my existence."

","The film is set in a dystopian, futuristic London, where the youth is getting themselves involved in the most extreme of crimes. Kubrick gives us a harsh portrayal of the current face of our society, one of the primary reasons the movie wasn't taken well initially, but has now become a cult phenomenon. It connects this portrayal to a cruel glimpse into an Orwellian totalitarian government, which combats this same infection of crime with a brutal, gut-wrenching psychological treatments. The viewer is left struggling with his notions of morality, and free will. But that is Kubrick's style isn't it? <br/><br/>Alex, a Beethoven-loving, sociopathic and conscienceless thug, roams around with his 'droogs', raping, looting, committing all sorts of heinous crimes, with not so much as a finger pointed at them. His buoyant, aloof, almost arrogant self-narration gives us a dark glimpse into the mind of misguided youth in our society, who associate glory with these acts. However, in a home-looting sequence, he is betrayed by his friends owing to their discontent with his authoritarian rule, who hand him over to the police. The Ministry of the Interior, for me, a reference to the Thought Police in 1984, introduce their horrifying technique for ""curing"" criminals.<br/><br/>The description of the treatment would make your jaw drop. It is a grim reminder of what the power of behavioral and psychological modification in the hands of wrong people can do. Alex is turned into a Clockwork Orange, and the questions start to pour in...<br/><br/>The film is a running lecture on free will, along with a warning regarding the psychological techniques that the government can impose. Its central premise is to ask the viewer - What is the definition of goodness? Can aversion therapy really stop immoral behavior? Do we have the right to infringe upon someone's free will? Can we allow our police to impose this brutality upon us, in order to solve crime? <br/><br/>It is a simply stellar take on the complexities of our mind, challenging our very definitions of goodness and morality.

","What kind of movie is this? A drama about life? A film about the life of crime? A Sci-Fi? A film about or against violence? Well, maybe everything I just said and more! The story is about Alex ""DeLarge"" (Malcolm McDowell), a young teenager, music lover of Beethoven, who lives a life of what he calls ""ultra-violence"". He and his small group of criminals terrorize London night with all imaginable kinds of crimes, from rape to assaulting houses and beating up on thugs. After all ""the fun"" Alex returns home and pretends to be the boy behaved that works to help people during the night. When he's line of crime reaches a point where he is arrested and sentenced to 14 years in prison.<br/><br/>2 years of knocks and suspensions, Alex hears about a program that could take him out of prison soon. Little does he know that this will take him to an even worse situation.<br/><br/>Interesting story does in it? Despite the fact it took years until his debut and premiered when he was attacked viciously by critics. Well, let's continue with the review of this masterpiece.<br/><br/>Kubrick manages to make a film in a breathtaking by every minute that passes. The film is narrated in an exploitative and satirical language, even the dialogs between the characters can have a language satirical and exploitative, Alex is a great proof of that. Each of his words to the group and all other characters is all Shakespearean, we watch the film as if we be reading a dark and gloomy poem (like Alex himself). But every moment Kubrick doesn't resist putting the little British dark humor, letting the film be it pure entertainment at some point.<br/><br/>The disturbing scenes that plague the film (which are many, no spoilers) are filmed in a even disturbing way. The use of image and cinematography that Kubrick's use is disturbing as fascinating, framing in an impressive way.<br/><br/>A mixture of themes that Kubrick uses in the film is also a point to be brilliant. The use of drama in the story of Alex, while a hint of dark humor. Alex's vision of the world as a violent place where violence is to be made. And while it can have a cultured and intellectual mind with books and classical music.<br/><br/>The time when Alex is arrested and have entered the small program where he is just a guinea pig, for much less than he knows what it is, it will totally change his life and his mind, with that Kubrick's make's a entry of sci-fi so impressively. Then with the return of Alex to the world now as a completely changed man, suffering, tragedy and drama again re-enters in the film, and criticizes the society (even unpredictable in the film) and for the first time we start feeling sorry for Alex's character.<br/><br/>The performances are all excellent, Malcolm McDowell gives a fantastic performance in all details, their eyes and their expressions get's better by every passing minute.<br/><br/>A true masterpiece that manages to be so disturbing and interesting to watch. Move both mentally and exciting journey and when we watch the transformation of Alex and his world around. With a superb directing and writing and fantastic performances, ""A Clockwork Orange"" is truly a masterpiece of centuries with total recommendation from my humble part."
"Rodrigo_Amaro","10","2","4","9 May 2011"," One Of The Most Dangerous Films Ever Made
","All of this can be said of ""A Clockwork Orange"": controversial in all possible ways, shocking, jaw dropping, wild yet beautiful, artistic, elucidative, cinematically impressive, unique. Stanley Kubrick reveals the world as it is, horrible things we do not want to see melded with a disturbing sense of humor. Here's an striking film that dares us to watch, disturb our senses and perceptions, and in the end most of us we'll be failing in seeing what one of the greatest directors of all time tried to say to us about a violent futuristic society that reflect many problems of all the forms of societies in all the times, past, present and future. <br/><br/>It is a dangerous film because it challenges its viewers to open their eyes to violent acts presented in a almost jolly, pleasurable way (of course, the ones who are committing acts like beating a old man and raping his wife to the sound of 'Singin' in the Rain') and most people will probably think Kubrick is a sadistic man for filming such things. Not the case! Here's a director aware of its time, who probably saw how things were running down in the world like extreme violence, bad politics, totalitarianism, moral failure of society and decided to make his own statement on the issue (not only he, in fact, this is based on Anthony Burgess book). We see this ultraviolence in the film as a distant future but now, many years later, things haven't changed much and there'll always some twaddler out there to blame amoral behavior in society because of films like these which leads me to another aspect of why this is a really dangerous film. <br/><br/>It is the most misinterpreted film of all time, hailed by the wrong reasons (and most of the time by the wrong kind of viewers, the ones who love Alex mannerisms and violence), and the wrong kinds of ideologies who are led to believe Alex is a hero, the government is the oppressive system that institues wrong forms of rehabilitation and all. I can't be a hypocrite, I also got the wrong idea of what this film is about several times, always believing that this was some sort of morality tale about not doing to others what you wouldn't wish was done to you. It's way more than this.<br/><br/>The paradox is amazing since we have the most dubious character ever created on film, greatly played by Malcolm McDowell. You can hate Alex DeLarge, you can like him and you might have mixed feelings about his way of seeing the world, using complicated expressions to express himself or express violence, hatred, and we also have the ""corrected"" Alex, the one sent to a drug experiment where he started to hate everything he liked in his previous rebel life: violence, sex crimes, and he can't even listen to Beethoven anymore without feeling sick. <br/><br/>Some films have not the obligation to answer our questions or to lead us into some one path or the other; they're exist to be watched, to be debated, to make us think about new perspectives on a provoking and controversial theme. ""A Clockwork Orange"" is a mandatory film for those who dare to see how powerful movies are and how cinema is powerful, visceral, contradictory, an wonderful media at its highest best status: being art and a deep look into a reality, much more than just entertainment. Love it or hate it but it's a real Horrorshow! 10/10"

","Saw it about a week ago. Heard about it from a colleague who told me he almost wet himself from the get go. So I just bought it and saw it. First of I'd like to say it was a pretty good movie with an original idea considering when it was made. The movie is about a teenager whose soul passions are Beethoven and ""Ultra violence"". The movie starts off with Alex the main character and his companions in a milk bar. The movie can be divided in 3 parts from this point on. The first part, we are presented with the mischief that Alex and his gang do, like raping a woman and beating up her husband, getting in a gang fight and other nasty stuff. Because of some arguments Alex had with his gang members he got left at a crime scene so the Cops caught him. At this point we proceed with the second part, in which Alex is imprisoned and starts reassessing his life up to this moment. He behaves well and thus is recruited sort of speak for a new experiment that is meant to stop violent behavior. After the terrifying experiment (which involves showing violent images while playing Beethoven's fifth) Alex is unable to commit any violence acts so as a result he is released on parole. This marks the beginning of the third part. After being released Alex returns to his home where he soon learns that things change. He's parents rented out his room, the people who were abused by him get their revenge, and so on and so forth. The last person that gets its revenge is the man whose wife he killed and left him a cripple. The man locks him in a room and plays only Beethoven's fifth symphony which leads to Alex's meltdown and he's attempted suicide. The end of the movie like in all my other revisions I won't give away, you'll have to see it for yourself. So in the end just to summarize ""Clockwork Orange"" is a brilliantly thought out movie about violence, which everyone should see at least once in their life."

","When I was told to watch this film for the first time I wasn't really interested in it at all. Upon watching the movie and seeing the credits I realised that i had taken for granted possibly one of the most beautiful and timeless films that iv'e seen for a while. A Clockwork Orange should be considered one of the must watch films of the past 50 years.<br/><br/>The actual story is one that tries to teach a lesson. That lesson being that you cant control people, as it causes more bad than good. This idea is put well in the book, but after watching the film I was left with an idea of empty purpose. If your looking for an emotional film then this is it, but certainly not a film that teaches any strong messages.<br/><br/>The acting in the film is superb and Malcolm McDowl truly pulls of the character of Alex, making the film that much better. You will laugh, you will feel pity and you will feel angry. All at the same time with him pulling off the cheeky character of Alex that's telling a story of a young criminals journey of madness .<br/><br/>Another notable performance is that of Michael Bates, Whose role as the prison Capitan brings in a quirky and comedic feeling in a somewhat dim setting.<br/><br/>For me personally the use of music in this film is what helps bring it a notch above the rest. Its classical music approach is perfect for the film and suits the settings and characters better than any other film does. My favorite being ""The Funeral of Queen Mary"", by Wendy Carlos which epitomizes the film to a degree of perfection.<br/><br/>This film is one of the most important and special films of the 20th century. It caused controversy and hate among people, but despite it all came through it to be seen as a cinematic masterpiece that will be enjoyed for years to come."
"TheUnknown837-1","7","2","4","8 December 2009"," Stanley Kubrick's satire on crime and justice is just shy of being a great movie. It's perverse and provoking, but there's also mad genius beneath its repulsive content
","One thing was certain about Stanley Kubrick: once you gave him complete control over the story of his film, you were at the mercy of his malice and onslaught. Like his science-fiction classic ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", his 1971 film ""A Clockwork Orange"" was and still is a film of heavy controversy and debate. Some laud the movie for its satirical and dark humor when addressing crime and punishment. Others believe it's just too dark, too nihilistic, too right wing, and brutal to be taken for art or even a good movie.<br/><br/>What's my verdict? Well, somewhere in the middle. Overall, I enjoyed the movie, but to me, it's not a masterpiece. I really enjoyed the first half of the movie. I liked the middle section, but the third act just fell apart for me. Perhaps I wasn't quite ready just like I wasn't prepared for the Star Child scene in ""2001"" and wasn't sure how to take it. A second viewing might help. But one thing is for sure about ""A Clockwork Orange."" It is a brutal, disturbing, and even at times offensively off-putting madman story. But buried beneath all its exterior horrific content, there is also a sort of mad, maniacal genius that holds it together.<br/><br/>The film is set in futuristic Europe, during a time when all the people in world seem to have gone nihilistic and pornographic without a fear or care. A young rapist named Alex (Malcolm McDowell) is captured by the police after accidentally murdering his victim and becomes subject to a new sort of government test that should cure him of his evil waysbut things might go awry.<br/><br/>The first half of ""A Clockwork Orange"" really shocked and appalled me. There were times my stomach turned around inside of me because it was so disturbing. I actually felt uncomfortable and even a little unclean sitting there watching these scenes of explicit rape and nudity and almost dance-like violence. Kubrick clearly wasn't afraid to let his expressionism free on the screen. But oddly enough, although I felt really bad watching these scenes, I also felt kind of awed for I understood that Kubrick wasn't glorifying crime, he was kind of alerting us to how many people seem to glorify it. In a way, he's alerting us to our own perverse thoughts. This is also aided by the fact that our protagonist is one of the screen's most offensive villains.<br/><br/>The middle section of the film was not as good as the first part. When Kubrick started to satirize the justice system gone madI felt the movie became way too talky and verbose. Characters would say a whole lot of words but communicate very little point. And then the third act just became too slow for my liking and this is what ultimately cost the film a potential fourth star. Kubrick had a lot of say, but I don't think he said it with the right notes.<br/><br/>I say notes, because Kubrick is also making majestic uses of classical music during scenes of violence and madness. Ludwig van Beethoven's symphonies are used several times throughout the film in surprisingly appalling but ingenious ways. Edward Elgar's classic ""Pomp and Circumstance"" also makes a wonderful appearance in a wonderful sequence. You can say another thing about Stanley Kubrick's (and can see this also in ""2001""): he had good taste in music.<br/><br/>Perhaps I am writing this review a little too early. Maybe ""A Clockwork Orange"" is not a film that can be properly analyzed and reviewed after a single, unprepared viewing. But I will say this about my first impression of this dark and perverse tale. It is good film-making. And the performance by Malcolm McDowell is hands-down brilliant."
"Sandcooler","9","2","4","24 March 2009"," Might as well be Kubrick's finest
","Malcolm McDowall's Alex is easily one of the best leads ever to make it to celluloid, he's truly a thing to see. Alex is just right, the right mannerisms, the right tone of voice, the right expressions. They say no movie can compete with a person's imagination. They are wrong. I've read the book, but this interpretation of it is better than I could ever imagine. Just the inspired narration already gives you the idea that you're watching something brilliant. A lot of the genius to this movie is in the way the violence is handled. Innocent people get beaten up all the time, and Kubrick manages to make it look really beautiful. The classical music is a great touch as well. I watch Kubrick movies mainly for the stories that are always well-developed and the cinematography, but the actors steal this movie. Not that Kubrick's efforts are any less remarkable though. I'm running out of hyperboles, but this is a marvellous work, one of Kubrick's true masterpieces."
"benjamin_lappin","9","2","4","2 January 2008"," Nature Or Nurture? Kubricks Second Masterpiece
","An engaging journey through the mind of a deranged schizophrenic and the ever present worry of an ever present government in search of control, A Clockwork Orange is as beautiful as it is disturbing, as thought provoking as it is mind shattering and as wonderful as it is brilliant. While fans of both Kubrick and cinema (although I hasten to add that in my personal opinion the two are intrinsically entwined) may, and no doubt shall, debate which out of 'A Clockwork' and '2001' is the superior masterpiece, Clockwork certainly, at first, hits the viewer hardest with its blatant head cracking ideas thrust into your minds like subliminal messages. <br/><br/>I would like to state I can understand why there are those that detest this film, or those who fail to see the merits of Clockwork. It is without doubt a very seminal, very brutal, very aggressive and very hard hitting film (not 'just' in terms of violence) yet the scenes of torture, rape and the ultra violence while still powerful in terms of ideas are not off putting to the point of grotesqueness in terms of cinematic viewing, the point being - it works. But to not like this film is to miss the point entirely.<br/><br/>I have spent time sifting through countless reviews on the negative side of these boards, and yes there is violence, yes it will play with your mind and yes, as one reviewer pedantically complains, it puts Beethovens 9th to a somewhat distorted use, but 'only' ostensibly. Beethovens 9th is truly a beautiful composition, his most well known and arguably one of, if not, his greatest, but the use of it is realised fully once Alex has gone through his therapy. For Alex it is the piece of music which is tainted, he finds not the images of The Third Reichs on-goings disturbing but the ""sin"" of using Beethoven to this passage. He does, and cannot differentiate the morality of the violence he acts and perceives but he recognises the beauty of Beethoven he fails to see in people, while we as an audience are eternally aware of the wrong doings, which leads on to my next point...<br/><br/>Many complain that we are forced to sympathise with a criminal rapist and murderer, that come the films conclusion we are somehow on his side, and this is never the case. We are never sympathetic towards the character, we merely pity him. We never sympathise with him because of choice. As many know, A Clockwork Orange at its heart is the story of state control versus free will, but at such extreme ends of the spectrum that it can off-put some. Alex never redeems himself by never choosing the morally correct path, his ""redemptive"" attempts in the prison and his willingness to partake in the therapy are merely ploys to earn himself an early reprieve. So, in turn when he is 'cured' by the state, he is never actually cured his moral compass is still pointing in a negative direction it is merely that he is unable to act on his impulses as a human, which provides some great moments of irony in the latter stages. <br/><br/>A Clockwork Orange is too detailed a film to thoroughly and properly dissect in the alloted word space, and even if tripled, quadrupled etc etc chances are a coherent conclusion would never be attained, there is so much going on. You are left not only debating internally the free mind versus state control argument but you also end up taking a very Marxist philosophy on Alex as an individual; has he chosen this life, or is he a by-product of society? Is it nature or nurture? Regardless of answers or opinions, A Clockwork Orange is a very thought provoking, very intelligent, very skillfully created, directed and composed piece of art that deserves critical plaudits as a truly great film which can rank up unashamed with 2001. For those that view cinematic entertainment as popcorn with CGI sequences of continual action then this will annoy and likely disappoint you, and for those that will not look past this films exterior I am sorry you missed out, but this is cinematic entertainment at its purest, thoughtful and thought-out theatre which will play with your mind, and you may not even know it."

"Hannibal_Chigurh","10","2","4","25 October 2007"," The Greatest Book Adaptation Ever
","In 1971 Stanley Kubrick decided to adapt the cult novella A Clockwork Orange. Stanley was no stranger to controversy (he adapted the novel Lolita back in 1962), but the firestorm associated with this film would make Lolita look like a Disney film by comparison. The film takes place in a futuristic England and centers around Alex DeLarge, a psychopathic teenager who leads a gang of thugs and rapists. He and his ""droog"" (friends) speak in a special slang called Nadsat, which was invented by the author of the book. Alex is played by Malcolm McDowell. To get an idea how good he was in this role, check out the rest of his work. Nearly every role he played after this had roots in this villain (especially Caligula). He also was the first person in a Kubrick film to use the maniacal stare that Stanley transfered to Nicholson in ""The Shining"" and Vincent D'Onofrio in ""Full Metal Jacket."" <br/><br/>In typical Kubrick fashion, the film leaves all endings and assumptions to the viewer. In fact, even the genre of the film is subjective. For some, it is a thriller that follows one sociopath's voyage through the criminal justice system. For others, it is a morality play that questions just how far the government can go. I see it as a dark comedy that tackles both of the aforementioned subjects. Kubrick blends the genres in a way that had not been done before and has not been seen since. When it was released it was considered disturbing because of its depictions of violence and rape. The truly disturbing feature of the film is that it can make you laugh at these heinous crimes. You'll laugh your head off then be ashamed of yourself.<br/><br/>It will take multiple viewings to comprehend the genius of this film, but it's the only film that I've ever had to watch more than once that is immensely entertaining upon first viewing."

While still in prison, he discovers religion and yearns for a day when he will be ""good"".<br/><br/>The thing that really caught my attention was the creative use of colors. This becomes obvious right from the starting title, which is has a bold red background. Other uses of color include the white and black outfits of the gang and the decorations of the rooms (the design of Alex's bed cloth especially sticks out). The music mostly consists of classical tunes from Beethoven, which mixes with the color to create a vibrant atmosphere. This, along with some of full frontal nudity, makes the film truly feel like a work of art.<br/><br/>The performance by Malcolm McDowell as Alex is priceless. The rest of the acting in general is good, and the characters are very interesting. Its neat to see how their actions towards Alex are reversed from the first half to the second half. I found the Chief Guard to be an especially likable character; he serves as a comedic diversion during some of the darker scenes in the middle.<br/><br/>A Clockwork Orange is rich in themes that include identity, choice, forgiveness, and crime. Kubrick creates a world that absorbs viewers without any effort and leaves them in awe. The movie itself is a journey that takes you through an experience that you would not have otherwise. It may even change the way you look at criminals. This is a movie not to be passed up!"

","""A Clockwork Orange"" is Stanley Kubrick's film based on Anthony Burgess' novel. The story follows the life of Alex de Large, the leader of a gang in a dystopian Britain where gang violence has become an overwhelming problem, leading the government to use radical measures to placate gangs. The film raises questions of what measures are appropriate to deal with the surge in gang activity.<br/><br/>The technical qualities of this film are superb. Bizarre imagery and sets are used to great effect. The score is a mix of synthesizer music and classical pieces and suits the film very well. Classical music is also incorporated into the script in an intelligent way because one of Alex's chief interests is Beethoven's music. The idea to set a sex scene to the ""William Tell Overture"" was also an inspired choice.<br/><br/>Malcolm McDowell gives a perfect performance as Alex de Large and creates an unforgettable character. All of the film's supporting performances were effective as well. This film's script is engaging and never failed to keep me interested in what turn Alex's life would take next. At times violence and rape are depicted in a deeply disturbing manner, yet this film never fails to be compelling and thought-provoking. Another interesting dimension of the film was that it had its own vernacular of slang terms used by Alex and his gang members. ""A Clockwork Orange"" creates a world that is shocking yet provocative and enthralling."

","It's not perfect, but it's pretty close, and it's incredibly visionary and ground-breaking. The first 45 minutes or so is absolutely perfect, and as a result the rest of the film feels slow and disappointing, but it all works together at the end. McDowell is fantastic and Kubrick's twisted direction is expectedly solid. The combination of classical music and that haunting, synthesized score is brilliant, and makes for some of the most memorable moments in cinematic history. ""Singin' in the Rain"" will never be the same.

"swmayer","8","2","4","6 April 2007"," ""When a man cannot choose, he ceases to be a man.""
","In this case, Kubrick's haunting directing and McDowell's disturbing portrayal paint Alex de Large as man for the sake of his monster.<br/><br/>Large is a violent, drug using, rapist, turned accidental murderer with a sickeningly easy going attitude. Through a series of seemingly random crimes he and a crew of three others rampage across what seems to be a futuristic London landscape and cityscape reeking general havoc on the population. Explicit scenes depicting sinister nudity rattle the viewer into a sickness that rivals the one later induced on Large through a series of ""therapeutic"" sessions in which he is forced to watch scenes of sex and violence while drugged.<br/><br/>The impression of these scenes sticks to Large and is virtually incapacitated whenever he attempts an act that is violent or sexual in nature. Allegedly coincidently (though the cell-search scene in which Large's interest in Beethoven is discovered by his tormentor suggests otherwise) he is also conditioned to react the same way whenever the ninth symphony falls on his ears.<br/><br/>Large is subjected to the rejection of his family and the revenge of the souls he wronged in the beginning portions of the movie and eventually attempts to kill himself. His attempt fails, but his extended unconsciousness erases his conditioning and the final scene hints at his future return to his disturbing crimes.<br/><br/>Large is frightening human. His narration borders on quaint as he feels himself to be a sort of hero. Instead he depicts the anti-hero; a protagonist too human to understand that his drives and lack of ingrained moral senses are abnormal. Whether driven by the search for a new high or a disorder native to the most frightening of psychopaths, the ""humble narrator"" of this film will not be easily forgotten."
"Det_McNulty","9","2","4","26 February 2007"," Yes, It Certainly Is One Of The Most Essential Pieces Of Cinema. The Amount Of Influence and Power ""A Clockwork Orange"" Has Had On The World Is Truly ""Majestical""
","Controversy is a popular aspect in the world of art, people flock to see something that is seen to be offensive or shocking in one form or another. This goes for the infamous A Clockwork Orange, famously known for being one of the most controversial films of all-time. I would say it lives up to its title, especially when you look at it from the perspective of a viewer in '71. A Clockwork Orange still holds up today as being a frighteningly disturbing portrait of a ruthless mind. Though not quite as graphic as one might expect, the film holds no bars on its disturbingly genuine nature and shocking content, though all of this is a primary factor of the film's moral. A Clockwork Orange is neither exploitive, nor degrading because all the content is in equilibrium with the importance and startling impact of the film.<br/><br/>Adapted from Anthony Burgess' novel, A Clockwork Orange follows the futuristic story of the foul, repulsive and oddly intelligent sickening screwball Alex de Large (Malcolm McDowell) and his gang of ""droogs"". They prowl the nights with their disgusting habits of terror and take out their undesirable temperament on the unsuspecting public. Alex eventually gets arrested and put upon a scientific rehabilitation program which is supposed to make the degenerates of society ""normal people"" and eventually making it impossible for Alex to commit any kind of wrongdoing. The experiment does not quite go according to plan for the young hoodlum.<br/><br/>For a film of such fierce, challenging, depressing and wildly vivid nature there is still so much wonder and beauty to be found from it. The sheer magnitude of the film's unparallelled intelligence, entertainment value and ingenuity is something that will grasp even the most easily offended or unpredictable of viewers. Whether you like or dislike A Clockwork Orange remains to be seen (yes, it is certainly a film that does not appeal to all tastes) because you will undoubtedly respect for many reasons.<br/><br/>The audacious title, ""A Clockwork Orange"" is quite possibly the finest film-title ever imagined, it helps you understand the film and primarily represents the ""controlled mechanism for maintaining society"". Ultimately, Alex becomes artificial on the outside, while still being perverted at heart. The number of morals and ethics discussed throughout the film is something that deserves the utmost appreciation of the literature essays the novel and film receives in schools around the world. Violence is an emblem of human nature, yet it is something that should be restrained and compressed through self-control. The film shows how even the most cruel and vile of human beings still have humane rudiments. The film goes into studying youth frustration, the rebellion in youth, individuality, philosophy, the breeding of control, , society ranks, conformity, realising one's problems, being ""somebody"" rather than ""something"", freedom (being reborn/revitalised) and how violence breeds violence. The film gives such a wonderful message and also morals for its viewers, yet sadly it is one that has been cruelly misinterpreted by the more immature viewers. The film's final line sums up a lot about what I have mentioned above in the notoriously clear, resounding and extraordinary image. <br/><br/>Legendary director Stanley Kubrick gives a visionary adaptation from page to screen, giving the film a versatile and unique quality. The use of colourful and techno set-pieces creates the mad-world, which is so close to our own. There are so many tiny details the film holds, everything from the astonishingly unforgettable makeup to the masterful facial expressions from Malcolm McDowell all help to create a timeless experience in visceral film-making. The adaptable use of poetic slang makes you apart of the gang experience, putting you into the shoes of the one of the ultimate anti-heroes. It is poetry brimming with a glorious elegance and harsh boldness. The use of quirky dark comedy is hysterical and at the same time bewildering helping to make the viewing even more immersive. The editing it magnificently displayed through a graceful use of slow-motion and fast-forward scenes, the film's bare style is truly stunning. Malcolm McDowell's performance is one of the greatest character performances of all-time, Kubrick's casting decision is beyond perfect offering an actor the role of a lifetime.<br/><br/>Some people have accused this vivid spectacle of a social commentary of being self-absorbed or aching mass attention. I don't see A Clockwork Orange as that, rather it's quite the opposite, it gives people a discussion point and a discussion point that questions one's own views. A Clockwork Orange asks the viewer for their own opinion and their own conclusion for a story that is so surreal, yet, still being so sincere about the society we live in."

","Okay, so many of the 10-star reviewers said they didn't like this movie the first time they watched it, but that they loved after repeated rewatchings. I'm telling you, if you want to understand it and LOVE it the first time through, read the book first! It's one of the best books of all time (just like the movie is one of the best movies of all time), and you'll get a head start on sorting out all the themes.<br/><br/>Then watch the movie. See what Kubrick lends to Burgess's masterpiece. See the juxtaposition of classical music (actually much of it is from the Romantic Era, not the Classical Era) against ultra violence. See Malcolm McDowell's amazing act (and the amazing acting of pretty much everyone else in the cast). See his amazing turnaround(s), and marvel at the most disturbing happy ending of all times. Then leave the movie screen, unable to think of ""Singing in the Rain"" and ""William Tell Overture"" in the same way ever again.<br/><br/>I won't go into great details to explain the plot, as you can find it on other reviews in this site. However, I will go on a bit farther to name random thinks I loved. Firstly: ""Singing in the Rain"" was more appropriate and more effective in this movie than it was in its own movie. Secondly, the humiliation scene was simply amazing, and very sad. Thirdly, the scene where ALex leaves his parents' house after they gave his room to a tenant made me cry and cry and cry and cry. Fourthly, the threesome played to the ""William Tell Overture"" is the BEST bit of fast motion in a movie. . . EVER!! Fifthly, everything else in the movie was amazing.<br/><br/>Yes, so read the book first, and then watch the movie, and you'll enjoy them both immensely. Read the book also if you want to know the meaning of ""A Clockwork Orange"", because the movie never really explains it. Oh, and look past the violence and sex. My parents refused to watch it because of it, my sister walked out after the first ten minutes, and my brother wasn't able to see past it. But I was, and I marveled at what I found underneath. This isn't a light entertainment film, nor is it a glorification of violence. But to see that, you need a brain--scratch that, a functional brain that isn't allergic to a good workout. Then you're set. Enjoy the greatest masterpiece of film-making!"

","I am not one of Kubrick's greatest fans but i respect people that serve art from an original perspective. Movies like clockwork orange are like free passport to immortality and i think that the director is succeeded in this particular matter. If we take artistic expression from a holistic and historical approach we will realize that art travels through time, but the masterpieces that will remain forever are the ones that manage to gather many subfields of art to the same melting pot giving a pure example of harmony. Cinema has that ability, a great director is able to combine photography, painting, literature, philosophy and music under the same roof. The percentage of deep knowledge in each subfield of art will increase the possibility of creating a masterpiece. In the particular movie the director proves that he is a great composer and a real scholar as he manages to express his deep knowledge in matters of social norms and instinctual struggle. The human behavior which is governed by dark powers that work underneath our consciousness is a basic issue that is pointed in the particular film. Even under captivity and under authoritative rules we are managing only to cover up and fix the surface and the expression of every behavior,the real cause of our behavior is something that we cannot easily understand. Law and punishment stands as a regulator and a barrier in order for such behaviors to remain in the dark. Such behaviors are purely unethical and cannot secure social stability.All rules have created in order to prevent the species from extinction.In clockwork orange obey on rules is something abstract, the starring character which is brilliant on the particular film but also in many others that i had the chance to see him loves violence and expresses his self in a way that only animals do and governed by a primitive behavior. In every society, persons like him are a threat and have to be punished in order to secure the safety of the whole. Although the extinction of the particular behavior has its own risks, a non aggressive person in a high competitive society is the weakest one and really soon the fittest gets him down if we want to use the words of Charles Darwin. Kubrick realizes the whole condition and creates it on the film,in some cases the major interest of art is to depict and describe a political or social condition by identifying itself with the particular condition or staying against it. In clockwork orange the director is describing everything with the most clear and realistic way without interfere with the judgment of the viewer. For some people the neutral perspective is wrong,for some others not, although the final judgment and the creation of emotions is based on millions of people so the wright or wrong does not fits here. Finally i would strongly reccomnet a masterpiece like that in a matter of a cultural and stylistic expression, the movie in a way depicts the whole fashion and the trends of the time with many psychedelic art elements that come along with the outbreak of drug culture in art and everyday life."

It's disturbing to see the human form be reconstructed in such a way, and yet there is something disturbingly satisfying about actually seeing bad come out of this sort of situation. When it happens to somebody who only wants to hurt people, does that make it justified? This issue is still just as relevant, if not more, relevant today.

","With his excellent, but violent movies like for instance Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, Kill Bill..., Quentin Tarantino is seen as one of the best directors ever. And yet, what he does isn't all that renewing. Stanley Kubrick did it before him in 1971, more than 20 years earlier, in a decade where violence in movies wasn't yet as tolerated as it is today. So in a way, Kubrick was more ground breaking than Tarantino will ever be (Not that I'm not a fan of QT's work, I certainly am).<br/><br/>This is how the story goes: In the UK, somewhere in the near future, Alex is the leader of a gang of teenagers. He enjoys rape, violence, everything sadistic and ... Beethoven's classical music. They spend their nights terrorizing anyone who they might encounter. One night, they break into the house of a woman with a lot of cats and kill her, but than his gang turns on him and leaves him to the police. He is sentenced to 14 years in prison, but he finds a way to get out of prison soon. The government needs more prison cells for political prisoners and all he has to do is to be a guinea pig for a scientific experiment. The experiment should change violent people into good, sweet and loving people, who are no longer able to even think about violence. Alex immediately agrees, because than he'll be able to get out of prison soon and return to society as a good and honest man. But the experiment has some unforeseen side-effects. He nearly dies and his case becomes a major embarrassment for the government, who arranges to cure him of his cure.<br/><br/>What may be the most thought-provoking about this movie is the contrast between all the violence and the beautiful classical music, composed by Beethoven (I guess the man himself could never have imagined his music would be used in such a context). What you see is awful and the music accentuates that even more, but thanks to the music it also seems to be more ""digestible"". But don't think this movie is a celebration of cheap violence, it certainly isn't. If you look closer, you'll see that it's against violence, but also against any dictatorial government who thinks it should control its citizens by any means.<br/><br/>Perhaps it is all a bit difficult to understand what I mean and I guess you'll have to see the movie for yourself to fully understand it, perhaps even more than once. Only after several viewings, this movie will get fully through to you. And after you've seen it at least once, you'll agree with me that this is an absolute masterpiece and that it deserves a full 10/10."

It has been praised, hated, and argued about since its release. A CLOCKWORK ORANGE is loved by critics, filmmakers, film-students, and dumb goth kids. It is hated by other critics, other filmmakers, other film-students, and dumb religious freaks. Kubrick has always been controversial, here most of all. The cause of the heat surrounding the picture is that no one can agree on what the movie is really saying. The film was hot enough to be nominated for Oscars, but too hot to win them (strange, since MIDNIGHT COWBOY won two years before).<br/><br/>Let's get down to it. The film itself is terrific. Kubrick's cold, objective style brings the viewer the spellbinding tale of a violent, drug abusing punk in an England of the future who gets screwed by a system that longs to regain control. Anthony Burges's book provides a language that accounts for so much quotable dialogue, Kubrick's camera gives us a stark Pop Art future that is a stage for our players without overwhelming them, and Malcolm McDowell gives one of the best psychopath performances that's ever hit the screen. Viewers come away with ""Singin' in the Rain"" on their lips and a terrifying treatment on their minds. It makes Beethoven take on a whle new meaning! You won't soon forget this.<br/><br/>The film's depiction of sex and violence made this a forbidden item in 1971. But the blood and nudity do not justify the initial X rating. The MPAA wasn't willing to admit it those days that they rated films for their mood and ideas rather than their actual content. The picture is certainly not pornography and it's not a horror film. This is a well crafted film about the problems with society and the justice system. Everyone should see this at least once."

This violent, and sometimes unbearable to watch scene is what makes this film so interesting, good, and daring. I think this film is an excellent horror/fantasy/sci-fi flick!

The special vernacular used by the movie's juvenile delinquents puts me in mind, however, of the ""computer-nerd"" language used by teenagers at the start of the new millenium as a way of setting themselves apart from their 'square' and 'pedestrian' elders.  A future society that revells in extreme violence was also more than touched upon in the 1976 film ""Rollerball"", but thankfully these dire predictions have not yet been realised.  A much better film (based on a protracted adventures of a young man, at odds with the world around him) would have been ""O, Lucky Man"" (also with Malcom McDowal), two years later.  As a film of prophecy, one has to say that ""Clockwork Orange, A"", like ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", pretty much fails in every respect.

","I have to agree with a previous comment about the detractors of this movie; it seems this is not the right movie for people who just wanna see the classic psycho movie characters and be scared (while laugh at the characters' foolishness inside). This is not that kind of movie; so just watch The Shining (a really good movie, btw) instead of this if that's what you want. ACO isn't, indeed, an easy movie; Stanley Kubrick did a wonderful job in trying to make the audience identify in Alex's character, while keeping Alex's character himself so unbelievably real that sometimes you think Malcolm McDowell was real crazy. That's probably why the movie is psychologically shocking (and no, you don't see that much blood or straight violence on the screen). This is not, indeed, a movie translation of the novel itself: although they share the sharp sense of humour of Alex's narrative, the story is slightly different, and the reader doesn't identify with ""the novel's Alex"" that much; as Burgess himself said, the movie is ""Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange"", the book is ""Anthony Burgess' a Clockwork Orange"". I'd say their aim was pretty different: Burgess' primary one was probably to describe society dehumanization, Kubrick wanted to show how criminals aren't ""aliens"" and sometimes respectable people aren't better than them. This is, probably, why the movie was dubbed ""disgusting"" by so many people. The movie is visually really different from anything else ever appeared on the screen: not at all hollywood-looking (nothing fancy looking here), and maybe that's another reason why the ""anti"" camp is still pretty big; nevertheless, I think Kubrick did a wonderful job in describing those ""futurible"" suburbs. One final note: the movie described a very close future when it came out; now it's probably more like ""an alternate world"", although really close to ours. That's why the movie itself still keeps his scary fascination.<br/><br/>10/10"

","I rented this movie recently after many years, while I was on a Kubrick kick. Sadly, unlike other movies of his which only improve with age, ""Clockwork Orange"" appeared superficial and repetitious. Usually Kubrick's typical intellectuality and coldness didn't overwhelm his work because he chose subjects in which a fair degree of human passion figure, thus supplying him with a ready-made counterweight to his own approach. But when the subject is psychopathic violence and state-sponsored mind control, the limitations shine through in a hard, unyielding way. As for its shock value, that will always garner some enthusiasm from (usually younger) male viewers. No surprises there. That the limited violence is still appalling even when compared to the easy ultraviolence of more recent movies, is testament not to genius but to a failure to build a more extensive narrative framework. A lecture on morals, not a lesson."

","""A Clockwork Orange"" is a film I didn't quite get the first time around, and it's interesting that many other people felt the same way in their first viewing.  I mean, how am I supposed to react a scene where Alex and his Droogs are raping an innocent woman, while he happily sings ""Singing in the Rain""?  I'm no sadist.  <br/><br/>However, in the second viewing, I realized the film's moral value and was able to indulge the spectacular visuals.  Kubrick has that masterful quality that sucks you into his movies via the initial shot.  The opening shot of ""CO"" is a memorable one in which we see Alex (Malcolm McDowell) staring straight into the camera, evil in his eyes--which do not flinch for a second.  Combined with the astounding soundtrack, highlighted by Beethoven's ""9th Symphony,"" we're dazzled by this hypnotic piece of artistry that contains maximum doses of style and substance.  <br/><br/>There are many lessons to be learned after watching this movie.  Because ""CO"" deals with all the faces of evil.  We embark on a journey, through the mind of Alex, bringing us into his sadistic world.  There's a great scene in which Alex retires to his bedroom, puts on Beethoven's 9th and we see a montage of violent sequences interlocked with close-ups of Alex's face with blood seeping out of his mouth.  We learn how these acts of violence and rape stimulate him to the fullest.  Then we learn about the jealousy that exists among evil.  When Georgie wants to take over the Droogs and become leader of the pack, Alex tosses him in the water along with the slow-witted Droog Dim, and slashes him in the hand teaching him a lesson on who's the boss.  And finally, when Alex commits his last murder, we learn about the betrayal that spawns from evil.  All of Alex's fellow Droogs beat him senseless and leave him at the scene of the crime, allowing him to get picked up by the authorities and thrown in jail.  In jail, we learn about how ""supposedly"" morally correct individuals try to eradicate pure evil. We're introduced to a fanatical preacher, who feels jail is the best punishment for this group of sinners and they fully deserve to rot inside until their souls are cleansed.  That shows how religion can sometimes be exaggerated and far-fetched, and religious leaders don't always take a realistic approach to these matters.  Alex is later rehabilitated by being put through an unusual procedure.  He is forced to watch scenes of brutal violence and rape, put to the soundtrack of Beethoven's 9th Symphony.  At first, he feels satisfied.  But as his mind gets healthier, he gets more and more disturbed by these images.  And we learn that the healthy mind is not able to withstand such evil.  Alex was able to withstand this evil in the past, because his mind was in a sick, demented state.  After Alex is fully rehabilitated, he's released back into the world and--unfortunately--things don't turn out so good.  His family doesn't want him anymore.  And we learn more and more in upcoming scenes how evil cannot be tolerated by society, and how evil acts of violence and rape are not forgiven or forgotten in the eyes of those who were traumatized, no matter how clear Alex's conscience happens to be.  And society will often use evil against evil.  This is the type of the movie that gives a raw, unflinching look at the evils of society, how we deal with them, how we're faced with them, how they're inflicted upon us, etc.  This is one of the best social satires ever made, brutally portraying all the ""dark sides"" of society.<br/><br/>The dialogue is also memorable--though sometimes difficult to understand. This is the type of movie that is great in all aspects.  It's not only emotionally stimulating, but visually stimulating, in a way only Kubrick could've expressed it.  I can't imagine any director doing it any better. <br/><br/>
""A Clockwork Orange"" is Kubrick's most noble masterpiece, and a definite must-see!!!<br/><br/>My score:  9 (out of 10)"

","This is the one moment in Kubrick's career when he overdid the `found' music thing.  He makes the most liberal use of Beethoven, Elgar, Purcell, Rossini, Dvorak, Rimsky-Korsakov ... have I left anyone out?  -although I must say that his use of music is often as cunning as ever: at its first appearance the use of Rimsky-Korsakov's `Scheherezade' struck me as being a cheap device, but it turned out a moment later to offer a sly remark on Alex's fantasy.  But `Pomp and Circumstance'?  Too obvious.<br/><br/>That's my quibble out of the way.  When I saw it `A Clockwork Orange' did everything to justify its reputation as a masterpiece, although, curiously, very little to justify its reputation as a sick excursion into the old ultra-violence.  In fact it struck me as the product of a more civilised age.  (Whether or not it WAS the product of a more civilised age, I wouldn't know: I wasn't alive back then.)  Note how we are asked, as if it's no big deal, to feel sorry for Alex.  After committing terrible crimes he is altered so as to be physically incapable of committing any more, but this isn't enough for the people whom Alex has wronged.  They want to see him suffer.  Not to any particular end; they simply want suffering for its own sake.  I wonder how many people these days would notice that there's anything wrong with this.  We're starting to think, once again, that the purpose of the criminal courts is to exact revenge - just look at all the `vitcim's rights' activists about.<br/><br/>Not that Kubrick's film has a message to offer them, or anyone else.  In many scenes every character present has a point and nobody is exactly right. Look at the scene where Alex is being paraded before the press as a triumph of the Ludivico technique, and the priest objects that all that has happened is that Alex has been robbed of his free will (just as he was when he was locked up).  The priest is almost right, just as the minister is almost right when he responds that hit doesn't matter, so long as the crime rate drops; but you'll notice that the reason the priest advances is a silly one: that Alex is behaving himself now only in response to a crude system of reward and punishment.  The claim that Alex has no power to make decisions, and the claim that he acts out of a fear of immediate punishment, can't BOTH be right; besides, the irony invisible to the priest, but obvious to us, is that his own fire-and-brimstone preaching is no more than an earlier version of the Ludivico technique, with this difference - it doesn't work.  Still, although we think little of the priest, and although he's wrong, we know he's on to something.  So is the prison guard whose reactions we see throughout the scene.  He doesn't take to the new technology at first, but when he sees that Alex is subject to fits of naseau - when he sees that his native cruelty will be indulged after all - he's all for it.<br/><br/>No doubt about it - a film of marvellous complexity, and, two or three shocks of violence aside, it's a delight to watch."

","Controversy, controversy, controversy. When this movie was released back in 1971, this show was shot with criticism surrounding it's sexual and violence on screen. It was so bad that Stanley Kubrick even wanted to take this film out of cinemas in the UK. But the violence and sex is not the main part of this film.<br/><br/>The film follows Alex Delarge, and his droogs (who are just his partners in crime), terrorizing and doing some of the most inhumane and psychopathic things a human can do. Brutally raping women, starting gang wars, doing home invasions, you know, the ""good old ultraviolence"". For the first 30 minutes of the film, you are being thrown at with some of the most violent and perverse images ever put onto film and after more than 40 years, it is still difficult to watch it.<br/><br/>After being betrayed by his droogs, he was arrested, and this is when the film takes an interesting and thought provoking turn. He attempts to change himself by going for a new treatment called to ludovico treatment. This is basically a torture treatment which prevents the brain from doing violent or sexual thing, and maybe just add a Beethoven for good measure<br/><br/>After treatment, he was released and immediately gets rejected and even harmed by the people he use to work with and his victims. What happens in the end is that he cannot change, so the government revert him back to his original psycho form to save themselves and possibly even him.<br/><br/>The movie's message is both interesting but extremely unsettling, and that is to say that forcing someone to change from a psycho to a normal person is impossible, and we should leave them to be what they are. It is a generally provoking take on society back during the 1970s, with the crime rate increasing in the UK, it is no surprise that Stanley Kubrick will want to have a shot in portraying this based on the book.<br/><br/>After creating 2001, he wanted to scale back a bit by making this film, which turns out to be his most playful and disturbing movie to date. It is like when The Beatles created Sgt Pepper with the mentality of experimenting and in the end creating popular culture, and then going to make the white album as a big and not so digestable album with it's experimenting and different ways. It is a same with A Clockwork Orange.<br/><br/>Go ahead and watch this film, but be warned, it's message might be misinterpreted by different people."

","As the opening credits lead us into the movie, we witness the most captivating, iconic and chilling opening scene of cinema as the camera pans out with Alex delarge's(Malcolm McDowell) eyes fixated on ours. The eyes symbolize the character's inner mind, as if reflecting the soul of evil. And what makes this scene unforgettable is its background score.<br/><br/>We are ushered into the world of Anthony Burgess, a distopyian future with a slang of its own. Alex and his droogs roam around, wrecking havoc that are beyond redeemable. One such scene shows Alex and his friends raping a writer's wife and disabling the writer's body. This then is followed by a look into Alex's personal world, who has a penchant for Ludwig van Beethoven's symphonies.<br/><br/>And his love for Beethoven is used as a symbolism for the pleasure he gets when committing crimes, as the music is played in the background. During one such crime, he is betrayed by his droogs and since the lady dies, he ends up in prison.<br/><br/>We get further insight into his psychopathic mind when he reads religious works in prison, and fantasies himself as one of the tormentors of Christ, who inflicts pain on the weak and later enjoys the company of unclad women.<br/><br/>During one of his prison visits, a political leader is looking for a volunteer for the Ludovico treatment, that basically robs the criminals of their human ability of liberty and making choices as it associates pain and trauma with their basic instincts. Seeing it as an opportunity to leave prison, Alex signs up for it despite the reservations of the church father who deemed the project immoral.<br/><br/>As he is shown videos of violence, he realizes their background music -
Ludwig van Beethoven!!! He yells and pleads them to stop it, as he would never be able to listen to Ludwig van without the accompanying pain induced by the treatment. But realizes it is just too late.<br/><br/>Upon release, he undergoes a series of abuse and heartbreak, from his parents disowning him to his earlier pals torturing him as police. And the worst happens when he ends up in the same writer's house who's wife he had raped. The writer decides to use him as a prop to expose the governments immoral project and gets him interviewed. Although after realizing Alex's true identity, he decides to push him to suicide by torturing him with Beethoven's music and blaming it on the government. Alex ends up committing suicide.<br/><br/>But he opens his eyes to a hospital where he is being treated. As the nurse shows him pictures and asks for his response, we begin to realize Alex has been cured back to his normal self, as the government wanted to escape the wrath of the public and investigations on its Ludovico treatment. Alex's original self was proof by the government that there was no such treatment done. The movie ends with Alex in one of his usual fantasies of raw sex.<br/><br/>For me, as hinted in the story, the movie is about the intrusion of the state into the lives of its common folks and that more than morality and humanity, the government cared for its agenda and results. The very government also did not hesitate in releasing back a potential psychopathic criminal into the society when it felt it was being cornered on the issues involved in the treatment.<br/><br/>And as for Malcolm McDowell's portrayal of Alex delarge, there is a reason why the character is loved(me included) despite his dangerous flaws. One of the most memorable and terrifying villains on screen. The narration by Alex was definitely praise-worthy, even quirky and humorous sometimes. Stanley Kubrick did not deserve the backlash back then for the offensiveness and the raw nature of the character and movie. And special thanks for the background music, Ludwig van Beethoven, could he get it wrong?<br/><br/>One of Stanley Kubrick's finest works."

The protagonist is not a real person, but the embodiment of the dark side of society (evil). The homeless man on the street represents the old system aka feudalism. The prison sequence explains how fascism deal with evil. The crippled elitist liberal represents communism, who comes close to killing the evil but cannot finish the job. The last scene at the hospital 'democracy' revives the half dead evil, feeding him by his own hands because it benefits his agenda.

","A Clockwork Orange is one of the most provocative, disturbing and incredible movies ever made. Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of Anthony Burgess' novel is a dark masterpiece that won't just let you have a apathetic stance while watching it; the movie is for some either highly thrilling or digusting - or both. The story is narrated by Alex, leader of a gang in a somewhat dystopian-futuristic Britain. Through what they call ""ultraviolence"", the gang commits various atrocities - their senses sharpened by narcotic induced milk. Kubric didn't refrain from using graphic representation to the many acts of violence commited by Alex and his droogs - this is why the movie remains controversial to this day. It's interesting how the dark nature of youth is portraited here. Alex and his friends do not follow any moral code or ethic principles stablished by common sense or laws; even when they have problems amongst themselves the only outcome is violence - it's a way of showing how primitive is a society in which the strong are the ones who can do whatever they want. After being betrayed by his droogs, Alex is caught by the police; this is when the story shows another side of violence, or rather a new source - ""An eye for an eye, I say, if someone hits you, you hit back, do you not? Why then should not the State very severely hit by you brutal offenders not hit back also?"". He is convicted for murder and sentenced to fourteen years. In prison he engages in religious activities, although his ""evil"" violent nature didn't really change - that comes clear when he pictures himself as a roman soldier during the via crucis. The movie comments on how the prison system tends to worsen the nature of a criminal rather than changing it - ""Prison taught him a false smile, the rubbed hands of hypocrisy, the fawning, greased, obsequious leer. Other vices prison taught him as well as confirming him in those he had long practised before."" Alex offers himself for a experimental treatment offered by the government. The Ludovico experiment promises to ""cure"" a criminal by eliminating his evil nature; the real point is that the treatment rather than causing a moral change in the character, it actually is a conditioning against any wrongdoing - in a way that the free will is taken away. Alex's nature doesn't really change, but since he's inclined to do bad things, his urges are surpressed by a terrible feeling caused by the treatment - ""Choice! The boy has not a real choice, has he? Self-interest, the fear of physical pain drove him to that grotesque act of self-abasement. The insincerity was clear to be seen. He ceases to be a wrongdoer. He ceases also to be a creature capable of moral choice"". When Alex is finally released the world around him is not the same it used to be. Upon arriving home he discovers his parents rented his room to a guy called Joe, but he's unable to do anything beacause of the treatment. Alex is a fragile person in a ultraviolent world; that's shown when he's beaten up by the same tramp he's beaten in the beginning of the movie. Later on he's also beaten up by Georgie and Dim, his former droogs that he abused so much during his time as the gang leader; this time they're actually from the police and once again the violence from the state is shown. The movie portraits the rise of a totalitarian state; a state that takes away the violence from others not as to make the world good, but as to monopolize violence itself. The state took Alex's capacities of reacting whilst hiring violent members of society to its ranks. Every action has a reaction, everything you do comes back to you. Everything Alex did wrong comes back to him. In the final segment of the movie, he is rescued by the one writer he caused so much damage to. The writer and a group of subversive people plan to prove the government is trying to create a opressive state - as depicted in every scene after Alex so called cure. They try to make Alex kill himself by forcing him to listen to Beethoven's 9th symphony. Alex does not die and in the final part of the movie we see him being visited by the minister in the hospital; the minister tries to talk Alex into convincing the media that the government isn't up to anything shady. The young man's former nature seems to be back, as he pictures a scene in which his former impulses seem to be alive again, and he closes the movie with a haunting last line, ""I was cured, all right!"". This movie is brilliant in every topic it comments upon; The nature of violence, violence from the state and the rise of totalitarian regimes, the failures of criminal system and the nature of good and evil. Of course it is not a simple movie nor it is easy to sit through and watch; all the graphic violence displayed is not for everyone and it remains one of the most controversial movies of all time. However, it is a very interesting and important movie; Kubrick's direction is sharp and Malcolm McDowell acting is just superb. For everything it tries to do, it succeeds in a mesmerizing way; the plot still holds a huge analog value to our reality - don't let anything hold you from watching this."
"Hudsconey","10","0","0","19 November 2019"," A Dostoevskian tragedy
","Where does one begin when reviewing this movie? Many people just shrug and say ""this film is pointless!"" But that is a narrow minded take on anything Kubrick has done. This film is far from pointless, and is one of the most mature films the Director has done.
Others, though, hate the film because it makes you sympathize with a terrible person like Alex DeLarge. I feel like this is probably what Dostoevsky was criticized for with his novel ""Crime and Punishment"". Both A Clockwork Orange and Crime and Punishment are about sick people that are jerks to their ""friends"", however, in your heart of hearts, you want to see their redemption. In many ways, A Clockwork Orange is a response to Crime and Punishment. One of the key parallels in both works is when the characters in both stories are in prison, reading their Bibles. In Crime and Punishment, the main character sees himself as Lazarus, being raised from the dead. At that moment, He makes the choice to be good. However, in A Clockwork Orange, when Alex is reading the Bible in prison, he pictures himself as the Roman guard whipping Jesus, and then pictures himself as some great King being fed grapes. At that point, Alex doesn't make the choice to be good, but wants to pretend to be good so that he can get out of prison. This movie deals exactly with what Crime and punishment was dealing with: only the pure in heart can properly function within a society. The film confronts our culture's desire to only change people's visual acts, when in reality, only the heart matters, and only the individual can change their hearts. So are we supposed to sympathize with Alex? Yes. Because we want to see his heart change, like the Dostoevsky character. But we can't change his heart. Only he can."
"Xenix94","10","0","0","15 November 2019"," Sly natures and free will...
","This film is brilliant. Why? Well, it makes me think of good and evil and how they have the ability to arise in a dynamic environment. What makes a man a man?<br/><br/>Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange seems to examine humans as subjects bound to their inner desires. I see it as a satire of a totalitarian society more or less. A Clockwork Orange takes place in a futuristic dystopian society. A dynamic environment is present displaying chaos through the littering of trash and the formation of such gangs as Alex's. As the movie progressed I began to see a dualism. One see's a society at the start of the movie in which man is exercising his outer state, the succulent lively surface (An orange). Alex has full opportunity to exercise his free will in a dynamic environment. Alex then gets arrested. While in prison, Alex is offered a treatment known in the movie as Aversion Therapy. The treatments aim is to reform the criminally inclined individual into being a good person. In return he would get his freedom. He ends up receiving this treatment. However, he ends up being like a clockwork toy, wound to their liking. In short, the duality of the control over man and free will (Clockwork/Orange)<br/><br/>To me, Alex represents the inherent evil nature that resides in all humanity. Alex is the personification of that evil in us. Each of us has the right within a civil society to choose how we act. I see evil essential, just as good is essential. There is a balance that is to be achieved for full understanding and enlightenment to take place. I feel that the good in people arise naturally, just as evil arises naturally. Alex becomes a puppet or mechanical toy tweaked to the governments liking. As a result, I feel like Alex looses his humanity; he ceases to be a man. It instead confines him and tortures him in this living hell.<br/><br/>Kubrick did a magnificent job with the camera work and set designs. I particularly love the opening sequence when Alex is with his ""droogs"" sipping on ""milk plus"". How the camera pans out in combination with the music is brilliant. It immediately sets the tone for Alex's sinister sadistic character. As Alex goes about with his ""droogs"" reeking havoc, I love the succession of set locations and designs. It makes me feel as if I'm truly looking into a cryptic otherworldly society.<br/><br/>If you're into cerebral films, this movie is for you. It makes one think about what it means to be human and how evil and good go hand in hand. Good isn't always good, bad isn't always bad. The sly natures induced by free will perhaps offer some zest in a mundane ridden life."

","A Clockwork Orange stars Malcolm McDowell and is directed by Stanley Kubrick. The film revolves around Alex who's favorite hobbies include rape, stealing, and violence. When I first watched this I was shocked by how graphic it was, but I couldn't take my eyes off. And then I watched it again it started to turn into one or my top five favorite movies. I'm a big fan of A Clockwork Orange that I decided to pick up the book as well. And between the book or the movie I choose the movie. I choose the movie because the movie lets the audience decide what Clockwork Orange means to them. But the major difference between the two is the ending because the movie tricks us into thinking is Alex cured or not whereas the book he is cured, but he starts to grow up that in the end feels like a cop-out. I've seen people laugh at this, or look utterly confused because they don't understand the plot and that leaves me with two ideas. To the people who laugh at the movie mean that you either have a twisted sense of humor or there's a little bit of Alex inside all of us. And to the people who are confused with the plot I say watch this again so you have a better understanding of what the plot is trying to show you. And if you can't grasp the plot than you are part of society or refuse to accept of what are society is slowly becoming. And if you don't believe me, Stanley Kubrick and Warner Bros decided to pull this film in the United Kingdom. And it wasn't until Stanley Kubrick's death in 1999, that the studio decided to release it in the United Kingdom. And the end result was that people in Britain consider his a national treasure. But really fascinates me is the complex character Alex who we despise at first because of his violent activities, but later on in the film, we feel sorry for him, that he wasn't such a bad character. So in the end, this movie made my top five movies because this offers such complex and graphic themes that I became hypnotized by it that made me explore films that aren't cookie cutters you see today."

It contains some Symbolism, a respected bunch of ideas and philosophical thoughts about the human, the free choice, the governments, the politics, and the media. Kubrick takes you through a cycle of big questions, the battle and moral choice between good and evil, without making clear answers, leaving you with an ambiguous ending.<br/><br/>Talking technically, the movie is perfect in terms of directing, soundtracks, screenplay, and acting.

Stanley Kubrick's dark, satirical and atmospheric film about free will, violence, authoritarian order and brainwashing. Kubrick, who has always been a filmmaker that prioritized look and sound over story, (But never in service to it) is in a league all by himself. The production is phenomenal and the atmosphere is intoxicating. Clockwork also boasts a terrific performance by Malcolm McDowell. His portrayal of the sociopathic and charismatic Alex, is one of cinemas most memorable. A film that pulls no punches. It takes shots at liberalism and authoritarianism and shows how easily the public can be swayed one way or the other. A though-provoking, funny, perverted, exceedingly violent and stylish motion picture. In short, a beautiful nightmare."

","Although titles such as ""Psycho"" (1960) and "" 2001: A Space Odyssey"" (1968) often come to mind when talking about movies that are still relevant, I do feel like ""A Clockwork Orange"" (1971) manages to deliver a more stable, not to mention a more fulfilling plot. And although comparing these titles to one another is more or less suicide on my part, you have to agree with the fact that gang violence, sex and drugs are more mainstream than murderous motel owners as well as a flying chocolate bar. (Yes, that's a nod to Tim Burton's ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" (2006).

This changes after a stint in prison(I won't say why, just watch)and after a type of treatment Alex seems changed and is put back into the world, the point though, is Alex really 'better'.<br/><br/>Malcolm McDowell is electrifying, bizarre, hysterical and chilling in his defining role as Alex. The guy is simply unstoppable as the truly nightmarish teenage, you cannot take your eyes off him whether he is brutally killing, being really funny or even sympathetic(towards the end).

","Stanley Kubrick's bizarre, stylish, disturbing, crazy, confusing classic is still a controversy and a film that few truly understand. Kubrick does a great job directing this film, yet doesn't explain it well enough. We clearly see the work of a director in each scene, Kubrick's style and artistic vision evident from start to finish. Yet I feel he struggles in creating a vision that lets his audience actually understand what point he wants to get across. Malcolm McDowell gives a complex, layered performance as Alex the psychopath who enters grueling psychiatric care in order to be cured of his evil and transformed into a productive member of society. McDowell is electric, terrifying one minute, then sweet and reserved the next. It takes a truly gifted actor for us to hate his guts one moment, then empathize with him the next. Stanley Kubrick has good intentions in adapting this creative and visionary tale, yet could have done things differently to have it come across more clearly. He ends the film perfectly, an ending I would argue is one of the most satisfying and unique endings in film history. If Kubrick kept a more clear and less distracting vision from start to finish, we'd have an absolute masterpiece, not a confusing pulp film that leaves more questions than answers."

I suppose I liked him and cared about his character despite his criminality. I think it was overly pornographic and a bit slow. It had a good ending. Nitpick is how they don't know what the word subversive means and how Nazi parades that are really just them showing off were shown as evil film. My real rating is 6.5."
"robinwalker-335-781943","Null","0","0","25 July 2017"," Not great
","The director wants the audience to feel something as bad not because he is showing it as bad but because it really is bad. The background music accompanying the ultra violent scenes is comical, and not dramatic or anything else that is commonly associated with such scenes. This gives the viewer an opportunity to feel the bitterness not because the music hints so but because he himself feels so. Viewer's emotions should arise irrespective of what the director is trying to show, and this is one of the greatest successes of the movie.<br/><br/>Another glorifying feature is the central idea of the movie. If a human is striped of the choice to choose from good and evil, he no longer remains a human, he becomes a clockwork. When Alex is brain-washed and ""programmed"" to choose only good, he wasn't accepted by the society and this shows the irony in the objectives of the British Government. The word Orange from the title presumably comes from the word ""Ourange"" that loosely means man. And hence the title is so appropriate to the movie.<br/><br/>The artificiality in dialogues and sets give the movie a unique feature and enhance the grip on it. This also means that the viewer has to get more involved. This is definitely one of the best technically shot movies, another masterpiece of Kubrick like the Space Oddessey.<br/><br/>For the uninitiated, set in near future Britain, the movie shows Malcom MacDowell as the head of a group of youngsters involved in sexual violence. Turn of the events leave the protagonist in the hands of the police. Worried by the growing number of prisoners the British Government devises a method of ""programming"" them so that they always choose the good. Alex is chosen as one of those on which the new system is to be tested. The rest unfolds as a saga of the very human characteristic."
"batskitbomb27","Null","0","0","31 March 2011"," A Clockwork Orange – Stretching the Boundaries
","A Clockwork Orange (1971) is an artistically inventive approach to a possible, not-so-distant future. The story takes off with the introduction of its main character, Alexander DeLarge, portrayed beautifully by Malcolm McDowell. The audience is then taken along for a ride to experience the nighttime festivities of Alex and his gang. An ordinary night for them consists of drinking spiked milk, beating howling old men, instigating fights with other local gangs, causing cars to swerve out of control while playing hogs of the road, and then a bit of sex with non consenting victims. Though the film is set in a future where the young are cunning and ruthless, Alex himself still seems to be a misfit of his time. All he seems to understand is crime. He enjoys every awful bit of his adventurous evenings without ever shedding any signs of pity or remorse. In his mind, it's as if it's right to be incompetent and abysmal. According to Alex, living this life of constant immoral crime puts him one foot above the rest of society. Even his fellow gang members (referred to as droogs in the film) don't always agree with his self-centered indulgence. Eventually the droogs decide that they are no longer going to tolerate his leadership. When this decision is first brought up to Alex, he punishes them in a memorable slow-motion scene. The droogs then devise a plan to double cross their unwanted leader. Set up by his supposed friends, Alex is left helplessly injured at a crime scene. The cops arrive on site to find Alex with a nasty blow to the head by one of his droogs. It is then discovered by the police that Alex has murdered a woman in her home. This ordeal sends him straight to prison where he's forced to cooperate with the law. While serving time, Alex learns of an experimental procedure called ""The Ludovico Technique"". This so-called treatment was designed with intent to reform criminals and keep them from ever committing crimes again. Alex, in an attempt to escape the dreadfulness of prison, manages to win himself a role as the human guinea pig for this new experiment. However, the final outcome of this new treatment is not what Alex expects to receive, and once free from the clutches of prison, he finds that the world of his past has long since transformed into a vengeful realm that is not to his liking. There is a wide diversity of characters in this film. Each character, big or small, finds a way to stand out and be unique. For example, the constantly grinning P.R. Deltoid, performed intriguingly by actor Aubrey Morris, finds a way to always steal the audience in his limited screen time. His unique character ends almost every sentence with a questioning ""Yes?"" Another character that frequently stands out in his limited screen time is the lovable character of Dad, played by Philip Stone. Stuttering Dad always seems scared to death of his own son, Alex. What many may find interesting about the script of A Clockwork Orange is the fact that the dishonorable main character is never truly punished for the crimes he commits. Instead, he's simply rewarded for them. Alex never truly reforms into a better person. The story devises a way for the audience to root for this demented character. Alex enjoys and loves every last bit of his evil actions but doesn't end up being punished for the extreme crimes he's committed, which is totally contradictory to the standards of the Classic Hollywood Style where the villain almost always paid for his wrong doings. Wendy Carlos was in charge of the music for this film, and was responsible for the computerized sounds this music created. Kubrick & Carlos continued working together, and similar music can be heard in Kubrick's later film, The Shining. In some scenes of Clockwork, the music featured is very contradictory to what is happening in the scene itself. For example, there is a scene featuring happy, dancing music while the scene itself is showing the audience a gang tearing off the clothes of an innocent girl and attempting to rape her. There is also a scene where Alex is singing to himself the famous, happy song, Singing in the Rain. As he's singing this happy and joyous tune, him and his droogs are beating an elderly man and preparing to rape a helpless woman. These scenes really find ways to discombobulate your mind. (Great Bolshy Yarblockos!) The editing of this film remains distinct with its classic long, still shots, and its frequent zoom-ins and zoom-outs. There is a memorable high-speed scene in a bedroom where Alex is enjoying a threesome with some girls he encountered at a music shop earlier in the day. The shot is quite long even as it is being shown in high speed. There is also the slow motion scene that was brought up earlier where Alex feels he needs to put his droogs in place by injuring them and pushing them into the harbor. These fancy shots give the audience a different and more unique product than what they would be given if the scenes had been shown at regular speed. Kubrick was not on a quest to give the world a movie they had already seen. He wanted to emphasize the film's uniqueness in every way possible. In some ways, A Clockwork Orange can reflect the exploitation period of cinema. Some aspects of the story can be considered a cautionary tale, feeding on the fear of the unknown future. This story can remind mankind to enter its future with caution, and to make sure that upholding the law remains enforced. This is truly a story that can be looked upon as a warning. In summary, A Clockwork Orange is a story about a boy who knows no good. For a change, the film shows the perspective of a violent demented character as opposed to a rugged heroic figure."

The big desire of the scientists to control the thought of the people and your acts is other subject very interesting; however, I saw an ethical problem. The scientists that were testing the new method with ""Alex"" did not know exactly the side effects in human beings. Maybe, the method had been tested in mice but, the movie doesn't show the previous tests. I think that Alex never changed your desires; the only thing that the medical staff could change was the reaction when Alex thought to act. Although the method seems effective, the ""bad desires"" remained being equals and checked at the ending of the movie.

","I think this movie is like the Horror Theatre, it plays with the audience and mocks it with pleasure. ""A Clockwork Orange"" wittily plays with the natural human longing for redemption... If the movie could talk, it would say: ""You want Alex to change for you to feel safe? For you to think that evil people change? Well, I'm so sorry sirs and missus, it wouldn't be realistic would it? Ha ha ha!"". The movie plays with your mind as the scientists did with Alex, the movie tries to cure you by letting you watch all those horrible graphic scenes, but... Does the movie succeed, or do you turn out just like Alex did in the end? Are you back to the old-love-of-watching-sex-and-violence? About Alex's character, the first thing that pops in my ""gulliver"" when I think of him is a zombie man, or a machine man, that drifts in life according to his instant desires, urges and conveniences, as if he was a marionette of his own animal impulses and/or external coercion. Oh, and by the way, Malcolm McDowell's interpretation of Alex is just lovely.<br/><br/>After watching this movie I was left with the general idea that evil human beings are just that, and that they'll never change, don't waste your time hoping on it.<br/><br/>The movie has got a lot of laughs, is a witty farce showered with black humor. If you want to keep your mind and conscience clear, don't watch it, it won't give you any hope."

","Not sure what to rate it, and I have seen it twice. Just wanted to point out how funny the movie can be because the actors were still all shouty (remnants of stage training, RP, and probably less sophisticated sound recording than we have now).<br/><br/>POSSIBLE SPOILERS FOLLOW: For filming, where did they find so many examples of ultramodern 60s-70s architecture? As bleak and soulless as the authoritarian state in which they lived. Interesting to note that, although it's set in a fictional futuristic society, it really is only a distillation of 1970s modernism - but very immaculately done. I suppose in 30 years we will be laughing at today's visions of similar societies. I had a laugh watching him put his little cassette tape into a fancy player. I once saw a 1969 movie in which sound was played from discs that looked a lot like CDs!<br/><br/>The purple-haired nurse who ran the free-association test on him sounded as patronising as a children's programme narrator from the same era. Judging by his responses, had the accident reversed the treatment? He seemed to be back to his usual cocky self, as well as being able to enjoy Beethoven again. Can a coma reverse brainwashing? If so, he should also have forgotten his former vices too. But I guess reality must be suspended when it comes to movies."

","First, only people can be characterized as being irrational or illogical, not inanimate objects like films. Second, ACO is neither of these but one of the greatest movies ever made. Third, Burgess was a satirist and so too were some of the greatest writers and thinkers who ever lived: Horace, Juvenal, Swift, Pope, Zola, Voltaire, Moliere, Orwell, Huxley, Cervantes, Erasmus, Byron and Waugh. Satire is defined as a literary work in which human vice or folly is attacked through irony, derision or wit. It is the role and indeed the moral duty of the artist to critique, poke fun at and even attack if necessary the social milieu in which he or she lives and Burgess and Kubrick do this with a vengeance in ACO. This being said, the book/film is not a celebration of anarchy, carnality or any other iniquitous human endeavor or condition. Just because a piece of art depicts a certain thing does not mean that the artist endorses or advocates it. This is a simplistic analysis. As I have written previously, Burgess was satirizing the State's treatment of violent crime ie. its conditioning of Alex and his subsequent transformation into an empty shell of a human being incapable of moral choice. What the State did to Alex was equally as insidious and horrifying as the crimes he perpetrated in the first place and perhaps even more so. See my comments of Nov. 14th for a more complete treatment of this theme as well as the other difficult and complex issues addressed in the book and film."

"bliebert-1","Null","0","0","12 May 2004"," Deeper Analysis
","Clockwork Orange, directed and written by Stanley Kubrick, is a film about a young man named Alex.  He is a cheerful but sadistic boy who enjoys rape, violence and classical music.  During the nights, Alex spends time with his three `droogs,' terrorizing those he encounters.  One night, after killing a woman, Alex's gang turns on him and allows him to be caught by the police. Alex winds up in prison with a sentence of 14 years for the murder. However, he hears about a free ticket out of his sentence.  Being a guinea pig for a scientific experiment which will `cure' Alex allows him to return to society.<br/><br/>The feminine roles in this film are largely diminutive to males.  Women are externalized as sexual objects, and not human beings.  In one of the opening scenes, a gang is raping a young girl.  Alex and his gang spend their nights raping a pillaging the homes they visit.  Women become naked idols, not representing their true beauty.  Kubrick develops females as part of the panoptical regime through the forced effusion of objectification.<br/><br/>Clockwork Orange places characters into categorical extrema.  There are the ultra-conservatives who refuse to believe in a problematic society (Alex's parents).  There are the women and men who become victims of brutality (rape and beaten victims).  And finally exists the stereotypical sexually aggressive, libido-driven males who wreak havoc on society (the gangs). These stereotypical extrema exaggerate society in a way which critiques the behavior of individuals.  Deriving from these specifics is a theme of predator-prey between males and females.  Females appear only in powerless situations, which they have no control and no resolve.  Women become a backdrop to the film, casting their importance away in society."

","A Clockwork Orange is by far my favorite Kubrick film. It is dark, violent, futuristic, and bizarre in the greatest way. Malcolm McDowell gives a powerful and gripping performance as Alex DeLarge. The violence may not be for all, the murder, rape and torture is very graphic in this movie. The use of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony is great and the use of Singin' in the Rain may get some to think of the song a little differently (It may not be your favorite for that much longer), I loved the song even more. The rehab and scenes at the milk place is great and you never know what Alex is thinking, but do you want to. The color gives it a look of the future and it does a good job. I recall three songs, Beethoven's Ninth with the Ode to Joy, Singin' in the Rain, and the William Tell Overture through the movie. The music is top notch and one of the best choices for music I have ever heard.<br/><br/>Made in 1971, however, it was greatly overshadowed. Movies like Dirty Harry, Fiddler on the Roof, The Last Picture Show and The French Connection. The French Connection won Best Picture, Actor, and Director to name a few. This movie should of won something even though it was probably to bizarre for the Academy. Malcolm McDowell gave the performance of his career and Kubrick is at his finest.

The ironic use of violence/rape by the Droogs is not seen in such other films of the day as: Easy Rider, Alien, The Conversation et al. A couple people didn't 'get it', and treated Kubrick's film as an endorsement of crime.<br/><br/>All that aside: I thought it was pretty good. Kubrick's visuals set the industry standard, as per usuals. Wendy Carlos' neo-classical, techno-synth harmonics are a great way to replay the musical giants of Europe's past. Her contribution to the film was good enough that 'Tron' is now on my must-see list.<br/><br/>I didn't like Beethoven's music being used as decoration to destruction, since the nature of composition is creation. Maybe that was intended as a means to create tension, I don't know. I also hate it when eyes get mutilated in movies (Stir of Echoes, Minority Report, Jackass: The Movie).

Although the characters and story are ""borrowed"" from original book I think that Kubrick's main point was to show(I find Alex as one possible way to see Kubrick's idea in a story) how strong and longlasting man's (unique) identity is and how futile is the INTENTION to change someone (including yourself). Changes come from behind INTENTION is what I want to say.<br/><br/>Do you find it harmful that Alex's (in the movie and outside) identity costs raping, killing... (as a metaphor).

I've never read the original book by Burgess, but it surely seems not to have been the easiest novel to be transposed onto celluloid.  Yet Kubrick has made a wonderful creation of it.  It has all the designer stamps of 1970's fashion over it, so it makes for curious retro-viewing. The characters, their costumes, their language, and their visits to the 'milk bar' are all originally crafted.  At first you might think that this film is going to be a couple of hours of pure excuse for erotic violence, but then a genuine profound plot starts to ensue, and then you're taken on a path with no predictability whatsoever.  <br/><br/>I think it's a classic, but I also appreciate that the tone of it may hold wider appeal to a British audience, where it is all filmed.  It has a certain darkness to it which could only stem from the grey housing estates of Northern England.  I hired this video in Japan boasting to my landlord that this was a superb movie, but after 15 minutes he just reached for the off switch, claiming it was too incomprehensible (plotwise not languagewise) to follow!

It's a test for the viewer as to whether or not you can watch the film and still sympathize with the character after seeing their bad side graphically displayed. I love this character. Not because I agree with his violent life style, but because he was human. It proves that everyone human has at least one thing in common, and that's the ability to feel emotion. At the end of the film Alex has a chance to get `cured' of his violent phantasy's and life style. Of course you can't cure a lifestyle if the character doesn't believe it was wrong. Science can make things appear as if they were normal, but science can't cure what's on the inside.    The message that I got out of the film was that each person is truly an individual based on the thoughts they think, that no one else can hear. As a result, individuality can never fully be taken away. It's a triumph of our own private thoughts and internal emotions over science."

","So much has been written about this film, not least on the IMDb, however,a few facts need to be established for the benefit of those who were not around at the time of the original release in 1971. At that time the British newspapers were full of articles condemning the film as a disgusting,depraved,celebration of violence and pornography.The government of the day were being urged to ban the film before civilization as we know it was destroyed.This is not an exaggeration.Much the same thing happened a couple of years later when The Exorcist was released.Of course, none of the so-called guardians of the nations morals had actually seen the film, but they knew enough about it to try to stop the rest of the country having the opportunity to make their own minds up.Which of course is one of the themes of the story.So all this tied in quite well with Kubrick's intentions.He was never in the business of offering answers in any of his works and this is no different.You make your own mind up.The world was a very different place in 1971 and cinema audiences,on the whole, were not so sophisticated as they are now.Or maybe not so blase about sex and violence not having been fed the constant torrent of such material that the modern world takes for granted.But without A Clockwork Orange its very probable that the trail may not have been blazed quite so soon.Whether you think that's a good thing or not is up to you.But at least you have the choice.To correct another common misunderstanding,the movie was never banned anywhere (in the civilised world that is).Kubrick withdrew it from British cinemas within a year because of the way it was misunderstood and misrepresented by the British press.You could, however take a short trip to Paris where it was shown almost constantly.It was only when Kubrick died that his wife decided to allow the film to be re-released in Britain in cinemas and on video that modern audiences got the chance to see for themselves what all the fuss was about.And the general concensus of opinion seemed to be that in comparison to films such as Goodfellas,Taxi Driver,etc, A Clockwork Orange wasn't much to get upset about.The passage of time had dulled peoples senses. But,a lot of what is depicted in the film has since become commonplace.The acceptance of violence,the casual attitude to to casual sex,the alienation and fear of people living in so-called modern housing developments(some of the film was shot in the Thamesmead housing estate in south London which has since become a run down no go area populated by gangs of violent thugs).As to the main thrust of the piece,whether it is right to take away someone's freedom to choose,the jury is still out.You make your decision. This is a great work of cinematic genius.It is unrivalled by any other film, it is unique.If you come to watch it with preconceived ideas you may be disappointed so keep an open mind.When Kubrick was looking for an actor to play Alex he only had one man in mind,Malcolm McDowell.He had seen him in a movie called If...in which he played a rebellious public schoolboy.To this day McDowell has never come close playing another part like Alex,not because he isn't a good actor,but because,quite simply there is not another part like Alexander De Large.This is a 10/10 movie.See it and watch a masterpiece."

","I try to avoid talking about classic movies. They have already been analyzed to an extent where it almost becomes an impossibility to come up with anything fresh or interesting to say. But A Clockwork Orange is a film that is still making itself today. 	Of course, not of the same effect today as it had on audiences in 1971. With it being placed next to such modern controversy as Natural Born Killers and American Psycho it is hard to appreciate just how original it was when it was made. Yet still it holds strong as the reigning king of controversy to this day, and with changes in society and science fiction on a whole, it is an exception to be made when coming time discuss its content.<br/><br/>	At its best, A Clockwork Orange is an `out-there' type of cult masterpiece, staging over-the-top theatrical tactics to make its point, while at the same time breaking it down into mockery. 	At its worst it is still a pretty good, if not an overrated classic of flawed proportion, whose reputation has been built, more so, on the controversy that surrounds it than on the technique of its filmmaking.<br/><br/>	The first half of the film lives and breathes its character, Alex de Large. Alex is ` a young man whose principal interests are rape, ultra-violence and Beethoven.' An anti-hero whose mind is set more on anti than hero. A character study all to his own right. He and his `droogs' roam the streets of a futuristic society at night looking for old men to beat and women to rape for something to do. 	But when one of the victim's dies and Alex is betrayed by his friends, he is sent to jail. In jail he hears of an experimental government program that is designed to get criminals out of jail and keep them out. Alex is the first test subject. 	After being forced to watch videos of violent behaviour, Alex is released back to a society that doesn't want him, making him sick to all the ills that he used to be a part of, creating a doubtfulness towards the power of society and politics. 	Some have argued that director Stanley Kubrick `made' A Clockwork Orange. But in the shape of it all, this film is more a vibrant distraction from the lively sarcasm of the much superior book of the same name, by the late Anthony Burgess. 	What Kubrick is missing here is much of what made his adaptation of Steven King's The Shining so disappointing. Failing to implement key story traits, Kubrick directs his vision, but not the same vision of politically incorrect poetry that made the book such a pleasure. 	The book was a first- person character study, existing within the paradoxes of an individual mind without the use of third person analogies. This is not a problem to the genius first half of the film. But after Alex is released back upon the world there is nothing but third party character present, making it unbelievable to distinguish Alex from just another background fixture. Changing from character study to storytelling, forgetting that the story lies in the character. 	The most noteworthy of controversy attached to A Clockwork Orange was its label as `violent porn.' But in looking at such criticism with equal opportunity to criticize we can see that the term `violent porn' has spawned for the narrow influence of individuals who base philosophies on their first reactions. 	`Porn' is an adjective, describing an outlet for gratuitous sexual stimulation. There is nothing that I can find even remotely pleasurable in the horrifying acts committed in this film, and anyone who argues differently has fetishes that run deeper than the content at hand. 	 As for `violent.' It is another adjective, but this time misinterpreted as a noun. Because the word, in this case, is not to be used as a noun we rarely witness the violence. It is a mere deterrent used to describe the atmosphere. On the other hand, the violence that is seen is viewed from a comedic standpoint. That's the gift of satire, you don't have to find it funny to be able to laugh. 	If anything this is a positive film, teaching the Christian belief that it is the right of all individuals to have free will and choice. As stated by Blake Morrison in the book's introductions, `Alex must be able to choose to be good; he must be an orange, capable of growing and sweetness, not a wound-up clockwork toy.' Meaning that an orange may be bitter at first but it has the ability to grow on its own and ripen into something sweet. Unlike clockwork which only works on the basis of what it is programmed to do.<br/><br/>	Malcolm McDowell doesn't only play Alex, he is Alex. McDowell goes so far for absolute broke in his take-no-prisoners performance, that it could have ruined the film and career of a lesser man. In a role that is so rowdy, McDowell never takes himself serious Always sporting a mean grin of pleasure and a jolly sort of stance, making him nothing short of unintentional evil. A scene in which Alex kicks a man who is down while reciting Singing in the Rain is of utmost classic and one of the best in this film.<br/><br/>	A Clockwork Orange is not an easy film to watch or even all that inspiring of one either. It knows that just as many people hate it and don't understand it as those who love it. But those who do love it love it for the right reasons. Not because it is a well made film. It is nowhere near a definitive Kurbick masterpiece, but because `when a man does not have the ability to chose, he ceases to be a man.'"

","Science fiction stands apart from other genres because it is actually a setting and nothing else.  It is a toolbox of ideas and items that storytellers borrow from to try and heighten their work.  Matrix, Aliens, and Terminator are all action movies that borrow the sci-fi elements of machinery, technology, alternate realities, and souped-up firepower--that's the only thing that separates them from the Die Hard films.  Even Blade Runner is just detective noir set in 2019, no different.<br/><br/>Only in 2001: A Space Odyssey did the full impact of unadulterated science fiction get ingrained in the public conscience because Kubrick makes the setting the star, not plot or characters.  He would later try again with Barry Lyndon to lesser extent.<br/><br/>Compared to Sam Raimi, who isn't concerned with shot composition so long as the movement of the camera remains wild, Kubrick's parallel (or is symmetric) style is the definition of precision.  He loves orchestrating his shots around the characters in ways I'm sure Brian DePalma dreams about. The focus isn't on the people, it's on the scene and mood.  The fact that people are in the shot is incidental.<br/><br/>That said, A Clockwork Orange is a genre-less picture.  The setting is not pure science fiction, but it certainly isn't anything other than drama. While not as declarative as Dr. Strangelove, it succeeds in making the science fiction point about what humanity's actions cause to our collective thoughts and psyches.  In this case, our newest crop of bad boys are in for some brainwashing fun.  Shallow yet insightful.<br/><br/>Overall, between Ludwig Van's pomp and the shaky chords of ""Singin' in the Rain"", Kubrick proves he is still the music man of synchronization while McDowell menaces.  4 out of 5."

","Though I've seen it a few times, I felt the urge to give a comment on this masterpiece ! Unbelievably produced in 1971 by mastermind Kubrick, this movie takes you on a journey into the mind of a disturbed mind obsessed with violence. The thing is, that what seemed to be a drastic production of a culture hardly ever seen in 1971, today this film makes an excellent, though a bit overproduced, image of todays society. Take away the silly outfits, the naive community and the classical music, replace these with Doc Martens/bomber jackets/shaved heads/swastika symbols, a hardened society and a Skrewdriver album. Suddenly you have a production of the future to be of some unlucky individuals. <br/><br/>This is a movie of which I have never seen anything like. It's a must-see production !"

","This is a unique movie in many respects. The great kraftsmanship of Stanley Kubrick is shown in that film as in none of other of his works. Even though the story is narrated by the leading character, the presence of the director is strong and can be seen in every meticulous detail of the set. It is director who orchestrates our emotions all the way through-from repulsion to the protagonist at the beginning to pity in the middle of the movie, ending with something like understanding of his joy of returning to the old ways,-and yet the director is absolutely distant-he tells the story without any passion, attempt to show his sympathy or make a judgment. It happened as it happened, and it is a spectator who suppose to form his opinion. As always with Kubrick, there is a lot of keen satire, and the soundtrack is quite stunning. Violence as a form of art has never been so convincingly put on silver screen. That might be a rare case of movie being even better than a book it's based on, though the last chapter is sorely missed. We've seen violent childish youngster Alex, we've seen 'cured' Alex, we've seen recovered Alex, but we haven't seen Alex growing old and turning from violence to creation and facing adult life. But then it might haven't made such a catchy final. Otherwise, almost perfect picture. MacDowell never been so good too."

Even though the film has a ton of nudity and a lot of the ""ultra violence"", it still finds a way to go up on everybody's ""top 10 movies of all time"" list. I think that Malcolm McDowell should have received the Academy Award for his role as Alex. It's so real and shocking at the same time how well he goes into the character. You can tell from the opening shot... his cold stare into the camera looking right at us... you can tell just by watching him that he isn't just playing Alex.. he IS Alex. The infamous ""Singin' In the Rain"" scene is forever burned into everyone's brain. It was brilliant acting, and not to mention the excellent direction by one of the best filmmakers of the past century: Stanley Kubrik. I also think he should have received the Oscar for this one. Somehow the way he moves the camera is artistic and very unique. There's no words to explain how I feel while I watch a Kubrik film. It's such a special experience I can't quite describe it. Stanley Kubrik was a man that was always ten years ahead of his time; and so will this movie."

","A film of this caliber come only once and a while and you know what I know I not the first person who has ever said this but A Clockwork Orange is the most though provoking and brilliant films ever made. Forget what other people saw this movie was way of ahead of its time. The author of this book Burgess did a good job of creating the idea but the vision that he saw and the vision that Kubrick saw are two different things I won't get into that but who cares the movie was awesome. I remember being 14 and seeing this movie as one of the trivia answers at the cinema I then saw it at blockbuster. I read the box and was amazed. I read the book first because I anted to make sure it didn't have any graphic depiction of rape since I don't like to see that in films. Then I did research every day I looked up Clock work Orange at school and every day I read articles about it on the net. This movie was how I found IMDB. Then I rented the movie I watched it three times in a row and sat their wondering why did I wait so long to see this film. I swear this movie makes me feel so alive and vibrant. I swear everyone faces Alex's struggles maybe not to the extremes as he did but I mean when we really look at our lives we do repress the true things we want to do not Alex he shows two extremes one is pure evil finding enjoyment in violence, suffering then we have him become the victim forced to see the error in his ways even though many people will disagree I was glad at the movie ending the book ending the so called extra chapter is kind of stupid. This film should be #1 on IMDB top 250 list and I don't care what anyone says."

","Not being a huge fan of Kubrick's, the only film I had ever seen of his being 'The Shining', I was quite surprised with what was to come while watching A Clockwork Orange. Having heard about the movie from a friend of mine, I thought it might have been a rather boring one. But I was pleasantly surprised. This movie conjured up images and concepts I had never felt/heard before. It opened up my senses to a whole new world. I was astounded, to say the least! Malcolm McDowell's outstanding portrayal of the young Alex De Large was one of the best I have ever seen. He made the character come to life in such a sarcastic, playful way, which at some scenes, you hated him and, in others, such as the Ludovico and Police-droogs-violence scene, you felt empathy for the poor lad. Stanley Kubrick had a very unique way of interpreting the book, written by Anthony Burgess. Kubrick created such a colourful and somewhat perfect atmosphere whereas Burgess gave a bleak, uneventful atmosphere to southern England. Kubrick's bright use of colour and symmetry gave the film a somewhat perfect, mechanical overtone. I especially liked the score, as it consisted of classical music, and some ultra-modern electronic music, possibly to capture the futuristic setting. I also loved the queer language Alex and his droogs spoke in. Called NADSAT, it is derived from Russian and English rhyming-slang, and it's a very clever language at that. It showed Burgess' intelligence to use such a colourful language, also, to describe otherwise mundane words, such as rape, (In-out-in-out), violence, (ultra-violence) girl, (devotchka) and boy (malchick).<br/><br/>Overall, if you want to see the world and movies in a different and frightfully delicious light, see this movie!"

","In one of movie history's greatest translations from book to the screen, Stanley Kubrick and leading man Malcolm MacDougal (Alex) tell the story of a young adult living in an England of the future. What unfolds is the young man's story, how he and his droogs (best buds) personify unchecked male adolescent testosterone - picking fights, doin' a bit of the old ""in-out in-out"" with any girl they lay their glazzies (eyes) on, and so on.  While on the surface we learn of Alex as a boy who is a terrible human, we also get to understand him. When he is convicted of a crime, he finds the quickest way out of the prison block - an experimental technique known as the Ludwigo project. When this less-than innocent boy is brainwashed by the governemnt, he is left numb of all his previous pleasures. While this makes him law abiding enough, it questions natural rights and society's place in humanity. The part of the priest and the politician fit in well here. The entire story itsely is captivating, but its deeper meaning of society, life and right vs. wrong is terribly intriguing. Kubrick's stunning display of driector's brilliance is amazing. While the novel, by Anthony Burgess, sheds light a bit clearer on what the story tries to talk about, Kubrick's sheer genius presents his audience with an artistic and unforgettable interpretation of this literary master piece. 10 out of 10 and top 25 movies of all time (really and truly)"

McDowell does a very convincing job by playing a scumbag of society. I dont think anything is as good as the moral of the whole movie. In fact the moral of the movie is what really makes the movie other than the master art of Kubrick. Dialogue is good as of any of Kubrick's movie but can be somewhat lenghty on some scenes. I would have to say this is one of the strangest movies ive ever seen but it did somewhat make sense to me. I gave it an 8 for cinematography, lighting, dialogue, very original story line, and great role played by McDowell. I cant say i recommend this movie to any movie lover.

"Movie_Buff_9","10","0","0","31 August 2003"," Most underrated film of all time
","If A Clockwork Orange isn't the greatest film of all time it is definetly the most underrated. It's Stanley Kubrick's best film and also his most controversial. Clockwork was far ahead of its time like most Kubrick movies, but unlike Dr. Strangelove and 2001, it was not considered great until years after its first viewing. Released in 1971 most critics thought of it as just an overly violent film with no true meaning. But the movie did strike a chord with the audience, with some starting their own gangs of violence. The violent uproar of the film was so bad that Kubrick himself took it off of theaters in England. But looked back at today, A Clockwork Orange is one of the best directed and acted movie of all time. Malcolm Mcdowell's portrayel of Alex is one of the best on-screen performances of all time. His little smirk in the opening scene sends shivers down every viewers back. Kubrick's directing of Clockwork is unmatched to any other movie. Solely because of the controversy surrounding the film, it lost at most award shows. Stanley Kubrick was robbed of not only Best Movie at the Oscars, but also Best Director. And probably the worst decision in Academy Award history was not even NOMINATING Malcolm Mcdowell for Best Actor. Yes, Gene Hackman was great in The French Connection, but his performance was nothing close to Mcdowell's. Even a nomination wouldn't have been good enough, he deserved the Oscar. In my own personal opinion, A Clockwork Orange is just a fraction of a nich lower than Pulp Fiction. Pulp getting the edge because of the original screenplay and also for being made in a time where good movies were scarce. Best movie of the 70's. Best Stanley Kubirck movie. Most underrated movie ever, A Clockwork Orange is like a good wine, it gets better and more appreciated over time."

","I'm afraid that ""A Clockwork Orange"" doesn't hold up as well for me now, nearly 10 years after I last saw it. It's very talky (not dialogue but narration, which rarely works), the compositions are overly formal and static, and Malcom McDowell's<br/><br/>performance is not nearly as impressive now that I've see ""O Lucky Man!"".<br/><br/>Worse, Burgess's language sounds much too stilted, and his story is simplistic. While the film still makes it as a black comedy, it's simply not as funny as ""Dr. Strangelove""; I get the feeling that Kubrick had no sympathy for the material's moralistic tone.<br/><br/>Of course, that criticism is made in light of Kubrick's early masterpieces and his later, mature works. I am convinced that ""Strangelove,"" ""2001,"" and, yes (and especially), ""Eyes Wide Shut"" are masterpieces, and I think that Kubrick's<br/><br/>formalism and abstraction matured into a powerful narrative and intellectual<br/><br/>force after this film.

","Absorbing from beginning to end. I'm starting to read the book now; it truly is an amazing story, but the movie is its own work of art. Many of the shots and camera angles are very modern, such as the fast-moving threesome which reminded me a lot of a scene from Requiem For A Dream...Kubrick was lightyears ahead of his time. It wouldn't have been the same without the villany and charisma of Malcolm McDowell, and though these words can't do it justice, I highly, highly recommend it, as it is now on my top films list. It's definitely not for everyone though; the indulging into violence and terrorizing others and the almost 1984 style of his treatment (which is in itself sort of a perversion: Alex still is his same person; he just physically can't do the things he wants to, and society took advantage of his disability, only accepting him when he's his old self) are enough to disgust some and simply repel others. But if one can see this from almost a darkly humorous point of view, your eyes will be glued to the screen until the end credits."

","When I first rented A Clockwork Orange I think I had the biggest grudge ever with Kubrick after having seen Eyes Wide Shut.  The first time, I only watched 45 minutes of A Clockwork Orange and thought Kubrick was only trying to shock his audience, much like the terrible movie KIDS did.  After deciding to make it through the entire movie, I was so glad I finished it. The movie has many issues to ponder and I will try to explain them below.<br/><br/>POSSIBLE SPOILERS<br/><br/>1)The priest in the film sums up the entire meaning of A Clockwork Orange. He says that once man loses the ability to choose, he is no longer a man. Alex is forced to views ""viddies"" that show ultra-violence he was once a part of.  In fact, the videos are a complete copy of the crimes he was committing, rape and murder.  Alex is forced to be good due to his violent, nauseated reactions to violence and sexual encounters.  He doesn't want to be.  When the naked woman is presented to him, he says he wants to give her a ""bit of the old in-and-out"" but then he gets sick.  He is not cured.  He wishes to be bad because that is his true nature.  <br/><br/>2)Kubrick shows violence for the first hour of the film, which is actually the film's most ingenious trait.  What Kubrick is actually doing is giving his audience the treatment Alex went through.  The audience is supposed to be sickened by the shock value in the opening parts because we are supposed to despise it and want to be good.  This is masterful and highly thought-provoking.<br/><br/>The most gratifying part of the film for me has to be the end where Alex gives his little smirk.  His acting was superb because he was completely overdoing it.  Kubrick is oftentimes praised for his art more than his film talents and this one just happens to have both elements."

","Kubrick's Clockwork Orange is a film that if you haven't seen, you've likely heard of in passing.  It's a feat worthy of recognition, as Clockwork Orange is a true work of art in completion, and the process by which it has been made. Though the film is uncannily dark and sadistic, playing humour on the farces and violent assaults caused by a group of teen boys, Kubrick is able to show such situational acts and not come off as a pretentious, violent creep.  The film's protagonist, Alex De Large (Malcolm McDowell) is a very simple creature, but comes off in a complex manner.  He enjoys raping random women with his crew of cronies, but covers it up by listening to some Beethoven when arriving at his parents' home at the end of the day. The words ""ultra violent"" keep arising throughout the film, laying out Alex's pleasures to speech, showing he not only knows his actions are legally and morally wrong, but that he gets off on that fact.  The film concentrates more on Alex than his other friends, and takes him on the route of a misguided spiritual journey, and back again.  But all along, it's hard to wonder what his intentions and mindset.  I didn't feel attached to him as a character, but felt more intrigued by the freak-gallery instinct taken on as a viewer, and voyeur. The entire film, though dark and suspicious, is pitted with the backdrop of intensely curious music, both classical and off-beat neo-synth.  The soundtrack may be the ultimate strength of the film, highlighting Alex's traumas and dramas with a very emotional sensation which backs up a moderately well-made film."

","The neo shakespearean language created in this film provides a continium of comedy for the protagonist Malcolm Macdowell. It also prevents the language from becoming dated as the dialogue is not synonymous with any modern subcultures exchange in discourse. The element of comedy comes from the juxtaposition of the language with the ""ultra violence"" performed by Alex De Large (Macdowell) and his gang. Soft words and poetic deliveries soften the displays of violence in the film (but perhaps make them darker) and also allow the audience to understand the pleasure in which the Alex takes in the violence as his antics go hand in hand with songs, laughing and poetry. (Possible Spoiler) The film is dark throughout as Alex's character has no arc, suggesting that all change in men is socially conditioned rather than a product of moral awakening. This is classic with Kubrick who changes the ending of the book to deliver a darker conclusion to that of the book much as he did with Stephan Kings 'The Shining'. If you like this film i suggest watching 'American Psycho' which also provides a satirical character who equals Macdowells nihilism and entertains in a similar way."

","I remember I was somewhat younger then. A more mature friend told me that there was a great film on one of the arthouse cinema and I had no clue what the hell it was. I saw it. I thought it was strange and there was 'something' there but that was what I left it to be: weird.<br/><br/>
Fast forward five years later, many things had changed. I took an interest in films and started watching many great films and I stummbled upon a director named Kubrick. I saw many of his other films by then and I was curious what I would think now about Clockwork Orange five years later from my first viewing.<br/><br/>And I was glad that I watched it again because so many things had changed for me the second time round. Apart from all the directing, camera works etc..., what I loved most are the comments on certain issues. Most people had already commented that the film critizises on social choice and individual freedom, however, I think there is another side of the coin which some of us had missed; which makes this movie even more of a masterpiece. As I see it, Alex (or many of us for that matter), is a victim that holds little freedom. But not just from social limitations but also from nature. From the beginning I could see this 'animalistic' conditioning and the movie progresses to social conditionings and later towards the end back to nature conditionings. It is just like the 9th symthony.  <br/><br/>EVEN IF SOCIETY SOMEHOW MANAGES TO PROVIDE INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM, WE STILL NEED PERMISSION FROM NATURE"

","Words cannot describe the genius that is Stanley Kubrick's A CLOCKWORK ORANGE; it must be seen. In fact, it must be seen over and over again, and compared to Anthony Burgess's equally brilliant novel, and then seen a few more times for good measure. Malcolm McDowell is utterly impeccable as Alexander DeLarge (get it?), a name in keeping with the sly pun names of Kubrick's DOCTOR STRANGELOVE. For those of you who haven't seen it (shame on you), I will briefly explain the title, and no more; YOU MUST SEE THIS FILM!!!!!! A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, in the novel, is actually the title of a book being written by an old man whom Alex and his ""droogies"" (""that is Pete, Georgie and Dim"") attack, beat and rob one night. The idea is that when a man loses his free will to the justice system, through punishment and so-called ""rehabilitation"", he becomes as a clockwork orange: flesh and the semblance of life on the outside, but all mechanical gears on the inside. That should give you some indication of what happens to Alex, but not too much. Remember, you're in the hands of a master filmmaker; the greatest who ever lived, in my opinion. The complexity of the symbolism, the beauty of the decor, the intricate three-act structure, the uniquely dark humor and comedically melodramatic pathos ---- there's simply no other film like it. Nor will there ever be. I consider 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY to be the greatest achievement ever made in the cinema, but for sheer viewing pleasure, this is my favorite film. See it at all costs; then see it again."

","CAUTION: INCLUDES SPOILERS. A Clockwork Orange is a classic of all kinds, this movie points something out in society, films no longer do that, they never give you entertainment and still have a moral, or classic films give you entertainment, the best entertainment, with no moral. The only film recently that has done that is American Beauty. The book is really were everything comes from, but Stanley Kubrick did a great job adapting it, he cut out the right parts, and added the right parts. I would say the film is better than the book.<br/><br/>Most people protest of it being brilliance because they think all this has to offer is stuff that playboy does, but no. Playboy doesn't have a reason for nudity, A Clockwork Orange does. The nudity shows how bad they are, nothing else, it's all simply for a reason. The moral in this is that everyone should get a free choice between good and evil, everyone does evil every once in a while, how could you go through your whole life without at least a punch at somebody, joking or not. A lot of movies show violence (The Matrix, The Terminator) how could you go through life without at least seing one act of violence. You simply can't, you can't watch the channel four news, or whatever channel it is.<br/><br/>Also, everything is superb, one scene where Billy Boy, and Dim beat him up, they play the theme, and every hit, Kubrick makes sure the sound is at the exact time, I've seen all of his films, and not one of them have one mistake. Maybe in his earlier films, but Kubrick didn't notice yet what he had to do. Not even speilberg does it as perfect as Kubrick. Kubrick makes sure there's the best cinematography ever, in his films, which I like, and these days I don't see any good cinematography, ever since Conrad Hall died, he's one of the best. Kubrick noted that a film should be like music, expressions, and feelings throughout the movie. In A Clockwork Orange it was, happy, sad, happy. I pointed out another thing, there's been no film where the character started out where he was, and ended up in the end where he was. I do think Kubrick should've added the chapter to assure everyone that Alex won't go through his whole life, raping, and hurting people. And it would be a better ending, because you know that's all he's going to do for the rest of his life, get a wife, and have kids. A Clockwork Orange is a masterpiece, the book and the movie. I advise you to read to do both, not in any order, it doesn't matter. So goodbye, amen, and all that cal."

","The film based on the book is an intriguing view of choice, personality and the morality of society and the media.  It centres around the main character, Alex de Large, and his gang of young adventurers who terrorise people for the sheer pleasure of it.  But this is not the point of the story.  The story is concerned ultimately with the right to choose how to live: to be an individual.  Should a criminal be kept essentially human by being allowed to live criminally, as is his nature or nurture, and be punished for their crimes, or be transformed into a ""good person"" through deliberate conditioning for the safety of other citizens?<br/><br/>The film takes great effort to reveal points on both sides in the backdrop of a strange nihilistic, almost cyber-punk world with fine acting, direction, and atmospheric music by Walter (now Wendy) Carlos.  The film was banned in Britain by the director, Stanley Kubrick, until recently which added to the mystic of the film, at least here in Britain.<br/><br/>This is a film to watch and in my view, the first film of this genre recognisable today as a ""modern film"" in its execution and, in some cases, a truer representation of today than one may, at first, realise."

","""A Clockwork Orange"" is such an amazing film that no words can do it justice. It was originally banned for it's violent, and sexual subject matter, and unjustly snubbed at the Oscars--no surprise.  But like all classics it has endured the test of time, and now stands as one of the most cerebral films ever made.  Stanley Kubrick the auteur synonymous with films like: ""The Shining,"" ""Full Metal Jacket,"" and ""Dr. Strangelove..., creates a believable dystopian society; that is at once right, as it is wrong.  The film features an amazing multi-faceted performance from Malcolm Mcdowell, and a vivacious directing approach by Stanley Kubrick: Kubrick's jarring visual style forces the viewers, to experience what Alex--Malcolm Mcdowell--experiences.  The films paradoxical nature is so tuned that it puts the audience on the fence; on one end Alex is a vicious, and sickening person.  But halfway through the film as he is cured--by too much of anything is bad treatment--,and released.  He becomes the victim , and while the audience at first probably jives with his vilification; eventually the abuse continues, and you end up sympathizing with a character who is innately evil, and one you abhorred in the beginning.  All in all do yourself a favor, and go watch ""A Clockwork Orange"", and than try to listen to ""Singin' in the Rain"" without remembering the film.  <br/><br/>

","Seeing it for the first time recently, I was drawn into this film (not knowing what it was at first, having missed the credits) because of the sheer visual impact of the set designs, and spent the next two hours wondering if it were intended to be futuristic, or contemporary to filming... and what all the fuss had been about. Sad to say, I am one year older than this film and the world is so changed that I doubt it would occasion much notice at an 'R' rating if released today. The storyline is well-crafted but not so unexpected to 21st century sensibilities, and the visuals, while explicit and occasionally deranged, aren't so unexpected to the student of the decorative arts circa 1970. And I've seen more violent cartoons.<br/><br/>That said, the film holds up surprisingly well, at once timeless and dated, the inflatable chairs of late-60's futurism now looking quaintly retro and Alex's rampage and treatment a flashback to the psychiatric and psychedelic better-living-through-chemicals belief systems prevalent in the same era. The very fact that one can remain in doubt as to the intended period for the duration of the film underscores Kubrick's unusual accomplishment. And accomplishment it is; I now see what it was that he may have been driving at with the disappointing 'Eyes Wide Shut', which shares similar themes of sexual alienation but has little of the charm of the earlier effort.<br/><br/>Kubrick's camerawork here surprised this jaded victim of '2001'; I see now where his legendary reputation came from, for the oddly claustrophobic expanses (if that makes sense!) and long static shots from unexpected angles contribute as much or even more than the set dressing to give this film its unified and unique visual signature. It still looks like an acid trip, as do most films of the period ('will act/write/direct for drugs' wasn't in retrospect a very good hiring criteria...), but this time it's the full-on bad flashback, not the funny-tasting colors of '2001' nor again the porcelain-worshiping comedown of 'Eyes'. This is one Kubrick film that one doesn't necessarily have to be stoned to appreciate.<br/><br/>Did I *like* it? Um, well, I'm not sure. And I think in a way that this IS the 'message' of the film; one is left at the end, wondering whom to root for and whether we ought to have watched that, and this can be taken as a comment equally valid for the perceived societal breakdowns of the late '60s. Thirty-odd years on, the elemental chaos glimpsed on the screen here turns out to have an oddly prescient ring to it while still remaining in and of its time... even if it was supposed to be 'futuristic'. I'm still confused. But it doesn't really matter; ultimately, 'A Clockwork Orange' hits a nerve so deep that the human animal can't help but twitch."

","I know there are people who hate this movie for it's disturbing violence and rape sequences. But there are also people who know that a huge amount of violence doesn't have to mean a movie is bad. Let me tell you a little secret: violence and rapings actually exist. Kubrick didn't just make them up to make a movie. They are actually there. Therefor, this movie is NOT sick, it SHOWS sick things. Just to show the viewer how sick they are. Kubrick could have chosen not to show all the violence, but then how could he have made the movie as satirical as he did? In my opinion, this is a brilliant satire on society, a satire on human violence AND the way the goverment tries to control it. It's the kind of movie that makes you think.

","Why did Malcolm McDowell not receive an Oscar Nomination for his work in this film? I have watched this film several times in the last few weeks and not only did he deserve a nomination, he deserved to win. I say this because the film, which WAS nominated for Best Picture in 1971 basically revolves around him and thus, he makes the film. I would have understood if the film had not been nominated either but it was. I feel that it is the same sort of situation as Tom Hanks faced in Forrest Gump. That film won the best picture award because it was based around his wonderful acting job (although the story was quite well done also). Although I believe that A Clockwork Orange is still an amazing movie, I don't believe that it would have been nearly as good if the part of Alex was done by any other actor. Therefore, I believe that McDowell was robbed by the Academy and I hope there are other people out there who feel my frustration!

","I have always been puzzled by the cultish fan base this film has inspired. Yes, it is one of the truly great films, but you don't see many of the others on the list--CITIZEN KANE or CASABLANCA, for instance--drawing such a passionate crowd.<br/><br/>At this point in the game, it seems a waste of time to discuss the plot, although I will touch on it briefly.  The real genius of the film, I think, comes from author Anthony Burgess and his wonderful little allegorical tale about a society so obsessed with order that it will deny its subjects the freedom to make a conscious choice over good and evil.  I especially like the complete draft of Burgess's novel, with a final chapter in which the ""cured"" Alex reaches a point where he realizes it's time to start choosing good.  But Kubrick's film--based on a draft of the novel that didn't include this chapter--doesn't go that far.<br/><br/>Why are people amazed by ORANGE?  Perhaps it is because it took so many daring chances for 1971, touching on levels of violence that today seem tame.  Perhaps it is because Kubrick, originally a photographer, has such an amazing visual style that we're willing to forgive his deficiencies as a storyteller (I've always loved the look of Kubrick films if not the flow; the moment in ORANGE when Alex brutalizes his ""droogs"" in slo-mo is still haunting and beautiful).  Or perhaps, as I have argued many times, it is because of the charming performance by Malcolm McDowell as Alex, a rogue so affable that it is easy for us to forget he is a villain (I first saw this when I was 16 and was shocked years later to see Alex listed in a book of great movie villains).<br/><br/>I do enjoy this film and reccommend it to all film buffs, but I am concerned by its fan base.  Those fans I have met seem to be more in tune to its violence--violence made more palatable because the enchanting McDowell commits it--and many of them mistakenly think Kubrick advocates the use of force through this film.  Nothing could be further from the truth, but this is the risk one runs when elevating acts of terror to an art form.<br/><br/>This film is like a lush, gorgeous painting of the planes hitting the Towers on 9/11--it has great aesthetic value but unless you understand the context the message may be lost on you."

After reading some negative comments here regarding the film, I think some want to state that the film is famous because of the shocking scenes for 1971... ultra violence was/is shocking, but is you think shocking why don't you watch for example 8mm by Joel Shumacher with Nicholas Cage in the leading role (whom I consider a very good actor).

In one of my grad psyche classes I was suprised that I was among the 3 in the room who had seen it (including my professor, who brought it up).  This movie brings upfront what behaviorism and strict training can do to a person, and if we use our imaginations, what it could do to a nation.<br/><br/>People talk about brainwashing as if it were nothing.  What was done to Alex, our humble narrator, could be done to any of us who happen to go against the morees of an area, a nation, etc.  That is just something to keep in mind for people who think that this kind of training is what should be done to everyone in jail (and those who have missed the entire point of the movie, and there are those out there). So keep alive your freedom of ideas, hopefully they aren't going to hurt anyone else. And keep alive your love for milk bars, the old in and out and of course, Beethoven.  Also don't forget it was a book, first."

","The Brighton riots between the Mods and Rockers in the late 1960's influenced Anthony Burgess's A Clockwork Orange. It is one of the most acute, powerful and highly acclaimed novels of the twentieth century. In the vein of Brave New World and 1984 it tells the story of a distopian future, the perils of totalitarianism and the danger of playing God.' However, when Stanley Kubrick brought the novel to life on the silver screen, the acts of violence displayed in the film were recreated by youths around the country and Kubrick was consequently forced to withhold the distribution rights. Nevertheless, the film was re-released posthumously.<br/><br/>The film follows the life of Alex (Malcolm McDowell) and his gang of droogs. They are a ruthless gang of four youths who steel, rape and fight their way through the film. However, when Alex is set-up by his disillusioned gang-mates and charged with murder, he faces a lifetime of imprisonment. Nevertheless, in jail Alex hears of a new aversion therapy, which allows him to be released, without threat, back into society. This, of course, has side effects. Alex is not actually cured, he is merely physically incapable of undertaking the criminal acts he reveled in prior to his jail sentence. The narrative, which is one of foreboding, is meticulously constructed to encapsulate the themes of the novel. The characterization furthers this and allows the audience to sympathize with the protagonist despite his flaws, which heightens the satire by revealing society's, rather than Alex's, failings. However, it is the script that mirrors the novel most lucidly. The language is a discerning blend of English, Russian and Cockney rhyming slang. Although it seems like gibberish to begin with, the audience slowly adjusts and becomes familiar with the prose. This mirrors the transformation experienced by Alex: at the beginning of the film he is a miscreant but he slowly adjusts and becomes familiar with the rules of society. The script therefore acts as a form of aversion therapy for the audience.  <br/><br/>Consequently A Clockwork Orange is one of the most discerning, penetrating and sagacious adaptations from novel to film. It maintains the novel's narrative, characters and themes throughout. It complements the novel yet it creates an entirely fresh and stimulating perspective in a new medium. Kubrick's highly idiosyncratic style brings Burgess's novel to the cinema with the sensitivity, intelligence and unique aestheticism of no other contemporary director."

","Bizarre and violent, Kubrick's adaptation of the Burgess novel isn't for all tastes.  While it has tamed, even to the point that it feels like some of it was done only for shock value at the time, it still retains some of its power.  Kubrick provides a brilliantly disturbing look at our society in the future, with a superb performance by Malcom McDowell.  One of the truly unique pieces of work the genre has produced."

","I really admire the work of Stanley Kubrick and believe him to be a genius. Although some of his films have imperfections(like everything in life) they are always foreshadowed, and in cases, even erased by the strong points. A Clockwork Orange IS violent, but it is also a truly brilliant, sarcastic masterpiece.<br/><br/>*spoilers to come*<br/><br/>The movie, in the beginning, introduce us to a violent rapist and his droogies, Alex. His main interest is beating up innocents and raping women. However, when he tries to impose himself as too much of a boss amongst his gang, he is betrayed and arrested by the police. He is sent to jail where guards beat him up, perverted prisoners harass him and where he keeps on dreaming of killing and raping.<br/><br/>Then he volunteers for an experimental technique, in which he is forced(without a choice, in underpowerment conditions) images of violence and rapes, all while listening to Beethoven, creating in him disgust for the act violence(even as a mere way of defense), sex(in every form be it) and even the ninth symphony by Beethoven. After this therapy, he of course is no longer a criminal, but also no longer a human being, not even able to defend himself, and completely afraid of sex. All the peoples he hurted during his life of crime then take advantage to plan revenge. He finally decides to try to kill himself. He survives, is deprogramed and in the final scene the minister ""spoonfeed""(both literally and metaphorically) him(food and ideas). Then he state to be his friend, never wanting to harm him and says that he have a gift for him. Then, Beethoven's ninth starts playing and journalists come pouring in the room. The minister really is Alex's friend(note: sarcasm). At the end, Alex summarise the movie in a single quote:<br/><br/>""I was cured all right.""<br/><br/>He was a criminal, then was reprogrammed to be a robot and finnally deprogrammed to go back to his old criminal habits. Nothing has changed in the end, but the government says he's cured, because otherwise the punlic opinion would turn against them. Another strong point about the movie is how it shows that although devoid of malicious thought after his treatment, he still can't live an happy life because everyone around him is either vengefull, violent or tries to further his own career with him(which is the case for the responsible of the treatment which Alex is privied to). The film pictures nobody as innocent.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie is more than worth watching. That is, if you can get past the offensive material."

","I have this interview of Kubrick and he said something interesting about'Clockwork' and censhorship.Here's an Excerpt  from the interview: Kubrick: There is no positive evidence that violence in films or television causes social violence. To focus one's interest on this aspect of violence is to ignore the principal causes, which I would list as:<br/><br/>1. Original sin: the religious view. 2. Unjust economic exploitation: the Marxist view. 3. Emotional and psychological frustration: the psychological view.<br/><br/>4. Genetic factors based on the 'Y' chromosome theory: the biological view.<br/><br/>5. Man, the killer ape: the evolutionary view. To try to fasten any responsibility on art as the cause of life seems to me to put the case the wrong way around. Art consists of reshaping life but it does not create life, nor cause life. Furthermore to attribute powerful suggestive qualities to a film is at odds with the scientifically accepted view that, even after deep hypnosis, in a posthypnotic state, people cannot be made to do things which are at odds with their natures.<br/><br/>
Is there any kind of violence in films which you might regard as socially dangerous? <br/><br/>SK:Well, I don't accept that there is a connection, but let us hypothetically say that there might be one. If there were one, I should say that the kind of violence that might cause some impulse to emulate it is the 'fun' kind of violence: the kind of violence we see in the Bond films, or in Tom and Jerry cartoons. Unrealistic violence, sanitized violence, violence presented as a joke. This is the only kind of violence that could conceivably cause anyone to wish to copy it, but I am quite convinced that not even this has any effect. There may even be an argument in support of saying that any kind of violence in films, in fact, serves a useful social purpose by allowing people a means of vicariously freeing themselves from the pent up, aggressive, aggressive emotions which are better expressed in dreams, or in the dreamlike state of watching a film, than in any form of reality or sublimation.<br/><br/>
Isn't the assumption of your audience in the case of Clockwork Orange likely to be that you support Alex's point of view and in some way assume responsibility for it? <br/><br/>SK:I don't think that any work of art has a responsibility to be anything but a work of art. There obviously is a considerable controversy, just as there always has been, about what is a work of art, and I should be the last to try to define that. I was amused by Cocteau's Orpheé when the poet is given the advice: 'Astonish me'. The Johnsonian definition of a work of art is also meaningful to me, and that is that a work of art must either make life more enjoyable or more endurable. Another quality, which I think forms part of the definition, is that a work of art is always exhilarating and never depressing, whatever its subject matter may be. <br/><br/>In view of the particular exhilaration of Alex's religious fantasies, has the film run into trouble with clerical critics? <br/><br/>SK:The reaction of the religious press has been mixed, although a number of superb reviews have been written. One of the most perceptive reviews by the religious press, or any other press, appeared in The Catholic News written by John E. Fitzgerald, and I would like to quote one portion of it:<br/><br/>""In print we've been told (in B. F. Skinner's Beyond Freedom and Dignity) that man is but a grab-bag of conditioned reflexes. On screen with images rather than words, Stanley Kubrick shows that man is more than a mere product of heredity and/or environment. For as Alex's clergyman friend (a character who starts out as a fire-and-brimstone-spouting buffoon but ends up the spokesman for the film's thesis) says: ""When a man cannot choose, he ceases to be a man. ""The film seems to say that to take away a man's choice is not to redeem him but merely to restrain him: otherwise we have a society of oranges, organic but operating like clock-work. Such brainwashing, organic and psychological, is a weapon that totalitarians in state, church, or society might wish for an easier good even at the cost of individual rights and dignity. Redemption is a complicated thing and change must be motivated from within rather than imposed from without if moral values are to be upheld. But Kubrick is an artist rather than a moralist and he leaves it to us to figure what's wrong and why, what should be done and how it should be accomplished."" 8/10"

","WARNING: SOME SPOILERS ARE PRESENT IN THIS REVIEW<br/><br/>Stanely Kubrick's undisputed masterpiece is an eye-popping extraordinare.<br/><br/>Kubrick's point here is a strike against a society filled with sex and violence.  He was ahead of his time, as this whole film is.  He fights fire with fire for shocks with a plentiful amount of the two.<br/><br/>
His poster child for the dark subject is a misfit punk named Alex.  He goes out at night on sprees of violence and rape with his ""droogs"" who follow him.  On one particular night out, they rape and kill a man's wife right in front of his eyes.<br/><br/>Alex's ""droogs"" are very attatched to him.  He doesn't treat him as equals at all, in fact, he hurts them.<br/><br/>This very much symbolizes a society that chooses to follow in a dark past that will later come back to haunt them.<br/><br/>Alex is eventually caught and sent into a special correctional facility where he will be a guiney pig for a new experiment in justice to criminals. This experiment is complicated, but seems it will be effective.  It has Alex watching, over and over again, very violent films that are similar to the sprees he used to go on.  He is eventually very disturbed and soon becomes ill when he gets cravings to pursue his activities of old.<br/><br/>
This may seem like a good way in stopping criminals, but it turns out to be ineffective.  This is a way of showing that sex and violence is a problem in society that will never be fixed.<br/><br/>There will be people on both sides of the subject. This is shown through the man whose wife was victimized in front of his eyes.  Later in the film, Alex goes back to his home and is unrecognized because the former time he was wearing a mask.  The man finds out that he has been, in a way, tortured by law enforcement.  He nurtures Alex out of pity, but later changes sides when he figures out the whole story.<br/><br/>Kubrick masterfully depicts the subject he has in many, many ways. The final shot of the film shows two women having sex and there are photographers lined up, taking pictures of them.<br/><br/>The film is filled with a lot of woderful, extra things to admire. First off, there is an original use of made-up dialect that comes straight from the Burgess novel. I had to watch the DVD with subtitles on, just to catch everything.  The cinematography is gorgeous as well.<br/><br/>This is a largely groundbreaking film and one of the most accomplished works of Stanely Kubrick.<br/><br/>I must caution, however, that this film is extremely violent.  It is very disturbing and unsettling and definately not for all tastes.  It was made back in 1971, but still remains grotesque (even by today's standards).<br/><br/>Kubrick's way of combatting sex and violence is brutal, but ultimately effective.  It is hard to stomach, but is a brave, powerful and important film.<br/><br/>This film was extremely controversial when it was released.  It was banned in Brittain and given an ""X"" rating in America.  It was a film that helped pave a new path in filmmaking.  It is one of the films that would shape cinema forever.  Definately one of the very best movies I've ever seen."

","I finally saw this film after being afraid of seeing it for so long. Kubrick's films always do this to me. They make me feel conflicting emotions. I think that is why so many people having opposing views of his works. In 2001 I felt both confused and intrigued. In this film I felt both repulsed and excited. I could not decide if I should like the protagonist Alex or not. Looking back on the movie now, he was the most likable character because at least he was being honest about his shadiness unlike everyone else (except for the church guy). The movie images are imprinted in my brain and that good because now I can think about the film for the rest of the week. I think that is why I like Kubrick. He made movies that I actually want to talk about afterwards with my friends and people who have good judgment. He made movies that are worth discussion and not just another formulated piece. He's almost like Socrates in that he pushes your button and makes you think out of your ordinary mode of thinking. Well this movie is definitely not for everyone...I would not recommend it to my grandma. But as the movie nailed into our heads...its all about having choices in life. Overall I give it 9/10."

","1st watched 8/10/2002 - 8 out of 10(Dir-Stanley Kubrick): Strange futuristic story of a ""ultra"" violent gang whose leader goes to jail and is rehabilitated by the government.  His rehabilitation is basically just to make him sick whenever he is about to be violent or have sex. They also made a little mistake in making him sick as well whenever he hears his favorite piece of music(Beethoven's 9th).  There is much controversy about the lewdness of the sexual perversions and the violent beatings that happen in the first half hour of the movie and this is about all we hear from the public, but the movie really becomes interesting after he's caught(at this point the perversion and most of the violence stops.)  The rest of the movie is a sometimes funny, very sarcastic look at how criminals are treated and how our government and ourselves react to varied things like the media and the fate of those who have murdered. There is so much discussion that can follow after this movie ends and I believe that's where Kubrick is when he's at his best.  Just like in ""2001;A Space Odyssey""  again he has pricked our minds and our senses to a strange, comic, dark, play on our soceity and given us much to think  about and much to learn from as we look at our present human condition."

Whilst that is a very basic explaination, the film raises moral and ethical questions within law enforcement.<br/><br/>Another aspect of the film to be commented on is the artistic beauty.  Each scene is like a work of art - perfectly choreographed with brilliant costumes and colours.

","The main flaw of the film, and this is not to say that the film is rubbish but quite the opposite, is that the violence within Clockwork Orange is necessary but yet too much.  Now I'm not some `bleeding heart` activist who wants all violence to be banned on the silver screen and for us to live in perfect harmony, but I feel that the scenes of violence only helped to distort the bare bones of a truly great movie idea.<br/><br/>My reasoning is this:  the director and his script had one true aim, which is to highlight the importance of the facet of violence as one of our key indicators of our ability to choose our actions in life.  The film gives us a great distinction of the moral sides to DeLarge's action but craftily sits on the fence and allows us to choose.  But the violent scenes only helped to blur its aims before any of us have a chance to view the film.  The controversy that surrounds this film due to the scenes of violence only secured the notion that your attention will be firmly fixed to gauging your opinion on it.  How many people will come out of the theatre or switch off the video at home and comment on how horrid/crap the violence was, and not see the true intentions of Clockwork Orange.  Some people, I know, have gone further: the violent scenes being imitated in real life only goes to show that many will be attracted to this film for purely different images as to what Kubrick wished us to see.<br/><br/>But this is where the problem occurs when tackling a subject like this. Kubrick states that violence is a necessity of life but I'm sure would never have thought that the images he produced could distort what he wished as much as it has.  If the violent scenes were handled in a less direct, dramatic matter (but still using the excellent music and visual projections) that are produced in a way which conveyed the idea but did not glorify the act itself, this film will be easily one of the true greats for the majority of people.  The format is arrives to us though means that it is a truly great film for those who choose to view past its controversy and infamy. For the others, it is a film which is violent and controversial and when they pass the violence and the controversy, fail to give the film is proper respect."

","I would include ""Clockwork Orange"" with ""Full Metal Jacket"", and ""The Shining"" as the all time greats by Stanley Kubrick.  ""Clockwork Orange"" has everything, a little bit of nudity, a little bit of sex (`the old in out, in out'), a little bit of violence, and a little bit of psychotherapy.  Alex (Malcolm McDowell) and his teenage chums do a little of the ultra violence, until they decide to betray Alex, leaving him to be caught and sent to jail for the death of a woman.  While in prison he is able to fool the jail preacher and a government official.  The government official comes to the prison to find some one to be chosen for a scientific study.  While the study takes place, Alex finds himself sickened when violence or rape would happen.  But when Alex is released into the troubled world, he runs into past victims.  Then he finds himself a victim and is almost killed because of what the government did to him. The first time I watched ""Clockwork Orange"", I fell asleep, but after that I found myself to enjoy it!  But I still can't figure out if Stanley Kubrick wants us to love or hate Alex, you have to love Kubrick for this idea. This movie had everything, but Alex finding a real love and because there was no `love' scene I would rate this movie a 9 out of 10 stars, because no movie needs a true love, just `the old in out, in out.'"

","""2001: A Space Odyssey"" marked the beginning of Stanley Kubrick's new filmmaking style, which relied more on a spectacular use of color and shot composition as well as the use of classical music and electronic scores. ""A Clockwork Orange"", considered by many to be his most morally ambiguous feature, might be the ultimate example of this new style of filmmaking which Kubrick would continue to utilize for the rest of his career.  The film is so uniquely colorful and innovatively designed that, regardless of whatever deeper meanings it might contain, the film is incredibly fascinating to watch.  In fact, this film is quite original in every aspect, from the ""Nadsat"" dialogue, to the innovative camera angles.<br/><br/>Many have criticized the film, claiming that in encourages violence, which is entirely false.  The first several scenes with the movie's main character, Alex, assaulting random people without the slightest hint of morality has the ability to offend people quite easily.  What many fail to realize, however, is that these scenes are meant to be viewed through Alex's sadistic mind.  The beautiful classical music in the background and the stylized rhythm helps to show Alex's perspective of his crimes.<br/><br/>Alex is a walking definition of a psychotic.  He lacks a sense of morals, takes delight in establishing dominance over others (including his own gang), shows fearlessness (his ""King of the Road"" game helps to demonstrate this), and finds himself unable to control his impulses.  He also has a charming and manipulative personality, as most psychotics do.  Alex is charismatic enough to make us like him, but we also loathe him and his horrifying actions throughout the first half of the film.  Towards the second half of the film, in which Alex is left helpless by the government to defend himself, we actually feel sorry for this cruel, unmerciful human scum.<br/><br/>Some people fail to recognize the satire throughout ""A Clockwork Orange"". The government's attempts at rehabilitating criminals, which consists of nothing more than taking away his ability to choose, is one of the focuses. Also note that, when Alex is released from prison with the inability to commit evil deeds, the members of society which he wronged before take their revenge on him.  They beat him and torture him, which shows that society has the tendency to be just as deranged as Alex.  One man, Mr. Alexander, who's wife is dead as a result of Alex's criminal behavior, has become even more psychotic and sadistic than Alex.  The hypocrisy of society is shown brilliantly throughout the film.<br/><br/>It seems that everyone in ""A Clockwork Orange"" is evil.  Alex and his gang, his victims, the scientists who invented the ""Ludivico treatment"" used on Alex, the prison inmates (obviously), and the government that forms an alliance with Alex at the end of the film in an attempt to pin the experiment's failure on the scientists and some of the individual members of society.  The only good, moral character to be found is the prison chaplin, who is gullible enough to fall for Alex's sucking up, and who is caring and perceptive enough to tell that the Ludivico treatment will take away Alex's choice to be a human being, thus making him a clockwork orange.<br/><br/>What is ""A Clockwork Orange"" really about?  There are several interpretations.  I see the film as an examination of criminals as well as what we can do with them.  As prison's become increasingly overcrowded, we find that there's nothing that can be done with them.  The government first tries to take away his ability to do bad deeds, but, after that attempt misfires, they put him in a position of power.  The sad truth is, psychotics are often the ones put into major positions in society.  Perhaps that's why our world in such miserable shape.<br/><br/>But even if you're not in the mood for thinking, just enjoy the film for the amazing combination of visuals and music.  Admire the brilliant and unforgettable compositions.  There are two great, lengthy shots which come to mind.  The first, in which Alex has been caught by the police, has his social worker, Mr. Deltoid gleefully looking telling him his most recent victim has died.  Deltoid, the inspector, and the policeman all look directly into the camera, a shot from Alex's point of view.  Another memorable moment is a slow zoom-out, beginning with a close-up of Mr. Alexander listening to Alex scream for mercy as he's tormented by the Beethoven music he's conditioned to be revolted by.  It slowly zooms-out to observe the stoic reactions of the other people in the room, while keeping the focus on the demented Alexander.  Pure genius."

","No one makes movie like Kubrick. He was probably the only filmmaker to establish a way of making movies that no one will ever achieve again, as hard as they try. A proof of that is this movie - which could have probably fallen into the pit of the ridiculous in someone else's hands, but which gets a treatment by a master director and deserves its place among the best movies of all time. This is not an easy one to watch - from the first shot we feel like we're being tested, like the movie is observing us, right from that lunatic stare of Malcolm McDowell's master creation, Alex. The film that follows is something rarely seen afterwards: a depiction of a psychopathic character which starts paying the dividends of his own way of living. Technically the movie is one of the most exquisite items ever put on film: the sets, the framing, the cinematography, all are top-notch. The usage of classical music is also a landmark, as the scenes only make sense with them, and gives some sequences a ballet-like feel that makes them something more than just violence. Altogether, this movie is shocking but for all the right reasons. Guaranteed to make you never forget about it."

Anyway, I am coming to appreciate this movie a lot more now for its depth and the themes of free will vs. society, passion vs. control, etc.  The political element is more clear to me now, and I think I understand the last shot a lot better."

","a timeless classic from the greatest director we will ever see. if you didn't like this movie, then you didnt get. this movie gets better everytime i see it. its almost as if this movie is a clinic in itself of how to make a movie classic. if there was ever a film that deserved to sweep the oscars, this is it. kubrick was robbed, mcdowell was robbed and every one else who was a part of this crew was robbed. brilliant set designs, perfect performances all around and the over-the-top imagery make this my pick for best movie ever. i can not find a single fault in this entire movie. it captivates you from the opening frame and keeps your attention till the closing credits, and the story still holds up 30 years later. the score still has a semi-futuristic tone adds so much to the tone of the film and kubrick again uses music so brilliantly set to action in his follow-up to 2001. never has music been used so perfectly in a movie. malcolm mcdowell puts in a performance so perfect that you believe this is the role he was born to play. every supporting member of the cast plays their roles so well you believe they really are their characters. (especially warren clarke in the underrated role of dim). this is also probably the most faithful adaption of a book ever brought to screen. the camera work is amazing throughout the film, especially in the sequence in alex's room. not only that, this movie is so amazing on all levels that it even achieves the feat of perverting what may the most harmless tune of ""singing in the rain."" there is so much in every frame of the movie that mutliple viewings are required just to catch all of kubrick's little subtleties. so brilliant in fact, that no one else could have made this film. this is one of only a handful of movies that deserves a bi-weekly viewing and like any true classic, this movie will never go out of style."

","When I first saw this film at the cinema I came out feeling I'd got my money's worth. Not only had I been entertained but A Clockwork Orange had really given me a lot to think about.<br/><br/>I am reluctant to give away too many details about this film. I am sure that a lot of people know the basic story but watch for yourself and you will be watching a cinematic masterpiece. It is very violent at times and very disturbing and I wouldn't recommend it as a film to watch if you're going on a date.<br/><br/>(SPOILERS AHEAD)It is a film that really makes you think. Malcom McDowell plays perhaps one of his best parts as Alex, the leader of a psychotic gang who go round committing heinous acts such as sexual assault, murder and violence. In the middle of the film Alex is sent to prison and is subjected to a radical new treatment which rids him of any violent or sexual urges. He leaves prison and finds he cannot integrate into the world he left. He also feels sick whenever he tries to engage in any violent or sexual acts.<br/><br/>This is one of those rare films that can be enjoyed by viewers but can also give them something to think about. When Alex leaves prison he cannot do what he wants.The treatment he endured in prison has robbed him of one very important thing-freedom. Violence and sexual assault may be wrong and cannot be justified but I think this film is saying that in life people should have the freedom to do what they want-even if it is bad. If a person cannot do what they want-however bad it may be-then really they are not a person. Their humanity is gone and they are reduced to the level of a robot in society. I guess the film is saying that true freedom is being able to choose what you do in life-no matter whether it is good,bad or indifferent.<br/><br/>That was my interpretation when I saw the film many years ago. I don't usually analyze a film in the way I have for this movie but it certainly is an intriguing movie. Highly recommended."

","Sick?  Insane?  Twisted?  Genius.  All of the following words describe the Stanley Kubrick directed film ""Clockwork Orange,"" the same film which introduced Malcolm McDowell to the world - for that +alone+ the film viewing public can be grateful.  His portrayal of the hoodlum Alexander DeLarge (a young man whose principle interests are rap, ultraviolence, and Beethoven) is both powerful and disturbing.  Simple minded Congresspersons and civil servants would like to no doubt blame the sick sad world we live in on films such as these; when in fact films like this are the magnifying glass through which society's ills are exposed to harsh light.  Alex's own corrections officer is confounded - he has a good home, two parents, something of a brain on his head - why is he such a terror?  There's no easy answer; and that rings just as true when you ask why Columbine High or why Oklahoma City.  There's no one source, no one reason, and sometimes bad actions really can't be quantified.  The film's solution to the Alex ""problem"" is both horrific and draconian: cure the ill by making the patient ill from the cure.<br/><br/>This film is great on many levels - social commentary, cinematogrophy, even the choice of soundtrack will strike a chord that will raise the hairs on the back of your neck.  To not see this film once in your life, even as disturbing as it may be, is to do yourself a grave injustice."

Alex went to prison, with somewhat of a mental illness, and he was getting an ego trip on power and control with his little gang. When he went to prison, he acted as if he really did want to better himself, he did with the treatment program. He then went back into society, treating him as if he's still the old Alex. It shows how criminals are treated today, they go into society with their rehabbed story, and no one believes them, and chews them up, and spits them out. It's a great way of showing that. It also shows how insane one person can be. It's brilliant, but yet bizzare. Plus the Beethoven and that other crap got on my nerves after awhile, how much can a movie have ?"

","I want to add a few things to what I said in my first post. First of all, as I understand it Stanley Kubrick didn't even know that there was 21 chapters in Anthony Burgess' book. For various reasons (some of them conflicting) the American version had only 20 chapters, leaving out Alex's self-determined change for the better. Only in the latest American printing is the 21st chapter included. Anthony Burgess himself said at one point that Kubrick didn't know about it. And the book is excellent as well, by the way, and Burgess does deserve recognition for the book that is his own personal masterpiece, even if he didn't think so. May Kubrick and Burgess *both* be remembered for the definitive thesis on freedom and human nature that is ""A Clockwork Orange."""
"Mike Sh.","Null","0","0","6 June 1999"," A philosophical film
","At first glance, this film may seem like a sick deranged piece of trash shamelessly designed to appeal to our most prurient tastes.  Indeed, one of the most disturbing things about this film is that since the viewer is looking through Alex's eyes, there is sometimes a tendency for the viewer to relish the violence as much as Alex does - to laugh along with him as he commits his mayhem. (Yikes!)<br/><br/>Two questions come out of this: Why is Alex made as repulsive as he is? And why is the violence portrayed in such a shockingly graphic manner?  (In the book, Alex is loathsome enough, but the brutality is cloaked somewhat in the ""nadsat"" or teen language, based largely on Slavic roots, that Alex uses to tell his story.)  The answer to both of these questions is, I think, that Kubrick (and Burgess) wanted to make the point that no one deserves the inhuman conditioning that Alex went through - not even the cruelest most bestial slime (like Alex).  Thus, despite the shocking sensationalistic sex and violence, it can honestly be said that this film is... a philosophical work."

I've never understood why people are so squeamish about seeing play-pretend violence being acted out (excuse me, its not real!) but to each his own. If you're one of those people, well, you've missed out on one of the best films ever made. Kubrick's ability to etch both images and sounds into the viewers mind is probably without comparison.

I would advise anyone who enjoyed the film to read the book as it is brilliantly executed. Anyway, although I'm not one of those ""books are better than films"" brigade, I feel there are some points which need to be stressed. Many people give all the credit for this film to the late Stanley Kubrick. However, at least 70% of the film is Burgesses creation. Kubrick's visual genius was an integral part of this movie, for example, the Droogs costumes are of his specification, not Burgess's, as was his modification of the storyline, the hilarious scene where Alex describes what he sees on the cards to the immensely patronising woman was completely different in the book. Despite this, Burgess devised the entire plot, and the Russian based teen language ""Nadsat"". All I'm saying is that perhaps Kubrick has been given too much credit for Burgess's masterpiece."

The one sad thing about it was that gangs in England and USA started using the language used and by that put coal under the movie-violence question. I think that this is the second best movie made by Kubrik - ""Full Metal Jacket"" being number one. There is an other thing about this movie I'd like to point out and that is the music that is used. For the most part it is classics like Beethoven and Mozart which really added to the sensation and without it the movie would be just half as good."

","A Clockwork Orange has achieved something of a reputation since it was first released 27 years ago. It was withdrawn shortly after its first screening in the UK amid reports that gangs were copying the violence featured in the film, and to this day it is still unofficially banned in this country. Possessing a copy alone is a criminal offence. This is a great shame, because it really is superb film.<br/><br/>It tells the story of Alex, the leader of vicious street gang the Droogs. His idea of a good time is a bit of `the old ultra-violence' accompanied by Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. When he kills a woman whilst attempting to rape her, his gang deserts him and he is prosecuted for murder. Faced with the prospect of spending the rest of his life in prison, he jumps at the chance to be a test subject for a new method of rehabilitation which could see him a free man in days. But at what cost?<br/><br/>Although it was very violent for its day (1971), A Clockwork Orange is not nearly as disturbing or explicit as Crash or Natural Born Killers, often because here the music is incongruous enough to make the scene more surreal. For example, a man is kicked to within an inch of his life as Alex sings `Singin' In The Rain'. The point of the film is highly subversive, that the government is even more brutal than Alex himself, but this was lost on many people who could not see past the adult content of the film in the first place. It is a brilliantly produced piece of work, with the design particularly outstanding: the fact that the concrete and rural locations are not dressed at all to match the sterile futurism of the sets e.g. the Korova milk-bar, with its total lack of colour.<br/><br/>This is, in short, an outstanding film, far outstripping Kubrick's other alleged `masterpieces', like the totally unfunny Dr. Strangelove or the exercise in utter tediousness that is The Shining. Now that this genius of the silver screen has passed on leaving Eyes Wide Shut as his legacy to critics and fans alike, it seems that his incandescent brilliance in this film will never be contested.

The populace would try to protect itself, in this case with a bodyguard, instead of try to discover and eliminate the root causes of crime.

","Stanley did it again.<br/><br/>Again I am commenting on kubrick's work, to be quite honest before I heard of the movie I never knew of Stanley kubrick, I read the book, and then my teacher had the poster up, and that's what brought me here today.<br/><br/>The first time I tried to watch the movie, it was a year after I read the book, I saw it on video, and to be perfectly honest, I was expecting too much, and I got 90 percent of this perfection, it was more than beautiful, but not for it's time.<br/><br/>The book was written when they first landed on the moon, and there we were watching Anthony burgesses masterpiece come to life.   Well most people think its only sticking to the society illness, but I disagree, it is purely showing, Truth and Alex's truth was sadism, it brought him peace, it brought him pleasure, and so it is his truth, and he always keeps his violent ways, even when they try to break his sadist ways, he must die to suppress his truth, but he succeeded on winning against politicians.<br/><br/>The movie also talks, about the idea, that `when we sent some one to a prison, are we curing him and if so, for what reason' he was defiantly not fixed up after the lodvico technique, and did the technique help the families he harmed, did it? Hell no, and it is shown when he goes to the writer's house, he is not in peace but only more pain, when he finds `ALEX'. It is also having the effect of ken kesny's coo coo's nest, being anti everything, `who is the good guy' not Alex, the rapist, not the politicians, they don't care about the victims, only for them selves, not the victims, the victims whom will need sadism to feel joy, and will enjoy the murderers death.  It has another theme, the theme of curing society, it used 2 ways, one is Alex, he was `cured' or as he acted like it, and when that didn't work, they tried bringing the rapists, on their side, which is what people call a coupe de tat, they suppress the innocent by making the murderers, police officers, they still do what they used to do, beat whomever, but now it's legal, which is the symbolism, when their suits are white and look like army uniforms, it is symbol for understand human nature, hate brutality and sadism.<br/><br/>My favorite film, not the best but my favorite, I love the book and the movie; it was symbolic, inside the movie theater and outside.>"

","Alex, played by Malcom McDowell, and his friends roam the nights of London doing anything they want. Beating up whoever makes them angry, getting into fights with other gangs, drives in the middle of a 2 lane road, rapes who ever is naive enough, drinks milk drugs(in Nadsat, the langugue spoke in the movie and book, synthemec, drencrum, and velloset all mean drugs) and finishes his night off with Ludwig Van Beethoven. The police can never catch them or find out who did it, so there are many people doing it. Alex is brought up in the worst society imaginable. His doesn't have screwed up morales, he knows what he is doing is wrong. But he just has pleasure out of other's suffering. His only escape from everything else is Ludwig Van and the Ninth symphony. He think of the strangest thought while listening to it. But what is strange is that when he is imagining all these strange thoughts, there is a shot of, what is now, old televison. But it wouldn't make sense to have it in the future, right? Could A Clockwork Orange be an alternate history of the present instead of a horrible future to look forward to?<br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick changed many things in the book. Kubrick did take out some signifigant things from the book, such as why it is called ""A Clockwork Orange"". He also changed some things, such as instead of watching Japanese get decapitated and the effects of the WW2 a-bomb during the ""treatment"", he was watching Nazis making violence. But some dialoge is word for word between the book and movie. Kubrick did an awfully good job writing a screenplay for this movie. Such a the famous beginning zoom out of the Korova milk bar, and the shots of Alex's head during the treatment while he is begging the to stop the movie. My opinion is this movie should have won at least the Academy AwardÂ®  for music and costumes.<br/><br/>What can be very strange about this is that it looks so much fun to do you want to try it yourself. That is maybe why it not a good idea for someone to see it when they are young. This movie also attractes many music punks and skin-heads, like ""Taxi Driver"" does. There is a song by a band called The Choice which made a song about this movie called ""Alex"". Some lyric in the song are: ""Oh Alex, Oh Alex, I'm a lot like you"", ""I'm so sick of all the silence, I just want my ultra-violence"" and ""Singing in the rain for all my droogs to hear"". They, these punks and others, interprite the movie so much differently, they only like the beginning of it when the gang rapes and beats people.<br/><br/>Nadsat is also an important part of the book and movie. It gives it a interesting twist. The sentences sound very different. For example, the sentence "" A nozh scrap anytime you say."" It sounds different than ""I'll have a knife fight whenever you want."" Though the book has a lot more Nadsat in it.<br/><br/>So for all of those who think this is just a science fiction violent movie, why don't you sit down and analyze it. Shot by shot."

The woman gets irritated with him, and grabs a bust of Beethoven (I'm not sure if it's Ludwig van, it may be Mozart or somebody, but for argument's sake) and attacks him with it. He then grabs the sculpture of an over-sized penis to fend her off. The imagery! The society woman attacks him with Beethoven, he defends himself with a penis!

Of course many of their interpretations are valid, some of which are even profound. However in my opinion, they have missed the point. This is not ""1984"" or ""Faust"" for crying out loud. The filmmaker's real intention is just to shock and disturb with graphic depictions of the ugliness and grotesqueness of the primal animal instincts of human nature. And on that alone, Kubrick succeeded brilliantly and gives the film a legitimate claim to being the best movie ever made. As for the message, if there is one, it's not important and who cares. It is just an ultra-violent movie made some thirty years ago when the moviegoers were still watching ""The Sound of Music"" and ""My Fair Lady"". Surprisingly thirty years later, it has not aged that much and still retained much of its shock value. Now folks, forget about the message and just enjoy the movie for what it is and be shocked and disturbed.<br/><br/>A true ass kicker and arguably the best movie ever made.

I found the clergyman's points about free will and the nature of 'good' to be fascinating, but they were just fleeting flicks of dialogue. The ambiguity of the ending was also unsatisfying...was he still a pawn or was he regaining his freedom?

","A Clockwork Orange is one of the most disturbing, yet interesting pieces of film ever to come out of the mind of Stanley Kubrick.  Here he shows us a society that is overrun with street punks, and they pretty much rule the night.  As we go along with Alex and his Droogs on their nightly missions that include rape, gang fights, home invasion and car stealing we are repelled by the violence and horror that these men cause, but at the same time we are pulled in by the charm that Alex seems to generate.  When he is caught and sent to prison, we sympathize with him.  Then when his free will is taken away, we sympathize with him even more.  Very strange considering this was a man who liked rape and violence.  Kubrick's main theme in the movie is free will.  Once free will is taken away, you are no longer a man. When Alex regains his free will at the end, we revel in his victory.  What an image to show the return of Alex's free will.  Him and a naked woman writhing around in a tub while people dressed in early 19th century clap and the end of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony plays.  If nothing else, Kubrick sure knows how to pick images."

","Minor spoilers.<br/><br/>One of the few films that I have thought worthy after reading the book first.  It is undoubtably due to Kubrick's faithful adaption of the sui generis novel by Anthony Burgess.  Upon recently completing Dickens' Oliver Twist, I was struck by the many similarities between that work and Burgess' depraved book.  Separated by over 100 years, they both use the streets of London for their scrofulous settings.  Both authors use violence and clever street argot to enhance their stories.  Both use youth as a vehicle to study corruption.<br/><br/>Kubrick keeps true to his inspiration's synchronic testament by avoiding the cause of profligacy, and instead dwelling on its effect. The dystopian world in Clockwork attempts to thwart immorality through science.  This method precludes the proclivity toward recidivism, but thrusts on society the transgression of dehumanizing part of its populace.<br/><br/>The film's terminus ad quem leads us to an invidious reality that evil must co-exist with humanity.  This is presented ominously and darkly.  But it is a fitting ending to a disquieting story.<br/><br/>WARNING!!! I very seldom caution anyone from viewing a film, but the wanton violence and a despicable rape scene may be better left unwatched by the squeamish or impressionable."

","A CLOCKWORK ORANGE is one of Stanley Kubrick's most famous films.  I feel it is tremendously flawed.  It starts off beautifully, a tale of a frightening futuristic street gang led by the twisted Alex (Malcolm McDowell) The shooting is inventive (Hey, it's Kubrick) You'll want to memorize the rapid fire dialog, made up of mostly bizarre street slang.  The music is beyond clever (""The Thieving MagPie"" plays during a gang-fight.  You have to love it!) After commiting several serious brutal crimes, the police catch Alex. When an authority figure says to Alex ""Your (latest) victim has died..."", the film begins to fall apart.  The jokes become cheaper, the acting way too forced (Sometimes the actors seem to be waiting for Stanley to say ""Cut"") <br/><br/>
One of the reasons could be that Kubrick just came off the aborted NAPOLEON project in 1970, and was looking for an alternate film.  According to some of the writings on Kubrick, very little time was spent on preparing CLOCKWORK ORANGE.  <br/><br/>But, even flawed Kubrick is much better than the average stuff out there."

Alex reads the first page before he rapes the guy's wife. The book is about the negative consequences of imposing human law and order onto the natural self. Alex later, in the book, spouts off a similar rant.<br/><br/>The movie and book are an argument for man's inherent evilness. It's an argument against the popular liberal enlightenment idea that man is born inherently good, and evil only later results as an effect of corrupt governments. <br/><br/>Alex no longer can commit evil in the end - though he can still will it - but he also has a breakdown and random hallucinations - he is not ""cured"" according to Burgess. According to Burgess, humans cannot be cured of evilness because it is a part of their authentic self. Rid yourself of evil, and rid yourself of yourself. <br/><br/>SPOILERS END, point of interest: I was quite surprised when I learned that the girl Billyboy and his gang almost raped and the two girls Alex has sex with were all only ten years old! - in the book that is. Also, the latter two girls are not as willing as the movie makes it seem. Really, Alex rapes them. He leaves them ""bruised"" and fighting him off with ""punchipunchies."""

","Stanley Kubrick has made a career out of doing novel-based movies that are later disavowed by their authors. His repertoire includes 'Lolita', 'The Shining', and Anthony Burgess' 'A clockwork orange'.  As a catholic, Burgess could not accept the fact that this film is the clean adaption of what he himself wrote. That between his sugarcoated words he had hidden images of very brutal violence and terror. Still, for those of us who aren't inhibited by religion, this film sports the same weighty blow as the novel. It seamlessly transfers Burgess' experimental  use of language to the big screen, and actor Malcolm McDowell is incredible as Alex, combining his hideously evil grin with the adolescent need for fun. Lovers of the novel will not be disappointed by Kubrick's adaption, as it goes just as far in the search for free will as Burgess did, and as it keeps the nuances that made the book so fantastic in the first place."

Then horror of horrors, Kubrick ordered its withdrawal from UK cinemas , not for the gangs of youths roaming British streets dressed as their Clockwork 'heroes' but because of death threats he received. Now with his passing , it is back , looking slightly dated but still with the ability to shock. I remember friends that liked the 'first half' but were totally bored by the 'second half' without realising that this second half showed the after effects and retribution to the violence that had gone before. The imagery of this film with its excellent soundtrack are not to be missed , it is a classic but only if you realise the message it conveys. The possible spoiler is the newspaper reports that Alex reads in the hospital where (if I remember rightly) his name is given as Alex Burgess instead of Delarge, gossip is that instead of outfitting Alex and the Droogs as per the book Kubrick reportedly came across a group of strangely dressed youths in Coventry UK and adopted their attire for the film. 10/10"

I recently just started watching Stanley Kubrick's films, in fact, i recently just started to watch all the classics.  I must say, of the work of his that I have seen, A Clockwork Orange, is his most daring and best film.  Watching not only Kubrick's films, but Spielberg's and Hitchcock's films, I have seen and realized the reason I have always wanted to be a director.  So, I definetly recommend A Clockwork Orange.

","Stanley Kubrick's film of ""A Clockwork Orange"" is quite possibly the most apalling, sadistic, disgusting movie ever made.  At the same time, it is also an intense, meticulously crafted, creative masterpiece.  It is difficult to admit in our society that this film is a masterpiece because it's main character, a psychotic criminal that routinely exercises in rape, violence and Beethoven, can encounter injustice from a social group that we support and trust... government.  Although 'Alex' (the main character) perform disturbing criminal acts, what the government did to him in this film was worse.  It is extremely difficult to watch, yet it contains the film makers' brilliant observation of society. It is a film that demands to be seen (several times to be near-completely understood).  Hopefully, the people who have not seen it should try to keep a very open mind while watching this.  Not for the weak-at-heart."

","I am not personally a huge fan of Stanley Kubrick.  I had a hard time sitting through both '2001' and 'Dr.Strangelove'.  All though, I have only seen both of those films once, I didn't feel that there was enough there for me to have multiple viewings.  So when I sat down to watch this film, I wanted to like it, and surprisingly I did.<br/><br/>    First of all, Malcolm McDowell is excellent in this film.  However, Kubrick always gets excellent performances from his actors, and this has never been a problem for me.<br/><br/>    More importantly, the pacing of this film was much quicker than most of his other films.  His other works seem to me to have a deliberately slow pace, but with the exception of about twenty or so minutes in the middle of the film, the pacing was excellent.<br/><br/>    I won't go into the details of the script.  It was very clever and well done, and had a very circular approach to it that I rather enjoyed.  Plus it was very original back when it was made, and holds that originality until today.  It has standout scenes that I will remember for the rest of my life, and that is always the sign of a fantastic film.  Specifically, I will remember an early scene with the use of Malcolm McDowell doing 'Singing in the Rain'.  Very shocking, and it is hard to shock me at this point because I thought I had seen it all.  <br/><br/>    So with memorable scenes, a script that tackles many issues, for instance morality and ethics, just to name a couple, this is a film that you should check out at least once.  It wasn't perfect in my opinion, but if I watch it again I may change my mind.  But still, 9 out of 10."

One night, Alex and his team sneak into a crippled man's home and rape the man's wife.  These scenes are hard to watch, but still are effective.  Also that night they beat an old homeless man nearly to death. This sort of violence is called ""ultra-violence"". Alex is living in his parents' house with a pet snake named Basil, and he is a great fan of Beethoven.  Until one night Alex kills a woman, and goes to prison.  In prison, he is forced to have a special treatment to escape.  This treatment involves opening Alex's eyes and forcing him to watch movies  of rape and violence, thus brainwashing him. After he is out of prison, he returns home only to find out what his friends and family have been doing for the two years he was convicted....<br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick is a genius.  This movie was made in 1971, but it looks like it was made less than 5 years ago.  It's amazing.  Kubrick's vision of the future 30 years ago is more than perfect.  If you watch A Clockwork Orange, think of it as a work of art.  Everything in this film is artistic.  Malcom McDowell is very good in acting, and so are his friends.<br/><br/>I didn't know what section of blockbuster this movie was in, but I found it in Sci-fi.  Could you believe this movie was actually funny at some points? Kubrick's adaption to the novel was a perfect film, and deffinetly his best. If you ask me, I'd say it should have been in the ""Fantasy"" section, because everything in this film came out of a genius's mind, and the technique of brainwashing isn't something that you'd usually find in a Sci-fi movie.  <br/><br/>This movie deffinetly made my top-five of best movies ever made.

","Perhaps the most famous set of false eyelashes in film history. Stanley Kubrick's blackest of comedies, he had the good sense to omit the last chapter of Anthony Burgess' book, leaving the edge on Burgess' savage attack on modern society.<br/><br/>Alex (Malcolm McDowell) is the leader of a small gang of  hoodlums who repeatedly rob, rape, and steal their way across an unnamed and futuristic state. When a robbery culminates in murder, Alex's gang betray him to the police. He is found guilty, and sent to prison. There he volunteers for a mind-washing program in order to be released. Once released he is set upon by his former mates and victims. But the mind-washing has rendered him not just pliable, but helpless.<br/><br/>Filled with beautiful set-piece scenes, the violence of the film, while not terribly explicit by today's standards, is still shocking. The soundtrack by Walter (later Wendy) Carlos is especially effective at making the violence especially repugnant. Part what drives this reaction is that Alex, while a thoroughly corrupt person, becomes even more repugnant once deprived of his own will. His love of Beethoven is crushed and the one redeeming facet of this thoroughly unlikable person is removed.<br/><br/>But the film also succeeds in getting us to root for Alex. Better a willful evil than a slavish good. In the end we cheer his minor triumph. Free will exposes us to evil, but lack of it is not worth the price."

","I assume that just about everyone here has seen both films far too many times to recall so I'll be pretty blunt as to why I think Fight Club (for one) is simply a better movie.<br/><br/>First off, I just want to say that I don't think Fight Club could've been made without Clockwork preceeding it, but I think that when put on equal levels, Fight Club is a much better film.  First off, one of my main problems with Clockwork Orange is that it underestimates the intelligence of the audience by repeating its messages again and again and again.  In 1971, it probably would've fit right in with the time because no one had really seen a movie so extreme but I think that in current times, it's not so uncommon to think the messages of Clockwork (such as the creulty of the government and to find correctional programs hypocratic).  Don't get me wrong, I'm all for extremes, but I think when you look at A Clockwork Orange, it's not all that extreme when viewed next to Fight Club.  The repetition in Clockwork actually has a dull  effect on the over all intensity (sorry about that but it's just the theory of relativity).  I think that if the audience's intelligence wasn't underestimated, the movie could've been made much better.<br/><br/>The fact that Clockwork Orange is still a very good movie is aw inspiring and a sign that it's not completely a trend, but I think that when looked upon as an equal with other movies made, it's hard to say it's the best movie ever made.  I use Fight Club as an example of a better movie because it's in the same psychological category.<br/><br/>As far as raw entertainment, the movie isn't bad at all although some movies still surpass.  To tell you the truth, I still can't get enough of The Fifth Element so I'd have to say that that movie beats it in the entertaining department.<br/><br/>I think #55 spot on the top 250 films is right on the spot.  It's not __too__ strong a movie but it's extremely well made and it gets its point across simply (although I'd personally prefer a more complex ""Usual suspects"" type movie).<br/><br/>So, sit back and enjoy Kubrick's awesome tale of rape, ultra-violence and Beethoven (and don't forget to bask in all the nudity while it still doesn't make you sick)."

I am a big movie buff, despite my lack of Kubrick knowledge, and I knew this film was notorious for it's violence. What I didn't expect was it's startling sense of humor and striking social commentary. Remember when Alex bludgeoned that woman to death with the phallic-shaped sculpture?

"peter_cooper","9","0","0","20 July 2001"," The Most Accurate Social Prophecy in Movie History
","Kubrick has an excellent way of directing films that seem, to me, to be prophecies. A Clockwork Orange is a remarkable film that, 25 years later, is all too relevant in the UK, as bands of thugs who live on faceless estates DO roam the streets fighting and torturing the general public for 'fun'.<br/><br/>Where 2001 was a good look forward into our technological future - it failed socially, we still have no real interest in setting up base on the moon - A Clockwork Orange is a fine look forward into our social future (or present, if you believe the doomsayers).<br/><br/>This is one of those films which requires multiple viewings, as other reviewers have pointed out. The language uses slang well, and Kubrick seems to have realised that language -would- change significantly over the next 20 years after this film was released. He guessed correctly, and even though we don't use the slang that is present in this film, we can relate to it since it is as alien to us as our current slang would be to Alex and his droogs.<br/><br/>The wonderful Moloko 'milk bar' is also an excellent touch. This place seems extremely weird to us, but our new nightclubs and 'raves' would be just as alien to someone in the 70s. All in all, Kubrick has realised that things would change over the years, so he went ahead and made his own guesses.<br/><br/>The interference of the 'State' in all parts of this film is also extremely representative of today's Britain. We lose freedoms in return for supposed 'security', but in fact these securities don't make us feel very secure at all, and in turn it just leads to more thuggery and violence of the sort seen in this film.<br/><br/>There is one snafu, however. The community in the film actually seems closer and friendlier than that of current Britain. For example, the school principal actually seems to care for Alex, despite knowing his history.<br/><br/>All in all, the best social prophecy ever made and, in my opinion, Kubrick's second best film (behind 2001)."
"virek213","9","0","0","20 July 2001"," Is the cure worse than the disease?
","Stanley Kubrick was a director who always had the knack for raising troubling issues, and A CLOCKWORK ORANGE raises some doozies.<br/><br/>Based on Anthony Burgess' controversial 1962 book, the film details the adventures of Alex (Malcolm McDowell), a ""droog"" whose obsessions include rape, ultra-violence and Beethoven (specifically the Ninth Symphony).  After he is caught by police for murder, he spends two years in a British prison before being selected to undergo the Ludovico treatment, designed to cure criminals of their baser impulses.<br/><br/>The problem, however, is that this treatment also saps McDowell of the ability to defend himself against former victims who come seeking revenge. After attempting suicide in the home of a writer he once terrorized, he recovers in a hospital and, in a political ploy of unheard-of proportions, he is restored to health--all his instincts for violence once more intact.<br/><br/>Not surprisingly, Kubrick was heavily criticized for his stylized scenes of sex and violence, which were so disturbing they briefly got the film an 'X' rating; slight trimming by Kubrick bought it down to an 'R'.  But beyond those elements, A CLOCKWORK ORANGE retains its unsettling aura for tackling the issues of crime and punishment, and law and order, which are your basic political code words.  He asks us to ponder the evils of brainwashing.  Is the cure that Alex is being given worse than the disease he has spread?  Do politicians have the right to dictate to people how to behave?  Is the price of free will the predilection of a very small minority to act barbaric?<br/><br/>Accompanied by the music of Beethoven, Rossini, and others, principally in synthesized arrangements by Walter Carlos, those questions are bought forth in A CLOCKWORK ORANGE; and as is typical for Kubrick, he gives us no easy solutions.  For a diatribe against rampant right-wing conservatism, grab-ass politics, and law-and-order jingoism, A CLOCKWORK ORANGE remains extremely effective, and still timely after thirty years."

","Firstly, it may be something of a cliché, but it has to be said: the book is vastly superior to the film, and should ideally be read beforehand. There is the constant danger that the violence and imagery of the movie enthralls to such an extent that the original meaning becomes lost - thus, we end up with psychopaths hailing the film and ignoring its message simply because it is violent and ""against the 'norm'"", and at the opposite end of the spectrum, people becoming so disgusted by the scenes that they do not care if the film has a message or not.<br/><br/>Incidentally, too much fuss is made over the 21st chapter being omitted in the film as in the US version of the book. Included or not, the film still contains the fundamental message (only to a different extent) that choice is a basic right of all human beings - whatever Alex chooses in the end reinforces this. <br/><br/>But I will try not to dwell on the philosophical aspects of the film too much. Entertainment-wise, ""A Clockwork Orange"" is a total gross-out. It's recommended for those who are impassive towards, (or, God forbid, in favour of), ""ultraviolence"". Personally, I think that the violence is exaggerated - the notorious and unnecessary drowning scene leaves you both speechless and wondering, ""How did they do that?""<br/><br/>As far as symbolism goes, there is a lot. It will go straight over the heads of some people - it went over mine, and I am studying this book in English Literature class. Nonetheless, it's enjoyable, but should ONLY be taken seriously if you want to fully consider its moral messages, of which there are plenty. Otherwise, just enjoy it and then forget about it."

","Clockwork Orange is a prime example of why Kubrick is considered one of the best directors ever (my own personal favourite). Having said this, it's definitely not for everyone. Although not terribly graphic by today's standards, it has a psychological potency matched by few films since. There is also a rather prophetic feel to it in its view of future (now present) gang violence that some may find a little too close to the mark to be comfortable with.<br/><br/>Like most Kubrick films, CWO is an intellectually challenging film that leaves the audience feeling a sense of puzzlement as to the meaning of many of its elements. If you only enjoy movies that play down to your level, you will not enjoy it. However, if you like to be challenged to reach upward a little and struggle a bit, even long after the closing credits, you will find it a treat.<br/><br/>Artistically, it has a great deal of that Kubrick style that leaves the viewer with the same feeling that you get after listening to a great piece of music or studying a fine painting.

","This film is quite enjoyable, but Stanley Kubrick did not use the ending of the book, missing author Anthony Burgess' moral entirely.  Whether Kubrick's decision was intentional or not, I don't know.<br/><br/>The origin of the problem springs from Anthony Burgess' New York publisher, who, when the novel was first published in America, decided to edit out the entire remaining chapter of the book.  It is the 21st chapter of the novel, and Burgess has stated numerous times that he intended to have 21 chapters because that is the age of maturity, the birthday when a person is given more privileges for the first time (at least in the 60's, when it was written) than at any other age.<br/><br/><SPOILERS, BOOK AND MOVIE.  I SUGGEST FIRST READING THE BOOK OR AT LEAST THE 21ST CHAPTER BEFORE GOING ON><br/><br/>The 21st chapter begins with Alex sitting in the Korova milkbar again, in the height of fashion (which had no changed from that seen in the beginning of the book and film to a style much more closely resembling that of a skinhead), with a new gang to lead.  He is now the oldest of the gang members, but finds himself growing quite weary of the ""ultraviolent"" lifestyle.  He doesn't participate in the gang's activity, merely gives orders.  He leaves early one night, and starts on his way home.  In the movie, Pete and Dim have become corrupt police officers, but in the novel, Dim is the only one who has.  We don't know what has happened to Pete for most of the book, until the last chapter.  I won't reveal it here (read it!!!), but I will say it is enough to get Alex to begin desiring a family, with a nice wife to come home to, and an infant son.  As the novel's true climax ends, Alex realizes he has matured.<br/><br/>The novel's moral is that the psychological intervention by the government was greatly unnecessary and wrong.  Violent behavior is a thing of youth, Burgess says, and will eventually be overcome by conscience and the transformation from childhood to adulthood.  The incomplete novel and Kubrick's film are both left kind of purposeless, with a moral and an ending much more abrupt and FAR less satisfying than the novel."

","Stanley Kubrick's film adaption of the 1962 novel 'A Clockwork Orange' Has remained in my mind since viewing it for the first time 3 years ago,as one of the most thought provoking,unrelenting and savagely satirical pieces of fiction ever 'Viddied'.An absolute flat out assault on the senses.For many when the novel was first released it's themes were considered as morally inept and it's pornography of violence would be certain to make it unacceptable to any publisher..It's passive statements and exploration of the fact that the novel may be outlining a social prophecy involving the use of aversion therapy to singlehandedly cut down the numbers and  nature of agressive youth was dismissed by many Literary supplement reviewers as a 'nasty little shocker'with nothing more to offer then an invitation to the violent young from an antisocial writer.<br/><br/>But the concept of the story was so much more deep and intense. It is also not only a social prophecy but a study of Free will and mans capacity to choose morally regarding issues that affects his/her life and those around them.It is also a scathing study of Politics/and the dazzling effects of language and music.<br/><br/>in 1971,9 years after the novel first appeared.Kubrick's film smashed onto the screen in nightmarish abundance.Considering the wake of candid pornography that was now exploited artistically in theatre as opposed to the first few years after the novels presentation,The films contents were there to shock morally and not to merely titillate.<br/><br/>Unfortunately a few months after the films initial release,it was withdrawn from Kubrick himself from release in the UK and other countries due to the fact that copycat gangs from the one's depicted in the film were beginning to arise and causing mayhem in the streets of the UK,The film was vowed never to be realeased ever again by Kubrick,until after his death.<br/><br/>Considering the film may have been deemed somewhat 'dated' in my generation (me being 23 oh my brothers)To this day the only irellevance the book and film has to modern society is the description of the clothes Alex and his droogs wear for fillying and shopcrasting,and his 'Horrowshow' kickboots for kicking 'Litsos' in.<br/><br/>Malcolm Mcdowell turns out an ingenious performance as the young hooligan Alex who loves to have a good time,but at the tragic expense of others.We follow the story from his point of view as he governs his droogs (Nadsat for Friends)into all mannerism of tyranny and wrong doing all through to submissive therapy at the hands of a power hungry Political force and his remission back into the society he had once done wrong by as a man who is incapable of making a moral choice.A man who has had his free will stripped from him and all the burdens he created coming back to haunt him.What can be gained from his remission is the question:If man is defined by his capacity to choose between courses of moral action,between good and evil,should he be conditioned only to perform what is believed socially acceptable by others??<br/><br/>The use of language in this film is known as 'Nadsat'(A subliminal soviet-russian teenage slang.)and takes little effort to interpret what the characters are saying,but adds to the brilliance and originality of the story telling.What is the most disturbing aspect is that Alex comes across as such a charasmatic and intelligent citizen,that you wonder shamelessly why he commits the atrocities that he does..<br/><br/>A most amazing film on all counts,Disturbing,profound,surreal,controversial,entertaining and overall,mindblowing...Dont miss it..."

","Anyone who hasn´t seen ""A Clockwork Orange"" misses one of the greatest movies of all times. It´s almost a gap in your education if you don´t know Stanley Kubrick´s masterpiece. This film is like something you´ve never seen before. Made in a pop art style ""A Clockwork Orange"" gives a strange and bizarre impression of the near future: criminals are not punished anymore, they will be healed by killing their violent instincts. In the case of Alex these people became victims themselves, exiles from society...that creates their own monsters and let´s them drop... It has got something of Darwinism, which says, that only the strong can survive. How could they, if them were taken all their abilities? Otherwise Alex is also a victim of his own destiny: he causes violence...and gets back what he deserves!<br/><br/>Alex is played impressively by Malcolm McDowell, who had the role of his life with this. After this one he hadn´t made anything that could be compared with Kubrick´s film (I call it the Dennis-Hopper-Syndrome). He tried to repeat his success with films like ""Caligula"", but... In the 90s his most important roles were playing the bad guys in a ""Star Trek""-movie and in the filming of the comic adaptation to ""Tank Girl"". It´s a pity that you can see this charismatic actor nowadays only in meaningless B- and C- movies and video premiers. Instead of that, let´s watch ""A Clockwork Orange"" for one more time, an immortal classic, that everybody has to be seen! (10/10)"

","This is a movie that makes you really stop and think.  It is true that it is a good movie in itself, but there is also a philosophical element in this movie.  It's about choices and free will and existentialism.  Does man have the right to take away another man's free will?  If man ceases to have free will, does he cease to be a man?  Then he is merely a clockwork orange, pleasing to the eye (orange), and yet perfect, a puppet of god or the devil that is as predictable as clockwork.  This movie has the potential to change your way of thinking.  ""A Clockwork Orange"" and perhaps ""The Truman Show"" are the greatest movies ever made if one judges on the basis of how deep the movie is.  This is one of only two or three movies that I would give a ten out of ten."

","Without a doubt the greatest movie of all time, directed by the best director of all time.  The movie can disturb you, shock you, and at times make you laugh, but in the end it is an experience like no other.  It is also quite possibly the most important movie ever made.  There have been countless attempts to decipher as to what the movie ""was saying"".  In actuality it says it all.  Whether it deals with the violent side of man kind, or of moral choice, the messages are clear.  I was totally disturbed by the violence in this movie, but it was not senseless.  It needed to be there, and the people watching needed to be disturbed.  When Alex was released from prison, apparently ""cured"" we see that the world had turned on him, and he had no longer the means to fight back.  It is because they took away his moral choice to be violent.  He was only cured in the sense that he no longer had the choice, now is that really moral?  Sure he was violent, but he chose to be that way, and in the end that is what he would turn out to be again.  You cannot change people if they don't want to change themselves.  Alex deserved punishment, not rehabilitation, for that movie showed us that we are what we are, and there is nothing anyone can do about it.  I encourage everyone to see this movie, and make your own interpretation, much like I did.  It may differ from mine, but if there is one thing we should take from it, it is that we are all individuals with our own thoughts, beliefs, and opinions. ********** all the way."

","A Clockwork Orange is simply an incredible film.  Stanley Kubrick hit the nail on the head with this masterpiece, which should have placed higher amongst the greatest films of all time.  Most do not recognize the level of satire that the film possesses.  After committing terrible ultraviolent crimes, Alex boy goes through his treatment, only to return to terrorize society in another way.  What viewers must understand is that when Alex is ""cured"", it is his previous victims that again get the shaft from his presence.  Take the old writer for example-- he is left a cripple without a wife, and Alex returns to his house in serious need of help.  He offers help, although recognizing him as his previous attacker.  He then drugs him and proceeds to play Beethoven's Fifth to drive him out of his mind. Although he truly relishes this moment, he again gets screwed over by the system when Alex jumps and the man is locked up.  Who gets the royal treatment!?  Alex boy does because he puts the system's rehab methods in serious jeopardy!!  He makes the Minister of the Inferior Interior look like a fool, causing him to kiss Alex's a**e and providing him with the greatest accomodations.  MIND BLOWING!!  That is but one example... there are many more.  The point is that this is one of the greatest, most fantastic pieces of cinematic art put together.  The idea is brilliant, the acting is brilliant and the whole movie is simply superb and worth loomising.  It must be watched many times, however, to be fully understood.  Look out for many great, amusing scenes in the flick...  when Billyboy wears a German WWII uniform...  when the old man says, ""FOOD ALRIGHT!?

","I'll tell you why so many people hate this movie and see it as senseless violence. It is because kubrick uses the audience to his own end. Kubrick said, I will make you feel bad for this violent miscreant, and you all felt bad for him. When he was being drowned by his former droogs you thought this was uncalled for, when he was attacked by that mob by the guy who only wanted to know if our young alex could ""spare some cutter"" you felt it was unfair for him. He had been reformed, he was ""one of us now."" But of course he never was. He was a young violent thug who never was mentally reformed. He had the want but couldn't do the deed. And when you saw him come back to the forefront at the end, as evil and violent and when the Ludwig Van came out, that beautiful music and this horrific violent thing was shaking hands, you relized how bad you yourself really was. And Kubrick did his job."

","A Clockwork Orange was probably the first Stanley Kubrick film I ever saw. Well, it made me want to see more of Stan the man's movies and I'm glad I did.<br/><br/>The film is about a violent teenager, Alex DeLarge (Malcolm McDowell), of the 'future' (i.e. a dated 1970s view of the future) who goes on a brief rampage before being captured by the police. He then volunteers to take part in a scientific experiment to change his behaviour - the result is that he is transformed into a 'normal' person. He then goes around and sees the wrongs that he has done to his former victims.<br/><br/>A Clockwork Orange is held together by incredible direction from Stanley Kubrick, a brilliant and memorable performance from Malcolm McDowell and a haunting screenplay.

","Yep, right up there with critical darling Citizen Kane, A Clockwork Orange may look dated in some spots, but is too brilliant in every department to be taken off the Brilliant Films list. Master director Stanley Kubrick is at his height of creativity here, both in terms of visual style and storytelling. The original source material is a great novel, and though someone else's version might've looked different, and therefore looked more like what is described in the book, the story is otherwise quite faithful here. The film has everything: Action, comedy, sex, violence, prison drama, and Beethoven. What more could a person ask for? Though Kubrick directed other classic films, like The Shining, Full Metal Jacket, 2001: A Space Odyssey and Paths of Glory, this is undoubtedly his finest hour. A Clockwork Orange is one of the most original films in existence. Like it or not, you'll never forget it... **** out of ****"

"Duck_of_Death23","10","0","0","17 December 2000"," Good for laughs and lashings of the ol' ultraviolence
","Stanley Kubrick's 1971 classic is known for it's surrealism and shocking story line.  Many believe the film is nothing more than a test of a person's morality.  Many believe that the film promotes violence in a negative way on young modern day culture.  I believe the film promotes the ability to simply think of the darkness that lies beneath the human soul.<br/><br/>A Clockwork Orange is the story of a teenage criminal named Alex who learns the hard way that you reap of what you sow.  The film sets you up so that when Alex commits his crimes you feel rather humored or jolly.  I, myself would blame this on the music.  The music provides a sense of repulsiveness and therefore allowing the members of the audience to know right from wrong in theory.  The music I think is used to allow the audience member to feel and live in Alex's obvious state of euphoria when committing these crimes. But, when Alex is captured and forced into ""non-violence"", he is let out of prison after two years of what he calls a human zoo onto the streets he once destroyed.  We cannot feel nothing but empathy for our character as every one in his life rejects and attacks him.  The reason we feel this empathy is because the emotion is finally released onto the story, and I felt that the character had reclaimed his humanity by being hurt the same way he once hurt others.<br/><br/>Another reason I believe that we can feel empathy is because of the balance of anger and happiness.  When Alex is raping or bashing another person, he feels happy, unlike the very people who seek revenge upon our lead character.  They are not happy when they are avenging their lost dignity. Instead, they are mad.  Anger has consumed them and caused them to lash out at a defenseless man who has lost it all.  Of all of the violent scenes in the film, of all terrifying ideas that come into play, only one scene actually takes the sticks out when I think of A Clockwork Orange.  The scene is when Alex is let out of prison and goes home to greet his parents for the first time in two years.  Here, he consciously learns that what he had done was wrong and must pay for his sins.  As the background violin score begins to play, I could not help but nearly cry as he began to.  This scene is arguably the most powerful scene and always I feel touched by the humanity that courses through it.  I love A Clockwork Orange just because of this scene and how it can make all the bad in the film forgettable for just one moment of clarity.<br/><br/>The movie does examine the darkness that flows throughout the human mind. Life has two paths; Love or hate.  Alex chose hate and got exactly in return what he had thrown onto others. Love is beneficial towards the evil aspect in a way of exchange as Alex slowly learns.  How close are we to becoming a planet of evil, as Alex did?  How close are you?"

","There's this one Tool song that has a lyric that goes ""Do onto others as they've done to you.""  That lyric seems to fit the idea (not the moral) behind A Clockwork Orange.  Before I continue with this review, I'd like to make it clear that I am a Kubrickian.  I think this is his best film, though 2001 comes really close.  Anyway, on with it... So, I'm sitting in my father's basement and its about two o'clock in the morning.  It's in the middle of summer and my life has become victim of boredom in a vast teenage wasteland.  I see this movie and I fall in love with it, so my life starts over again.  This sort of thing has happened to me before, most recently with The Last Temptation of Christ.  So, I planned on going on-line to discuss the film with some people I know.  I then got the idea that I should read the book.  So I did.  Burgess' A Clockwork Orange and the Kubrick film ruled my life for a two-week period.  Both are disturbing; both are funny; both are both at the same time... the book moreso, but this isn't a book review, now is it? It was even funny while watching poor Alex suffer the torture of being rehabilitated.  Why it was funny I don't think too many people could actually say.  It just felt so amusing to see this sick, twisted soul be tortured.  After a while it makes you feel like a Roman pig, such as a Caesar (maybe Colligula), that just got done watching a family of lions tear up an innocent young Jewish folk.  That's the strange thing about it, Alex wasn't innocent at all! Kubrick is like a god to me.  His use of still frames with the eerie music of Beethoven oozing in the background... only to explode to the foreground at one point... is pure genius.  His zooming in directly on Alex and his droogs, with an angle that may have the camera looking up or down upon him that's no wider than a centimeter, leaves the viewer uncomfortable at all costs.  He's the twisted surrealist of the English language cinema... but he also has his head on his shoulders. Malcolm McDowell gives one of the finest performances of his time and of all time.  I loved his character and his character's story.  I hated him at some points, and felt sorry for him at other points.  My own feelings towards him, the film, and the book haunt me to this day."

This is the 'slanguage' used throughout the story, and was created by the author to punctuate the disturbing ideas we see. This language is supposed to be Russian-based with some other Euro-touches thrown on top. It might be handy to pick up a copy of the paperback if you are watching this for the first time on tape or DVD. Most copies have a glossary in the back so you can look up definitions while the movie is paused. <br/><br/>  I've found that most women hate this film. It is too violent and misogynistic for the casual unsuspecting viewer, male or female. But once you start watching it, I recommend seeing it through until the end.

"Verbal-39","10","0","0","13 September 2000"," A Satire of a Sick Nature
","Stanley Kubrick took Anthony Burgess' classic novel of weird things to come in the not-too-distant future and created a timeless masterpiece. A Clockwork Orange is brilliant from the dark, disturbing intro right through to the funny, energetic ending. We meet a young man, Alexander DeLarge, who tells us of his fondness for a bit of the ""old ultra-violence"". Although strange in his fashion, decor and russian-american lingo, Alex can be clearly identified with some of todays youths who terrorise the streets at night. Through the coarse of the film, we see Alex turned from the devil of the night to the sobbing, frail man being carried in the arms of his former victems bodyguard. After proving his power to the world when he stunned us with the deep, brilliant 2001:a space oddyssey, A Clockwork Orange was the first film that really set Kubrick aside from other directors. He used A Clockwork Orange to convey some of the deep studies of human nature that he hides in almost all of his films (i.e. exploration of madness and the ""duality of man"" and schitsophrenia) as we see Alex transform himself from rapist and killer to son and schoolchild living with his parents by day, terrorising the innocent at night. It is a really disturbing look at human nature and society in general. The film seems to say that there is no cure for criminality and also stabs a punch at the justice system and the government all in one. But the one thing that strikes you about A Clockwork Orange is the fact that this disturbing, dark study is funny. In fact it's the funniest film Kubrick made since Dr. Strangelove. This is mainly helped by Malcom McDowell's brilliant performance. He brings a light-hearted deviousness and charm to the monsters face. Ultimately A Clockwork Orange is a brilliant, disturbing, dark, satirical look at society and the way things are going, slowly. Because of the abstractness and fable-like sets, this masterpiece is timeless. Ultimately entertaining and rewarding, this is one not to miss."

","A Clockwork Orange is easily one of Kubrick's best films, and it is probably one of the best films ever made. The reason this classic is so outstanding is because it excels beyond a limit in every area. The direction from Kubrick was excellent,  the acting was brutally honest, the script was unbelieveably good and the photography was lovely. Still, while this film is sometimes extremely hard to watch, we are still required to laugh at times, with the stand-out jokes from the script. <br/><br/>I highly recommend you see this film, it is one of the few movies that matches up to its book.

","When I first watched this film I had no idea what to expect. I had heard all the usual stories, its shocking and disgusting - basically a terrible vulgar piece of film which was worth staying away from, an image of this film which is completely inaccurate. It is a very clever film which deals with important questions about people such as Alex. What is the best way to deal with these obviously remorseless and uncaring people? Is the way that Alex was treated really justice? These are the questions that you come out of the cinema wondering. Its about a group of three teenagers, and their leader-Alex who get their kicks from stealing, beating and raping anyone who gets in their way. It deals mainly with Alex, his arrest and the 'justice' or lack of, that he receives. It is actually quite a funny film and the soundtrack is fantastic. Alex is obsessed with Beethoven and it is used throughout the film. Granted, it is a very shocking and disturbing film, but it is not, as it was made out to me, a mindlessly violent film. In fact it is quite the opposite. I think the one thing that people were most offended by when this film was first released was the amount of quite graphic sexual imagery. In my opinion it suits the theme and doesn't take away from the film at all. I think that this most likely the best of Stanley Kubrick's work and everyone who appreciates good film should see it."

","After 2001: a space odyssey, one could be forgiven of thinking that Kubrick had reached his peak, but of course he topped it with this extraordinary adaptation of Anthony Burgess's accomplished, dazzingly original novel. With perhaps the finest director ever ( after Scorsese ) behind the helm, This is sheer brilliance. Diluting Burgess's unique nadsat language for a more coherent effect. this is satisfyingly accessible yet dazzingly powerful, perfectly rendered, utterly memorable and highly exhilarating. combining careful, perfect pacing, an wicked sense of humour and a brilliant sense of politics. this is filmmaking at it's unparalleled best. The story is correctly simple yet epic and breathtaking in scope. a gang member being captured by the government, subjected to tests and put out into the world, a non violent person skillfully raises issues of freedom of will and corruption highlighted further by his love of Beethoven being taken away from him as well as his love of violence showing the blatant disregard of the government just wanting to please the people without caring what side effects it might have on such people as Alex. Malcolm McDowell is perfect as Alex de Large who's basically a thug but he also employs our sympathy and pity as he is paid back in full for all the bad things he has done which in the film are shown in brilliantly stylized but undeniably disturbing fashion. these feature the beating of an writer Mr Alexander( Patrick Magee,who is superb )and the horrifying rape of his wife to Singing in the rain, the ferocious beating of an old tramp, an attack on a rival gang, group sex and most memorably perhaps, the beating to death of an gymnast with an huge phallus like object. As you might of guessed, this is also an frightening and brilliantly disturbing experience. Often misconceived as a mere video nasty, this is so much more than that, it might be as shocking as it was but with the state of the world as it is today, it's dazzling, brilliantly flawless, impressive vision is coming closer to reality making it even more disturbing and even ahead of it's time today. Utterly unmissable and written and directed to perfection by cinema's most daring auteur to date, this is the finest film made in britain and one of the top 10 ever made. an bold statement perhaps but an true one."

The crippled writer and the probation officer, to take the two most obvious examples, act in a way that seems so unnaturalistic as to appear extremely bad by normal acting standards.  Given Kubrik's legendary control-freak tendencies as a director I assumed that this was deliberate stylisation, perhaps designed deliberately to alienate the audience.<br/><br/>After I saw ""Eyes Wide Shut"", however - another film not exactly blessed with great dramatic performances - I wonder if the answer is somewhat simpler.

","`Alex's adventures are a kind of psychological myth. Our subconscious finds release in Alex, just as it finds release in dreams. It resents Alex being stifled and repressed by authority, however much our conscious mind recognizes the necessity of doing this.' - Stanley Kubrick 1971.<br/><br/>I read the novel when I was only in 3rd grade by my own free will. People would stare at me as if I was crazy or something whenever I would walk into stores and I had the book in my hand. I never clearly understood the book, probably due to the British dialect and the complex plot. But there were two words that stood out from the book 1. Droogs 2. Korova Milkbar. I remember I used to call my friends droogs for a while, and the Korova Milkbar fascinated me because I used to see pictures of it in books and it was something I've never seen before. The pictures I saw were so bizarre and psychedelic yet at the same time beautiful. <br/><br/>After seeing the movie I felt in love with it. It's the tale of Alex and his `droogs' whose motifs are violence and sexual pleasures from rape. Alex is a rude young man who is respected by his droogs because he is intimidating. Alex threatens them so much they can't take no more and frame him. Alex is sent to prison and is sentenced for 13 years. Alex tries to behave so that he can leave prison on parole. He studies the bible and learns that it is not entirely holy due to its repelling content. Murder, sex, violence, betrayal are some themes he finds within the `holy' bible. Alex later hears of a program the government is trying to conduct with a random inmate. The experiment will result in an individual never to perform any sort of violent crime ever again. Alex is chosen for this experiment. The process consists of strapping the person into a chair while they are shown images on a screen of extreme violence. For Alex this is heaven for him because that is what he did before going to prison. He saw beauty in violence. As days with the experiment pass by, Alex starts to feel the effects of the experiment. He starts to be disgusted by what he sees onscreen. The experiment is a success. Alex is then released a free man. He comes across all the people he made harm too and they claim their revenge on him. <br/><br/>This is without a doubt a very powerful tale of an `eye-popping dystopian vision' of the ultra violent, with an intelligent mix of classical music with the blend of violence. A tale that makes us feel sorry for the horrendous person that is truly Alex behind the government experiment. This is another film from Kubrick, the cinematic genius who made a masterpiece every time he picked up the camera."

","The impact and notoriety of A Clockwork Orange can scarcely be imagined outside Britain.<br/><br/>Whereas the film has been freely available across the continent, and has perhaps subsequently lost it's power, it's release in Britain after twenty-seven years has given a build-up and expectation that I doubt no film could truly satiate. While the movie has been screened through myriads of smoke-hazed student bedrooms on fourth-generation pirate videos for the last two decades, I still can't help feeling it's wide re-release will leave many feeling disappointed.<br/><br/>Removed from this country by Kubrick himself, allegedly through fears of ""copycat"" violence, the director insisted that the film would be released in Britain over his dead body. Rather an ill-fitting tribute, then, that the film should finally be aired after his death. And yet what a great tribute, for A Clockwork Orange is also a work that touches genius (though occasionally scrapes mudanity) and is arguably his finest.<br/><br/>For nearly thirty years all Britain has had to remember this film is the very few pop art references that bleed into the mainstream culture. The odd Blur video that sees them dressed as ""Droogs"", or an old creaky episode of ""Doctor Who"", based on the movie, which sees the Master trying his own version of the Ludovico technique (a ""Keller Machine"") to rid evil from prisoners. But now we finally get to see what all the fuss is really about.<br/><br/>To be honest, time and the ban have robbed this film of much of its potency. The violence, outrageous at it's inception, is now tame by modern standards, and heavily choreographed. While it's vision of a future society is achieved on a remarkably small budget, there are times when that most crass of decades, the seventies, seeps through any sense of credibility. Camp in places, a whole plethora of ""light entertainment"" stalwarts make this distracting viewing in its home country. Dalziel out of comedy-drama detective show ""Dalziel and Pascoe"" rubs shoulders with the parrot-seducing wacky employment officer from ""The Young Ones"", and Coronation Street's ""Fred Elliot"", while the star of unfunny sitcom ""The 10%ers"" takes a bow. Okay, it's perhaps possible to believe the denizens of the future will indulge in severe retro-kitsch, though Alex playing Beethoven on an old eight-track machine is a little disconcerting. Elsewhere, a prison guard resembles and acts like Hitler, all stomping and shouting, reducing the fabric of the film to farce. The lowest ebb of this dating is Alex and his droogs joyriding through country lanes. Whereas Pulp Fiction had Bruce Willis in a taxi cab to a filmed backdrop as a touch of post-modern lo-fi, here the ""racing scenery"" played in the background of what is very obviously a stage produced sniggers from a more ""sophisto"" audience of the 90s.<br/><br/>Often, though, it is brilliant. Direction is flawless, and iconography and design are exceptional. The language uttered by the central characters is a bizarre concoction of pidgin, fabricated Russian, almost-Shakespearean English and common slang. A typical utterance, pre-gang fight is: ""How art thou, thou globby bottle of cheap, stinking chip oil? Come and get one in the yarbles, if you have any yarbles, you eunuch jelly thou"".<br/><br/>In fact, it is the first half an hour or so that is the film's highlight. While the violence is extremely tame by latter standards, it is the context with which it is presented that still gives it its capacity to shock. Scenes of rape are juxtaposed with the music of Beethoven or Gene Kelly, while overlaid is the indifferent, casual, semi-monotone of an outstanding McDowell. It is this combining of images that lends the film its greatest highs. A Nazi rally marching to the lightest strings of Beethoven is a remarkable cinematic achievement, though having a fantasy sequence where Alex whips Jesus seems to be over-egging the pudding somewhat.<br/><br/>Yet after this startling opening the film starts to drag as Alex is incarcerated and the comedy is stepped up. Jailed for murder (in one of the film's most symbolic moments he fights the owner of a health farm with a statue of a giant phallus. She, in turn, fights back with a bust of Beethoven; sexual desire vs. culture), Alex is given the option of freedom. The basic idea is that he undergoes a sophisticated Pavlovian treatment, whereby images are displayed while he is conditioned to act in revulsion. Cured of violent impulses, or at least the desire to act them out, he is released back into society. The jail's Priest stands up and makes a speech on the ethical viewpoints of free will. This is another (minor) flaw in the film: the overstatement and unsubtle usage of moral debate. Allegory is jettisoned as characters take centre stage and siloquoise about the issues in a literal manner (the tramp particularly) before being silenced or beaten into submission.<br/><br/>Alex's reintegration into society mirrors the beginning of the film, though lacks its verve through contrivance. No spoilers here, though his choice of bathtub song does stretch the boundaries of credulity a little. Then comes the worst scene in the entire film, where a nurse is seen retreating from a curtained bed after intercourse, her chest exposed. It adds nothing to the film and performs no function other than used as light relief or titillation. This casts doubt over the whole of the preceding work; has Kubrick been using nudity in the film to make a serious social satire or is the sight of bare breasts and defiled women merely a cause for arousal, or to laugh at, and to applaud?<br/><br/>The picture is still one of the twenty or thirty greatest films ever made, and, because it has something to say, one of the ten most important. As for science fiction, I would place this amongst the three greatest of the genre (alongside Planet of the Apes and, ironically, Kubrick's 2001). But, with a film that has been forbidden fruit for so long, there is an inevitable sense of disappointment."

It is about 4 guys who have three hobbies: beating up people, raping girls and listening to Betowen's music. This gang has a leader, played by Malcolm MacDowell, who goes to prison after the rape and murder of an old millionnaire's wife. But he is used as a ''laboratory rat''. Scientists make weird experiments on him. The goal of these experiments is to stop Malcolm MasDowell's addiction to violence, rape, coarse language and Betowen's music. But when MacDowell realizes that he gets sick when he sees violence or when he listens to Betowen's music, he knows he can easily get in deep trouble. And people who saw him on the newspapers for the rape and murder of the young girl remember him and know his new handicap. They beat him up, and he has to hide if he doesn't want to get killed. The closest place to hide is the millionnaire's house, where he killed the millionnaire's wife. This film is different from other movies about violence. It shows violence in an almost funny way, and the meaning of it is that there would be no world if there was no violence, we simply don't have to abuse...The satire is even bigger in this film than the huge one in Dr.Strangelove.

It isn't as good a satire as Dr. Strangelove, nor is as full of wonder as 2001, but it probably Kubrick's most peculiar film.<br/><br/>Whenever I hear someone who says they love this movie, I ask them why.  If they say because of the violence, my heart sinks.  I want to tell them that's not the point, and if that's the reason you like this movie, than you have no business watching it.<br/><br/>This movie isn't Kubrick's best, but it isn't a narcissistic piece of showmanship as some have suggested.  It is a puzzling and interesting piece of work."
"Angeneer","9","0","0","17 January 2000"," Not a clockwork movie
","The effort of Kubrick to embed symbolism in every detail is obvious from the beginning. About the brutality and sex, while in 1971 this might have been a shocking movie, nowadays it is nothing special. What is interesting though is the way these scenes are presented, with the environment (sound, face expressions, scenery) contradicting with what is actually happening, trying to disorient the viewer and make him think if in his actual life he pays attention to the bare event or to the package that goes with it. What a contradiction is Beethoven's 9th with murder and rape, as even the protagonist admits in the film. In general this is a movie worked out in detail, but I think so much importance is given in the depth of particular scenes that the flow of the film is affected and it loses its coherency, making it difficult for a not determined viewer to sit and watch. This of course doesn't remove from The Clockwork Orange the masterpiece status, but suggests that the unprepared pay attention to the inner meaning of this film."

","A Clockwork Orange is all about free will.  In a way I think it is an answer to or companion to 2001.<br/><br/>All the characters, human and machine, in 2001 followed the most logical course of action never letting emotion or personal interests get involved. The humans were not noticeably different from HAL.  They all saw something happen, analysed it, decided what to do, then followed through without any noticeable emotion or interest.  The actors were very boring and mechanical for a reason.<br/><br/>A Clockwork Orange is the exact opposite in that no one acted out of any logical necessity.  Characters were alive.  They had wants, needs, and desires.  When the state tried to treat Alex's violence by conditioning him to resist his own free will it back fired.  They learned, or more precisely they should have learned, that not being able to do bad is not the same as being good.<br/><br/>The Prison Chaplin made two short speeches on the necessity of free will, and how the treatment would not help to make Alex a better person.  In the end I though he was the one major character who cared about Alex as a person.<br/><br/>PS Notice also that Kubrick planted a copy of the 2001 soundtrack on prominent display at the record store!"

","This film should be noted as one of Kubrick's masterpieces not only because of its great performances, fantastic script, and intriguing camera angles, but also because Kubrick is able to manipulate the minds of the audience who view the film.  Stanley Kubrick shows us a young criminal committing various acts of horrendous crime.  However, rather than show the young lad as a monster, Kubrick goes to great lengths to let us inside the character's head, and feel sympathetic towards him.  Kubrick has a great power of being able to present a murderer as a character we feel sorry for.  This is a great film."

"andy-227","Null","0","0","31 December 1999"," Stanley Kubrick's last great film!
","One of the things that has always amazed me about Stanley Kubrick is his ability to show something amazing, beautiful, or sick, without the aid of special effects or visual pyrotechnics.  He sees the world through the camera lens for what it really is.  One of the greatest examples of which is his scathing satire, ""A Clockwork Orange"".  Here, we see a world not too other worldly from our own.  It's riddled with derilict buildings, wicked gangs, and a government that can do nothing to change it all.  The most frightening aspect of the film is the examination and study of the main character, Alex.  He is a vicious, violent criminal who kills, robs, and rapes.  In the rape scene while singing 'Singin' in the Rain', he wears a long, protruding 'Pinnochio' nose, as an example of a man with no conscience.  His parents do nothing to raise him, and he doesn't go to school.  Later, he attacks his own gang members, gleefully slashing the hand of one of them.  Here, all the details of a criminal have been laid out. Now comes the second half of the film.  Instead of keeping him in prison, he is given a treatment making him sick every time he sees or is exposed to violence, sex, and his true love, Beethoven.  He is cured, or so it is said. After being released back into the world, those he did harm to now have a chance of retaliation.  After it's all over, the drugs wear off, and he becomes his old self again, revealing he never was cured to begin with. What makes this film so stunning and so powerful is that it doesn't go over the top or exaggerate.  It merely looks on at the real world, and foreshadows things to come.  It's actually really creepy.  But Kubrick tells the story through the eyes of the criminal, making it somewhat easier to watch, even though we should be terrified and disgusted.  Kubrick's choice of music is superb, so good that I bought the soundtrack and frequently listen to it.  Ultimately, ""A Clockwork Orange"" satirizes the world we live in today, and leaves us not only with an anti-violence message, but pops a difficult question upon the audience, which would you rather?  A criminal, or a 'clockwork orange', a criminal crippled within reflex mechanisms?"

","You know, I've never made a top 10 list of my favorite movies ever. Maybe because I'm just 15 and I haven't seen so many classics and masterpieces yet. But I really liked the ones I saw, such as ""Psycho"", ""Casablanca"", ""Rear Window"", ""Gone With the Wind"", among others, but in special Stanley Kubrick's films. I think he is a genius since I saw ""Eyes Wide Shut"" this year, so I decided to rent some other celebrated films of him. First, it was ""The Shining"". I thought it was a very scary and impressing horror movie, one of the best things ever made on the genre. After that I saw ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". This one just fascinated me. If I make a top 10 list, I think ""2001"" will be on the top. It is the best sci-fi ever and one of the most beautiful studies about the human beings. But I can't forget ""A Clockwork Orange"", that is for sure one of the most disturbing and impressing films ever made.<br/><br/>""A Clockwork Orange"" is not for everyone, first of all- as many other Kubrick's movies. It is really strong- violent, with some strong sexuality, rapes, etc. But the main reason for what I call it 'strong' is the theme. It is about a futuristic society, where the violence is everywhere and it seems to have no order. A young man, named Alex, leads a group of disorders- his 'droogs'- whose main interest is the 'ultra violence'. They drug themselves, break in houses, rape women, violent men. In addition, Alex loves Beethoven. Some day, in the middle of a house break-in, his 'droogs' betray him and he is caught by the police. He is taken to prison, but there he hears about a treatment which can cure disorders. He persuades and is persuaded to be part of the treatment. It is all very strange and shocking, but the doctors claim to have cured him. He tries to start a normal life again, but... was he really cured?<br/><br/>Only Stanley Kubrick could have done a masterpiece like this one. Everything is perfect, from the soundtrack to the acting. It is used symbolic elements and some words that can seem very strange, but there is a vocabulary for them in the credits. They are very interesting in fact- pay attention. Kubrick cares for each detail and uses a dark humor to tell the story, that is somehow tragic in some moments- the victims' payback. Funny (darkly funny) in others- the ending. Shocking in others- see, for example, the scene where Alex sings 'Singing in the Rain' while he rapes a woman. The movie was even banned in some countries, but this is just stupid.<br/><br/>Overall, ""A Clockwork Orange"" will certainly be on my top 10 list when I make it. It is weird. It is scary. It is impressing. It is disturbing. It is unforgettable!"

","Remember this is just one persons opinion! I feel that this is one of the best movies ever made by the best director ever. Anyone who is shocked by this movie only proves the greatness of what Kubrick was able to do with a camera, not always the best actors around, and an original storyline. I would like to point out that Burgess, ( the author ) basically wrote a story about one theory of one possible future for our society. Kubrick took this and built layer upon layer of depth to the main character, and has the viewer making a decision; Is this man a hero or a victim? He is capable of both good and bad. Also ask yourself these questions: Do you really SEE anyone get murdered or raped ? It's only implied. It's all about choice. Kubrick, the Master, leaves it up to you."

It is a bizarre and brilliant film that makes a statement on many subjects ranging from teen violence to police brutality to government corruption.  One of the highlights is the adapted score assembled by Kubrick and matching the film's often disturbing images perfectly and with great irony.

I see this movie at least once or twice a year, and I am always amazed at some of the visual elements and devices that Kubrick uses.  Stanley Kubrick did most of the camera work for this film himself, mostly using a small hand held camera that allowed him to follow along almost as another character in the movie.

Anybody who says that there is no point is completely missing the point. Is it right to take away free will, even if that free will is rape and violence? And when everybody gets their revenge on Alex, he is helpless. But what makes the people getting revenge any better than Alex, when they have violent impulses inside them as well.

","Rarely have I seen a film, especially one that was deemed controversial since its release, that would just overtake all five senses and make me eradicate its shortcomings;  instead, it would allow me to carp it as a really formidable piece of work that it ought to be, especially after seeing the picture for the very first time.  Such is the case with 1971's ""A Clockwork Orange"", a sometimes darkly funny and sinister view of a nearly futuristic society gone to the deep end, as told by the cheeky and calm narrator/main character, Alex(portrayed masterfully by Malcolm McDowell). Its director, Stanley Kubrick ,had done a grand job at creating this netherworld with the appropriate lighting and space effects, not to mention, the brutal moodiness around it.  Mind you, one must be warned not to view it as a run of the mill weekend fare rented from the local video place, to capture the whole essence of what is being said(as often Kubrick's films usually are required to be seen more than once)- I may have be one of few to understand its nature from the start(and that's only because I read the Anthony Burgess novella beforehand)but again, one doesn't have to know, say, aversion therapy to see it. If you have an open mind to movies that are merely produced as ""screen paintings"" with something to tell as an added plus, in lieu of the ""quickie quotas"" made that are filled with the usual scatological humor or mindless blood and gore, then you need not look any further.  ""A Clockwork Orange"" truly represents  to be a compelling example from the former category."

"jtamburi","Null","0","0","17 October 1999"," Real meaning of A Clockwork Orange
","I just watched this film last night, and when I had finished, I thought I had figured out the meaning of this film.  I.e., the messages that Burgess was trying to get across.  But then I started reading reviews of the film on the IMDB and was shocked to see what other readers thought of the film's message!  I was shocked to see how differently I view the world compared to my fellow citizens.<br/><br/>But anyhow, here is my take:<br/><br/>The first thing I realized after viewing the film was how there was no point during the entire movie that I actually sympathized with the ""protagonist"". This was an unusual experience for me, and the only other movie I can think of which triggered the same reaction from me was ""kids"".  Sure, there were a couple of times I sympathized with Malcolm McDowell, the actor.  For instance, when he had his eyelids forced open or when he was forced underwater for an unbelievable length of time while being beaten.  But I never sympathized for the character, Alex.  In fact, I rather enjoyed this trough scene, and as a viewer I couldn't wait until he received his just deserts.  I was eager to see him finally repay his debt to society, and was ultimately dismayed that he never got the opportunity to do so properly.<br/><br/>While reading reviews, some reviewers likened Alex's ""treatment"" with getting ""brainwashed"", and being ""dehumanized"".  But I saw neither of these to be the case.  Reviewers also claimed that Alex's treatment caused a loss of his ""free will"", which I also argue against.  Let's examine these accusations:<br/><br/>First of all, Alex was clearly not brainwashed, and I thought Burgess went out of his way to demonstrate this.  Brainwashing is when the person's own thoughts are intentionally muddled and replaced by new thoughts.  George Orwell's 1984 demonstrates brainwashing through propaganda really well. But in Alex's case, it was very clear that his desires did not change after the treatment.  He was the same old Alex -- just that he had a permanent ""restraining bolt"" in place.  Kind of like mental handcuffs. (Remember when the naked woman came out on stage? Alex wanted to rape her senseless.  His handcuffs prevented it).<br/><br/>Many reviewers claim he was ""dehumanized"".  I must ask these people:  was Alex ""human"" when he was terrorizing society every night?  Or was he animalistic?  Before the treatment, we was unable to sit still long enough to experience real human emotion, such as parental detachment and loss of friendships.  Afterwards, he was free to explore these emotions -- he was free to explore sides of his own personality that were previously unknown to him.  People who question my use of the word ""free"" should understand that he is no more ""free"" that you and I are.<br/><br/>Did Alex loose his free will?  No, of course not.  He could choose to experience all the same things he could before.  Just that this time he feels the consequences of his actions -- immediately.  The idea is that Alex would eventually not want to be evil anymore.  But he never reached this stage of the movie, as his narration proved. Most people's ""free will"" is similarly limited also.  But my free will is limited by conscience -- Alex's was not.  The question this raises is -- would this have always been the case for Alex? Who knows?<br/><br/>In conclusion, Alex's treatment was in fact, a complete success.  He was just beginning to learn that his actions have consequences.  He was learning ""tough love"".  What he really needed at that point in is life was a true friend, not a droog, who could help him learn his true humanity for the first time in is life.  Someone who could teach him that in order to be loved, he must treat others with kindness and compassion.  This last paragraph looks like I'm sympathizing with Alex, which is contrary to what I stated above.  But this is not true.  I'm sympathizing with Alex's potential - a potential which was never fulfilled.<br/><br/>And the reason it was never fulfilled was because politicians, in their infinite wisdom, caved into public opinion (fueled by the media), and removed his handcuffs.  The implication is that all was lost, and he's back to square one, and now less human than ever."

Kubrick kicks Burgess's intentions into touch early on and turns the entire film into a vindication of Alex. All authority figures are portrayed as obnoxious, faceless caricatures. Without exception, each of Alex's 'victims' are more 'unpleasant' than they are in the book, presumably in an attempt to justify their treatment: the cat-lady is changed from a frail  old lady into a rich-bitch yoga freak; Alex's brutal rape of two 10-year girls is turned into a high-speed orgy with two willing teenage participants. The misogyny rampant throughout the film is especially shocking; Kubrick's obsession with displaying nubile, large-bosomed girls in various forms of undress would appear to suggest that his key influences were not, as previously thought, Max Ophuls and Sergei Eisenstein, but rather Russ Meyer and Benny Hill. <br/><br/>
Leaving aside its dubious morality, I would agree that there is much to admire in the film. Malcolm McDowell gives a dynamic performance (despite being 10 years too old for the role) and should have got the Oscar. The camera-work and use of music is as good as anything that Kubrick has ever done. However, I have tried and, so far, failed to fathom why this film is as highly regarded as it is. Most of its most ardent admirers do however appear to be young males. Why should this be? Perhaps, rather like the men who claim to buy Playboy magazine for the John Updike short story, it allows them an opportunity to revel in sex and violence with the comforting pretence that they're viewing 'a social satire by a major film-maker.'"
"Chuck-149","9","0","0","9 September 1999"," The creepiest, most violent black-comedy ever.
","Stanley Kubrick is without a doubt one of the best directors of all-time. His classic movies span from 1957 with ""Paths of glory"" up until today and his movies are still greatly appreciated.  Among his classics are ""Paths of glory"", ""2001: a space odyssey"", ""Full metal jacket"", and my personal favorite, ""Dr. Strangelove"".  In all of these movies, you can see the desire that Kubrick has to depict violence as it really is.  Well in ""A clockwork orange"", he depicted it better than any director did in any other movie.  In this true classic, you can see what Kubrick was all about: Showing events as violent as they really are.<br/><br/>  The story revolves around a teenage boy named Alex (Malcolm McDowell) and his three ""droogs"" whose night-time pleasures are murder and rape.  The movie begins with the four ""droogs"" drinking a drugged milk in some kind of a bar for milk.  They then leave the bar and just for the fun of it, decide to kill an old beggar.  They then rob a car, pull up to someone's house, and after having been able to enter, they rape and kill the woman and cripple her husband.  After a second attempt at rape and murder, Alex's friends backstab him and turn him over to the cops.  It is then that he is sent to prison where he will volunteer for a special treatment which consists in taking out all the taste of violence out of a person.<br/><br/>  After having successfully passed the treatment, he is set free.  But when he gets back into the world, everything has changed and Alex suddenly begins having great problems.  Ultraviolent and a little sick, this futuristic black-comedy is probably the first movie people think of when they think of Kubrick.  It may not be for all tastes, but it's still a classic and any movie-buff should imperatively watch it."

To deny me a film like this, but to recommend such trash as ""I Spit on Your Grave"" and ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" is a sin.  This is the most brilliant film I have ever seen.

","I previously thought that the greatest movie of all times was ""Braveheart"", how wrong I was. I had seen ""Clockwork"" before, but I didn't quite understand it, as I was too young to get the point. The movie consists of two halves, the first part is the bizarre, disturbing, ultra-violent, sexual and complex part of a routine day in Alex DeLarge's life. This part is really hard to understand, it is very complex, it has elements like the 5 Jesuses hugged and dancing. This shot alone is enough to write a thesis about it. Then the second part is really what the movie is about, but people seem to remember better the first part and this part is the one that has made this movie an all-time cult classic. The music chosen for the movie is also perfect, I couldn't picture the movie with another song. The casting is perfect, Alex couldn't have been played better than by Malcolm McDowell, with his funny-evil expressions, that give a double meaning to every scene. The best thing of this movie is the story itself, teaching us that we have a choice (this is what the bible is all about), whether to be violent or not, so then they show us what would happen if we weren't violent and Kubrick somehow lets us see that this is not the answer, that we need violence as a choice, really makes you think. But I think this movie isn't pro-violence because it shows you that if you are violent you will eventually get caught or get some kind of payback, so I would define it as pro-choice. When you see this movie you do not get a Hollywood, commercial movie, you get a piece of art, and movie-making today is lacking this. What people call weird I say it's art and that's why this is without a doubt the greatest picture of all time. All of those ""Traispotting"" fans MUST see this movie, because I think that its based on ""A Clockwork Orange"". Amen."

He is everything you would fear as you walk down a dark street at night yet you really feel for him when he is tortured with all that terapy. Kubrick's art direction and use of shadows shows the boys as scary, dark demons. Never before has a film had such a portrayal of the dark side of life. Unfortunetaly because of the two copycat murders, the brilliant movie was banned in England and Ireland. Banned by Kubrick himself because it had failed its purpose.

We are manipulated to understand Alex's (Malcom McDowall, in the year's best performance) point of view (and indeed Kubrick's).  It is stylized to a very high degree, with the William Tell overture to the sex scene a very nice touch.   The violence is harsh, but it is also stylized, like a choreographed dance.  The ""Singin in the Rain"" rape scene was one of the most memorable images in film history.

In my opinion, as well as many others, it tries to portray that what society often describes as ""evil"" is simply breaking the pre-defined mold.  The ultra-violence and sex can be repulsive to some, but they are a necessity to really instill the idea that these are the only people in the movie who are actually ALIVE.  Plus, the reversal of attacks later in the movie show the ability to live, the capacity for evil, is in everyone, only suppressed by brainwashing forced upon them by society.

The most recent example of this that I can think of is the South Park movie. Perhaps I've seen this film too many times to comment very well on it, but I'll try anyway.<br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick can do things no other director can. He can trick you into thinking. The first time I saw this movie I was thinking and didn't even know it! Truly, this is the first film that ever really made me think. Some people think that this movie is just rape, assault, and murder. Nothing could be further from the truth.

I suspect the original tale was meant to take place in a future somewhat distant from our own, but it sounds suspiciously like the way criminals are treated now.<br/><br/>The brilliance of the move is the contrast between graphic violence and absurd outrageous humour, along with a superb soundtrack that almost gives the film a farcical Monty Python quality.

","It may seem strange that I'm writing a comment here, as I never watched the entire film.  I started watching the film and ended up feeling quite ill after a half hour.  I do intend one day to sit down and try watching this film again, because I am sure that, characteristic of Kubrick's work (as well as consistent with the other reviews contained on this site), there is an important message to be had.  My problem was that a friend grabbed the video out of her parents' collection; we had no clue whatsoever as to what this movie was about, and I was caught off guard.  If I'm going to handle being deeply disturbed for an entire film, I need to be prepared for it. That is my point: if you are going to watch this film for the first time, please realise what you're going to get.  This is not like ""2001"" or ""The Shining"", where I don't think it matters if a person knows what to expect or not.  I do understand that part of the impact of a film comes from being caught off guard; if a person is too prepared for what is to come, the punch may lose all its force.  However, the point has no impact at all if a person can't stomach watching the movie long enough to get it.  So don't let your movie experience be ruined like mine: know what you're in for.<br/><br/>For those people who think that people who enjoy movies like this are sick and deranged, I think it's important to consider how the word ""enjoy"" is being used.  I don't use it myself when it comes to disturbing movies; I think Schindler's List is the best movie ever made, but I would not say I enjoyed it, in the sense of deriving pleasure from viewing it.  But others will use the word ""enjoy"" to describe their experiences of such films, and that shouldn't be taken as them ""enjoying"" murder, rape, genocide, or whatever other despicable act may be occurring on the screen.  I enjoy psychology, but that's not to say I enjoy others experiencing depression, schizophrenia, psychopathy, or anything else; it is a matter of enjoying the intellectual stimulation as well as the hope that out of studying such things something good will come, and I think this applies to movies.  To watch Schindler's List may give some empathy for victims of the Holocaust that they never had before, and I'm sure in watching this film there's some profound understanding of what humans are capable of given certain circumstances.  There is nothing sick about discovering such things, as long as one doesn't emulate them.  Too often people seem to confuse what happens on the screen with real life, and assume that anyone who watches violent films is bound for violence themselves.  I don't know how much violence on the screen motivates others' violence, but a movie like A Clockwork Orange does not glorify it.  As long as violence is depicted in a responsible way, I think it may even be beneficial for it to be viewed, lest we forget how rotten people can be.  Anyone who maintains that it is movies like this that lead to so much of the violence in our society needs to take a little look at history and stop pointing the fingers at people who've never committed a truly violent act in their lives but who happen to enjoy films that are violent.<br/><br/>Okay, that got rather political.  But this movie does have political and sociological implications- that much was clear from my brief viewing of it. It is important to note that this movie was not meant as a blueprint of how to behave, and anyone who thinks it is has problems that are going to arise without the movie.  So for all those people who call fans of this movie depraved: why not focus your energy on something that really matters, like getting guns off the street or children out of abusive homes or abusive parents and spouses into counseling, and leave movie fans alone."

The way Kubrick was able to define the space on screen with his sets and the way he lit them were the key aspects of his cinematic genius.

","I never liked this movie. It's based on a book I have not read yet, I've never found it for sale, so I can not judge if it was true to the book. However, most people seem to have a consensual opinion that this movie is brilliant and one of the best ever made. It's a nuisance movie in its very nature, as it tackles too brutal themes. It basically speaks of extreme violence and the possible ways to control it through brainwashing and absolute control over people. It's a world that no one really wants to see. If violence is something we condemn, extreme violence is disgusting. The total conditioning of a person reminds us of the times of slavery and the man as object. These are ideas that our civilization, at great cost, has learned to hate, but we all won with it. These themes would make an excellent movie and this movie would have been great if it did not overdo it all through barbarically graphic and unnecessary scenes! And the film gets worse as it shows to the public plentiful bursting and destruction, accompanied - surprise, or perhaps not - by scenes of nudity and almost explicit sex. Stanley Kubrick filled the vast majority of his films with generous doses of blood and semen. He has always seemed obsessed with all this, and I am sure that Freud would make a rather interesting analysis of that, so why would it be different in his ""magnum opus""? In the midst of all this monument to madness, we must recognize that the film tackles a complex subject and has an interesting history, although it is so abject that it ends up not worth the effort to watch. Perhaps in the future someone with courage will remake this movie in a more restrained manner, without exaggerate. We also emphasized Malcolm McDowell's excellent performance. The actor, still relatively young, went to the limit, accepting things that I, in his shoes, would not accept, and manage to maintained the interpretive level and shine. For this, he deserves congratulations.<br/><br/>From the point of view of detail and technique, its possible that this is one of the best films ever made. But we are too shocked to notice and appreciate. And the truth is that cinema is not only technique. The audience does not fill the theater to admire the way the camera moves, the color and light of cinematography, the quality of characterization. The essence of any movie is the story told and, in this case, it's the story of a nightmare. Does the conception of a cinematographic work of art need, necessarily, to shock or cause erections? In the past, art was beauty and perfection, and I still think of art in that way. Does art now have to be deformed, sexual, pornographic and bloody? Is this art the pale reflection of our barbaric society or is merely the reflection of the apparently distorted mind of its creator?"

","I know that movies are a matter of tastes and I respect that, but frankly I can't understand all the praise towards this movie. Its ""out of this world"" plot? Its peculiar visuals? Its strong contents? Whatever the reason is, one thing is for sure: there seems to be very few people who dislike this. I'm one of them.<br/><br/>I've been trying to watch this movie for a long time, after hearing so many good things about it. Today I finally did.<br/><br/>Well, for one thing, this is a satirical, shocking and disturbing movie. People should know that: it is a violent movie (sometimes, extremely violent) and it has strong sexual contents (even in artistic shapes), as well as nudity. Besides the nudity itself, this movie shows some rape scenes and sexual violence. This is not a pleasant movie to watch, neither comfortable, although it has the power to impress.<br/><br/>Anyway, when this movie initially came out in 1971, it was extremely controversial for being too violent. In fact, it was banned from UK cinemas and nearly caused serious trouble for the director Stanley Kubrick. This movie was hidden for 29 years and only went to the theaters after all that time (after Kubrick's death in 1999). This movie was more than controversial at the time, it was a scandal. A similar situation happened with the 1969 song ""Je t'aime... moi non plus"" (by Serge Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin), although in the case of this song it wasn't for violence, but for sexual references and sounds of orgasms. Its video was forbidden and the song itself too, but later it was accepted (and it is a great song).<br/><br/>For a movie from 1971, its visuals are original, eccentric and futuristic. In fact, it takes place in a futuristic dystopian society (somewhere in England). This is a positive point. And the soundtrack is great, consisting in classical music - mostly by Ludwing Van Beethoven, or simply «Ludwig Van», like the character Alex says. The dialogs are very interesting, especially because many of them are narrated by Alex. This is also a very energetic movie, with a level of energy comparable to ""Dog Day Afternoon"".<br/><br/>The character Alex is brilliantly portrayed by Malcolm McDowell. He's the movie's main character, a mentally very sick person who loves to rape, kill people and hurt them very badly with the use of extensive violence. Alex and his ""droogs"" somehow remind me about the musical band Culture Club with their way to dress and looks. Alex, for example, does look a bit like Boy George, doesn't he? At least in the beginning. Alex, however, after ""curing"" himself, becomes a victim and pays for his own crimes.<br/><br/>The movie has its brilliant things, but it also becomes too long and tiring when Alex begins his ""cure"". From that part on the movie almost never seems to end. I liked, however, the part when Alex and his ""droogs"" steal a sports car for a reckless drive into the countryside. That part is crazy and brilliantly done.<br/><br/>This is a very weird and bizarre movie, one that is difficult to ""stomach"". But for those who can ""stomach"" it, it will be an extraordinary movie experience. The title is weird too, although it might have something to do with Alex - his instincts, the way he functions is like a clockwork orange."

","This is by far the greatest movie I have ever seen in my life. I love it. Malcolm McDowell is so amazing in it. They could not have picked a better lead man. Every little detail in this movie is a work of art. I love the colors, the characters, and the dialogue. Every thing is just so perfectly put together. Even though the movie was made back in the seventies it still captures audiences everywhere. This is a classic. I would put it in the same category as Vertigo and other classics before it. I wish they made more movies like this today, but I'm sure if they tried they would probably fail. This movie was definitely a trip and i think that everyone should see it sometime in their life.

","I've wanted to watch this one for a long time now, especially after all the reviews i heard from my fellow friends from the film school. Kubrick's work has always been unquestionable but this one stands out from the rest in the most classic, unique and artistic manner. The first scene of this movie introduces you to the director's vision and the accent is very catchy. Malcolm McDowell is Alex for all that he does in the movie. The music blends in fantastically and the lighting is something I can go on and on about. A very noticeable attribute for this movie would be that every scene is divided - more of different short stories but connected to one character which links them all. The jail house scene is my favorite. As writers one would tend to overlook small details which have been taken care of here as the jailer describes all of Alex's belongings. Procedural scripting and amazing lights is what makes the movie. The performances are out of this world and the rape scenes turn you on. I don't think i've seen a movie so complete before."

It was pretty strong stuff (the original rating was X in the US and it was banned completely in Britain) and introduced the term ""ultraviolence"" into our language. I loved it all the times I saw it in the 1980s (at least 7 times). I did think it was sexist (notice the decor at the bar) but found the ideas and themes fascinating.<br/><br/>Seen now it's very dated. The violence in it is not even remotely shocking anymore and the ideas and ultimate message in the film (which totally changes the ending of the book) are old hat by now. To put in bluntly the film bores me now. It is extremely well made by Kubrick (the sequence with the ""William Tell Overture"" was great and how can you resist Beethoeven?) and powerfully acted (McDowell was just perfect) but it drags and I'm more bored than anything by it now. Perhaps I saw it too much in the 80s...<br/><br/>I'm giving it a 7--for its time it was very powerful...sadly, it just doesn't hold up. <br/><br/>And I know I'm going to hear from those Kubrick fanatics who thinks everything he did was genius (even ""The Shining"").

He is sent to jail, but after a few years he is offered a way out, all he has to do is participate in a little experiment... This is supposed to make him a good man, but will it really work without any dangerous side-effects?<br/><br/> This is one of Stanley Kubrick´s most famous movies, and also the most provocative.

But Kubrick and McDowell actually pull this off, with their great directing and acting respectively.<br/><br/> The movie takes place in the near future, but it more feels like it takes place in the seventies or something. It´s not quite enough to throw in some daft furniture and clothing. The futuristic music succeeds better with setting the tone, this is probably one of the better soundtracks I´ve heard.<br/><br/>The script contains some corny dialogue, and the movie is probably not as provocative as it was when it was released.

","I'm not sure how Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange"" ended up such an overrated movie. It's mind-boggingly juvenile and I could find no apparent reason to justify the constant violence and sex in the movie. The story was weak to begin with and I think it may have gotten its original appeal from the shock value it created. The problem is that 30 years of escalating violence later, the shock value is lost and you end up with a movie that seems more like a half-hearted retelling of the fantasy life of the average geeky adolescent boy. Of course, the movie does have the Kubrick name attached to it so that could also explain some of the hype since so many of his other films were truly excellent. In the end, after all of the hype, ""A Clockwork Orange"" is a huge disappointment."

"tczech9","10","2","5","21 July 2016"," Artistic and Satirically Unmatched
","Oh, my little brothers, this film was an artistically wild ride. From start to finish, this tale of a dystopian British future was continually shocking and left the hairs on its audience's chins erected full-fold in utter disturbance and disbelief. The opening scene pictures a group of four 'droogs': Alex, their leader; Georgie, Alex's subsequent adversary; Dim, a beetle-brained follower; Pete, a silent disciple of whoever his superior happens to be conveniently. The droogs relax at a sexually obscene milk bar where they drink substance- laced dairy and discuss how they fancy to spend their evenings, usually boiling their decisions down to some form of ""ultra-violence."" Whether it involves rape, assault, or simply vandalism, the teenage hoodlums embark on quests to please themselves at any cost and commit any heinous crime regardless of the consequences they ensue. Despite receiving death threats and warrants on his and his family's lives, Stanley Kubrick decided to allow American theaters to air ""A Clockwork Orange."" Due to its constant explicit material and violent spurts of rape and murder, this movie garnered fear in the UK's citizens and eventually, and rightfully so, received the rare 'X' rating, a step above 'R,' from the MPAA. What many fail to understand, possibly because of the undeviating sadism in the film, is the subliminal message and satirical undertone that it entails. Many people choose to interpret the themes of this movie differently. Personally, I like to use a quote from one of Kubrick's later films, ""Full Metal Jacket,"" to help understand the concept of experimentation in coherence with Alex's character throughout the film. In FMJ, Private Joker, played by Matthew Modine, wears a button engraved with a peace sign, contrasting his helmet which reads ""born to kill."" When asked why he wears two accessories with opposite messages, he replies ""I think I was trying to suggest something about the duality of man, sir."" What Joker is trying to portray is how man can be both good and evil, yet as we see the events in FMJ unfold, we see how one side often times may outweigh the other. As I was watching ""A Clockwork Orange,"" I noticed a similar character path in Alex. While in FMJ the dividing line was the Vietnam conflict, the authoritarian experimental government examined in A Clockwork Orange plays the same role. After undergoing treatment for his criminal, epidemic behavior, Alex no longer has the choice to perform acts of evil, and that inevitably brings into question freedom of choice. However, as the film progresses, Alex continues his will to act out, even though he physically cannot carry out his wish. Eventually, he attempts suicide and the final scene of the movie depicts him amiably flirting with the very government that took away his freedom in the first place, all while having rugged sexual intercourse in his mind. What this proves is how the root of each human being will prevail, in spite of any attempts, whether personal or otherwise, to alter the soul. Being an early 70's film, this theme was created in such a bizarre, repugnantly imaginative manner that it achieved its goal to prove that society and humanity have unsolvable issues using a fascinating futuristic contrast. Final decision: 10/10."
"pere-25366","9","2","5","10 July 2016"," What a glorious feeling, I'm happy again!
","Out of all the Kubrick masterpieces I have seen, A Clockwork Orange had the greatest impact on me. Firstly, the film is a visual treat for the eyes. Kubrick's meticulousness to every detail is manifest, visually striking with its futuristic feel and surreal imagery. The set pieces were among the best I've seen in a movie and beautifully captured the movie's essence.<br/><br/>While labelled a dystopian film, there is an undeniable Black Comedy element to it as well. Whether it was our ""friend and humble narrator"" presenting his 'rendition' of ""Singin' In the Rain"", propositioning a couple of women at the record store or even the mere conversations he would have with his ""droogs"", the humour was always a perfect contrast to the difficult subject matter being depicted throughout.<br/><br/>What more can be said of Malcolm McDowell's breathtaking turn as the charismatic hooligan of young Alex DeLarge? As the narrator, protagonist and antihero, Alex is an ultra- violent sociopath who assaults people for sheer satisfaction. Violence is the engine that fuels this enigmatic man. This is why his quasi-transformed self is all the more astonishing, and allows McDowell to show off his immense versatility as an actor.<br/><br/>While watching the film, I couldn't help but notice many connections between ACO and Breaking Bad. So I did my research and it turns out other people have too noticed the similitude. Mr. Alexander, in his final appearance, closely resembling that of drug runner Hector Salamanca being one. The scene of Walt casually strolling around in the home of Gretchen and Elliott Schwartz to the echo of classical music likely alluding to the Beethoven music torture scene. And of course, the unmistakable parallels between each of our anti- heros. Each so dark and morally questionable, fuelled by violence and the fear they instill in others. Not since Walter White had I met such a fascinating character with the uncanny ability to delude himself about the truth of his actions. With both W.W. and Alex DeLarge, you find yourself hating that you love them. Their evolution is so out of character, and yet you can't help but root for them because they are, quite frankly, so damn badass. But most of all neither, in the end, really transformed at all."

"evandewangga97","9","2","5","14 January 2015"," True Piece of Art
","We will never expect what Kubrick would made. But, when he directed in his own universe, one for sure is we must be shocked and astonished. Whether you are Kubrick's fan or not, you won't forget every work of his hand. So do the controversial ""A Clockwork Orange"", you can really define wonderful world of Kubrick thought by this very movie. It's also a great idea of Anthony Burgess, the novelist who wrote it. A pile of great literature served on the table of motion picture, in the teenage age of movie industry. That abstract combination is just the base of this art. I mean, you can't really understand what it could mean. Just watch it and translate it with your own mind, don't worry with the interpretation. The Kubrick's point is to entertain audiences with their comprehension, not his ideology or critic's opinion. Honestly, it's the first Kubrick's movie I have watched, and it leads me to characterize who is he.<br/><br/>Let's jump to the story. It's hard to believe the cinematic effect of this movie in 1971. A real movie that you can watch in every aspect of it, such as its cinematography, settings, and strong- character. In one hand, the plot is so vivid, that you can choke all the scene entertainingly. The rape, classic ""ultraviolence"", and all the slang. Masterpiece of dialog in this ""disturbing"" movie. A bunch full of sex-scene that shocked the entire movie fan that day even until now, but it's all make sense for the art of movie, the very bold violence. In the other hand, it's very abstract, just like the other Kubrick's work. The director often erase some important points from the novel just to make interesting effects, which is ignorance, puzzlement, yet amazement. For all impressionist, you can get very excited by its uncommon way to impress audiences. This is the point I say that it is indeed a true piece of art, no censor, vulgarity, or taboo thing, just the original amusement with its dark beauty. Comedy about blackness that isn't mark society, instead just to fulfill the art requirement. Not for the audiences who seek moral value, but suitable for you who want to criticize moral.<br/><br/>It is divided into to part. I named it, the first is the ""ultraviolence"", and the second is the ""therapy"". Both of them has shadowy chasing with nasty core. The ""ultraviolence"" is dreadful as is, with the construction of awful figure. I advise, don't be to confuse, in spite of being innocent yet follower of each scene. There is no taboo here. The ""therapy"", is just a simple conclusion that everyone could imagine. But the latent effects of this ""therapy"" is logical as Kubrick had ever done. It makes sense in the end, a simply undefined movie. It's rather a fantasy than a science- fiction, because it's so absurd, pleasantly imaginative. So surrealist, with Beethoven as the background-music. Fast motion and other effects, just to form the entire amazing sequence.<br/><br/>Yeah, it's easy on its skin, but dark inside. A movie that is really disturbingly unforgettable. Great art."
"powermandan","10","2","5","18 December 2014"," Bizarre and Brilliant.
","Stanley Kubrick created a deranged adaptation of Anthony Burgess' novella of the same name. The film has since become one of the most controversial pictures ever released and has become to me one of the best movies I have ever seen.<br/><br/>What makes this so controversial is the explicit violence and sexual content. The violence is more barbaric (which includes torture) than a cheesy 80s action movie with Sylvester Stallone, and the sex (mostly rape) is also all out with the most rape I have seen in a feature film. The movie is about Alex (McDowell) and his Droods who rape, torture and rob people for kicks. But what makes this so bizarre is the way Kubrick tackled the look of a futuristic-dystopian England. The set pieces to gain a future look are greatly weird and the ones to gain a dystopian look (mostly dealing with sex) are even weirder. So Kubrick knocked the look out of the park.<br/><br/>What makes this great is the character study of Alex and his delivery by Malcolm McDowell. He plays such an evil character with such a cool look and vibe to him that you can't help but be sympathetic. He's not one to feel sorry for (right away), but he still has that ""cool"" factor. Roughly half-way through the movie, he is betrayed by his Droods and is sent to prison. There, he is shown disturbing videos along with music parallel to his own crimes. He is released completely changed and must deal with the hellacious aftermaths crimes he committed. The study of Alex is an evil individual that is changed to a normal person by the government; a regular person with a mechanical mind. A theme that could be used is ""sorry not cutting it"" (not sure of a proper term for this) because he is changed but still must pay for all the wrong he did. The general structure and change is similar to Robert De Niro in Raging Bull and Edward Norton in American History X. So I totally loved McDowell's performance in this. Difference is, Alex is simply psychotic, whereas De Niro and Norton where driven by anger and personal demons. So Alex is scarier because he has no real reason to do what he does. When he changes, he becomes hugely sympathetic. Thing is, that's not him. He has no control over being good. At the end, he is ""cured,"" reverting back to his evil self as the government is faulted and Alex is sent to be changed back. But the end is not fully explained, so it is very ambiguous and requires analyzing.<br/><br/>The way that society and psychology is used in this is flat-out amazing. The performance by McDowell is a rarity and the story is astonishing. This is not an easy view, but it is one that is needed.<br/><br/>4/4"

You'll feel sorry for him and you're not blaming this poor little boy anymore. And by the end you can see how happy Alex is and you feel a strange satisfaction running through your body. <br/><br/>I think this movie means different things to people. I know for example a friend of mine enjoyed it because the absurd amount of naked women (or exposed breasts). Another one disliked it because he was sickened by all the violence. I personally loved it because I can somehow relate to the main character.

","One of the first things that will strike anyone watching ""A Clockwork Orange"" today is how thoroughly modern it looks. If not for the presence of the youthful face of established thespian Malcolm McDowell, one could be forgiven the assumption that the movie was made far more recently than 1971. Unlike many of its contemporaries, ""A Clockwork Orange"" is in no way dated, and the issues it addresses are as urgent today as they were three decades ago. How many other films from the early '70s can make this statement?<br/><br/>Applying his own distinctive visual style to Burgess' future dystopia, Kubrick's movie hit the sensibilities of UK cinema-goers like a sledgehammer. Its design had an immediate impact on contemporary culture, with the central image of a trussed-up Malcolm McDowell, his eyes prised open, one of the most arresting in 20th century cinema.<br/><br/>A simple tale at heart, ""A Clockwork Orange"" introduces Alex and his little coterie of droogs, a violently amoral gang that enjoys inflicting violence for its own sake, particularly after a few glasses of intoxicating milk plus. <br/><br/>Like Burgess' novel, Kubrick's movie is related in three distinct parts. In the first, we glimpse an average twenty-four hours in Alex's life, which comprises rape, violence against rival gangs and innocent people, and a side order of Beethoven. Alex's betrayal by his embittered gang members and his subsequent imprisonment ultimately leads to his willing participation in the Ludovico Technique, a kind of aversion therapy that causes him to retch helplessly at the mere thought of violence or sex. Released back into the wild in the third act, Alex's inability to defend himself leaves him vulnerable to abuse from all quarters, including his old droogs (who have now been assimilated into society as brutal members of the police), and an eccentric writer who attempts to force him to commit suicide by playing Beethoven at full blast.<br/><br/>Like the book, Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange"" is a meditation on the notion of free will and morality (Kubrick himself described it as ""a running lecture on free will""). It's worth noting, however, that Kubrick's adaptation actually tones down some of the more violent excesses of Burgess' book, with the underage girls Alex encounters in the original text made considerably older for the film. Nevertheless, there's an irreverent, blackly comic tone to Kubrick's film, and it's this that I suspect audiences were most shocked and surprised by.<br/><br/>It's a film that makes you ponder and question, like most great films do. It questions the ethics of choice and the human mind. It's one of the most controversial films and books ever, but it's still worth checking out."

","A Clockwork Orange is a movie based on Anthony Burgess's novel of the same title. To many, it is considered a fantastic work of art and Stanley Kubrick(director) at his finest. It tells the tale, in the first person, of a young lad named Alex deLarge(Malcolm McDowell). This young man is about fifteen years old and is a fan and avid participant of ultra-violence, which is an unprovoked act of violence purely for the entertainment of himself and his ""droogs."" Droog is a word that transposes to friend in their slang they use called ""nadsat."" These acts of ultra-violence are quite brutal, but are contrasted against classical scores, such as Beethoven, which disturbingly make them seem almost comical. We follow Alex through his life committing these acts and living highly until he is set up by his droogs one night, arrested for murder, and sent to a detention center. There, he becomes part of a program that makes him physically sick to hurt anyone. After he finishes the program, he is considered cured and released. He returns home to find that his parents don't want him and is put out on the streets. He encounters almost everyone he had wronged, including his former droogs, who all seek their revenge. He returns to one of his victims' house, who recognizes him and locks him upstairs, driving him mad with music until he can no longer take it and attempts suicide by jumping out of the window. He survives and receives medical attention, including a surgery that ""cures"" him from his pains. The government is blamed for his suicide attempt, claiming the program and his treatment to cure him was inhumane. They make a deal, give him a job, and take care of him. This movie does an incredible job at making the audience sympathize with the narrator, and almost making light of terrible acts of violence. It's hard to decide if it is he, or the government who is the hero or the villain."

Every single scene is packed with multiple layers and meaning: watch it just for the lighting, or the sound track, the camera angles, or speed (slow-mo to high). Watch it as purely political fable, science fiction, horror story, comedy, or even love story (between Alex and Beethoven). Watch it for character development. Watch it purely for its art historical view (from the Renaissance through 19th century Romanticism to post modern, modern, pop, and kitsch (Velvet paintings?). Watch it for the costuming. Watch it for its take on architecture even, for chrissakes. Themes range from government control to free will, religious zealotry, Pavlovian conditioning, the welfare state, youth versus old age, political and police state corruption, education, linguistic evolution, penal reform, depression era economics (boarders anyone?), gang psychology, sexuality (rape, homosexuality, menage a trois, voyeurism), and even Biblical interpretation. There are so many cultural references and cross linkages it's mind boggling.<br/><br/>The film is even more amazing when you discover it was made in less than a year, was low budget, and filmed almost entirely on location.<br/><br/>A testament to collaborative genius: Beethoven, Kubrick, Burgess, and Malcolm McDowell. I defy you to find a movie where every single frame can be stopped, analyzed, and discussed on every possible cinematic level.<br/><br/>It's well known that Kubrick would take dozens of takes and solicited comments and recommendations from everyone on the set including the security guys. In this way, he packed the film with so many details and irony that it's nearly impossible to absorb them all in one sitting. It's enlightening to discover that Kubrick was a still photographer before becoming a film maker. Thus, he was used to thinking and blocking out each scene as a static frame rife with meaning before adding time and action for the fourth dimension.<br/><br/>Oh, and did I mention? it's damn good entertainment.<br/><br/>Watch and be warned."

Only the third word is spot-on - the rest is, at best, an example of bitter irony. How come? Because the only one who could possibly find the events of this film funny or exciting is the deranged protagonist, Alex DeLarge (Malcolm McDowell). Actually, ""deranged"" is the wrong adjective to use with him: ""paradoxical"" is better. And what's so paradoxical about this young man? Well, he's intelligent and cheerful, with a soft spot for ""the divine work of Ludwig Van"", as he calls Beethoven, and enjoys hanging out with his friends (or ""droogs""). The problem is, his idea of spending time is best summed up by an expression he uses in the chilling opening sequence, where the camera catches his insane stare and goes backwards to reveal the bizarre pub he's visiting: ""a bit of the old ultra-violence"". He's never perfectly happy unless he can beat, rape or (in one extreme case) kill someone. Everything appears to change when he's sent to jail for murder and undergoes a treatment that makes him completely incapable to commit violent or perverted acts ever again. However, this ""cure"" is a double-edged sword, as it also means he can't defend himself when his victims come back for revenge.<br/><br/>It's the second section that constitutes the real heart of A Clockwork Orange. Much has been said about the film's use of on-screen violence and how it supposedly affected people upon its original release in 1971 (protests led to it being banned in England until the director's death) , and while it must have been a shock back then, most of the incriminated scenes look rather tame today (see Bonnie and Clyde for a similar argument). The notable exception is the famous brainwash sequence, which will probably never lose its sheer emotional power. That's because it represents Kubrick's real concern: the loss of free will, which will eventually turn all of us into mindless drones and lead to nothing but tragedy (the latrine shootout in Full Metal Jacket derives from this). The film was shot so that it would appear to be set in a not-so-distant future, but in a time where the media manipulate unsuspecting viewers and listeners every day, it is clear that the director saw it happening and tried to warn us. The use of violence was an inevitable part of this: the stronger the message, the more effective the reception.<br/><br/>This strength comes not only from the haunting images and the terrifying irony (Alex sings ""Singin' In The Rain"", the ultimate feel-good tune, while raping a woman), but also and most prominently from the groundbreaking central performance: McDowell, almost a complete unknown at the time (not to mention pushing 30, while Alex is supposed to be something like ten years younger), seized the opportunity and delivered a portrait of absolute, unmatched evil, so powerful it is sadly obvious why he hasn't done anything as astounding since. Anthony Hopkins may have won an Oscar for playing a serial killer, but it was McDowell who forever raised the bar for cinematic inhumanity.<br/><br/>Overall, A Clockwork Orange is like any other film by Kubrick: it has to be seen multiple times before its full significance can be grasped, it will upset and infuriate some, and it's an experience like few others. For its unprecedented boldness as to content and delivery, it is also the great director's best picture."

","This is a movie which is ahead of its time, both literally as figuratively. If you watch it, you really wouldn't put the year 1971 on it. We have to thank Stanley Kubrick for this. His (r)evolutionary ideas have been of most importance for the movie industry. He taught directors how they could break all rules, and so much more. For one, the cinematography is totally new and brings a whole new dimension to movies. Prove: the first scene... woooooooooooow! This could very well be the best opening scene ever. Stanley Kubrick is also one of the first directors who really cared about the meaning of music in a movie. It really gives you that violent feeling, love it! But the reason I watch this one over and over again is Alex. In my list of all-time favorite characters, he would definitely be in the top 5. The energy that goes out from him (probably caused by the milk-plus) is very, very intense and masterfully brought forward by Malcolm McDowell. This movie is complete, it has no lacks... so 10/10."

","""If a man cannot choose, he ceases to be a man.""

Macdowell gives on of the greatest performances of all time. Unforgettable images, startling musical counterpoints (which is apparent and vital in pretty much all of Kubrick's films), the fascinating language used by Alex and his pals-Kubrick shapes them into a shattering whole.

","This, was in fact, a very strange movie. But, it is worth watching; not only for the outrageous characters, but the way Stanley Kubrick directed. While watching the violence, along with a tune of ""Singin' in the Rain"", I couldn't help but laugh. I do admit that this film is disturbing at points, but very tender in others, a spectrum that Kubrick is good at exploiting. <br/><br/>Malcom McDowell was excellent in the cast playing Alex, the deranged teen and crazed maniac. The entire film reminded me of the 'Monty Python' group, that is, the narration was reminiscent. And on a highlight, when released, garnered an 'X' rating, and an Academy Award nomination. One of very few to do so. <br/><br/>I was surprised at the artistic value of the film when I viewed it, and was not sure what kind of rating it would receive. Afterwards though, I knew it deserved the best, so 10 of 10."

","A Clockwork Orange, like many ""cult"" films, is a bit of a problem for film buffs. Whether it's good or bad tends to get lost under its iconic, pseudo-hip status. Fans quote its quirky dialogue, delight in the overt violence and sexuality and marvel over its philosophical message-making, but if that were all there was to it Clockwork Orange would be a pretty poor film.<br/><br/>Clockwork Orange is perhaps the most extreme example of the Kubrick technical style  a kind of formal method which instantly distinguishes his films. And bizarrely, it's all based around the game of chess. While he had by now dropped all the actual references to the game which peppered his earliest films, Kubrick had begun directing as if he were playing chess. Look at the camera movements. With a few exceptions, the camera only moves as if it was a chess piece  forwards, backwards, left and right. The actors also move like opposing chess pieces, more often than not directly towards the camera or across the shot.<br/><br/>Kubrick was always meticulous and extravagant in conveying an idea and an atmosphere not just through performances but through set and costume design, sound, music and lighting. In the first part of Clockwork Orange (the first half-hour or so, up until Alex is arrested) every aspect of every shot expresses the collision between formal sophistication and crude roughness. So we have violent youngsters wearing bowler hats, the mural with penises grafittied onto it, classical music played on synthesisers and so on. It's a world full of images we recognise, but is at the same time as deliberately outlandish as possible. Compare this to the next section of the film, in the prison, where everything becomes realistic and contemporary, although the atmosphere is equally unnerving.<br/><br/>Clockwork Orange also represents the peak of the growing musical dimension of Kubrick's films. It is what the director Michael Powell referred to as a composed film  one where the images play out like a piece of music. As I've hinted at above it's structured in contrasting ""movements"" which reference and counterpoint each other, like a classical symphony. However there's also the musical element to individual scenes. The scene, fifteen or so minutes in, in which Alex returns to his bedroom to listen to Beethoven's 9th is one of the best examples in cinema of image and music working together  the quick zoom onto the Beethoven poster as the piece begins, then the prowling downward scan in the following shot, followed by the staccato cuts of details of the dancing Jesuses ornament are simply perfect.<br/><br/>A Clockwork Orange, like all of Kubrick's later films, is incredibly elaborate and painstaking in the way it is constructed. It's not quite the classic it's reputed to be, and the statement it makes about free will isn't really all that profound. It is entertaining though, and in spite of what I said in the first paragraph, you can't help but like that memorable, poetic Nadsat dialogue."

","Let me start with a little  autobiographical information. One day, I wanted to see ""A Clockwork Orange"" because I heard it was an awesome movie. But, I decided it would be more spiritually rewarding to read the book before I watched the movie. At this same time, I was assigned a research paper for English class, and I decided to do it on ""A Clockwork Orange"". So, I read ""A Clockwork Orange"" in detail, studied the Nadsat language of the malchicks'. I read criticisms, more criticms, analytical essays. And then, I decide, ah gee, I'm going to watch this movie. And yes, I am an avid movie watcher and I claim to know what I'm talking about when I say this or more correctly write this. Stanley Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange"" is a perversion of the novel. He deep down wanted to make a porn and decided he's going to interject it within the story of ""A Clockwork Orange"". What was the point of the sexually explicit material? There is no connection between it and the novel by Anthony Burgess. There wasn't sex in his story, there was rape and the ravaging of innocence. There was nothing sexy about it. So why then do these big chested, curvy Playboy bunny-type women ""get raped"" with little to no struggle (I think one assisted in taking her clothes off) and in the book they are 10-11 year old girls who have yet to have big breasts and gorgeous hips. A minor detail overlooked by a director's arrogant vision. And then there's the old lady who is brutally attacked (then murdered) by Alex. Very old and decrepid in the book with no capability of defending herself except with her copious amounts of cats (I think I saw five in the movie, in the book there was like twenty). In the movie she is limber, probably early 50's and is killed by a giant phallic symbol. In the book, it was a bust of Beethoven. It was so significant to have the music destroy this lady, not this huge phallus. What is the point? The point is, o my brothers, is that Kubrick I believe is a sexist man who wants his victimized women to be dominated by large maleness (aka ceramic phallus). I will admit one thing good that this movie accomplished, the comedic tone of the book. The lightness of the language and Malcom MacDowell captured the humor well, BUT he was too old to be Alex. Alex is fifteen which makes it all the more CREEPIER. The actors were too old to  be playing a gang of teenagers. Hmm, what else....oh yes the violence and the underlying theme of freedom of choice. The violence, not at all shocking, but then again I've grown up to ""pulp fiction"". Not that I need the in-your-face style, but I think that's what Kubrick was going for. He doesn't leave it for the imagination, but fails at providing grotesque imagery that would make you feel sickened by the violence. And the freedom of choice, yes the prison chaplain has his famous line, but I think the ultimate point of this movie is lost in once again Kubrick's obsession with sex. If you want Kubrick-directed naked people I suggest ""Eyes Wide SHut"". At least then I get the point. But here, he fails. He doesn't do enough justice to the book. He strays from the Anthony Burgess's vision too far. Sure, it's more faithful than a lot of Hollywood's book adaptations, but it could have been done so much better. This book was practically begging to be made into a movie with it's already picked-out soundtrack. But I honestly feel that if people read the book before jumping on the hype band wagon back in the '70's, we wouldn't look at this movie with such awe."

","A Clockwork Orange, hailed as one of the greatest films of all time, is nothing more than an attempt to shock the audience.

I realize I'm watching this sick guy, but I stop caring about midway through the movie.  Don't get me wrong, I am not easily offended. But I do recognize when a movie is simply trying to offend the audience for the sake of offending, as this movie does over and over and over again.

"oli-reed","10","2","6","20 October 2014"," A statement on ALL (Analysis)
","Upon first viewing this film (the first of Kubrick's work I had seen) the film, though visually striking and eerily violent I didn't understand the significance of what the film was trying to convey and was unsure whether the film's 'crusification' of the main protagonist (Alex) was enough to redeem him for the horrors he had committed. Despite Malcolm McDowell playing the part with undeniable and magnetic charisma, the character he plays is an archetype of young gang criminals, finding an elevation of meaning in the crimes they commit in contrast to their otherwise seemingly dim lives.<br/><br/>Alex's gang choose to hang around in a crudely stylish milk bar, where they even see local sophisticates. This bar is symbolic of societies inadvertent encouragement of such behaviour of violence attracting though sex represented through it. The author of the films source material (novel of the same name) chooses the language of the gangs to be a distinct style called 'Nadsat'. Just like gangs in this day and age deviating from common tongue in favour of their own language games, he chooses to immortalise this idea using Nadsat's Shakespearian and Cockney inspired speak and continues the idea of the gangs self- glorification. The gang will cause havoc and continue to assert their superiority and dominance, whether it be against other gangs, on the road or where it is most brutal - through physical violence through sexual abuse and GBH.<br/><br/>Having said this, the film is not just about the brutality of these gangs. A common misconception is that the film is of gangs, and although this is the case, it is as much a critique of society breeding this culture as it is of gang violence. Alex's house is shown to be scattered with litter and even has the ascetic of being abandoned, showing negligence of such areas he lives in from the state. In this working class environment, Alex's father seems to involved with work to care what he is up to and has given up on him, whilst his Mother (though more caring) lulls herself into believing the lies of her son, playing ignorance to live a happy family fantasy. The social worker of Alex's (if you can call him that) is more worried about his reputation and career (similar to Alex's father) than Alex, pressuring him to stop using intimidation and mild violence rather than truly empathising with him. Mr Alexander (the middle class liberal writer) is fine with Alex despite his previous crimes; lulled over by the potential to ruin the politician involved with his treatment and treats him kindly, willing to help until personal prejudice gets in the way, vindictively turning Alex into a sacrificial lamb for his cause despite his beliefs. This is a critique on people's moral stance differing once personal prejudice is involved. The police are shown at their worst as unnecessarily violent. What is interesting is towards the end of the film, revealing Alex's old gang as police, suggesting that policing is an outlet for violent people that is justified by the law, and that these black uniforms (contrasting with the white gang colour) are gang colours themselves.<br/><br/>However, the most obvious critique is the states choice to 'treat' Alex in a different way not as an genuinely motivated treatment, but a cost saving method to save on prison space (in spite of its consequences). Their view is monetary and political more than anything else, directly opposed by the reverends view of it all. Possibly the most moral voice in the film, he is not against the new treatment because it allows criminals to get out quicker - which annoys the police just as much - but because it removes the social and spiritual purpose of prison; true rehabilitation. With Alex's new condition, it removes his choice of right and wrong and takes that opportunity away from him, instead offering him pain whenever he exhibits violence; forcing him to do the opposite. When this is shown to an audience, the prison guard smiles as it has still served his original intention through prison; pain, whilst the reverend detests it and pities Alex not for what he is, but what he has now become.<br/><br/>A Clockwork Orange is a masterpiece ahead of its time, which holds up even today as one of cinema's finest achievements."

","A film like ""A Clockwork Orange"" is very hard to bare. With subject matter of this film, it's hard not to. But there is something about ""A Clockwork Orange"" that pushes it to the edge on a psychological level. It's a misanthropic view of humanity's need to be controlled, and the need for freedom, a ""balance"" that needs to be made. It's a film that definitely will leave audiences in uncomfortable states of mind, but that is exactly what Stanley Kubrick wanted, and it worked perfectly.<br/><br/>""A Clockwork Orange"" is about a young criminal named Alex DeLarge who has a lust for ""ultraviolence,"" and engages in the dirtiest of the dirtiest of crimes, assault, rape, murder, violent acts are what get Alex off. <br/><br/>After being caught, he is placed in an experimental program where they ""sensitize"" Alex to the concepts of violence and rape, and the crippled mindset and life he is left.<br/><br/>It's hard to find where to start with this film, it's, to a person like me, a perfect film. It gets an incredible emotional rise out of the viewers, and it's intellectually stimulating. It asks deep questions about human nature and society, questioning where the border between human free will and human control should be placed. Anthony Burgess is an incredible story teller.<br/><br/>The story originally written by Anthony Burgess is the back bone of what helped shaped the hopeful beginnings for this film. The story is perfect, especially for a cinematic style like Stanley Kubrick. The story is engaging for the audience, and is intellectually stimulating, questioning the boundaries between human control and human freedom.<br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick is an incredible filmmaker. He has visions of pure genius, and knows exactly how to move his audience, and he does it perfectly with ""A Clockwork Orange."" He shows you the filth of humanity, and he's not afraid to push your feelings to the boundaries. This is the kind of story that HAD to be made by Stanley Kubrick to be as good as it is, a story as intense as ""A Clockwork Orange"" deserves to be handled by an intense filmmaker. <br/><br/>Malcom McDowell's performance of Alex is excellent. He portrays a cold, lifeless, power hungry, psychopathic criminal with a scary charm, a perfect performance for such a twisted character.<br/><br/>The cinematography is unbelievable. A great use of color, and great composition in nearly every shot, very common traits of Stanley Kubrick's films. The cinematography in this film reminds me of the photographic work of William Eggleston for some reason (at least some of his work). In Kubrick's black and white films, he reminds me more of Robert Frank. The opening shot of this film is a perfect example of Kubrick's great visual style. It starts as a close up on Alex's face, him staring deeply into the camera, not even blinking. As he starts to drink milk we track away from him to see his droogs and the rest of the milk bar that he is in. This was an incredible opening shot for the film, it establishes the fear we should have towards the main character Alex, and gives us a bit of a peek as to whats to come in this film. This shot is great synchronized to ""Funeral of Queen Mary.""<br/><br/>The music choice is unbelievable. The synthesized version of ""Funeral For Queen Mary"" was an interesting choice for a theme song for the film, and Beethoven's 9th Symphony is always an excellent listen, but the contrast between Alex's violence and his love of Beethoven is an interesting clash of ideas. There is a lot of great classical music in this film, there is a lot of Rossini as well. And, not to mention, I always found the song ""I Want To Marry A Lighthouse Keeper"" rather humorous.<br/><br/>One of the most interesting things about this film is the parallels that this film presents. It shows a clash between ideas:<br/><br/>Alex and his ""droogs"" are older (late high school perhaps), but wear a gang uniform that looks just like a baby in diapers. And of course, their love of milk is an interesting trait.<br/><br/>Also, though Alex has a juvenile gang dress code, it is still, in a way, ""fancy"" looking, he wears bailey English derby hats, has a cane, and an interesting fake, sinister eyebrow. This is interesting in contrast to his parents, who have a very child-like dress code, despite Alex's baby uniform. His parents have dyed hair, and have a colorful home.<br/><br/>This goes hand in hand with the parallel between the milk and drugs laced in the milk that the gang likes to drink. Kubrick in some way is trying to illustrate a clash between generations, and a mix up between them that is causing some kind of trouble. These kinds of things are subjective to the viewer, but there seems to be a recurring pattern here that Kubrick is trying to express. <br/><br/>Another interesting parallel, and possibly the most important in terms to the entire film, is the duality between free will, and control. Alex is a ""free"" figure. His parents are pushovers and are completely oblivious to his lifestyle, making Alex a monster who is not controlled. He rapes, he batters, he robs, he kills, he does everything that the most despicable of people would do. But this of course changes after his treatment. The treatment sensitized Alex to violence and sex, and shows how the treatment destroys this man's life when he is trying to rebuild his life. <br/><br/>Before I make this review too long, I will go ahead and wrap it up. This is a must see film, despite its ""extreme intensity"" emotionally on its viewers. It's a true cinematic classic, and will be a perfect example, to me at least, of what true art should be."

","Young Alex DeLarge (Malcolm MacDowell) rapes, murders and listens to Beethoven. When his gang turns against him, he is caught by the police and sent to prison. From there, he undergoes a treatment to cure his violent urges. Will it work?<br/><br/>Casting: I think the cast was perfect, and this is Malcolm MacDowell's most recognizable role. Watching ""Clockwork Orange"" tends to lead to the debate of what's Kubrick's best film, as he has made so many classics. Many would say ""2001"", but this film puts up a good fight. But you really never hear people debate their favorite Malcolm film role, because it's invariably going to be this one, I think.<br/><br/>Imagery: Kubrick uses vibrant colors and some odd images. The milk bar is especially unusual, and sexual imagery appears all over in even the most ordinary of places. The cat house? A sign that says ""home""? Very unusual stuff. The strong Christ imagery? Intense. From my recollection of the book, it was never this extreme and we have Kubrick to thank for such a radical interpretation of futuristic England.<br/><br/>Music: Obviously, Beethoven's 9th plays a key role in this and it's worked in well. But also, the synthesized music fits (such as in the record store). I don't know if it makes you think of the future, but it certainly makes you think this is a very foreign place from the world we know today (yet, the lessons and morals here are just as important).<br/><br/>Some discussions could be attached to this film -- is it right to limit a man's choices, even if the choices eliminated are bad? In real life, is it okay to chemically castrate rapists rather than have them make their own choices? Is human nature defined by free choice, or are we predisposed? There is lots of room for discussion of these and other topics.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this, see it. I don't recall anyone ever leaving this film unchanged. It tends to be more easily accepted by men than women, for some reason, and I've been hesitant to recommend it to women. Some have said they ""don't get it"" and others can't get past the rape scene (which is disturbing, but serves to drive the point home). But then again, I had a female professor who had us read the book (I had already read it at that point). So, who knows. Really, this film is the very definition of morality, freedom and the nihilistic future we're heading towards."

I was expecting something a bit more along the lines of electro therapy, how watching violence could cure anyone I cant see, strong drugs may work more effectively.<br/><br/>By todays standard I found this movie tame.

","It's difficult to write something about Stanley Kubrick and about this film in general. Kubrick made only a small number of film in 46 years of career, but every picture is a masterpiece in its genre.<br/><br/>""A Clockwork Orange"" is not an exception. Based on the Anthony Burgess book, the film is a story about violence. In a future society Alex only loves violence and Beethoven music. The government arrest him and tries to cure him in planting in himself a disgusting feeling for violence... But this therapy has its limits.<br/><br/>The film is visually perfect, we can enjoy Kubrick's sarcasm and his taste for music -the score collects several pieces of different composers and different periods.<br/><br/>Everything works very well, and the film is still shocking 34 years later after its release -although at the time ""A Clockwork Orange"" was a huge scandal because it was one of the most violent films ever made, today its effect is partially diluted.<br/><br/>Just one thing -but it's a small detail, compared to the importance and the full achievement of the film. The film was made in 1970, two years after the release ""2001"". Although that, from a purely visual point of view, ""A Clockwork Orange"" looks older than the previous one.

","A visceral assault on the senses.<br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick is on top form with this film which sees Alex (The brilliantly cast Malcolm McDowell) a thugish teen, and his gang of droogs inflicting ultraviolence on their failing community.<br/><br/>But that's not as simple as this film gets.<br/><br/>The violence stops when Alex is apprehended for murder, after being double-crossed by his droogs who have gotten tired of him.<br/><br/>He's chucked in the clink, and after a couple of years a revolutionary new technique is introduced that helps get rid of criminal attitudes. To us it would be called aversion therapy.<br/><br/>After this, Alex is totally reformed of his criminality (or so it seems), yet he is also released to his former home, and on his return, he is cast out by his parents, and is beaten up by his former droogs, who ironically are now police officers.<br/><br/>He makes his way to an isolated house. A house of which before he had visited with his droogs, and had left the old writer crippled, and his wife dead after viciously raping her.<br/><br/>At first, he isn't recognised. But as he begins to re-sing ""Singing in the Rain."" Of which he heartedly sang the night of the previous attack, the man in the wheelchair remembers, and tries to bring around Alex's death.<br/><br/>But, Alex after attempting to commit suicide, only ends up injured.<br/><br/>In hospital, the papers advocate for poor Alex, who has been wronged, and the prime minister visits to lay his final plan to let Alex back into society as a respected individual.<br/><br/>Yet, the last image will go to prove, that maybe, the person we are naturally always lurks beneath, as Alex's thought of sexual delight comes back - so surely will the rest of his evil desires...<br/><br/>--- From that, you may think this film is deep, and quite repulsive to watch, but really it is quite amazing. Packed with themes, from the debate between free will and obedience, societal struggles and abuse of power it is a great picture. Well acted, well directed, and well written. A classic by all accounts.<br/><br/>Previously it was even banned in the UK, and I urge you, be careful when you watch it. It is not for the faint hearted - especially religious people.<br/><br/>9/10"

"rowanmaillot","10","1","2","21 January 2020"," ""A Real Horrorshow""
","The greatest movie by the greatest director. Seriously, every shot in this movie is beautiful, sometimes the disturbing scenes are even laughable. Like the fight between Billy Boy's droogs and Alex's droogs is violent but almost comical, the Singing in the Rain scene is disturbing but playful because of the way Alex dances, he treats it like it's just his everyday job (which it is.) When this movie came out it was way ahead of its time, but it was only preparing us for what would happen in the years to come. This is not only a great Crime, Drama Satire, it is also the greatest futuristic/science fiction horror psychological thriller, this film is every genre all masterfully put together by Kubrick (the greatest director.) If there was no Clockwork Orange there would be no Natural Born Killers, Trainspotting, Fight Club, none of these movies would exist without Kubrick which makes him the master of all (and I mean ALL) films.<br/><br/>Kubrick's movie starts with Alex sipping from a glass of Moloko Plus which has three key ingredients (drugs) vellocet, synthomesc and drencrom, which would sharpen you up and make you ready for a bit of the old ultra-violence. Not only is this one of the most horrifying, bone trembling, scariest, well acted, greatest scenes in cinematic history, the cinematography is beautiful and the closest you could come to hearing the most perfect dialogue ever spoken by a non-famous actor. When this came out it pushed the boundaries on what could be seen and what could not be seen on a screen, back then movies were harmless things to watch if you wanted to have fun or a good ride, but this film took movies to a whole new level. Sure there were films before it like: Who's That Knocking at my Door?, Psycho and Marnie which had subtle hints of nudity, sex and violence, but this was the first one that was THIS controversial, and since that date of January 13th 1972 no film has been as controversial.<br/><br/>People were blaming this movie for inspiring them to sing, 'Singing in the Rain' while raping and beating a couple, people were caught wearing white clothing with bowler hats and black boots while beating up elderly people and blaming on the movie saying that 'Clockwork Orange' made them do it. Despite its initial controversy, critics seemed to love it. It was nominated for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Editing, so, pretty well received. I will add more to this review in the future since I believe this movie has a lot to talk about and lots of background history. Even though this film isn't considered a horror film, it is scary to say the least, at times it feels overwhelming, but covers all that up with its great satire, at times too dark for younger audiences, but myself, a 13 year old, understood the comedy and humour and enjoyed it.<br/><br/>Needless to say, this film was snubbed at the oscars. Malcolm McDowell should've won best actor and Kubrick DEFINITELY should've won Best Screenplay, Best Picture and Best Director, it truly was Oscar-worthy, but I guess X- rated movies never win at the Academy. This is my favourite movie of all time!"

","This film is horrible not because of graphic violence, but because of the way the characters behave and talk to each other. There are a lot of different ways to analyse this movie and everyone will have a different interpretation, but it certainly won't let you indifferent."
"pluem_chaisiri","10","1","2","28 October 2019"," Evil in its finest form
","This is probably one of the best film I've watch. Despite being made for almost half a century ago, it still tops many of the films made today. I love the way this film was directed, the tone of the film, the narrative of it, the characters, and the meaning behind the story.<br/><br/>I believe nobody could argue that the protagonist, Alex, is the greatest villain of all time. He is pure evil and absolutely detestable. He is the embodiment of every terrible things in this society. Still, I found myself strangely smypathizing with him in many situations. Malcolm McDowell is absolutely fantastic in his role as Alex.<br/><br/>The film itself is brutal and disturbing. I can understand how and why some people can't make it to the ending. Moreover, there is no good characters in this film, and there's no one I'd like to root for. Everyone is all acting in their self-interest, doing what best for themselves.<br/><br/>This film can be interpret in numerous ways depending on the viewers. In my opinion, the film is trying to represent the real nature of the society we're living in and the unpleasant reality of this world. The violence is real and most of it exists because of human, however, we often choose to ignore it to our own convenience. In this case, what should the society choose, freedom or safety?<br/><br/>Finally, this film is probably not to everyone's taste, but I believe it deserves to be on the list of iconic films. It touches on the topic that few are dared to discuss. And although, it seems surreal, I believe it's actually not that far off from reality."

"nikxatz","9","1","2","2 August 2019"," Viddy well, Stanley Kubrick. Viddy well.
","A Clockwork Orange is a haunting and powerful fable told by the unique and foreshadowing eyes of a true creator, Stalney Kubrick.The whole movie feels so exotic and out of this world. The colours, the weird sets and the shiny furnitures, they all create a sense of alienation, but the irony is that this story is really realistic and grounded.<br/><br/>We perceive the film through the view of Alex, the protagonist. Alex is a troubled anti-hero. He has fun with the pain of others and is commited to sex and ultra-violence, but soon he falls into a neverending black hole and he faces the true evil of the movie-the ones who want to turn him into something he cannot be.<br/><br/>Alex is used as a tool to an experiment which turns scoundrels like him into noble men.We have sen that Alex loves his criminal life and nature, he cannot live without it and when they force him to change and pretend to be a good man, he naturally cannot. And they treat him in the worst way possible. He is like a thing to experiment on and he is spit on and I felt that really nobody eserves such a life, even Alex.<br/><br/>The real monters and sinners are the goverment and the men who do these experiments. Kubrick also questions what is considered noble and what not. Alex and his gang go in the same infamous bar with famous singers, the officer inspecting Alex reveals an animalisitc expression when he sees a naked woman, some of the characters just treat Alex with a barbaric way.<br/><br/>It is a really thought-provoking film, but the filmmakin aspect-oh lord. The use of music is sensational. Vivaldi and Bethoven are instanlty mxed with horrific, brutal images and the result is fun and memorable. The colours are also fresh and the clothes, the way the rooms are lighted and decorazed gives th film another feel -one of being at a far-away world, but the simularities with ours are so obvious. The different and crazy vocabulary is so fun to listen to. The way the camera moves when the characers walk to halls, the closeups to the Jesus' schalptures, the fast-forward in the sex scene, the slow motion, hte subtle pull back in the first scene... I can go on an on.<br/><br/>""It's not fair! It's not fair that I should feel sick when I hear lovely, lovely Ludwig Van!""<br/><br/>Not fair indeed<br/><br/>Unforgettable film"
"BassLightyear","9","1","2","8 June 2019"," A brief analysis from two different perspectives.
","This is the only film I've ever watched back to back. After watching it the first time all I knew was that I loved it. I knew I loved the way the characters expressed themselves, the cinematography, the artful display of everything infront of the camera; it was as if Kubrick was painting a picture with every shot... But to go deeper than that, I had to rewatch it right away.<br/><br/>I kind of anticipated the ending but still wasn't ready for it. I knew it made sense, but I couldn't really understand it. It wasn't until I watched the film for the third time, a bit later on, that I managed to uncover a couple of the films' major truths.<br/><br/>I will now talk very shortly about those truths.<br/><br/>First of all, the film carries a very strong political satirical message: The same minister of the same government is using our protagonist, Alex, at two different times, in two drastically different and radically opposing and paradoxical ways. But still manages to strengthen his position as a politician and his government's position as a ruler of society in both cases. So I guess the film shows that politicians in a government, or the political system overall, are capable of manipulating events, circumstances and the people affected by such for their own political and personal gain. The care for the people only goes as far as to how useful they can be to ""the cause"".<br/><br/>The second, and more profound truth in my opinion, is an ethical one, which resonates deep within the moral quarries of the human mind. You see, Alex served his sentence, endured his punishment and was cured. Everything the society asked for, right? But still, his family was against him, everybody he had wronged wanted to punish him and even his old friends (or droogs), who already punished him by the way, by betraying him and turning him in to the police, felt the need to punish him even further. So my question is - what did he go to prison for? What was the point of society sending him to prison to be punished only to continue the punishment after he got out? And what's the point of being cured if everybody treats you as if you were not? As if you were the same person as you were before? You could say that society re-shaped the new Alex back into his old self by treating him the way they did; they brought that upon themselves. But when you think about it, Alex was still the same person after his treatment as he was before the treatment - he had the same impulses and desires as he did before, the only difference now was that he was physically unable to act on them. The treatment had trapped him and made him a slave to it; that became his decease; hence (when he at last could indulge in his desires again) ""I was cured, all right""."

It is amazing how they get you to feel bad for him at then end after all the despicable stuff he does in the beginning. The music is some of the best to be put on screen. The shots Kubrick sets in that film are actually chilling. It a very though provoking movie and is likely to have you thinking about this movie for weeks after you watch it."

","This is simply the best of Kubrick.<br/><br/>The main protagonist, Alex DeLarge (awesomely played of Malcolm McDowell), is a spiritual entity moving towards Darkness (violence, no regrets for wrong doings, cruelty and control of the gang members). <br/><br/>At the certain point, Alex becomes extremely dangerous and an uptight society is pushed to isolate him by the sending the young man to prison. A copy of the New Testament, which was giving to Alex to become a better person, attracts him only from a Dark character point of view - there is no compassion for Jesus, but an enjoyment of the cruelty of a Roman solder beating Jesus. <br/><br/>Prison is not the best place for Alex and he takes advantage of a chance offered from the government to get out of prison – to go through a experiment. A priest is pitching an idea of giving Alex his own (Spiritual) choice (towards Light), as a true cure for the young man (and society), but nobody is interested in it. (as a matter of fact, the ""no-choice"" is a feature of Darks). After the cure, Alex gets his freedom, but negative karma for all his bad doings is acting against him and demanding pay back so he suffers. The ending of the movie provides a new twist of survival for the protagonist. Alex is getting help from a representative of highest society, who is offering him a mutually beneficial deal. <br/><br/>The evolution of Alex towards Darkness continues on a new level.<br/><br/>Excellent movie."
"chriistianadank","8","1","2","14 November 2016"," Me and my Droogies

With the Ludovico method he gets brainwashed and can no longer touch women or fight. I think this film is more than just about the fun. It's about the human being and how it lives and at the end of the film you will have this question: is it right to brainwash a man who just follows his sins and just is a human?

"brianberta","10","1","2","11 November 2016"," A smart film which explores the nature of free will and the relationship between man and the government
","Kubrick is my favorite director of all time. He has produced so many masterpieces, and so many of his films are seen as magnum opuses of their respective genres. It's also hard to pick his best film as I like most of his films more as I continue to re-watch them. I put off watching ""A Clockwork Orange"" for quite a long time. I knew about the violent/sexually explicit content in it. I wanted to make sure that I was desensitized before watching it. I didn't want to miss out on something spectacular due to it being too much for me to handle. When I did watch it, however, it only took 5 minutes for me to get engaged into the film.<br/><br/>In future Britain, a violent gang leader named Alex DeLarge is betrayed by his gang, captured by the police, and put in prison. While there, he volunteers for an experimental aversion therapy created by the government in hopes of becoming non-violent so he can be released back into society.<br/><br/>Alex's parents seem to be completely clueless to the dystopian state of the world. Strangely, Alex has a fond love of classical music, especially Beethoven's 9th Symphony. Classical music is often played over scenes of violence, sex, and rape. In the opening scene at the milk bar, sexual imagery is present throughout it. This imagery is also found in many more scenes in the film. Those scenes display how most men are led around by their sexual desires, and contribute nothing to society. Liberal activists and therapists try to make Alex a productive member of society, and they try to get him to be non-violent. However, what's important to the film is that he doesn't change by the end.<br/><br/>Character arcs are meant to show how a particular character changes over the events of the movie. However, character arcs can also work even if the character winds up back at the beginning. The reason Alex DeLarge's character arc works so well is partly because of the fact that the viewer doesn't expect that it will happen. His resolution comes as a complete surprise. Another reason why it works is because it approaches character arcs in a different way. Its uniqueness helps it stand out from other films with memorable character arcs. It gives the viewer another reason to enjoy the film.<br/><br/>In the first third of the film, the viewer quickly grows to hate Alex. He seems to have no redeeming qualities to him. He beats and rapes numerous people throughout the film. However, in the final third, we feel sorry for Alex as he continuously gets beaten by people he hurt in the first third. The reason the viewer feels sympathy for him is because he has no free will. The government has effected him in a way which made him unable to defend himself. Despite everything we saw him do, we feel sorry for him since he is turned into a test monkey. The treatment quickly feels like torture. When the government tries to get him to mend their reputation to the public, it comes off like he's getting forced into doing it. The final scene has a somewhat positive effect on the viewer, as they know that the side effects the government caused Alex to experience will no longer effect him. This serves as the light at the end of the tunnel.<br/><br/>The visuals in the film are also pretty good. Kubrick makes full use of the wide angle lens. This is used on objects which are relatively close to the camera. Objects on the edges of shots tend to curve upwards. This allows us to view the world in a bizarre way, sort of like how Alex views it. These shots also allow us to get a clear view of the environment that the movie takes place in (this is sort of like the purpose of the long takes in ""Children of Men""). Also, it's hard to forget the first shot of the film. The angle of the first shot makes Alex look menacing. The camera angle is positioned slightly above his head. This makes him look up at the viewer.<br/><br/>However, this only applies for camera techniques. The movie also has stunning cinematography. The settings look particularly intriguing. The phallic imagery gives the world a haunting feeling. The apartment block that Alex lives in looks rundown and poorly managed. It lets the viewer know that the environment has deteriorated overtime. There are a lot of scenes which look intricately designed. Although ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is still Kubrick's most visually impressive film, this one doesn't fall too far behind it, and it remains as a strong contender for that position.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this movie is another one of Kubrick's many masterpieces. Behind all of the explicit scenes in it, it is a smart film. It explores the nature of free will and the relationship between man and the government. The character arc that Alex goes through is unique and enthralling. The movie also makes us become attached to Alex's character. On top of that, the film has outstanding visuals and camera-work. Finally, who can forget the iconic and haunting score which plays at the beginning? It sounds ominous, and it adds to the bizarre tone of the film. This is not an easy movie to watch as many people will find it hard to sit through. However, it's a must-see film. It just requires you to be desensitized to movie violence quite a bit."
"eroscow-05581","9","1","2","26 October 2016"," Bizarre, terrifying, and funny.
","Alex in this movie, as many have said in previous reviews, is the embodiment of what we fear as humans. He has no remorse and is a violent sexual deviant. Although as the movie progresses it all comes back on him and ends up hurting him.<br/><br/>When Alex gets released from the sick and inhumane way of curing his delinquency he is made to have negative associations with all forms of violence and sexual desire making him unable to act on any thoughts of such things. After this treatment and being released into the public all his former actions come back to bite him. The hobo that he beats gets a swarm of hobos to beat him. When the police come and shoo the hobos away Alex realizes the police he's looking at are the same boys he domineered and abused before his treatment. Furthermore, he ends up so beaten and frightened he begs to stay in the house of some old man who tries to kill him by playing Beethoven's 9th Symphony while Alex is locked upstairs, which Alex admitted listening to makes him not want to live anymore.<br/><br/>This says a lot about free will and becoming better on your own terms instead of using forced bad-association treatment. Alex throughout the whole time, post-treatment, is unable to defend himself and therefore almost dies after he jumps out of the window of the old man's house. This leads to the government apologizing to him, while he's in the hospital with multiple broken bones, as a PR response.<br/><br/>On the humor front there is a lot of dark humor such as the woman being attacked and killed with her beloved weighted sculpture of a white penis. Another example is the ending scene where Alex is being fed by the prime-minister.<br/><br/>Overall, I'd recommend this film to anyone looking for something out of the ordinary and uniquely interesting."
"MissSimonetta","10","1","2","26 March 2016"," We are all victims of the modern age
","I have seen A Clockwork Orange almost twenty times and every time it remains astonishing viewing. Though there have been gorier films with more surface-level shocks, ACO is still a provocative film almost fifty years onward. It is still capable of actually making people angry about its violence and its ambivalence toward human nature. Some people still find it sickening; I cannot say I blame them. The gang rape scene alone is still scary (I had nightmares about it after first seeing the movie), even if you never see any penetration. It's isn't scary because it's graphic-- it's the gleeful, unwarranted cruelty of Alex Delarge which is unnerving, how the thought of tormenting innocents is enough to send him singing and dancing in-between kicks to an old man's chest. Even more unnerving are the character's charm and humor which render him likable despite his savagery and sadism.<br/><br/>I think that's what is most disturbing about Clockwork-- not the violence, but the controversial statements on the duality of mankind. A rapist/murderer can be pitiable once he's rendered less than human by a government as power-hungry as he. A tenderhearted journalist can become a bloodthirsty monster who goes against his own ideals when faced with the man who violated his poor wife or when faced with an indifferent public he must ""push"" into freedom by any means necessary! The world of A Clockwork Orange only seems like an outlandish future nightmare on the surface with the kitschy 70s fashions and the surreal angles with which Kubrick films his English locations. Really, once you examine it closely enough-- the struggle between being safe but controlled by the state or free but vulnerable to the evil of unbridled individualism of people like Alex and his droogs-- you realize this movie from 1971 remains frighteningly relevant in the 21st century."

","A Clockwork Orange (1971): Dir: Stanley Kubrick / Cast: Malcolm McDowell, Patric Magee, Anthony Sharp, Aubrey Morris, Adrienne Corri: Intriguing futuristic vision regarding sin and our nature towards it. It asks viewers to let down their accusations until the flip side is revealed. It introduces Alex and his three druids on a typical night of beatings, gang wars and rape before relaxing with Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. Betrayed by his druids after a burglary turned murder, he is sentenced to fourteen years in prison until chosen for an experiment to cure sin. Controversial and extremely disturbing but not without rhyme or reason. It will either offend the squeamish or insight the intellect. Stylishly directed by Stanley Kubrick with lavish music and exquisite art direction. A remarkable accomplishment after having directed Dr. Strangelove and 2001: A Space Odyssey. Malcolm McDowell delivers a poetic performance as Alex with strong supporting work by Patric Magee as Mr. Alexander, a writer victimized and will seek revenge after his wife's death. She is played by Adrienne Corri whose humiliating vulnerability made her a great trooper during filming. Anthony Sharp plays a political figure and founder of the cure. Aubrey Morris steals scenes as Mr. Deltoid, Alex's parole officer. Compelling demonstration of sin, its maddening consequences, and the failure to confront it. Score: 9 / 10"

","Having read Anthony Burgess's original novel before seeing this, I must say that Stanley Kubrick, one of my personal favorite directors, had done a great job adapting it. When the book fell short in detail, Kubrick took the opportunity to portray the world of Alex the Large with stunning sets filled with sexual imagery and disturbing surrealism. While there is no real concrete reason for this, it helps create the bizarre atmosphere of ""A Clockwork Orange"". All of Kubrick's original touches (""Siiiiingin' in the rain!"") add to the story rather than take away from it, though Burgess would never admit it. ""Clockwork Orange"" is one of the most visually striking films of all time. The camera angles are distorted and uncomfortable, with iconic shots such as Alex's smug stare into the camera from beneath his eyebrows, and the phallic nose of his mask sticking out into the line of sight of his most unfortunate victim. Also triumphant is the soundtrack, which combines synthesized droning (especially ""The Funeral of Queen Mary"", one of my favorite movie themes) with the works of Beethoven so beloved by Alex. On a visual and aural level, this film is a masterpiece.<br/><br/>However, there are several problems with this film, which I must address. I could never get behind the actual story. For those who don't know, the original novel had a final chapter, an epilogue of sorts, which basically shows Alex giving up crime and becoming not only a hardworking citizen of the community, but a father. Burgess wanted to include this to give the novel a ""happy ending"" and tie it together with what he considered the book's ultimate theme: redemption. However, it was scrapped by American editors since they wanted a darker ending, and Kubrick went with it. For me, both of these endings are terrible. I will explain why.<br/><br/>Burgess's ending, while technically redeeming Alex, fails to make him sympathetic at all. Alex never regrets his actions of ""ultra- violence"", he simply decides that he's tired of it one day and that's the end of that. It is almost to suggest that assault, gang wars, and rape are just a part of growing up that every teenager goes through and should always be forgiven. In a way, this ""happy ending"" gives a horrifying lesson. With Kubrick's ending, Alex is magically cured of his conditioning through ""sleep learning"", and he simply goes back to committing crimes. What's the problem with this? While I don't mind a dark and grim ending, I dislike this ending because it's almost like the story never happened. When all is said and done, no character learns anything, the setting never really changes, and it is exactly like the beginning. I believe that violates the most basic tenets of storytelling. If a story is attempting to get a message across, at least make the main character change in some way. I know Kubrick couldn't resist giving a cynical ending, but that's just bad storytelling.<br/><br/>In my opinion, a much better ending would have been to cut to credits the moment after Alex attempted suicide. If Alex was driven to madness by his conditioning and killed himself, this would serve not only as retribution for all his terrible actions, but would give the slightest chance for the audience to pity him. I don't know what Burgess or Kubrick were going for, but I never once, while watching, thought ""Alex doesn't deserve this."" I felt bad, sure, out of instinctual fear of domination, pain, and humiliation. But what he goes through is a slap on the wrist when compared to the atrocities he himself has committed. I don't buy the ridiculous claim that Mr. Alexander ""stooped down to Alex's level"" by driving him insane; he was getting long-awaited revenge on the guy who brutally raped his wife and indirectly caused her death. And again, from a storytelling perspective, a death is a much more powerful ending, and may have actually driven home the whole message about redemption and free will, rather than having Alex smugly return to society with barely a scratch on his body or psyche.<br/><br/>I give this film 8 out of 10 stars purely for the fantastic work that went into the creation of this movie. The film's graphic ""ultra-violence"" and ""the old in-out-in-out"", which most people have very strong opinions on, is neither loved nor hated by me. I don't see it as pure exploitation, but it isn't for artistic purposes either; it is the harsh, nightmarish visuals needed to punctuate the story. In some cases, it is actually toned down from the book (Alex molests two underage girls and is later raped by his friends). Alex himself, for all my problems with his development, is a very cunning love-to-hate-him villain protagonist, portrayed brilliantly by Malcolm McDowell. While I think the film has some other problems, like its oh-so-deep message on free will (I think it's a pile of cal), it is aesthetically one of my favorites of all time. My problems don't exactly ruin the film for me, and if I don't think too hard about the story, I see it as a work of pure art. ""A Clockwork Orange"" is very good in its own right, but it's one interesting lesson short of perfect. So that's the gist of my slovos on this sinny! High time to go out and filly with the droogs, and sod with the ptitsas real horrorshow!"
"hjbuhrkall","7","1","2","9 August 2015"," Disturbingly good, but a bit ""overplayed""
","When watching this movie, and comparing it to some of his other work, I have no doubts that this is the work of Stanley Kubrick. And in this movie (like in some of his later work), Kubrick gives us a quick glance into the twisted minds of the psychopaths he depicts.<br/><br/>As we follow Alex through all his bad deeds, be they rape, murder, or just the beating of an old man for the fun of it. It gets increasingly more difficult for me to feel anything else for him than a combination of fear and loath. He is shown as an extreme sadist with a deeply worrying lack of empathy, e.g. when he carries on in raping a woman while smiling and singing still.<br/><br/>I have read several reviews here on IMDb saying that they hate Alex at first, but later on they feel sorry for him. But I'm sad to say, that no amount of bible studies, mistreatment from the government, or beatings by the police, is ever going to make me feel sorry for him - Period!<br/><br/>A decent story (a bit disturbing perhaps), Production is fair for an '71 movie.<br/><br/>Sometimes though, it feels like some of the roles are ""overplayed"" (especially Alex, Dim & the Chief Guard Barnes)."

This movie was rated X but believe me, there is not much of such content. May be it has become a common thing nowadays so I am not feeling for the time it was made. But I would give maximum credits to direction, the scenes were so well directed so you can call it more of a film noir. It is not the typical drama it is presented in a very picturesque manner. Stanley Kubrick with all his Trade mark shots makes you realize he was one of the finest directors. I forgot the music is really used beautifully and gives an edge to the film. I was bored in many parts of the movie but considering the time it was made it is really very commendable."

I know some people doesn't like this movie because of its violence but it doesn't really bother me. The main problem with this film is it's screenplay especially the last act which is very lazy screen writing in my opinion. Though the film does have a good theme: free will and psychological conditioning of human mind lack of better screenplay ruins the movie from achieving greatness. On the positive side lead actor Malcolm McDowell has done a great job. The film does have really interesting background music which i liked.

"raulfaust","6","1","2","28 October 2012"," What?
","After seeing three Krubick's movies, one thing I can tell for sure: they're full of unnecessary/meaningless scenes. For instance, what is the intend of that scene where Alex lies in bed and talks to a guy (his brother maybe) with underwear only. What's the point? Actually, most scenes are random and made only to show director's skills-- oh, I found a point for that scenes! I can surely eulogize the good directing of this picture; even thought some scenes aren't important, director make them in a fabulous way that entertains the spectator. I don't know which is better, the colors and scenario or background sound-- all are great. The question involving prison and human re-education is very creative, even more if you imagine it's been thought more than forty years ago. Also, most of the cast is very professional, of course praising Malcolm McDowell's extremely well done job-- I actually can't look at him normally anymore. The same thing that happened with Jack Nicholson thirty two years ago. All in all, it's an indeed good movie, but I unfortunately felt something was missing. If you're looking for gratuitous violence with less length and better writing, see ""Funny Games""-- either versions are great."
"Andy-296","8","1","2","16 September 2012"," Landmark even if not perfect film
","Justly regarded as a landmark film, this disturbing and violent movie by Stanley Kubrick – stunningly filmed and still shocking after forty years - has been so talked about and over analyzed that there is probably not much more to say. But let me add a few thoughts about A Clockwork Orange, after having recently seen it again after perhaps some twenty years.<br/><br/>First, the movie has three clear and differentiated acts. In the first act, we see Alex and his gang commit outrageous acts of violence, rape and eventually murder against helpless citizens in a futuristic London. In the second act, Alex is caught and sent to prison, where he is ""cured"" through an aversion method called the Ludovico technique (involving basically the infliction of pain and nausea on Alex when he is forced to see violent acts in a movie). The third act sees Alex being released back into society, supposedly cured, but he will find it impossible to reintegrate himself to society. If the first act is a clear masterpiece (perhaps the best thing that Kubrick ever made), and the second act is very powerful, the third act I found wanting. It's as if Kubrick (or for that matter, author Anthony Burgess) wasn't very sure about how to wrap the story or what particular message he wanted to give forward.<br/><br/>Lastly, and about the message of the film, there has been some debate on whether this is a right wing (conservative) film or is it a left wing (liberal) film. My feeling is that it cannot be put safely in any of the two categories. Kubrick was too idiosyncratic a director to be put into a neat ideological label. Thus, while the movie's radical critique of contemporary western society might put it in the left category, its skepticism that criminals can be ""cured"", can be seen as a conservative position. Also conservative might be its skepticism about whether any government bureaucracy can have good intentions toward the people."
"bayou_hannibal","7","1","2","31 July 2012"," Good movie -- as a result of the brilliant source material
","The first time that I watched A Clockwork Orange as an adult old enough to understand it, I really loved it. Then I read the book, and I loved the movie a little bit less. It is a great movie when it follows the source material, but the Kubrick-i-zation of A Clockwork Orange makes it merely good. This is because Kubrick adds all kinds of ridiculous style to the movie, as well as the occasional bad joke. It's worth a watch, and the humor mostly works. However, it's not the masterpiece that Kubrick's thralls insist it is.<br/><br/>A Clockwork Orange covers a lot of themes. Mostly, it deals with modern society's utter ineptitude when it comes to managing and eliminating violent crime. Society tries brutal punishment while psychoanalyzing psychopaths. Nothing seems to work. Both of these extremes are shown in a darkly humorous manner in A Clockwork Orange. Although it is a ""comedy"", there isn't any point in A Clockwork Orange that is laugh-out-loud funny. The humor comes from the absurdity of it all. A Clockwork Orange has the same sense of humor as Dr. Strangelove -- portraying everyone as either evil, dogmatic, or stupid, interested only in themselves, and not humanity as a whole. The politicians and cops in A Clockwork Orange don't care about finding real solutions that make society better. They care only about applying band-aids, and phony solutions that look good. Like Dr. Strangelove, the story feels like a great big sick joke, but with a strong message behind it.<br/><br/>Malcolm McDowell does give a great performance as Alex, the ""humble narrator"". Alex is a total sociopath, and he narrates the violent events of the story with a stoic indifference. When the violent tables get turned on him in the movie, McDowell perfectly plays the phony victim that Alex becomes. The one problem that I have with McDowell though is that he is too old for the part, but perhaps that was inevitable since a more faithful portrayal would have been too disturbing for the studio. Unfortunately, McDowell gives the only real good performance in this movie.<br/><br/>My biggest problem with this movie is with some of the absurdities that Kubrick introduced. For starters, the style throughout the movie is absolutely ludicrous. Old sci-fi movies about ""the future"" are notorious for having a bad sense of fashion, but this movie really takes the cake. In A Clockwork Orange, ""the future"" looks like somebody's gaudiest '70s nightmare taken to an extreme. Interiors of houses are full of blindingly bright colors and crazy artwork. Every other woman has brightly colored hair. Alex and his droogs wear tight white clothing with derby hats. Maybe in the early '70s this looked edgy. Now, it looks stupid.<br/><br/>Another problem with the movie is that it was just too far ahead of its time. It isn't Kubrick's fault -- it is just the reality of making a movie based on an incredibly violent and sexual book. Even now, in 2012, the public would have a hard time accepting a perfectly faithful translation of Anthony Burgess's masterpiece. But because of this, a lot of the content falls flat. For instance, a scene in the book where Alex rapes a couple of young girls becomes a scene in the movie where Alex has consensual sex with a couple of women. The book scene illustrates what a horrible monster Alex is. The movie scene is just pointless soft core porn. (No I don't think that the movie should have portrayed that scene faithfully -- it should have just been left out). I am probably one of the few people on Earth who thinks that the movie isn't disturbing enough and, the violence, not visceral enough. If you think that I am crazy, watch the Goodfellas scene where Joe Pesci stabs the guy in the trunk of the car. In the 40 years since ACO was made, it is startling how much more realistic movie violence has become.<br/><br/>I still own the movie, and this is one that I can definitely recommend. To me, the book is a 10, and the movie translation is a 7. Given how horrible the majority of book-to-movie translations are, I'd consider that a win. With that said, I think that this movie, more than any other, would benefit tremendously from a remake."
"neil-476","9","1","2","10 July 2011"," Difficult to divorce the message from the medium
","I saw A Clockwork Orange when it first came out, having read the book (not any easy read, incidentally - the droog slang is easier to listen to than to read: the whole book is narrated by Alex). I enjoyed the film (superficially) then it disappeared because Kubrick withdrew it due to the copycat factor.<br/><br/>On encountering it again after Kubrick's death I could understand much more easily that the thematic centre of the movie is the morality of depriving someone of choice - what is worse? The evil that someone does, or the evil of depriving them of the ability to choose whether or not to commit evil acts? Kubrick slyly uses a variety of means to make Alex a character we can like and identify with despite the dreadful acts he commits. And then the conditioning process - and the acts perpetrated on him after his release - make us sympathise with him. This is necessary in order for us to understand the theme of the film. Yet it is also the major factor responsible for real world copycat crime based on this movie.<br/><br/>This, of course, is an unsolvable dilemma.<br/><br/>Personally, I am all for taking away the choice of those who commit such acts."
"Stanley-Becker","Null","1","2","10 June 2011"," Rites of Passage {Stanley Kubrick}
","In the early 60's, when Burgess wrote the novel, one of the controversies in the realm of psychology was the popularity among academics of the Behaviourist approach of B. F. Skinner. Skinner had evolved his scientific approach directly from Pavlov and his demonstration of how dogs could be made to repeat responses to stimuli in a predictable manner {""classical conditioning""}. Skinner developed this theory applying it to human behaviour as ""conditioned response"". Skinner was so confident that his approach was the way of the future that he wrote an utopian novel called ""Walden 2"", as a riposte to Thoureau's transcendalist novel, {""Walden""}, of a life of bucolic fulfillment. In Skinner's novel society would be in the morally superior hands of apparatchiks that he termed ""planner-managers"" Behaviour would thus be regulated by the state by the use of conditioning technique. Anthony Burgess was obviously well aware of the threat to human freedom that Psychiatry and psychology posed and set out to write a novel where the absurdities of control obsession/mania would be exposed.<br/><br/>Kubrick made a highly coloured rendition of the life of the young miscreant Alex, {magnetically portrayed by Malcolm McDowell} and his band of teenage rebels who dress in a group fashion, speak in a personal argot, get juiced on drug-laden milk and whisky, steal cars, use weapons and engage in anti-social behaviour which includes rape, burglary, and grievous bodily harm. In Burgess's fictional world , you have here a supreme character for behavioral modification.<br/><br/>Alex is eventually betrayed by his comrades-in-arms and is convicted for murder and enters the State Prison for a period of nine years. There, because of the overcrowding, and the need to make space for the more threatening category of ""political prisoner"" - Alex is offered the satirical option of a 14 day quick non-surgical lobotomy, termed ""aversion therapy"". It is important, at this point, to point out the one unexpected anomaly of this young rebel, Alex. Although Alex is revealed to have no respect for pedantry and culture {in the novel he destroys books with the utmost contempt}, in any shape or form, he has an abiding worship and love for the abstractions of classical music {a form of higher culture}, This characteristic is something he shares with his creator, Anthony Burgess and also the auteur, Stanley Kubrick. Why it is plausible, that such a rabid prole and anti-elitist as Alex surely is, - would be disarmed by the abstract formulations and precious classism of Ludwig von Beethoven, {while also displaying a total disdain for popular music}, is one of those mysterious elements of good fiction and good cinema. Alex, then becomes a pawn in the political game of the ""politics of the Future"" eventually pronouncing himself ""cured"" and according to the film {though not according to the original novel}, ready to continue with a life of mayhem and ultra-violence.<br/><br/>That this movie tells a yarn which is both entertaining and challenging, is without question, the result of a collaboration of a great writer and a great movie maker. It is rare to see a novel so precisely realized as this screen adaptation. Voila!!"
"dj_hottie-910-458400","10","1","2","6 June 2011"," Rape, Ultraviolence and Beethoven- THE ULTIMATE SATIRE
","What can I say about A Clockwork Orange that hasn't already been said? How can I convey the magnitude of its brilliance in words? I'll try, best as I can to paint a clear picture of this masterpiece. And what can I say about Stanley Kubrick- the man was god! I've seen all of his films, but this one is my very favourite. This is his magnum opus.<br/><br/>It starts off with dear Alex and his droogs sitting in the Korova milk bar sipping away and preparing themselves for what they call 'the old ultraviolence,' which we'll soon see is rape and a severe beating to a particular old writer. From then on, from these events there unfolds a tapestry of chaos, weirdness and disaster. But Malcolm McDowell is just a delight. While all of this horror and oddity occurred, I never found myself blaming him. He makes Alex seem so charismatic that it's amazing.<br/><br/>What the hell is ACO about? A guy called Alex living in the distant future, a bizarre colorful kaleidescope of stylized clothing and living spaces and odd people in a Kafkaesque (yep, i just had to use that word) nightmare. He commits a nasty, insane (and somewhat funny) crime and does time for it. And he bumps into a few of his old...acquaintances later on, and the law attempts to cure his delinquency...in a rather disturbing way.<br/><br/>The cherry on top is the excellent soundtrack. The weird Moog synthesizer just adds to the strange atmosphere. And the way Kubrick artfully uses classical music, like Beethoven's 9th and Rossini's Barber of Seville overture and Thieving Magpie and William Tell Overture is simply a marvel. It's a pleasure to listen to such lovely music while watching such vivid imagery.<br/><br/>Anyways, that can't even begin to describe the film but all you can do is see it for yourself. I watched this as a wide eyed 14 year old and I was just bewildered by the whole damn thing, but I loved it. What's not to love? Call me crazy, but I've always though that the 'violence' in this film was over-hyped. People tend to make a mountain out of a molehill. ACO was not meant to be a goddamn tragedy, it's a biting satire that's darkly humorous and prodigal in it's predictions. It's pretty funny, when it all comes down to it, the irony, the black humor, the sharp wit of Anthony Burgess and Stanley Kubrick, the inane charm of Malcolm McDowell, the ridiculousness of it all.<br/><br/>And then there's people who complain that ACO promotes violence and perversion. Reallyy?? Is that so? I guess those people were jerking off for the whole time and not even paying attention. If that's what you got out of it, then you must be brain dead. The ending is unrepentant though, that's why I love it. As Alex grins and says ""I was cured, alright"" you realize the 'method' in which society 'cured' him.<br/><br/>All in all, for the open minded (the religious zealots oughta stay away) art lovers, A Clockwork Orange is a treat. Not only is it my favourite film, but one of the greatest films ever made. Come and get one in the yarbles...that is, if ya got any yarbles!"

","The reasons behind the troubled release of Stanley Kubrick's jet black comedy satire have been misread over the years (I would go so far as to say deliberately mis-written by the tabloid press) meaning that when the film finally received a posthumous UK release it was assumed that the film was previously 'banned' on the basis of copycat incidents. In fact, Kubrick himself demanded the film never be shown in his adopted country out of fear for his family's safety, following hate mail and death threats, the exact content and source of which may never be known.<br/><br/>That is not to say the film is NOT shocking. The violence inflicted by Little Alex (Malcolm MacDowell, fresh off that other anti-establishment classic If...) and his droogs is deliberately, sickeningly glorified; it's as if they are playing out their fantasies as if performing on some great stage, complete with their own Shakespearean-style syntax not spoken by straight-cued Ma 'n' Pa (Philip Stone and Sheila Raynor). One of the opening scenes is a ludicrously exaggerated fist-fight played out in a deserted theatre.<br/><br/>Very few redeeming characters raise their head above the mire. As a result, we, as an audience, are left in the unenviable position of sympathising with the calculated, and later stricken, rapist and murderer at the film's centre. Or rather, we are forced to sympathise with his predicament: stripped of his free will, is he truly human at all? Even HAL 9000, the homicidal super-computer from 2001: A Space Odyssey, possessed the power of choice.<br/><br/>Superficially, this is the most dated of Kubrick's films, distinguished by psychedelic art design straight from the turn-of-the-decade era. But we should not allow this to detract from the fact that Kubrick and (original novel writer) Anthony Burgess' future vision is essentially a stylised depiction of logical sociological progression, complete with hyperbole, and just because today's thugs DON'T maraud in bowler hats and over-sized codpieces, spouting pidgin Russian over pints of alcoholic milk, does not make the film-makers' alternative version of reality any less convincing.

Donen emerged from the screening room to find Kubrick pacing nervously outside. ""That was very mischievous,"" Stanley told Stanley.

","i think is important the connection between the violent nature of Alex and Beethoven. But, which may be his reason? I think that perhaps a taste for Beethoven is due to the desire for Alex to preserve his intellectual or classical profile, or perhaps to show through as Beethoven handle his anger. In the music of Beethoven you can see aggressiveness, drama, beauty; perhaps why Alex looked attracted by this music and this music inspired him to commit his acts of violence, either hitting the people or sexually transgress them. Of course he can not be awarded to blame Beethoven by the violent actions of Alex; I also believe that his action was due to their negative attitude towards life and believe that through violence could burn his adrenaline and feel as powerful as he so wished."

","Clockwork orange is an impressive movie. I didn't enjoy the first scenes because this type of movies isn't my favorite, but then I understand the principal reason of it, which in my opinion it is a critical observation to government. The first actor was wonderful, he represents to a sick person who likes doing bad things, and he doesn't realize that is wrong. Some scenes are very strong because they show a lot of violence and terrible crime done by a group of teenagers. I think that the family of Alex is a typical family of United States, because they don't mind their son, when he kill the woman and he went to jail, they rented his bedroom to other man and he became like a son to these people. The mother always had a terrible personal aspect, she wore her hair with horrible colors, and the father was a person without character. That government was an excellent example of one in our days where they thought only in its image. They failed when they wanted to correct the Alex's thoughts with their particular methods and the solution was and is always to give money to the victims after they make mistakes. My favorite part of movie was when Alex met with ""his friends"" and they tried to kill him, and also the rest of the scenes when he met with his victims."

","I believe this is a very interesting film, because it shows the way like the governments of the Satates, during the history, look for putting an end to crime. The movie is a real example of that this purpose is only an illusion and that the criminal politics lose their time implementing strategies of repression and violence. Because, What other thing is prison, death penalty and those kind of corporal punishments but other way of keep and generate much violence in the societies? Perhaps the best way of solve the crime is education and and social inclusion; however one of the parents of the sociology - Émile Durkheim - said that the crime was since the beginning of humanity and will be forever, because that is an structural feature of the society."

","I'm a guy who like quality before quantity. Less is more if you know what I'm saying. So Stanley Kubrick is for obvious reasons one of my all-time favorite directors. He didn't make many movies, but those he made are excellent works of art. And that brings me to my personal favorite of all his movies: A Clockwork Orange.<br/><br/>The film is about a young man named Alexander DeLarge (Malcolm McDowell). He is a guy who likes music, especially Beethoven, but he is also found of rape and ultra violence.<br/><br/>One night however, he get's arrested and goes to jail. In jail he hears about an experiment, were criminals are turned from bad to good. Still, as the priest puts it: ""Goodness is something to be chosen. When a man cannot choose he ceases to be a man."" Alex goes through this experiment and returns to society being, as it seems, ""cured"" from his criminality. Or is he? A Clockwork Orange is a brilliant piece of film-making, making us ask question. What is good and bad about man? What makes us good or bad? And at the same time this is a very psychological movie questioning our own moral code. Do we have the right to force people into goodness? Okay, some people may not like the film. Either because they can't understand the psychological bit or because they don't like the violence. I took this to school once and there were only me and another one who liked it. This is a very raw film, even with todays standards and it's nothing for the faint of heart. But if you wan't to see an intelligent film about the dark side of man, this is a film for you.<br/><br/>""It had been a wonderful evening and what I needed now, to give it the perfect ending, was a little of the Ludwig Van."" - Alex"

A transition not only for the protagonist but also a transition that the viewer and his emotions make as the film progresses. <br/><br/>A film with multiple meaning. A subtle remark on the society, where everyone changes with time. Politicians change, parents change, friends change for their self-interest.

"khuban","10","1","2","26 August 2006"," A Real Horror Show
","I have watched this film on several occasions, from when it came out in 1972 up to the present day. I cannot remember a film a grim, unrelenting, and disturbing as this one. Each time I watch this film, I come away morally disoriented and in a dark and pessimistic state of mind. The world portrayed in this film is one where there is no redemption, no forgiveness - only force, self interest, dominance, revenge, and deception. In the midst of such a world, I find myself empathizing with a totally vicious and despicable sociopath - Alex.<br/><br/>Why? Alex is what he is; a character with a kind of brutal honesty. Alex is the only honest character to be found, and he is immersed in a world of people and systems that are not what they pretend to be, or are attempting to make him something that he is not.<br/><br/>In a world without any moral content, Alex becomes a sympathetic figure, in spite of his vicious and self interested brutality. One is introduced to hell and compelled to sympathize with the devil, since it is only the devil that is truly honest about his evil. Everyone else is either deceiving themselves and others about their malignant darkness or simply pathetic. Fortunately, Kubrick introduces periodic elements of dark humor to break the bleakness and hopelessness of the world that he is presenting here.<br/><br/>It really does not matter though. This is a world of the damned. The film ends without hope, but with only the sense that the same cycle of violence and revenge in a world of unredeemable creatures is condemned to continue.<br/><br/>A real horror show indeed.<br/><br/>So why do I rate this movie so highly? <br/><br/>Perhaps, because it is just too true."

Critic Roger Ebert didn't like this movie, saying it's message is, ""in a world where society is criminal, the citizen might as well be criminal, too."" I think, this movie tries to give voice to a hidden drama. It's meaningless, except as an allegory. <br/><br/>Clockwork Orange is not about violence, or even the future. When the movie begins, it's about the past. 'Alex' representing Britain of the past.<br/><br/>Alex steals and plunders, storing the booty in his drawer at night. A World War is reduced to: a fight between Alex and his gang wearing Bobby-hats and billy clubs and Billy and his boys dressed in German war paraphernalia.<br/><br/>The powers that be decide 'Alex' is in need of reform. He's strapped in a chair (similar to one once used to test viewers emotional responses during movie making) for aversion therapy. He's shown footage of Nazi atrocities while being made to feel bad, ""I can't stop watching!""

Each extracts their vengeance, and of course Alex is now unable to defend himself.<br/><br/>In the end (after Alexs' unforeseen breakdown), to save face, the political class presses Alex to admit, he has been cured of his cure.

"ZildjianDFW","10","1","2","9 April 2006"," My Compliments to Kubrick's ""Clockwork""
","Being a Kubrick fan (as of recently), I dove into this movie with both excitement (it being directed by Kubrick and being considered a classic) and hesitancy (due to its reputation as a depressing film filled with sexual references). At that time, the only other Kubrick films I had seen were ""Dr. Strangelove"", ""Full Metal Jacket"", and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", so I was expecting an awesome, thought-inspiring movie. I was not disappointed. I say now without hesitation that this is my favourite Kubrick movie. The others I've seen were awesome, but this takes the cake.<br/><br/>""Clockwork"" is a very well made movie, showcasing Kubrick's directoral talents in all their glory. The acting, though lacking any actors I'd heard of at the time, was wonderful. Alex was done with sublimity by Mr. McDowell (I believe that's his name, hehe), and was very threatening and dangerous before the treatment, and rightfully innocent and vulnerable after it. I honestly felt sorry for him.<br/><br/>Also, being a classical music fan, the soundtrack, which consisted of it entirely, pleased me deeply. I felt more sympathetic towards Alex, due to his love of Beethoven and, I presume, other classical music.<br/><br/>Despite its disturbing message, it was a wonderfully made movie that pleased me greatly. As always, Kubrick challenges the viewer to think, and perhaps that's why he's my favourite director. And this, to me, is the crowning achievement of his illustrious career. I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys Kubrick, likes to think, or has the stomach for some of the things this film can throw at them. It may not be for everyone, but nonetheless, give it a whirl, and you could, like me, find one of the most powerful and fulfilling movie experiences of your life.<br/><br/>And now I'm done."

","I love this movie. The overall look and atmosphere of the movie is probably what attracts me the most. The colors are fantastic. You could mute the film and just watch and it would keep you interested. I love the reality of the human mind portrayed in Alex DeLarge's character. The coldness he shows towards everyone but himself is something I've seen in others and felt myself. Though a little sick, the humor is great. The actors are very well chosen and believable. Malcom Mcdowel was a fantastic choice for Alex. Other than the comedy and drama of the movie, A Clockwork Orange also has aspects of a horror movie. The things they do to him are frightening. You haven't lived unless you've seen this movie."

","An exceedingly bizarre, unsettling movie in many ways. There weren't too many movies like this coming out in the late 60's, early 70's. The release of this movie made quite a splash in 1971.<br/><br/>Gruesome, humorous, strange look at vulnerability to sociopaths, our strange tendency to, at times, coddle criminals, and a further tendency to jump to extremes to protect ourselves. Extremes which can have horrendous consequences for the subject, but of not much concern for the victims or the public.<br/><br/>An interesting commentary, told in an odd, entertaining way.<br/><br/>Malcolm McDowell is just superb as Alex, the young hood who thinks he is too smart for everybody, who has the tables turned on him."

","Strangely (and scarily) enough the song ""Singin' In th Rain"" was temporarily stuck in my head. You'd understand why after watching this film. A Clockwork Orange is an early Stanley Kubrick work and keeps with his bizarre filmatic perspective. <br/><br/>In some of the more shocking scenes of violence (even for today much less for 1971) the audience follows the horrid acts of a bunch of hoodlums in a strange fantasy world. The portrayed date of the film is subject to debate, possessing many of the conveniences of today yet a setting that seems altogether remote and distant in time. Irregardless, A Clockwork Orange focuses on one individual in particular, 'Alex' de Large (Malcolm McDowell) and his exploits of society in order to satiate his teenage darkly desires. The film starts off with an almost abandonment or anarchy to life, a take or do-as-you-please philosophy (hedonism in short). <br/><br/>We watch as the misguided youth commits all sorts of atrocities at his every whim. He then undergoes a metamorphosis where he is no longer the ""afflictor"" but the afflicted. And in perhaps one of more ironic injustices of a comedic sort, Alex becomes a mistaken hero who further continues to exploit society, not with his vices, but this time with his false virtues. Society is the victim of its own system in producing miscreants who later become ill-gotten champions. Quite a disturbing look at things that don't seem too far off the beaten path, even if a bit exaggerated! 7/10"
"SheBear","Null","1","2","1 July 2004"," Ultra Brilliance
","The future never looked so much like 1971 than in A Clockwork Orange and that could be a problem if you saw the film in 1971 but looking at it in 2004, the past starts to look the same as the future because both seem worlds away.<br/><br/>A Clockwork Orange is one of my favorite books and one of my favorite films. I like the artificiality of the language in Anthony Burgess' book and I like the artificiality of the sets and the costumes in Stanley Kubrick's film.  The fact that Malcolm McDowell is way too old for the role is just another example of the artifice.  But McDowell is perfectly mischievous and you can't imagine anyone else as Alex.<br/><br/>The violence is operatically sinister and exhilarating and that can cause problems for satirically challenged viewers.  But irony is the most interesting and effective way to tackle the subject of violence<br/><br/>It is well known that Burgess' last chapter was left out of the American book version and out of Kubrick's film and that, without that chapter, the author's point was lost.  Burgess believed that a clockwork orange did not exist, meaning that man is not destined to be either wholly good or wholly evil because of control of god or the state - because free will exists. Since the film ends with evil Alex made `good' by the state, and thus being `cured, alright' he is a clockwork orange and that was not the message that the author meant to convey.  But it is a powerfully memorable ending to an amazing film."
"andy.marshall","Null","1","2","6 June 2004"," Kubrick's Vision?
","A flawed masterpiece, especially where Kubrick detours from the vision of Anthony Burgess.<br/><br/>Much of the comments about this movie refer to ""Kubrick's Vision"", unquote. The problem with that perspective is that the best parts of this movie are those that directly translate the novel by Anthony Burgess. The worst parts are those that Kubrick and his designers came up with themselves.<br/><br/>
For instance, the original novel was set in a much more Orwellian world of dark staircases, concrete decor and the smell of cabbage. The so-called ""vision"" of Kubrick and his designers gives us what must have seemed very futuristic then but now appears so very 1971. Look at the decor of the Korova milk bar with it's naked female sculptures dispensing drencrom from the breast. Look at Alex's apartment with its silver and golden walls. Look at his parents in their oh so 1970 clothes. Look at ""Home"" cottage where Mr. Alexander and his ill fated wife live - looks more like a trendy 1970 flat in Chelsea!<br/><br/>In yet another case of the Emperor's new clothes, ""Kubrick's vision"" is, ultimately what fails this movie."

"Cowman","Null","1","2","6 May 2004"," A thoughtful and stylish film, although deeply troubling.
","Filmmaker Stanley Kubrick was no stranger to controversy.  Even though most of his efforts were highly praised by critics everywhere, films like PATHS OF GLORY, LOLITA, and DR. STRANGELOVE rubbed a lot of people the wrong way. The same can be said about his 1971 film, A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, which received huge critical acclaim despite the fact that it is without a doubt the most notorious title in his filmography.  A CLOCKWORK ORANGE is indeed an excellent picture, but it's not hard to see why it has earned such a sordid reputation.<br/><br/>Watching A CLOCKWORK ORANGE is like immersing yourself in a barbaric, futuristic nightmare.  The cops are corrupt, the government is increasingly intrusive, and the kids are getting their jollies from raping, robbing, and rumbling.  In other words, it's just like today--only much more surreal.<br/><br/>Kubrick's vision of a violent, sadistic future is uniquely disturbing. Rather than showing the chaotic, digitized, robotized, post- or near-apocalyptic future that we're all used to seeing in other sci-fi movies, Kubrick opts for a colorful, vibrant, and unfittingly serene landscape.  The interiors are darkly lit and uncomfortably roomy, the furniture is gaudy and abstract, and the architecture is almost Escher-like in its complexity.  This sort of `neo-apocalyptic' setting is most likely what makes the film all the more alarming, since we as viewers are not accustomed to seeing such primitive acts of violence and barbarism atop a vibrant, modern-art backdrop.  Even the graphically violent scenes are orchestrated in an upbeat and dance-like fashion, such as the scene wherein Alex and his droogs sexually assault a woman to the tune of ""Singin' in the Rain"".<br/><br/>The messages in A CLOCKWORK ORANGE are equally troubling.  The film clearly stresses the importance of the human right to a free will, but it also makes clear the problems that come along with such a right--namely, that given the choice, many people will choose to be hateful and vicious, simply because they can be.  A CLOCKWORK ORANGE also seems to suggest that there is no hope for dangerous individuals such as Alex; that those who lack a conscience now will lack a conscience forever, regardless of what happens to them--a troubling message indeed.<br/><br/>Though much of A CLOCKWORK ORANGE is overtly shocking, it is still a relatively humble film.  It is evident that Kubrick had a lot to say with this movie, but rather than deliberately blurt his ideas at the viewer to get his point across, he wisely chose to implement the tiniest of subtleties in order to convey his messages.  This is what makes A CLOCKWORK ORANGE stay fresh and interesting, even with repeat viewings.  It is one of those films where no matter how many times one sees it, he will always pick up on something new."
"ks4","7","1","2","30 April 2004"," Good movie, but too complex for this type of movie.
","They say Stanley Kubrick has always been ahead of his time, and considering the age of this movie, that is probably true, this is a very a sharp critical movie, still it contains a high amount of social realism though, it's a twisted movie that is very hard to sit through, but leaves you thinking.<br/><br/>Alexander De Large and his gang is a product of a numb society, for fun they entertain themself with violent acts towards whomever crosses their way, Alex is the leader of the gang, the others go in his path and does what he wants, one day though two of them objects and wants to be equal, Alex doesn't agree and starts a fight, after that things go back to normal, Alex in charge, but his gang is no longer his friends. He is betrayed and is sent to a prison, to get out early he volunteers for a program that is supposed to help him out of his violent path.<br/><br/>Kubrick has always had a very experimental style, and even though this mvoie is hard to watch, it's still very powerfull and have a very realistic (even though the movie itself is portrayed unrealistic and fantasy alike). The movie spends a lot of time on the act of violence, and Kubrick's morale point of view is never in doubt, but then again, it always appears to be in doubt, because i dont think that i ever managed to figure out completely what the meaning was with the plot, just as i thought i was on a straight path, understanding everything, the movie turns and goes in the opposite direction, it's definetely a complex movie, that for full understanding has to be watched more than once, problem also is that it's hard to sit through, Kubrick uses the soundtrack perfectly, especially in the start, Beethoven is nearly constantly playing, but as soon as Alex is arrested, it stops. And from here it only plays occasionally as he gets cured, but in the end the path comes back to hunt him, together with the music.<br/><br/>Of course this is Kubrick's movie, his directing habits shines through in all his movies, because he is a genius, and a true master, this movie is very powerfull, but i think also maybe too complex. Kubrick has his own style and his own way of saying it, i think not all will understand this movie, but the ones that do will think it's a masterpiece, this movie will divide the audience, some will understand it and think it's brilliant, another large group will think it's jibberish, and then there'll be the ones still trying to figure out how all the puzzles fits together, the movie is very symbolic, colors and music displays a lot of the meaning of the movie. In one remarkable scene in the start we see Alex and his gang attacking an elderly man sitting in a tunnel, as Alex and his gangs walks in their shadows grow long down towards the old homeless man, i think this specific scene tells a lot about what the initiave with the movie is, it's a symbolic movie. Which is also one of the reasons why i believe it has to be watched more than once for full understanding.<br/><br/>
Another thing that is interesting in this movie is the special use of the language, it's obvious that Kubrick was thinking in a futuristic style while taping the movie, the language is unique and gives the movie a weird touch, though interesting, the movie is very experimental as other Kubrick movies, it does seem like he is trying to look into the future and predict the future of a numb society.<br/><br/>Malcolm McDowell is Alexander De Large, and he fills out this complex and interesting character very well, he is the only of the chracters that shines through, all the others pretty much fades to the background, perhaps because the story doesn't stop at them long, there are many supporting characters playing various roles and they all appear in different parts of the movie for a little while.<br/><br/>The movies strength is definetely the directing and storyline, Kubrick dared to check chances, a movie like this nobody else could have made at this time, he is unique and that's what shines through in this movie, this experimental director has created a movie that will and should never be forgotten, because it's a landmark in cinematic history. However, to me it doesn't stand as the masterpiece of all time, mainly becuase it's too complex, and at times too long, but the complicated way it's directed is what makes it hard to understand, so for me it's both a strength and a weakness, strength because it's unique and original and it will stay in your thoughts for a good while, weak because it's very hard to absorbe and understand, and it's almost definate that it has to be watched more than once for full understanding, something that isn't always a good thing, especially considering that it isn't an easy movie to sit through.<br/><br/>7/10"

Kubrick definitely improves drastically later on and becomes a phenominal director, but this proves his amaturety at this point. Everything just has a corny look to it. I couldn't take any of it seriously. It was too tedious. This is the kind of movie I'd want to be dark and serious and disturbing. And the cheeze-ball music makes it even more rediculous. The last complaint is the horrible representation of a futuristic society. Some scenes look less futurstic than today's look and other's have an obviously fake futuristic atmosphere.

"silentium","10","1","2","30 July 2003"," A real horror show, that.
","As you may be able to tell from my reviews that I expect a lot from any Kubrick offering, as I've only been marginally let down on one occasion by good 'ol Stanley, and that film was Spartacus. It doesn't feel like a Kubrick film to me, and there's not much artistry to it.<br/><br/>But, in films like this and his other visual masterpiece Barry Lyndon; art is rampant and it takes a lot to squeeze everything in. So much happens in the course of this film it's insane. It's fast-paced, intense, brilliantly acted and scored.<br/><br/>From a board, I've something I said in trying to 'prove' to someone this film was good, since saying the same thing twice would be a bit trivial, I now quote myself; (I'm lazy)<br/><br/>Malcolm McDowell's performance is brilliant and energetic while being subtle at the same time. He delivers his lines well without looking like he's reading for the sake of the script. He didn't play Alex -- he became Alex.<br/><br/>
Stanley Kubrick's direction is astounding here. More-so than other Kubrick films I'd say. Watch how he conducts his camera so methodically. After the singing in the rain bit (in which Alex sung to the estranged writer) how they walk back through the milk-bar. The camera is first focused on the stairs as the come down it, as they advance towards the camera it begins to back up; after that it spirals to the side and then behind them and follows them. Also, when they first meet with the old man when they're coming up to him all you can see is their shadows cast on the wall before him. Beautiful moments are strewn about everywhere. Such as when Alex is walking home from the milk-bar, to his home (the first time we see it; before the brilliant directed 9th symphony montage as he's going to sleep) and he's walking through an abandoned futuristic court-yard of sorts and all you can hear is a somber whisper. <br/><br/>The music is used well in every scene, and sometimes it's to the point where it reminds of the imagery produced by the original disney film Fantasia. I don't have to explain the music being great, I doubt you question that.<br/><br/>
The story, to me, is imaginative and brilliant. A writer, writing of his wife being murdered by hooligans is writing a story, the story we're watching, thus he's writing about a writer who's in the book he's writing about writing about the book he's in. It's brilliant because it's a poetic pi; which is very hard to create. <br/><br/>The questions on moral choice have given me nice long thoughts at night. Think about it; so Alex was a rapist and a murderer; is that crime enough to take away his humanity by stripping him of moral choice. Stripping someone of their ability to choose is worse than murder. <br/><br/>So many things happen within the film, think about it. It comes on and things spiral into the main story. Many many many memorable scenes and they're all done so well. First, they beat up an old man, terrorize the road and then go to the writer's home. After they make their way back to the milk-bar and things continue to happen rapidly. Events pour in and out in a constant and well timed pace for it all. <br/><br/>It's more imaginative and unique than any movie I've ever seen. It's one of a kind and will never be copied without complete failure. The Usual Suspects plot has, and will be done, again. Same with these other movies with the 'great twists' at the end. They're just fluff with no moral center, no questions about humanity or anything else that actually matters. A Clockwork Orange is a character study and portrait of evil. The Usual Suspects is a quotable action flick with a 'twist.' The made up language delighted me throughout the film. There's no way you could predict the ending to this film, there's too many possibilities. <br/><br/>As for you saying I need to watch mindless action movies -- that offends me. I do, but I dont hold them in too high of a regard. Such as Leon, I watch it for it's mindless action. Like Raiders of the Lost Ark and other action films. I love the stupid flick as much as the next guy -- but they dont really matter to me. They're not art -- they're just entertaining portraits. Art is something that makes a statement. The one reason people rate this lowly is because I think people get other ideas of what the ending should be; and as sporadic as this film is, I don't believe there's anyway to predict the ending.<br/><br/>A+: Anyone who appreciates film as an art medium should experience this."

","A Clockwork Orange is undeniably one of the greatest and most original films ever made and, in my opinion, Kubrick's greatest work. The intricacy with which Kubrick unravels his nightmare-ish vision of a futuristic, violent people is unrelenting and amazing.<br/><br/>I have never been able to find a problem with this movie and yet it stands above so many others in complexity and scale of vision in terms of both the story and the composition of the film itself, indeed ideal breeding ground for mistakes and complaints. But there are none that I can find.<br/><br/>There is one small notion, oft-stated that the film is not as shocking or provocative these days as when it was first released. That I can't argue with; these days we seem to have become more desensitized to sex and violence in films and can only wonder why this film in particular was banned when it first came out. But while the action in the film does not have quite the same impact, it cannot possibly detract in the slightest from Kubrick's artistic vision. The story, the characters, the scenery and the occasional spurts of savage irony are as impressive and awe-inspiring today as they ever were, and time cannot wear them down. Full marks to Malcolm McDowell in the lead performance as well. 5 stars out of 5."

"descendent528","10","1","2","17 June 2003"," Well Well Welly Well Well What's it Going to Be Then Eh?
","What a day it has been my droogies, for I have completed the novel (in just under a week at that) and viewed Stanely Kubrick's take on it in the same waking day. I, sadly saw the film before reading the book but to my advantage, the first and only time that I had seen the film was nearly a year and a half ago. However, while reading the book I know what is going to come next and I cannot use my imagination to create my own image of the characters and their surroundings. Fortunatly, Stanley Kubrick did a wonderful job with the characters and I believe, the story as well. I do not believe that anyone else aside from Malcom McDowell could have filled the big and blood coated shoes of Alex as well as he. His performance in the film is marvelous and unforgetteble. I had planned to read the book and had it in my possession when a friend of mine encouraged me to read it, yet mentioned that the film did the book no justice. I disagree, for I think the film follows the book very well with the exception of a few bits and pieces and age differences (though we can't very well have a group of men raping a ten year old girl on screen can we?) which, actually, takes away from the power of the book. The fact being, in the book Alex is 15 years old and the film shows him as much older, not much, 3 or 4 years perhaps but still, a great difference. One difference that fell ill with me (Spoilers) was the discovery by Alexander that Alex was the one whom had been in on the brutal rape of his wife all those years ago. The discovery in the book is slow and picked up through Alex's use of language to Alexander. This was one of my favorite parts of the book and was saddened at not finding it done in the film. The language used in the book is so wonderfully used and executed and leaves such an impact, i figure that it could be rather hard to put onscreen and to be completely understood by the audience in just two hours. The book allows you to learn the language as you go along and now, I find myself speaking in minor nadsat in daily conversation. For instance, someone asks how I am doing and I give them a ""Real horrorshow"" and kind of chuckle a malankey bit. My suggestion: Read the book first and watch the movie. I believe that Stanley Kubrick has done a very good job at adapting this book and producing this film on its behalf. Wonderfully directed, acted, scored, and shot, I really like this story a lot, but that's another story with politics and such that I do not feel like getting into at the moment."
"didi-5","Null","1","2","8 June 2003"," a disturbing film
","Kubrick had veered towards the disturbing in his movie plots before (the paedophilic in ""Lolita"", the insane and corrupt in ""Dr Strangelove"", the menace of technology in ""2001"").  In ""A Clockwork Orange"" he takes this to the limit in his story of Alex Burgess, a cultured psychopath (he listens to Beethoven and speaks in an unusual patois to his 'droogs') who is seen carrying out various attacks, rape, and eventually murder over two nights, before he is sent to prison and added to an intensive programme of torture and rehabilitation.  The first third of the film deals with the atrocities he carries out before his arrest, but the bulk of Kubrick's vision centres on the methods employed by the state to turn Alex into a reformed character, incapable of response and filled only with the desire to do good.  After release he leaves only to find further torments await. <br/><br/>
The characters, apart from Alex (played brilliantly by Malcolm McDowell), are little more than cyphers, cartoon characters on the periphery of his life.  These include Warren Clarke as one of his 'droogs', Adrienne Costi and Miriam Karlin as his victims, Steven Berkoff as a police thug, David Prowse as a sinister carer, and Clive Francis as the oily lodger who has taken Alex's place in his parents' flat.  Only Patrick Magee as the liberal writer who plays a pivotal role in Alex's life early and late in the film has a meaty role amongst the remaining cast.  <br/><br/>Is the film any good, and worth the hype after all these years of officially being unseen?  Hard to say.  Kubrick uses music again to good effect as he had throughout ""2001"", and the message from Anthony Burgess' original novel comes through.  However, ""A Clockwork Orange"" has to be viewed with mixed feelings, both for the subject matter and for the antihero himself.  My guess is the final jury will remain out for a long time yet."
"Blade_Le_Flambeur","10","1","2","7 June 2003"," Sensational, a beautiful montage of music, feelings, and images
","Stanley Kubrick's probably two most infamous films are A Clockwork Orange and Eyes Wide Shut. At the 1971 Academy Awards, this film was nominated for Best Picture, Director, Adapted Screenplay, and Editing. It is so very hard to put the brilliance of A Clockwork Orange into words. The film works on so many levels, from the brilliant score to the top of the line acting and the satirical photography. Many people have called it shocking and disturbing, but Steven Speilberg's Saving Private Ryan is 10 X as worse. As the troubled but ultimately intelligent Alex, Malcolm M. shines in his role by ultimately conveying a sort of child- like quality and at the same time a distant violent nature. He is perfectly adapted from the Alex in the novel. All the other actors do perfectly fine jobs, especially the Prison Chaplin who puts the ultimate message of the film into a few basic sentences. Kubrick's refined script is excellent, and is almost the exact same as the novel. Some minor details that have changed is that he focuses a bit too much on the ultra- violence and rape, and there is a lot less of the funny language that Alex and his pals use. Kubrick's direction treats this as a satire, and the viewer has all these images sent to his head. There are so many sequences when he suddenly does slow motion or when he puts it as if it's fast forward. Overall, A Clockwork Orange is everything you've heard and more. It's not exactly the most violent or disturbing film ever created, though there is quite a bit of nudity. It's a towering achievement from everyone involved, cast and crew alike and deserves to be on the top 10 films of all time. Amazing film, definitely my new favorite. 10/10"

","Probably one of the most controversial ""oscar-nominated"" films ever (1971) - Because of copy-cat violence (that the film was blamed for) director Stanley Kubrick withdrew it from circulation in Britain a year after its release. A Clockwork Orange (based on the 1962 satiric novel by Anthony Burgess) startles, mesmerizes & hypnotizes with its unique brand of futurism, criminal posh, dehumanization, and higher moralities. It flows into unchartered territory with each passing scene, and can easily astonish the weakest of minds. The character development in this film is quite extraordinary because you really can't predict the eventual outcomes & relationships of the cast, most of which meet under bizarre circumstances to begin with. <br/><br/>My favorite scene is when Alex de Large (played by McDowell) is overcome with heavenly bliss while listening to Beethoven's 9th Symphony, and then trances out on his porcelain statues of dancing Jesuses, his pet snake Basil, and his own sadistic realm of erotic pop art & dementia. All of this represents the various conflicting elements of good vs. evil in his life. The pace of the film comes to a crashing halt when young Alex is sent off to a stripey hole (prison) after being convicted of murdering the female proprietor of a health farm - by bludgeoning her to death with a large sculpture of a rocking penis.<br/><br/>The film was defeated in four Academy Awards categories by William Friedkin's The French Connection, but has since grown into an international cult phenomenon. I had the luxury of viewing this masterful gem in London during a re-release in 1999 (not long after the passing of the great Kubrick). All I can say is that this movie is still as fresh, obscene & tantalizing as it was in 1971.<br/><br/>Be sure to pay close attention to the oblique synthesized electronic score by Walter Carlos, as it complements the frighteningly decadent cityscapes of a ""very near"" future. Some people might also find it difficult to follow this film which uses lots of foreign ""Nadsat slang"" language -- primarily used by Alex and his gang of Droogs. If you'd like to know the translations of these words and phrases be sure to check out any of the many Clockwork Orange dictionary or Nadsat websites."

","The film based on the book is an intriguing view of choice, personality and the morality of society and the media.  It centres around the main character, Alex de Large, and his gang of young adventurers who terrorise people for the sheer pleasure of it.  But this is not the point of the story.  The story is concerned ultimately with the right to choose how to live: to be an individual.  Should a criminal be kept essentially human by being allowed to live criminally, as is his nature or nurture, and be punished for their crimes, or be transformed into a ""good person"" through deliberate conditioning for the safety of other citizens?<br/><br/>The film takes great effort to reveal points on both sides in the backdrop of a strange nihilistic, almost cyber-punk world with fine acting, direction, and atmospheric music by Walter (now Wendy) Carlos.  The film was banned in Britain by the director, Stanley Kubrick, until recently which added to the mystic of the film, at least here in Britain.<br/><br/>This is a film to watch and in my view, the first film of this genre recognisable today as a ""modern film"" in its execution and, in some cases, a truer representation of today than one may, at first, realise."

There are a few graphic images that most would not enjoy watching consistently but there is a point in it. Kubrick doesn't film nudity or violence for enjoyment but rather to make a statement. After 30 minutes the rating of the film has been justified but soon the viewer must pay attention to the scene with the priest in the library. If you wonder what statement was being made by this movie, then listen to what the priest tells our main character."

","A Clockwork Orange is probably the most merciless story about society, the most convincing of critical statements ever made. We awe it first to Anthony Burgess, then to Stanley Kubrick. Kubrick, while treating Burgess's text respectfully, made the very best out of the wonderful plot. He managed to bring it across visually with almost more wit and creativity than any reader of the book can imagine for himself. He crowds his stylish futuristic world with an excellent leading actor and with an uncountable number of (stereo)types that are so funny and so funnily played that the movie is not depressing despite its disturbing topic. When during the end credits the song `Singin' in the Rain' rings out, I will sing along jollily, despite what the song stands for in the movie. Generally, the music, virtuously conducted, is an important element in the film and  again  a brilliant one. And the production design! The Korova Milkbar alone is a masterpiece.<br/><br/>A Clockwork Orange is Kubrick's most original film  although it does not have an original screenplay."

","Its not a bad movie, I found the expected conformity of the Government and society interesting, also the use of music throughout was very clever.  My opinion of the scenes of violence was that they were not all that grotesque and although still disturbing were watchable however, I could not help but feel a little bored by the repetitive sexual references and pretty naked ladies (it has now come to my attention why so many males like this movie.) I am not saying that nudity is wrong but I did feel that on some occasions it was completely unjust for example the topless woman on stage whilst performing the experiment was just plain well, ridiculous.  I also felt that the government characters were potrayed in a very stereotypical biased type fashion on a whole and were robotic and calculated much like the 'droogs' themselves which for me was just too one sided."

The music composed by Wendy Carlos is incredible, it matches perfectly with Kubrick's filming style. I don't think i really need to say anything about the direction, I mean it was directed by the master of film; Stanley Kubrick. The film may require multiple viewings for some people, it's nothing like normal hollywood garbage. I myself could watch it unlimited times and never get bored. From the opening shot the film draws you in and doesn't let go until the end. Stanley Kubrick is the best film maker of all time for many reasons, one being that he can make A Comedy, a Horror, a Sci-Fi, a few war, and some films which cannot be categorized, and all of them define the genre. This movie is shocking at times, funny, disturbing, and always very strange."

"Ex_Offender","10","1","2","13 September 2002"," Near-Flawless Masterpiece of Black Comedy and Political Satire
","Arguably Kubrick's greatest film, and certainly one of the greatest films ever. This complex, engaging work functions on many levels - as future prophecy, social commentary, political satire and anthropological philosophy.<br/><br/>***Spoilers***<br/><br/>The machinations of the amoral Alex centre around random acts of violence, perpetrated not out of malice but simply for the sheer thrill. 'Alex' (which in Greek means 'without law') embodies the irrepressible human spirit at its best, in his love of Beethoven, and its worst, in his penchant for rape and the old ultra-violence. Alexander De Large, an obvious play on Alexander The Great,  represents the 'delightful orange' as it is had in Burgess' book, unspoilt by regulation.<br/><br/>The similarities to Alexander The Great are shown when Alex' leadership of the droogs is put to the test - faced with the Gordian (`George-ian'?) knot of dissent among the ranks,  Alex responds with the Alexandrian solution of beating the two into submission. But this first-seen attempt at enforcing order fails, as will occur again in the film... and Alex is left, betrayed by his droogs, to be picked up by the police.<br/><br/>A key point much glossed over by detractors of the film is the remorse Alex shows when he learns that he has murdered the cat woman. This may be seen in two lights: on the one hand, if he shows remorse, he cannot be viewed as a total monster, on the other if he knows what he does is wrong, he must face responsibility for his actions. This dichotomy is central to the film - the conflict between the optimistic and pessimistic views of humanity.<br/><br/>Also of note is the rank hypocrisy of the police and Alex' Corrections Officer. The police brutalise Alex, and Deltoid spits in his face. They are in reality no more inherently decent than the droogs themselves - they merely work for the other side.<br/><br/>In prison, Alex is subjected to total dehumanisation, becoming Prisoner #655321, and is treated like a child. However, as humanity has always done, Alex adapts himself to the new regime, currying favour with the prison chaplain, performing duties and studying the bible. But it is palpably false - he enjoys the bible, yes, but mostly the Old Testament, which features more violence. The only part of the New Testament he really enjoys is the crucifixion, seeing himself `helping in like, and even taking charge... dressed in the height of Roman fashion.'<br/><br/>Once volunteered for the Ludovico technique, Alex is injected with drugs and forced to view violent films scored with the very music he loves. An interesting thing to note is the eye-drops being put in Alex' eyes to prevent his retinas from scratching - the net effect is that Dr Brodsky is forcing Alex to watch violent films, and putting tears in his eyes. Facing the prospect of prolonged sessions, Alex pleads for mercy, calling the methodology a 'sin', to which Brodsky responds: `What's all this about sin?' Again, those in control of Alex are shown to be no more moral than he.<br/><br/>Alex then claims to be reformed, seeing that what he has done in the past is wrong, `terribly wrong! It's wrong because it's like against society.' This is an obvious feint, but it is significant that a voluntary confession of wrongdoing is rejected in favour of enforced morality.<br/><br/>When Alex' complete passivity is demonstrated, his tormentor embodies repulsive Middle-England toadishness. Clearly the Ludovico technique will render the  common criminal as putty in the hands of the  professional (the jackbooted, heel-clicking prison officer approves). Hilariously the actor, when bowing to applause for his performance, generously acknowledges Alex - politics has been replaced by show business. And a more sinister aspect of the treatment is revealed: Alex is unable to feel lustful thoughts: he experiences the same feelings of horror as when exposed to violence. The chaplain's objections are swiftly shouted down by the Minister of the Interior: 'The point is that it works!'<br/><br/>Released into society, Alex is rejected by his parents - again the society against which he has rebelled is lacking: only when Alex is really helpless and genuinely needs his parents do they abandon him. The irrepressible human spirit strikes out truly alone for the first time.<br/><br/>The sense of justice felt at the scene in which Alex is attacked by vengeful septuagenarian tramps is quickly replaced by a feeling of uncertainty - since Alex is truly helpless, how can revenge be morally justified? Willingly or no, he has changed. And it feels horribly wrong for Georgie and Dim to not only escape punishment, but to become enforcers of the law. But as Alex approaches the 'HOME' he ransacked earlier in the film, we sense that a full circle is being described.<br/><br/>That it is Alex' newly-returned sense of carefree well-being that allows the writer to identify Alex as his wife's rapist is a wonderful irony - th e same carefree spirit caused such horror and mayhem the last time we heard 'Singin' In The Rain'.<br/><br/>Clearly F. Alexander is no more for 'the people' than the oppressive Government he opposes: 'Not the people, they'd exchange [freedom] for a quieter life.' Again hypocrisy is shown at every hand's turn. Alex is again tortured by those who claim to wish him well.<br/><br/>Once at the hospital, it quickly becomes clear that Alex has been changed back to his old self again, in the hilarious scene with the pictures for him to supply words for. The rather heavy-handed satire of the now-apologetic Minister literally spoon-feeding Alex is something that has perhaps not aged well, but the overall idea is conveyed excellently. Again PR is substituted for politics, and we learn that F. Alexander has been arrested ('for his own protection', according to the Minister, but we can't help remembering the 'political offenders' of whom he spoke earlier). The undertones are at once comical, chilling, thought-provoking and gratifying, as amidst the hoop-la and fuss Alex reveals that he is indeed 'cured all right!'"

Stanley Kubrick was a genius, and in this movie you can see it so well, that will take a long time for you to forget how much you enjoyed it.

","This movie is a must see for any fan of any Stanley Kubrick film.  Great acting, great plot, and most of all, great visuals.  Even though it doesn't ave the controversial last chapter from the book, it is still a great movie. But this movie is not for everyone.  If you can't stand gratuitous violence or rape scenes, I advise you to stay away from it.  But, if you're like me and love a good movie that doesn't care who it offends, go for it.

"jaesboxer","10","1","2","25 June 2002"," My Favorite Movie Of All Time!
","Stanley Kubrick's dark, ultra-violent and morbidly witty masterpiece is a film that cannot be seen indifferently.  Those who view it fall distinctly into two seperate and opposed attitudes:  Those who think it is nauseatingly sick, and those who love it.  I fall into the latter category.  This is my all time favorite movie.  It is probably one of the most controversial films in history, and certainly Kubrick's most daring.  The entire length of the movie, adapted from Anthony Burgess' dark novel, is unrelentingly violent, horrifying and if you can laugh at those things, you'll love it.  THe story is as fascinating as the main character Alex, dealing with the concept of human choice in a delightfully sadistic way.  But the concept itself is not the only attraction, Alex himself creates a positively delightful love-hate relationship between himself and the viewer.  His napoleanic complex and fascination with his own sense of control is brilliantly portrayed by Malcolm MacDowell.  When released in 1971, this film received an X-Rating, and while it would be less controversial today, it still has enough violence, sex, nudity, rape and sadism to transcend almost all the films punched out by today's ultra-violent, MTV driven culture.  In conclusion, while not a film for everyone, A Clockwork ORange is an undisputed masterpiece with an everlasting appeal for those of use who can laugh at ""a bit of the ole' ultra-violence."""
"Thermo","10","1","2","7 July 1999"," The violence is a mechanism to get the deeper meanings across
","This is not some flick with random violence and a simple message.  Make no mistake, the violence is horrifying.  It's meant that way.  It's meant to be a reflection on how society was progressing in the future, where for some ultraviolence is a way of life.<br/><br/>This movie can be divided into thirds.  The first third delves into the madness of violence, and the horror a few ultraviolent individuals can produce in a society.  The second third is about reformation and the price of reformation - can a society take away an individual's right to free will to protect itself?  The final third is again a commentary on violence - this time that the violence is inherent in our society, that we are ALL products, and instigators, of violence.  We're not supposed to feel sorry for Alex! We're supposed to feel happy that he's getting what he deserves!!  But that's the mastery of the film - in the end our lust for revenge is no different that Alex's ultraviolence, and the ""treatment"" eventually blows up in the government's and societies' and in our (the audience's) face.  Alex ends up the same as always, just much richer and with immunity from the consequences of his actions.<br/><br/>This film is violent.  It is disturbing.  It questions the lines between justice and revenge, beauty and horror, societies' greater need and an individual's basic human rights.  It does so against a backdrop that is at once soothing (Beethoven's ninth) and horrifying (the ultraviolence). A Clockwork Orange is brilliant, but to appreciate its full impact, one has to get over the brutality of the film.  The deeper meanings will be lost to anyone who can't."

","I have seen a lot of movies in my day, but few have changed my life. This movie-called ""THE movie"" by those who know me-is quite simply the masterpiece. Just like one of my fellow reviewers said, my life, or at least as it pertains to movies, was changed when I saw this film. It is among the top 3 most profound movies I've ever seen. I watched it five times in the first two days I had the video in my possession. I own the video now, and the book, and the score, and a poster. I wrote a paper about Kubrick, with the focus heavily on ""A Clockwork Orange."" I can't even begin to state the cinematic importance of this movie. You must see it for yourself. Stanley Kubrick was a man before his time, a film-maker with the sort of vision and technique and talent that all artists hope and pray for in their endeavors, no matter the forum. ""A Clockwork Orange"" is just one of his masterworks. With only 13 films, he changed the practice of film-making forever. May all be well with your eternity, Stanley, and thanks forever for sharing with us your beautiful, bitter soul."

","This film is meant to make the viewer uncomfortable, to think, to be repulsed by Alex, to feel sympathy for him, to feel tricked and betrayed by Kubrick - by the film itself, for allowing it to manipulate your feelings about violence, about retribution, about Alex and his kind. Just as the social workers toy with Alex, Kubrick toys with the viewer, first throwing violent scenes all involving helpless victims at the unsuspecting moviegoer, then later turning Alex himself into the helpless victim. As the film progresses, Kubrick continues to challenge any conclusions one may come to: viewers appalled at the behavior modification techniques used to ""cure"" Alex can conclude the solution is as awful as the crime. If you agree Alex should be reformed at any cost, then at the film's end, one of its many jokes is played on you. I heard rave reviews of the film after it came out in the early 70's, but didn't see it until 15 years later. After having wanted to see it for so long, I was disturbed at first by the repulsive violence and let down at my own dismay about the film. It wasn't until I taped it, and viewed it over and over, that I understood and experienced what Kubrick was intending. Repeated viewings also gave me a chance to appreciate each element of Kubrick's impeccable and always entertaining filmmaking. Anyone who is reacting mostly to the film's violence, either disgusted by it or unimpressed because it doesn't match the realism or intensity of violence on film today, hasn't really gotten it yet. Try watching again."

NOTHING! Oh the rape scene? It was like 5 minutes! Not even the stuff they showed Alex to brainwash him was very shocking at all. Hell no, this movie had hardly any violence! If you want to see REAL ultra violence, watch Fist of The North Star (animated). That is the greatest movie ever. So I was disappointed. But I wouldn't let that be the judge of the movie. So people blew the shock value of it all out of proportion? So what, it was still a good, entertaining movie, right?<br/><br/>HELL NO, the thing was BORING. It was worth watching, no doubt, to see what would happen next, but still. It wasn't exciting, it wasn't suspenseful or captivating.

","Oh, my droogies, a horrorshow peek at the old ultraviolence to which our humble near future is heir...<br/><br/>Once again, Kubrick took a novel and adapted it with utter faith to the screen, while simultaneously creating a visual style that was utterly unique.  On top of it all, he gives us the character of Alex -- thug, rapist, delinquent, unrepentent little s**t -- and makes us like him, even as he attacks, injures, rapes and kills...<br/><br/>This film (and the novel), you see, really isn't about Alex and his Droogies.  It's about us -- our attitudes toward crime and punishment, and our weird ambivalence and denial.  We love to claim to want to see justice done, but never make us admit that all we really want is revenge.  We can't admit that -- it would just make us the same as the criminals.  However, the ""Ludovicko technique"" seen in the film, the Pavlovian reprogramming of criminals, really would be the ultimate solution to crime.  Turning the violent into little clockwork oranges -- objects that look organic on the outside but are mechanical on the inside -- would solve a lot of problems. However, it's a concept that'll never fly.  Not because it's cruel to the criminals, altough lipservice is paid to that idea.  No -- it's because it denies society the opportunity to smack the doo-doo out of the nasty little thugs.  But, see the comments on hypocrisy, above...<br/><br/>And all of this is in the movie implicitly, never explicit.  (The high point: when Alex encounters his former gang mates, now ""reformed,"" working as policemen -- and behaving exactly the same as before.)<br/><br/>The formula of crime and punishment is really a perpetuating loop, not a one-way track, but the punishers can never admit to their own criminal behavior.  This equation is hiding in the structure of the film, which is a classic fairy tale -- hero journeys outward and passes three obstacles (or gate keepers or trolls or whatever), then journeys back in a diminished state, and encounters the same three whatevers for some instant karma. The concept was the genius of Anthony Burgess, but the faithful execution (pardon the expression) was pure Kubrick...<br/><br/>Final notes: the film is funny, stuffed with little in-jokes (keep your eyes open in the record store for some self-references, as well as a collection of names that actually became bands later) and the use of music and wide-angle lenses has no equal in cinema.  The opening shot is one of the more memorable images in film, the closing shot is a subtle ""up yours"" to Ken Russell, and everything in between will stick with you forever..."

The subject matter is still appalling and hard to watch, but I wish those directors of the Van Damme/Schwartzenegger school of movies would watch this to really learn what violence is.<br/><br/>As always, a cast of relative unknowns makes the movie sparkle and Malcolm MacDowell's all-out performance is spellbinding."

When I saw it two days ago, I thought that maybe reading a lot about it would make the actual film disappointing.  It was better than I had read about.  This is the greatest film ever made - better than The Professional, and that takes some beating.  The overacting by the minor characters is excellent, as is Malcolm McDowell.  Why this film didn't win all sorts of awards for art direction and costume design is beyond me.  (as well as for best film, director, actor, editing, cinematography and adapted screenplay)  Kubrick uses music in such a brilliant way, like in 2001, (notice its display at the record store) making for a great experience for eyes and ears.

","Stanley Kubrick's ode to personal freedom at any cost is one of the most amoral movies ever made.  The film seems to be implying that it's all right for a person with incorrigible anti-social tendencies to rape and steal and murder if the ""Ludovico Technique"" is the only alternative.  Kubrick really wants us to think that Alex (Malcolm McDowell) is a cool guy.  First, we have the chummy, confidential narration, spoken by Alex himself.  Then the director distances us from the rapes, beatings and brawls perpetrated by Alex and his buddies by setting them to jolly Rossini and Beethoven.  He then dehumanizes Alex's victims by making them even more vicious and disgusting than he.  Figures of authority are either pathetic, grotesque cartoons (Alex's parents) or sadistic repressed homosexuals (Alex's correctional officer).  The movie does raise the important question of just how far a government should go in attempting to reform career criminals, but since cocky Alex does volunteer for the treatment in order to get a reduction of his prison sentence, no one can say that he doesn't know what he's in for. However, Kubrick means for us to cheer at the end when our ""hero"" is able to return to his old sociopathic self.  Somehow, I didn't feel like joining in the chorus."

","A Clockwork Orange is a Violent, Dark, Twisted, Sick, Eye Popping, Disrespectful Film....and I loved it.  It might actually be one of the most controversial films in the 20th Century.  The director of A Clockwork Orange, Stanley Kubrick had the most twisted mind in making this film, but not only was he twisted but the author of the original novel had some part in the distorted visions or beliefs of Alex and his ""droogs"".  I loved this movie because it was different.  I also found it a little humorous when Alex did some of the things that he did in the film.

Watching ""Clockwork"" was seeing film history made. I think that Kubrick, in his own way, was the Quentin Tarantino of his time. Pushing the envelope constantly. The script and scenes tie together extremely well, as does the ""Ludwig van"" portions. The characters are well developed, and there can never be too many hot women in any movie. Superiorly original concept by the author Burgess, but putting it on screen is entirely a different ballpark. I couldn't wait to see it again.

"susanita912","10","1","2","18 March 2002"," A Clockwork Dilemma
","It's a proven fact that when you read a book, and then watch a movie based on it, you'll often feel disappointed of the result. This is a fairly general rule, and I've experienced those results many times. But there's something definitely different about this one. I'm not saying that the general rule applies here, but I'm not saying it doesn't either. I think that the best way to understand this is to consider both the movie and the book as two separate entities, and not one being the result of the other.<br/><br/>In this case, the movie was excellent. The disorientation, the violence, the anguish, the existential void were all displayed beautifully and almost poetically by Kubrick. Burgess achieved the same level of greatness with the book, but we have to understand as a group of somewhat intelligent people that books and films are two completely different means of expressing art. Books are interpretative, films are almost absolute. Books require more imaginative drive from the reader than movies from the spectator. With books you have to look within yourself and find an image of how you think the main character (in this case, Alex) would look like, in the movie, the director already made that decision for you.<br/><br/>There are also substantial differences as to how the message will get across. Burgess relies on direct language and action driven chapters, Kubrick lets the photography and the imagery speak for itself. I'm an admirer of Kubrick's films, and I can't say that I've ever been disappointed in his interpretations. In this case, I haven't really resolved the whole ""which one is better: the film or the book"" dilemma, mostly because even though the film is based on the book, and has the same characters, the same lines of dialogue, and the same setting, they both say two different things. Certainly the exclusion of that last chapter of the book from the movie created a new message to say, and reflected a new society to which the message was addressed to. Furthermore, it generated two different perspectives to read the book or watch the movie from: an optimistic one, and a decadent one.<br/><br/>Again, I have not yet solved this internal dilemma. But for whatever's worth, you should definitely watch the movie first, and then read the book. Just in case you don't think like me."
"AdFin","10","1","2","7 February 2002"," ""As I slooshied, I knew such lovely pictures""
","It's got to be handed to Kubrick; no other director can be cited as making so many back-to-back classics in his working career.  His ability to move seamlessly from genre to genre, still covering the themes of man's metamorphosis, his place in the universe and his desire to choose between right and wrong, is something some filmmakers never manage.  If his previous film 2001: A Space Odyssey was his attempt to look at man's place in existence, the surely A Clockwork Orange is a look at man's place in society, not in any Ken Loach, lower class, upper class rivalry way, but in how man functions in society.  The question raised by Kubrick and writer Anthony Burgess is `if man cannot freely choose between right or wrong does he cease to be a man?'  Kubrick and Burgess seem to be in agreement, yes! But whereas Burgess' novel showed us that, given time, the person will soon grow-up and decide for themselves, once and for all, what path to choose in life.  But because Kubrick missed the last chapter of the book, the film takes on an entirely different agenda. <br/><br/>The year is now 2002, we have sailed through the year that Kubrick made famous with his watershed sci-fi picture, and we stand looking out at an uncertain future, and one thing that stands out, is the shocking similarities between the fantasy of A Clockwork Orange, and the reality of the everyday world.  Hooligans are everywhere, teenage louts that have elderly people too terrified to leave their homes after dark, our countries are run by lying, back-stabbing politicians who are always out for their own gain, and now scientists are looking into new treatments for the correction and rehabilitation of violent offenders.  It's not hard to see the pompous politicians of A Clockwork Orange and not subliminally think of Jack Straw or Tony Blair stood at the podium.  And this is the talent of Stanley Kubrick, his ability to build lasting images through his own visual sense. Everything about his movies takes on a certain iconography, they not only represent the style of the times they where made and simultaneously dictate the style of when they are set, I mean, who wasn't just a bit let down by the year 2001's less than glorious look in comparison to Kubrick's vision, in the same way we are perturbed by A Clockwork Orange's dilapidated future. <br/><br/>Kubrick turns Burgess' themes into a full scale plan of attack, complimenting his message by utilizing all the camera and editing effects that went into the grandeur of 2001, but simplifying them to conform to both the idea of A Clockwork Orange, and the film's limited budget.  The use of slow-motion and ultra-speed works well, even if the laughable high-speed sex orgy looks like a throw back to the days of Benny Hill, and some people have trouble with the use of back projection and process shots, but all of these help build the world of the film, and help dictate the skewed perception of Alex (McDowell).  Both the character of Alex and the way in which McDowell portrays him is unbelievably complex, guiding the audience through this world with his narration, he makes the audience one of his `droogs' which means that we like Alex right from the start, his actions may appal us, but at this stage he's our only ally.  This is another one of Kubrick's trump cards, because if we like Alex, then we will feel for him as his victims take their revenge, and that's when the film has you, when you start to feel sympathy for this amoral character.<br/><br/>`What's it going to be then?' is the future of A Clockwork Orange almost upon us, is Kubrick such a master film-maker that his films have the ability to predict time? Well, since none of us are now actually revolving in a space station to the haunting echo of `The Blue Danube' I would say no.  But it is impossible to watch the images of restrained violence and political corruption of A Clockwork Orange and not be drawn in, and more importantly not you leave feeling overwhelmed by the attention to detail and iconic, haunting images that Kubrick shows us.  Pop-art fantasy, or harsh political indictment, you decide.  10/10"
"The Doctor-2","10","1","2","24 January 2002"," One of Kubrick's best
","From the cold, haunting, electronic opening theme of A Clockwork Orange (written and directed by Stanely Kubrick), you can tell immediately that this will be a very unsettling film.  Alex's (played by Malcolm McDowell) leering stare into the camera, as it slowly zooms away, is very menacing, and you can tell instantly that this isn't a fellow to be messed with! Through the narration, he tells you of his gang or his droogs as he calls them, and his fondness for something called 'ultra-violence'.   We then come to the first scene, where he and his gang savagely beat up a defenceless old drunkard.  Then they get into a fight with another gang, which is played to classical musical, but strangely enough, it seems to fit in perfectly with the violence on screen,  which I think is part of Stanely Kubrick's skill as a director.  After that, they steal a car, and go joy riding down a country lane, with little regard at all to any other people on the road.  They then come to a quiet house, owned by a writer and his wife, which they have chosen for what Alex calls, 'Surprise visit'.  What this surprise visit consists of is forcing their way into the house, trashing up there home, and in between beating up the writer, raping his wife in front of him, Alex cheerfully sings, 'Singin'' in the Rain'.  It's such a horrible, disconcerting, violent scene that it's really very difficult to watch, and all this happens in the first few opening scenes!  But it isn't as bleak as this the whole way through.  There are some nice, comical touches to it, such as Alex's slimy parole officer, who at the end of every sentences says, `Yes?', and tries on several occasions to touch Alex up.  Also, when Alex eventually goes to prison for killing a lady, the warden (played by Michael Bates) seems as if he's stepped straight out of the set of 'Porridge', as he's very similar Mr. MacKay, albeit he swears a whole lot more!  There's also the prison priest, who's a rather amusing character, too.  However, the most complicated character in the whole film is Alex.  Although he has committed some awful crimes, for some reason, and I think this is partly down to Malcolm MacDowell's acting, and Stanely Kubrick's direction, you not only feel sorry for him, but you identify and sympathise with him.  Alex is, essentially, still a child, as he lives with his parents, and goes to school.  Also, when he's told that one of his victims is now dead, he's speechless, almost as if it's never occurred to him that somebody could die from his actions.   He keeps a pet too, a snake called Basil, which although is an usual animal to have, it does show that he has a sensitive side. Also, there is a far darker side to his personality, too.  When he reads the Bible, he fantasies about torturing Jesus, and leading many of the battles that happened in the Old Testemant, but has an angelic look on his face while reading it, making the priest think he's had some sort of religious enlightenment!   The main thing that you wonder when watching this film is what kind of society created Alex, and during his time in prison, that question is answered.  The government is clearly a near  state totalitarian state, and consider Alex to be a petty criminal, more concerned about political prisoners.   When Alex undergoes the Ludovico treatment, where he's forced to watch violent images of murders, rapes, and even footage from concentration camps, all to the music of Bethoven, in order to make him a 'better person'.  However, as the priest says, he has no choice on whether to be good or not, and that's essentially what makes us human.  Without the choice, we cease to be human beings, which is one of the many deep themes of the film.  Also, we get the impression that Alex has been through all this before, as his prohibition officer hints that he's been in trouble before, and at the end of the film, it appears that he's back to his old self again. In short, I think A Clockwork Orange is possibly one of Stanely Kubrick's greatest films, and is also one of the best films ever made.  It's a dark, twisted masterpiece of cinema.  It's a bit heavy going, but it's well worth watching!"

We must preserve our right to free expression and trust in the people to make the appropriate determination as to the legitimacy of the work.

","Alex DeLarge(Malcolm McDowell) is a hoodlum in not-too-distant future London. As the tagline says, ""His principal interests are rape, ultraviolence and Beethoven. He and his ""droogs""(friends) often spend a lot of time away from home and out on the streets. They go out at night and have fun which means getting into fights with other gangs, commit random acts of violence, and ""in-out""(rape) women. One night, when Alex comes out of some lady's house after beating her to death with a large statue, he is beaten up and betrayed by his droogs and is left to be arrested by the police. At the jail, Alex is informed that a woman that he had performed an ""in-out"" on had died at the hospital from her injuries. Alex is then sent to prison. While there, he reads the Bible(he only reads about the sex and violence) and dreams of getting out of prison. He then asks a preacher about an experiment that he had heard about at Ludovico that if successful, could possibly rid him of any violent or sexual impulses he might have. Soon enough he is sent to Ludovico. There he is forced to watch unedited footage of brutal beatings, rapes, and Nazi marches all the while with good old Ludwig van Beethoven's Ninth Symphony playing in the background. Alex comes out of Ludovico a changed man or is he?<br/><br/>This is actually the second film directed by the late Stanley Kubrick that I've watched with ""Full Metal Jacket"" being the first. Malcolm McDowell is truly awesome in his role as the sadistic, young Alex. Stanley Kubrick said he wouldn't been able to make this movie without him. Stanley Kubrick did take an awfully big chance with this movie. The violence here in ""A Clockwork Orange"" can simply be described as ultra. There are many brutal rape scenes and several bloody beatings. People who like Gene Kelly's ""Singing in the Rain"" may not like it anymore if they watch ""A Clockwork Orange"" because Malcolm McDowell sings it while kicking the crap out of an elderly man and raping his wife.<br/><br/>The musical score is the easily one of the best parts of ""A Clockwork Orange"". It is fantastic! The opening score is the one I like the most. The way it plays while Alex is looking into the camera with that half-smile, you wonder what exactly is going through his head at that moment. The ""milk bar"" or whatever it's called that Alex and his droogs are sitting at, is unique and yet ultimately frightening and disturbing at the same time.<br/><br/>The film's setting is apparently futuristic London, but it seems a lot like present day London. The reason it feels so much like present day is because of the clothing and all the cars and stuff like that. This feels a lot more like some sort of dark, comic satire than it does a science-fiction movie.<br/><br/>""A Clockwork Orange"" certainly is a twisted work of art. It is now my favorite Stanley Kubrick film. As I said before Stanley Kubrick did take a chance making this movie. It probably could of either made or ended his career because of all the sex and violence that's in this movie.<br/><br/>""A Clockwork Orange"" gets a 10/10"
"sabotage989","10","1","2","8 November 2001"," A Clockwork Orange Analysis
","-!!SPOILER ALERT!!-<br/><br/>A Clockwork Orange is definitely one of Stanley Kubrick's finest films. With the combination of Anthony Burgess' mind-twisting story and Kubrick's film genius, the film was destined for greatness. The graphic sex scenes and ultraviolence means that only mature viewers should see this movie, or those who can understand the true meaning behind the film. The novel was written as a warning against totalitarianism that Burgess believed was taking root in England, perhaps after having read of Ingsoc in George Orwell's ""1984"". This is introduced in the book by Alex's first victim, the drunk in the tunnel. (""Its no world for an old man any longer. Men on the moon, and men spinning around the earth like it might be midges round a lamp, and no attention payed to earthly law nor order no more."") Alex thrives in this society, until he has to reap the consequences of what he has done. Then, he attempts to find the easy way out and ends up in more trouble. As Mario Falsetto said in his book ""Stanley Kubrick: A Narrative and Stylistic Analysis"" the irony is that the Ludovico Treatment would work if society itself were not inherently vicious.<br/><br/>Kubrick's genius with film presents these complicated ideas wonderfully. During the Thames Embankment scene, two slow zooms, one into Alex's face and the other into the water, give the effect of Alex's depressed state beautifully. The use of wide-angle lenses at extreme angles, such as when F. Alexander realizes that Alex is the one who raped and murdered his wife, give a very disturbing effect indeed. Kubrick also uses POV shot/reverse shot sequences to give the viewer a sense that Alex is the one not only narrating the story, but living it as well. Many of the scenes in the movie are seen from Alex's perspective.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie is a very thought-provoking essay on human nature and human imperfection. Although some may denounce it as raising violence onto a pedestal, I believe that if you pay careful attention to the movie the tone is not one of anarchism. It is more of a somber realization that although violence is a terrible thing, the fascistic means that the Government used to get rid of it were worse. This is evidenced by when the Minister of the Interior is showing Alex off to see the effects of the Ludovico Treatment, he begins speaking like a droog. (""Enough of words, actions speak louder than. Action now, observe all."") The Government has become the thug. The real issue of the film is: is it better to be an evil human than to be good and not be a human at all, only a ""clockwork orange""?"

","Mild SPOILERS<br/><br/>A Clockwork Orange is one of the most important documents of violence produced in the last fifty years. Never has a film divided opinions, enraged debates, and caused such moral outrage than this 1971 masterpiece. What else is there to say about the story and cult status of this film, probably very little, but what I really want to make light of with this film is the power it still retains thirty years after it's release. ""If man cannot choose between good and evil does he cease to be a man"" - that is the main argument of A Clockwork Orange, and that is the question that little Alex (Malcolm McDowell) must confront, as his own violence places him in prison. The film also looks at the troubles of teenage violence, who's to blame, society, the parents, the education system - the film says so much about the state of Britain in the 1970's, and with the growing boom in punk culture that would follow in the later part of the decade and the race riots and work strikes that would populate the early eighties, it's influence lived on.<br/><br/>
Kubrick was never a director afraid to take a risk, this was his follow up to 2001: a space odyssey (1968), it cost a mere $2 million dollars, how many directors can claim to make a risk like that, very few that I can think of. Which makes it all the more surprising whilst watching A Clockwork orange, with the fact that Kubrick was a man of his forties when he made the film, yet he has such an understanding of his young characters, he puts us with the evil droogs and still manages to make us care something for them. This was of course the problem with the film. Kubrick making us feel empathy for these amoral characters made the film one of the most controversial ever made (in Britain mainly) it seamed to be a culmination of all the problems that seemed to be around at the time - of course, as we all know now - Kubrick withdrew it.<br/><br/>Flash forward to 2001, and how does this film hold up... Well there are many scenes that appear dated, but they also work with the disorientating look of the film, the cold atmosphere that followed all of Kubrick's films, the slightly dangerous detachment that the viewer is forced to undergo (the rape of Mrs Alexander for instance must be one of the hardest scene's to watch), not for graphic depiction, we see very little of the action, but for how Kubrick shoots the film, the iconography, the lighting, the forced perspectives the camera takes, everything is purposely set up to achieve a certain reaction from the viewer. Also, but this mainly comes form Anthony Burgess' novel, but the two act structure carries the film excellently. Kubrick would also employ this to great effect in Full Metal Jacket (1987)... But with A Clockwork Orange it really drives the message home.<br/><br/>
The first half is a joyously fast forty minutes, cut to a frantic, almost non-stop music score. The second half, much slower, much more silent, as if Kubrick is showing us what kind of pain Alex is going through, even if his character hides it under charm and constant exuberance. I would definitely rank this as one of the best film ever made, it certainly takes multiple viewing for the full power of the film to be revealed, to break deep into the meanings and issues the film explores, way too much to even begin to touch upon here. Oddly enough in these modern days, the scariest thing about A Clockwork Orange is nothing that stems from the screen, but the growing notion that we are closer to the reality of Alex with every day...<br/><br/>Viddy well little brother, Viddy Well!<br/><br/>10/10"

It wasn't even just the plot that got to me; somehow, the techniques Kubrick used to shoot it & the dialogue made my skin crawl too. One of the worst things is when they kill the lady with a giant replica of a penis. I think that they also kill a couple in front of each other, but I'm not sure about that b/c it's been so long. Anyway, it goes way too far, way beyond the boundaries of good taste. Kubrick should have known better. I believe in free speech, but this is a load of trash, & America is better off without it.

","""A Clockwork Orange"" is an early film by famed director Stanley Kubrick about a distant future where bands of vicious criminals roamed the night. We meet Alex, a young boy, who, with his three friends beat innocent elderly people for their sick kicks. However, one night, an attack went terribly awry. While his droogs escaped, Alex was captured by the ""rozz"" (police) and sent to the ""Staja"" (state prison). While there, he discovers an experimental procedure that could get him out of prison in two weeks. However, he was ill-prepared for what horrors awaited him. He sits in a dental chair in the center of a simulated while his body is strapped down, eliminating any movement. His eyelids are forced open, so he has to keep utmost attention to the gruesome images he is shown on the screen. After 14 excruciating days, Alex is deemed cured. The media hails him as a success, although Alex's sanity is beginning to deteriorate. He goes back home, but his parents are convinced he escaped, so they refuse to let him in. Through the movie, Alex frantically tries to find some salvation from society. Eventually, he returns to his original state of mind, but vows not to return to his criminal behaviors of the past.<br/><br/>Before I get into the actual review, I must admit that I am not a huge fan of Kubrick. I think his movies are somewhat overrated, considering most of them are based on books, including ""Clockwork"". Maybe he was a revolutionary in his time, but now there are plenty of quote-unquote ""weird"" directors, so I'm not that impressed with him. ""Clockwork"" was no exception. If you didn't know, the movie is based upon the '60s novel by Anthony Burgess. His novel, if you can imagine, was actually MORE controversial than the movie and was banned in several countries. It was also better than the movie. It's not that I think ""Clockwork was a bad movie, it's just that it bears too many similarities to the book. With the source material Kubrick was given, he should've made a much better movie than this. He and this movie get far too much credit. Almost everything was taken word-for-word from the book. Instead of interpreting it in his own way, he interpreted as it Burgess did, which I dislike in movie-book adaptations. So, basically, what I'm saying is: If you're a fan of the movie, do yourself a favor and read the book, then see how much respect you have for the movie.<br/><br/>** 1/2 out of ****"

Kubrick wanted things to be PERFECT in all his films because that was the auteur he was.

"jmarlinbarker","10","1","2","8 April 2001"," Sheer brilliance
","For anyone who has not seen A Clockwork Orange, it is only fair to point out that the director, Stanley Kubrick, perhaps unwittingly made the U.S. version of Anthony Burgess' novel into film. Burgess seemed jaded that a significantly different ending was cut from his own intended version which for a while could only be found in the U.K.<br/><br/>Aside from the controversy of whether or not the film genuinely relays Burgess' own ideas, I think the film is so brilliant that there is something noteworthy to be observed with each subsequent viewing. It never loses its thunder. I have known a few people to get offended by the violence, but the film does have a sharp sense of satire and even slapstick. The ugliness arguably just mirrors the human condition--in which men ""have been on the moon,"" yet have not conquered brutality on the streets or in the government for that matter."

","There never is, never was, or never will be a film like A Clockwork Orange. This film is so ahead of its time I can't even imagine what people thought about in 1971 let alone 2001. It is a dizzying array of violence, black humour and special camera shots that sets this movie apart. There might have been imitators to this film and Pulp Fiction is definitely influenced by this film but there is no film like this one. Kubrick is brilliant with all the special camera angles, editing and whatever else he does. Malcolm McDowell is fantastic as Alex the troubled youth who gets brainwashed for his own good and suffers the consequences. And Beethoven's music is the perfect score for this film. So many memorable scenes I don't know where to begin. It has also influenced me in how I view the world through ""innocent eyes."" Its in my top five in best movies of all time."
"DavidPumpkins","10","1","2","15 February 2001"," One of the treasures of the cinema
","There aren't many films I would praise as highly as I could ""A Clockwork Orange"", the select few would be the likes of ""The Shawshank Redemption"" (1994); ""It's A Wonderful Life"" (1946) and Kubrick's marginally (very marginally, I might add) better ""Dr. Strangelove Or: How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Love The Bomb"" (1964).  Of course ""A Clockwork Orange"" has its critics - indeed, what film doesn't? - but none of these narrow-minded individuals can prevent me from appreciating the film.  A grim vision of the future sees young Alex (a career-best performance from Malcolm MacDowell) and his band of 'droogs' (there are a lot of post-modern slang words used in the film, by the way) who spend every evening beating, raping and pillaging innocent people for their own amusement.  In 1971, the film understandably caused outrage for its graphic violence and sexual scenes but by modern standards they are what cinema-goers have come to expect.  Alex is arrested and the film centres on his rehabilitation in prison and how he volunteers for a revolutionary new treatment aimed at wiping out crime.<br/><br/>A hugely important film, it most likely paved the way for the more tolerant censorship of today, as violence on-screen became gradually more accepted. <br/><br/>
Being a UK resident, I had to wait a while before being able to legally see the film, Kubrick infamously pulled the film from UK Cinemas amidst fears of copycat violence and proclaimed it could not be released until after he went to that great editing suite in the sky, which he lamentably did in 1999. <br/><br/>
One of the greatest cinematic achievements, don't be put off by the film's unsavoury reputation, it's not nearly as horrifying as you might think.  The chilling question the film provokes is just how far are we now from the future Kubrick envisioned?<br/><br/>One thing goes without question - Stanley Kubrick is the best director bar none."

","I thought that Anthony Burgess' ""Clockwork Orange"" was one of the most brilliant and disturbing books I've ever read, so I was very eager to see Stanley Kubrick's cinematic take. Sadly, while I thought that the film was worth a look in the end I was underwhelmed. It's very well made, as befits a Kubrick film, with great eye for composition, camera shots, etc., and it boasts a fantastic central performance from Malcolm McDowell as Alex, although he's obviously too old to play a 14-year-old. But any message the film was trying to convey was completely lost in ridiculous lurid production design that I found shockingly dated. You don't need to have seen Austin Powers movies to giggle at the 70s fashions gone barking mad. The film's ""ultra-violent"" tag looks just as hopelessly dated. I'm not desensitised to screen violence and rape, but here it just looks cartoonish and frankly ridiculous; therefore I felt there was no real impact to Alex's crimes. It also doesn't help that Alex is made to be the only character who seems alive and vibrant amongst the unlikeable, personality-free drones. Oh, and did I mention that practically everyone overacts like there's no tomorrow? In the end, the film IMO is nothing more than a curious relic."

","In my opinion, A Clockwork Orange is Kubrick's best film, and may be the best film of all time.  The opening shot that tracks backward from a close-up of Alex is only rivaled by the opening shot of A Touch of Evil. Kubrick takes the use of color to new heights, constantly using orange and blues (a color scheme he returned to in Eyes Wide Shut).  Certain images from the movie are ingrained in my mind--such as the close-up of the handicapped writer's face while he is going insane.<br/><br/>The movie successfully addresses so many issues that are pertinent to society, including the nature of the criminal mind, retribution, and political exploitation.  However, I think that the central theme is the role of free will and is exemplified by the argument made by the prison chaplain after Alex has undergone the treatment--Is he really human if he has no free will to make a decision?  Kubrick would argue that he is half-human, half-machine, as the title of the movie indicates (Clockwork referring to a machine and orange referring to the organic, living fruit).<br/><br/>Finally, how could you write about this movie and not mention the music--the beautiful works of ""Ludwig van"" often serving as a wonderful contrast to the violent images on the screen.  The music adds to Alex's character so much--how many ""droogs"" would you expect to listen to Beethoven?  A Clockwork Orange succeeds at every level, and it would be impossible to ever analyze it completely."

As an American, I value my freedom, and this film shows just how fragile that freedom really is, for as seen in today's (everyday's), headlines there are those who, take away all that we hold dear, and get by with it.  The idea of a ""free, safe"" environment is an oxymoron, and yet to strive for anything less, is un-American.  The film asks the question ""Is there rehabilitation, for rapists and murderers""?  See this film, and decide for yourself.  A brilliant movie!!!! 10 out of 10"

","From what I heard of this film it was going to be very violent. I found that it wasn't as violent as people claimed it to be.  Maybe I didn't find it as violent because I've seen so many violent movies.  One thing I found different was that this movie showed killing as an art.  It also had nice little musical numbers like Alex singing ""singing in the rain"".  Another thing a found neat in this movie were the words Alex and his friends used giving you a bit more reason to pay closer attention to what they say in this. There are still some words I don't know the meaning of .  He used odd words like Guliver and Yarbles.  Anyway I can see why this won a few Acadamy awards.  Also I found that Malcom gave a very convincing performance of getting physically sick when he was exposed to anything that is considered wrong."
"Insincere Dave","10","1","2","5 April 2000"," Sociologist's nightmare, film-buff's dream.
","I must admit that I am not Stanley Kubrick's greatest fan - I found Eyes Wide Shut disappointing and 2001 just plain dull. However, I went to see A Clockwork Orange not only on account of the hype but also as I had read the book several years previously and I wanted to see if the film version lived up to the literary classic. I discovered, not to my surprise, that it is affected by 'The Exorcist' syndrome. Kubrick managed to create something totally different to its source material, yet with a charm of its very own.<br/><br/>Obviously, from the very outset, a very seventies film, this was unlike anything I have experienced at the cinema before. This film disturbs at almost every conceivable level - rape, murder, brainwashing and ""ultra-violence"" are all breezed over during this films run time. And does the film stop to moralise? It barely takes a breath, leaving ethics up to the audience's discussions on their way home. You leave the cinema wondering who - if anybody - you should feel sorry for. Everyone in the film, from Alex (Malcolm McDowell) to Dim (a very early performance from Warren Clarke) and from Mr. Deltoid (Aubrey Morris) to Mrs. DeLarge (Sheila Raynor) displays inhuman characteristics.<br/><br/>There seems to be some confusion as to whether this film is really about Alex and his violent nature, reflecting the darker side of human nature, or society having no qualms about using a victim to their own ends. Perhaps it was too many people believing the former which led to its retraction in Britain for more than 20 years. Either way, the dark undertones, superb soundtrack and excellent acting make this film a must-see for any self-respecting film fan. Kubrick-lover or not."

","This film, withheld for 30 years in Britain, and banned in Ireland, is finally rereleased, and five things are immediately apparent:<br/><br/>* That this is, as always with Kubrick, a stunningly beautiful film, with the stylised, futuristic, predominantly white set design clashing crucially with the very real, grim, abandoned 70s Britain, looking more post-apocalyptic than anything Kubrick could imagine;<br/><br/>* That the film is absolutely hilarious, for childish reasons, as caricature, as alarmingly prescient satire in this era of New Labour;<br/><br/>* That the film's 'ethical' difficulties arise from a Hitchcockian engagement with point-of-view, which points the blame on passive viewing (and, by extension our (non)engagement with society);<br/><br/>* That the film is gleefully homoerotic - check out the sly imagery in the warehouse fight scene between the two rival gangs;<br/><br/>* And that A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, for all its thrilling rush, and for all its showing up of our cowardly generations' cinema, is not a Kubrick masterpiece: whether the ironies are too broad, or the structure is too schematic, I don't know, but, unlike THE SHINING or BARRY LYNDON, Kubrick's major achievements, it just doesn't breathe.

","I will never forget the first time I watched this one. I felt quite numb afterwards. This is, after all, Kubrick's most controversial film, originally rated X for its candid, uncompromising scenes of rape and violence. <br/><br/>The part that stands out the most is the infamous ""Singin' in the Rain"" bit. Yes, THAT scene. I had to rewind the tape to make sure I actually saw THAT!!! I also love the scene with the ""cat lady"". An extremely powerful, nightmarish setpiece, it lingers in your mind forever afterward. The opening shot is one of the best in cinematic history, effectively establishing an eerie, menacing tone for what follows. <br/><br/>Malcolm McDowell is great here. This is the one he'll be remembered for decades from now. He deserved an Oscar, but the people who give these awards are just too timid. If I were in charge, I'd give it Best Picture, Director, etc. Come to think of it, it's surprising it was nominated for anything at all. (On the other hand, those New York critics were remarkably forward-thinking!)<br/><br/>Even after nearly thirty years, its power has not diminished. Believe me, I know. Judging from the comments posted, even some 21st-century viewers will still condemn the film the same way conservatives did in the 1970's.

Beautifully put together and brilliantly written, acted, and most of all directed.  The screenplay is disturbing and funny at the same time.  During the raping at the beginning, it is disturbing to watch, however, the singing of ""Singing In The Rain"" adds a little comedy to this upsetting scene.  Also funny is some of the dialogue.  My favorite quotes: ""No time for the old in-out love, just came to read the meter"" and ""Eggiwegs, I'd like...to smash them.""  Simply put, brilliant."

","""A Clockwork Orange"" can be the scariest film you've ever seen, because one day our society may end up like the one seen in the film--a place where ordinary people are afraid to walk outside even in the daytime, where innocent young women can be taken from the streets and raped, where the government itself doesn't seem the perfect solution. Sound familiar? Perhaps in twenty years, you'll be staring into the blue eyes of Alex while he asks you in his Nadsat slang if you value your life.<br/><br/>Possibly Stanley Kubrick's best film after ""2001""--but who can put Kubrick's films into any particular ranking when they're all so excellent? ""A Clockwork Orange"" is not a ""cool"" film in any sense. It's not sick or offensive or bad. It's a social commentary on life, and the book on which the film is based is even better--though the film is perfect because of its visual look of the near future. ""A Clockwork Orange"" is already a cult classic--and future generations will watch it and hopefully learn from it."

","A couple months ago, a Stanley Kubrick film festival was on TCM, so I decided to tape his movies-me being a great fan of him.  The first one I watched happened to be A Clockwork Orange, and I immediately became a fan. Granted, this movie is certainly not for everyone (especially the faint of heart), but everything in the movie is highly notable, including the direction, performances, camera views, music, script, and the novel it was based on. The movie begins with the adventures and times of Alex DeLarge, a vicious teenage monster, and his three droogs: Pete, Georgie, and Dim.  His main interests are Beethoven, rape, and ultraviolence (especially the old surprise visit).  On one unfortunate outing, the millicents (police) catch him as the rest of his gang flees.  He's thrown in staja (State Jail), but soon sees an opportunity for early release if he consents to be a test subject for a new technique for treating criminals.  He does, and is virtually reduced to a machine, or 'clockwork orange'.  He is robbed of his ability to choose, and in turn ceases to be a man.  There's quite a bit more of a twist near the end of the movie, so I won't spoil it for you.<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to anyone over 18, any movie buffs, aspiring filmmakers, or Kubrick fans.  Along with Full Metal Jacket, I think this is his best work."
"Cygnus X","10","1","2","18 August 1999"," My favourite Kubrick
","Based on Anthony Burgess' excellent novel, A Clockwork Orange is a masterpiece. A dark vision of the future, with ultra-violent youth ruling the streets and people being afraid to leave their houses after dark. Alex, a leader of such a gang gets caught after committing an ""accidental"" murder, and after two years of prison sentence, he is chosen to be reformed by a new method called Ludovico's technique, which is claimed to turn bad people into good people.<br/><br/>I think every director runs a risk when adapting a great novel, but the way Stanley Kubrick did it seems to be THE way. He kept the best scenes of the story, created a semi-dreamlike visual environment, added an terrific soundtrack, chose the suitable actors (nearly everybody who had more than two lines was memorable), and ran the whole thing with his usual precision. The only weaker point was the sex scene between Alex and the two devotchkas from the record store (but it would be a bit difficult to adopt the violent scene from the book with Alex of 15 and the girls like 10).<br/><br/>I don't know which movie should I consider as Kubrick's best, but this one is definitely my favourite. The first time I saw it, I just couldn't believe the soundtrack. Though it owes much to the novel, it transcends to an audio/visual experience only a movie can give you. I think Kubrick made the right decision which scenes to include. I'm glad he completely omitted the last chapter of the book. Also, this films features probably the most menacing last line in movie history.<br/><br/>Finally, there seems to be a common misunderstanding: many people seem to think that Ludovico's technique turned Alex into a good person, as promised. Wrong. Alex' body was conditioned to react to violence with sickness, but our humble narrator's personality hardly changed at all."
"No,Dave","10","1","2","28 July 1999"," Up with Dr. Strangelove
","Oh, what a great flick this is! Confrontational, ultraviolent, a stark realisation of how Burgess envisaged the future - random violence, liberalism gone hard, your choices made for you, the parent as the child. Is Alex the man-child that was last seen staring at you in the last 2 minutes of 2001? If so, we've definitely taken a step backwards, the dusk of man as rational being. The treatment (which, I've heard, damaged McDowell's cornea) is scary - my girlfriend couldn't watch. The music intertwines beautifully with it all, and the attempted suicide scene makes you feel the crunch of bone on ground. The ending also makes you think: has he changed at all? Is he still the choiceless fool rendered a vegetable by the Ludovico treatment? Where does society go from here? This is, along with Dr. Strangelove, Kubrick's best."

","The title pretty much sums up the entire movie. Save yourself the trouble and just skip it and for petes sake, dont sell out just to make yourself look deep.<br/><br/>This film is a childish rendition of what it means to be human. The argument is that its better to have choice and make bad choices than to have none. Its not a new idea, and most humans tackle the question by 4th grade when they realize they can think for themselves... well at least, most do. Clearly many dont have the brain power to think that deep, well into adulthood, hence the high scores you see for this film. Somehow, the question of self is profound to them. Truth is they are simply unintelligible themselves.<br/><br/>So anyway, this subject has been tackled since the dawn of humankind even in religion itself. Its taught in sunday school and even cavemen probably talked about it. Its not new, not profound, not original and certainly not well told in this film. The claim to fame for this film is just its shock value and people who assume that this was shocking back in the 70s. It wasnt. History lesson. Violence back then was easily 3-4x higher than today. It was far more common and anyone with half a brain knew just how violent the world was by just going outside or by reading the paper. Of course most people didnt hence the surprise when they saw this trashy movie. It was basically like watching porn and let me tell you porn back then was equally graphic. I remember walking around the hotel lobby in Europe as a kid where they had porn magazines out in the open. Subjects like watersports and scat were normal so dont tell me people had not seen worse back in the day and mind many had seen the horrors of WW2 so again, this film was literally nothing in comparison.<br/><br/>Anyway, stop making excuses for this film. This movie is the brainchild of an immature mind and there is nothing more to say about it. Everything was childish from message and imagery to execution and dialog. Grow up already.

","Not only is this the greatest study of violence, it's perhaps the best film ever made, and it's certainly my favourite. <br/><br/>The 'nadsat' language invented by Anthony Burgess in his original book, is absolute genius. The Russian vocabulary used in the film like 'Droog' and 'Babushka' implies that Dystopian Britain has been taken over by the Russian communists, a great fear at the time. Subtle. Alex's and his droogs character design is also pure genius, and he goes down as my favourite villain in film. After watching the film a few times, you start using Nadsat in daily speak, and so did Malcolm McDowell in filming (he was doing a part for another film and used the words 'groodies' instead of 'breasts'). <br/><br/>The entire droogs, korova milk bar, and Nadsat thing is to serve as a satire for modern day gangs and trends; on the streets of London, they have their own fashion (like the Droogs 'height of fashion'), their own slang (all that 'init bruv' and 'swag' nonsense), and their own hang-out places with drug use (like the Korova Milk Bar serving milk, laced with Vellocet, Synthemesc and Drenchrum drugs). <br/><br/>No one has done this much creative and original stuff with language since Shakespeare, proving Burgess to be one of the best writers of the 20th century, and Kubrick to be possibly THE best filmmaker of the 20th century."

The fact the last chapter was left out, and several key pieces of the story, Such as Alex killing a man in jail, and the origin of the title, were left out really bothered me. It also bothered me how certain scenes were changed, and changing them added nothing to the movie. For example, in the movie when Alex fights with Georgie and Dim, it appears that it a complete sneak attack, when in the book Georgie and Dim are the ones that actually initiate the fight.

"dcmarkham","4","2","8","1 September 2002"," As great as it is, the movie's scenes of blatant depravity detracts what can be gained from viewing it
","As a true film buff, I can accept the fact that some of the greatest movies ever made can also be extremely difficult to watch -- whether from its content and/or the emotional response it generates.  Most movies like this usually receive my adolation and praise, even if it may take me time to recover from the first viewing<br/><br/>But in my opinion, A Clockwork Orange takes the grand prize as the most disturbing movie I've ever seen, and it does not get much easier with repeat viewing.  The movie's brilliance in directing and storytelling makes it impossible to dismiss critically, yet the film disturbs me to the core.  I would almost hope that I am not alone in this opinion -- to truly 'enjoy' this movie you'd have to be pretty damn callous to hideous imagery, especially when it comes to rape and excessive exploitation of the female body.<br/><br/>If there's one very big dislike I have against Stanley Kubrick, it is way in which he treats the naked female body onscreen.  It becomes impersonal, cold, devalued -- cheapened and readily exploitable.  Think of these examples -- A Clockwork Orange: 5 gangsters rip the clothes off and rape a young woman to a classical waltz; the milk bar with naked women statues and dispensers; Alex's daydream of being in Roman times; the high-speed menage-a-trois; the naked, stoic 'temptress' onstage approaching Alex; and the 'humorous' winter-wonderland end-scene slow-motion daydream of public exhibitionism.  That's just A Clockwork Orange.  Throw in the naked woman in the tub in The Shining, along with scenes totalling a full one-third of the running time of Eyes Wide Shut and you should have a pretty good idea of the devaluation of the female body I'm referring to.<br/><br/>I think of Spartacus, Full Metal Jacket, 2001, Dr. Strangelove, even Barry Lyndon, and I just want to praise Kubrick forever.  The man is a cinematic genius.  But, because of how adversely A Clockwork Orange affects me, I must dismiss it and can't recommend it to anyone.  The more sensitive you are to what you see onscreen, the more this movie will deeply, deeply disturb you. I've seen it three times now, my first time being over 12 years ago, and it's no easier to watch now than then.  And sadly, because it is so disturbing, I am deprived of enjoying the greatness that the movie really does contain.<br/><br/>I read the book by Anthony Burgess because the story is truly brilliant. I was surprised to find out that the book's final chapter was purposely left out of the film.  Also, I was surprised to find that the author disliked the film, as he alludes in the book's introduction.  He feels that ""A Clockwork Orange"" has become to him what ""The Nutcracker"" was to Tchaikovsky -- what he considers as one of his least important works has become his most famous and recognized.<br/><br/>Ever wonder what is meant by ""a clockwork orange""?  Mr. Burgess explains the metaphor in the book's introduction.  An orange is sweet, refreshing, and juicy -- fulfilling and delicious.  But it is organic and cannot provide this sweetness forever -- it will eventually expire and rot.  Man cannot make an organic object function like an inorganic object, or something man-made, or 'clockwork'.  The term 'clockwork orange' is therefore an oxymoron and a paradox -- it infers that man has converted something organic into a controllable, inorganic process.  The experiment Alex goes through, by robbing him of free-will, effectively creates 'clockwork oranges' out of human beings -- he is forced to be sweet, gentle, and moral all the time.<br/><br/>
Final thoughts: I am LDS (or 'Mormon'), and it's noteworthy to mention something about the beliefs of the LDS religion as it pertains to this concept...  It is believed that in pre-earth life, Lucifer proposed that everyone who comes to earth be forced to do good, so that everyone will be worthy to return to God's presence after death, therefore 'no souls will be lost' -- however, he wanted the credit for this plan.  Jesus wanted each person to have complete free-agency in order to learn from their own decisions, and he voluteered himself to be the one who must live a perfect life as THE example as well as be the atoning sacrifice -- and all glory go to God, not to himself.  To have mankind robbed of its free-agency is the Devil's original plan and ultimate goal.  So, the movie and the book asks this supreme question: What's more evil -- a person who focusses all his thoughts and energy and actions on doing bad, or forcing this person to only think and feel and do good?<br/><br/>My answer: Skip the movie and read the book -- it's a far more edifying experience.  And you also get to know what happens in the final chapter!"

"MartinHafer","7","3","15","7 December 2008"," I've reconsidered my previous review...
","WARNING: ONLY AN INSANE AND IRRESPONSIBLE PARENT WOULD LET THEIR KIDS SEE THIS FILM!! SERIOUSLY! <br/><br/>I originally gave this film a very low score but have reconsidered it after having read the Anthony Burgess novel and then seen the movie again. The Burgess novel is brilliant but necessarily violent given the subject matter. I still think that Stanley Kubrick really lost his way in this film because he increased the level of violence and especially nudity--making the film, at time, almost like a sex film. This was just gratuitous and seemed highly reminiscent of NATURAL BORN KILLERS--a film that was just too graphic and needlessly trivialized violence. However, despite Kubrick's overindulgence, the film is pretty good and reasonably close to the novel--and I appreciated this greatly. Plus, I liked Malcolm McDowell's nice performance.<br/><br/>First, let's talk about the overindulgence that keep me from seeing this as a brilliant film (despite popular opinion--after all, it's #49 on the IMDb top 250). The book never had such graphic rape scenes and that much sex. In Kubrick's vision, the story is more about sex than violence much of the time--completely missing the point of Burgess' novel. Adding rapes and making many of the scenes so very graphic just seemed unnecessary and make this an adults-only film that easily earned the X rating (today it clearly would be an NC-17 film). Plus, Kubrick's need for over-indulgence made the film seem more like a Ken Russell film--just unnecessarily crude with statues of Jesus with an erect penis, the character Alex beating to death a woman with a giant penis and testicles statue (the original way she dies in the book was much better--funny and ironic) and many, many scenes of graphic non-violent nudity that were not even in the book. Oddly, despite the many depravities, Kubrick chose not to include an attempt by one of Alex's roommates to sexually abuse him--an odd omission considering everything else.<br/><br/>Now if you can manage to watch the film and ignore how over the top it is compared to the book, you will be happy that most of the scenes in the book are still there (though, as I think, with a few unnecessary additions). Plus, much of the spirit of Burgess' excellent novel is present--along with Alex's clever narration. On the very positive side, the movie is based on the American version of the novel not the original British one (which is odd, as Kubrick loved the UK and didn't think much of his home country according to most reports). In the British version, there was a final unnecessary chapter in which, by Alex was in his early 20s and he was essentially cured--wanting to become a productive citizen practically overnight. While a redemption is possible, having it happen so young and so quickly with such a hard-core sociopath didn't make any sense at all and undid most of the book. Leaving Alex an unrepentant and vile individual had much greater impact.<br/><br/>By the way, it's never really said but I thought it was implied in both the book and film that after Alex's attempted suicide, doctors de-programmed him--possibly by employing psychosurgery or more conditioning techniques. I spoke to a friend who never noticed this--yet he LOVED the book. What did you think about Alex's transformation following this attempt? <br/><br/>Overall, a very good version of the Burgess book but also way too sexually explicit--limiting the movie's audience and possibly encouraging rape and violence instead of being a tale about totalitarianism and behavioral conditioning."

","To understand the human being, one has to understand the idea of freewill. Although it is difficult to determine whether or not free will exists, it is much simpler to analyze on how genuine a person can be, based on their own nature. Stanley Kubrick's dystopian satire plays on this concept of human individuality, pitting itself against a more mechanistic conception of the human being. A Clockwork Orange explores the subjects of morality, political institutions through manipulation, and the initial use of behavioral psychology in a story that plays out with a chaotic theme of destruction, mixed with comedy, and somewhat championing a psychotically charismatic protagonist. The young, and difficult to detest Alex (McDowell), our ""loving narrator,"" is both charming and witty in his many loves of life. Be it the beauty of battle among ""Droogs"" of a lesser caliber, his appetite for the ""old in out in out"", or the awe he experiences every time he plays Beethoven's the ninth. Alex, along with his fellow droogs walk the streets of London, beating the poor and further concocting more mayhem to enact on the innocent. After killing a gymnast with an erotic piece of art, Alex is sentenced to 14 years in prison. It doesn't take long for the young hoodlum to acquire even more enemies, be it the conservative prison Chaplin(Quigley) played with an amusing authoritarianism that further strengthens the satirical aspects of the film. After two years of faithfully reading the good book, Alex enlists in a government rehabilitation program with the potential to help him get out quickly. Little to his satisfaction comes the revelation as he faces and reviles at the very violence he once cherished worthy of the grace of God. One grotesque image after another is played out with the ninth in the background, thus deconstructing the very monster Alex is, by no means of himself, for the concept of choice is forsaken for simply greater ethics. It's hard to imagine that there are those who believe that the outcome is more important than the means generated, but as the Minister of the Interior (Sharp) proclaims his change of heart as the cure to evil, Alex's true purpose through the film becomes ever more clear. When first viewing this film, and its brutal rape scenes, accompanied by a jolly tone of wonder, the delusion that Alex merely serves as the role of a sociopath came to mind. As the film progressed however, the manipulation of his nature for political gains became one of the clearer messages within Alex's Cockney rhyming slang. The London society of the film although not completely desolate, is defined by chaos. The streets are filled with rampant gangs of violent sadists, crooked cops, and erotic artwork. Several of the criticisms towards the society in the film, have labeled it a Communist State, just after its failure to stand within the image of socialism. It isn't a far cry of an assumption, as equality appears to be absent within the setting, and it is much easier to see who is in charge. Regardless of who gets to Alex, be it the right wing Minister, with his compassionate generosity, or the self-righteous patriotism of the Anti-Totalitarian left, his place is that of a puppet. Regardless of his nature, or whatever bad luck he stumbles upon, Alex will always find someone to play the puppeteer of his life, never fully grasping the irony of his place in the very society that has robbed him of his right to choose. Although very brash in its approach towards the subject of political manipulation, behavioral psychology, and sexual violence, A Clock Work Orange is a bold, and liberating exercise in filmmaking. Written and Directed by Stanley Kubrick, the film Adaptation of Anthony Burgess' novella is brilliant in its approach of presenting morality within the scope of choice in opposition of psychological abuse. Although the protagonist, Alex is a genuine monster, one cannot completely hate him. Within the first fifteen minutes, he rapes a woman, while singing ""Singing in the Rain"", and yet it is through his rather calm and quaint narrations that he is able to charm his audience into further observing his story, wondering where his path of inner torture will lead him. Malcom McDowell in one of his first screen roles delivers a performance that is both malevolent and ecstatic in its execution. As the leader of his droogs, his pacing along with his patience comes the essence of a wacky and capricious trickster, who sooner tastes the perils of victimhood. Initially we are meant to sympathize with him as he is further thrown down a pit of despair. This same pit carries the many atrocities that he once more acquires, as he utters ""Yes I was cured"", but it all boils down to the true significance of his own purpose as a tool for political power, and not any genuine significance or meaning in his existence other than an addict of destruction and mayhem."

There are lots of graphic scenes of nudity, violence and rape, which rightfully elicit disgust. It's also the brash and raw nature of this film that makes it appealing. Either way, good or bad, if a film can impact someone, it has done it job. It's better to be hated than forgotten, and this is an unforgettable movie.<br/><br/>This sci-fi film is about topics such as morality, free will, proper criminal justice ethics and political corruption. Is the government's treatment of curing a sociopath by performing mental experiments on him immoral. While Kubrick effectively conveyed how horrific of a sociopath Alex was, I don't think he came even close to convincing the viewer that the cure was worse (or as gruesome) than the disease."
"RodrigAndrisan","10","1","3","15 April 2016"," One of my favorite films ever
","Together with Fellini, Sergio Leone and Milos Forman, Kubrick is one of my favorite film directors ever. Of course there are others that I love, such as Antonioni, Bergman, Bunuel, Kurosawa, Ken Russell, Tarkovsky, Pasolini, Vittorio De Sica. But back to the topic, not before reminding that Mr. Kubrick was of Romanian origin, like me... (with a small difference, he was born in New York City, Free World, me in Bucharest City, Communist Romania...) So, A Clockwork Orange: we can write a whole novel or even a short prose about it... I saw the film several times, in different periods of time. I translated the film many times, just as they talk in the movie, uncensored, at the Romanian Cinematheque in Bucharest. Every time it fascinates me and I transpose myself right there in the action, living the life of Alex DeLarge(Malcolm McDowell). It is a fascinating story of this character and I feel a strong connection with Antoine Doinel (Jean-Pierre Léaud)in Les quatre cents coups (The 400 Blows (1959) of François Truffaut (another favorite of mine). It is something of my life in these characters, I had a troubled childhood myself, therefore I found me in these characters. I also find myself in Beethoven and in the manner that Kubrick used his music to tell us the story of Anthony Burgess. I found myself also in the music by Wendy Carlos(as Walter Carlos). The image, editing, directing, scenery, everything is grade 10 plus in this film. They wrote a lot about it (this is the review number 1330) so I'll finish making mention on two of the actors, Malcolm McDowell and Patrick Magee. I saw and appreciated both in many films. I saw Malcolm McDowell in films such as Caligula, If...., O Lucky Man !, Time After Time, Aces High, The Raging Moon. By far, A Clockwork Orange is his best film. I saw Patrick Magee in Marat / Sade, Barry Lyndon, Telephon, Chariots of Fire, Cromwell, Hard Contract, Zulu, Dementia 13, The Servant. Mr. Alexander is his best role."

","I should probably be upset at this film. Beethoven's Scherzo (never mind Freude, schöner Götterfunken) is one of my favorites, and now almost every time I hear it, I think at least fleetingly of brutal sexual assault because the film immediately comes to mind. At least in 2001: A Space Odyssey the images that come to mind are of rotating space stations and trans-warp distortions.<br/><br/>Although its Russo-British the-world-has-gone-down-the-tubes is a bit dated, Clockwork is a compelling alternate universe. In the film, gangs of high school hoodlums whose parents barely pay attention to them kill, rape, and intimidate one another at night. The narrator, who's a smart and charismatic kid and might have turned out OK, is scary in his matter-of-fact narration of the story, which swiftly takes him into the hands of unscrupulous politicians as a guinea pig for a Pavlov-like conditioning to rehabilitate criminals on the double.<br/><br/>The film has many themes, but the theme of choice is inherent in all of them. Take away a person's ability to choose, and you cannot have true good or evil. <br/><br/>As a dystopia, the film fails to find any good in anyone, except perhaps its main character, and in the priest who calls out the question of choice. The parents are whining, inattentive cowards; the politicians are ... politicians; the nurses care more about sex than patients; the doctors are cold-blooded beasts; the police are as brutal as the criminals; even the liberal, whose wife died as a result of our anti-hero's rampages, yet who wants to help him find choice again, rejoices at the pain when he applies Beethoven saturation-training to undo the governmental conditioning.<br/><br/>Kubrick never made a bad film, or even a merely good film. This one is no exception. Perhaps I am giving it only an 8 because I'm ticked off a little every time I hear the Scherzo."
"Rickting","10","1","3","10 March 2015"," One of the most demented and fiendishly brilliant films ever made
","Stanley Kubrick, the perfectionist genius who no director will ever be able to copy, has made many great films. But nothing is quite as great as A Clockwork Orange. A sociopathic delinquent is put in prison and given controversial rehabilitation, which soon impacts negatively on his life. With themes and social commentary in every frame, ACO is a very deep and thought provoking movie. It's one of the most controversial films of all time. This is where the film shows its age, as some of its content seems slightly tame compared to modern cinema. However, ACO is a harrowing, terrifying and deliriously brilliant movie which is more gut wrenchingly frightening than any theme park attraction; not because of the violence, but because of the haunting themes and chilling relevance over 40 years after its release. It's not the easiest watch, but you will not be able to get it out of your head. From the opening shot, in which an excellent Malcolm McDowall gives you the Kubrick glare, you'll be utterly hooked.<br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick is at the absolute top of his form with ACO. Amazing cinematography, intelligent production design and a chilling, nightmarish atmosphere make this a complete knockout on the visual front. The writing is superb, and this mixes ultra violence and pitch black humour brilliantly, and the unflinching emotional power and haunting sense of tragedy further enhances the film. ACO is emotionally cold and very dark, so some viewers will not enjoy it. It may take more than one viewing to get it. The film has an authentic atmosphere but combines it with disturbing surrealism and the brilliant cinematography makes the film genuinely terrifying at times. While no easy ride, ACO is also a relevant, powerful and fascinating film which perhaps isn't enjoyable in the traditional sense but which will have you riveted and amazed at the sheer genius of the work. Stanley Kubrick's most controversial film but also his best, this makes 2001 A Space Odyssey look insignificant in comparison.<br/><br/>10/10"
"Red-Barracuda","10","1","3","25 July 2014"," Brilliant satire about a youth with a penchant for the old ultra-violence...
","A Clockwork Orange stands as easily the most controversial film Stanley Kubrick ever directed. It was released at a time in the early 70's when the Hollywood studios were systematically releasing a number of highly controversial, violent films such as Straw Dogs, Deliverance and Dirty Harry. It was withdrawn from public circulation by the director himself in the UK for 27 years, only becoming available again after his death. The reason for the self-imposed ban was the result of reports of some violent incidents where thugs appeared to be acting under the influence of the film itself and the Kubrick's themselves even received death threats too. It really was a film that touched a nerve that's for sure.<br/><br/>It was based on an excellent novel of the same name by Anthony Burgess, a book made so brilliant in that its narrator Alex speaks throughout in the Nadsat slang which was an invented form of youth-speak of the near future, influenced by Russian; at the time it was written we were in the midst of the cold war and it was not unreasonably thought that Russian culture would seep through in the years that followed. Burgess was famously unhappy with Kubrick's adaption, seeing it as revelling in the sex and violence at the expense of the point he was making. In fact, the novel had been released in the United States in a different version to elsewhere, missing out the epilogue in which Alex concedes the error of his ways and decides to leave his life of violence behind. Kubrick had only read the American version and his film also missed out this final section much to Burgess's annoyance. In truth, the book would have worked better without Burgess ending, as it comes across as a little too idealistic and doesn't square very well with what has gone before. Needless to say, I think the film works better without it and in fact makes its central point far clearer too, i.e. Alex is inherently bad but this is a lesser evil than him being artificially good. Whatever the case, both book and film are marvellous.<br/><br/>It is a dark satire set in the near future where a young hoodlum called Alex and his gang of Droogs spend their nights fighting, raping and pillaging. Alex is eventually caught and imprisoned. He puts himself forward for an experimental aversion therapy procedure called the Ludovico technique that is designed to make sociopathic individuals experience feelings of terror when they have violent thoughts. The state's solution is ultimately seen as another form of violence as opposed to a true solution.<br/><br/>A Clockwork Orange is extremely stylised. Visually it's beautifully shot as you would expect from Kubrick. The sets alternate from the dreary to garish bad taste. Many places are decorated by strange, disturbing erotic art. The costumes are really great too, especially the iconic retro-futuristic styles worn by the Droogs. While soaring above everything is the incredibly distinctive soundtrack from Wendy Carlos - the electronic music used here was cutting edge at the time and went on to influence a whole cycle of synth groups in the late 70's / early 80's – it is really original sounding and considerably helps creating the distinctive world of the film; the moody, ominous main theme is particularly brilliant and futuristic versions of Beethoven are very unusual too. Acting is very stylised throughout but Malcolm McDowell truly shines in one of the most charismatic screen performances of all time. If you read the novel after seeing the film it is well-nigh impossible to do so without McDowell's tones ringing through your GulliverI mean head! Ultimately, I love this film but still find it somewhat disturbing to watch for several reasons. It's really rather unpleasant quite a lot of the time in actual fact but really I suppose that's the point. It's definitely one of the truly transgressive films released by Hollywood back in the days when they thought nothing of taking on such huge risks."
"vytalyx","10","1","3","24 June 2013"," What's it all about Alex? ... (More an interpretation than a review)
","Most people tend to focus on the visceral aspect of this masterpiece, but I think Kubrick used this to emphasize the point he made at the end. It was a caveat, and an encouragement to regard all abusers of power with the same disdain that you would have for Alex. They are all cut from the same cloth. They are all manipulative, self-serving sociopaths, and even though they are at opposite ends of the social ladder, they all occupy the same bottom rung of the respectability ladder. It was absolutely brilliant how Kubrick so intensely stimulated both the viscera (animal instincts), and the intellect, which is what the greatest art strives to achieve."
"Hawkensian","10","1","3","12 June 2013"," 'A Clockwork Orange' is a deranged piece of required viewing that has entered the annals of popular culture.
","I distinctly remember the first time I watched 'A Clockwork Orange'. I was only 11-years-old and it was a rainy, overcast afternoon – perfect conditions for watching a film. I was aware of the film's notoriety; I remembered my dad's excitement when he managed to find a copy of it in France in the late 1990s, telling me that it had been banned by the director in our country.<br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick died in 1999, and sometime between then and 2004 a newly released English copy had been bought, presumably by my dad. With a certain degree of espionage, I managed to find the VHS and slip it into my all-in-one television and VCR player.<br/><br/>As soon as the stark red and blue colouring of the opening scene flooded the screen, I was captivated. The strange aesthetic and Wendy Carlos' haunting Moog synthesiser soundtrack was unlike anything I had ever seen, I was utterly compelled by it and I knew I was watching something really special.<br/><br/>The film follows Alex and his three 'Droogs', a gang of amoral young men who spend their evenings beating, stealing and raping. Since my initial viewing all those years ago, I have realised what gripped me as an 11- year-old boy, the terrific energy of the film's first hour or so. Yes, you're watching the Droogs 'tolchock' and rape, however Alex's completely unhinged life unravels on the screen with such vitality; it's a thrillingly deranged trip that swiftly grabs and immerses its viewer like few films manage.<br/><br/>There is no other film that is quite like 'A Clockwork Orange'. It is riddled with idiosyncrasies, with its gaudy costumes, futuristic interior design and particularly 'Nadsat', the Droogs' esoteric language, some of which has since entered common parlance. It is also a film that truly feels British, particularly in its humour, which comes chiefly through the comments and sometimes rather slapstick actions of the eccentric central character. Another of its merits lies in Wendy Carlos' wonderful score. It blends classical pieces such as Rossini's The Thieving Magpie and Beethoven's Ninth Symphony with Carlos' Moog synthesiser renditions of Beethoven and Baroque music including Henry Purcell's March.<br/><br/>There's no doubt that the film aestheticises violence and indeed glorifies the central character. The character of Alex DeLarge is one of cinema's greatest. Malcolm McDowell gives Alex an undeniable charisma that charms you, making him an antihero that you find yourself very much rooting for. During all of his nastiness he is never hateful, he has that infamous sideways grin that's menacing and comical in equal measure.<br/><br/>All of this, of course, poses something of a moral dilemma. As the film progresses, our charismatic antihero who has both charmed us and appalled us willingly becomes the subject of a government experiment. Alex is a free man after undergoing the Ludovico Technique, which consists of forcing the subject to watch scenes of violence and rape whilst reconfiguring their brain. The treatment reduces Alex into a sickly coughing fit whenever he's in situation that's violent or sexual. <br/><br/>I don't think Kubrick's film is one of the great pieces of sociopolitical commentary. The main problem is that Alex is not just unrepentant, he's psychopathic. This complicates a discussion about the penal system because Alex is probably untreatable, unlike the doomed subject of 'A Short Film About Killing', a lost and disturbed young man who is executed by the state before he can rehabilitate. After Alex's meeting with the Home Secretary in the film's closing moments, Alex's psychopathy could be interpreted as a comment on how those with powerful executive jobs, such as those in Westminster, are more likely to show the psychopathic, machiavellian traits possessed by Alex. <br/><br/>To its credit, the film doesn't give any definite answers. Instead, it explores the complexities and difficulties of crime and punishment, presenting us with this dystopian vision of sheer state control and a wacky conclusion that leaves more questions than answers. <br/><br/>'A Clockwork Orange' is a spectacular synthesis of absurd aesthetic, striking cinematography, innovative music and an exceptional lead actor supported by a strong, interesting cast. It is a piece of required viewing that's entered the annals of popular culture.<br/><br/>www.hawkensian.com"
"thesar-2","5","1","3","27 April 2013"," Retribution like Clockwork
","Coming back down from space, though ""supposedly"" still in the future, I finished two back to back nights of two back to back Stanley Kubrick films: 2001: A Space Odyssey and A Clockwork Orange. And my initial thoughts were: ""Well, at least he's improved, albeit not by the REAL future's The Shining standards""<br/><br/>Actually, I can certainly acknowledge this is a well-made film and possibly a little ahead of its time in 1971, but there were just a few areas I just couldn't get past.<br/><br/>Such as, by words only, meaning hardly a moment on screen, was this a ""futuristic"" society. Yes, I'm aware this is 1971, and possibly filmed prior, and I didn't need to actually see things that didn't exist until decades later: cell phones, laptops, etc. But, almost everything in this movie was that timeframe without a speck of imagination of what the future might hold. For example: Records (yes, including the obvious 2001: A Space Odyssey LP,) landlines, cars, weapons, postersthey're all of the same period as the movie. Oh, I guess you can say medical experiments and blue hair might be considered ""advanced,"" but I felt no efforts were made to convince me they thought ahead. (Wait, I guess, hoodlums drink drugs, er, milk, at bars in the future. Yeah.)<br/><br/>Opposite the lack of visuals for the so-called ""FUUUUTURE,"" were too many mix-matched color or bland schemes on screen. While I am not a Kubrick fan, I absolutely can appreciate his drive, dedication and attention to the smallest of details. Since I know how masterful he is, I was shocked on how unpleasing the movie was to my eyes with the sets, colors, etc. Absolutely, this could've been his intention, and possibly his mark for what the ""bleak"" future would bring, so I do claim ignorance in that. But, nevertheless, the movie didn't disturb me in the ""darkness"" it should've portrayed; it was distracting on how nothing blended well. So much so, colors and sets reacted like two magnets close together.<br/><br/>Finally, given the time, Kubrick at the helm and especially following his finale to 2001: A Space Odyssey, the movie just had to go to odd and out-there psychedelic facial expressions. Of course, this could be interpreted in many, a few or even one right way, but for me, while I was watching both the F. Alexander character's overacting face outside the bathroom and Alex being fed at the end with his mouth opening and digesting food in such a way even a toddler would ridicule him. YesI have an idea why these actors made such drug-induced expressions, but it blended in with my previous point on how unpleasing this was to watch.<br/><br/>Now that we're past what personally irked me, I want to again state: I felt this was a well-made movie from all involved and I understand it's been dissected, interpreted, reviewed and acclaimed by many. In fact, many of that group might dislike, discount or flat out say I'm wrong for my view of the movie's shortcomings. Granted, that's everyone's right to an opinion as I am just giving what I witnessed.<br/><br/>Since I provided my three negatives, here are my three positives:<br/><br/>The story was very well done, classical, even. I loved the point of the journey of Alex and especially the outcome(s). Also, while admiring and enjoying Malcolm McDowell's performance, it was rather hard to see him so young! My Malcolm McDowell that I grew up on was from Star Trek: Generations and more recently, Rob Zombie's Halloween 1 and 2. (Of course, this is not a criticism; it was just weird for me, personally.) And finally, the dialogue was fairly well-done. When I could understand it, that is. Thank God for closed captioning. But, again, that's just me.<br/><br/>The movie centers around carefree, selfish, off and criminal(ly insane) ""teenager"" (McDowell was 28 at the time of release, so probably 26-27 during filming or so and looked it. In words only, he was a ""teen"") Alex, his brethren or ""droogs"" and his eventual capture, voluntary rehabilitation and eventually retribution in the most fun, yet unrealistic series of unfortunate events.<br/><br/>That one paragraph summed up the entire 136 minutes, but I would encourage people to see all that's involved in this fine movie. It's unapologetic use of the penis – phallic symbolism, rape and torture, both by criminals and government alike, might turn off some people, but I admired how far this director would go to show his vision of what these character's state of mind and surroundings were. Perhaps it was enormously taboo and experimental back 43 years ago, and I'm sure that's one reason it was nominated for best picture.<br/><br/>I thought I remembered having seen this roughly 17 years ago and that was the only time. Following the hardest scene for me to watch – the eye-opening scene (and not because of what he was watching on the screen in front of him, but my sensitivity to activity around the human eyes,) I don't recall a single segment. I probably gave up on the movie back then and thus, this is my first ever, full-viewing of A Clockwork Orange.<br/><br/>Despite my appreciation of most of this film, it really isn't a movie I'll probably watch again, any time soon, at least. Lord willing, I'm around in another two decades and maybe, I'll revisit the droogs gang with their milk'staches again."

","Yeah, I'm a fan.<br/><br/>I made a mistake of mentally blocking out this film for many years, harbouring a misconceived grudge that ACO is nothing more than an arty, complicated film-making statement about very little. Now I realise I was wrong.<br/><br/>It's an enjoyable film with an imaginative, sarcastic, pretty daft plot that rumbles along and keeps you interested (mostly) throughout. It's bizarre and rather stifled in places due to the exaggerated British/false accents and its generally old-fashioned feel, which isn't going to appeal to horror/violence/gore aficionados from the 21st Century, I accept that, especially due to its rather drawn out, pompous and indirect nature.<br/><br/>It's sordid entertainment regardless of how striking or bland it might seem, with an underlying, sinister presence, a revolted, angry attitude towards life, mostly society, but also with a soft underbelly and an almost dear, childishly witty heart - the heart of Kubrick, I guess.<br/><br/>I've gone through a phase of watching, appraising and re-evaluating Stanley Kubrick's films, all of them, since the 'The Killing' and 'Paths of Glory', and I'm pleased with 'A Clockwork Orange'. 9/10 for me."
"alexdzora","10","1","3","8 March 2013"," This movie is supposed to be disturbing!
","Excellent story! Brilliant film making. It's unbelievable it was done in the 60s, and it is quite fitting that it was done at that time as well. Kubrick has excellent insight into the twisted nature of humanity, and does an amazing job exposing it in this film. Malcolm McDowell plays his role amazingly too. I recommend this movie to anyone and everyone who likes to see movies which are meant to be twisted. You need a strong stomach to see this film, just be warned! <br/><br/>Don't forget Kubrick is also the one who filmed and directed 2001, and it should be watched in just as much grandeur as this film. What was considered ""modernist"" in design in the late 1960s, the design of the sets, clothing, and overall ""feeling"" of the film should be taken as something out of this world, and a commentary on human nature. Enjoy the film and take it in as commentary, and critical analysis of how evil people can be to one another, and to everyone they encounter."
"illbebackreviews","8","1","3","24 January 2013"," As a person who strongly disliked ""2001 A Space Odyssey"", this film, to me, DEFINITELY redeems Kubrick as a director!
","I am one of the few people on the planet of the Earth to absolutely hate '2001 A Space Odyssey' not because of action but because of its horrendous pacing issues and terrible dialogue and characters. Despite absolutely loving the Shining, I thought it would never be possible that Kubrick's name can ever be redeemed from another film but boy, I was WRONG! <br/><br/>'A Clockwork Orange' is a tale about a young criminal named Alex who, after being arrested for murder and rape is sent to a 14 year sentence at jail. During this time, he learns of a new treatment process that can ensure that criminals can become much better people and never have to go to jail. It is this very treatment that changes the life of a vile young criminal,or does it really? <br/><br/>The story to A Clockwork Orange is very beautiful and the characters in the movie really make the movie work all the better. We have an 18 year old Malcolm McDowell playing Alex. Let me start off by saying that he is absolutely brilliant in this movie as young Alex. He completely steals it with his performance and makes the story feel all the more realistic and powerful. <br/><br/>The rest of the characters aren't as big a focus as Andy by any means but we have his gang. It was interesting to see what their future became when Alex was arrested. That was great. Other characters such as the old man were easy to connect with. Now, there is one thing in this movie that feels a lot like '2001: A Space Odyssey' and that is the time it takes to really get into the story. This could so easily have become terrible for me to watch but 3 years later, Kubrick realized that if you were to make a movie that takes over 1 hour to get going that you would need to fully immerse with the characters, the story and have interesting dialogue and great acting and not just superb visual effects. Kubrick masters this in this movie. <br/><br/>Despite the long time it takes for the main story to get going, Kubrick easily distinguishes it with 2001 A Space Odyssey by providing so much depth to our main character Alex. We see him commit many terrible crimes such as rape and murder that we completely hate him as a person and wish him to die and suffer. In the first hour, Kubrick's intentions were clear; that is to make us hate Alex. <br/><br/>The next hour mainly focuses on the treatment and the aftermath. Now, the story isn't something so huge and grand like The Godfather or Star Wars or Lord of the Rings or any other immense franchise. Its a short film that is made longer to ensure we fully sympathize with Alex and Kubrick ensures we sympathize with him by the end of the movie. During the treatment we begin to feel for Alex as he goes through the torture realizing that his committed crimes were wrong. As he heads back home, the story really focuses on the good side of Alex making him a much more sympathetic character. <br/><br/>Now the story is just brilliantly told and adapted; there is no issue with that whatsoever. The character of Alex becomes such a likable character by the end of this movie that you simply cannot believe it. To me, the thing that made me love the movie all the more and really give this a TEN is John Williams' fantastic musical score to this movie. Its fair to see that Williams is the best at musical scores. His music is so powerful in the movie and adds such a creepy tone to it. <br/><br/>'A Clockwork Orange' in my opinion, after some heavy thinking, is my favorite Kubrick movie, in surpassing one of my all time top 20 movies, 'The Shining'. Its simple; the character of Alex is more powerful than Jack Torrence. The story told is more emotional and moving making us as an audience connect with him more. The music itself is better here than in the Shining all the more making A Clockwork Orange stand out as the clear victor!"
"jake-law123","8","1","3","29 December 2012"," Disturbing masterpiece!
","Kubrick films have always had a special thing to them that I have always loved. They all work in a specific way: Specific camera angles, specific music for each situation in the film, and specific stories to each scene. Every soul disturbing and spine chilling scene in this has its own story which puts me on edge to no end. From the unusual use of wide angle lenses, to the awkward camera angles, combined with the eerie music to set the mood makes for one great thrill ride.<br/><br/>Based on the novel by Anthony Burgess, Kubrick decided to bring the infamous Alex character to life in this evil version of Anthony's classic, bringing the characters, tone, and language to his own sick and twisted world.<br/><br/>Our main character named Alex, (Malcolm McDowell) and his three ""droogs"" all set out to spread chaos and mayhem around the world, breaking and entering, raping, beating, anything they can think of to make the world a worse place to live. Alex gets betrayed by his ""droogs and is sentenced 14 to life. He gets off the hook by participating in a new scientific experiment yet to be perfected, (change the cold blooded and deranged mind of a criminal into a peace loving citizen).<br/><br/>Kubrick excellently displays Anthony's attempt on the language barrier between Alex and the viewer. The language, the setting, the camera angles, and every other piece of scenery perfectly places us into this characters world. The scenes of violence in Alex's mind puts us in his shoes and shows us how messed up he is. We see unexplained images that confuse us, but also intrigue us, as we transport ourselves into his mind. Kubrick does not show mercy with the nudity. Every corner there is a pair of boobs in your face. This is not his simple intention to arouse the audience or to be explicit, but simply to show us that Alex lives in a world without rules, regret, or discipline, and how it immediately all changes when he gets caught and participates in the experiment, and how it affects his world later.<br/><br/>Kubrick truly is the only one who could have pulled off Anthony's vision. His absolute monstrous style of film making combined with the sick and twisted mind of Anthony Burgess easily makes this one of the darkest films of all time. I enjoyed every second of this classic story. The dark tone, the beautiful dialog and narration, and the excellent story telling makes this an easily enjoyed masterpiece."
"jnelso19","10","1","3","23 December 2012"," One That Was Made Way Ahead of It's Time
","Considering that this film is still considered intense even in times where The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Piranha are released, it shows how far Kubrick looked forward to in this film. Of course anyone who is a cinephile, (aka those who write reviews on here. haha) knows of Stanley Kubrick and his historically relevant habit of pushing the button (his filmography till the day he dies is Exhibit A). It didn't stop after 2001 and is in fact pushed to the point where it became a major X Factor in film (get it? haha). Yet as button pushing films come and go (Human Centipede just popped in my head as I'm writing this), one could asked why this one is Etch a Sketched in our brains. Answer: It's real. Whether it describes how cruel humans can be to one another to how they try to have absolute control on things they can't and when they fail how they try to pick things up. This film not only describes human nature, but it describes it in a way anyone who can handle the more sexually explicit and violent scenes can think and say ""Yeah this has been done in real life before."" If you can do that and still make a film solid through great acting, writing and directing. Then you have a winner, sadly the Academy didn't think so and the history of them getting things wrong continued (Sorry Gene Hackman, The French Connection didn't deserve to win.)"

","An all time favorite! I watched the film a first time thinking, what exactly was I getting myself into? After a second viewing though, I began to really connect the points. The flipping of views and association with the characters makes it difficult to choose a side in this cult film. You are left questioning throughout the whole movie. The disgusting scenes and vulgar speech only adds to the questioning. You will never truly ""figure out"" this film, but can take the many underlying messages portrayed away with you as you leave the theater of your television. Think abstractly and consider a second viewing instead of running away with a bad impression."

"bandw","9","1","3","15 August 2012"," Any movie that elicits such a variety of reactions cannot be all bad
","This movie is presented in four acts. In act one we meet Alex and his three henchmen; the four of them burgle, assault, and rape their way through this act, terminated by a killing. In act two Alex is caught and put in prison where, in order to be let free, he volunteers for a Pavlovian anti-violence treatment. In act three Alex is followed after his release from prison; he is as helpless as a declawed cat and ultimately attempts suicide. Act four has Alex the subject of therapy to reverse his prior brainwashing.<br/><br/>The reactions to this movie are all over the map, from ""masterpiece"" to ""disgusting."" I find that my reactions to it are also all over the map. The violence in the first act is repellent and an assault on the senses, yet at the same time it is presented in such a stylized manner that it is transfixing. I saw this in its original release and have never forgotten the brutality of the scene in the house--ever since then I reflexively tense up whenever my doorbell rings and I don't know who it is. The fear of being transgressed upon in your own home is primal, dating back to the cave men I would think. The encounter between Alex's crew and the rival gang is beautifully choreographed and seems to be a send-up of the barroom brawls in old westerns. It's like Kubrick is saying, ""I'll show you how that can be done.""<br/><br/>The scenes where Alex is being subjected to the ""Ludovico treatment"" are about as difficult to watch as the scenes of violence. This raises the question of just what practices should be sanctioned in an attempt to control crime. What is done to Alex seems to go over the line, robbing him of the ability to make certain decisions. But then, imprisonment itself robs people of many basic rights, and the death penalty takes away all rights. The question of what rights should be sacrificed in the pursuit of safety is highly relevant in the USA of 2012.<br/><br/>The satire in this is not as biting or hilarious as that in ""Dr. Strangelove,"" but there is a heavy dose of it. The man whom Alex and his gang violated in his home adopts a liberal stance of being appalled at the inhuman Ludovico treatment, that is until he found out who Alex was, and then he wanted to torture him. The government minister who touted the Ludovico treatment was quick to flip his opinion when the treatment was deemed cruel.<br/><br/>It is hard to imagine what this would be without Malcomb McDowell's magnificent performance. He had a good run there in the 1968-1971 time frame with ""If...,"" ""O Lucky Man,"" and this film. There are other standout performances; I particularly appreciated Michael Bates' Hitlerian fascist prison guard.<br/><br/>Some forty years on this movie has not aged a bit. I doubt if this could be made now and, if it were, I doubt it would find a distributor. The fact that the rating was changed from its original ""X"" to ""R"" is a commentary on how society views content.<br/><br/>This is a unique, thought provoking movie filled with stunning images that are not easily forgotten."
"ferguson-6","9","1","3","12 July 2012"," A bit of the ol' ...
","Greetings again from the darkness. Director Stanley Kubrick only made 11 feature films, and there have been arguments made for all 11 to be considered cinematic classics. This one must surely be included with Spartacus, Dr Strangelove, 2001: A Space Odyssey, and The Shining as films that are safe and secure in movie history. Based on the novella from Anthony Burgess, the focus on Alex makes this an extremely uncomfortable film to watch, even 41 years after original release.<br/><br/>Malcolm McDowell is just terrific as Alex, the sadistic, remorseless, psychotic leader of a pack of hoodlums who terrorize innocents just for the sake of doing so. To emphasize Alex's distorted view of society, Kubrick utilizes a wide-angle lens to show us his Point of View. There is much commentary in the film and most of it is quite obvious. One of the least discussed is the interaction of Alex and his ""droogs"". When they tire of his relentless power-mongering and the lack of big scores from all of their criminal activity, we see how young thugs would handle such a situation.<br/><br/>There is also much criticism directed at the British government and the world of psychiatry, especially mind-control. Kubrick obviously had extreme views on these topics as he went off-track from the source material to make his points. The idea of moral choice being the distinguishing factor of a man could be debated, but seems logical when contrasted with the anti-violence rehabilitation system favored by the minister.<br/><br/>There are some fascinating visuals with the milk-plus bar, the artwork and wide-angle lens ... especially when focused on Patrick Magee's face during the rape scene. Also, the use of Ludwig van Beethoven to put Alex in the mood for ""ultra-violence"", and then his subsequent song and dance to ""Singin in the Rain"", show what the other side of music can mean to those not quite right in the head.<br/><br/>The film received four Oscar nominations including Best Picture and Best Director, though sadly, McDowell was not recognized. While there is much in the film that is difficult to watch, the brilliance of the material, script, acting and directing are a treat for movie lovers. One bit of trivia: that is David Prowse who plays the writer's bodyguard. Mr. Prowse would go on to play Darth Vader in the Star Wars films."
"TOMASBBloodhound","10","1","3","24 June 2012"," Brilliant. Unforgettable.
","A Clockwork Orange is an incredible experience. Few films have the ability to grab your attention quite like this one. No matter what age you were when you first saw it, the film most likely changed the way you look at cinema. I would still give a slight edge to 2001 as far as which is Kubrick's best, but it's a photo finish.<br/><br/>Our story centers around a mischievous young gang leader and the attempt by society to change him into a model citizen through the means of chemically squelching his violent or lusty desires. The first act shows how ruthless the young man named Alex and his ""droogs"" are, and some of the trouble they get into. We see how disrespectful he is toward his parents, and society in general. After a dispute over control of his gang, he finds himself solely responsible for the death of a woman. Alex is sentenced to a considerable length of time in jail, and soon he volunteers to participate in a new experiment designed to curb people's lust for sex and violence. We are never quite sure if he really wants to be ""good"" as he claims, or if he just wants out of jail. After two years as a model prisoner and some considerable sucking up to the prison Chaplain, Alex is cleared for the treatment. Little does he or anyone else seem to realize (except maybe the Chaplain) just how helpless the treatment will make him back in the outside world.<br/><br/>The film, though made with a paltry budget, is a technical wonder. Kubrick once again mixes sight and sound like the master he was. The futuristic world these characters live in looks like a fully amplified version of 1971. Tacky, but kind of beautiful. The stylized dialect these characters talk with will be ringing in your ears well after the film is over. The film contains numerous rape and assault scenes that can still be somewhat off-putting even if you've seen the film a dozen times. It's easy to see why this film was pulled from distribution in England for so many years. Even by today's standards, the violent acts may seem graphic.<br/><br/>The most amazing thing about the film is Malcolm McDowell. As Kubrick himself has stated, this film really couldn't have been made without him. His performance as Alex is on par with some of the best acting even done in movies. What's most amazing is how he can create such a lecherous character and then make him almost sympathetic in some scenes. Especially as he refers to the audience as his only friends once he's sent to prison. You almost feel sorry for him even though he probably deserves a much more severe punishment. Once he has been brainwashed of all his violent and sexual tendencies, Alex invokes nothing but pity. He cannot even fight off an elderly mugging victim who remembers him from years earlier. To top things off, two of his former gang members have become cops and now take pleasure in beating him up and leaving him for dead in the country. His parents don't seem to want him back, either.<br/><br/>After all is said and done, we learn that people just cannot live without their animal instincts and free will. The treatment was most-likely scrapped after what happened to Alex, and hopefully society was able to find a more successful way to deal with their crime problem.<br/><br/>The film is amazing in any way a film can be. No DVD collection is complete without it! If you haven't seen it, then for goodness sakes get to your local video store and see what you've been missing!!!! 10 of 10 stars from the Hound."

","Don't be put-off by the ultra-violence in A clockwork Orange, this film is a satirical masterpiece that works on many levels. I would argue that, given the proper consideration, this film rivals 2001: A Space Odyssey in its ability to amaze, albeit in a converse way. Being a Kubrick film the cinematography is second to none, even if the synthesizers and set pieces feel very 70's today. The visuals are as woefully disturbing as they are beautiful, and really portray a world as seen only through Alex's eyes. Malcolm McDowell's performance gives meaning to the term ""born for the role.""<br/><br/>The story contains a multitude of themes, from political (freewill vs. government control), sociological (the hypocrisy of modern society), and philosophical (morality and how we define good and evil), offers a damning commentary on behavioral psychology, and is fraught with a fiendish irony. You might describe this film as an Orwellian-like warning about the dangers of government control on free will. But it is also a dark philosophical take on the nature of mankind, the essence of the human soul, and the evil that dwells somewhere inside us all. Sociopathic Alex may be pure evil, but he is as pure as the music of lovely, lovely, Ludwig Van. Leave it to Stanley Kubrick to show us the good in evil.<br/><br/>Many people will never be able to get past its graphic sexual violence and arguably pessimistic view of mankind, and I can understand this. While I agree the images are very disturbing and can make it hard to watch, I believe judging this film based solely on this aspect is missing the point. It took 2 or 3 viewings for me to fully realize everything that was going on, and I still find the story very compelling.<br/><br/>While I have not read the book, I understand the film omits the last chapter, and this changes the ending significantly. I prefer the ending of the film because it leaves the story more open to interpretation. This is also part of what makes the film so daring, even today. How often do you see a film that offers this much food for thought? Truly a work of art from a man who pushed the boundaries of the medium."
"wilcojunkie3","10","1","3","27 September 2011"," This is probably Kubrick's best work, how can you hate?
","This is a great movie. And I've read the book which is, amazingly, even more disturbing. Yeah, it's sick. That's the point. But the only flaw is that Kubrick, who is an amazing director, used the American version of the novel rather than the original British version, in which Alex grows up and lives a normal life. But that's still not the point of the movie or the book. It's a commentary on how we have allowed society to become OK with ""ultra-violence."" It's supposed to be about how if we continue down this road we could actually allow 14 y.o. boys (that's what age they were in Burgess's novel) go around raping women and young girls (they were 10 y.o. in the novel) and beating innocent people, doing drugs, etc. I mean if you want to criticize someone let it be the author. Kubrick was just making a wonderful piece of art, and he even toned it down a lot. And yet it still was looked down upon in the country it was written and filmed about. Yet the academy and critics accepted it for what it was. Sure it is disturbing. That's the point. We all watch war movies and think nothing of violence. How is this different? This is fiction. The movie is almost addictive. I have see much worse movies that are hard to watch. Ever seen Funny Games? Now THAT is a messed up movie, much worse than this in my opinion. Doesn't make it a bad film. Heck, watch any horror movie. Just because you could see their faces shouldn't make it worse. Great movie, I don't care what anyone says."

","When I was in my teens, I resisted joining street gangs, believing such groups to be essentially mindless. When they put on their clothes to go out each evening, they were not just following the latest fashions, but putting on battle uniforms. Joining would in my view been a major error of judgement. In the early '80's, a new street gang came to my town. On Saturday afternoons, half a dozen or so young men strutted about the shopping centre in white boiler suits and bowler hats, and carrying canes. People kept well away from them. I did not know it then, but they were mimicking the 'Droogs' - the gang from Stanley Kubrick's 'A Clockwork Orange' ( 1971 ). Like Peckinpah's 'Straw Dogs' ( 1971 ) and Hooper's 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' ( 1974 ), a mystique built up around the film because it was impossible to see for many years. When it finally became commercially available - after the director's death - a minority grumbled it was 'overrated'. Not so. 'A Clockwork Orange' is marvellous. Based on Anthony Burgess' provocative and thought-provoking novel, it is about a gang with no respect for authority led by 'Alex DeLarge' ( Malcolm McDowall ) whose hobbies are rape, ultra-violence and Beethoven. They even have their own language. A good night out to them involves at some point the beating-up of an old tramp. In one of the most shocking scenes ever put on film, they break into the home of writer Mr.Alexander ( Patrick Magee ) and rape his wife ( Adrienne Corri ) in front of him while warbling 'Singing In The Rain'. Eventually, Alex is caught, jailed, and subjected to a new kind of aversion therapy. No longer capable of violent acts, he is released. But some of his victims have not forgotten nor forgiven him, and set about exacting revenge...<br/><br/>This is a fascinating study of the morality of free will. It poses the question - is a man who has has been born good better than one who has had goodness imposed on him? Is the State's brainwashing of Alex any better than the ultra-violence he himself practised? McDowall is magnificent, playing a sneering, arrogant young man with nothing but contempt for the world and everyone in it. But when he is reprogrammed you start feeling sorry for him! Also in the cast are Warren Clarke as fellow Droog 'Dim' and Michael Bates as a 'Prison Guard'. The recently deceased Miriam Karlin is a cat lover whom Alex beats to death with a huge plastic phallus! Kubrick himself wrote the script and did a fair job, but alas changed the ending. In the book, Alex renounces his violent past, choosing to settle down and have a family. But the film creates the impression he will revert back to his bad old ways.<br/><br/>The film attracted controversy on its release for its explicit violence and sex ( Alex beds a couple of young girls at one point, and a joke is made out of it by the sex being sped up to music ). Kubrick withdrew it after copy-cat crimes were reported. Even now it is disturbing to watch, yet impossible to ignore. Yes, it is extremely violent, but the storyline demands it to be. Once seen it can never be forgotten."

I haven't read the book, but i'm sure that what Kuberick did with it was what the novel had going for it: Trippiness. Like Darren Arronofsky's Requiem for a dream, watching A Clockwork Orange makes you feel stoned.<br/><br/>Alex DeLarge(Malcolm McDowell) is the film's hero, or is he? Alex is a gang leader who breaks into houses and terrorizes people. That is, until his other gang members are tired of his tyranny, and sell him out to the police.<br/><br/>While in jail, they try a new experiment on Alex to turn him good so then when he gets out he'll be as good as new. This works, but once he gets out he realizes that his life and the lives of others will never be the same.<br/><br/>A Clockwork Orange is an intriguing and at times insanely hilarious film. McDowell, who nowadays just does minor roles, is wickedly funny in this film. Who'd of thought that you could like such a terrible person? A Clockwork Orange is up there with 2001: A Space Odyssey, Barry Lyndon, and The Shining as one of Stanley Kuberick's many great films. A clockwork Orange is a sight for sore eyes that keeps you engaged, even if it does feel a little long.<br/><br/>A"

","Stanley Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange""(1971) is one of the first movies that proved that cinema can be the most enlightening and amazing art form around. Even though it remains unappreciated because of the violence and the perversity bursting from the scenes, analysing and watching the film carefully would stress the important problems in society and the ways to prevent these.<br/><br/>Adapted from the novel of Anthony Burgess, the story is told by 16- year- old Alex DeLarge (Malcolm McDowell) in a future Britain. Because of his interests being ultra-violence and rape he shortly ends up in jail. Not being able to hold up to the hard conditions in jail, he volunteers for an experimental aversion therapy developed by the government to solve the society's crime problem. The therapy turns out to be a brainwashing program, which turns Alex into a dog-like proper citizen and when he's finally out on the streets, he faces the people whom he's tortured, hurt, raped or violated. And they're not willing to let Alex walk away safely.<br/><br/>Alex did give up his violent self during the therapy but what he couldn't give up was listening to Ludwig Van. This is why almost all of the scenes are accompanied by a variation of Beethoven's 9th Symphony. The opposition of the mind-twisting ultra-violent scenes and the calm and relaxing 9th Symphony and more classical music show Kubrick's talent once again. Although the film is a long one (136 minutes), you're not bored while watching the perfectly realistic and remarkable scenes. The film has been criticised a lot, and it has been said that it leads teenagers to violence and was also once an R-rated (Under 17 requires accompanying by a parent or adult guardian) movie for almost 30 years. However it has been nominated for 4 Oscars and has won 5 awards and 12 other nominations. <br/><br/>As well as being a movie of violence and sexual repulsion, Stanley Kubrick's direction of ""A Clockwork Orange"" also forces us to thoroughly question ourselves and that's why it is a masterpiece and will remain a ""must see"", a classic for many years to come."
"BertMacklin_9","10","1","3","19 March 2011"," Beautiful, disturbing, funny, haunting, classic.
","Stanely Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange"" is his best work, and one of the best movies ever made. One big ""thing"" about this movie that really makes it a landmark film in history is its content. This movie is really rated 'R'. Explicit sex, rape, and sadistic violence. This doesn't make the movie good, but in the 70's when it was released, it shocked everyone, and was even withdrawn from England. This really shows Stanley Kubrick's fearless directing. So that's a big reason why its known as a landmark film. But as a movie itself, its flawless. Malcom Mcdowell (who should've been nominated for Best Actor when released) gives such a chilling portrayal of a disturbed young man. In the beginning, just the his voice overs give you the chills, and with dialouge, he again is so chilling. Then towards the conclusion, he shows his transformation, and is so vulnerable. Classic performance in film history. Next, Stanley Kubrick's directing is so beautiful, and yet, disturbing. This movie really introduced deep psychological themes, and many movies were not advanced like it at that time in the 70's. Next, Stanley Kubrick is just such an innovative director. His directing gives his movies just such a visual attraction. He just uses so many techniques and made this film so creative and groundbreaking for any movie at that time. This movie has such a great screenplay too, also written by Stanley Kubrick. The screenplay has such great narration by Alex. It delivers his madness and thoughts in such a casual way, that that becomes the attitude of the film, and you get comfortable with it. It also has great dialouge. It also is very ""weird"" and not super realistic, but Stanley Kubrick constructs this future society so easily that the dialouge comes so naturally. It also blends a very sadistic form of dark humor. Along with being a sci-fi psychological movie, it also is known as a dark-comedy. And so this makes this screenplay very fresh and smart. So I love this movie. Its definitely one of my favorites. While some older movies can feel kind of out-dated, this movie is just so advanced and really original that it will really always be mentioned as a strong part of movie history. 10 out of 10 stars"
"walruspower60","10","1","3","22 February 2011"," A bizarre, terrifying masterpiece of cinema.
","Stanley Kubrick's a Clockwork orange is one of the best movies ever. And unlike the media portrays it, it is not a simplistic glorification of violence. It is a beautiful in it's camera and artwork, it's music is genius, every aspect of production is perfect. However, most importantly, the character and story are genius. Alex, from the description of him being a snobby, violent, delinquent murderer hoodlum, sounds like a despicable character. But like all good movies starring anti-heroes, the movie just dares us to forget morals and like him. Because it is truly impossible not to like him. Despite the fact that he is a violent murderer, he is one of the coolest characters in movies. The plot is fairly simple. Alex gets put in jail and is subject to a new conditioning treatment, and is sent out into the world again. To say anything beyond that would be to spoil the story. Every little aspect of this movie is perfect. I don't know what more to say."
"DeadlyGibbon","10","1","3","22 January 2011"," The Greatest Film Ever Made
","That's not an exaggeration of my opinion, I genuinely think that A CLockwork Orange is simply the most imaginative, well acted, directed and scripted film in the history of cinema. While I accept and am fine with other people thinking otherwise, I don't think anyone has any right in criticising it. The music is superb, Malcolm McDowell portrays Alex perfectly, always how I imagined him when reading the book (before I saw the film). There is a slight dip towards the end of the film, when Alex stays with Mr Alexander, but the final scenes involving the nurse and minister retain the opening and middle's genuinely mind-blowing quality.<br/><br/>The atmosphere and emotion of the film is made much more impressive by the electrifying lighting, something Kubrick was so good at, and unforgettable shots. The opening and closing shots have never been bettered (perhaps 2001: A Space Odyssey) and the film is filled to the brim with an array of iconic and beautiful images.<br/><br/>The ending may have been different to the book, but somehow, I could never quite see how the ending of the book would have made this film better or worse. It just doesn't need it. I've seen this film 15 times now, twice at the BFI cinema screen, and each time it gets better and better."
"poe426","7","1","3","10 September 2010"," Masterpiece of Static Cinema...
","As someone who's spent time laboring in the no-budget world of experimental film and video, I can appreciate A CLOCKWORK ORANGE on a purely technical level. By the same token, I recognize in it (and in most of what Kubrick did) an almost amateurish overindulgence. Being by nature a photographer, his emphasis was naturally on the Visual; characters were there to simply enhance the shots he set up. In A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, long static scenes unfold (one after another) as the camera sits and watches. This is a habit many low budget, indie filmmakers engage/indulge in: I've done it myself over the years. But it's a mistake when a paid professional does it because it results in what could best be called ""motionless pictures."" So intent is Kubrick on the Visual in A CLOCKWORK ORANGE that he never even bothers to explain the significance of the title. A small oversight, perhaps, but an oversight nonetheless."

","Undoubtedly one of the most controversial films of all time, Stanley Kubrick's portrayal of a corrupt and violent future has achieved much praise as a cult film but has been misunderstood by many.<br/><br/>The film begins with three brilliant scenes. We discover who the four men are, what their business is and who they stand for but as the film goes on, we learn that these four men don't have much of an agenda, they just find thrill in committing such horrible acts.<br/><br/>Alex, the main character and narrator, leads this gang he calls his ""droogs"" through an ordinary night. After raping an author's wife and ravaging their home, Alex retires to his comfortable home where we discover he does appreciate some things in life, such as fine art and animal life. As soon as he plays his favorite musician, we get a brief glimpse of how his mind operates and how naturally he feels the impulses of rape, death and violence.<br/><br/>The next day, we meet his mum and dad, both unusual characters yet they stand out for some reason. We learn a little more about Alex, he is an intelligent and well spoken young man, who has seemed to never get himself into any serious trouble. Then he gets into a disagreement with his droogs and gives them a harsh lesson to convince them who their true leader is.<br/><br/>The gang plans another fun night by going to a house owned by a feline lover. Alex gets himself into the house, alone and confronts the lady, who is strong and unwilling to be taken advantage of. A fight ensues with both Alex and the cat lady using a symbolic weapon, Alex a phallic statue and the cat lady the head of Beethoven. The cat lady ends up dead in a very memorable scene.<br/><br/>As soon as he leaves, the droogs turn on Alex and leave him for the police. This is where the film takes a turn. Alex begins to shift into a different person. We see him reading the bible, indicating he's always had a god-like persona that he wishes to change.<br/><br/>Alex agrees to undergo an experimental procedure to make him unable to do any wrong doing at all. Alex then gets an early release from prison and onto a new start.<br/><br/>Alex arrives home where he has seemingly been replaced by a lodger. This is where the attitude for Alex has taken a complete shift, the audience now feels they should sympathize for him when they once loved to hate him.<br/><br/>After a couple more visits from old friends, Alex unintentionally ends up facing another past victim, the author who's wife Alex brutally raped. Out of hospitality, Alex is fed and clothed but the author then recognizes him and prepares something to exploit his new weaknesses. The Beethoven that Alex used to lust for has been replaced with feelings of pain and sickness. Alex decides to ""snuff it"" out of this cruel and wicked world.<br/><br/>But of course it was unsuccessful, obviously as he had been narrating the film all along. We next find him in a hospital bed, he is recovering yet we are not sure if his weaknesses persist. The doctor conducts a test and we learn that some of his past philosophy has returned but how much? The very last scene reveals much more, Alex has most likely returned to his old self. But we are still left with many things to think about. Should we, ourselves be the only ones to make choices, even if we choose to be evil? This film has so many elements that make it memorable, including great characters, ironic use of music, great cinematography and a theme that will stand the test of time.<br/><br/>10/10. This films style is incredible but it is its content that people usually don't see. Several viewings are probably required."

","I had been dying to see A Clockwork Orange because of all the hype and criticism surrounding this motion picture. It has been known for its grotesque display of sex, violence, and music which make people rather squeamish but, hey, it didn't disturb the crap out of me. Stanley Kubrick never came across to me as a wonderful director and A Clockwork Orange is no exception. His work maybe daring but his films are to old fashioned and boring. 2001: A Space Odyssey was probably the most boringest movies ever because most of the time it was about a couple of monkeys sniffing each others butts. I don't see how people get into that sort of stuff. The ""Old-Ultraviolence"" moments were where you saw people being beaten to death or ladies being raped by a couple of hoodlums, as described in the film. Malcolm McDowell was truly great in this film but I can't say it's the best movie he has ever been in. I have hardly seen him act in any films but he is known for films that had nudity (like Caligula). He provides the role of someone who is angry and he uses his anger towards his victims. The accents from the actors in this film were particularly good if not weird. The film is banned in most countries for it's realism of sex and violence but, thankfully, it is not banned in Australia. The cover for this film is mysterious and...... ah sh*t......mmmm.............mysterious. Damn! I ran out of words. Please pardon that Language I would like to call French. Not the French spoken In France But the swearing French. Okay? So don't report me. The setting for this film could not have been better because it provided the exact atmosphere I needed. A Clockwork Orange will leave some peoples minds after two hours but with some, e.g. Old People, it will stay there with them forever and ever and ever. If I had to choose the most disturbing thing that disturbed me during this film it would have to be the scene where Alex's eyes are literally glued to the screen. Some people find find that funny so go on and laugh.<br/><br/>A gang of hoodlums are on the loose in Britain and the aftermath is devastating. An old man has nearly been beaten to death and some women have died from the gangs vicious hands but that is not the end or worst of it. One night a plan fails leaving the main Character, Alex, to be thrown into prison. Two years later, Alex is still rotting in the jail until he hears a new treatment that can brainwash you into stopping your old ""Habits"". Alex becomes the guinea pig of the experiment and changes into a new man...... or does he? From then on people will use him to take down the government and he will meet some of his old buddies. The consequences will be dire but the end will be inevitable. <br/><br/>If you are looking for a horror, look somewhere else because this isn't one of them. It is more of a drama and will appeal to some. If you are planning to watch this one a date with your girlfriend prepare to be dumped or worse, being spat into the face.. Really, I mean it. The book is very hard to find so i don't know if the film is accurate or not. Anyway, If you want to watch a disturbing-sci-fi-thriller-crime drama then this id for you. 7-10 - Good for what it is!"
"TxMike","Null","1","3","18 February 2010"," A very dark comedy from the mind of Kubrick.
","I saw this movie in the theater a long time ago, probably in the 1970s not long after its release. I didn't remember too much about it, just the general theme. I saw it again, on Netflix streaming video.<br/><br/>Malcolm McDowell is Alex, the defacto leader of a group of 4 thugs in near future England. His is a charming and deceiving fellow, who sleeps all day and misses school because, he tells his parents, his head hurts. But during the night he and his fellow thugs look for trouble and items that can be fenced for easy cash. And sometimes for more fun, a brawl with competitive thugs.<br/><br/>During one break-in a lady fights back, wounds Alex by hitting him on the head with a heavy piece of artwork, a small statue, and in anger he smashes something into her face. She had been suspicious and called the police a bit earlier, and Alex was arrested when they showed up. The injured lady died in the hospital, so he was convicted of murder and sentenced to 14 years.<br/><br/>After two years he heard about an experimental rehabilitation treatment, and through his cunning got picked for the project. He would receive the intensive psychological treatment, forced to view violence on film, and after 14 days (a fortnight) be cured and released to society.<br/><br/>Back with his freedom it wasn't easy. He met up with old friends and old enemies and was given back bad treatment each time. He even tried to kill himself, but only ended up badly injured, in the hospital. And, as the movie ends, we see a flash of what is in his mind, and it looks like he may be back to his old way of thinking, always looking for sex or violence, and maybe both at the same time.<br/><br/>This movie might also have been a commentary of British government and British society back in 1970, I don't know.<br/><br/>Edit: April 2013, saw it again on DVD, the newly released Kubrick 9-movie set from my public library. Video and audio are great."
"joshi_3592","10","1","3","4 December 2009"," Astounding, disturbing and mind boggling at the same time.
","I must admit Stanley Kubrick films are very hard to write reviews too, because they have so many variables to them. In a Kubrick film there's always more than meets the eye, and I Will admit hat even though I just finished seeing it, I probably missed half the point of the movie. Nevertheless I recommend this film for anyone who like deep and meaning full films. Although it's a little graphic I wouldn't recommend it for the weak at heart. Also if your a Stanley Kubrick fan and you haven't seen this yet, what are you waiting for? Go buy it or rent it immediately.<br/><br/>What's the movie about? A teenage gang leader who likes rape, ultra violence and Beethoven. Eventually he is caught and put in a prison. he then agrees to a new treatment who supposedly removes everything ""evil"" from a person. After a series of torture like and brain washing treatments, every time he tries to commit and act of violence or sexuality, he feels sick. he's released out into the world ""cured"", but will he be accepted? And let's just say, few people are fond of him.<br/><br/>I really don't know what else to say than that this is a true cinematic masterpiece. It's one of Stanley Kubricks best. I can't think of anything to give it, but a 10/10."
"sampit","8","1","3","25 November 2009"," Seductive,Disturbing,Pervert and an engrossing masterpiece studded with some brilliant acting.
","The main protagonist Alex is a sociopath with no emotion who revels in sex, violence, and talks in a weird language, has a python for a pet and loves listening to Beethoven,especially the 9th symphony. He sings ""Singing in the rain"" during a rape scene and drinks milk in some sleazy bar full of nude female mannequins. The movie is highly entertaining with a solid storyline and some amazing cinematography. This is a controversial masterpiece, and, in a way groundbreaking, thought provoking and downright intelligent. You see a spectacle of absurd dialogue's, interesting costumes, gaudy sets and some bold images. Kubrick's on screen depiction a female body is disdainful, cold, cheap, and impersonal. The scenes portraying nudity are unaesthetically done but that goes with the the feel of the film. <br/><br/>Although the film opens on a very strong note it tends to drag a bit in the second half. The fight scenes thou foolish are thoroughly entertaining. The movie raises a very important issue that a man ceases to be a man due to his inability to make a choice and is driven by suicidal tendencies. <br/><br/>The term clockwork orange is some kind of a compound metaphor. It means something organic(free) has been converted to a controllable and an inorganic process. The experiment that Alex undergoes carves out ""clockwork oranges"" out of human beings such that they have no decision making ability and are forced to act in a some predetermined way no matter what the circumstances. <br/><br/>We have seen many movies that glorify violence where we are love with a protagonist who kills for fun. But never was I repulsed by a film portraying violence. This movie showed that nothing good ever comes due to violence but the condition deteriorates further into evil. It's a very weird and a bizarre film, but for those who can digest it is thoroughly entertaining. It's not watered down and surely not for everyone, but surely an experience not easily forgotten.<br/><br/>Till then Viddy well my Brother Sir, Viddy well."

","You have to watch it several times to really understand what I mean. Every time you watch it, you'll pick up on more, and it will be that much more powerful. The main character, Alexander DeLarge is that dark part of everyone that we keep hidden away, repressed. But He embraces it, the hate, the darkness. He has the bravery to just pick up and roll with it. And he's only about 15. This film is definitely not for your kids, or for anyone who's even slightly squeamish. It's not so much that the violence is graphic, but really just powerful the way it is done. Kubrick definitely knew what he was going for, and nailed it perfectly."
"Chrisgb-91","9","1","3","10 April 2009"," Artistic, powerful, intriguing, gripping main performance and an increasingly relevant message
","Kubrick is so immensely clever when it comes to film-making isn't he? A Clockwork Orange pours out his talent as a director. He is well known for his perfectionism and this, combined with his shining vision for films has contributed to a masterful stroke in thought-provoking cinema.<br/><br/>Most of you know the plot so I went spend a lot of time slaving over it. It's futuristic Britain, law and order has almost vanished and different gangs of thugs roam the country wreaking havoc wherever they go. The film begins by focusing on one of these gangs, which is led by the films central character, Alex DeLarge (played by the awesome Malcolm McDowell). He and his fellow ""Droogs"" (russian for 'Buddies') roam their town causing all kinds of chaos: beating the elderly, robbing their victims, breaking into houses and raping women. All these activities playing a part in their pleasure of indulging in a bit of the old ""ultra-violence"". However, a mutiny arises within the group and Alex is left stranded by his Droogs during a house robbery which has left a women dead. The police arrive as Alex is recovering from a bottle smash to the face. Whilst in prison, he longs for freedom and his opportunity comes when a new method is introduced. The newly elected government wants to crack down on crime and by trying to do this, they conjure a method which involves transforming current convicts into law-abiding, good citizens. Sounds good? it may do but the description is only scratching the surface as we are taken into a dark world of state control and brain-washing techniques.<br/><br/>The debate raised within the film in terms of criminals being brain-washing tests the minds of the audience. They are criminals, murderers after all, as in the case of Alex. However, during the scenes of the experiments, you can't help but feel it still isn't right. Depending on your stance towards reform, the images on screen pluck all sorts of feelings from within you. The message of state control over individuals is resounding. The film is 30 odd years ahead of its time and I believe this to be a testament to the poignancy of the film and also the cleverness of the author of the book, Anthony Burgess. The scenes of ""ultra-violence"" are also becoming more and more common in modern life. The scenes are so disturbing, not because of the brute force but because of the sheer pleasure the characters are taking out of the rape and violence as they destroy lives (""I'm singing' in the rain!""). The lack of a soul, remorse or any human feeling. The performances from all the actors are of near perfection to the vision of Kubrick and the state of Britain which the film is trying to portray. Its future Britain and I think the lack of a blockbuster budget has greatly benefited the film. Instead of building extravagant futuristic sets as seen in Bladerunner and Back to the Future II, the film uses the oddly designed concrete gems from 1960's Britian (notice the sarcasm). This approach not only greatly adds to the realism of the film but also the overall bleakness and reality. The film is also artistically ground-breaking. From the glorious set-designs and costumes, to the use of beautiful classical music being played over the top of images of violence and rape. This juxtaposition works fantastically well, stirring the emotions and thoughts inside us at a constant rate. The language used in the film is not only amusing but also strangely effecting. It's nonsensical language but we still understand every word. It's twisted and subversive and it has a profound effect on the audience. The use of music is also of artistic excellence with a superb blend of electronic noises to Beethovens beauty. The camera work is, at times, breath-taking. The intense angles, slow pans and editing techniques all contribute to the films art. I still adore the opening shot in which Alex and his fellow Droogies are in the milk bar, the zoom out being perfectly executed whilst being accompanied to the futuristic music and surrounded by set- design which is different and mind-dazzlingly brilliant. Jonathon Ross (not known for being the best film critic admittedly) described the film as ""mind-searingly brilliant"" and I couldn't agree more...<br/><br/>Not only is the film superb, we also have one of the best acting performances seen in British film, and arguably of all film. Malcom McDowell throws everything into his portrayal of the devilish Alex DeLarge. Alex is wrong, twisted and darkly close to being the true devil. However McDowell manages to somehow draw in feelings of sorrow towards him as he goes through the torment of experimentation and its aftermath. As an actor, he had to go through a hell of a lot. Being stuck in a straight-jacket whilst having his eye-lids locked which had to be constantly moistened by water eye drops (resulting in his eye being scratched and temporarily blinded), being held under water for what seemed an eternity, raping a women whilst seemingly being overjoyed and singing his heart out and other moments where his acting credentials were being harshly tested. He passed every single one and pulled off a magnificent performance, shaping the intriguing character that is Alex. <br/><br/>A film of artistic brilliance, poignant messages on anarchy and crime soaring, state control over individuals and of the human soul, the film holds so many qualities that it really does boggle the mind. It's too much to take in on one viewing and after each one, you realise just how powerful, relevant and bewildering that A Clockwork Orange really is, coming from a film-maker whose vision is always played out on screen to near perfection, the sign of a truly great director whose come out on top with this legendary film."

","To inform you, I gave A Clockwork Orange a view about a year ago, I didn't like it. In fact I only watched twenty minutes, my view towards all the sex and violence turned me off the movie completely. I just recently gave it a watch again, looking into the movie seeing the message it sends and how music and words can be so vital. A Clockwork Orange is beautiful. A fantastic movie that has all important key society elements transferred and directed by the famous Stanley Kubrick. Like 2001, the movie is set in the future and Kubrick along with the fantastic performance by Malcolm McDowell gives us a imaginative look on punishment and science. A Clockwork Orange is something very special, the sets, the acting, the violence and the disturbing scenes make it all into one fine movie."

","What to say about Clockwork Orange?There isn't really so much to say because it's reputation speak's for it self.And i can say that it's justified on that matter.This movie is just great.It's excellent.Direction and production are at maximum in this film.I wont even speak about acting.Malcolm McDowell portrayed one of the most sealed character's in the history of movies in this film.If you watch new Batman,The Dark Knight you can clearly see that Heath,even though his acting was superb,based his way of acting The Joker on Malcolm McDowell's Alex.Don't get me wrong,i'm not saying that McDowell acted Alex better then Heath Ledger did the Joker,he probably didn't but Alex from Clockwork orange is a cult character.McDowell had no one to look by when he was acting in this movie while Heath did.Even though he looked after McDowell,it don't means that it made it easier for him.It just helped him in the way of imagination because he didn't have to figure out the entire character's behavior for him self.Enough about McDowell and his character,let's talk about Kubrick.Stanley Kubrick is one of the best,most admirable director's ever.Not only that he made one masterpiece but he made them plenty.Too bad he died,i'm sure he had many more trick's in his hat to show which would come in handy to the other director's and entire Hollywood.<br/><br/>He was a true master.There are classic movies and there are classic figures of film makers.He is between those on the top.There is nothing bad in his movies.For example...If you take a look at his other movies an especially Full Metal Jacket you will see that no matter what the story is,he never takes the political sides.His movies and him self are independent!!!Period!!!That's why his movies are for everyone.No matter are you English,Scotish,Irish,American,Russian,French,Croatian,Serbian or anyone else,his movies will not insult your nation's history in any way.<br/><br/>I wont say anything else except that Clockwork Orange is a masterpiece that will be loved through generation's.A work of a master director.Watch it under any price.No matter what anyone says he/she can't explain the originality and brilliance of this movie.No word's can't!An if someone says to you that it's a bad movie,don't listen to him because he is lying!!!!!!!!!"
"BJJManchester","9","1","3","26 November 2008"," Maybe The Greatest Dystopian Satire Committed to Film
","One of the most controversial and talked about films ever made,Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of Anthony Burgess' novel A CLOCKWORK ORANGE was unavailable for decades after Kubrick withdrew it from public view in the light of threats against him and his family,and alleged copycat attacks in the UK related to those featured in his film.It was only after Kubrick's death in 1999 that the film was released again in public.Reaction at the time of this release was a little patchy;admiring Kubrick's cinematic skill while being critical of stereotypical characterisation.A further decade on,with frequent stories of indiscriminate youth violence and the development of a 'Chav' culture in Britain,A CLOCKWORK ORANGE now seems more relevant and often devastatingly prescient than it ever did,and it helps that it is flawlessly designed,produced and photographed,all brilliantly marshaled by one of world cinema's greatest helmsmen at it's centre.<br/><br/>The story of Alex (Malcolm McDowell) and his droogs,a vicious,ruthless gang of hoodlums whose only aim in life is to get gratuitous enjoyment out of committing copious acts of 'ultra-violence',they beat up an Irish tramp (Paul Farrell),and commit further heinous assaults on a writer (Patrick Magee) and his wife (Adrienne Corri),who is also raped.Alex is eventually caught after beating a so-called 'Catwoman' (Miriam Karlin) to death with a giant-sized phallus.He agrees to take part in a course of government supported aversion therapy whilst in prison (which renders him incapable of violence),but after he is given early release,he finds various former foes and friends alike more than ready to exploit his new disposition,and enact on him the kind of brutality he inflicted on them before his treatment.<br/><br/>The violence depicted in A CLOCKWORK ORANGE inevitably does not come across as shocking as it was when first released,being very stylised and not particularly bloody,but still comes across as very disturbing as Kubrick films it in such a way as to provide a combination of revulsion and laughter (as when Alex performs ""Singin' In The Rain"" while attacking the writer and his wife) making the whole experience very unsettling.The script itself is equally stylised,being a combination of English and Nadsat patois that author Burgess invented and used in the original novel,with profanities kept down to a minimum. This kind of device works better on the printed page,and in less skilled hands on film would seem decidedly foolish,but it works amazingly well here,with the various words used in Nadsat spoken in a way that you could easily understand the literal meaning.This is one of the many aspects of the film that are fascinatingly prophetic.In the years since,violent youth gangs have been springing up in ever larger numbers in Britain's inner cities,dominated as they are by acres of brutally functional,soulless council housing,perhaps more so in the 21st century.Many have themselves developed particular street slang,designed to confuse and keep outsiders at bay,a distinctive way of dressing (represented here with Alex and his droogs wearing bowler hats,plain white shirts and trousers,with the addition of a jockstrap!),a partiality to drugs and alcohol (expressed in the film via the Korova milk bar),and an obsession with music (Alex's idol is Beethoven).Kubrick perhaps himself didn't think of such forebodings at the time,but much of what is portrayed is all too apposite in contemporary times.<br/><br/>Not much expense was provided in actual production (the only major design was apparently the aforementioned milk bar),and in spite of decidedly prosaic-seeming outdoor and indoor locations,Kubrick incredibly makes it look as though it has a far larger budget,thanks to stylish camera movements,impeccably judged lighting,cleverly chosen examples of pop art,and moments of peerless bravura direction.Perhaps the most memorable archetype of this is when Alex and his droogs walk alongside the artificial lake at Thamesmead.Both the location and point of the sequence itself couldn't be more ordinary and humdrum if it tried,but filmed in ultra-slow motion,accompanied to the strains of Rossini's ""Thieving Magpie"",is transformed into an extraordinarily balletic,unforgettable piece of cinema by Kubrick at his most dazzlingly creative best.<br/><br/>The film perhaps falters slightly in it's second half while Alex resides in jail and goes through his aversion treatment (Burgess' main satirical point here was his considerable dislike of behaviourism techniques),lacking the ferocious nihilism of previous scenes,but is still absorbing nevertheless.What Burgess tried to state in his novel was that most young men with violent,aggressive tendencies do mature and grow out of such bearing when that difficult teenage hormonal period takes it's natural course.Burgess' novel ends on this relatively sedate note of development.Kubrick however chooses to end the film with the previous chapter,which suggests that Alex is reverting to his old ways.(Kubrick was not necessarily to blame for this;the American version of Burgess' novel did not publish the original,more optimistic final chapter)<br/><br/>The film itself is dominated by Malcolm McDowell.Despite his shameless disregard for the slightest bit of decency,McDowell often makes his character likable,if not intelligent (thanks to his appreciation of classical music),and oddly sympathetic after his medical manipulation in prison leaves him meek,impotent and hapless. The supporting actors tend to take more of a back seat,but Anthony Sharp (as a scheming government minister),and a young Warren Clarke (before he became a big name on UK television) stand out.Michael Bates (as a voluble prison warder) and Patrick Magee go a little over the top,but perhaps this was deliberate,part of the film's constant savage satire and jet black humour,perhaps even more abundant than Kubrick's nightmare doomsday essay DR.STRANGELOVE of eight years earlier.Kubrick was always deeply cynical of establishment figures,and eventually seems more sympathetic to the plight of the exploited Alex than his supposed law-abiding superiors.<br/><br/>Disturbing,perhaps repellent,often ambiguous,but endlessly thoughtful,philosophic and astute,A CLOCKWORK ORANGE could be regarded as the most outstanding dystopian invective ever filmed.Technically outstanding and flawless,with sumptously well-designated music attached,it has perhaps more relevance to this day and age than when first released.The talents of a World-Class filmmaker and novelist combined don't always produce the goods,but A CLOCKWORK ORANGE is wholly worth any eulogy of it's immense quality.<br/><br/>RATING:8 and a half out of 10."

","In four words: I am blown away!<br/><br/>In few sentences: I saw this movie about a week ago and it has not leaved my mind yet – still I remember that sense of humor packed in this masterpiece titled A Clockwork Orange, as well as English + Russian jargon and brilliant work of Kubrick and the story too, of course.<br/><br/>In fact, I have only seen two of Kubrick’s films – first one was The Shining and I immediately fell in love how this master treats the lighting, camera angles, camera in general, actors and crew – pure eye-candy! An as well as in Shining – here we have brilliant story packed with Kubrik’s talent – deadly orgasmic combination of pleasures of cinematography and story-telling. In fact – the only thing that reminded me about the age of this film was the outfit of characters and sound design. But in all of the rest planes – one with classicism in heart could create this movie just yesterday.<br/><br/>This movie sure does generate the urge to see more films from Kubrick, if not all of them. Also it generates the urge to read the novel!<br/><br/>Very beautiful movie, will seek the moment to watch it again!"

","This is my all-time #1 movie.<br/><br/>I read the book back when I was in high school. I spoke the ""language"" quite well, which perplexed most of my friends.

Even my dad thought it was a great movie! We watched it several times, and quoted it often.<br/><br/>There is no easy way to explain why this movie is so good. You just get enveloped by the concept after you make it through the disturbing violence that turned so many people off back then. By today's standards, it's quite mild. (That which is left to the imagination, can be more disturbing than anything presented in vivid color.) Nothing compared to this then, and nothing will ever compare to it again. There was a time when you could not get this video in the UK.

","""A Clockwork Orange"" is about young rebellious Alex and his gang of thugs who go around and terrorize the town. He is apprehended and subjected to a 'test procedure' that will cure him of his animal instincts.<br/><br/>Now cured, Alex is released to a society that he once degraded, and who now degrades him. He cannot fight back because of the procedure that was done to him, and it serves as poetic justice to a person who caused so much damage.<br/><br/>This movie is critically acclaimed and with good reason. Stanley Kubrick was one of the best directors of our time, and he delivered a top-notch sci-fi movie that's also filled with his political and social undertones (such as the 'morals' of society and how by eliminating the animal urges people have can make them a perfect person). McDowell did a fantastic job, and overall the film is exceptional (the music, the scenery, the acting...everything). Kubrick definitely delivered a classic in ""Clockwork Orange."""
"pgear83","10","1","3","5 July 2008"," Marginally Kubrick's Best
","Originally a novella by Anthony Burgess, one that emerged from the same British dystopian tradition that had previously given us Brave New World and 1984, the film is an adaptation that is mostly faithful to the book in terms of plot, but also is very distinctly Kubrick in its visual style. The imagery is surreal, bizarre and frighteningly entertaining, given the often disturbing subject matter.<br/><br/>Malcolm McDowell plays Alex Delarge a (supposedly 15-year-old, according to the book) sociopath who spends his nights terrorizing the British public of the near future, along with his droogs (meaning friends, but in a subordinate way). The film includes the use of the 'Nadsat' slang that was the defining feature of the book and is sort of a hoodlum dialect composed of Russian words, cockneyed English and slang from both languages). Alex and the droogs engage in a choreographed street battle with a rival gang set to Rossini's 'The Thieving Magpie' before assaulting an elderly couple while singing show tunes. After a series of shenanigans, including a high-speed orgy set to the William Tell Overture, Alex murders a woman during a robbery and is arrested. After two years in prison, the nearly totalitarian state attempts to reform Alex using a form of brainwashing known as the Ludovico technique.<br/><br/>As vile as Alex and the droogs are, we are aware that their society is almost as bad. This world is full of gaudy pop-art, run-down housing and there is not a single character we are meant to sympathize with in the first third of the film. Alex's parole officer P.R. Deltoid (Aubrey Morris) is particularly sleazy, only concerned with 'reclaiming' delinquents to benefit his own professional prestige. His position is clearly meant to create the appearance that the state is doing something about crime; in other words for public relations, hence his initials P.R. Alex's last victim is a nasty elitist who warns him: ""I'll teach you to break into real people's houses!"" In addition, we learn later that even Alex's parents are so shallow that they quickly find a replacement son once he is sent to prison. This is not to excuse the behavior of Alex; this character is absolutely reprehensible with not one redeeming quality. But because of the magnetism of McDowell, we willingly go along for the ride with him.<br/><br/>As for the most famous part of the film, the brainwashing sequence, it is for one thing a brilliant satire of the will-sapping, mind-numbing power of the mainstream media. On a more literal level, it is an exercise in aversive therapy: Alex is conditioned against violence, sex and even his other love, the music of Beethoven, by being made to suffer in their presence. This brings about the central philosophical question posed by the story: if one cannot choose between good and evil, then what value do they even have? The prison chaplain (the only remotely sympathetic character in the film) poses these questions, but the government dismisses such thinking as mere ""subtleties."" Of course, even in real life this is a moot point to some. The Ludovico technique, if realized, would be a profound example of applied behaviorism. A hardcore behaviorist like B.F. Skinner (a man both fascinating and creepy) would likely approve of this brainwashing as a means of control. Since Skinner considered human beings to be nothing more than complicated machines (clockworks, if you will) the issue of freedom of choice is meaningless, as free will is an illusion. By this thinking, we are only the products of a series of chemical reactions and we do not choose to do anything, any more than an ice cube chooses to melt.<br/><br/>If Dr. Strangelove and 2001 were about technology that slips out of human control in the accomplishment of its human-directed tasks, then A Clockwork Orange is about the danger of technology being used to directly control humans. In the age, of pre-emptive wars and terrorism-induced paranoia, both these ideas are still frighteningly relevant. We must never give into the temptation to ""sell liberty for a quieter life."" <br/><br/>Finally, A Clockwork Orange, is a rare adaptation that is, in the opinion of many, actually an improvement on the source material. Certainly, Kubrick did very well to remove Burgess' cop-out ending, the gravest flaw in that otherwise great book. On the other hand, Kurt Vonnegut used this book and movie as an example of the superiority of words to film, saying ""there can be only one Clockwork Orange by Stanley Kubrick. There are tens of thousands of Clockwork Oranges by Anthony Burgess, since every reader has to cast, costume, direct, and design the show in his head. The big trouble with print, of course, is that it is an elitist art form. Most people can't read very well."" So while this movie is just one of many interpretations of a single novel, there is no denying that it is a great, if hugely controversial, one. It clicked with me instantly and upon seeing the final image and hearing the final words I was immediately aware that I had experienced something unique and incredible."
"Gunnar_Runar_Ingibjargarson","8","1","3","19 June 2008"," Check this one, what a movie!
","Stanley Kubrick's striking visual interpretation of Anthony Burgess's famous novel is a masterpiece. Malcolm McDowell delivers a clever, tongue-in-cheek performance as Alex, the leader of a quartet of drools, a vicious group of young hoodlums who spend their nights stealing cars, fighting rival gangs, breaking into people's homes, and raping women. While other directors would simply exploit the violent elements of such a film without subtext, Kubrick maintains Burgess's dark, satirical social commentary. We watch Alex transform from a free-roaming miscreant into a convict used in a government experiment that attempts to reform criminals through an unorthodox new medical treatment. The catch, of course, is that this therapy may be nothing better than a quick cure-all for a society plagued by rampant crime. A Clockwork Orange works on many levels--visual, social, political, and sexual--and is one of the few films that hold up under repeated viewings. Kubrick not only presents colorfully arresting images, he also stylizes the film by utilizing classical music (and Wendy Carlos's electronic classical work) to underscore the violent scenes, which even today are disturbing in their display of sheer nihilism. Ironically, many fans of the film have missed that point, sadly being entertained by its brutality rather than being repulsed by it."
"ladyvalencia43","8","1","3","31 May 2008"," ""Clockworck Orange"", good movie!!!
","Clockwork Orange is a movie deals with very futurist and polemic subjects, that makes it interesting and different than other movies presented in the past century. Right now is investigated the following version for antisocial conducts : ""Many people can not control their emotions, especially about someone else's pain, because their brain has not that capacity for its morphological structure"". From ethical point of view, the psychological manipulation like treatment for criminal people is very cruel and its effects are very harmful for the people emotional stability, the cruelty can not be combatted with more cruelty, that is ironic and the brain of people can not be an laboratory mouse for people with political, scientific or other interests. Definitively""Clockwork Orange"" is a good movie."

","The movie has a funny way to show us the consequences of all our acts in our life, it does not care if they are good or bad.<br/><br/>I think the movie was very amazing, because it criticizes many aspects of society.For example, when it show us how the Alex's former friends (vandalic men) become police officers. It is a clear critic to a society where the powerful people use his power for personal benefits, and how this people have no merits to get high positions in the system.<br/><br/>The brutal methods from society to get well behavior human beings are not effective. The education and the conscience in each of us is the only way."

","It's not hard to me say something about this movie first of all, the apprenticeship that you can get about this kind of movies isn't comparable with other movies that you can watch today When you are younger isn't easy keep the control of your own ideas. Every time you're influenced bye the mass media and they can affect your way of act with the social environments. One of the most important things is the kind of film, the way of pass on ideas to the watchers easily, and the language of the actors, make that movie stays on time every time you watch it. But it movie don't have a message only, this can transmit several messages that you have to interpret, depending of the influence that the government politics and the society have made on you. Thanks GEYDEN."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","10","1","3","18 February 2008"," Visionary, timeless and an incredible example of how film can matter.
","Stanley Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange"" will disturb you, bother you, probe you, intrigue you and confuse you to no end. It is abusive in its use of human vice as a means of showing society at its worst. But while it's hard to take, Kubrick's science-fiction social commentary is simply one of the best examples of how film can tell stories and make valuable points in ways that other media simply can't.<br/><br/>The film takes place in a future Britain, which Kubrick portrays with a retro-'60s twist that only makes sense for someone envisioning the not-too-distant future from 1970. The main character is Alex, a teenager living a lifestyle of pure anarchy, focused on excessive violence, or ""ultraviolence"" as he an his cronies coin it. It's a gang culture and Alex believes in it, that is until his ""brothers"" set him up and get him caught and stuck in prison, where he makes an effort to get selected for a special treatment that is said to cure him of his evil ways and allow him to go back into the world immediately despite his prison sentence. The result is by far more ethically questionable than Alex's previous actions and Alex finds himself as the poster boy for an attack on the government.<br/><br/>Kubrick's depiction of this dark and dangerous world is never without distinct purpose. Every scene is memorable, every camera angle or movement significant in some way or contributing to the mood of the film. The use of classical music both as an element of the film and as a major part of the plot is absolute genius. Music, especially Beethoven, seemingly the most harmless aspect of a stained character in Alex, becomes the most influential in the film and also is Kubrick playing the same trick on us as gets played on Alex.<br/><br/>Malcolm McDowell as the eerie and controversial ""protagonist"" steals most of the acting thunder. After all, he is the narrator, but this is without question a work that feels dominated most by the ubiquitous presence of its director. He even went out of his way to create inconsistencies in the film's continuity.<br/><br/>Kubrick explores the very indecipherable nature of both good and evil and how it is conditioned in society. The film also serves as a critique of higher establishment, specifically government, telling people how they are supposed to live, though ironically a minister seems to offer some thematic advice in saying that all men have choice to be good or evil. <br/><br/>""Orange"" is the kind of film that has many layers that can be visited and revisited. Its science-fiction element makes it timeless as well - we can always ponder its questions about the future. Ultimately, however, no matter how much access you have or think you have into the film's insights, it still leaves an impression. There are so many memorable scenes and while most of those might be difficult to watch, they're deeply affecting and fascinating. The combination of visuals, music and ideas simply shows film's great contribution to thought and social ideas.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site http://moviemusereviews.com"
"myrockintoe","9","1","3","9 January 2008"," Beethoven in Clockwork Orange originally written to Pedro from the UK
","I recently watched a Clockwork Orange and then read your review on it. Let me tell you first, it is people like you that kept geniuses in poverty.<br/><br/>The reason that I was looking through reviews in the first place was to find the significance of Beethoven in the movie and book--yes, if you did not know before, let me inform you now that A Clockwork Orange was original a novel by Anthony Burgess and we students all know about tedious readings such as this one where every word is filled with much more significance than it seems. The first thing that you wrote in your review that indicated that you were merely writing this to compensate for something like intelligence or ingenuity was when you wrote ""Many scenes are quite revolting - and bizarrely they are even found revolting by some of the people who rate the movie highly!"" and then indicated that revolting scenes had the purpose neither to educate or entertain.<br/><br/>I see the grotesqueness of the movie with one of two possible purposes. To educate or to provoke emotion and thought. Many of artists have created things not to inspire beauty but to inspire ugliness. For instance, Berlioz's famous fifth movement of his Symphony Fantastique. Throughout the piece he is warping a single theme. In the fifth movement it has warped into ugliness--he pairs bassoons with tubas, has the strings play below the bridge. He is making the instrumentalists play ugliness to provoke a sense of ugliness. People criticized this, but let me ask, why does all art have to inspire beauty? Why should it not inspire other adjectives. This movie does exactly that, it doesn't inspire beauty as you want it to--which is why you call it revolting--it inspires grotesqueness.<br/><br/>Let me now introduce myself a little further. I am a music major at Smith College, sister school to Yale University. Beethoven is by far one the most brilliant men to walk the earth. My speculations as to why he and his music were so important in this film, I might say this because you did not answer the question that I sought to answer, are as follows.<br/><br/>Some say that Beethoven single handedly brought in the Romantic period of music--a period where composers composed abstract ideas. Take Berlioz's Symphony Fantastique. This is pure romanticism. He wrote an entire symphony--and a gorgeous one at that--based of being high on opium and the feelings and emotions that the experience evoked. If Beethoven had not happened, I question whether such beauties as Prokofiev's Peter and the Wolf, Stravinsky's Rite of Spring, Bizet's Carmen or Copland's Rodeo would have been able to happen either. Perhaps you are starting to see Beethoven's significance to the musical world now.<br/><br/>Beethoven's ninth and last symphony is considered an Ode to a Revolution. Mind you while writing this masterpiece he was completely deaf. Now don't mistake me, I am not writing this because I am entirely in love with Beethoven or his ninth. Out of all his symphonies I love his sixth the greatest and I must say that I am a Mozartian at heart. But any true music buff will acknowledge the amazing significance that Beethoven had on this world. Therefore, playing his ninth continually throughout A Clockwork Orange cannot be random or meaningless.<br/><br/>In the scene of Alex's demonstration, static rennaissance music is playing in the background. This leads me to believe that Beethoven's ninth, being a revolutionary piece, stands for the natural tendencies and urges--violence and sex--of humanity. For when it is playing, Alex is thinking about or actually preforming acts of violence and sex. Another time it is played is when other people are preforming acts of violence or torture. The renaissance music earlier is maybe to indicate the old, common ways of music--using the preBach ways of writing music."
"madalina_roca","8","1","3","19 December 2007"," man as a machine
","The movie deals with the human mind, the pervert man, brutal, violent, atrocious but free and the 'good man', the man seen as a plant, as a manipulated object, without free will. The world may be violent and horrible but still, a world full of plain, smiling, good people would be worse. Man is both good and evil, thats the beauty of humanity, that's the thing that brings color to life. The movie mocks at the government, the supreme control organ that manipulates the human mind under the pretext of doing something good for the society. The use of music in the violent scenes is not comic, Kubrick deals with music just like David Lynch does. The music is dangerous because itţs an extension of the characterţs inner self."
"stefanbe","10","1","3","16 November 2007"," A disturbing, yet poignant film that only Kubrick could of directed.
","Stanley Kubrick was a filmmaker who continually tried to both shock and amaze his audience, but most importantly he wanted people to come back again and again to unlock the layers of secrets hidden beneath his films. Plenty has been told regarding the impact of his A Clockwork Orange upon its original release, yet even looking at the film in it's own terms, it's easy to see why it's regarded as such a masterpiece. Kubrick adapted Anthony Burgess's equally brilliant book rather faithfully, but still giving the film his own mark. His films have been criticised for being cold and heartless, yet it's almost necessary for A Clockwork Orange to be filmed in such a style. Kubrick portrays his near-future as bleak and lacking the Utopian feel that most science-fiction writers were predicting. Reading the headlines in today's newspaper, the futuristic world depicted in A Clockwork Orange has unfortunately come true. This goes both for the portrayal of youthful aggression as well as the government's attempts to rid the world of it.<br/><br/>Teenage violence at its worst is personified in the lead character of A Clockwork Orange, Alex DeLarge (Malcolm McDowell). Alex is a parent's worst nightmare: He is cruel, violent, cold-blooded, but filled with intelligence, which he unfortunately does not put to better use. Alex romps around town with his gang of ""droogs"", raping and hurting innocent individuals just for the fun of it. One of the most disturbing (of many) sequences in the film is the scene in which is rapes a writer's wife while dancing and skipping along to ""Singin' in the Rain."" A seemingly innocent song about love is used in a means completely the opposite of its original intention, thus why it's such a disturbing part of the film. What's even worse is Alex knows that what he is doing is wrong, but his lack of conscience causes him to not care what society thinks of him and his ideas of fun. Kubrick's uncanny ability to seemingly combine beautiful classical music to a montage of horrifying comes into play in A Clockwork Orange, with Alex's admiration towards the works of ""Ludwig van."" Beethoven Ninth Symphony is turned from a wonderful piece of music to something particularly saddening as we learn how much this sadistic rapist obsesses over it and ""As I slooshied, I knew such lovely pictures!"" These so-called ""lovely pictures"" which contain such R-rated material as rape, violence and blood pouring out of Alex's fangs would probably scare Beethoven due to the way Kubrick so perfectly edits the images together.<br/><br/>Yet, there comes an interesting turn-around when Alex is arrested and sent to prison. Soon afterwards, the tone of the film completely changes as Alex begins to play nice and the film becomes far less disturbing and chaotic than the first act was. Alex wants to get back out into the world as quickly as possible and when he hears of a technique that will help him do so, he jumps to the chance. He is soon put in the Ludovico Technique, involving him being strapped to a chair, his eyes made un-shutable and forced to watch horrible acts of violence on a cinema screen. When Alex's beloved Ninth Symphony begins playing over images of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party, it is then that the effects take hold. Even Alex of all people realises that he is an amateur compared to the atrocities the Nazis performed during the Holocaust. This leads to an effect more cruel than the Technique's creators possibly imagined: Not only is Alex drained of violence, but also of his love of fabulous music. Maybe Beethoven heaves a sigh of relief, but us the viewer is oddly starting to feel sorry for Alex. He may be unable to commit violent acts, but he is also unable to choose whether he wants to or not.<br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick launches on these themes perfectly as only he can. Other filmmakers would probably none too subtly through these into the viewer's face, but not Kubrick. Like many of his other films, he allows to slowly tear apart the film throughout multiple viewings and even let us interpret the film's views ourselves without him interfering. He just sits, stroking his beard and thinking ""yes, that seems about right. What else do you have to say regarding the film?"" Malcolm McDowell's performance also brings us into Alex's world, carefully pronouncing each word that Burgess created for his book so as not to make any mistake. Each subsequent viewing, we learn a new meaning for ""nadsat"" and see that it is more than just the way Alex communicates, but also a part of his rebellion against the world he tolerates so much of. Stanley Kubrick not only created a masterpiece worthy of plenty of conversation, but also a look at our world currently operates and ways we can resolve these problems without the need of brainwashing techniques."
"bambilola90","10","1","3","30 October 2007"," A Clockwork Orange - cinematic masterpiece
","based on the 1968 novel by Anthony Burgess, A Clockwork Orange is a thrilling dark piece of cinema set in a dystopian future. Alex De Large (Malcolm McDowell) finds euphoria in drinking spiked milk in the Korova milk bar, leading his pack of droogs on ventures of ultra-violence and listening to Beethovens ninth. At the beginning of the film, he seems to epitomize evil. Whether it is his seemingly innocent blue eyes and cheeky side grin, that he refers to the viewer as ""Oh my brother"" and himself as ""Your humble narrator"" or the fact that he exudes optimism, charm and charisma, you inevitably end up batting for him and feeling your heart strings pull on his behalf. Through a twist of treachery from his unsatisfied droogs, Alex finds himself at the opposite end of the 'tolchoking' and in jail, where he hears of a new treatment that gets prisoners out of jail earlier. this is where the meaning of the story really comes in, the fragility of the individual. as Alex is being brainwashed, you can't help but feel his sickness as his face convulses with pain and horror. The strange language called Nadsat(meaning 'teenager' in Russian) coined by Anthony Burgess is endearing and Malcolm Macdowell plays the role of Alex with all of his heart, inhabiting the character of Alex rather than acting him, something few actors bother doing nowadays. A Clockwork Orange is stunning in every aspect, visually with the genius of Kubrick and the skills of Macdowell, Aurally with the sounds of Beethoven and other classics and a haunting Moog soundtrack that plays in the most crucial roles and really sets the dark scenes.<br/><br/>A Clockwork Orange is a piece of cinematic masterpiece. from beginning to end, it is like watching an emotional, often comedic, realistically (too much so) acted piece of wonderful wonderful art. be careful before you watch this film, it is utterly heart wrenching and will stay with you for the rest of your lives."
"Longest_Lasting_Redshirt","10","1","3","29 October 2007"," an essential to cinema and Kubrick
","my favorite Kubrick is either Dr. Strangelove and A Clockwork Orange. He is a master of cinema (one of my three favorite directors) his movies are more intense and extreme that most other directors. That is part of why they are so good, and this is no exception.Lets look at the good elements: Directing: its like each scene is its own priceless sculpture. The most interesting shot is of Alex jumping off the roof and the camera is eye point of view. My dad and I think (and most likely it did happen) that Kubrick lost a camera there(the thing that makes me doubt that is its 2 million dollar budget, even low for back then).<br/><br/>acting: the actors were brilliant in every level. Malcolm McDowell was and sympathetics and devious at points.<br/><br/>Writing: There was great slang created by the books author that any other writer/director would not have used and I was feeling sorry for a kid who killed! need I go on? Set and costume design: my personal favorite element of the film. The costumes of Alex and his ""droogs"" were well done. The sets were so interesting that it's hard to believe they were location <br/><br/>Music: its another of Kubricks award deserving use of music. classical that he nailed.<br/><br/>In conclusion it is a flawless film.

","Having first heard about the film back in high school, for some reason I never got around to seeing it. Partially it was my uncertainty to what I was told was in the film that kept me away. What I now find myself asking is, ""Why didn't I see this sooner?"" It didn't hurt that the actor portraying Alex (Malcolm McDowell) is quite an attractive & talented man. The story hit upon things that make sense to me, the love of music being one aspect (the inclusion of classical, though played with synthesizers, was befitting for the overall feel of the film). I can sort of understand the character of Alex acting the way he does, and how he was treated upon his release back into society. I personally had no problems with the playful aspect of the William Tell Overture scene, even the cheeky foreplay at the music store (which was the Chelsea Drug Store). However unwanted the violation & violence are, they are necessary to the storyline. I adore the satire, and understand what Stanley Kubrick was shining the spotlight on: how twisted society is, and how normal we believe we are. -Monday, 22 October, 2007-"
"BobStage","9","1","3","20 October 2007"," This is one of the best Kubrick films I have seen yet.
","""A Clockwork Orange"" was always a book and a movie that were both forbidden due to extreme violence and coarse matter. Like any young guy, I acquired an interest to see it one day.<br/><br/>So now, as a teen, I can say that I have read the book, and also seen the movie. The book is one of the best novels I have read yet. It is amazing how foresighted and smart Anthony Burgess was in making such a book. Then, who decides to make it a movie? Stanley Kubrick. I had seen some of his other films, and I was eager to see ""A Clockwork Orange"".<br/><br/>The film is a very good film, most especially thanks to the talented Malcolm MacDowell, the directing skills of Kubrick, and the story itself.<br/><br/>Malcolm gives such an amazing act as the villainous youth Alex de Large, who is a youth in a futuristic England, where hoods and teens rule the night streets with a savage immorality. Rape, violence, and rebellion are the order of the day, and Alex loves it. Then he is apprehended by the police, and his journey leads him to a dreadful new experiment. I would have to say that I could not imagine anyone apart from Ewan Macgregor (TRAINSPOTTING) that could even match to the stunning, Oscar-worthy performance of MacDowell.<br/><br/>Kubrick is a very good director, who ranks alongside Oliver Stone and Martin Scorsese as my three favourite directors. His films inspire thought, interest, and entertainment. His methods of direction truly pay off in this adaptation to ""A Clockwork Orange"". It's a pity that he was soon to be despised as a reclusive pervert from this film. He did an amazing job, and I admire him for it.<br/><br/>Finally, the last but not least credit must go to the cleverness of the original creator of ""A Clockwork Orange"". Burgess' novel is wonderful, and for the most part, the movie takes the ideas of the novel correctly. One error would have to be the cutting of Burgess' original novel, but that is not Kubrick's fault, as the American version of the novel is made that way. It would have been nice to see the original ending in the novel, but this is a minor complaint.<br/><br/>This movie really appeals to youth, and it is a great movie to see. If I had to pick the best films of Kubrick's career, I would hail ""Eyes Wide Shut"", ""Barry Lyndon"", and ""A Clockwork Orange"" as the best films he ever made. Thank you Kubrick, thank you MacDowell, and thank you Burgess, for the genius that is ""A Clockwork Orange""."

","A Clockwork Orange (1971)<br/><br/>Number 1 - 1971 <br/><br/>Top 10 - 1970s <br/><br/>Top 50 - All Time <br/><br/>This satirical sci-fi masterpiece featuring the charismatic and psychopathic delinquent Alex de Large (in a tour de force performance by Malcolm McDowell) whose prime interests are classical music rape and ultra violence. A Clockwork Orange features disturbing and violent imagery to facilitate social commentary issues ranging from psychiatry, youth gangs, and other topics in a futuristic dystopian Britain. The film is visually enticing, acoustically beautiful and magnificently directed by Kubrick who should have been awarded a Best Director Oscar for his simple yet bravura direction of the film.<br/><br/>A Clockwork Orange can be assessed on so many different levels. There are several reasons why this film is awarded a five star rating, so many reasons why it reigns on many critics' top lists and even today more than three decades later, it is an undeniably popular film with a cult status.<br/><br/>I find it to be an extremely bizarre film made by an eccentric director. I appreciate and savour the film's fine elements such as the beautiful soundtrack featuring Beethoven's 9th Symphony over disturbing rape scenes and other scenes of various vulgarities. The film's direction, sets and costumes create a feeling of a dystopia, which is what England is supposed to be; a country where the government maintains a firm grasp over its citizens.<br/><br/>Kubrick's creation of Alex de Large, played with ruthless efficiency by Malcolm McDowell is an obscene cinematic creation. One of the most sadistic, violent, twisted , disturbed characters in motion picture history; yet Kubrick presents Alex, his protégé in this film, in such a manner that although Alex commits such atrocities, Stanley Kubrick manages to maintain a feeling of a strange compassion towards him; no not compassion that is the wrong word; rather we do not hate the character because he is the hero of the film, or rather the Anti-hero.<br/><br/>The film which is a perfect exercise in beautiful, visual film-making is firstly a great impact on the psyche and on an emotional level the film gets under you skin - just for that the film is a masterpiece. A theme in the film is a question of morality and the definitions of good and evil; can good be manufactured or reinforced through psychological therapy? For example after the aversion therapy, Alex behaves like a good member of society, but not by choice; his ""goodness"" is involuntary and mechanical, like that of the title: A clockwork orange. In prison, the chaplain criticises the Ludovico Technique, saying that true goodness must come from within. Another theme is the abuse of one's liberties – both by Alex and by those using him for their various ends. The film is also severely critical of behavioural psychology as propounded by Watson and Skinner, a perspective that human behaviour is entirely moulded by social/environmental factors. Such theories were popular from the 1940s to the 1960s. Burgess disapproved of behaviourism calling Skinner's most popular book 'Beyond Freedom and Dignity' as ""one of the most dangerous book ever written"". Skinner argued that behaviour modification is the key to an ideal society. The Ludovico treatment used on Alex is reminiscent of the Project MK-ULTRA, the covert CIA mind-control and chemical interrogation research program, run by the Office of Scientific Intelligence. The program began in the early 1950s, continuing at least through the late 1960s, and it used United States citizens as its test subjects. The published evidence indicates that Project MK-ULTRA involved the surreptitious use of many types of drugs, as well as other methods, to manipulate individual mental states and to alter brain function. <br/><br/>A Clockwork Orange is one of the most cinematically pounding, visually enthralling landmarks in cinema and one of Kubrick's finest achievements.<br/><br/>10/10"
"Skippy001","10","1","3","27 August 2007"," Oh my brothers...what a film!
","Twenty-five years on from its release, A Clockwork Orange has lost none of its power to shock and outrage. In this near-future setting the outlets for teenage enthusiasm are few and far between. Disenchanted, youths form ritualistic gangs, fight battles and engage in vandalism. Alex DeLarge (Malcolm McDowell) is the leader of just such a group, marked out by their preferences for phallic masks and boiler suits.<br/><br/>His select followers (known as droogs) are Dim (Warren Clark), Georgie (James Marcus) and Pete (Michael Tarn). On a typical evening they'll stop by the Korova for some milk-plus, to sharpen them up, before venturing into the urban jungle. On this particular night they don't have to travel far for a spot of ""ultraviolence""; a rival gang are about to force a bit of the ""old in-out"" on a helpless young devotchka (girl). For the pure love of violence they decimate their rivals.<br/><br/>The element which elevates A Clockwork Orange above similar films is its bizarre juxtaposition of music (often classical) with violence. Images and sound pull in different directions, stimulating conflicting emotions (as Kubrick no doubt intended). On top of this, the profusion of erotic symbols forms a not very subtle subtext, taking in everything from the objet d'art murder weapon to the feverish coupling of medical staff. Kubrick filters all of this through camera trickery (slow-motion, unusual angles, fish-eye lens etc), heightening rather than subduing emotion. It's easy to see why A Clockwork Orange has divided critics - it's extremely graphic and unsettling...but its still a masterpiece film that deserves praise and admiration."
"filmviewer64","10","1","3","14 August 2007"," An excellent presentation of art in cinema.
","""A Clockwork Orange"" is one of the strangest and most brilliant films in existence. Based on the novel of the same name by Anthony Burgess, director Stanley Kubrick brings an ultimately surreal and artistic look to the movie.Never before have I seen a movie that works and operates so well on a visual level, and I am not sure if I ever will. It is a movie that must ultimately be seen to believe.<br/><br/>For the course of ""A Clockwork Orange"", we follow the experiences encountered by young British criminal/rapist Alex DeLarge, played wonderfully yet hauntingly by Malcom McDowell. Alex and his droogs (members in a gang lead by Alex) rape, beat, lynch, and steal just to have their own sick sense of enjoyment, all while communicating to each other in a type of language known as Nadsat. Whether you view these experiences as intelligent views on society or just plain vile and disgusting images, there is no denying that it is definitely artistic, and that is the level that this movie succeeds best on.<br/><br/>While the movie is full of violence and sexual content, it is the way that it is portrayed that truly sets it apart. Bright, brilliant colors make up much of the backgrounds and settings, while various pieces of classical music are used as background music. While the colors and music usually clash with what is taking place in a particular scene, the overall experience that they all create is truly a wonder to view.<br/><br/>I place a lot of emphasis on this movies artistic direction, and while it does make the movie what it is, it is not the only thing that makes the movie great. Malcom McDowell portrays the monster Alex DeLarge so well that, even though we find everything he does to be awful, he can almost make you sympathize with him when he encounters various problems. Even though you never agree with the type of person that Alex is (or at least I hope you don't), you can truly see Alex as an actual person, and I attribute this in great deal to Malcom McDowell.<br/><br/>It is not surprising that this movie was so controversial when it first came out in 1971, as it shows a great deal of infamous rape, sex, and violent scenes. To only see the movie as something of those elements only, though, is to be rather short-sighted. Another popular criticism of this movie is that it seems cold and lifeless, but that is necessary to ensure we see the entire move fold out in front of us like a piece of artwork. Simply said, their is no time for real character development. All that time wasted on complaining about such issues, however, detracts from time that could be spent on one of the most visually arresting and absolutely brilliant movies in existence."
"dj_xand325","10","1","3","13 August 2007"," Memorable, Mesmerising and Magnificent Masterpiece
","A Clockwork Orange is a story of a young degenerate called Alex de Large who seems as if he is a normal teenager living with his parents. But as you scratch the surface you see that he's a cold hearted evil criminal. After he gets betrayed by his gang and sent to jail for murder he is chosen to try out the governments new reformation program which has interesting results.<br/><br/>The reformation technique is called the 'Ludivico Technique' in which the prisoner is pinned down and forced to watch films of graphic crimes such as rape, murder etc. The idea of it is to give so much violence to the prisoner that he begins to dislike it and grow a natural resistance to it. This natural resistance is a sick sensation felt any time the thought of violence comes to the prisoners mind. Although this stops the prisoner committing crime, it raises ethical issues that are stressed by the prison vicar such as the fact that Alex isn't truly good, he only performs because of the fear of being in physical pain. A quote that interested me in the film is 'A man who cannot choose ceases to be a man'. Alex cant choose whether to do good or bad because hes a robot forced to do good. This in itself is called a clockwork orange. <br/><br/>There was much confusion of the name 'A clockwork orange' and what it means. In the book, F.Alexander is writing a book called a clockwork orange which Alex notices prior to the brutal rape of his wife (otherwise known as the 'singin in the rain' scene) he then rips its up. However this isn't in the film. The actual definition of a clockwork orange is someone that can only perform good or evil. This is in direct correspondence with Alex's story in the book and film.<br/><br/>Alex and his droogs (Dim, Pete and Georgie) use a very enigmatic and somewhat Shakespearian lexis such as 'chelloveck' and a personal favourite quote of mine 'how art thou glob of cheap stinking chip oil'. This is the slang of teenagers in the time of the film which is in the not so distant future. This is a fantastic prediction and also assumption of how youth will change. Many people find the dialect used by teenagers in the present day very hard to understand like we do to the language used by Alex and his droogs. No-one else seems to use that language other than Alex and his droogs, its teenage talk. Its like another realm of todays world. Also the fashion is a fantastic prediction of the not so distant future. The outfit and hairstyles in the film seem ridiculous to us as we watch it such as Alex's mum's crazy hair!. Much like today, we look back at 80's and 70's fashion and we see it as ridiculous. This all adds up to the conclusion that everything in this film is plausible even the crazy design of the Korova milk bar. <br/><br/>The movie is in three parts, Alex and his droogs, Alex in jail and the treatment then Alex out of Jail<br/><br/>Alex de Large rapes, steals and kills people but he listens to and is driven by Classical music such as Mozart and Beethoven. Music is a very important device in this film. Part 1 of the film is series of music and violence orchestrated together with perfect harmony. Kubrick manages to take relaxing classical music and use it to make the scenes deranged and frantic. Not only that, the film also manages to give the music sadistic outlooks for the audience. For example, i now see the 9th symphony and Singin in the rain as evil songs now however, i enjoy listening to them more!. The film conditions us to like or hate the music more much like Alex is inavertely conditioned to resist beethoven in the Ludivico technique later in the film.<br/><br/>Near the end of the film, Alex's demons come back to haunt him. Firstly, the old man he and his droogs assault in the beginning of the film spots him and realises who he is so he and his other homeless friends attack Alex savagely and take his belongings. Of course, Alex cant fight back because the pain of being punched is better than the sickly pain he gets if he performed any violence. The fight is then broken up by two police officers.....which Alex realises in horror are his two former droogs that betrayed him, Dim and Georgie. This is an ironic twist in the tale that the ones who are doing bad have switched sides. Alex is then near killed by his two former droogs. This is of course afer Alex had been rejected from home by another lodger staying there. He had no home, money or prospect so he ends at F.Alexanders house...Yes the man who Alex and his droogs assaulted earlier in the film. The writer doesn't recognise Alex at first but he knew he was on thin ice. F.Alexander wanted to use Alex for political value against the government because he is against the use of the Ludivico technique and the government. However, all changes when the old writer finds out who Alex really was when he hears him singing the same jingle he was singing when raping his wife, Im Singin in the rain. <br/><br/>Kubrick manages to make the audience feel sorry for Alex. We feel sorry for a prisoner of rape and murder. Alex is clearly an evil soul yet we seem to have a relationship with him through the film which makes us like him and empathise with him. This makes this film a beautifully cunning film. <br/><br/>I love the music, I love the iconic direction and I love the language!<br/><br/>10/10"

","When I first watched A Clockwork Orange, I gave it 10. Then I wondered whether I liked it that much - was it really that good, or was it just a film filled with random violence and sex? After a second viewing, I was convinced that this is one of the most brilliant - and bizarre, films ever made.<br/><br/>1971 was a particularly good year for film; Straw Dogs, Get Carter and Dirty Harry were some of the best, but A Clockwork Orange surpasses them all. Obviously it was hugely controversial when released, which pretty much just increased its popularity. The controversy however, was not needed, as the other films I have listed from 1971 were just as violent (although Straw Dogs was banned whereas this wasn't). All violence is in the first half an hour, and is nothing by today's standards. The violence and sex is only there to introduce us to the main character. After the opening, the story unfolds and is completely unique to any other film.<br/><br/>The screenplay is the key to this film. Stanley Kubrick did an amazing job of adapting a book which might as well be written in Japanese rather than English. I have a copy, which has to have a glossary defining all slang words used by Anthony Burgess - it is 10 pages long. The voice over narration is a masterful touch, offering us a portal into the mind of a total psychopath.<br/><br/>The only problem is in the nudity. Any need? There is at least 1 penis in every scene in the first half. It is completely pointless, and doesn't add anything to the film. And before you call me homophobic - the female nudity during the rape scenes is also totally unnecessary.<br/><br/>I'll forgive Kubrick for that though. Because with A Clockwork Orange, he has given us one of the best, most original and most unique films ever. Behind the sex, violence and controversy lies a story asking more questions than any other, and which has stood the test of time as easy as any script ever written."
"Chaves7777","10","1","3","20 May 2007"," Beethoven and ultra violence. Yes... of course its about our ""clockwork orange"".
","Stanley Kubrick is one of the most important directors of all movies history.

But, without a doubt, ""A Clockwork Orange"" can be called as its most important masterpiece. ""A Clockwork Orange"" is one of the most important critiques to any powerful division of the world.

But all change when Alex friends are unlawful with him. All is going to change? With a unforgettable Malcolm Mc Doweell as Alex, this futuristic propose of Kubrick is one of the most important works that i (Maybe every one) have ever seen. If don't is the ""most important"" critique of society (For me, the best movie that critiques society and world in every sense is Pier Paolo Pasolini's ""Salò o le 120 giornati di Sodoma"") is one of the best that you'll ever find. Alex, is that sarcastic character who embodies all a society. A dirty, unlawful and unmoral society. A society that in all its division, has and own interest (Politics and religion). An abusive and vengeful society. A society where only the strongest survives. The weakest lives wretchedly. And a society that think itself that is changed for good ... but maybe its the same ... maybe worst.<br/><br/>*Sorry for the mistakes ... well, if there any."

","Based on the 1962 book by Anthony Burgess, A Clockwork Orange cannot be described as anything but a masterpiece of the science fiction and drama genres.<br/><br/>Set in a futuristic London which resembles the old USSR, the film directed by genius (and detail-obsessive) Stanley Kubrick -director of 2001: A Space Odyssey and The Shining, among others- shows a gang of teenagers whose only aim in life is ultra-violence. Alex DeLarge, the main character, portrayed brilliantly by Malcolm McDowell, is the leader of this gang: a charming fifteen year old boy with a great passion for music, especially Beethoven.<br/><br/>Throughout the film, Alex and his droogs (friends in Nadsat- their teen slang, influenced by Russian) are shown raping, hurting and stealing without any sense of guilt or morality. What strikes most to the viewers about the film is that it gives a violent atmosphere while showing almost no blood. Moreover, nobody can avoid feeling sympathetic towards Alex, no matter how strong his lack of ethical issues is.<br/><br/>After quarreling with part of the gang, Alex is set a trap which leads him to jail, accused of murder. There, he takes part of a special reconditioning treatment, in order to shorten his sentence. Submitted to brainwashing, the boy goes out to the streets again, transformed into a different person but is he in reality? <br/><br/>There is no scene in the film which cannot be referred to as controversial: cruel fights shown in slow camera, with classical music backgrounds (who can forget the Singin' in the Rain scene!); a rape filmed in an aesthetically beautiful way; fast camera sex; concentration camps and Beethoven appearing on screen at the same time. When the film was released in 1971, it was rated either X or R, for strong explicit sexual content and rape, perverse nudity, brutal violence, and some language. Then again, most films nowadays show at least as much.<br/><br/>However, there are few films that deal with the topic of freedom of choice as A Clockwork Orange does. Is it right for a man to be good when he is not choosing to be so? Also starring Patrick Magee and Michael Bates, the film lasts 136 minutes and is a must-see of the cinema. After 36 years the film not only still holds us in grasp, but also speaks volumes about our current culture.<br/><br/>If I should critic anything about the film, however, it would be the fact that it does not show the last chapter of the book. Nevertheless, Kubrick had adapted it from the American version, which already lacks that final chapter, in which Alex grows and experiences a change, no longer finding pleasure in ultra-violence. Although in the introduction of the 1996 edition of the novel it is said that Kubrick found the end of the original edition too blandly optimistic and unrealistic, it shows a very different interpretation of the ""unruly youth"", which deserves to be known.<br/><br/>Therefore, not only the film is a must-see, but viewers should feel compelled to read the end of the book after it."

After I watched it a couple more times and did some research, I realized what a great film it is. First off it is a really great adaptation of the book which is written in a thick British dialect so it is extremely hard to understand. The story takes the unruliness of adolescent boys and how to deal with them. The film is shot really well. There are a lot of dark shots and contrast is used really well. I may never be able to listen to Beethoven again. Thought this movie is extremely violent and crazy. I think it is an excellent film.

"SkullyD","9","1","3","25 March 2007"," Brutal, shocking and ingenious.
","I will warn you. ""A Clockwork Orange"" makes no apologies. Its violence is brutal, its nudity graphic. But even more provocative is the fact that the film makes you care about a character who is essentially the villain of the story. Alex DeLarge, played with aplomb by Malcom MacDonald, is a spoiled, heartless, immoral bastard. Alex enjoys making other people suffer. He shows no remorse as he beats and old drunk, rapes a writer's wife or violently bludgeons a woman to death with a ceramic phallus. He seems disappointed in being sent to prison, but never sorry. When Alex undergoes behavioral conditioning is when we really begin to feel sorry for him. He's forced to watch scenes of sex and violence which, thanks to drugs, make him feel sick. He develops a physical aversion to both of his favorite pastimes, but there is no inner change. Alex is released from prison following his treatment and finds that he is no longer welcome. his parents have rented his room to a stranger, his old gang have become police officers who beat and nearly drown him and he is plagued by suicidal thoughts. Eventually, Alex attempts suicide. He lives. To avoid embarrassment, the government undoes his conditioning and bargains with him to keep his mouth shut. In the end, we're left to wonder who the real villain is; Alex, or the system which has spawned him. The film offers no pontification of this question. The viewer must decide; is ""badness"" a choice or an inborn quality? And ultimately the question becomes: Is man basically good or basically evil?"

","Stanley Kubrick made many important films during his career including several that are far more famous than ""Clockwork Orange."" (Considering the number of years his career spanned, it is amazing that he actually completed relatively few movies. It's been said that he never repeated himself, and perhaps that is why he made so few.) Still, despite ""2001,"" despite ""Dr. Strangelove,"" no Kubrick film has stuck with me as vividly as ""Clockwork Orange."" The Malcolm McDowell character may be the most frightening ever depicted -- far more disturbing than Hannibal Lector or the villains in those awful horror movies. The violence makes this movie difficult to watch. But you ought to see it if you are interested in great movies or in great moments in film history."

I got my best friend into it, and we like to quote it all the time. I really liked how they used quotes directly from the book in the movie. Some of the scenes though, Stanley Kubrick left out that I thought was necessary, for instance, the scene when he was raping the two 10 year old girls I thought had to be there because it showed how sick he was. Though there were some parts in there that weren't in the original book like when ALex was singing 'Singin in the Rain' as he was beating up the old man. That was rather sardonic yet entertaining. Overall I thought it was excellent and I would recommend it to anyone."

","A Clock Work Orange directed by Stanley Kubrick in 1971. The movie is great example of amazing art style cinema and Kubrick shows his visionary point of view as an artist.<br/><br/>Movie takes place near future in Britain. Main character anti-hero Alex is a teenage gang leader. Alex and his gang members are stealing, beating and raping their victims everyday. When Alex is jailed by cops he volunteers for the experimental cure program. And he does not know that treatment is painful brainwash until it is too late. He is cured and he is ready for the new life which will be more painful than his treatment. And ironically rapist and murderer hooligan Alex become a victim of the movie <br/><br/>In the movie, Kubrick delivers his messages in a perfect way by using symbolism in every frame. For instance, Alex kills his victim by using sculpture of the penis, He and his friends drink milk all the time and so on <br/><br/>Amazing storytelling, strange camera angles and movements make the movie totally different than other movies. Moreover, violence is so intense and realistic that creates disturbing feel its audience. Such as, using eyeball clams, rape and beating scenes are painful to watch<br/><br/>Kubrick creates very cold atmosphere by using his camera style. And the futuristic retro designs also give a moody ambiance its audience.<br/><br/>Political system as cruel as it can be moreover, Fascist government uses its power to control feelings. In that point, movie is asking its audience which is worst? His crime or the punishment he is given. <br/><br/>Another great thing about the movie is its character changing. These extreme characters changing create more trouble for our victim Alex.<br/><br/>I believe that Malcolm McDowell gives one of the most powerful performances in the history of cinema. Unfortunately, he did not get the attention which he deserved it.<br/><br/>Soundtrack of the A Clock Work Orange is as good as it can be. Whenever I hear Beethoven or singing in the rain I picture the scenes from the movie.<br/><br/>A Clock Work Orange is a masterpiece. In addition, Kubrick's powerful film making style proves his art vision. I came up with two questions. Is Stanley Kubrick the greatest director of all time? And, is A Clock Work Orange best Kubrick movie? I believe that he is the greatest and yes A Clock Work Orange is the best Kubrick movie."

","Malcolm McDowell plays the optimum role in the film. His cruel intent eyes. and his hook smile, bring upon a vindictive character that all will fear. Although the cool, controlled motions of his character bring about an icon that most men would like to experience once in a lifetime, his leadership ways are so sincere. He is both feared and revered. He is an ugly Churchill. Taking into account the other end of the spectrum, women find him dominating, yet attractive and at the same time very repulsive. He is both feared and loathed. He is an ugly Bruce Willis.<br/><br/>The film also highlights the idea that abiding by the law and conforming to religion, is the correct way that people should live. Being filmed in 1971, religions that were of the minority at the time, were not taken into account and were dismissed entirely. Yet who is to decide that this is right? There is that edge that Christianity is the only root.<br/><br/>Throughout the film Beethoven's 'ninth symphony' can be interpreted in a rainbow of ways. There is the fear of being unable to predict what is around the corner, but it also has that definitive feel of defiance and dominance. It is so consistent throughout the film, it creates an equilibrium level. Furthermore the use of William Tell brings an accelerated pulse to the consented sexual notions in the film.<br/><br/>The use of Russian language and the combined idiolect of the characters bring about some amount of social understanding and status hierarchy. The understanding however, is shot right back down when the filmography is taken into account. Stanley Kubrick uses wide shots on a technicolour camera then extreme close ups on the characters, whereby the appearance means nothing and their facial expressions and eyes show their emotions.<br/><br/>Guilt is a key theme that runs throughout the film, recognised fully at the end, unfortunately however sometimes not recognised at all. None of the characters feel guilt, it is in actual fact the audience that feel it. It is the pressures that the Government put people under to bring a shortcut to legislation and the revival of criminals. One thing that the audience should not feel guilty about however, is thoroughly enjoying the film, as it is a work of art in its own right.<br/><br/>And lets face it, Karma is a key concept, and if believed we should all treat our friends better and take into account how much they are worth....BKWF"

","From start to finish Stanley Kubricks' 'A Clockwork Orange' entrances the viewer with incredible sets, astonishing music and a brilliant script Malcolm McDowell puts on his best performance as the anti hero protagonist Alex DeLarge. McDowell truly captures the charm, evil, unique and mesmerising character which the viewer will fall deeply in love with.<br/><br/>The sets of this unmissable film are the greatest i have ever seen, which ooze with colour and unique obscenity. Every time i watch my Clockwork Orange DVD i enjoy the use of shadows, mirrors and pictures throughout. Kubrick's unique vision of Anthony Burgess' classic novel remains as provocative and powerful as when it was banned 36 years ago.<br/><br/>The violence portrayed is disturbing and show the depth of Alex's evil. In the first 10 minutes of the picture the viewer sees some of the most disturbing violence seen on screen. This evil is accompanied by his love for music especially for Beethoven's ninth symphony.<br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange is far more then a controversial masterpiece. It is a unique study of language, visual interpretation, the power of music and of course the universal question of free will."
"Korovabar","10","1","3","22 January 2007"," Greatest movie ever.
","A clockwork Orange is a brilliant masterpiece of Stanley Kubrick: in my honest opinion, the best movie he ever made. The Shining en 2001: A Space Oddesey were fabulous movies, but ACO rises all above them. To tell you the truth, I have never been so impressed by a movie as this one. I now am going to explain the reason for that right know, at least, I'll try to.<br/><br/>What many people say, is true: The first time you watch this movie, you really think ""What the ****""????? and you'll prefer to throw this movie away. Then again, it's not a movie to rent at a dull Friday night with a bunch of friends. No my droogs, this is a very controversial movie, so brutal and cruel yet filled with so many messages and looks at the future, you really have to think while watching this movie, and have to stay serious. The movie has very funny pieces in it, but then again, it's far from a comedy. It's a dramatic, criminal, violent, and also a very crazy movie. But with crazy I mean it the good way crazy. This movie is about a teenager (16-18)named Alex, who's life is all violence, sex and Beethoven. Every night he sits at the Korova Milk Bar, drinking drug milk with his 'droogs' (buddies or friends) Dim, Pete and Georgie. Dressed very odd, they walk and drive to town, raping and beating the **** out of innocent people. Just for fun. But when they are breaking into a woman's house, the other droogs take revenge on Alex for being to bossy and too violent against them (pushing Dim into the water, slapping him etc. etc.). Alex is caught by the police and has to go to jail for 14 years. For 2 years he sits in this prison, when he hears of a new technique that will cure him and make him a free man in 14 days. He agrees...<br/><br/>Thus so far the story line: I don't want to tell too much of it, for many people still have to watch this movie.<br/><br/>Why do I give it a 10?? This movie is harsh, violent and almost pornographic sometimes, but those are just a few scenes. The real moral of this movie, the plot, the idea behind this whole story is the work of a genius. Also, they can make a movie look so good without any SF and the actor's are doing a great job, especially Alex. Also, the set is very strange, yet awesome: you can't place this movie in a certain time period or year. This movie still plays on in my head after 2 years, still let me think about this strange world and I'm still a great fan of Alex and his droogs. Cheers."
"quakeulf","10","1","3","7 January 2007"," I cannot see it enough times
","First of all I just have to admit that this movie has some outdated shocking material. A lot of movies have outdone this movie now in terms of shocking contents like Baise Moi, Visitor Q, Za ginipiggu and Moomin. Even though they are more shocking, they are not good enough movies otherwise in my opinion. They are lacking in many other areas of which A Clockwork Orange shines through like a billion suns on a bright summer morning.<br/><br/>This is the kind of movie I can watch again and again and still want to watch yet another time. What appeals to me so much is the use of music, the mildly non-formulaic story, the characters like the loud prison warden, the writer and Mr. Deltoid, and how it all fits together so nicely with such unparalleled pacing.<br/><br/>There is something about this movie that moves me, that really evokes feelings inside me that no other movie have come close to give me. It makes me happy to watch, and is to me the very best feel-good movie I have seen so far in my life. There are of course minor things in this movie I find rather unnerving, like the opening sequence with the Korova milk bar and the moving camera that a bit awkward, and the scene with the lodger, but apart from those, there really is nothing I can think of that makes this movie feel bad.<br/><br/>The use of music like ""The thieving magpie"", ""Pomp and circumstances"" and Beethoven's symphonies is what makes this movie sound so spectacular as can be. Luckily it also avoids the ""epic"" movies like LOTR and Eragon's use of clichéd touchy-feely string music in key moments, but that is not to say it does not have its touchy-feely music in there. Which brings me onto the excellent use of pacing, that really makes the use of such music in this movie so great, and because it is only used once, it is totally acceptable and fits in really well. No need for repetition, it gets its point across and that is all that it needs to.<br/><br/>To sum it up: I can at the present moment not imagine a more perfect movie for me to watch.<br/><br/>10/10 on IMDb's rating system is my final verdict."
"paragz","10","1","3","4 January 2007"," the Dark side of humor
","Kubrick's Clockwork orange is one of the finest example of idealistic and path breaking film making. It clearly depicts his own love for the story and cinema and this movie clearly defies all boundaries and will remain an all time classic.<br/><br/>The characters have been artistically portrayed and with a very futuristic view the film has been designed with such authenticity and neutrality that even 35 years after this movie was made, it still has a contemporary feel. It difficult to believe that the movie was made in 1971, because even today with so many technological advancements several filmmakers would not be brave enough to justify a script like this one.<br/><br/>The characters are bold, 'in your face' and have meticulously enacted by the artists. Its hard to believe that its fiction. The euphemistic and dark humor depicted in scenes where Alex is examined before entering the prison or where Alex kills the lady with an antique dildo is outrageously app laudable. The script and story moves along briskly and takes some 'out of the box' turns as we progress along with Alex's life. The sarcasm of human nature cannot be ignored.<br/><br/>This movie will always remain an all-time favorite. Kubrick is the best!"
"xiayun","9","1","3","2 December 2006"," A mind-boggling film
","I'm not even sure how to start reviewing this one of the kind film. I had seen 5 Kubrick's films previously (The Killing, Paths of Glory, Dr. Strangelove, Full Metal Jacket, and Eyes Wide Shut), and the uniqueness of each endeavor is so palpable. His film is divisive because he is not afraid to push the envelop, and A Clockwork Orange is more vivid in that regard than any others. From its jaw-dropping opening shot (I was like, ""oh my goodness, this is going to be weird""), the first act went on a mind-boggling journey of sex, violence, and unlawfulness. The extreme sadistic behavior is presented with Beethoven's classical music on the background; it truly has to be seen to be believed.<br/><br/>The story got progressively weaker in the second and third acts, but it showed the other extreme of trying to eliminate the ""criminal impulse"", the dark side of human mind, by developing a negative Pavlovian response to illegal activities through medical and psychological treatments. It demonstrated the danger of dehumanization and proposed the important question of, as a society, how much we are willing to trade our freedom for a ""quieter"", more secure life. Alex turned from a chilling villain to a somewhat sympathetic victim; a lot of his acts are despicable, but somehow we could identify with him throughout the movie, even if we don't want to admit.<br/><br/>The film touches some serious subjects, so it could easily feel heavy-handed with a lesser director, but Kubrick's style, full of memorable images, just completely absorbed me in until toward the end. It's both a satire and drama and deserves the status fans have given."
"mwuttke-1","Null","1","3","26 November 2006"," Thrilling and Attracting
","After having watched the film for several times, I must say that ""A Clockwork Orange"" is truly a masterpiece and has not lost any attraction ever since. Why? Because Kubrick managed to connect his ""style"" and the controversial topic of Anthony Burgess novel ""A Clockwork Orange"" and turned it into a nightmarish and futuristic thriller. When I watched it for the first time, I was completely stoked and could not believe that it was made back in the 1970s, because for me it could easily keep up with a lot of today's films.<br/><br/>Especially the language of ""Alex and his droogs"", ""Nadsat"", a mix of old Russian and English got me right from the first scene of the film and has not let loose ever since I have watched it for the first time either... <br/><br/>Some people argue that the violence used in ""A Clockwork Orange"" might be too ""violent"" and too graphic, but I think that the violence only contributes to Kubrick's main goal of connecting the strong language and strong violence, in order to create the notion of a strong apocalyptic future, where the individual is completely dispatched from any kind of values, confronted with a society based on the material status and only functions (especially in Alex' case) as society's cue ball. <br/><br/>Almost like our current world! Almost?"
"pittsallison","10","1","3","20 November 2006"," Society as a person.
","The most enigmatic villain/ protagonist/ hero graces the screen and shocks us into amazement and revulsion. From the start, one feels as if one is watching a snuff film: the gritty, slarkly brutal beatings and the rape set to the tune that implied the joy of being in love creating a world that you thought you understood. Then one is taken into the home of what had thus far been painted as an untouchable and distant figure. Allowed to see inside the room and presumably the mind of this man, who, the viewer is shocked to see, still lives with his parents. Humanizing seems an incorrect word to use here when you consider that everything that Alex did and that we can assume that he would do is all inherently human, human nature being more akin to that of a beast than any of us would like to let on. We can all identify with Alex in one way or another, because Alex is the unbridled product of society set loose upon itself."
"SmileysWorld","7","1","3","10 November 2006"," A strange film indeed,oh my brothers! But good!
","It goes without saying that Stanley Kubrick had unique visions when it came to film making,steering clear of any traditional styles and clichés.What struck me about A Clockwork Orange was it's unique dialog and unique musical soundtrack.Who would've ever thought we would see or hear Singin' in the Rain or Beethoven's 5th in such a way as it is here?The plot of this film is to say the least,bizarre.It all takes on the appearance of a strange English dream,yet something about it is very appealing.Despite it's strangeness,you are compelled to keep watching.It's one of those rare films that makes it difficult to tell anyone about it or give away any of the plot line.You just have to see it for yourself,and that qualifies it for greatness."
"Taran_Cross","10","1","3","10 November 2006"," Oh My Brothers!
","This is possibly one of my favorite movies of all time. This is by far the best Kubrick film ever, the brilliance of this movie is three fold; first, the performance by Malcolm McDowell, second the music, and third the political message presented by the movie. McDowell's take on the character Alex is so excellent because he makes you love him. Even when he's doing the most despicable and deplorable acts you can't help cheering him on, and wanting him to do these things to women, and innocents. You love this sociopath and want to hang out with him and go indulge in a little of the old ultraviolence with him. Every time he says my brothers you can't help being taken in by his charismatic and bad ass personality. The scariest part of this movie is when it's over and your sitting there and you realize that you love the character Alex, and you wonder what that says about you as a person. Second the integration of Ludwig van into the movie is what makes it a masterpiece. Beethoven almost becomes a character in and of himself in the film, like he's speaking to you through those eyes as the 9th is playing. also the scene where Alex singing singin' in the rain while raping the wife is so powerful, and it's amplified by the choice of such a happy go lucky song. After watching the movie so many times it's impossible to tell if I love this movie because of my love of Beethoven or if I love Beethoven more because of this movie. They become unified in your mind so that you cannot hear the 9th without thinking about Alex and this movie. You love Alex because as he is a rogue and utter miscreant, but the music he loves isn't hardcore rock, or death metal (even though they didn't exist in 1971) it's classical, and Lugwin van! That more than anything makes you love this character because of his complexity. Lastly, the political message of the movie. How the 'treatment' that Alex is given turns him not into a good man, but rather into a mechanical apparatus that has no real choice. I also love the irony that is not lost on the audience of the Priest saying that Alex has no choice, and is not really being good. But Alex is really the best Christian, because Christianity does not say that people should be good men for the sake of being righteous, but rather because of a threat of punishment if you perform bad acts, this is paralleled to the sickness that Alex experiences, which is his personal hell. The political implication of this are far-reaching and reflect many political writings on control, mainly, to me, Michael Foucault and the idea of biopower. Where in, after much conditioning the agent will control himself because of fear of a threat that may not even be present, much like the mind police in 1984, the fear of possible punishment controls the agent, as it does Alex. For while the drug has left his system the effects of the conditioning make him feel as if he is sick, he is within the panopticon. This is one of the greatest movies of all time, and reflects the artistic brilliance of it's creator. It is one that all generations should experience, whether you are a baby boomer, or if you are a member of generation x like myself. I tip my hat to the genius Stanley Kubrick, possibly the greatest writer/director ever, and this is his shining jewel that blinds with it's magnificence"
"dean2900","10","1","3","26 October 2006"," Great movie. Has aged like fine wine
","I prefer escapism but I do occasionally enjoy a movie that has a a point to make and A Clockwork Orange is one of my all-time favorites.<br/><br/>I am not a big fan of 20001, but love Dr Strangelove, and even one of the few people that appreciated Eyes Wide Shut.<br/><br/>The story is narrated by Malcom McDowell as a young thug who him and his cronies like to terrorize, mug, rape, and abuse people for their sadistic entertainment.<br/><br/>One of Alex's rape victim dies and he is put in jail.<br/><br/>Alex volunteers for a ""brainwashing"" experiment which will have him back in society in no time.<br/><br/>The brainwashing requires his eyes to be help open by metal pins and for him to watch constant violence while being given drugs to be make him ill. The operant conditioning works and Alex is not capable of harming his fellow man.<br/><br/>However, once he is released from Prsion, many people including his only cronies do harm Alex who is defenseless to protect himself.<br/><br/>The movies asks the question ""What measures are considered moral in order to make society safe."" The movie has done a great job of turning Alex into a hate villain from the first Act into a sympathetic character that people can relate to by the third act.<br/><br/>The leaves out the last chapter of the book and shows that Alex has reverted back to his old self after bring tortured by his previous victims and pals. In the book, the final chapter showed him becoming a productive member of society. I like the ending of the movie better because it is a bit more cynical and basically shows that you cannot change what person is inside.<br/><br/>The movie is loaded with Sex and Violence but nothing to the point of artless garbage such as Hostel. This movie was made for adults and for people who want to think about the theme's presented.<br/><br/>The movie was filmed in an a not often used 1.66 to 1 ratio and objects in the center of the picture look perfect while objects on the edges look distorted. This is a interesting technique used by Kubrick.<br/><br/>I will admit the one part I don't understand is that Alex's mother has a different hair color in every scene of the movie. She has orange hair, green hair, blonde hair, etc. It is not critical to the plot but there must me something I am is-sing on that part.<br/><br/>This is one of two movies (out of 1000s) that I have rated 10/10.<br/><br/>Dean"
"booyatom","10","1","3","15 October 2006"," Singin' in the Rain
","I saw this film recently. ""Legendary"", ""cult classic"", ""extreme violence"", ""agonizingly crude scenes""; all these were but a few terms used in reference to it. I was quite uneasy before seeing it, worrying that I might not appreciate it enough. Or maybe I wouldn't ""get it"". I had heard that this film contained very important social messages which viewers were not allowed not to grasp. So with all this hype, I rented A Clockwork Orange and learned what classics are all about. <br/><br/>The first thing that people who approach classics warily must learn is that these films are deemed so because they are highly accessible and let you go filled with ideas you did not have going in. Classics are not work, they impress you with their looks and their styles, their stories and the innovative ways in which they are told.<br/><br/>One could interpret Kubrick's classic anyhow desired. One could say the film's message is you cannot ""cure"" someone from what is inherent, in this case, a sociopath. Or, one could say the message of the film is you reap what you sow; you can never escape the mistakes of your past because they will end up coming back at you in any way, shape or form. Of course, there are a plethora of other social messages in this film. <br/><br/>Independent of the derived messages of the story, the film is brilliantly constructed. First and foremost, the main character's evolution throughout the film is admirably conveyed by both Malcolm McDowell and Kubrick. McDowell presents us with an absolutely ruthless Alex Delarge whom everybody fears, regardless of his stature; for all we know, he's eighty feet tall with that demonic look in his eyes. The actor shows, through his character, all the signs of a true sociopath, as seen when Alex gives us his first rendition of ""Singin' in the Rain"". In this early scene, we literally witness our main character (or as he deems himself, ""your narrator"") break into a married couple's residence, beat the man and rape the woman, all this while singing the aforementioned song. In stark contrast, after the controversial treatment he undergoes sets him free, he is not at all the same person, and only a great actor can genuinely convey that. In addition, what really got to me was when they put him in that restraining chair and they forced his eyes open. There was no cinema magic involved there, they were actually doing that to McDowell, yet he remained totally in character, albeit the physical discomfort. <br/><br/>Now with regards to what Kubrick does in order to bring life to Alex's evolution throughout the film. There's a certain quality great directors have when making their great films and I believe it is that they immerse themselves so completely, heart and soul, into their works that all throughout them, there is a reigning atmosphere which screams that they are creations of artists. A Clockwork Orange bears these qualities. Unlike bad directors (whomever they may be), great ones do not dissociate themselves from their films, undertaking the shooting as a purely technical process riddled with time constraints and budget concerns. The first part of ACO (that is, until Alex is captured) is dominated by the classical music that Alex loves. Even during the beatings and the rapes, the background music is always happy, feel-good music. This is a means Kubrick uses to show what a sociopathic monster Alex is. Killing is fun, rape is a blast. This is Kubrick's message for the first part of the film. Consider this: Kubrick could just as easily have played heavy, dramatic music, or nothing at all, through all this. But he didn't. The reigning atmosphere here is surreal: the attacks are surreal, the homes are surreal and the characters are surreal. It is as if Kubrick is Alex during the film. <br/><br/>A classic comes down to these pretty basic components: great acting, great directing, a score that improves the action instead of hindering it, great writing and all the offshoots of these. Don't break your heads over what we call classics. They are just damn good films."

","Whatever you say about the film's message or moral core, A Clockwork Orange is sensational entertainment. There is no need to search for meaning. Alex is a fantastic protagonist, someone morally reprehensible but very complex, oozing menace and character. His exploits throughly explore this and also how he adapts to survive. The effect hardship has on him show his depth. <br/><br/>This film is Kubrick through and through. Visually stunning, full of futuristic design and cinematography reminiscent of 2001. I view it as pure entertainment, full of dark humour, violence and nudity. Yet it has to be treated seriously. The tone of A Clocwork Orange is very haunting with a chilling soundtrack. It has an endless ability to send shivers down my spine. Alex's narration is very important as it tells you exactly how his complex mind works. The film throws up many fascinating, enthralling and even comical scenarios for Alex which are expertly depicted by Kubrick for maximum impact and suspense. That makes for a great film."

He skips school, parties hardy, and has a good night out with his ""droogies"" causing mayhem. Alex loves a good night that involves rape, ultra-violence, and Beethoven. He and his entourage, eventually, cause so much mayhem that in the process of having fun, Alex murders a woman. On the way out his posse leaves him behind and he goes to jail for murder. When an inspector comes to the jail he chooses Alex for a test of a new project that can cure criminals of their crime and leave them free of crime for the rest of their days and can do it within a year. Alex is very excited and eager to begin the project.<br/><br/>The project involves Alex strapped to a chair with his eyes forced open watching films of extreme ultra-violence, including disturbing WWII violence, and films of terror, including graphic rape. Alex is stunned and sickened by the footage and is cured. Or is he? Returning home, he has the hope of returning to his home but when he finds someone else renting out his room he tries to pick a fight but the thought of violence almost makes him vomit and he runs away to find himself get caught with people who he has tortured in the past when he was king of the streets. He seeks refuge in a rich writers home who, unknown to Alex, is a man who's wife was raped by Alex and died a few days later. Alex later realizes it when he calls government people over to ""help Alex"" but the end up helping the man get his revenge by playing Alex's favorite-turned-least-favorite artist, Ludwig van Beethoven.

I won't go into a summary of the plot or the meaning behind any of it all because that has all been discussed at length here by other reviewers. I will simply write that it is impossible to overstate how truly remarkable and unique this film is, and how simply genius the vision and talent of Stanley Kubrick was with regards to A Clockwork Orange. This has been my favorite film since I first saw it about twenty-two years ago. I certainly enjoy and appreciate other films, though no other work in the medium of film has even come close to approaching this film, in my opinion, as the best example of the medium as an art form. (How very fitting that Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, the best piece of music ever written, features prominently in this film. A marriage made in Heaven!) Though usually classified in the genre 'science fiction,' this film genuinely defies categorization, so universal is its scope. Every moment of it is poetry. A priceless film and one of humanity's crowning achievements. I'd give it 100 stars out of 10 if that were mathematically possible."

Blatant nudity, brutal violence, and a few rape scenes, to name a few.<br/><br/>However, what really pushes this movie into cult classic, and classic period, is how Alex is completely turned around by ""the cure"". Being a no good, immoral punk, to a straight-laced person that literally couldn't hurt a fly, even if he tried. The way his parents reject him is very emotional. Malcolm McDowell delivers some of the best acting I've ever seen.<br/><br/>This film teaches a lesson to everyone: be careful what you do in the past, for they will haunt you in the future, in ways you can't even imagine. This is shown in the surprisingly emotional 40 minutes, when Alex is turned away by his parents, former friends, and people he had hurt in the past.<br/><br/>This is definitely a must see, and definitely one of Kubrick's best."

","What I personally admire most about Stanley Kubrick, and about his work in his master opus A Clockwork Orange especially, is the extent to which the film maker completely disregards the cliché, invariable Hollywood motifs that are present in and ruin so many potentially enjoyable films: there is no obligatory Hollywood love story in this film; there is positively no regard for normal Hollywood decency standards, especially of the time; there is no effort made to minimalize the esoteric language used by Alex and his droogs, despite the fact that only an individual with a moderate grasp on Russian could understand the nature of the speech; and there are, as far as I have noticed, no concessions made to the mainstream, whatsoever. Kubrick relates Anthony Burgess's story in a manner arguably considerably more effective, if not just completely better, than that of the novel. Set to an absolutely glorious soundtrack, featuring Rossini, Elgar, Beethoven, and other great giants of classical music; featuring fight scenes that are so ingeniously choreographed as to be amusing as well as visually stimulating; featuring the signature camera work of Kubrick himself; featuring 'futuristic' art and other eye candy, Clockwork Orange in film form is Burgess's vision brought to life. To glorious, brilliant life. The story of the film is unique in that it combines relative simplicity and sheer genius. As the film focuses on the escapades on the young Alexander De Large (a play on words from a scene in the book that Burgess fans will remember smilingly, as Alex refers to himself as 'The Large'; no last name is actually ever given in the book) and his fortunes, the audience is able to observe in one character, many characters. First there is the revel-rousing, obviously clinically insane Alex, the leader of a gang of vicious young criminals; then, there is the scheming institutionalized Alex, who wants nothing more than to get out of prison; then there is the Alex who is a puppet of society after his treatment; and then there is Alex the victim, the treatment having gone terribly wrong. And, in the end, there is the same old Alex, the criminal, indicated subtly so to the audience in the triumphant final scene of the film when he utters a pair of lines identical to those he had spoken earlier in the film. In the end, Kubrick's Clockwork Orange is a masterpiece. It is a psychological analysis, and it is social satire; it is a showcase for beautiful music and beautiful language; it is an amusing spectacle of dark humour and sly jocularity; is a bizarre, chilling dystopian tale; and it is, very possibly, the most enjoyable film ever produced. And this can largely be contributed to Kubrick's disregard for the Hollywood mainstream. This film is as good and important to people as it is for films, as well. If you are human, and if you enjoy a good film, then Clockwork Orange will suit you just fine. Even if you've fallen desperately dependent upon the sort of mainstream nonsense that Hollywood pumps out today. Indeed, if that is your situation, you will find Kubrick's Clockwork Orange a breath of fresh air, and you will find yourself desperately desiring more films like it. Sadly, there are so few. Wnjoy this film, then, for what it's worth: a great film for the sake of being a great film. And it is truly that, if nothing else. A great film."

","I have seen all of Kubrick's movies and i loved each and every one of them but A Clockwork Orange is different and original from the rest. I was in way confused my first time i seen it. This is a type of movie you have to see more than once to fully understand its meaing. The movie is set in the near future where there is a struggle between power and technology. The story takes off when we see Alex a young troubled teen caught in the middle of this struggle in society. Him and his three friends go along the night causing whatever mayham then can. This is were the most disturing scenes of the film are mostly were Alex and his gang break in a writers home and make him wacth as they gang rap his wife. Alex acts as the commander of the band of rouges. One night the boys get fed up with him and set him up. Alex gets arrested and is put in prison but has a chance to shorten his term. He Voulneteers for a project by the government which is just part of the chaos in society. After that Alex is released he quickly finds out the world is in worse condition than before and he realizes he is a clockwork orange. The movie is most notorious for the portion when Alex and his friends are doing harmful acts against people and it shows how this all seems a bit fictional it could become reality."
"matlefebvre20","10","1","3","22 April 2006"," Outrageously remarkable
","""A Clockwork Orange"" is without any doubt the most politically incorrect movie that I could have seen in my short life. Full of sex, violence and shocking and degrading images so much that it could make the screen blowing off, it appears necessary to wonder why many people (including myself) dare to talk about this Kubrick picture as a masterpiece.<br/><br/>""A Clockwork Orange"" tells the story of Alex (Malcolm McDowell), a young delinquent who patrols the streets of a futuristic and dystopic London accompanied by his ""Droogies"" and their only goal is to get ""a bit of the old ultra-violence"". We can quickly discover Alex's only three interests: savage violence, raping and Ludwig van Beethoven. Why does he love Beethoven so much? Judging by the images that are shown, it's simply that Beethoven's music inspires violence in Alex's soul.<br/><br/>However, Alex's life takes a different turn when he is betrayed by his Droogies and then arrested and jailed for fourteen years for the murder of a lady in her residence. After two years of incarceration, Alex is offered to be liberated after two weeks if he agrees to give himself up to an experimental treatment which is supposed to free him from any desire for violence and brutal sexual acts.<br/><br/>Even if there isn't any doubt that the main theme for this film is the origins of good and evil in the human being, it could be totally normal that some people ask questions about the utility of including so many scenes of violence and sex in order for the story to make the point about the conclusions it attends to draw.<br/><br/>It's probably because ""A Clockwork Orange"" seems more to be an exercise of style and a test of tolerance rather than a simple and ordinary allegory about a dystopia that doesn't really differ from many other portrayals that we've already seen before.<br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick doesn't content himself by putting degrading scenes in their most natural character. He brings each time his own personal touch and transforms the vice into art.<br/><br/>Kubrick's favorite weapon remains the ironic use of music, just like in ""2001"". Rossini's services are particularly used. The brawling scene between Alex's own gang and a rival gang is particularly brutal, not to say almost humorous, and that on the strains of Rossini's ""The Thieving Magpie"".<br/><br/>The scene where Alex rapes two young girls in his room is very particular and is probably the best one in the whole movie. In fact, the scene is shot in fast-motion on the strains of the famous piece ""William Tell Overture"" (also played in fast-motion).<br/><br/>And obviously, how could we forget the famous raping scene of Mr. Alexander's (Patrick Magee) wife? How could we forget those images where Alex, wearing a Pinocchio-like mask, ill-treats his victims while singing ""Singin' in the Rain"" and dancing just like Gene Kelly? <br/><br/>In fact, Kubrick's cinematography stays simple except at the moments where offending images appear. So Kubrick's goal is to prove that it is possible to treat violence as an art. It's nothing but morally unacceptable, so why doing it? Kubrick rather seems to ask: why not doing it? <br/><br/>It's rather obvious that Kubrick doesn't give a damn about the commercial side of cinema. After all, his film originally received a X from MPAA and was inevitably condemned by religious authorities. It must be admitted: Kubrick didn't draw a very flattering portrait of religion in his movie. We can see four plaster Christs wearing rather prominent crotches and Alex, in his fantasies, imagines himself taking pleasure to whip Jesus carrying his cross and we can see him taking part to bloody death fights and orgies.<br/><br/>The society presented in ""A Clockwork Orange"" really is a totally absurd society where totalitarian and repressive governments can emerge anywhere, even in traditionally democratic states like England. Several characters are so much bizarre that we cannot even consider them as living caricatures. It's the case of Mr. Deltoid (Aubrey Morris) with his totally ridiculous smile who drinks water from a glass containing a denture. There also are the prison guards which look more like soldiers than civil servants. Their chief (Michael Bates) furiously look like Adolf Hitler.<br/><br/>The film succeeds in giving the impression of a futuristic world without ever showing any futuristic technology. Everything is based upon peculiarity. We can see Alex and his Droogies wearing totally white suits as well as bowler hats, top hats and flat caps. As for women, they dye their hair in fluorescent green, blue and pink. The architecture and design are also odd, without counting upon the fact that it's often garish and ugly.<br/><br/>But Malcolm McDowell's performance is all but undesirable. His character shows so much charisma that he almost hides his sadism and his own darkness. He is violent, not because of a mental disorder, nor because of an unstable family or social order, but because he chose to act that way. He also made the choice of subjecting himself to the Ludovico treatment and he made the choice of throwing himself out of the window when he's unable to bear with his new situation. But the treatment looks like an antidote to freedom. So it's a formidable battle that Alex does against society itself. And when he's searching for forgiveness, he can't find anyone ready to offer him.<br/><br/>It's therefore a cold, hopeless and pessimistic look that Kubrick offers here. In his case, it's just normal. He simply combined his ideas with an exercise of style that acts at the same time as some kind of test to check out what an audience is ready to bear to watch a movie. Even thirty-five years later, ""A Clockwork Orange"" have lost nothing of its ability to shock and cause controversy. For me, it's a shocking film but there's nothing to blame. It's outrageous and it's remarkable. Nothing else to add, O my brothers!"

","I have just seen ""A Clockwork Orange"" for the first time, after many years looking forward to seeing it. Looking back, it was good that I didn't watch it when I was younger, as I probably wouldn't be mature enough to handle it.<br/><br/>""A Clockwork Orange"" is certainly one of the most cruel, bizarre and disturbing films ever made. There are some really unpleasant, ultra-violent scenes. It is disturbing because it's not gratuitous, like Larry Clark's movies (especially the outrageous ""Ken Park""). Anthony Burgess and Stanley Kubrick were visionaries. ACO not only hasn't aged, but it's quite a landmark now rather than it was 40 years ago. We can see a gang like Mr. Alex de Large's (Malcolm McDowell, superb) on every corner. 21st century youth is gradually getting lost. It's such an empty, brutal state that the recent movies to portray this callow, lost youth don't even use metaphors to criticize the ""society"": they're raw, straight to the point (at least, most of them). ""Thirteen"" and ""Elephant"" are good examples. They may not be half strong and original as ACO, but they're sadly realistic; because we tend to think there isn't a true reason for these teenagers to behave so badly. Apparently, they have everything they need. Whether there's a solution or not, I don't know. What could it be? Brainwash? It wouldn't work. Unless it's in a large scale. High technology has made us lazier, there are lunatic clowns in power, Lindsay Lohan and Hilary Duff are queens and ""Crash"" gets the Best Picture Oscar. It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World. I'm laughing not to cry.<br/><br/>Holden Caulfield, the catcher in the rye, is an idol of mine. He was no angel, but at least he tried to understand what's around him  in his eventually twisted way. But at least he tried. And he was sincere. Alex de Large is a bastard. I don't relate to him but, unfortunately, as an 18 year-old guy, I've known much more De Larges than Caulfields. I should stop digressing.<br/><br/>My verdict: ""A Clockwork Orange"" is a truly unique film, one of Kubrick's best  if not the best. Watch it by yourself. You may not find a solution, but you're going to have an unforgettable cinematic experience. 10 out of 10."

","Kubrick's second, just a little bit behind to 2001. Violence is violence opium to people, and it only can generate... yes you guessed it, Violence. Set Design, costume Design, Music, everything might be considered perfect. McDowell's performance is amazing, what is a shame is that he didn't get the recognition he deserved. Plus, Singin' in the Rain, has a whole new meaning for me. Metaphorically speaking the movies sends the message of Violence as a disgrace of society beautifully. Not for everyone but.. great if you have an opened mind and appreciate the real message.Kubrick sends a message for ages... ""I was cured, all right"", that's how you end a movie."

","Clockwork Orange shows a man and his insatiable love for violence. Alex is a sick and demented man who takes pleasure in others' suffering and demise, until he eventually sees the horror of his actions. He wants to be a part of a new system of reform to get out of prison early, but he slowly loses his sanity and humanity in the process. What he once loved, he now cringes at the thought of. He becomes even more twisted in his mind after becoming ""reformed"".<br/><br/>The story and the events that take place in this film make it an instant classic in the movie industry.

","A Clockwork Orange (1971) <br/><br/>Malcolm McDowell, Patrick Magee, Anthony Sharp, Warren Clarke, James Marcus, Godfrey Quigley, Michael Bates, Philip Stone, Carl Duering.<br/><br/>'A Clockwork Orange' is, without a doubt, one of the strangest films I have ever seen, and will ever see. It is twisted, disturbing, and ultimately haunting. It is a masterpiece that shows us a look inside the mind of an intelligent, yet disturbed youth.<br/><br/>The plot is about an older teen named Alex who enjoys listening to Beethoven, skipping school, and hanging out with his friends during the evening in a not too distant future. He is obsessed with sex/rape (""the old in-out"") and ""ultra violence"" so much that he thinks about it almost all the time. During the nights, he and his ""droogs"" either hang out at a milk bar, terrorize bums on the street, or get into brawls. They get into a gang fight, steal a car, break into a writer's house, beat up the writer and rape his wife right in front of his eyes.<br/><br/>The next night, Alex accidentally kills a woman inside her home. When he leaves, his friends betray him and leave him for the police. Alex is sent to prison for years because of his crime. In prison, he hears of something that can cure people from their problems. The doctors decide to test it on Alex by flashing images onto a screen, images that Alex is obsessed with. When Alex is released, his former victims and friends plot revenge on him.<br/><br/>'A Clockwork Orange' is a thought-provoking piece of film that still delivers after over 30 years. It had a powerful impact on me by the film's finale. Content wise, I don't recommend it to everyone. It is extremely graphic with strong use of sexuality and nudity. If that doesn't bother you then you should see this. It really isn't as disturbing as it sounds.<br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick, once again, gives a wonderful direction. I love the way that he directed his movies, almost all of them are great. The soundtrack is very great with Beethoven's Ninth and the film's original score. The composer of the original score, Wendy Carlos, does an excellent job of giving a haunting score.<br/><br/>The words to describe Alex De Large are sick, perverted, twisted, and despicable. I'd be surprised if anyone couldn't tell that already, even after the grin he gives to the camera after the opening credits. Alex has a wide imagination, even if his thoughts are somewhat disturbing. Malcolm McDowell plays him masterfully. I really didn't expect the movie to be like this. I expected it to be some sort of Cyber-Thriller, but it turned out to be a powerful experience.<br/><br/>This movie was adapted from the novel by Anthony Burgess. I admit, I never read the novel, but I really understood the movie. Although it is a Science Fiction movie, it never does have what most others of that genre do: which is lasers, flying objects, and epic battles. This is much different from those, and much more original.<br/><br/>'A Clockwork Orange' is one of Kubrick's best films, definitely his most thought provoking. He is one of the greatest directors in the history of film, and has given magnificent movies. I can't decide if I like this or 'Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (quite possibly THE Sci-Fi film). I will never forget the impact that 'A Clockwork Orange' had on me. 5 stars out of 5."
"djjimmyvespa","8","1","3","30 January 2006"," One of the most bizarre and unique films ever attempted
","Of course it's not perfect...how could it be? Stanley Kubrick, the obsessive-compulsive auteur was the only choice (except for Ken Russell, who would have had a ball with it) to bring Anthony Burgess's brutally compelling novel to the screen, and he does a fine job. The opening shot, of a smirking, unblinking Alex, staring down the gradually retiring camera as he drinks spiked milk prior to going on a violent rampage of vagrant-beating, gang fights, joyriding, housebreaking and rape, makes sure the film grabs you from the start and doesn't let go. And what a journey it is! A CLOCKWORK ORANGE takes in everything, and I do mean everything, from high farce, black comedy, surrealism, British smut and schaedenfreude to some of the most disturbing, troubling and thought-provoking sequences ever committed to celluloid. It's a film that delights in pulling the carpet out from beneath the viewer, again and again and again. And it works on all kinds of levels, too - beneath the 'futuristic' veneer (which, for all I know, could have already looked dated in 1971) there's a virulent satire on the sheer, eyeball-coruscating ugliness of modern architecture, particularly the neo-brutalist school of characterless concrete blocks and swathes of hideous white cement that was cropping up all over Britain at the time. Then there are the 'minimalist' interiors, hideous costumes (especially on the female characters!), Godawful pieces of pop art trash...it's clear that Kubrick really HATED this stuff, and it must have been a conscious decision for him to dump the classically-minded misfit Alex (whose taste for Beethoven and the most sordid aspects of the Bible mark him out as one who abhors a shallow modernity, and rebels against it wherever possible) in the middle of a world that's so alienating and drab. A common complaint among British youths of the seventies, the nascent 'punks' in particular, was that ""everything's crap"" - and looking at the ghastly (and surprisingly, not TOO exaggerated) world of A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, you can understand where they were coming from! I could banter about this film all day, druggies, but this is my perspective - it's one of the most vicious pieces of social satire ever created, and the legacy of the horrible world little Alex was rebelling against is still with us, decades later. Viddy well, little brothers!"

","The first time I ever saw A Clockwork Orange, it was about 11 at night, and it was on ShowCase. I had heard about this movie a lot from reading stuff on the internet, always coming across it when I was reading about something else, so curious as I am, I decided to watch it. I wasn't ready at all to see what I saw in this movie, but it's like a horrific car wreck, or a guy streaking, you just can't look away. By the time the movie was over I felt sick to my stomach, and I couldn't stop thinking about how horrible it was. But I found, the more I thought about the movie and the more I read about it, I had grown a liking to it.<br/><br/>I had become so fascinated with it, I went out and bought the book and read that, which was difficult because of the language, and it took a while to figure out what some of the words were referring to, but when I finished I was in love with the book.<br/><br/>The movie and the book are very close, with the few adjustments due to time constraints in a movie. The ending to the movie though, kind of disappointed me because the book was much more to my liking. In the end of the book, Alex ends up going back to his old ways, but now him being an adult he finds everything he use to do very juvenile, and then he decides maybe he should get a real job, find a girl and settle down. In the end of the book, he's grown out of his old ways, and I really like that aspect, and it would have been good to show in the movie.<br/><br/>A Clockwork Orange is a brilliant movie- it's colorful AND dark, comical AND horrific. Watch this movie with an open mind, and if you ever get the chance, read the book because it's more thrilling if you have the two mediums working together. A Clockwork Orange is my favorite movie and book and I recommend it to everyone- that is, if they are in a time of their life where they can handle it."

","I used fake ID to get into this movie when it first came out. I'm 50 now. At the time, this movie made me laugh, think, and shrink back into my seat. The scenes of violence were so 'in your face' for the time, and yet so....so...eeeesh.....breathtaking??? I abhor violence, and can't believe I am using the word 'breathtaking', but damn, it really was (is) amazing how Kubrick pulled it off.<br/><br/>Younger folks who watch it these days may not see the big deal about the violence as it is portrayed in the movie....which is simply a testimony to the movie's worth over time. Desensitization towards violence is a core element of the movie's point, after all.<br/><br/>I liked (*really* liked) the main character (Alex) in the movie...he is funny, quick witted, and charming. But he is also a scumbag prick bastard, and it's easy to lose sight of that. He is easily embraced while we sit in the dark and eat our popcorn, but most of us would probably go out of our f*king minds if he lived next door to us.<br/><br/>I walked away from religion as a young adult, a few years before I saw this movie. I am enjoying the view from out here to this day. However, the one person who seems to 'get it' in this movie is the prison chaplain. With all of it's visuals, and fine use of music, and great acting and directing, there *is* a point to this movie, and the chaplain articulates it. It's a simple assertion, and certainly not a new one...that people are regarded as being either ""good"" or ""bad"" based on their ability (or lack of) to make the correct choice while using their own set of ethics as arbitrator. The Catholic church **HATED** this movie when it came out, and yet it articulated the foundation of their entire credo in a favorable light. LMFAO!!!! They missed the whole point!!<br/><br/>Bottom line is that you shouldn't. This is a fantastic movie on many levels. Enjoy."
"junglejuanz","Null","1","3","5 December 2005"," My favorite film
","I first saw clips of this film as a child and like Sonny's Demise in the Godfather, I found it profoundly disturbingly violent. Let 20 years pass. Seen Eyes Wide. Watched 2001, (was finally old enough for the pace.)<br/><br/>Taxi Driver is a similar film in many ways. The difference, first off, is that Alexander Delarge is unquestionably an evil character, if he manages to play this part and through the role of a lifetime and brilliant acting make us love his performance, Malcolm, and at times sympathize and even identify with Alex. <br/><br/>This is where Alex does represent the troubled yet gifted child which had no place mere centuries ago. A futuristic symbol of industrialism's oversight of what used to be the most important part of society; family and child-rearing. Now it's all about Empires and to quote Queensryche again, ""got to make a million bucks no matter who dies.""<br/><br/>Alex separates himself through his narrative, where he admits to reveling in ultra-violence, and even fantasies about whipping Christ at his Crucifixion. Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver has angst and mental troubles, but his narrative shows he strives to be a good man.<br/><br/>So it is the combination of Mcdowell and Kubrick that get us past the shell and recognize the revelence of the treatment of the mentally unstable or misfits. McDowell and cast give us countless guilty pleasure with the aclairity with which Alex delivers his lines. I love the scene where his truant officer informs him that his victim has died, and Alex almost laughs in spite of the situation, unable to deny the genius with which Kubrick has told this story and captured it's black comedy on film.<br/><br/>Cukoo's Nest came out around the same time as well as Lucas's Thx movie, all dealing with the topic of societies ways of dealing with mental health. <br/><br/>When I first watched the movie, I thought he was still conditioned against the Ninth. It was on the next viewing I realized he had been un-conditioned and could once again enjoy Beethoven. No matter the character of Alex, Kubrick and Mcdowell did indeed pull off one of the best films ever."

","For those who don't know, the film 'a clockwork orange' is actually based on the book of the same title by Anthony Burgess. The film itself is effective, well made and deals with most of the issues that the book does. It does seem to have become slightly dated as time has worn on, and a lot less shocking to modern audiences, but it still manages to create controversy and has had lasting popularity. I watched this film a while after reading the book and although the actual movie is good in it's own right, compared to the book it's quite tame and uninteresting. One example of this would be the girls Alex rapes. In the film they appear to be at least 15, however in the book they are described as being around 10; personally i find that a lot more shocking. In all, this is a good film. It is well directed and well acted. However, if you are really interested in the story, i would suggest reading the book with it's ingenious use of new language and real shocking power, it makes for a very good read."
"rrudder","10","1","3","14 September 2005"," Fantastic.
","First let me say this much, I've never been a huge fan of movies that invoke a lot of thought, but this movie is an exception. The movie is amazing, not on a material level, but almost on a subconscious level. It's something about the movie that leaves you feeling as you've never felt before. Why? Because the movie is like nothing ever made before. It is a amazingly original. The music and pictures intricately connect with each other in a way that I've never seen before. Alex DeLarge is an incredibly deep and well portrayed character. He is a character that you are currently having to change your viewpoint towards. I don't know what it is, but despite Alex's violence in the beginning of the film, he is not a hated character. You feel almost an indifference to hi min his droogies, almost as if they are mere helpless products of society, with little ability to change the course of their actions. Once the story progresses, however, you start to feel sorry for him as he experiences hardships. He is eager to change, but is constantly struck back by the actions of his past. I wasn't sure what I'd think of the movie before I started watching it, as I have never read the book. The movie however is a clear cut, amazing piece of art work that is hardly rivaled by any other movie. The mood of the movie is an odd juxtaposition of good and evil, an interesting look into the fruits of irresponsible society. Escpecially relevant in today's society.<br/><br/>However, I must warn the movie does contain some graphic violence (including rape) and nudity. If you are sensitive to such things I wouldn't suggest watching the movie."
"altcontrolsdelete","10","1","3","7 August 2005"," Only one film can be considered ""perfect"".
","And this is it.<br/><br/>What can a mere mortal say about this film? Stanley was a god among men, and this was without question his defining work. This story (not to mention his numerous other marvelous works) also cements Anthony Burgess's place as one of the greatest authors of the period. Honestly, if this film doesn't reach into the core of your being and make you think about what you are, there is nothing that will.<br/><br/>Burgess's story and Kubrick's vision are unmatched; a completely uninhibited and unfettered look at what makes a man and how fragile his humanity is. We can thank Burgess for bringing the viciousness and helplessness of humanity to light, and we can thank Kubrick for bringing it to our attention.<br/><br/>From the haunting scene of Alex in the milkbar to the ashamedly thrilling scene of Alex in his own personal heaven, Kubrick captures the very best and the very worst of what defines us as humans. The animalistic nature of man is presented beautifully among Alex and his droogs through the fight with Billy Boy and his droogs, the rape of the author's wife, and the murder of the cat lady.<br/><br/>Even more brutal is the attempt at Alex's reform, and that's where the message of the story and the film begin to make the reader/viewer sympathetic to the brutal force that is Alex. Until the realization of Alex's torture at the hand of the government it is impossible to sympathize with Alex's behavior, as it is simply despicable. But, more despicable is his reform -- death would have been a more humane punishment.<br/><br/>To try and explain or review the film is ultimately unfruitful. Each viewer will have his or her own takeaway, and it will either be revelation or disdain. It's simply a story that must be viewed with an emotional detachment to be accepted, and an emotional attachment to be understood. Thus, it's a film far too difficult for those unable to make the connection and disconnection simultaneously.<br/><br/>Kubrick's genius does justice to Burgess's own, and I'm left saddened that the two never directly collaborated. One can only imagine what the fruit of a collaboration similar to Kubrick and Clarke's on 2001 would have been. For that matter, one can only be disappointed by the omission of the 21st chapter of Burgess's work, but you must also wonder what the cost to the film version would have been, had Kubrick been made aware of the chapter. Honestly, I can't imagine the film being better than it is, nor is the novel complete without the view into the life of a mature Alexander de Large.<br/><br/>Perfection comes along a great once in a while. This is the very definition of the word, and I think that this film serves to segregate those who ""get it"" from those who don't."

","This has to be the most unique film I've ever seen. From it's stunning and sometimes disturbing visuals, to it's dialog, A Clockwork Orange keeps you engrossed for the whole time. Taking place in the near future, this film follows Alex and his gang of Droogs as they commit acts of atrocities in an attempt to look for the good old ""ultra-violence"". Alex is later arrested and put through this revolutionary rehabilitation center where the people try to ""correct"" all the evil that is in him. Without giving away too much of it, this movie primarily appealed to me because it was nothing that I had ever seen before and I was shocked to see that this movie was made back in 1971.

","This is a beautiful, beautiful film. It shows how humans behave in the real world and doesn't compromise one inch of truth in doing this. It tells the story of a young man who's daily way of life involves gang warfare, drugs, rape, and listening to Beethoven. The central character, Alex, doesn't see himself as bad. However the society around him thinks otherwise and he eventually gets caught and locked up for his crimes.<br/><br/>He's sentenced to 14 years in prison for ""the accidental killing of a person"" and one day a government minister visits the prison in order to look for a suitable candidate for a new experimental form of treatment which is supposed to stop a criminal from committing crimes and turn him into a functional member of society.<br/><br/>Because of his outgoing personality, and the fact that he's still a vicious young hoodlum at heart, Alex is the one who they pick as the guinea-pig for this new therapy.<br/><br/>After undergoing 2 weeks of being strapped to a chair and forced to watch movies of rape and violence whilst having a paralysing serum injected into his body and his eyes kept permanently open thanks to a set of ""lid-locks"", our hero is transformed out of all recognition.<br/><br/>Now a mentally crippled member of society who is free to roam the streets again, the people he terrorized in the past come back to take their revenge on him. Helpless, homeless, and unable to listen to the music he loves without getting sick, Alex decides to take the ultimate step and end his own life.<br/><br/>However, although badly bruised and with many bones broken, he survives the jump out of a third-storey window, and as he lies in hospital physically recovering, he is also recovering mentally from the ""treatment"" and is starting to once again feel twitches of desire for the old ""Ultra-Violence"" and we see him become happier and stronger. At the last moment in the movie we see a strange look on his face as he revels in Beethoven's 9th symphony while having a fantasy about having sex with a woman while people stand around and applaud him, We know and he knows he's cured.<br/><br/>That brief summary doesn't do justice to the movie, or the book for that matter. Once you see ""A Clockwork Orange"" you'll never look at life the same way again. See it a few times and it becomes part of you. It shows you the intangible things everybody in the world spends most of their time talking about, but nobody can explain. It shows you what people mean when they say they ""made it"" in life, It shows you why people that don't show fear ultimately don't get picked on, regardless of physical size, about why honesty about one's vices will always lead to you being hailed as a hero, regardless of how despicable those vices are."

","#1 Best Film of 1971<br/><br/>There are many great filmmakers who are unfortunately not alive today. There was Hitchcock, Curtiz, DeMille, and the list goes on and on. Eventually you'll get to Stanley Kubrick, director of such films as 2001: A Space Odyssey, Dr. Strangelove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the , Full Metal Jacket, Barry Lyndon, and my personal favorite, A Clockwork Orange. Out of all the filmmakers to ever live, I always thought Kubrick was the finest. His meticulous and carefully crafted works of art (his films) are superior to any other filmmaker on a good day (in my opinion). Out of all his incredible achievements, I find the best is 'A Clockwork Orange', the controversial - Best Picture nominee about in youth in our society, well a future society.<br/><br/>In futuristic Britian, young Alexander DeLarge (Malcom McDowell) and his droogies enjoy pranks, robbing, izing, , spiked milk and 'a bit of the old ultra '. One day while Alex and his crew (Dim, Georgie, and Lodger) are izing and eventually ing a ""dirty old sumka"" with a lot of cats, Alex's crew decides to turn against him, and leaving him alone at the scene for the cops to come. Young and trouble-making Alex's life gets turned upside down when he goes to prison. In prison he becomes very interested in religion and the and pain Christ went through. Not because of sorrow for Christ, but because of his obsession with inflicting upon people. He day-dreams of being a Roman, whipping Jesus while he carries the cross, and having s with the temple chambermaids. One day, Alex comes across an experimental medical procedure that supposedly cures violent criminals, and decides to take up the offer so he can get out of jail. The rest of the film follows him in the procedure and the consequences, hardships and situations that follow. <br/><br/>'A Clockwork Orange' is such a well-made production it almost can't even be considered a film, it should be considered a work of art. Stanley Kubrick beautifully molds this dark, dim and disturbing tale based on Anthony Burgess' novel, and turns it into his own glorious vision. Kubrick achieves utter and absolute perfection in his direction, and he also provides a magnificent screenplay filled to the brim with intriguing almost Shakespeare-ish sort of dialogue in which Alex speaks. The acting is a cut above the rest also. Malcolm McDowell owns the role of Alex DeLarge, and plays him with intensity, passion, great understanding and an almost shocking realism. You don't see Mr. McDowell on the screen, you see his character Alexander DeLarge, a young mischievous monster in the making. The film also stars Patrick Magee, Warren Clarke, Carl Duering, Adrienne Corri, Anthony Sharp, James Marcus, and Michael Bates in a very comedic role as chief guard at Alex's prison. The film garners neat cinematography, awesome set decoration, interesting costumes and a highly inventive and exceptional vision thanks to the brilliant Stanley Kubrick.<br/><br/>'A Clockwork Orange' is my favorite Kubrick film, and that is saying a hell of a lot. Others may not agree because it doesn't have the awe of '2001' or the cult following of 'Dr. Strangelove'. I love it to though, because it's so different then his (Kubrick's) other work and that is what makes it so special. It was one of the most controversial films of the 1970s because of it's extreme and , and it had to be cut from it's original version (now restored on DVD today) to receive an 'R' rating it all along deserved. In conclusion, this is an incredible work of art (one of the two only - features to be nominated for the Oscar for Best Picture) that will be adored by the film buffs and detested by the weak-hearted. I highly recommend it. Grade: A<br/><br/>MADE MY TOP 300 LIST AT #12"

","""A Clockwork Orange"" never fails to polarize its audience. It seems that the viewer ship of this film either loves it or loathes it. Some (I among them) salivate over Kubrick's complete mastery of the film medium while others want to burn the film as morally dubious at best and repugnant at worst. The criticisms I hear most often leveled at the film concern the fact that Kubrick has us sympathizing with a young punk whose favorite pastime is violence (any kind, including beatings, rapes, bludgeonings and stabbings). I do agree that we sympathize with Alex, the film's main character, but I disagree that this is to the film's detriment. The movie, like the book on which it is based, is told essentially in first person. Alex narrates the film, and we never see an event occur that Alex himself is not present to witness. Even the mise-en-scene of the film (the distorted angles, stylized sets, use of slow and fast motion, etc.) lend the film a subjectivity and reminds the audience that it is seeing events unfold through a perspective other than its own.<br/><br/>I think anyone with a shred of humanity will sympathize with Alex; I think that's the movie's point. Alex treats others as if they are animals, and we are repelled by it. Then, when the state treats him as if he is just another animal, why should we not be just as repelled? In some ways, the questions this film poses can have practical applications to the ongoing debate over the death penalty. Does recoiling at the idea of putting someone to death mean that we condone the crimes he or she committed to have that sentence brought against them in the first place?<br/><br/>I want to save my last comment for Malcolm McDowell's unimprovable performance. I can't imagine anyone playing Alex better than he does. He's got the perfect blend of charm, charisma and menace that this character needs. His performance is comedic and scary at the same time. It's a shame that he didn't receive more recognition for this film when it was released.<br/><br/>Grade: A"

"slokes","8","1","3","1 March 2005"," Malcolm In The Middle
","People sometimes call ""A Clockwork Orange"" their favorite Stanley Kubrick film. Me too, except higher praise in my book is that it's my favorite Malcolm McDowell film. McDowell's portrayal of a vicious young hood up against a system every bit as cruel is what draws me in, and keeps drawing me in, time and again.<br/><br/>McDowell is a young fellow named Alex, who in a vaguely futuristic society goes gallivanting off on assorted crimes with his equally nasty mates until he finds himself in the hands of justice. To get out of prison, Alex volunteers for a new mind-altering technique designed to rid him of his antisocial impulses. But is the cure worse than the crime?<br/><br/>One of only two X-rated films ever to be Oscar-nominated for best picture, ""Clockwork Orange"" has lost none of its ability to shock in the more than 30 years since its release. It still attracts hard-core fans while offending others. I used to be a bigger fan, back when I was a college boy. I even took a first date to see this. Needless to say, there wasn't a second date, though it's not only for that ""Clockwork Orange"" hasn't aged for me as well as some other films I can mention.<br/><br/>It's a very good film all the same. Kubrick's perversity and his structured style of storytelling are well tailored to an Anthony Burgess novel that operates like a boomerang cuckoo clock. The music by Walter Carlos, re-fangled classical melodies served up electronically, works very well with the slightly putrid color scheme and odd lighting to create a sense of prevailing unease throughout. In his other works, Kubrick too often tended to elicit either mechanical or hyper-emotional performances from his actors, but with the exception of Patrick Magee's embarrassing turn as one of Alex's victims, the approach actually works here because the film itself is something of a satire, boldly comical even in depicting brutal crimes like the murder of a cat-loving woman with a giant ceramic, um, sculpture.<br/><br/>But what makes ""Clockwork Orange"" worth repeat viewings, more than Kubrick's cleverness, is McDowell's lead performance. Though we get an education right at the beginning just how terrible a person little Alex is, McDowell invests him with such charisma, wit, and even grace that we kind of gravitate to him despite ourselves. ""Don't sing that song in the bathtub, Alex!"" ""Watch out for that milk bottle!"" There's no reason we shouldn't wish Alex his instant karma, yet the lively McDowell gives us someone to perversely root for. His narration, like Richard III's, is a marvel of mordant sympathy-stealing.<br/><br/>While the film raises questions about the necessity of being able to choose good or evil in order to be human, and how society casually corrupts the individual, I have a sneaking suspicion a lot of people gravitate to this film because it serves up generous helpings of nudity and ultra violence under a decorous umbrella of deep thought and even a vague spiritual dimension courtesy of the prison charlie. Kubrick knew how to make a trip in the gutter seem elevating.<br/><br/>However absorbing it is in all its parts, ""Clockwork Orange"" is a one-man show, and for me that man is Malcolm McDowell. The way he smiles so menacingly yet with real allure, wipes a smear of spit off his face, screams out how he's seen the light while undergoing the Ludovico treatment, and maintains his weird bond with us the viewer is a marvel of morality-warping brilliance. McDowell had other great roles, but Alex is one for the ages. Is there anyone else who could make corruption seem so refreshing?"
"El_Rey_De_Movies","10","1","3","16 February 2005"," A brutally violent yet intellectually challenging classic
","It amazes me how a movie like this, which was so hugely controversial when it was released, can be so completely ignored now by the average movie watcher. Kubrick was widely reviled because of the way he pushed the boundaries of what was considered ""acceptable"" in movies  specifically, sex and violence, the two-headed cultural Hydra that continues to fascinate and repel us. Although I've read a number of reviews that chastise the film for being ""old hat"" and really no big deal here at the beginning of the 21st Century, I have to admit that this picture is still as shocking, brutal, comic, nihilistic, and philosophically challenging now as it was in 1971  and if someone tells you different, then get the hell away from that person because they've become so desensitized to violence that they'd probably think that the 5-car pileup they just passed was faked because the blood didn't look real! But under all the violence, what Kubrick gave us is a parable, narrated by Malcolm McDowell like some demented younger brother of Fielding's Tom Jones, about choice. The plot is the story of Alex, a young ne'er-do-well living off his parents in a cookie-cutter flat in a slightly-futuristic London who cuts class during the day and hangs out at night with his ""droogs"" in a bar where they serve milk laced with various drugs  which is just a prelude for ""a bit of the old ultra-violence"", as Alex calls it. Kubrick shows their various escapades and adventures, that escalate from a simple joyride to a rumble...to a harrowing home invasion where Alex sings ""Singin' in the Rain"" while beating the living crap out of the writer who lives there  which is then followed by a ball gag in his mouth so he can watch Alex and his gang beat and gang-rape his wife. Eventually, the gang turns on Alex because he's an arrogant, supercilious, conceited, manipulative son of a bitch who's not above sending his cane crashing into the balls of his gang-mates to assert his authority as leader. They set him up with a little breaking-and-entering action which Alex, sadist that he is, turns into a murder when he assaults the woman who lives there with a statue of a giant penis! He's convicted and sent to prison for 15 years, and normally that would be the end for someone like him. But not for our little hero, who discovers that he has an untapped talent for hypocrisy, a talent that he uses to manipulate the prison chaplain into making him first his assistant and then to get him accepted into the ""Ludovico Treatment"". Of course Alex doesn't care what the treatment is  all he cares about is that it will get him out of prison, permanently, in a fortnight, as a completely rehabilitated member of society. But, for once, Alex has outfoxed himself. The treatment is not some simple psychological counseling and job-training program  it's a new and radical method of re-sensitizing an individual, essentially a kind of massive negative reinforcement towards sex and violence. And THAT'S where the crux of the picture, the essence of Kubrick's argument lies. The treatment makes Alex physically sick and induces suicidal tendencies when he tries to act violently or engage in sexual activity, which makes him ""cured"" in the eyes of society and the government. But, as the chaplain says, he has lost the ability to choose his behavior and, in the end, isn't that the only thing that distinguishes man from beast? It isn't intelligence, it isn't laughter, it isn't the opposable thumb  it's the fact that, for human beings, there is really no such thing as instinctive behavior. Alex has not learned that his behavior is wrong, objectionable, evil  all he's learned is that if he tries to act that way, he'll feel like retching and killing himself. He's simply been programmed to respond in a specific way to specific stimuli, not to make any kind of moral choice. And not only is it not a permanent solution, it also has the unintended consequence of taking Beethoven's music away from Alex, who just loves ""Ludwig van"" but can't listen to the 9th Symphony anymore because it was the background music the treatment used! Filmed in Kubrick's signature chillingly documentary style, it's a picture that will make you laugh, cringe, but most of all, think."

","***Spoilers***<br/><br/>I thought this was an awesome movie the first time I saw it, but I can see why people wouldn't. I still remember it vividly. There is, as the rating says, a lot of violence, nudity, and suggested rape, and it is partly this that makes the movie such a big hit.<br/><br/>My personal feeling on the movie? It was awkward, but extremely thought provoking. The ""ultra-violence"" didn't bug me as much as the boys' indifference did to it. The way they made beating people, no matter how old, the way they used sympathy to gain entrance into a house, just to beat the old man and rape his wife. I have not been able to hear ""Singing in the rain...I'm just singing in the rain."" since without thinking of this movie. It made me think differently of things I had always thought perfectly innocent.<br/><br/>Ten minutes into the film, I was on the edge of my seat-though not quite literally-waiting to see what happened. It was flexible, and could have gone either way. Throughout the film, I wasn't able to guess what came next, the way a person can for a cheesier movie, and I loved it.<br/><br/>The setting is futuristic, but not like the others I've seen. It doesn't focus as much as the way of life or government, and it may be possible to think the story is happening in the present. The setting is also a bit queer; in the milk bar, there are naked statues, where milk is squeezed from the woman's breasts. The main character's apartment is fairly run down on the external, and on pictures of nude individuals on the outside, there is a fair amount of graffiti, the kind that could be found scrawled in school textbooks.<br/><br/>I found the main character, Alex, endearing in an odd sort of way. While he could do cruel acts in cold blood, he always answered promptly when spoken to, usually with an added ""Yes ma'am"" or ""Yes sir"" so crisp that it would make your shirts jealous. This is one of the principal things I remember about the film.<br/><br/>The brainwashing that Alex undergoes is just awesome. When it is over, he is unable to beat anyone, unable to touch a naked woman, is even forced to lick an officials shoe. He can no longer hurt anyone.<br/><br/>But when he gets out of prison, it's only to beat nearly drowned to death by his old thug friends. When he tries to return home, it's only to find that his room has been rented out. It's only when he's in the rain, trying to find a warm place to stay, that he's taken in by an old man that doesn't recognize him for who he was; the Alex that beat him and raped his wife.<br/><br/>The end is also interesting. It's fair for the old man to want the Alex dead, is it not, after Alex raped his wife and confined him to a wheelchair? Yet there is also the political undertone, wanting him dead to prove that the brainwashing the new government had done to him was cruel and unjust.<br/><br/>But Alex doesn't manage to die, and it is the new government themselves who pay for his hospitalization. (Correct me if I'm wrong in any of this, it's been a fair few months since I saw it.) They also repeal their brainwashing, and manage to cure Alex of his. It is this part that makes one wonder, is it a favor or a curse? Once Alex is free of his brainwashing, he is free to pursuit any hobby he wishes; including those that got him in trouble to begin with. His smile at the end of the movie is both ecstatic and sinister."

","(minor spoilers)<br/><br/>Many people appreciate this film, if only for its shock value. The controversial subject matter in this film is indeed a merit, but this is not the only reason this is such a great film. Many people as well think that this movie is too violent, and just a lame excuse to shock and disturb people. I do not agree with this. <br/><br/>As I am sure has been mentioned countless times, this film criticizes society as well as human nature. It asks the viewer if what is being performed on Alex, which is designed to make him a ""good"" person, is moral or the right thing to do. It also suggests that society is cruel and unforgiving. Note that upon Alex's return to his home, people constantly beat him, when he is now ""good"" and quite defenseless. Sometimes, society doesn't give you a second chance. Alex is left defenseless under society's bitterness. But does he deserve this treatment for the crimes he committed? These questions and others the film asks, making it a thought-provoking film. This is a huge merit. <br/><br/>I also believe that the film-making in this movie is excellent. Stanely Kubrick was a master filmmaker. The opening shot, which opens up on Alex and slowly zooms out, is great and absolutely genius. <br/><br/>So, if you are the mood to see a movie that is excellently filmed, though-provoking, saddening, disturbing, and even sometimes ""funny"", see ""A Clockwork Orange""."

I also at times felt that some characters were portrait very differently than I had perceived them while reading the book. Still I think Kubrick really did a good job bring this piece of literature into a different medium.

And then you can imagine the horrible things that Alex does. For example, he and his ""droog"" of friends break into a writer's house, beat him up, and then rape his wife. Who wants to see that happen? No one. So why bother making it? So Mr. Stanley Kubrick would have more excuses to make films with violence and sex so the audience would get used to it. Malcolm McDowell's narration is useless, and perhaps it would have been better without it. Overall, stay away from this repulsive mess.<br/><br/>0/5 stars."

First of all it is by far the most original and inovative movie of the 1970's. Second, it's crude humor that I don't personally think was meant to be there makes up for its ultra violence and sexuality.

"andrew7","10","1","3","27 February 2002"," Challenging
","This is probably the most intellectually challenging film I've ever seen. I'm really not sure I understand more than a handful of what's happening in this film.  I mean, the story is easy enough to follow, and several of the themes become apparent on repeated viewings, but a lot of peculiarities remain.  Much of the supporting cast performs their roles with a high degree of stylized exaggeration.  I'm not sure what Kubrick was going after with all of this.<br/><br/>Still, at the very least, it's a damn good film that I really enjoy watching.  <br/><br/>But every time I do, I'm thrust back into that dame dilemma.  What does the ending of this film signify?  Clearly, Alex has managed to indulge in thoughts of a highly anti-social nature without being torn apart.  So, the effects of the Ludovico treatment are gone.  So, what now?  The legendary story of the censored final chapter of Burgess's novel has this answer.  To viewers who complain about the abrupt ending, you have government censorship of literature to thank.  I know what Burgess's take on this was, having familiarized myself with the true ending of the story.  But what is Kubrick's take?  What does Kubrick think he is saying with this film?  Has Alex learned something from his ordeal?  It looks like he has not, in which case, the only point of the film seems to be that it is better to be free and evil than a good slave.  On this level, the film is more relevant now, in this age of personality- altering drugs people take for depression or ADD.  Is complete loss of self to high a price to pay for the elimination of undesirable behavior?<br/><br/>The film is an excellent jumping off point for the topic of criminal justice.  Specifically, what is the purpose of incarceration?  Do we imprison criminals in order to protect society from them?  To reform them? Or to have revenge upon them?  It's a particularly fascinating question here in America, since the Death Penalty is still a very living issue for us. You can find in this film loads of material to fuel an energetic discussion on the topic.  <br/><br/>But again, I'm at a loss to understand what the driector had in mind.  It doesn't concern me.  This film is thought-provoking.  When I watch it, or even think on it, my mind spirals off into all sorts of issues raised by it. I don't know which issues, or which positions, the director intended to support, if any.  And I don't care.  It is enough, in my view, that the film provokes thought and discussion.  <br/><br/>Added to that, it is simply an enjoyable film to watch, with an intriguing (if slowly developed) story.  The structure of the film is beautiful. Slowly, patiently, it builds up an intimate portrait of Alex's pre-prison life.  Then, slowly and patiently, it takes us with Alex through prison, through the Ludovico treatment, and to his eventual release.  Then, in the third act, it slowly and patiently takes us back again through his previous crimes.  Encounters with his parents, with his former friends, and with his former victims tell another story.  The one thing that I do think the film is saying, quite clearly, is that people have a natural, emotional desire for animalistic revenge.  Toss out the high-minded theories we were discussing earlier.  When we hurt, we need to make someone else hurt worse.   <br/><br/>As usual, a very dark, pessimistic film about the terrible flaws in human nature."

","The movie begins. What do we see? A young man, Alex DeLarge (Malcom McDowell), is looking at us as if he's got some kind of grudge against us, and he's got his right eye's eyelashes covered with mascara. Kubrick keeps it like this for a while, and then slowly zooms out. Alex picks up a glass of milk and drinks from it; and what do we see? Naked women posing and being used as tables! They are just statues of course. What kind of women could stay in such a position? This is a STRANGE movie, strange, as you can plainly see, in caps. ALL in caps. He beats a woman with a statue of a penis! What the hell is that all about?! They could of had a statue of Venis DeMilo, or David, but a penis? My God! They make the man dislike Beethoven; what is so bad about Beethoven? Beehtoven, Mozart, Bach, all of the masters of the classical music genre rock!

The characters were not what I call believable, nor was the acting very good. A lame story line from what I saw. Did not hold my attention and after a half an hour of mindless dribble I shut it off.

"jboothmillard","8","2","10","12 July 2005"," A Clockwork Orange
","This film was initially a huge success when released, but when news broke out of two horrific copycat incidents, it was immediately banned by its own director, Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Stanley Kubrick (The Shining, Full Metal Jacket). It was only after his death in 1999 that the film was allowed to be released to the public on home video and DVD, but even before the ban, and today, it is considered a cult classic. Basically it is a futuristic Britain, where Alex De Large (Golden Globe nominated Malcolm McDowell) is the leader of a teenage gang of hooligans, the ""Droogs"", who go out every night carrying out acts of ""ultraviolence"" for fun. They attack an innocent old Tramp (Paul Farrell), attack old author Mr. Alexander (Patrick Magee) and rape his wife in their own home, and Alex murders a woman in her home with a giant phallic sculpture. Alex is sentenced to fourteen years, and after two he hears of a new experimental cure for prisoners that would get him out within two weeks, it is called the Ludovico Technique. It is a treatment where they clamp his eyes open and force him to watch horrific ultra-violent and rape crime, and coincidently the music playing is Alex's favourite composer, Ludwig Van Beethoven's 9th Symphony. The treatment is complete and Alex is shown to show extreme sickness when being faced with violence either to or from himself, and when he wants to caress a woman. Alex is released as a cured man, but his past comes back to haunt him when people he knew from his thug days make his new life torture. This includes the old tramp rounding up many others to attack him, Alex's thugs turned cops Georgie (James Marcus) and Dim (Warren Clarke), and most awful of all the mad Mr. Alexander torturing him with the 9th Symphony. It is the point of hearing the torturous music that Alex sees no other way out but suicide, but after jumping out of the window, he only breaks all his limbs. In the end, the experimental cure is abolished, Mr. Alexander is imprisoned for madness, and Alex rests in hospital knowing that he is now truly cured with his dark imagination. Also starring Michael Bates as Chief Guard, Worzel Gummidge's Anthony Sharp as Minister, Philip Stone as Dad, Sheila Raynor as Mum, Michael Tarn as Pete, Steven Berkoff as Constable, Star Wars' Dave Prowse as Julian and Coronation Street's John Savident as Conspirator. The most disturbing scenes of the film, before the nasty musical torture and clamping eyes, they are in the first thirty or so minutes. These are seeing a tramp very badly beaten, an old man attacked and his wife raped while Alex is singing the happy song ""Singin' in the Rain"", and the murder with the giant penis. The lead character and his friends speaking like old fashioned slang-spouting yobs is interesting when you consider it is meant to be a near future. This film is up there with Natural Born Killers, accused of glorifying violence (and rape), and it is also debated whether this is really a masterpiece, I would say if it gets many people talking and making an impact in Kubrick's career, then I believe it is. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Film Editing, Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium and Best Picture, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing, Best Screenplay, Best Sound Track and Best Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama. Alex De Large was number 12 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, the film was number 21 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, it was number 54 on The Ultimate Film, and it was number 7 on The 50 Greatest British Films.

","Any movie that was panned by Pauline Kael, Andrew Sarris, and Roger Ebert can't be all bad, can it? A Clockwork Orange remains one of Stanley Kubrick's most popular films, with an 8.4 rating on IMDb and a 90% fresh rating (93% audience score) on Rotten Tomatoes. I think it's a tribute to Kubrick that the movie can elicit such widely divergent responses. I can see what Kael, Sarris, and Ebert are complaining about while at the same time admitting that the film is undeniably entertaining in a ""horrorshow"" way: that being both novelist Anthony Burgess's Nadsat coinage from the Russian word ""khorosho,"" meaning ""good,"" and the English literal sense. For it is a kind of horror movie, with Alex (Malcom McDowell) as the monster spawned by modern society -- implacable, controlled only by the most drastic and abhorrent means, in this case a kind of behavioral conditioning. Watching it this time I was struck by how much the aversion therapy to which Alex is subjected reminds me of the attempts to convert gay people to heterosexuality. Which is not to say that Kubrick's film isn't exploitative in the extreme, relying on images of violence and sexuality that almost justify Kael's suggestion that Kubrick is a kind of failed pornographer. It is not the kind of movie that should go without what today are called ""trigger warnings."" What's good about A Clockwork Orange is certainly Malcolm McDowell's performance as Alex, one of the few really complex human beings in Kubrick's caricature-infested films. Some of his most memorable scenes in the movie were partly improvised, as when he sings ""Singin' in the Rain"" during his attack on the Alexanders, and when he opens his mouth like a bird when the minister of the interior is feeding him. Kubrick received three Oscar nominations, as producer, director, and screenwriter, and film editor Bill Butler was also nominated, but the movie won none, losing in all four categories to The French Connection (William Friedkin, 1971). It deserved nominations not only for McDowell, but also for John Alcott's cinematography and John Barry's production design. (charlesmatthews.blogspot.com)"

","There were two reasons I went to see this film at the Warner West End the week it was released, in no particular order, 1. Stanley Kubrick, I had been mesmerised by 2001, having seen it in Cinerama, if only I could see it again in this format. I'd seen Paths of Glory and Sparticus but being very young at the time I didn't associate these two great films with Kubrick. So a new film by this director was a must to see.<br/><br/>2. Malcolm McDowell, 'If' was a very surreal experience that I can watch, like 2001 and Clockwork Orange, time after time. So the combination of the two was a match made in heaven. It is a shame that McDowell didn't go on to be a huge star, sometimes being reduced to C list productions that weren't worthy of his talent.<br/><br/>Kubrick's style and attention to detail have been copied many times since but as far as I am concerned he is up there as one of the greats. The fact that he never won an Oscar as best director is another travesty of Hollywoood.<br/><br/>I don't need to give a breakdown of the story line here, if you don't know by now you never will. The violence is tame now compared to hundreds of other more recent films but that is not what you watch it for.<br/><br/>It's simply a masterpiece of film making.<br/><br/>It's up there in my top ten of the greatest films ever, if I could give eleven I would."

","Director Kenneth Branagh and screenwriter Chris Weitz clearly have tried to bring the old story into line with 21st century feminist values: Far from a passive victim waiting to be saved by the handsome prince, their Cinderella is a paragon of quiet integrity and insight. But the lovely and fundamentally uninteresting James is no match for the fire and elemental venom exuded by Cate Blanchett's evil stepmother, who is by far the film's most interesting character. With her chartreuse and green wardrobe, scarlet gash of a rictus grin and darting fits of cruelty, she seems to have beamed into ""Cinderella"" as if from a 1950s Douglas Sirk melodrama into a cozy Merchant Ivory period drama.<br/><br/>Branagh tries his best to infuse ""Cinderella"" with energy, from having his characters compulsively swirl and spin in otherwise static scenes to the palace intrigue and power plays that take the place of conventional romance. He even tries to inject some humor (yes, that's Rob Bryden in a cameo role, and Helena Bonham Carter hiding behind a hideous pair of prosthetic teeth), but to no avail."

","Kubrick set a new era in shock film making, in what can only be described, as a true original, a bold, brilliant, and sick twisted masterpiece with color. Four neanderthals, led by Alex (a brilliant Macdowell at his finest, through which the story is narrated in it's wonderfully brilliant dialogue of script) get their kicks, looting, beating up people, rape, what have you, until Mcdowell stuffs up badly and going too far, resulting i the taking of a life. Mcdowell's is sent to a prison, then a hospital, where his punishment becomes his treatment, where he voluntarily undertakes all these horrible experiments, that will hopefully rid and cure him, of all this impurity and evil, one horrible exercise has him forced to viddy all these sick films where he can't turn away, as having his eyes clamped open. Reformed, back in the public sector, he begins to sense somethings not right, as in his treatment, where he's suffering stomach cramps, whatever, and is not really expecting the quite cold or passive reception he gets from his folks + a new border. What did they really do to him in that hospital. ACO does ride high on style, so many wonderful images, you get off this film, like the nude statues in the milk bar, from which you obtain your daily source of nourishment in terms of milk and shakes. That fast forwarding rape scene was stupid though, I have to fault it, where I can't believe someone was actually affected by this scene. The scene I was much affected, where again, it pains me to think of, was one of Alex's droogies, getting whacked in the nuts, by Alex's stick, and flying side off into that fountain. Of course this undying hit won't sot well with everyone. It will disturb and challenge. I know people who hate the film, one person, saying it was the worst movie, he ever saw. This one, is in the eye of the beholder. You can't fault it's originality, and one that decides to push the envelope, so to speak. Mcdowell's performance is just a masterpiece, and honestly in spite of Alex's cruelty and wrong doings on others. we can't help feeling a bit sorry for the sod, who we really see get his act together, but it's here in the aftermath of his prison/hospital time, where a nice little spin, twist has been put on the story. It's funny too, without really meaning to be, but the onus here, is put on Mcdowell mainly, in how he brilliantly delivers some of his dialogue. An enticing R Rated experience, all the way. The film is just not for everyone. Mainly it's the color of the film that will stay with ya, in Kubrick's finest hour."
"bowmanblue","10","1","4","9 November 2014"," Horrifically hypnotising
","'A Clockwork Orange' was famously 'banned' by its director, Stanley Kubrick soon after its release. This gave it an instant 'cult' appeal as many wanted to know why a film-maker should go to such unusual lengths with his own work.<br/><br/>It some ways, it's easy to see why it was taken out of general circulation. It is horribly violent. Its central character offers absolutely nothing in the way of likability. He's a violent robber, rapist, gang-member and murderer. And, perhaps worst of all, he never seems that bothered by his own actions - simply enjoying them as you would any hobby.<br/><br/>Some may say it's hard to root for such a vile 'hero' yet we do. Despite his numerous evil traits, he's also entertaining, charming and a most memorable leading man. Therefore, we may hate him, we may also be desperate for him to receive some retribution, yet we find ourselves wanting to find out what becomes of him. This - in many ways - is down to Malcolm McDowell's excellent acting, but Kubrick's direction is also key to making this such a work of art.<br/><br/>The film is weird and timeless, much of it looking like the seventies has been transported a hundred years into the future. Everything from the language to the hairstyles says 'science fiction.' It really does create a weird and creepy atmosphere.<br/><br/>You don't have to like A Clockwork Orange, you just have to appreciate that it is a work of 'art' and, like all great art, is subject to controversy. Many hate it and I can understand why. The overall violence of the film does leave a bitter taste in your mouth. If you're considering watching it, you may need a strong stomach. However, if you can put aside the nastiness of it all, you'll find a weirdly entertaining film of which you've probably never seen anything like it before."

"thediggens","9","1","4","24 June 2014"," A difficult, but rewarding viewing experience
","A Clockwork Orange is an unsettling exploration of violence within society by the technical master Stanley Kubrick. It is easily his most controversial film, which in a repertoire including Lolita & Eyes Wide Shut, among others, is impressive. The film does not shy away from violence or sex (though certainly its violence is no more graphic than some of its contemporaries, and it is only the sexual content which would still be considered mildly graphic today); indeed, it basks in them.<br/><br/>The film follows Alex De Large (a perfect performance by Malcolm Mcdowell), too depraved to be considered protagonist, too charismatic (and later, sympathetic) to be considered a villain- though one likely would lean towards the latter- as he first goes about his violent escapades with his 'droogs', and later at his incarceration and 'rehabilitation'. What first begins purely as a look at depraved violence takes on a political and social angle as it explores psychology, morality and nature by virtue of the now-infamous 'Ludovico' treatment, and its consequences. While some films merely ask questions, A Clockwork Orange certainly leans towards providing answers. It suggests a firm belief in the artificiality of the treatment's results, and particularly their use as a means to a political end- there are certainly echoes of 1984-style totalitarianism in the treatment's implied purposes.<br/><br/>Like many of Kubrick's filmography, the film is technically a masterpiece. The visuals and the editing are top notch, with nary a wasted shot in sight. But special mention must go to the use of sound, with a soundtrack primarily composing of the work of Beethoven, which Alex is enamoured by. Its use within scenes (the threesome and the riverside fight in particular) is pitch perfect, at times supremely unsettling and at others morbidly comedic.<br/><br/>Yet while as technically perfect as Kubrick ever was, like many of his films it seems emotionally hollow. The characters and story are distant, and one can struggle to immerse oneself in the film. Perhaps more so because of the focus on depravity and extremities, it is possibly even more difficult to gain attachment to it. This isn't necessarily a bad thing- it would likely detract from the entrancing experience- but it is certainly not to everyone's tastes. And repeat viewing does not come easily: with no emotional attachment, and as it implicitly answers the questions it poses there is little left to gain from frequent viewings. The fact that it is also simply a difficult watch, particularly the sexual violence and the treatment, mean many will simply not want to return to it.<br/><br/>For all that, it is deeply engaging, thought provoking, and simply fantastically well made. It is difficult to say that A Clockwork Orange is an 'enjoyable' experience, but it can be a rewarding one."

These crimes are fueled by drug infused milk called milk-plus, which gets them ready for a bit of the old ultra-violence.<br/><br/>Along his way, Alex loses the loyalty of his droogs and he gets arrested after committing a crime which is to leave him in jail for the majority of his life. He gets lucky and is signed off as a test subject for the new Ludovico technique which is supposed to make a bad man... good.<br/><br/>The technique has it's problems though, of course, but I am not going to spoil anything for those who haven't seen this yet.<br/><br/>A Clockwork Orange is a fantastically acted film, with beautiful cinematography and music.

","A Clockwork Orange is to me a cinematic masterpiece. Stanley Kubrick one of my all-time favorite directors did this film with perfection shot by shot. Malcolm McDowell delivers an unforgettable performance as the ultra-violent crook Alex. I am deeply fascinated by that in start of the film first you almost hate the main character because of his disgusting acts and at the end of the film you feel sympathy for the guy. I also really like how Kubrick used Beethoven's ninth symphony under the scenes where violence occurs. It places the viewer inside of Alex's head and shows us how beautiful violence is to Alex. I find it remarkable that 43 years after the film had its release it is still very controversial. I have read that when the film was released Stanley Kubrick received death threats and he withdrew it from theatres and almost destroyed it himself. But even with all the controversy it survived. I guess that you either love or hate this film. To me it has all the elements you could possibly wish for: a roller-coaster of feelings, provocation, excellent and powerful cinematography and memorable acting.<br/><br/>But at last Kubrick told us that we should not change a person's nature. I love it."
"willgrant952","10","1","4","12 May 2014"," A masterpiece!
","Kubrick was one of the most interesting directors of the 70's and 80's. I feel that next to The Shining, this is his best film. It's interesting how he used local places to create his 1984 style world, instead of building elaborate sets. This film sucks you in at the first frame with its synth score and awesome visuals. Everu time I watch this movie it gets better and better. I find it odd that it was banned in the UK during its original release, because though disturbing, it really isn't that graphic compared to movies like Hostel and Saw. This film stands the test of time and unlike modern cinema, it holds up rather well. Tge 70's decor looks even more futuristic today than it did when it was first released. This is just one of those films that you have to see before you die. Its an experience like no other."
"c-ellen25","9","1","4","15 April 2014"," A disturbing yet fascinatingly provocative film
","In quest to expand my film repertoire I finally mustered up the courage to sit through the whole 136 minutes of Stanley Kubrick's infamous 'A clockwork orange' and I was not disappointed albeit a little disturbed. On face value this is a film full of horrific violence but it is so much more than that. Kubrick's direction eerily portrays the stark realism of a nightmarish, dystopian future by using dim, natural lighting and hand-held camera shots to make the film feel even more real for the viewer and to mirror the dream like world that Alex lives in. Not mention that most of the violence and rape scenes are set against a classical music score which just adds to surreal uneasiness that 'ultraviolence' is the norm emphasised by the theatrical way in which these scenes are filmed which has led to criticism that the film condones violence. Hence, making the film so controversial and the reason why Kubrick himself banned the film from circulation in the United Kingdom until his death, and indeed the film can be hard to stomach but this is an absolute necessity to fully understand the dystopia and the main character, Alex. I say main character because I see Alex as neither the protagonist nor antagonist which makes this one of those rare films where you can never sympathise with the main character in anyway. However, this is also the reason that this film works as it portrays that deep, hidden dark place in all of us and shows us what would happen if it were take over us and this is perhaps the reason why Alex is seen by many as one of the greatest villains in film. On the surface, he is just like any of us but with a dark love of violence and abuse and this is further reflected in the way the future is portrayed in the film. Many cite the film as a dark satire which I believe to be true due to the fact the dystopian future heavily reflects times of the 1960s in the midst of youth rebellion and drugs, sex and rock n roll lifestyle which has taken over in that the youth rebel against elders which is true in the film and culture nowadays. It is then important to touch on the morality of choice, in the film the priest questions Alex's right as a human being to choose between the right and wrong path when the government brainwash Alex through aversion therapy to be violently ill when thinking of anything bad. The government are not interested in the individual and whether they actually understand why violence and crime is wrong, they are only interested in limiting the number of prisoners and limiting the number of people committing crime regardless of the individual thought. My take on the ending therefore, is that when Alex says he is cured no longer under the influence of the aversion therapy, he truly is cured it's just that he has made his very own choice to take the wrong path, so to speak, making Alex even more despicable than at the start. A clockwork orange is a film not without controversy and its critics but I believe it is a terrifying insight into humanity and a film that begs the viewer to really think and will reveal a new layer on each viewing. With a brilliant lead actor, this film is gruelling but an absolute must for Kubrick fans or any real film fans."
"AbhiMathews","7","1","4","13 November 2013"," Full Circle
","Often times, films depict a character and his ardour. A Clockwork Orange has a crafty lead in Alex who is as dynamic and vibrant as any. This movie is definitely creative and provides an original theme uncommon in most modern movies. It's the gait of the delinquents, diction of the characters, structure of society and underlying themes in this movie that make it such a spectacle. <br/><br/>A Clockwork Orange is sinister. From the initial acts of the four to the events of Alex's life, the entire film revolves around the theme of ""an eye for an eye."" Committing criminal acts, remorseless to the innocent and weak and pure disregard for the future is what life is like for the boys in the beginning. As time progresses, it is evident Alex is, by nature, looking for excitements and finds it in violence. A Clockwork Orange literally displays that people can only, to a certain extent, be changed at the core level. Despite advanced psychological treatments, a criminal who does not choose to change will not. <br/><br/>A reason people love this film is because of the sharp contrast it has to most contemporary movies. Rarely do you see such an adventurous yet negligent person who has wits but chooses to exploit others with it. This film is definitely worth the watch since it will leave you on the edge of your seat always awaiting for Alex's next move..."

Kubrick adapts Anthony Burgess' original novel with more visual flair than we're used to even from him, painting a ghoulish, depraved world in the not so distant future (at least, in 1971) where youth violence has run rampant. Malcolm McDowell, not one to turn down a shocking movie (like Caligula at the end of the decade), stars as the completely messed up sociopath gang leader Alex DeLarge whose various hobbies include hanging out at the local bar and taking illicit substances, classical music, raping women and just beating people for the fun of it. One night, he goes a little too far, which ends up in a trip to jail, where he volunteers for a scientific project designed to make offenders reject violence. After undergoing the experiments he is released and finds himself back on the streets, having to cope with the aftereffects of his actions when running into his old acquaintances, with not so nice results for his health, physically and mentally. The grotesque and haunting visual imagery aside, the film deals with the philosophical matter of freedom of will, as Alex is robbed of his in society's effort to keep kids like him in line, with dire consequences for the now peaceful subjects: are they really 'them' afterwards, being robbed of their choice to be violent or not? Of course most audiences ignored its thematic value and focused too much on Kubrick's portrayal of ruthless violence, which – despite his outrageous displays of 'Verfremdung' to make it easier on the soul – are still quite disturbing, ultimately leading to this film receiving X ratings around the globe and being withdrawn from UK circulation at Kubrick's insistence because it was said to inspire several violent incidents involving youths. It wasn't until Kubrick's death the film was finally allowed to be shown in British movie theaters."

","A Clockwork Orange is a dark Sci-Fi film set in the futuristic 1995 London (speculated), starring Malcolm MacDowell as the teenage delinquent Alex DeLarge.<br/><br/>Alex DeLarge (Malcolm MacDowell) is a teenage delinquent whose most frequent crimes are rape, breaking and entering, assault, and theft. He and his gang of thugs, decide to have a night of fun. This includes drinking milk laced with drugs, beating a homeless person, running people off of the road, and brutally raping a woman and making her husband watch. The next day, Alex is arrested, and sentenced to 14 years in prison. He then agrees to undertake a treatment that will make him fit to be in society. He becomes ill whenever he is confronted with sexual or violent themes. Once he is released back into society, he is not welcomed by anyone, even his former colleagues. He then unintentionally gets raveled in a plan to embarrass the government.<br/><br/>A Clockwork Orange benefits from great acting. One particular example is the scene in which the gang breaks into a house and beats the husband and wife. Stanley Kubrick thought this scene was originally ""too stiff"". Malcolm MacDowell decided to improvise, and sing ""Singin' In The Rain"" and dance while beating his victims. Overall, Malcolm MacDowell fits perfectly into the role of Alex DeLarge, a troubled soul who gets put into society without free will. All of the other actors were also great, especially Alex's charismatic gang.<br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick made this movie work with the set designs and costumes, and pulled off the feeling of the alternate dystopian 1995 London. In the film, the set pieces were dark and gloomy, but at the same time mysterious and futuristic. The costumes that are worn stand out, and truly feel like they belong in that time period.<br/><br/>When I saw this movie, I was shocked, but addicted. It is hard to explain how one can become attached to a character like Alex DeLarge, even though he is ruthless, mean, and vicious. I had to watch the movie a few times to understand that Alex DeLarge is one of the greatest movie villains of all time, because he is so charismatic and sometimes even relatable.<br/><br/>This is not a movie for children. I recommend A Clockwork Orange to fans of Stanley Kubrick, sci-fi fans, or just lovers of classic movies."

","Behold once again another wonder of our great Kubrick. A film that shows the poetic delirium of Alex DeLarge, a young boy in love with violence. Just for the sheer pleasure of its sole realization. Alex shares his story with relentless eloquence, telling his twisted tale. Alex's course in this world runs separately from the ordinary. Alex longs for and allows those emotions that he enjoys so much to rule him, and whose absence would leave him without purpose. He is a libertine who is not afraid to provide free rein to his madness, wreaking havoc on anyone who gets in his way. Some claim that ""A Clockwork Orange"" is meaningless and incoherent because this rebellion has no cause. <br/><br/>Nothing encourages Alex to do the things he does, just himself. And I believe that's the point. In a Display of Kubrick's existential style, the film exhibits a human state. Which is? Madness of course. He doesn't praise nor criticize it, he only provides an illustration. An exceptional madness,one could say, because its effectively senseless. Alex performs absurd and exaggerated violence. The ultra-violence. Just for the thrill of it. Not because society represses him or anything like that. <br/><br/>All this taking place in a world, aesthetically, psychedelic. The clothing and the environment. Not to mention the music, both give a tone of grace and irony among the midst of violent tragedy. Alex singing ""I'm singing in the rain"" while practicing the old ""in-out, in-out"" with a woman, amongst the maniac laughter of his friends, in front of her husband.The fight at the beginning of the film, two gangs massacrating each other at the sound of classical music. In this way, the brutality of these scenes is reduced. A derisive tone is predominant. The viewer does not focus on the brutality of the act itself, instead, the interest has its place in the thrill of the perpetuators. Alex also has good taste and an interesting eccentricity. He isn't just a mindless rebellious teenager, that would be typical and boring. He is a fan of Beethoven, he is a deranged poet who prefers not to conform with the imagination and fantasy that the music so profoundly provides him. He needs the action. <br/><br/>However, later in the movie there is a strike back. Alex is betrayed by his friends and goes to prison. Afterwards he is sent to a mental institution who practices experimental procedures. He is then returned to society, and she has her sweet revenge. Some would name it karma, the balance. <br/><br/>But what is the difference between Alex and society? Society transforms, it learns. Alex fantasies and delusions of violence, though reduced at some points, never stop. They are imprinted in Alex's essence and despite any attempt they will stay the same. Kubrick as always graces us with this trip, that shows the extraordinary, in an extraordinary way."

","The character of Alex, as well, is one of the earliest examples of a 'true' anti-hero. I know many people might point to the roles of James Cagney or Humphrey Bogart, or of Orson Welles' performance of Harry Lime in The Third Man. But, in truth, neither Cagney nor Bogart were actors in a modern film, and their 'anti-heroes' were really more cartoony fictions than realistic; whereas McDowell's Alex is realistic, however stylized. But more than just the appeal of the anti-hero, Alex is a bon vivant, with an incredible lust for life (pro and con), and it is that factor, added to his being an anti-hero, that makes him such a memorable character. Whether he is raping, killing, listening to music, fighting, daydreaming, he is in every moment, and then some. This is why, when he is soul cauterized by the Ludovico Treatment, there is such a strong reaction, even by people who loathe his character to that point. It is also why the ending to the film, wherein Alex is 'cured' back to his evil self is so much more satisfying than Burgess's novel's original ending, wherein Alex grows bored with his old violent life, to which he has returned, and decides to 'grow up,' settle down, and get a wife and child. Although Kubrick's decision to go with the ending of the more cynical American version of the novel (in his screenplay) caused much dismay to Burgess (it never ceases to amaze how many artists do not fundamentally even get the points of their own works), it was the correct choice for the film, and a better and more realistic artistic statement. The truth is that Burgess's novel is not nearly as potent nor powerful as some earlier dystopian works, like George Orwell's Animal Farm nor 1984, nor Aldous Huxley's Brave New World. In fact, it's not even as interesting as A.E. Van Vogt's Slan (save for the introduction of the Nadsat lingo). The reason for the film's excellence is almost entirely on Kubrick's shoulders. While people can 'reform,' with the passage of time and advent of maturity (I am a prime example), this ending would have done two things to damage the film- 1) it would have meant Alex had lost the very thing which made him 'special,' and a great character- his savage lust for life, and 2) it would have shifted the focus of the ending away from the society which soul cauterized Alex back to Alex, and this would have emasculated the film's satiric edge. A Clockwork Orange, the film, is simply not about Alex nor youth hooliganism, but fundamental and institutionalized state terror. And it's because of this change of target by Kubrick that the film still blisters its audience today; the same cannot be said of Burgess's book. Had it just been a tract on young violence, or gangsterism it would have dated as badly as many other pop cultural films from the 1960s and 1970s.<br/><br/>But, no matter how you approach it, A Clockwork Orange is a great piece of filmmaking (whereas Burgess's book is not a great work of literature- a fact that even Burgess admitted to), and the final jewel in a filmic consecutive Triple Crown that may be without equal. It deals with the most fundamental thing that our most fundamental human quality- intelligence- endows us with: free will; the ability to choose this or that, be it a minor distraction or an ethical choice of the highest order. And such travails and their contrails are best handled by the greatest of artists. Stanley Kubrick was one of them. The distance to them, however, is bridged by their works, and this film is quite the span."

","A Clockwork Orange is a film adaptation of Anthony Burgess's novel of the same name. It was written, directed and produced by Stanley Kubrick. It features disturbing, violent images, facilitating its social commentary on psychiatry, youth gangs, and other social, political, and economic subjects in a dystopian, future Britain.It features a soundtrack comprising mostly classical music selections and Moog synthesizer compositions by Wendy Carlos.<br/><br/>Alex, the main character, is a charismatic, psychopathic delinquent whose interests include classical music (especially Beethoven), rape, and what is termed ""ultra-violence"". He leads a small gang of thugs (Pete, Georgie, and Dim), whom he calls his droogs (from the Russian ""friend"", ""buddy""). The film chronicles the horrific crime spree of his gang, his capture, and attempted rehabilitation via controversial psychological conditioning. Alex narrates most of the film in Nadsat, a fractured adolescent slang comprising Slavic (especially Russian), English, and Cockney rhyming slang.<br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick dissects the nature of violence in this darkly ironic, near-future satire,complete with ""Nadsat"" slang. Classical music-loving proto-punk Alex (Malcolm McDowell) and his ""Droogs"" spend their nights getting high at the Korova Milkbar before embarking on ""a little of the old ultraviolence,"" such as terrorizing a writer, Mr. Alexander (Patrick Magee), and gang raping his wife (who later dies as a result). After Alex is jailed for bludgeoning the Cat Lady (Miriam Karlin) to death with one of her phallic sculptures, Alex submits to the Ludovico behavior modification technique to earn his freedom; he's conditioned to abhor violence through watching gory movies, and even his adored Beethoven is turned against him. Returned to the world defenseless, Alex becomes the victim of his prior victims, with Mr. Alexander using Beethoven's Ninth to inflict the greatest pain of all. When society sees what the state has done to Alex, however, the politically expedient move is made. <br/><br/>Casting a coldly pessimistic view on the then-future of the late '70s- early '80s, Kubrick and production designer John Barry created a world of high-tech cultural decay, mixing old details like bowler hats with bizarrely alienating ""new"" environments like the Milkbar. Alex's violence is horrific, yet it is an aesthetically calculated fact of his existence; his charisma makes the icily clinical Ludovico treatment seem more negatively abusive than positively therapeutic. Alex may be a sadist, but the state's autocratic control is another violent act, rather than a solution. <br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick's latest film takes the heavy realities of the 'do-your- thing' and 'law-and-order' syndromes, runs them through a cinematic centrifuge, and spews forth the commingled comic horrors of a regulated society.Disturbing and thought-provoking, A Clockwork Orange is a cold, dystopian nightmare with a very dark sense of humor."

","Poor Anthony Burgess had been clobbered over the head by personal tragedy when he was writing the novel. Still, he did manage to produce a work that was not only serious drama but was punctuated by comic elements in Alex's narration. Kubrick's movie maintains about the same ratio of serious social comment and laughs, or at least smiles.<br/><br/>Malcolm McDowell is Alex, a vicious psychopath who rapes, pillages, assaults old men, and finally murders a woman in the course of a robbery. (In the novel, he and his droogs speed down a road running over small squealing animals, but this doesn't appear in the film, presumably because it might drain us of any empathy we might feel for Alex. Killing innocent humans is one thing -- but squashing little animals?) Alex winds up in prison and is subject to ""the Ludovico treatment,"" which is a form of conditioning. He's released when he's cured of his violent impulses and fantasies. The problem is that wherever he turns he seems to run into former victims. He's driven to a suicide attempt that finally cures him of his cure.<br/><br/>The question posed is whether humans are nothing more than mechanisms whose works are determined by circumstances, or whether they are blessed (or cursed) with free will, as most religions like to believe.<br/><br/>Burgess comes down on the side of choice rather than determinism. It's an easy position to take. We're all aware of our own indecisions and anxiety, which we feel as a matter of choice. It's much more difficult to treat consciousness as an epiphenomenon -- a kind of side effect of our underground neural circuits hard at work -- which is what behavioral psychologists believe. It's hard to tell what model Kubrick endorses.<br/><br/>Kubrick's movie is funnier than the novel. In the book, most of the humor was ironic and literary. In Alex's prose, the Minister of the Interior becomes ""the minint or something."" But the film gives us additional humor because we see Alex and his droogs and victims from the outside. Patrick Magee, as one of Alex's victims, has been accused of overacting. And he DOES do the quivering madman quite well. But, if we can distance ourselves from the movie's message, his performance becomes amusing because it's outrageously overdone. And, in fact, just about all of the performances are overblown, McDowell's included.<br/><br/>It's amusing too because some incidents have been added that are, in themselves, designed explicitly for humor. Having unwittingly drunk some drugged wine with his dinner, Alex confesses to his host that, actually, he feels quite well except for a feeling that something terrible will happen at any moment. With no further prefiguring, his face plops down into the plate of spaghetti.<br/><br/>The film is identifiably Kubrick's. He's fond of flat, high-key lighting. And he uses many sets that are acoustically active, so if someone sets a wine glass down on a table top, the ""tink"" echoes. A lengthy shot is take from Alex's point of view while he lies supine in a hospital bed. At the bottom of the shot are his two feet, toes up, and an identical shot appears in ""The Shining."" I wish he hadn't decided to transform Beethoven's ninth symphony into some kind of electronic warble. What a travesty."
"classicsoncall","9","1","4","31 March 2011"," ""I want the rest of my life to be one act of goodness"".
","I thought I'd be clever and post a review of ""A Clockwork Orange"" using the language of our humble narrator Alex DeLarge (Malcolm McDowell), but I guess it didn't go over well with the folks that pass muster on this site the first time around. I have to presume that too many of my words looked like spelling errors, so I'll have to be somewhat more cautious this time and enclose them in quotes when necessary.<br/><br/>This is one of those films that hits you at a visceral level, like a good kick to the guts ('gutty wuts'), or possibly even lower, like in the 'yarbles' (you can figure it out). Actually, the language is one of the things I enjoyed most about both the Anthony Burgess novel and it's adaptation here. I grew up speaking Polish before starting school, and a lot of the words used by Alex and his pals derive from the Slavic. Take 'droogs' for example; the word 'drugy' means other, and Alex hung around a lot with his pals, the other guys. I thought Burgess' use of language was a hoot, and still get a kick out of it.<br/><br/>But you probably won't view favorably the way the picture deals with Alex's preoccupation with the old ultra-violence. Director Kubrick relies on a bit of Ludwig Van in a lot of the violent scenes, lending a surreal air to the events on screen. Fortunately, the story didn't mess with Beethoven's reputation during the 'Singin' in the Rain' scene as it punctuated each downbeat with a kick in the, you know, 'gutty wuts'. Cringe worthy scenes juxtaposed with a surreal hint of over the top excess, that's the way to enjoy your 'molloko vellocet', or glass of milk if that be your pleasure.<br/><br/>I don't think this is the kind of film one comes away with saying they enjoyed it, but it certainly gives you something to think about. Within the context of the story, Alex comes full circle, starting out as a victim of the violent modern age, succumbing to government administered experiments in mind control, and coming out cured in a way that presumably makes him more incorrigible than ever. Turning bad into good just never seems to work out the way one plans."
"ElMaruecan82","10","1","4","14 February 2011"," It's not about trivialization of violence but the exhilaration of freedom ...
","""A Clockwork Orange"" is the exhilarating journey in the twisted mind of an unrepentant(?) bastard for whom fun is synonym of ultra-violence, sex of rape, and beauty of Ludvig Van's music. This is a masterpiece of self-aware depravity highlighting our very hypocrisy towards violence. We all are pointing our fingers on Alex De Large because we don't have the decent honesty to reckon there's something absolutely magnetic in this character. I admit it, I liked Alex De Large, and I loved ""A Clockwork Orange"", the movie that told me how bad a man I could virtually become. I'm a good person as society labeled me, but inside, deep in my soul, there's a little something that commanded my brain to be fascinated by Alex De Large.<br/><br/>
Still, when I question my own gut reaction to Kubrick's masterpiece, I realize that the most instinctive answer I can give you is that the movie relaxed my very approach to violence or to whatever stink can exude from the darkest sides of my soul. Yes, I enjoyed the movie in the most vicious way. Watching Alex De Large's hypnotic grin while he was driving the Durango with his droogies, I felt like smashing to pieces this computer I'm typing on and go for an old ride of ultra-violence myself. Where? why? I don't know, nor do I feel guilty. In fact, I just feel Alex was a dangerous but no less vivid incarnation of a society deprived of morality. Some might call it dystopia but I don't think we're that far from this model where violence pleases the eyes. Look on TV, check on the Internet, ask yourself why you're fascinated by the spectacle of violence? Despite a dated futuristic setting, the movie was ahead of its time, and a milestone in its detached and decadent depiction of evil.<br/><br/>
The young hero is indeed one of the most despicable characters ever portrayed, he beats, rapes, kills with a profound disdain toward humanity compensated by a passionate love for one of its most distinguished representatives: Beethoven. Alex loves his snake as he loves himself, selfishly, carrying all the characteristics of the sociopath, he's genuinely evil and yet he's the most memorable characters of Kubrick's rich filmography. I tried to figure why, and I think after viewing this film multiples times, I came up to the following conclusion: this young hero is a villain who becomes a victim, a passive character allowing us to feel sorry for him. And that's why we forgive ourselves for loving this movie, because it turns the almighty bad to a pitiful being. Or maybe there's more to it.<br/><br/>Indeed, Kubrick's film confronts us to our own vileness by condemning vice or violence when we do find a part of them useful and fun. Another example, while we condemn deviant sex, which of us wouldn't dream of making it with two beautiful girls in the same bed, with Rossini's iconic William Tell overture score pumping his muscles? Alex's decadence is the yang of our boring yin, and if this detached violence can inspire our most sadistic impulses, curing these impulses by associating violence with nauseous sensations is another form of violence confirming the point that victims are not necessarily virtuous ... and that's the crucial subtlety, otherwise, the film would have been just a vast operatic masquerade made by a skillful director just to impress easily impressionable viewers.<br/><br/>Think: what kind of dirty mind would be fascinated by a movie where the character acts so shockingly violent, with a hypnotic music in the background and a beautiful cinematography, where is blood? Where are the broken tooth? Where are the shouts, the cries? And where's that violence that Kubrick feigns to shows but covers with dazzling aesthetics, creating a hypnotic yet dangerously appealing violence? In other words, where is the real violence? the answer is: after the iconic Ludovico treatment. In fact, it even starts with the Ludovico treatment, where Alex is confronted to horrific off-screen images of violence and becomes sick and nauseous, when he sees images of the concentration camps mixed with the music of Ludvig Van. The irony is that we never see those so called frightening images, it's all suggested, but the reaction is so believable thanks to Malcolm McDowell's amazing performance, we feel for him.<br/><br/>But again, the only violence portrayed in a non aesthetic way and rather sadistic way is when Alex De Large gets his comeuppance. When he hits someone, it look choreographed, when he kills the lady, it's off-screen, the rape scene almost looks like a perverse musical number, but when Alex gets it, he gets it. A knock in the nuts, a spit in the face, the most realistic I've ever seen, it disgustingly hits him in the lips, the beating by the bums, the drowning by his ex-friends, the whole Beethovenian torture. Alex becomes such a sympathetic character we feel the punishment disproportionate, forgetting the atrocities he's committed. Why?<br/><br/>Because it's not about the trivialization of violence, which is the most tempting and superficial conclusion, but about the exhilaration of freedom, especially, freedom of will. It's Alex' will to be a better man, to improve, but it's against his will to endure a medical torture that will deprive him from the ability to choose any of the good or the bad path. Being conditioned to follow the right path is a remedy worse than the sickness hence the stylistic difference. It's just as if violence was a pervert yet defining embodiment of our freedom from the way Kubrick magnifies it on screen which makes his accusation of desensitization wrong, the film turns violence into something ugly, but the one with the fascistic and brainwashing undertones because it destroys something even worse than the body, our freedom of will. Kubrick doesn't ""excuse"" violence but emphasizes freedom.<br/><br/>I stop now: reaching the genius of the script would be like Alex trying to grab these girl's beautiful boobs"

","Stanley Kubrick was a masterful filmmaker, and one of the few directors I feel can rightfully claim such a title. The man was responsible for some of the most influential pieces of cinema and, of all his films, this is my favorite. The tale of Alex (Malcolm McDowell), a boy obsessed with the darker side of life. He spends his evenings committing acts of rape and indulging in a bit of ultra-violence with his droogs. He's intelligent, manipulative, and completely without remorse, and his luck is about to run out. After a routine break-in ends in murder, Alex is betrayed by his droogs and left to the police. He's sentenced to fourteen years in prison but finds a means of lessening his sentence if he agrees to partake in an experimental treatment to remove his violent tendencies. The treatment works and Alex is thrown back into a society to face those he's wronged. Alex's punishments are far from over as he confronts a society in which there is no place for him, and the aggressor becomes the victim.<br/><br/>This movie would have been no where near as engaging if it weren't for Malcolm McDowell as Alex. The man is fantastic and still manages to come across as one of the most charismatic faces of evil in cinema. We watch as he engages in horrific acts of violence, and yet he manages to charm the audience into sympathizing with him through his narration. It's a wonder how McDowell didn't become one of the powerhouse actors of his generation following his incredible performance here. And, honestly, he's not alone. Every person in this film does a fantastic job in their part. My favorite supporting character would have to be Aubrey Morris as P.R. Deltoid, the corrections officer who oversees Alex. He adds some great humor to the film as he tries to warn Alex of the consequences he is facing and driving the point home with a punch to the groin. Patrick Magee is also great as Frank Alexander, one of Alex's victims who is driven to his limits after an assault on his home.<br/><br/>I find this movie interesting because, unlike most mainstream films, the main character never appears to go through any real change. Sure, he's put through the torment of the experimental procedure but in the end he's the same old Alex. Apparently this was not as writer Anthony Burgess intended when he wrote the book upon which this film was based, but I can't see the film having the same effect if Kubrick took the same route. Burgess's message is lost in the film version but Kubrick has taken Burgess's material and made it his own in a new medium. Rather than promoting how each man must make their own choice whether to be good or evil, Kubrick seems to revel in basking in the corruption of this future society where the government is no better than the criminals. Many people have commented how they hate this film for it's exploitative violence and, yes, there is reason for some to be repulsed by it's content. Some will just find themselves confused at the nadset language developed by Burgess for this fictional world (not me, though...I loved it. I wish it were real) I'm certainly not one of this film's haters and I rank it as one of my top favorites."
"JamesHitchcock","10","1","4","22 December 2010"," Evil is the price we pay for the freedom to be good
","To celebrate my 900th review for IMDb, I turn to another of my favourite films. ""A Clockwork Orange"", based on Anthony Burgess's novel, is set in a dystopian London of the near-future. The main character is Alex, the teenage leader of a gang of juvenile delinquents, and a young man whose main pleasures in life are rape, ultra-violence and classical music, especially Beethoven. Alex is arrested and jailed after a woman is killed in the course of a robbery carried out by the gang. In jail he volunteers to take part in an experimental programme called the Ludovico technique, which effectively involves brainwashing him so that he will feel horror and nausea at the very thought of committing violent or criminal acts. <br/><br/>The film was produced, directed, and written by that most original of cinematic auteurs, Stanley Kubrick, who finds a very original way of dealing with his subject-matter. Although it deals with social problems such as crime, violence and youth gangs it is not made in the social-realist style which had been a hallmark of the British cinema about a decade earlier. It is about as far from social realism as one can get; it is a nightmare vision of the future rather than a realistic vision of the present. <br/><br/>The plastic-looking futuristic sets, the lurid colour scheme and the deliberately non-naturalistic acting are all intended to create an atmosphere of unreality, as is Wendy Carlos's musical score. Beethoven's music, especially the Ninth Symphony, plays an important part in the film, but for the most part we hear the ""Ninth"" in a strange, distorted arrangement for synthesiser. When Alex and his friends, or ""droogs"", have a brawl with a rival gang, this is choreographed, stylised, almost balletic screen violence. The gang wear bizarre costumes (white overalls, bowler hats, codpieces and masks) and speak an equally bizarre slang known as ""Nadsat"". The distinguishing feature of this private language is the many words borrowed from Russian, either in their original form (""Bog"" for ""God"", ""droog"" for ""friend"") or in an anglicised corruption. (""Horrorshow"" from Russian ""khorosho"" for ""good"", or ""Gulliver"" from ""golova"" for ""head""). Exactly why English slang should have been colonised by Russian in this way is never explained; if Britain has fallen under Soviet control this is never made explicit in the film. <br/><br/>Burgess gave a number of explanations for his title, one of which is that the word ""orange"" is a pun on the Malay ""orang"" meaning ""man"" or ""person"". (He had served as a colonial official in Malaya and spoke the language fluently). Alex, after he has been transformed by the Ludovico technique, is a ""clockwork man"", one who appears human but who is in fact an automaton whose actions and emotions are pre-programmed by others. This gives a clue as to Burgess's intentions in writing his satire. <br/><br/>On the one hand he was concerned that psychiatric manipulation could become a powerful tool in the hands of a totalitarian state, or even a nominally democratic one. The Britain seen here is an increasingly authoritarian society where a populist government is using strong-arm methods to fight crime, not only by brainwashing criminals but also by recruiting thugs into the police force; two of Alex's former droogs later reappear as police officers. The government's opponents, however, are also shown as self-seeking, anxious to exploit Alex's predicament for political gain. The harsh, authoritarian nature of this future Britain is emphasised by the use of uncompromisingly Brutalist modern architecture such as the Thamesmead Housing Estate as a backdrop to many scenes. <br/><br/>On the other hand the Roman Catholic Burgess was also concerned to explore the nature of good and evil and the question of free will. The brainwashed Alex is incapable of committing evil acts, which means that he is also incapable of goodness. These views are articulated in the film by the prison chaplain who points out that goodness must arise from a free moral choice, not from compulsion, and that those who are free to choose good are also free to choose evil. Evil, therefore, is the necessary price we must pay for the freedom to be good. <br/><br/>The choice of Malcolm McDowell as Alex was an apt one, as he is excellent at suggesting both the good and evil sides of Alex's character. In the violent scenes he plays the character with a sort of satanic glee, but at other times he is also able to suggest a surprising innocence, like a demonic choirboy. <br/><br/>The film was immensely controversial when it appeared in 1971, largely because of its graphic depictions of violence, and there were predictable calls for it to be banned. Had it come out in 1962, when Burgess wrote his novel, it doubtless would have been, but the prevailing moral climate had become increasingly permissive in the intervening nine years and the censors were no longer prepared automatically to ban films at the behest of the puritanical. On this occasion, however, the puritans had an unlikely ally in the shape of the director himself, who withdrew it from distribution in Britain, for reasons that have never been clear, and the ban was strictly enforced until Kubrick's death in 1999. For many years this was virtually a ""lost masterpiece"" in the land where it was made, much talked-about but never seen. <br/><br/>Since 1999, however, the film has been freely available, and we are once again able to appreciate its brilliance as a darkly satirical vision of British society which seems just as relevant today as it did nearly forty years ago and a masterly exploration of theological and philosophical issues. Kubrick made a number of great films, but it is ""A Clockwork Orange"", together perhaps with ""Dr Strangelove"", which remains his most personal. 10/10"

","Since first discovering A Clockwork Orange in the early 80's as a teen there has been no film that captures my attention as much as this one does. I go back to it every year or so and still see things I missed the time before. The recent Bluray release was a slice of heaven. To be able to see it in such detail was amazing, from the first blink of Alex's eye to the last. The imagery is like no other film I can think of except maybe 2001. Kubrick is my favorite director without a doubt and this is his masterpiece. The acting and characters are all so memorable and scene after scene is just incredible. My only issue is a bit of a slow down in the second act but not nearly enough of a determent to give it anything less then ten stars. I believe there are two types of people when it comes to ACO, you either get it or you don't. Righty right?"
"antonjsw1","10","1","4","31 May 2010"," Crime and Punishment
","This is a very disturbing, but utterly brilliant film.<br/><br/>It very cleverly deals with the themes of morality and the use of psychology as a medical treatment, and its use for good or ill.<br/><br/>Kubrick works in a very clever analysis of liberalism v conservatism in terms of crime and punishment, and comes to the conclusion that neither approach on its own is the answer.<br/><br/>The film is very stylised, and clearly has evolved from Kubrick's approach for 2001. However, the view of the future is certainly more dystopian and political. The future United Kingdom is socialist/police state, with a 3rd world type gap between affluent and poor. The film focuses on a group of teenage tear aways and the impact of a specific crime on one of the characters, Alex, played by Malcolm MacDowell in a tour de force performance that has you absolutely spellbound throughout the film. His performance is totally charismatic, and he is put through considerable physical challenges in this film, including an eye injury that almost blinded him. Unfortunately, while he gave some good performances later on (Time After Time, Star Trek Generations)he never reached the quality of performance he did in this film again.<br/><br/>The film operates in three acts, Alex's life before incarceration, his time in prison and subsequent treatment, and the impact of that treatment on his release from is sentence. The story brilliantly plays on the role reversal aspect, as Alex's victims become persecutors, and Alex himself becomes a victim. It shows society's hypocrisy and tendency for the rule of the mob in terms of punishment of a criminal. It also offers up the notion that you cannot remove criminal behaviour from someone artificially without consequences, some of which are clearly unintended. Its doesn't judge, simply offers up an observation of how politics serves the purposes of politicians, rather than the people the politicians represent. This theme couldn't be more timeless, especially with scandals that have beset the real life British political system in the last year, and an emerging tendency, particularly in the last 5 years, of politicians seeming to want power for power's sake, and being willing to do anything to maintain it, including U turns on policies.<br/><br/>The rest of the performances are good, including a very curious and eccentric interpretation by Patrick Magee as the injured writer Frank Alexander, a strong performance by Michael Bates as the chief prison officer, and a clever performance by Anthony Sharp and the ruthless but charming politician.<br/><br/>Technical credits are excellent.John Alcott's cinematography is excellent, with Kubrick's signature use of wide angle lenses, clever use of zooms, and excellent and imaginative hand held camera-work. Kubrick also makes brilliant use of both slow motion and high speed to drive the narrative in effective and amusing ways in specific parts of the film. Bill Butler's editing and John Barry's production design are highly effective and the actions sequences are brilliantly put together, including some excellent stunt work.<br/><br/>Finally the electronic score, interspersed with classical 'Ludvig Van' as the protagonist puts it, is fresh and works brilliantly with the film, with some scenes clearly edited to the music, rather than the other way around. However this does not detract from the film.<br/><br/>In summary a tough, dark, disturbing and amusing masterpiece that has you thinking long after the film is over"

","The one thing I do not like about A Clockwork Orange is how it reminds me how desensitized I am to violence. I should be horrified by what happens on the screen, I should turn away in disgust, but I do not. So, by principle, I will not allow this film to be called ""boring."" Do not misinterpret me; I legitimately enjoyed this movie. It is visually and audibly thrilling. Its surreality gives it a unique element rather than a weird flavor that leaves the viewer feeling confused and unsatisfied. Stanley Kubrick is a master at emotionally manipulating the viewer, and Malcolm McDowell knows how to bring Alex DeLarge to life on the screen and in the audience's world. Expect the unexpected with this film; I thought, for instance, that there would be know plot (which there was) and I thought the violence would be unbearable (which, with spiritual misfortune, is not), and I thought that I would hate Alex for what he does (I feel the opposite). Perhaps it is easier to understand if the viewer knows what was going on in England at the time the film was made (a near state of anarchy). Perhaps it is just one of those films that has to be seen. Do not read the reviews or the synopses or articles; just watch it, and see what happens. There is little else that can be effectively done with A Clockwork Orange."

","Kubrick has been renowned for movies that have been viewed as highly controversial, the most notorious being A Clockwork Orange (1971) and Lolita (1962). What makes the movie appear so controversial to watch is how the worst crimes committed by Alex and his gang or 'drogues' as he calls them are conveyed. For example, while Alex and his masked companions break and entry into a couples home, the cripple the husband by kicking him in the Dr Martens boots(a fashion icon from this time)while then moving on to cutting the wife's jumpsuit off with scissors while Alex happily sings 'I'm Singing in the Rain'. He then rapes her of which we o not see. As well as this, the movies most energetic fight scene is done in an almost elegant style, via the use of classical music, of which is used for Alex's love of Beethoven.<br/><br/>A Clockwork Orange vividly captures violence, rape, and sex in an almost disturbing way yet you still remain glued to the screen, it was groundbreaking because of the taboos broken and how far you can go in term so what is simply suitable to be shown in cinema.<br/><br/>An absolute masterpiece."

I should had a clue watching Kubric's previous film, 2001, with the ""Blue Danube Waltz"", but this is better. Plus you get the whole idea of what is a ""free man"". As the prison ""charlie"" says, the man has no choice after his brainwashing.

","I had been curious about this film because it had attained so much critical acclaim and because I wanted to see if it matched up to its reputation.<br/><br/>I was instantly captivated by the witty writing of this movie. The dialogue throughout the story is extremely riveting as it utilized chiaroscuro to mix the light and frivolous with the dark and twisted. <br/><br/>Alex's character is certainly an ambiguous figure as one has a hard time not liking him by the end of the movie despite his obscurely twisted motives. He conveyed a nightmare of a youth whose intentions were anything but moral. Without any sense of righteousness, Alex epitomizes the horrors of savage youth. He is every parent's worst nightmare, yet he manages to intrigue every sense in viewing of this film. <br/><br/>This was an extremely powerful movie. I will have to watch it at least two more times before I grasp all the minute details that contribute to the message. See this movie you and I guarantee that you will not be disappointed."

Aversion therapy may work to do both, but is that really a solution? Why waste the fortnight? Just give them a frontal lobotomy and be done with it.<br/><br/>The American solution is just the opposite. No less right-wing, the largest prison system in the World serves two purposes: legalized slavery and disenfranchisement of minorities.

"omar10796","10","1","4","16 June 2008"," Creepily Brilliant.....
","A Clockwork Orange, considered by many as late director Stanley Kubrick's most controversial film (more so than Lolita), is a film that was made during the hype of the acid frenzy: it has that feeling of discord and hallucination; like a world imagined by the worst person you can think of. And yet, it amazes you, enthralls you, and other verbs meaning it's a pretty good movie. My personal favorite scene was after the first few scenes, after the night's shenanigans, when he is alone in his room. He sits, puts on some Beethoven, and goes into his own world of ultra-violence; that speaks volumes about Alex, our protagonist, or is it antagonist? It's hard to even tell anymore; What I can say about this film is that it envisions a world where the government can change a man to meet their fancies; maybe writer Anthony Burgess was predicting the future of humanity; a world where our personalities can be altered to meet someone's fancies. Questions like these have been asked for ages, and this film may or may not give an answer, but it comes pretty damn close<br/><br/>Now, onto the film itself: very well made, really recreates the novella on the big screen, though some things are added in and some are changed (Gene Kelly, I salute you), but it stays true to the main theme of the movie: you can't change someone; you can't cure them of their faults."
"Trythewine","10","1","4","11 June 2008"," Pure genius, timeless and not for everyone
","It's hard for me to read the negative comments about Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange,"" but then I have to sit back and realize this movie is not for everyone. So here is a quick checklist for those considering viewing the film.<br/><br/>1. If you go to church every Sunday...this movie is not for you. <br/><br/>2. If your favorite movie came out in the last 15 years...this movie is definitely not for you. <br/><br/>3. If you dislike classical music...It's not for you. <br/><br/>4. If you dislike like violence...you better stick to PG-13 because this movie is absolutely, positively not for you! <br/><br/>Unfortunately, it appears that many who dislike the film cannot get past the ultra-violence and brief nudity, which are central to the plot. <br/><br/>Alex, a youth living in a nondescript future London, is pure evil. He is deceitful, manipulative, he robs, rapes, kills and brutalizes without any remorse. In this future society the government is concerned with staving off the climbing crime rate and rehabilitating the youth of the day. After a murder conviction leave's Alex in the stir, we truly see how conniving and unrepentant he is. Once released from prison, a government experiment leaves Alex defenseless against violence from those he has wronged, but it is still difficult not to root for him. <br/><br/>I think people are who are truly disturbed by this film realize, but would never admit, how they would like to be like Alex in a small way and take part in some or all of his exploits. I wonder if they would say the same about ""Lolita,"" equally disturbing, but on a different level. Those who love it feel the same, which is why they watch it over and over. <br/><br/>Yet another masterpiece by Kubrick, in my humble opinion."

But after i was done watching, it didn't have that much of an impact on me, i thought it was OK, i did not get the message at the time, butthe next week, i watched it again, and i got it, i got the message, i understood the genius! the next day i watched it again, and after that day i became in love with this movie! Stanley Kubrick's best! he takes this movie by the reigns and steers it into the perfect movie. the images in this movie, while not as epic as 2001 a space odyssey, our still certainly incredible! the scene of Alex and his droogs will stay with you for ever! speaking of Alex, Malcom Mcdowell is incredible, he steals the show, the dialog that he speaks is odd and captivating.<br/><br/>the music is mesmerizing, its hypnotic, classical music playing opposite such ""ultra-violence"" is not the type of music one would first think of for this type of movie. As for the violence, it is not that violent now, in fact it isn't, back then people were over exaggerating! they had grind house movie worse than this all the time! the real main problem is the rape scenes. There is a lot of it, and i can see why people would find it disturbing, but to me, the way they are shot, makes them just one of the things to love about this movie.<br/><br/>Most directors give you all the answers, so that you can understand the whole movie the first time you see it. Not kubrick. The first time you see this movie, you are tooo distracted by the weirdness of this film to tkae anything out.

"BroadswordCallinDannyBoy","10","1","4","19 April 2008"," The Products of Violence
","The products of violence are not always easily identified. They seem to be easily identified when people point out the obvious, but that is hardly ever the whole story.<br/><br/>At first Alec is a very unlikeable character. A low-level punk who manages to commit atrocious acts of violence with his band of ""droogs"" and even keeps them in line with an iron fist. On top of that he doesn't go to school and chronically lies about his activities and whereabouts. Thus, it can be said that all he does is obstruct people within his own society. The finger of blame seems to be pointing at the one and only problem at this point - the problem is Alec and without him society would be better off. After one night of vandalism and mayhem, that inadvertently ends with a woman's murder, Alec is betrayed by his own gang and left for the arriving police.<br/><br/>The cure for Alec's recklessness seems to be on its way as he is sent to prison. At this point it is where many stories of this type end - the anti-hero recognizes what he did and now he realizes that he must pay for it. Kubrick takes his story further by introducing a new type of program meant to rehabilitate criminals. Alec volunteers with the hope that it'll work and he'll be not only out of prison, but assured that he will never go back in. Yet it is during and after this experience that Alec is given at least the same amount of abuse that he unleashed earlier onto people. Being rendered in capable of aggression Alec is left as a hapless victim for a society bent on violence as a way of solving its problems. Even his ""treatment session"" involves duress.<br/><br/>It is the film's ultimate irony that the violence that Alec unleashed earlier is what has seemed to prevented him from harm until he is no longer able to unleash it.<br/><br/>The film is quite long, but this is not a film to watch once and plainly understand. Kubrick was a master of subtlety and upon repeated viewings new things can still be discovered about his films and his complex themes better understood. --- 10/10<br/><br/>Rated R for violent content including rape. Ages 16+"

","""A Clockwork Orange"" is one of the strangest but most intriguing films I can think of. It's an altogether bizarre experience and quite ""out-there"", but the work displayed here is just flat out excellent. The film centers on Alex de Large (Malcolm McDowell), a delinquent in future Britain who feeds off of sex and violence. But when he is arrested and put through a mind-changing experiment by the government, things don't all go as planned.<br/><br/>What most would consider Kubrick's best film, ""A Clockwork Orange"" is one of those movies you need to watch more than once to fully enjoy. The first viewing is the strangest because it takes awhile for the viewer to fall into the alternate reality and become accustomed to it. But once you let yourself into it, it becomes a much more interesting movie. It's a mind trip for sure, and a flawless one at that. Sometimes it's downright funny, and others it's extremely disturbing - the emotions in the movie range all across the spectrum.<br/><br/>The dialogue and script is all pitch-perfect, the acting is stunning especially from McDowell, and the atmosphere and imagery is to die for. The set pieces and overall feel of the movie is unique, with a sort of retro '70s-gone-wild architecture. The score is amazing, mostly consisting of good old ""Ludwig Van"" and mainly classical music, but the score plays along with the movie perfectly. Kubrick's camera-work is great and his overall style is unmatched - I saw many similarities between this and his later horror classic ""The Shining"" while I was watching this. His style and overall tone is unique, and his vision completely original - it's not hard to see why he became one of the most beloved filmmakers of all time.<br/><br/>Overall, ""A Clockwork Orange"" is a film unlike any other. It offers a disturbing look into a fictional character's life, and everything that it revolves around is completely enthralling. Beautiful cinematography and camera-work, perfect performances, unique imagery and atmosphere, and a painfully bizarre story make this one of the all-time film classics. It's a film that is hard to describe - you sort of just have to see it for yourself, and more likely than not, you will appreciate it and enjoy it as countless others have. 10/10."

","Stanley Kubrick has done some really great and classic films like Dr. Strangelove, 2001: A Space Odyssey , The Shining and A Clockwork Orange is definitely one of them. The film has an appeal to it that makes it such a classic film since it has violence, rape, comedy, satire, irony, drama and a main character that is so interesting you can't help but love the film. The acting is great especially from Malcolm McDowell who does a great job as the main character Alex. The film is narrated by Alex has he tells his story of what happened to him with his gang and what happened after, Alex (Malcolm McDowell) is a young man who is the leader of a gang he calls Droogs that like ultra violence and rape, Alex also likes listening to Beethoven music. They also like spending time at a Milk Bar when they're not doing any ultra violence or rape, the Milk contains drugs which makes them ready for more. Alex also shows his Droogs who's boss and after a discuss of a new idea Alex beats the two up but afterwards he lets them tell him there new idea to rob someone, they go to the cat lady's house and Alex sneaks in and after accidentally killing her with an ornament he unlocks the door and just as the police are arriving they whack him over the face with a milk bottle and leave him for the police.<br/><br/>Alex is sent to prison and after a while in there he hears about a new treatment being used that stops people from going to prison again, the warden allows him to leave so Alex is then transferred there where he soon is taught that violence and rape is bad by watching videos of certain things and the medicine makes him feel bad when these things happen, Alex can no longer hurt anyone or rape anyone because if he does he will feel a terrible feeling. Alex can only do good after only doing evil, he's a Clockwork orange.<br/><br/>A Clockwork Orange is a great classic by Stanley Kubrick that should be seen. Check this out. 10/10"
"ajag180","10","1","4","13 March 2006"," For me It's the best homage to Beethoven and Mozart
","Oh, i think that ""a orange clockwork"" remember us the pain of our ancients instincts. Many people say that the ultra-violence represented is the worse form to express our essence. We are a violence specie, we love to communicate, we are afraid of dark and solitude. I consider that the relation or harmony between music, the performance and the dialog is perfect. It also represents the human without any obstacle to action, without any moral code, without any influence of the society, perhaps also without conscience. Alexander is Mozart. We, the homo-sapience are staring, no without desperate a form to be a real different animal. So we must watch the movie with scorn."
"Sylviastel","10","1","4","19 January 2006"," What Kubrick does best?
","I have only seen this film once and yet I probably will watch it again. It's kind of painful to watch sometimes especially those scenes in the prison. Malcolm McDowell should be knighted by now. His role of Alex, the criminal, becomes a three dimensional character rather than just a caricature. Of course, the late great Stanley Kubrick provides spectacular images and scenes with color and unforgettable music. The movie shows a futuristic society in which the criminal like Alex can be cured but mostly by some of the most inhumane motives. I don't approve of Alex's crimes but I don't think cruel punishment is the way to redeem and cure the hard criminal. Because once he goes on the outside, he reunites with some of his victims. They return the crime. So crime begets crime, victim becomes criminal and the reformed criminal like Alex becomes a victim of society. This film ponders the questions about curing criminals. By making him a victim of crime, he becomes the victim. The sad truth is that it does not work. Criminals like Alex need psychotherapy, drugs, and something more than watching Nazi films about abuse. BUt I'll definitely watch this film again. With Kubrick, you can never get enough, boy do I miss him."

","A Clockwork Orange (1971) was a product of it's times. The late sixties and the early seventies was a violent era. Movies were becoming ultra violent in nature. World affairs were brutal and the media was showing it all. So when you mix a brutal novel about a nihilistic society with modern times you get this. Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange. Based upon the U.S. released edition of the novel.<br/><br/>Malcolm McDowell (in a career making performance) stars as Alex, a gang leader who lives a violent filled life with two parents that he treats like imbeciles. But we can tell he's getting tired of his gang and when they try to push around for more leg room, it get's nasty. But one day Alex's nice way of life is gone in an instant. Will Alex be able to cope with his new lifestyle? How will he react when reality hits him?Can he be cured of his criminal behavior? You'll have to find out for yourself when you watch Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange.<br/><br/>A nasty and brutal film. It's still a tough watch, even today it's packs a mean punch. The movie riled all the critics back in the day. But it's a well made film and another notch in the master's belt.<br/><br/>Highly recommended."

","I really do wonder what all the fuss about with Clockwork Orange. O.k it does have a bit of violence and a little bit of nudity and maybe it was a bit strong for 1971 but not enough for it do get the notoriety it has. The biggest controversy about this for me is that it got that much publicity and perhaps Kubric deserves the praise for hyping a less than brilliant film up banning it. As for the movie itself , it is weird and does look good as do all Kubriks films but i certainly wont bother watching it again. i'm not sure if it trying make a political statement but if was it was lost on me. The first half an hour is apalling and i almost considered turning it off which i hardly ever do but as the film went on it got better or should i say a little less sureal .

","I have to admit the concept of a criminal being reformed and then being attacked by his own victims is a great idea. But the movie which I was expecting to be incredibly intense, was actually soft. In the rape scenes I didn't feel sad I just waited for it to end. Kubrick could have milked the crippled mans loss but the whole scene was too fast, I mean Alex plays psychological games with his ""brothers"" but when it comes to the rape it's just a thing that he feels like doing. It seemed more like fun than lust And some ""ultra violence"" that turned out to be, it was nothing.  I could understand why he would want to attack his victims, but the old man was the only one that worked. And the government was made to look too ridiculous, at least do it with subtlety, might as well have painted I'm stupid on all their heads.<br/><br/>In short, the idea is pure beauty but it could have been done better."

"Tweekums","9","1","5","3 April 2014"," Stylised ultra-violence in a near future dystopia
","Protagonist Alex DeLarge leads a small gang of thugs; his droogs. Together they like nothing more than an evening of ultra-violence and rape, being somewhat more cultured Alex also loves the music of Ludwig Van (Beethoven); especially his Ninth Symphony. When his droogs get above themselves he quickly and violently puts them in their place or so he thinks. Later on after a particularly brutal attack they knock him out and leave him for the police. He is sentenced to fourteen years in prison but after two years hears of a revolutionary treatment that will cure him of his antisocial tendencies and enable him to be released quickly. The treatment, a form of aversion therapy works perfectly; he feels violently sick whenever confronted by violence or sexual urges as well as accidentally robbing him of the ability to enjoy his beloved Ninth Symphony. Once out he tries to get on with his life but those he once wronged aren't so forgiving.<br/><br/>Like most films from director Stanley Kubrick this is worth watching although it isn't for the fainthearted; the violence may be highly stylised but it is still brutal and disturbing. The first half of the film introduce us to the world of Alex and his Droogs; a world of casual violence where they take what they want without concern for others. One might think that this would mean his 'treatment' would be less disturbing but seeing him with his eyes held open as he is forced to watch violent and sexual films is just as gruelling. Malcolm McDowell is the obvious star of the film; his Alex is scarcely off screen and also provides the film's narration; he does a great job in the role. This narration is important to setting the tone of the film; the 'Nadsat' slang he uses giving it an otherworldly feel we may understand what he is saying but many of the words are unfamiliar. The choice of music also adds to the menace; synth versions of classical music and most memorably Alex singing 'Singin' in the Rain' when raping a woman. I don't think this is Kubrick's best work, much of it is deliberately hard to enjoy, but it is still a classic with the power to disturb over forty years after its release."

","I was 16 or 17 and going to boarding school in Pennsylvania. I had to take the train into Philadelphia by myself in order to testify about some theft that happened at my school (someone stole my stereo!). I had some free time and I sneaked into a theater for the first afternoon showing of this film. There had been some publicity in Time Magazine with racy pictures, so I had heard about the film. I was amazed that I was able to get in because it was rated X and I had never seen an x-rated film before. I was shaking with guilt and anticipation. There was practically no one else in the theater.<br/><br/>As soon as the first note of the soundtrack started and the orange titles began to appear rhythmically with the music I was riveted. I couldn't believe how musical this film was and how the music and images worked as one. Images I had never, ever imagined popped onto the screen. The make-up on Alex, the costumes with the cod pieces, the naked milk figures. Suddenly a naked woman appeared. I had never seen a naked woman in a moving picture before, only in Playboy and Penthouse magazine! Then all of the violence. And all of it choreographed so perfectly to the music. It was a completely foreign world...but so incredibly stimulating! My heart was pumping with absolute joy. I had never seen anything so exciting in my life. The dancing Jesus, the snake and the vagina, the bouncing penis sculpture, the Beethoven statue smashing a face, the scissor stripping of the woman, Singin in the Rain...I was absolutely intoxicated.<br/><br/>By the end of the film my life had been changed. This was the first entertainment that I had ever seen that stimulated all of my sense and moved me to the core. For years after I replayed the movie over and over in my head (this is before VCR's) using a book with the script and black and white pictures from the film and the soundtrack LP.<br/><br/>Now, over forty years later, I still like the film very much but it is not in my top ten. It really tapped into my adolescent mindset back in the 70's, but as I grew older and focused more on the story and message it was not as interesting. However, to me this film was pioneering, particularly when it comes to music videos which it anticipated and which developed many years later.<br/><br/>My first love in life now is classical music. Only music can move me the way Clockwork Orange did when I was a teen. The music in Clockwork Orange helped give it it's power over me and sent me on a lifelong journey into the world of classical music. Kubrick was brilliant when it came to using classical music...but in a way it is cheating. Without classical music, 2001, Clockwork Orange and Barry Lyndon would not be as great as they are. So I thank Kubrick, Beethoven, Purcell, Rossini, Elgar and Wendy Carlos for A Clockwork Orange."
"andy-933-696608","9","1","5","1 November 2013"," It all boils down to the nature of choice within our morals, and the irony of being an object within that debate.
","To understand the human being, one has to understand the idea of freewill. Although it is difficult to determine whether or not free will exists, it much simpler to analyze on how genuine a person can be, based on their own nature. Stanley Kubrick's dystopia satire plays on this concept of human individuality, pitting itself against a more mechanistic conception of the human being. A Clockwork Orange explores the subjects of morality, political institutions through manipulation, and the initial use of behavioral psychology, in a story that plays out with a chaotic theme of destruction, mixed with comedy.<br/><br/>The young, and difficult to detest Alex (McDowell), our loving narrator, is both charming and witty in his many loves of life. Be it the beauty of battle among ""Droogs"" of a lesser caliber"", his appetite for the ""old in out"", or the awe he experiences every time he plays Beethoven's the ninth. Alex, along with his fellow droogs walk the streets of London, beating the poor and further concocting more mayhem to enact on the innocent. After killing a gymnast, with an erotic piece of art, Alex is sentenced to 14 years in prison. It doesn't take long for the young hoodlum to acquire even more enemies, be it the conservative prison Chaplin(Quigley) played with an amusing authoritarianism that further strengthen the satirical aspects of the film.<br/><br/>After two years, of faithfully reading the good book, Alex enlists in a government rehabilitation program with the potential to help him get out quickly. Little to his satisfaction comes the revelation as he faces and reviles at the very violence he once cherished worthy of the grace of God. One grotesque image after another is played out with the ninth in the background, thus deconstructing the very monster Alex is, no by the means of himself, for the concept of choice is forsaken for simply greater ethics. It's hard to imagine that there are those who believe that the outcome is more important than the means generated, but as the Minister of the Interior (Sharp) proclaims his change of heart as the cure to evil, Alex's true purpose through the film becomes ever more clear.<br/><br/>When first viewing this film, and its brutal rape scenes, accompanied by a jolly tone of wonder, the delusion that Alex merely serves as the role of a sociopath came to mind. As the film progressed however, the manipulation of his nature for political gains, became one of the clearer messages within Alex's Cockney rhyming slang. The London society of the film although not completely desolate, is defined by chaos. The streets are filled with rampant gangs of violent sadists, crooked cops, and erotic artwork. Several of the criticism's towards the society in the film, have labeled it a Communist State, just after its failure to stand within the image of socialism. It isn't a far cry of an assumption, as equality appears to be absent within the setting, and it is much easier to see who is in charge. Regardless of who gets to Alex, be it the right-wing Minister, with his intellectual generosity, or the self-righteous patriotism of the Anti-Totalitarian left, his place is that of a puppet. Regardless of his nature, or whatever bad luck he stumbles upon. Alex will always find someone to play the puppeteer of his life.], never full grasping the irony of his place in the very society that has robbed him of his right to choose.<br/><br/>Although very brash in its approach towards the subject of political manipulation, behavioral psychology, and sexual violence, A Clock Work Orange is bold, and liberating exercise in filmmaking. Written and Directed by Stanley Kubrick, the film Adaptation of Anthony Burgess' novella is brilliant in its approach of presenting morality within the scope of choice in opposition of psychological abuse. Although the protagonist, Alex is a genuine monster, one cannot completely hate him. Within the first fifteen minutes, he rapes a woman, while singing ""Singing in the Rain"", and yet it is through his rather calm and quaint narrations that he is able to charm his audience into further observing his story, wondering where his path of inner torture will lead him. Malcom McDowell, in one of his first screen roles, delivers a performance that is both malevolent and ecstatic in its execution. As the leader of his droogs, his pacing along with his patience, comes the essence of a wacky and capricious trickster, who sooner tastes the perils of victim hood. Initially we are meant to sympathize with him as he is further thrown down a pit of despair. This same pit carries the many atrocities that he once more acquires, as he utters ""Yes I was cured"", but it all boils down to the true significance of his own purpose as a tool for political power, and not any genuine significance or meaning in his existence other than an addict."

","I have heard a lot about this movie before i've decided to rent it a few days earlier. I heard about how violent it is and how controversy it caused on it's initial release and its ban (I learned about in my mass media class about violence in the media)even spawning a syndrome in which gangs of young men impersonate the main characters taking journeys of rape and the so-called ""ultra-violence"". After finally renting it and watching it i finally saw what this film really is: Extremely violent, disturbing and sick but ultimately a genius masterpiece and one of the finest works of cinema ever made. In futuristic Britain, young Alex and his gang enjoy going out at nights and hitting raping and cursing everything in their way, but when Alex is caught by the police for murdering (by accident) one of his victims he is sentenced to 14 years of prison, but when ALex hears about a new method that might help him get out of jail quick, which is an experiment that will eventually make him feel sick every time he gets into a situation that might trigger his violent and sexual desires. Alex agrees but while this method helps get out of jail and diminish his violent desires, it also takes away his humanity from him and his ability to make his own choices which leads society to take advantage of him and unleash its violence on him and Begin went through the experiment, he is left helpless against it. Everything about this film, from the script to the direction to the performances to the soundtrack (relying heavily on Beethoven's 9th symphony), and of course the violent and sexual footage that might disturb to a level that some will find too much, all add up to this films ultimate message: How much can the authorities take over the individual's ability to make his/her own decisions and strip him away from humanity no matter who he or she is. Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece lives on and will continue to earn new fans every year, if u haven't seen this film before and have the ability to watch it, do yourself a favor and watch it, fro it is one of the greatest, most thought-provoking films ever made"
"sirable1","Null","1","5","29 July 2013"," One of the great, most artistic films in the history of cinema.
","In the history of film, there are only a few moments of pure cinematic genius; moments that ultimately transcend film itself, creating something wholly different but altogether brilliant. Bergman did it with a simple chess game that became a metaphor for life and now Kubrick created a parable defining man's evolution, and now with A Clockwork Orange, he has done it by crafting a brilliant story chronicling the age old nature hunts, tortures, and kills a bunch of men conflict.<br/><br/>You don't simply see A Clockwork Orange, you experience it in the same way you would a colonoscopy. It literally feels as if a camera has been inserted inside you to help you better understand you. These aren't simply characters. Each persona that appears on screen has been carefully crafted with the same gentle touch that guided Camus' hand when detailing the hopes and dreams of men content with their place in the world. I felt this characterization in the very core of my being. Better yet, Mr. Alexander, a representation of man at his pinnacle as he chases that illusive brass ring. These aren't simply characters; they're living, breathing people, if living, breathing people only existed in one tiny man's brilliant fantasy.<br/><br/>And then there's the tiny, brilliant man himself, Kubrick, an able hand that surpasses his peers, even Hitchcock himself, when it comes to mis- en-scene. Hitchcock borevthe word subtlety into your skull, expecting his audience to match him on an intellectual level. Kubrick has no such pretensions. He intrinsically knows what you want and tells you exactly how you should feel, a refreshing concept that I've come to expect after 10 years spent living under the glorious intellectual utopia of the Bush years.<br/><br/>Few films will ever touch this as this will. It stands now as one of the towering achievements but all together as a human creative expression."
"jack_haworth","10","1","5","6 July 2013"," A captivating and often shocking social commentary - one of the best films of all time
","To sum A Clockwork Orange up with mere words is to deem it in some way comprehensible, an action that seems utterly absurd when considering its content. From the almost nonchalant approach it takes to taboo subjects such as rape, to the astonishingly bleak and alienating setting in which the events take place, the film breaks nearly every social barrier with Kubrick's trademark unflinching nerve, rendering conventional analysis somewhat futile.<br/><br/>Alex DeLarge, the titular 'Clockwork Orange' is an unruly youth living in a dystopian vision of Britain somewhere in the future who spends his free time listening to Beethoven, drinking drug-laced variants of milk and parading the streets with his gang practising 'ultra-voilence'. His animalistic, sociopathic lifestyle is short-lived; he is soon imprisoned for his psychotic crimes. However, barely two years into his fourteen- year sentence, Alex is given an unlikely lifeline when he is offered freedom for taking part in aversion therapy known as the 'Ludovico Technique'.<br/><br/>A social rebuking, the film initially tackles the issues in youth culture, questioning – through extreme exaggeration – the attitudes towards adolescent violence and the lack of justice in society (one of the opening shots involves a tramp howling: ""It's a stinking world because there's no law and order anymore! It's a stinking world because it lets the young get on to the old, like you done""). Especially today, in the age of the ASBO, these analyses seem eerily resonant. However the focus shifts therein, as it subsequently becomes a study on psychological amendment, exploring whether the act of 'change' can be inflicted upon one by a third-party, or must be a natural decision made by oneself. The priest at the prison, possibly the only relatable character in the entire film, acts as a medium for Kubrick to channel this message: ""Goodness comes from within. Goodness is chosen. When a man cannot choose, he ceases to be a man.""<br/><br/>Though it strictly follows the work it is based on - Anthony Burgess' novel of the same name (although it doesn't show Alex's final redemption as in the book due to all US editions omitting the final chapter, including Kubrick's copy) it still has the iconic director's personal stamp all over it, from its claustrophobic tone and lengthy scenes to its comic yet risqué and deeply experimental nature. The imagery, though beautifully surreal, is done with surprising minimalism; the set design is not overtly stylised - derelict apartment blocks and bizarrely wallpapered rooms are not overwrought or clichéd. Instead, Kubrick creates his dystopian nightmare by taking familiar suburban settings and stripping them bare, revealing their ugly foundations.<br/><br/>The score, powered by a Moog synthesiser, is unreservedly chilling, serving to invigorate the more disturbing scenes further with equally challenging audio – the famous opening shot of Alex's twisted grin as he sips a glass of milk surrounded by his boiler suit-clad cronies and an unusual number of female mannequins is only enhanced by the music, which offers the same stinging supremacy as the glare of our anti-hero. With every lingering scene, each standing out as a separate work of art in its own right, A Clockwork Orange thrives on its creativity and originality - it is written with enough wry wit to coax a bitter chuckle even from those who find it difficult to stomach and at times painful to watch: ""No time for the old in-out, love, I've just come to read the meter"". It crafts unusual and bizarre characters such as Alex's youth worker, P.R. Deltoid, and breeds its own off-kilter humour in the incredulous language (Nadsat, a toss-up of English, Slavic and Cockney rhyming slang). To argue that it obeys the conventions of other pitch- black surrealist comic sci-fi crime dramas would be ridiculous, simply because there are no others like it: it is the first and only of its kind. The only other work that draws any comparison at all is Nineteen Eighty-Four, but no adaptation of George Orwell's classic has even scratched the surface of the ground that Clockwork covers.<br/><br/>What A Clockwork Orange wants us to know is that conditioning a violent person to be physically unable to commit acts of violence does not make them a pacifist. Torturing a rapist until they gag at the sight of a pair of breasts does not make them reformed. Morals cannot be programmed, morality is learned and obeyed. Between them, Burgess and Kubrick have forged a frighteningly austere alternate world and an utterly terrifying central character who, in his transition from perpetrator to victim, is the puppet of the plot's central message. Some it captivates, some it disgusts, but whether it evokes sorrow or bewilderment, exhilaration or revulsion, it is irrefutable that A Clockwork Orange is an impossible film to shake - an unforgettable work of art which has truly earned its place in cinema's hall of fame."
"tdaddict99","10","1","5","13 February 2009"," Fantastic Movie
","~CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!!!!~ A Clockwork Orange, directed by Stanley Kubrick, is one of those movies that stays with you long after you have seen it. The first time viewing, I thought it was a pretty good movie, but not one of the greats. But after repeated viewings of it, it definitely grew on me and I now know why people give it such good reviews all the time.<br/><br/>The movie is basically a take on the inner workings of people. the way we think, the way we act and why we do these things. We all have our good sides and our bad sides. We make mistakes, that's a part of being a human.<br/><br/>The movie revolves around the character of Alex DeLarge, a teenager (at the beginning), who, with his droogs (friends), goes on the wrong side of the law. He takes drugs (the milk at the beginning of the movie), he steals, he bashes up old people, rapes women and eventually murders a woman while trying to attempt a robbery, which eventually goes wrong because the police arrive and his droogs betray him because they are sick of his actions. Alex is taken by the police and that is where the story really starts to pick up.<br/><br/>While in Prison, Alex starts to read more and more of the Bible. Alex is eventually chosen to take part in a new rehabilitation project which will change criminals and make them lose the ability to do evil acts. This is shown when Alex is released from Prison and is unable to act violent towards anyone, nor is he able to perform sexual acts upon women (such as raping them).<br/><br/>When Alex is released, he tries to go back home, but finds out that his room is being taken up by a lodger and his family basically do not want him anymore, so he leaves and meets up with the old man that he once bashed up with his former droogs. The old man gets his friends and they all surround Alex where upon two of Alex's former droogs appear and then Alex goes through hell. They punish him by sticking him in a trough full of dirty water. Alex stumbles upon a house where he once came to (with his former droogs) and raped a woman and injured the womans husband. The husband is still there and he punishes Alex, where upon Alex tries to commit suicide by jumping out of a window, and fails. He is taken to the hospital and he is changed back into what he used to be because people thought that it was wrong to have had him changed in the first place.<br/><br/>The story revolves largely around Alex and explores the evil sides of human nature. It's a very engaging movie and it will grow on you, like it grown me. This is definitely a recommended movie."

","20 minutes ago, i watched one of the strangest if not the strangest movie that i ever saw in my life!...and let me tell you that i have mixed feelings. I certainly think that this movie is a classic flick, that was very provocative in the 70's ( the best movie era in a history of the motion picture ) but at times it made me a little bit bored, but that is because this is the type of movie that you should watch at least 3-5 times before you get your mind correct-after all, the godfather part II is certainly the best movie EVER for me, and after i watched it for the first time, i said to myself that this movie can't come close to the original, but after few seeings later, it become obvious that this is the only movie who will get a perfect score in my book.<br/><br/>But let's go back to A Clockwork Orange. It is satiric and sadomasochistic. Malcolm Mcdowell is just brilliant and he should get at least an Oscar nomination if not the main prize. SPOILERS: The movie has a simple plot, Alex ( Malcolm M. ) and his 3 friends robe, fight, rape and also kill the rich and odd people. In one particular moment Alex is arrested by the police and then they put him in jail for 14 years. He only serves 2 years, because he is willing to do the test that will erase from his mind the violence...but here is the sick part -the good is not always good-!!!...It only makes his life more hard and at the end he tries to kill himself, but he fails. And he becomes once again the old menacing Alex! The movie has phenomenal score, especially at the start of the movie with menacing look at the camera by Alex! Brilliant acting and also directing by one of the best directors of all time!<br/><br/>P.S. get a subtitles, even if you are English spoken person!<br/><br/>Very recommended movie."

","I stumbled across this movie and i heard so much on how a masterpiece it was, so i bough it for around 4$ along The Shining as well, wich i still have to watch. I was going totally blind, no nostalgia googles from me as its not a film i watched as a kid or anything. First viewing in 2019, almost 50 years after it was made and i am 33 years old.<br/><br/>To be honest, i kinda like some part of it, i think the message it tell is strong, and i apreciated the ""tour de force"" that the movie still manage to make us ""care"" for a guy that did horrible things. I enjoyed the general story of it.<br/><br/>That being said, oh my gosh this movie is long... There is so much part i felt i could had trim that wouldn't had impact the story. There is a bunch of scene where we have to watch every single little things one after the other. Maybe i am too used of modern cinema where those are shortened but still... There is also a bunch of things that kinda pull me out a bit of the movie, the way some characters talk and felt like caricature almost. Also some stuff that didn't made much sense even for the 70s.<br/><br/>I dunno, maybe its because i watched the movie while it was almost 50 years old, maybe its just not my type of movie in the first place. But in the end i did take a look at how much time there was remaining around 4-5 times, but yet i didn't disliked the movie nor was i totally bored either, so thats why i am gonna slice right in the middle and give it 5/10. Of course it was surely different watching this in the 70s or even the 80s, so i would say my review is only valid for viewers of my age or younger that will watch the movie for the first time in modern times."

"SquigglyCrunch","4","1","6","12 August 2017"," A Well Directed, Tasteless Snorefest
","A Clockwork Orange follows a young man involved in a brutal gang who is used for an experiment that tries to cure his criminality. <br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick is one of the biggest things to appreciate about this movie. His directing is quite good. Despite everything else in the film, his work behind the camera was something I couldn't ignore. <br/><br/>In addition, Malcolm McDowell as Alex, the protagonist, is quite good. His performance only gets better as the movie progresses, making the last act all the better. <br/><br/>Speaking of the last act, it's pretty great. The direction it decides to go is fascinating, with all the stuff the main character goes through as a result of his past life, and it really says something on society as a whole, all the while not being too horribly blatant about it's message. <br/><br/>As far as the rest of the movie, it's okay. The first two acts are painfully boring, and even aspects of the third are too. I found little purpose in the tasteless display that the first chunk of A Clockwork Orange was. It was like the movie was trying to be both brutally edgy and artsy at the same time, but it forgot to be tasteful about it. So much of the movie is over the top for no real reason other than to be over the top. I read a little on the movie where it tries to draw a parallel between the movie's content and the experiments that Alex is subjected to, the parallel being the audience's inability to look away, but I found myself looking away from the screen far more than I have in a long time. I had no problem looking away and paying minimal attention to the film while I looked at my phone or watched the paint dry on my walls. The first two thirds are incredibly simple and frankly, rather uninteresting. It was unnecessarily drawn out and as a result I felt myself dozing more than once. The movie started out actually making me feel physically sick, which I thought was a good thing because that meant that I was semi-invested already (it was able to make me feel something genuine early on), but then it divulged into a boringly unoriginal story that I simply couldn't care less about. <br/><br/>Some aspects of the third act prove to be rather absurd as well. I know that I said earlier that most of it works really well and isn't overly blatant, but there's one scene in the movie that really doesn't make a lot of sense. It didn't need to be in the movie really. It involves two characters from the first act, and it felt kind of unnecessary. Like it didn't need to involve those two characters, it could've (and should've) been literally anyone else. <br/><br/>And the music is, while mostly good, overused to death. Most every track started to feel like a frustratingly obvious cop-out, where instead of showing actual characters and story we just got montages and narration to said tracks. And that music was all the same. It was like Kubrick could only get access to two or three tracks and recycled those over and over. <br/><br/>Overall A Clockwork Orange isn't my cup of tea. While the leading performance, directing, and final act are solid, the first two acts, use of music, and pacing were all lackluster. I've read reviews where people say 'you have to see the movie more than once to fully appreciate it' but I'm sorry that I can't stand the idea of sitting through this movie more than once. The artsy stuff all feels artsy for the sake of being artsy, and that's it. I'm not curious about what everything else means, it doesn't seem like there is any meaning to begin with. So in the end I personally wouldn't recommend this movie."

"StevePulaski","10","1","6","18 September 2013"," Mean-spirited for the sake of a message
","A Clockwork Orange isn't an atypical classic because nearly everything you can say about it has already been said. Praising it has become a pretty traditional thing to do, and if you dare criticize it, then you must endure not just the cult-fanbase but the Kubrick-fanbase. I wouldn't wish backlash from both of those groups on an enemy.<br/><br/>Howeer, I shouldn't be hearing it from either. Stanley Kubrick's controversial classic is a troubling but required watch, adapted from Anthony Burgess's novel, which is rumored to be inspired from a personal instance. Burgess's wife was brutally assaulted by a group of thugs at one point, and Burgess tried to penetrate the psychology of such unconscionable men who would dare commit such a disgusting, degrading act. If this is true - and Kubrick left Burgess's message from the novel in tact - then the stance he takes here is stunningly humanistic and brave.<br/><br/>The film stars a young, energetic Malcolm McDowell as Alex, a young man who commits unsightly atrocities such as rape and assault upon getting innocent people to open their doors thinking they're doing a helpless soul a favor who they believe was in a car-wreck. He commits these crimes with a gang of men he calls his ""droogs,"" and their spree resorts to an ugly but surprisingly professional scene of rape. During this scene, Alex sings a familiar song you will not see in the same light again (similar to how Alex will later react to a specific song, but I'm getting ahead of myself).<br/><br/>Alex is eventually arrested and thrown into prison, but he's given an option upon entering the compound. He can be simply jailed or he can be psychologically conditioned - a new process that can help him - to be good and moral. He chooses to be conditioned and undergoes a series of mentally trying tests that take his individuality, regardless of how despicable it is, along with the basic qualities of him being a human with free-will. After the lengthy psychological processes are complete, he's released back into society as a changed man.<br/><br/>Though it predated techno-music pioneer Gary Numan's career by a few years, A Clockwork Orange seems like a cinematic adaptation of one of Numan's darkest, eeriest songs. From the stunningly cold voice of Alex, to the futuristic, dystopian environment, to the beautifully polished set-designs, it seems as if this is a Gary Numan song with the benefit of being a one-hundred and thirty-eight minute music video. All I was waiting for in the end was the Machman to show up.<br/><br/>Moreover, the content of this film is widely known to be explicit and still somewhat shocking to this date. But make no mistake in saying the film is mean-spirited just to be mean-spirited. The film's commentary on psychological conditioning taking away human individuality and free will and devaluing ones worth to making him a conforming citizen in a world with diminishing uniqueness is strong and potent. A Clockwork Orange isn't an exploitation film and it isn't a film with violence for violence's sake. The film goes to great lengths to detail psychology and conditioning to the point where it wouldn't be a stretch to name it one of the field's biggest films.<br/><br/>The film is also another case where the lead actor and director team up to make an incredible match. Malcolm McDowell gives a tremendous performance here that's troubling, alive, and coldly inspiring. McDowell is only elevated by Stanley Kubrick's typically wide-angle shots and very spacious long shots that show the landscape of the shots and the futuristic design of Kubrick's vision. These talents combined give A Clockwork Orange the strong performance and directorial leverage it needs to communicate its story and message significantly.<br/><br/>Finally, it must be said that A Clockwork Orange was going to be a challenge to adapt to the screen no matter assumed what position. The novel is more heavy on the slang than the film, and featured a large glossary in the back of the book defining every word clearly. The film doesn't have that privilege and likely several others that are exclusive to the novel. As all book-to-movie adaptations, the film provides the benefits of a specific (not an absolute, as many confuse) vision of the novel's work and, as a result, may offer the best adaptation one will ever see of the novel.<br/><br/>Starring: Malcolm McDowell. Directed by: Stanley Kubrick."

","Normally, I would rate any memorable movie, even if I did not like it, or certain parts or acting, a 6 or 7 at least.<br/><br/>The reason I rate this so low is for the gratuitous violence. Mad Magazine did a dead-on satire of this movie two decades ago. The violence is repulsive and over the top. It's putrid. The rape scene, and the constant batteries and assaults are too much.<br/><br/>Most unusual is some of the dialog between the gang members, which uses a made-up slang.<br/><br/>That being said, I loved the acting and the score. The plot is basically relevant to modern times.

The message comes across at the second minute. The ending was what everyone expected. The idea is great and I can appreciate how brave he was for making a movie like this but it is a weak movie. The acring is good but sometimes weird like they just actes they were not one with the character. 
Why this movie gets so much attention is understandable. Stanley Kubrick is a Legend but not
all of his movies are great or even good. The reason I didn't stop was because of the ultra-violence it's like when you see something horrible in the news. You are disgusted but you keep on watching because you want to know what happened and how it ended.<br/><br/>Big disapointment. It's not bad if you compare it to transformers but you will be bored more often in this movie than in the first transformers.<br/><br/>5/10"

","Good film. Was very weird, although i watched it when i was drunk but even then i thought it was brilliant and so clever! It's a pretty old film which made me immediately respond with 'ergh' as it's not usually something that attracts to female sixteen year old under the influence of alcohol but I was pleasantly surprised by the mind and skill in this film which requires the audience to watch closely (preferably not whilst drinking). Some scenes in this were disturbing and sexual which made many of us laugh but it did not effect our reaction at the end of the film. Mainly 'what the hell was that' but overall 'wow that was brilliant. I would watch this again and recommend it to anyone."

","This film is the result of the era in which it was filmed. Today, I doubt it could be filmed. In any case, as bad Cinematic Art goes this movie is as bad as it gets. We begin with a terrible script, taken from a lousy novel, and add some of the worst acting this side of The Brady Bunch. The only reason it's popular is because of the blatant exploitation of rape and other sexual violence. So I imagine that says a great deal about our society. To top things off, the movie is about 30 minutes longer than it should have been, because there came a point where it was obvious that the story ended, but the director decided to continue filming anyway. Why is the only question?"

We have spent our whole lives only to satisfy the society's positioning and to be a so-called good people.
Sex and violence are two aspects of human's natural desires. If we can restrain our reaction to naked desires in front of us, that is, the key to distinguishing us from primitives to moderns, perhaps it seems more civilized in this lack of barbarism In society, we live more repressive, only that he has been carefully hidden in all kinds of hypocritical social systems!
When the perpetrator and the victim exchanged, the perpetrators who became ""good people"" dropped their weapons, but the knife was picked up by the victim, removed the hypocritical mask, and stabbed the perpetrator without hesitation. What about social threats?<br/><br/>It's the opposite of things. The lowest desire is mixed with Beethoven's symphony. The most elegant music has now become endless torture. Just like Alex, he also loves Beethoven. The most beautiful ""Music in the Rain"" has become the best way to express violence in his mouth. It is really ironic. Kubrick may be the most special director. He said that mixing elegance with the bottom makes the whole film full of a magical atmosphere.
Even the most rebellious Alex succumbs to political lies, which is really ironic.
When a fresh and juicy orange is fitted with a mechanical clockwork, his vitality has completely disappeared, but it runs monotonously like a walking dead every night. We may just say this is nothing in this huge social machine. Special little pinion!"

","This is certainly not a very comfortable movie to watch, with plenty scenes of extreme violence and rape. However, this movie does not glorify or endorse violence, it uses those scenes to tell a story with a greater, deeper and more powerful message.<br/><br/>The background music in the more violent scenes has a great comical effect and add a relief effect because, at least in my case, it reminded me that it was just a movie, which lighted a little bit this sometimes horrifying experience.<br/><br/>Besides, I find the movie highly thought-provoking because it make us think about human behaviour and how certain government policies can be even more inhumane than random acts of violence made by mentally ill or disturbed people."

","From the beginning, it was extremely impactful, with a lot of naked sexual organs and violent scenes. The four guys who wanted nowhere to vent had robbed, raped, madness and restlessness to form a collection of four evils. The film is so unordered, chaotic streets, and sky-rocketing rooftops. The human-made evil is described undisguisedly. The audience seems to have fallen into the dark and treacherous abyss of hell, facing the death of blue-faced fangs. The most evil of the four is the protagonist. His beautiful face, elegant taste and actual action form a strong contrast. Goodness and beauty become the masks torn off, and the true face of the fierce and evil shows fangs.<br/><br/>I feel mixed with good and evil. After the male host was successfully treated and released from prison, the victim who had been violently treated became the perpetrator. The male host could not resist, he became a thing that could not be violent or sexually intercourse. (Based on the partial absence of human beings, and called things) The basic desire is suppressed, and the once evil collection becomes the collection of the forced lack of evil, and the good is not reflected in the film. So it caused me to think: What kind of person is a person? The violence that we fear and sometimes hurt us is indeed a part of people, and even a very important part.<br/><br/>In a sense, social operation can be called regular operation. There are strict procedures in the prison, and every action is nothing, and the rules become a huge pillar and a chain of operation.<br/><br/>The political issues discussed in the film are obvious and need not be repeated. I am more concerned about the state of the male owner. He has always been like duckweed, riding with the wind. I think evil is an essential impulse that is difficult to discipline. Good is an acquired constraint is the so-called moral ethics. A very old proposition is whether humans are good or evil at the beginning. I have no answer. The fact is that I didn't blame the male host or even sympathize with him. Compared with the fullness of viciousness, it's more pessimistic for me not to be a person."

","If you've seen most of Kubrick's films, you'll understand the emphasis on diagramming - actors, objects, and the spaces in between. It's a strong reason to want to watch a film. Especially if it's a film as messy, sadistic, and verbally vague like A Clockwork Orange. Based on Anthony Burgess's book, the film started off as being a dystopian horror but soon transformed itself into a glorified drama.<br/><br/>The film's motive is simple. It is to present to you the life of people without the immediate effects of law and order. And by those virtues, it portrays distasteful and offensive acts that the world (perhaps inevitably?) would carry forward. The story is about Alex, a hedonistic, sadistic, and young man, who spends his nights listening to Beethoven's 9th, and his days frolicking. He's violent, a rapist, and a sex addict. If you're wondering if there's any hidden philosophical purpose to the story, there isn't. But that's not to say there isn't a psychological one.<br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick composed the film's frames imagining how one would a contradictory and conflicted world. He dehumanized Alex to the point of insanity. It's focused - it's not clear why Alex is but his existence is seen and purported as an object. The scene where they're all walking in a tight circle in prison externalizes this aspect. It compresses their crime as striking not a moral nerve but only a bureaucratic one. One that serves a society; someone we raise to the stand to desensitize and terrorize the masses.<br/><br/>The film has no telling, instrumental moment. It's harsh and radical. That some things never change. That's the moral of the story. Only Stanley Kubrick presents it in a way that it is bound to confuse you. With the help of religion and psychiatry, the film is long and psychopathic. You're not supposed to feel something for Alex - even though it's his life you plunge into all throughout the film. And for me, that's a tough thing to achieve. To present a character for the length of 140 minutes and not give away any emotion to the audience (that is you) to take home or sit with."

The film doesn't reveal a lot, but gives clues to what it's really like and it's great figuring it all out. The movie also has some nice witty lines.
The main character was iconic, and the doctors and the other members of the gang were also nicely developed. Although the rest of the gang didn't have much dialogue, a lot of their personality was expertly revealed through the characters actors. Not really a dull scene, although some of the scenes when he was at home were a little dull.<br/><br/>There were many scenes in the movie that could've been very emotional, but due to lack of character development with some of them, the execution of the scenes was a bit off. The scene where the main character is forced to listen to the music he hated was a bit emotional.

","I've seen this film three times over the years. The first time I saw it, I was completely blown away by how awful it was. Surely I was missing something, right? I mean, after all, it's considered to be not only one of the best films of the 1970's (no slouching decade) but of all time! I asked a friend of mine who was studying film in California what I was missing, and his answer was, ""Well, it's a Kubrick film, so you may have to watch it more than once."" And so, that following year, I sat down and watched this film two more times waiting for the reveal to finally wash over me. Today, I can tell you that was easily the worst piece of advice I've taken so far in my life. This film makes absolutely no sense whatsoever, and any ""underlying themes"" people speak of is a load of hogwash. It's just bad. Period.<br/><br/>So, why did this film become so popular over the years? Probably because people LOVE to bow down to Kubrick as being the greatest filmmaker of all time, and nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, the only movie I've seen from him that's actually good is Full Metal Jacket.<br/><br/>Although I've never read the book, I'm sure it's much better than this film. People were a lot less likely to bandwagon books pre-Harry Potter. If a book got a lot of attention back then, it probably deserved it. My recommendation would be to read the book and not waste your time on this pretentious, illogical, downright frustrating film."

It indeed comes from the director, with possibly the strongest back-catalog of movies and tackling a multitude of genres (across the board). The clothing, style and attitude was five million miles away from 2001 but it's intrinsically related, far more than you think. The genius of Stanley.K, has been celebrated by many (and through out the decades) and for me most evident with this real, violent and most beautiful horror show. 'A Clockwork Orange' pulls no punches and shocks the audience into a strange but stark reality. Kubrick got the very best performances from his selected actors and Malcom MacDowell, was arguably tops. Another smart move (by the director) was to let this charismatic young star, improvise in character. The most memorable scene is Alex, bursting into the song 'I'm Singing in the Rain', which he states, he made up on the spot. A little dated now perhaps but a 10 all day long."

I read the book first and really liked it and where it was going.(would rate it 10/10) So, I was already quite sure about the fact that I would definitely like this movie. With this big name, Stanley Kubrick, on the front cover and the movie itself being under the best rated movies of all time it was pretty clear for me that this movie would do its thing good. Well well well, it was not all what I thought it would be like. Kubrick somehow achieved to f*ck this great book completely up. To make it short: The novel ""A Clockwork Orange"" is written by Anthony Burgess and has a very huge point: it is a plea for free will, for freedom and has many, many great ideas. The movie by the ""genius"" Kubrick fails to portray any of the criticism in the book. It is just a mash up of female nudity, phallus symbols and dialogue, taken from the novel, that is completely misused and reversed. All characters here, except for Alex, are stereotypes and only the main actor does good work, portraying ""Kubrick's version of Alex"". The setting doesn't feel right for the story at any time and is just (as the characters) some modern art installations of the 70's one after the other with no deeper sense or contribution to a higher thing. THIS is what a pretending piece of filmmaking is. The ""ultra-violence"" and how it is portrayed is also laughable. In the movie, the shocking acts of violence from the original story are presented pretty harmless as if Alex and his droogs and no single f*cking other person ever had the intention of hurting anyone really bad. The main actor does a good job, the soundtrack is gripping and fitting and it is interesting to watch these meaningless art installations(3 stars), but every other thing is done wrong in this movie. Can't recommend this movie. Read the book instead or at least before watching the movie."

","Are there any science fiction/futuristic films that don't have a cynical or dire viewpoint on the world and society as a whole? A Clockwork Orange is a cerebral look into a group of young males venture into ultraviolence and mass crime against the innocent. It's known for its deep themes and moralistic questions that it proposes. Oh, and it's pretty dark and haunting.<br/><br/>Although 30 years apart, A Clockwork Orange reminds me a lot of Requiem for a Dream. Both films explore a group of troubled young adults who get their hands far too deep into something dangerous. For Requiem it was drugs, Clockwork it was violence. Both films also do a nice job at miraculously making criminals likable, or at least people who you can have sympathy for. Most of all, both films are thought provoking pieces of art, but something that I never want to re-watch.<br/><br/>Clockwork particularly follows Alex DeLarge, a delinquent who takes a lot of joy out of committing crime. But his heinous crimes of rape and murder finally catch up to him and he's sent to jail, where an offer to rehabilitate and set him free catches his eye (pun intended). Before I get into the meat of what this film deals with, it's worth talking about Stanley Kubrick for a second. He's directed some of the most famous, and usually divisive, films of the 20th century. All visually stunning, thought provoking, and graphic in detail. A Clockwork Orange is all of those things, but there's no particular moment that I want to revisit, and perhaps that was Kubrick's intent. Perhaps, he wanted the audience to always feel uneasy and on the edge of their seat. Perhaps, Kubrick wanted us to go through a similar treatment to what Alex underwent. The Ludovico technique.<br/><br/>Kubrick has a knack for producing imagery that will never leave your mind. Just as I'll never look at hotel rooms the same after The Shining, or A.I. after 2001, I don't think I'll ever be able to erase the image of Alex brutally raping and murdering a woman while singing 'Singin' in the Rain'. Shocking, disturbing, you name it. That was an extremely powerful scene. That pretty much goes for the whole film as well. Malcom McDowell provides an engrossing and charismatic turn as Alex. I'm sure it's incredibly difficult to make this character someone who you actually root against and then subsequently root for, but he does it. And that's not even mentioning the difficult physicality of this role.<br/><br/>Overall, A Clockwork Orange is a film filled with deep and dark themes that will stick with you long after you see them. Great performances and great directing from Kubrick power the film through what should be purely exploitative, into something influential. <br/><br/>+McDowell's impressive performance physically and emotionally<br/><br/>+Thought provoking<br/><br/>+Haunting imagery<br/><br/>-Difficult to imagine myself ever revisiting it<br/><br/>8.0/10"

","Stanley Kubrick has proved himself a highly influential filmmaker in the face of Hollywood, and when it comes to hitting major topics to the silver screen, he does not mess around. Blessing Hollywood with a long series of cinematic gems until his death in the late 90s, Kubrick has succeeded above the surface level when covering big topics such as politics, war, crime, and science-fiction (2001: A Space Odyssey). This early 70s dystopian thriller A Clockwork Orange made an enthralling commentary on violence and juvenile delinquency. The film garnered a fair amount of controversy for its graphic portrayal of violence and sexual mistreatment, initially landing it an X rating. Before too long, gained a major cult status to where it was named one of Stanley Kubrick's best work by many. Set in futuristic Britain, the film follows Alex DeLarge (played by Malcolm Dowell), a sadistic teenager with a love for violence, sex, and classic music by Ludwing Van Beethoven. He is the leader of a sociopathic gang of his friends Dim (played by Warren Clark), Georgie (played by James Marcus), and Pete (played by Michael Tarn) who commit series of vicious crimes around town including beatings and sexual assault. Upon killing a cat lady, his friends abandon him on the scene leading to the authorities to catch him and throw him in prison. During his prison sentence, Alex grows ashamed by his petty ways and volunteers to undergo a psychological treatment that will not only render him ""good"" but also reduce his prison sentence. Upon being released, Alex tries adjusting to his new life, only to witness his violent past becoming back haunt him. <br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick's unique flair shines clear in this dystopian thriller, from the astounding cinematography, to the dazzling production design, to the magnetic storytelling based on the acclaimed novel by Anthony Burgesa. This movie shows Kubrick at one of his best, if not on the level of '2001: A Space Odyssey'. There is also no doubt however, that this is darkest picture yet, supplementing violent and lurid material that's destined to make even the most desensitized viewers uncomfortable. The film opens with the main character Alex filling the screen with an unsettling smirk to give viewers to clear implication of his dark nature. Associated with this scene is a loud, lurid music score by Walter Carlos to deliver a disorienting feel of what audience should be prepared for. Following the opening scene is the first fourteen minutes of Alex and his gang unleashing their unspeakable on innocent victims. There is a beating, a rape, and the infamous ""Singing In The Rain"" sequence. Instead of portraying the characters as outright evil however, Kubrick illustrates the characters as teenagers with a very dark sense of humor who know their petty crimes are harmful but simply must be done because a society without crime not normal, according to them. Though these scenes aren't pretty to watch, they are gifted by a decent cinematography by John Alcott who's a Stanley Kubrick veteran since his first collaboration in '2001'.<br/><br/>Over the decades, Alex DeLarge has grown to be a highly memorable figure and this all thanks to not only Stanley Kubrick's captivating script but Malcolm Dowell's genuine performance. Dowell shows off a grueling and highly realistic vibe as the main character, the fact that Dowell walked away with no even an Oscar nomination remains quite a mystery. If his dark portrayal doesn't give chills down your spines, I don't know what will. Arguably the strongest aspect of the picture though, comes from the plot development. Tackling on themes of juvenile delinquency and crime against society, the plot endures stringent commentary on the impacts of violence. By no means, it does little to hold back. From beginning to end, the film journeys through the main character's sadism and follows through the consequences that he endures when he attempts to rehabilitate himself from his sadistic demeanor. To that point, the film grants some twists and surprises to channel an unpredictable (and deeply disturbing) tale. The film could have taken a more happy route by chroniclizing Alex readjusting to his home life and teaching his fellow others his new, wholesome ways, but then it would result in a plot much less meaningful and no surprises.<br/><br/>A Clockwork Orange is a ultra-violent, but riveting Stanley Kubrick picture that serves a definition of the filmmaker that makes Kubrick the smart, influential director he turned out to be. As being one of his most acclaimed films, this movie is worth watching for film buffs but the dark, violent, and disturbing content that pervades the picture is enough to warrant only a single viewing and likely discourage viewers from enduring a second viewing. This film is recommended but not for the faint of heart or anyone under the age of seventeen."
"Leofwine_draca","8","0","2","26 February 2016"," Daring and provocative
","This classic controversial film from Stanley Kubrick is a love-it-or-hate-it movie which tends to divide audiences like the rest of the director's filmography. It's certainly a unique movie, perfectly made up to Kubrick's impeccable standards and with important messages for us all. Take for example the core ""corrupt oppressive society"" vibe that runs from 1984 to BRAZIL and you have the basis for A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, which tells of mind control being used on thugs and irredeemably evil prisoners. As well as this, Kubrick's movie looks at violence and its effects on both the purveyors and victims and proves to be a rewarding character study of an angry young man, as played by Malcolm McDowell (CALIGULA) in what can be called one of the defining performances of his career.<br/><br/>Classical music has never been put to such good use as this in a film (aside from, perhaps, Kubrick's own 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY) and it fully complements the on screen action. Brutal street battles are played out in slow-motion as soothing tunes blast out on the soundtrack and the result is an effective depiction of the beauty of violence, if it can be called as such. Scenes showing Alex and his droogs going about their daily business of raping innocent women and beating innocent men are thoroughly horrific and very violent for the time, although of course the impact has been dulled by what has come since. However, the best parts of the film come during Alex's therapy, as he is forced to watch violent film after violent film in a dark cinema and gradually becomes sickened to the sight of violence and, indeed, sex. The aftermath keeps you guessing as to the eventual outcome, making for some very tense scenes when Alex finds himself in the home of a man he had previously crippled.<br/><br/>The acting is of a high calibre, with many strong supporting performances to complement Malcolm McDowell's own shining example. Of particular note are Warren Clarke and the others playing Alex's scarily sadistic droogs; Patrick Magee (DEMENTIA 13) who has a field day as the mentally unstable victim; Adrienne Corri as a rape victim of the gang and the actors playing the various doctors and scientists. Sharp eyes may spot future Darth Vader Dave Prowse playing Magee's strongman bodyguard. My only complaint with the movie is that it has now become inevitably dated. The use of obscure language for the most simple of terms just seems a bit pretentious and unnecessary and defeats the air of realism the movie is trying to put across. However, seen with a fresh eye, A CLOCKWORK ORANGE is daring and intelligent cinema and a well-made film to boot, not exactly entertaining but certainly though-provoking and challenging."

","""A Clockwork Orannge"" is a Stanley Kubrick movie from 45 years ago. It runs for 2 hours and 15 minutes and fits in nicely with its time as it was quite a psychedelic experience to watch. The film was nominated for 4 Academy Awards (3 nominations for Kubrick himself) without winning one. Lead actor Malcolm McDowell played his role very well, but ""only"" managed to get in at the Globes. The film is all over the place in terms of action and contents, but it is actually cleanly structured from a filmmaker's perspective. Pretty much exactly the first 45 minutes, so one third of the film, is an extended prologue. We find out about the main character's criminal activities, plus his interactions with his parents and a couple other supporting characters.<br/><br/>In my opinion, this first third is also the best part of the entire film. Yes it is still very shocking during everything that follows later on, if not more shocking even, but I personally felt in terms of dramatic impact the film left on me, the first 45 minutes are when this film really shines. If you decide to watch the movie, make sure you are not easily offended as there are some pretty graphic sequences in terms of torture, some of them with McDowell's character as the offender, others with him as the victim. A whole lot of the film is about his (forced) positive (?) character transformation, but I cannot say that I enjoyed this part as much as I wanted to, even if there are some interesting parallels occasionally to our world. This one is set in the future obviously and plays in dystopian Britain. A very different kind of science fiction of course compared to all these space-set role model films from that genre.<br/><br/>All in all, I enjoyed the movie and McDowell's performance, even if I must admit I felt it got a bit less interesting the longer it went. Kubrick probably could have cut 20-30 minutes and it would have been an even better film if he had chosen only scenes from the second half of these 135 minutes. Nonetheless, it's an interesting watch for its absurdity and the Orwellian setting of this entire thing. Recommended."

","""A Clockwork Orange"" will always stay in my all time favorites list of movies. I must have seen this movie about ten times and never got bored of it.

The story of Alex DeLarge and his droogies, terrorizing the neighborhood with their ultra violence and raping. I can see why some people don't like it because some scenes are hard to watch, certainly in 1971. Now violence is more trivialized and people aren't that easily shocked anymore.

The film follows Alex, a psychopathic teenager, and pretty much the worse person to ever exist, played by Malcolm McDowell. This movie is truly a once in a lifetime experience, and needs to be had by everybody. There's just nothing bad about it, it's as perfect as you can get, and on top of that it's terrifying. The Beethoven music, and the cinematography are characters of their own, they just add so much to an already near perfect film. It's Kubrick's best in my opinion, and the best movie ever made."

The story of why the book was made is so shocking and sad (go look it up if you don't know it) that the movie makes sense and I see why all the sex/rape and violence is actually necessary.

Until a few months ago when it hit me. This movie is so deep. I first thought it was a psychological thriller intended to show how someone who is so bad can change and make you feel sorry for them. But no. It's about forgiving those who have done the unforgivable. The allegory of the book and movie is so movie that it's so clear to see after you know what has happened.<br/><br/>I hate this movie, but at the same time, it's a revolutionary, captivating, and mind-bending movie that keeps the viewer always thinking about this great, horrible, twisted, sad movie."

All of this with beautiful classical music. The words Alex uses, and the way he talks, is delicious to the ears. In one particular scene, he starts to listen to the ninth symphony, by Beethoven. And, in his own words, the symphony was gorgeousness and gorgeousity made flesh.

The soundtrack is excellent, and it's very well elected. Every track and every symphony suits perfectly every scene, and every action.

The words, the Rossini music that looks like it was made exactly for that scene, And he violence of Alex made me have a sensation that i can't put in words. The protagonist is wicked, and he is very bad. But very charismatic at the same time. The strange thing is that at the second half of the movie i felt bad for him, because he doesn't have free will.

","Today I've watched A CLOCKWORK ORANGE for the very first time. I had already seen other films from Kubrick as SHINING or EYES WIDE SHUT but I had never picked up this one, which is called to be one of his greatest masterpieces. Today I did it and I didn't regret as it is in fact a very good film! It stills not my favourite from this director since I liked those I did refer better, but it's a great movie with a great message.<br/><br/>It's not the best film ever made as some people say but I would not mind to call it a masterpiece because it really has some brilliant scenes, messing up with the ""standards of modern society"", religion, politics, and some of them are done with great sense of humor! One scene I recall, to be against the ""correct standards"" - and it should have been a ""shock"" back in 1971 - was that one when the leading character, by reading the bible, imagines himself whipping Christ on his way to the Calvary, wearing a Roman centurion uniform! It's done in such a way that it's even a bit humorous! <br/><br/>On the other hand I did appreciate the final message of the movie (at least what I understood from it...), which is either you play right or wrong, you do good or evil, you are always protected if you are with the mighty ones... Not that I agree or follow this, but it's in fact what happens in real life, and I see this film and this message as a way to criticize our ""modern societies"" and the way they are ruled nowadays. 1971 or 2015, at this issue the difference isn't that much...<br/><br/>The soundtrack is superb, it's based on classical music, but they put some ""futuristic"" electro-synthesized pieces of Beethoven in the most improvable scenes (violence, WWII...) <br/><br/>A great movie from a master called Stanley Kubrick!"

","""There was me, that is Alex, and my three droogs, that is Pete, Georgie, and Dim, and we sat in the Korova Milkbar trying to make up our rassoodocks what to do with the evening."" Stanley Kubrick was at the height of his creative prowess when he directed his triumphant 1971 film 'A Clockwork Orange', based off of the dystopian novella by Anthony Burgess in 1962. The story takes place in a futuristic Britain, where crimes are rampant and there is very little that can actually be done about it. Our main protagonist/villain is a young delinquent named Alex DeLarge (Malcolm McDowell) who is the leader of his gang of Droogs. The main interests of Alex is rape, committing ""ultraviolent"" acts after consuming drug-infused milk and listening to Beethoven. It is only when he accidentally kills a cat lady off with a phallic sculpture when attempting to burglarize her home that he is imprisoned and brainwashed into a descent citizen, via the Ludovico Technique, so that the mere thoughts of violence and sex nauseate him. In the end, he resorts to his former self after he attempts suicide and the government try to ""fix"" him again. <br/><br/>What is intended is to not only look at the context of this film as a contemporary, albeit bizarre unit, but to try and delve into the psyche of a fictional youth whose inner workings are never explained and what has slowly created his vile motivations over time. The film asks many questions but is given no solid answers to the viewer at hand. Are we still human beings when forcibly stripped from our willingness to choose good from bad, or just mere mechanisms that should gladly mold into the cogs of society? Are we supposed to sympathize with the mind-alteration of our main character or be repulsed by his past crimes? Let's take a look. <br/><br/>Burgess himself insisted that humans, by definition, have free will. The fact of the matter being, a culture will ultimately take drastic action to confine anyone into the gears of its clockwork rhythm when feeling threatened from a foreign disruption of normality. This particular film takes an interesting stance on how it wants to tell a story, slathered especially with a colorful Anglo-Russian rhyming slang called Nasdat which is used by the anti-hero Alex in first-person perspective here and there narrating throughout the film, also adapted from the book. The story takes place in near-future Britain of which we are not given any specific date or time. Alex is the devilish hooligan and leader of a gang of Droogs, whose hideout is a place called the Korova Milk Bar where he and his pals get hyped up for a night of mayhem and mischief of horrendous proportions after drinking milk laced with mescaline. From there, they beat up a rival gang, drive recklessly through the night in a stolen car and finally break into a futuristic-styled home of a couple of whom the Droogs beat up the husband, rape his wife and trash the place as Alex bounces a ball and taps his boots while belting out 'Singin' in the Rain'. After this he returns home to his dilapidated loft where he plays a cassette tape of Beethoven's 9th Symphony to put the final touch on the perfect evening, all the while fantasizing of orgies and acts of ""ultraviolence"". Since Alex has committed despicable acts with his gang, he is then imprisoned and becomes a guinea pig for a group of doctors who use his own classical music against him when they perform the Ludovico Technique upon our protagonist. They strap him in a straightjacket and stretch his eyes open with small rods as they force him to watch graphic films all to the music of Beethoven, as he is eventually brainwashed and conformed to a descent citizen and stripped of the love of his favorite composer so that any ideas of sex and violence ultimately sicken him. Upon his release, he encounters the tramp, of whom recognizes him whereas Alex does not. He and his chums beat up the now-defenseless post-Droog as the fight is broken up by two policeman, ironically former Droogs also, take Alex and dunk his head repeatedly in a trough of dirty water. Now that Alex is a decent citizen, society has reversed the effect of his former actions upon himself. So go the distorted mechanisms of the said title. <br/><br/>The resolution is left unsatisfying for the society in which Alex lives but satisfying for us in a sense because the mechanisms of this young rebel are far beyond fixing, as it was the culture that truly created him over time. We now have mixed emotions as we abhor the deplorable actions of Alex and yet feel sympathy for him when he is stripped of his free will and becomes like a dog in one of Pavlov's experiments. It is in the second half where we just have to wait and see how Alex will have to unwillingly accept his alteration to society and acknowledging the fact that he is now a decent civilian before descending back into his old sadistic habits. Alex, besides the other characters inhabiting the world of the film, seems to be the only one suffering from who he really is and when it is taken from him, he eventually has a mental breakdown and the gears are switched back to the terrible mechanisms of his past from an all-too-demanding culture telling him what he should say, do or think or who he should be. For Alex, a brainwashing may have lasted for a time, but not long enough to conform back to his old mechanisms into how the culture has truly geared him to be. Chock full of vibrant language and classical music while also mixing truth from lies, irony from satire and oxymoron from paradox, Kubrick's 'A Clockwork Orange' is indeed a frenzied fun house of macabre and mayhem."

He runs into his old Droogie buddies who have now become cops and they beat him unmercifully. Through an odd bout of karma, he ends up back in the home of Mr. Alexander. The man doesn't recognize him at first until he hears him singing, so he locks him in a room and plays Beethoven very loudly until Alex attempts suicide by jumping out the window. Waking up in the hospital, he is visited by several officials and is informed that the experiments were deemed unethical and so they begin a treatment to break him of his conditioning.<br/><br/>What makes Alex so fascinating is how specifically Kubrick presents him. He is a nasty little man, hell-bent on violence and mayhem. What is so unsettling is his pure joy. He isn't one of those angry youths who is striking back at society. He loves what he is doing. He is a man who loves life, loves to get out of bed in the morning and lives for every carnal lust he can propagate. He carries the demeanor and the curled smile of an unapologetic pervert (which he is) and we in the audience become conditioned to want to like him, to like his laughing demeanor, his bold song and dance even when he's committing unspeakable acts. His lust for life is infectious.<br/><br/>In the second half of the film, we are pulled in the other direction. We, as the viewer, are rational enough to know that he is committing acts of pure evil and so when he goes through experiments that make him sickened by his actions, we can't disagree. What makes Alex so interesting are his quirks: his cain and smoking jacket, his lust for Beethoven, his lust for young girls and his joy at beating his droogie underlings senseless. The film is unapologetically misogynistic, Kubrick surrounds him with phallic imagery from his codpiece to his pet snake to his cain, seemingly driven by his own testosterone. What I appreciate most is that Kubrick never gives Alex a reason for doing what he does. In most films like this, the villain is supplied with a childhood trauma, but Alex does what he does because he likes doing it."

","Like the glorious Ludwig Van, this film continues to affect each generation that embraces it or tries to ignore it. There's just nothing else like it, which was a Stanley Kubrick trademark from 2001 to Dr. Strangelove. But unlike those far-out fantasies, ""A Clockwork Orange"" seemed like it actually could become a frightening reality. Maybe that's why it has inspired perennial Hallowe'en costumes to rival KISS in rebellious popularity.<br/><br/>Many viewers hold political or religious grudges against ""A Clockwork Orange"", and I suppose it deserves any kind of ratings warning that makes parents feel comfortable enough to let their children view it (although they usually have done so already). Yet the ultra-violence is often strangely poetic, more artistic than gratuitous, and even at its most childish, it's a creepy, mischievous kind of immaturity that haunts both the polarizing Alex and the movie's audience.<br/><br/>Reading the book may help you better understand the film, although fanatics continue to vehemently disagree about ""what it really means"". It's irrelevant anyhow, because even if you end up confused by any of the plot, you'll realize you were too busy processing all the creative language, fierce action and indelible images you missed the first time you watched it."

","Whilst the reader of this review will question my title, I implore them to read the other reviews of this movie, and it will become clear why I chose such a title. This movie is purely dependent on the person watching the movie, what he/she takes from it.<br/><br/>The film was made in 1971, some 43 years before I'm writing this review. I have more pros then cons about this movie, but let's start with the cons. I felt the movie did not shock me as some other movies have, perhaps this is because in nearly half a century we have wised up to the deep, dark underbelly of this world or quite simply I have been exposed to it. Further to this, the film was a bit long to watch in one sitting. Finally, the actual lingo was a bit to hard to understand, and I've lived in England for 11 years now!<br/><br/>The positives were I thought the actual cinematography and filming of this was pretty good, and the main protagonists acting was second-to- none. More to the point, I really adore how this movie depicts that as a criminal, he continued to get away with multiple crimes but it was only once he became good (by force, may I add) that he was well and truly eaten up by the world. Whilst harsh, it shows that the world we live in now may not have much space left for the pure of heart anymore. To follow from this, I like how the main character shows that each human is different, and how when it comes to someone's mental state, anything can trigger a reaction unexpected. The best example of this is his reaction to Beethoven's 9th symphony. I especially like how the film portrays the underhanded dealings of a government, summed up in the scene at the end with the main character sitting with the Minister, whom speaks so politically in a way that basically depicts the sneaky way in which politicians go about their business.<br/><br/>Whilst I only gave this film a 7, I would say it is a much watch as there is something oddly fascinating about this film, and kudos to the director for filming it in such a way that everyone has a different opinion and focal point on the movie."

As the film progresses, you begin to see Alex change and become an upstanding citizen, or so it seems.

He learns of a new program the government is trailing on prisoners. They break them down and then rebuild the prisoners into the ""perfect citizen"". Alex eventually is experimented on and is released back into society ""rehabilitated"". The ethical question is then raised whether or not a man ceases to be a man without the power of choice. The slang language (Nasdat) is a very cool aspect of Alex Burgess' novel. It keeps the film futuristic in a sense. The sets are a visual feast - and Malcolm McDowell is perfectly cast as Alex!

"monika_kanashiro","10","0","4","22 January 2014"," My best cinematic decision
","I always heard people comment about this movie. So, I decided to watch it. And it was one of the best cinematic decisions. I never really read the book published in 1962 by Anthony Burgess. But after seeing the movie, I really want to read it. But let's talk about this incredible movie. As you might notice, the choice of this adjective that I gave for the movie summarizes what I thought about it. The actors, the director, the psychological plot, the movie set... holy crap! Alexander Delarge (Malcolm McDowell) as the protagonist really made the difference. I cannot think about another actor in his place. Stanley Kubrick, the director of this work of art ""A clockwork orange"" where he worked several different techniques uniting them all in this show that even after all these years still is among the most remembered and exciting movies. The plot is about the life of a young man named Alexander DeLarge. He is the leader of a gang of thugs. In one of his crimes, he is arrested. It is from here that starts an interesting theme. Inside the prison, there are political and religious approaches.And then, he is used as a guinea pig of the project ""healing of violence"". I'm not sure about the name of this project. I guess it is The Ludovico treatment. But the point it is the treatment he is subjected to is so hard. He is forced to watch scenes of violence on TV with the soundtrack – the ninth symphony of Beethoven (his favorite song). Although he likes the images of forced sex and violence, he has a reflux. That is the therapy, reverse therapy. Themes such as violence, brainwashing, free will guide the movie. While I watched the treatment of Alex made me remember that Big Brother Brazil started recently for the 14ºth time in Brazil. I never enjoy this kind of TV show. But I know that a lot of people watch and enjoy it. TV has a great power on people and this scares me. The TV show Big Brother Brazil was created based on this book Nineteen Eight-four. This book of Eric Arthur Blair also approaches this subject. His book portrays the daily life of a totalitarian and repressive political regime of the year (1984). Eric shows how an oligarchical collectivist society is able to suppress anyone who opposes her. Here it brings a polemical subject that is worked in the movie by Kubrick: the influence that TV has on people. That's why I really enjoy this movie. There is a huge possibility of discussion of the film in various areas and fields. As the narrator of the plot is the main character himself (Alex DeLarge),we (readers) stay close to the character and inevitably we support him.We believe on the transgression of Alex. There is an interesting fact about the movie set. The Korova Milk Bar was baptized after the Russian word for cow and his sculptures were based on the work of sculptor Allen Jones. One of the wall paintings appears in the movie The Shining, 1980 (Another movie that I really enjoy.) In the scene where Alex talks with the priest about the Ludovico treatment, you can see prisoners marching in a circle in the courtyard. This scene makes association with the painting by Vincent Van Gogh, Prisoners exercising (1980). I recommend not watching only once, but several times and trying to understand the proposal of this fantastic drama. However, it is always good to remember the age group indicated for the film because there are several strong scenes."

","Clockwork Orange: between the organic and the mechanic.<br/><br/>This movie is based on the eponymous book written by Anthony Burgess. It was released in 1971, in UK. The story is set in an imaginary future and tells the story of Alexander, the leader of a gang of young offenders that commits robberies and rapes at night only for fun. Alex has a thirst for power and due to this he had once fought his gang friends (called droogies) to maintain the power and control in his hands. After this episode, his friends decided to avenge him and arranged a trap to get him arrested. <br/><br/>In jail, Alex discovers a way to reduce his time there: participating in a new government program that studies a way to restrain the violent and social unacceptance impulses of human being. It is called Ludovico Technique and consists basically in an aversion therapy. There is a high dose of philosophy and psychology in this movie. <br/><br/>It includes behaviorism, the set of psychological theories that deal with the behavior. One of the pioneers in this field of study was Ivan Pavlov, who conducted a test with dogs and developed a model of conditioning behavior called ""conditioned reflex"", which states that behavior is a response to a specific stimulus. Pavlov believed that there were unconditioned reflexes (innate) and conditioned reflexes (learned) and proved with his test that it is possible to create or remove physiological and psychological responses in human beings and animals. It happened with the protagonist of the movie. During the Ludovico Technique, Alex was subjected to associate malaise – caused by medicine – to bad things that he used to do – like rape, stole etc. .<br/><br/>It worked. Then it comes the philosophy: can a technique make the human completely powerless regarding his choices? Because even Ludovico Technique has worked, Alex kept thinking in bad things; the treatment curbed his attitudes but not his thoughts. According to self- determination, people have liberty to make choices and it cannot be changed. For the philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre, the human is convicted to the liberty. Or mean, doesn't matter what is done, nothing can control the human mind (the closer to this is brain washing).<br/><br/>When Alex comes back to the society, the negative point of a social control is visible: he has to endure people doing bad things to him and he can't do anything back. Here the point is: whither a government intervention is legitimate? Can the government decide how people can act? Is it negative or positive? In Alex's case it was negative. People didn't change their vision about Alex when he returned back to the society, but only when he was victimized. Then comes to the fore all the government demagoguery, corruption and opportunism, because it takes advantage of Alex's case to do a self-promotion.<br/><br/>In the end, the lesson remaining is that people have their instincts and their own essence and nothing can change this. Society only tries to control the instincts considered bad or predatory, but it will always exist and sometimes it will surfacing.<br/><br/>With regard to acting, Malcolm McDowell did his role brilliantly. It is possible to see in his eyes the indifference or sociopathy during scenes of heavy violence. Alex did not care about other's feelings; he was completely hedonist and egocentric. Beyond the great interpretation of Dowell, there is a big dose of perfectionism from Stanley Kubrick, the director. Kubrick's style is apparent: narration, symmetrical composition, extensive zoom sequences and an observation of the dark side of human.<br/><br/>It is almost unbelievable and unacceptable that Clockwork Orange did not receive any Oscar. But it is still a good movie to watch and think about life and human relationship. If you ask for a rating to this movie, ""10' cannot be fair. Just watch and understand what is being said here."

Alex breaks up the gang, and is captured by the authorities, who make him the willing subject of an experiment where all the aggressive thoughts are wiped from his mind, leaving him practically helpless later, when he is declared ""cured"" and sent back into society, where he will then reap what he has sewn...<br/><br/>Of course, that's part of the point, that unless you cure society of the very thing you would cure an individual, you will still be left with a problem. Seeing Alex get punished by those he victimized is without doubt satisfying(Charles Bronson would have shot these punks dead without a second thought in his ""Death Wish"" films!)So Kubrick puts the viewer in the exact position of the avenging victims, which can also be uncomfortable on reflection, but we know exactly what Alex did, though was that part of him really cured? Is it dead? Or can it be revived? The difference between violence being sanctioned or unsanctioned, depending on whether they work for the government or not(as some of the gang will...) Kubrick gives the audience much to consider in this shocking film, not always easy to watch(to say the least) but one that cannot be easily dismissed either, though it was banned for years, but can now be seen on DVD."

Of course his physical traits allow him to portray Alex, whereas, his psychological traits portray a remarkable; gentlemanly character.

So I gave it a try and I must say I do not regret it. Although this isn't a new movie, with all the special effects that we are presented nowadays, the plot is great, it's very fresh, different from what I'm used to see and for me that is always awesome. Another fantastic thing about this movie it's the soundtrack. It's amazing how Beethoven can transform a horribly violent scene into something still violent but classy (not that violence becomes acceptable, but the scenes don't get vulgar, trashy and for someone like me, who isn't a fan of violent movies, that is quite good). Then there's Alex, which for me is one of the most charismatic characters I've ever seen. He has no sense, no good, he's evil, a psychopath, but a very unique one. The performance of Malcolm McDowell is simply amazing! So if you like movies about crime, violence but with some message, some lesson about society and with a classy touch this is very indicated. It doesn't get boring and you realize that society didn't change so much since the time the movie was made: we still search for the best way to threat a criminal and the cynicism from our minister to just look good no matter what it's still there too. Short story I loved the movie and I most certainly recommend it."

"girald03","7","0","2","16 June 2013"," Remarkable editing
","A Clockwork Orange (1971) directed by Stanly Kubrick, is a powerful entry in the dystopian future film genre. In Britain, Alex (Malcolm McDowell) is the leader of his gang of delinquents, whom he calls his ""droogies,"" and together they go around the city terrorizing citizens with violent acts such as beating and rape (Kubrick, 1971). During their first big robbery where Alex accidentally kills a woman, his ""droogies"" attack him and leave him to be caught by the police. In prison, Alex signs up for a mysterious new treatment that will supposedly fix the crime problem in Britain. However, the treatment only alters Alex's behavior with physical pain rather than change his actual will to commit evil acts. Alex leaves prison and returns to a society that rejects him for his past mistakes, and is found taken advantage of by a subversive writer, Mr. Alexander (Patrick Magee), who wants a good story against the government's new anti-crime methods.<br/><br/>A major theme in A Clockwork Orange is free will. Throughout the plot the director shows that chaos in society cannot be reversed by taking away the free will of the citizens. Similarly, in Kubrick's The Shining, the importance of free will is emphasized when Jack Torrence's lack of free will proves detrimental by leading him to attempt to kill his family, and eventually, to his downfall (Plot summary for the shining, n.d.).<br/><br/>In A Clockwork Orange, Kubrick establishes the chaotic society Britain has become. In the first scene, by using low-key lighting the director ""creates a somber mood"" and highlights the beggar when he comments on how there is no more law and order in the world (Boggs & Petrie, 2008, p.114). The side lighting creates long sharp shadows of the four gang members to emphasize the darkness and the evil within them. In contrast, during the scene where Alex has to prove the treatment has been successful, back lighting focused just on Alex is used to indicate that Alex's new behavior is under a microscope as seen by the audience in front of him, but that he himself cannot see clearly, further emphasizing his uncertain future.<br/><br/>The editing in A Clockwork Orange is remarkable. It starts with an inside-out editing sequence, where the first scene is introducing the milk bar, and from there the viewer is emerged into the idiosyncratic futuristic world through various fast-changing violent scenes. Kubrick uses creative juxtaposition to expose the high range of immorality in the futuristic society. This fact is exposed as the statue of the dancing Jesuses are frozen and montaged to create movement when ""dancing"" to Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. The slow-motion scene where Alex assaults his friends intensifies the emotional effect for both Alex and the viewer (Boggs & Petrie, 2008).<br/><br/>Kubrick effectively communicates the immorality in the future world by diminishing the surprise of immoral acts, while also increasing the emotional effect to Alex himself while committing immoral acts. By exposing the detriments of the lack of free will, Kubrick is perhaps attempting to motivate his viewers to not give up their freedom to institutions such as the government, or to society's constructs, even in spite of problems that may be caused by free will such as violence and crimes."

","A Clockwork Orange set the world on fire when it was released back in 1972 because of the controversial violence. Forty-one years later, this movie is still one of the most violent movies I have ever seen. Despite that, this is also Kubrick's best movie and he is the guy who directed Barry Lyndon, The Shining, and Full Metal Jacket. This film is also delightfully weird. The main character, Alex and his pals speak in some kind of weird English that is amusing to listen to.<br/><br/>Kubrick's film is set in the future and is about a guy named Alex. He is a nasty hoodlum who has no problem in being a very violent, sadistic rapist. But when he gets sent to prison, he joins a program where he can be cured of any violent thoughts.<br/><br/>Malcolm McDowell did a really good job portraying Alex. For the first half of the film, I have come to despise Alex for the person he was. But the last half of the film, I couldn't help but feel sorry for him and the misery he goes through.<br/><br/>Overall, this is Kubrick at his very best. He paints a bleak picture on human society in the future and his messages about mankind are very thorough. In today's age, I'm surprised this movie held up the way it has because of how the taste of moviegoers changed. This may not have any explosions, but this is a compelling film about the good and bad sides of human nature. Be warned: This film contains many graphic images and intolerable crimes. But, this is an excellent movie. I rate this film 10/10."
"Sonic_Ocean","10","0","3","29 May 2013"," Grotesque in its satire, yet hypnotic to the point you are drawn to its allure, as how one would be analyzing a beautiful painting
","A film that is just as artful as it crazy, whether it be its visuals that are flamboyantly colorful, its use of Beethoven to compliment Alex's over-the-top personality, or its clever dialogue. This is a film like no other that portrays a society that blurs the line between good and evil, filled with characters possessing many different oddities, where the sane and insane are basically one and the same. Every line of dialogue is witty and quotable, that it makes every situation in the movie even way more absurd than it already is, in a really good way.<br/><br/>Malcolm McDowell is legendary in this and delivers a performance so electrifying that it will send shivers down your spine. He definitely brings out the most out of a character who is rebellious without any sense of constraint, and to see him suffer through what he's put through later on in the movie makes me feel a bit of sympathy for him, strangely, but just when we feel bad for him, he'll fill you up with disgust, once again to remind you how much he values his own grotesque freedom. His actions may be evil, but on the different sides of the spectrum, which are the sides of the good, 'do you're told' law abiding citizen to the anti-conformists, both their actions are situated in the utmost extremes that point out the flaws in each of their convictions.<br/><br/>While both flawed, the story definitely serves its purpose of satirizing a society that values its convictions in establishing order through a system that forces everyone to conform to what constitutes a good citizen. How can society grow if we cannot let aspects of our individuality flourish? And although we should conform to having a good sense of morality, unlike Alex, we should still be able to exercise our right to freedom, instead of letting ourselves be oppressed by what society deems as 'ideal' living. And although the film leaves out the last chapter of the novel, I feel the choice of going with this ending makes just as strong of statement either way in pointing out society's flawed system.<br/><br/>To sum everything up, 'A Clockwork Orange' is everything a satire should be, in that it is so shocking that it is able to get its points across directly. This is a film that shows ambition, but at the same time can make you laugh hysterically at things you'd feel strange for laughing at and whenever I watch this film, I feel a little twisted myself. While there are certain scenes that induce a feeling of disgust, there are many scenes that are just hilarious, and that is due to the outrageous dialogue. From watching every character interact with each other to listening to Alex's narration, there are so many overwhelmingly good lines filled with so much wit that this is bound to be a film you'd want to revisit again and again. To have a film mix dark humor with acts of a grotesque nature is one the weirdest dynamics in film and this is what I think that captivates many people to watch this film. On that note, that is what makes 'Clockwork' so great in that it executes what it sets out to do so well that you will find yourself trying not to look away at the screen, despite the horrific events that occur within in the film, and a film that can captivate me that much is in every way deserving of the title as a classic."

All his sinful life is presented very sinfully, we wish that he should be punished. And he does get his share in the prison.<br/><br/>But the government introduces new law of changing the criminals into non -violent citizens. Alex seems very co-operating towards this new approach, but finds out that even with his will he can't do those violent activities again.<br/><br/>When he is released into the real world, all that used to be before gets changed and he got beat down so much so that we feel pity for him."

","It is very difficult to view this film without experiencing ""nausea"" from watching all forms of violence and sickening rape scenes. Kubrick has twisted all the violent sequences in a pure artistic way. The first 45 minutes of the film is riveting and disturbing. It's quite fast paced. The main antihero, Alex Delarge, is best described as knowingly evil, but seemingly having a innocent charisma. He part of a teenage gang who speaks in a weird slang, Nadsat. It was a mode of speech used by the teenage subculture in a futuristic Great Britain. It was developed by the author of the book, Anthony Burgess. The protagonist himself is considered too human because of his driven desire for ""ultra-violence"" and rape. His narration gives the audience an impression of his ""authoritative nature."" I don't want to give away most of the details of the film, but despite the excess violence, this film successfully depicts the ""state of nature"" our society is currently undergoing. Teen subculture has developed during the late 20th century. However, viewers will have to exercise discretion. Certain scenes may traumatize some folks."
"ahicks1130","7","0","3","3 May 2013"," Very different movie, certainly worth watching
","""A Clockwork Orange"" is considered by many to be a classic. Stanley Kubrick's unique style is on full display in this thriller that can be very graphic at times. Some scenes are twisted, some are gut wrenching, and some are outrageous. While the film is certainly not for everyone, it is fantastically different than most films ever made. Kubrick is not afraid to push the limits and refuses to follow the guidelines laid out by most movies. The uniqueness alone makes ""A Clockwork Orange"" worth watching. <br/><br/>The star of this film is Alex DeLarge. He is a homicidal rapist and killer who assumes the role of a regular, every day student during the day. Alex and his friends deceive innocent people in order to gain access to their home. Once inside, they torture and kill the unsuspecting victims. Their scheme works on most occasions. One night however, a woman refuses to let them in. She calls the cops instead. Alex, having none of that, breaks in to her house while his friends wait outside. He murders the lady in a very graphic manner. While inside, he hears the sirens of the police on the way. In a panic, Alex quickly runs outside and meets his friends. What Alex is not counting on is that his friends turn on him. They bash him over the head and flee so that Alex is arrested and they get away easy. <br/><br/>Alex becomes the ideal inmate while in prison. He is friendly with guards, plays by the rules, and even takes to reading the bible. As part of being the stand-up citizen in prison, he agrees to be part of an experimental type of treatment. A therapy of sorts, accomplished through a group of rehabilitation sessions. The goal of these sessions is to cure him of the violence that remains inside his mind. The curing sessions turn out to be incredibly violent. They are some of the more gruesome scenes most will ever see. One of the more unique pieces of ""A Clockwork Orange"" is the soundtrack featured during some of the violent scenes. The music is almost whimsical, certainly not fitting with what most would associate with the actions taking place. <br/><br/>Malcolm McDowell does an excellent job portraying Alex Delarge in this film. What I liked most is the realism in his character. Despite everything he went through, in the end, Alex remains just as evil as he always was. There aren't always happy endings or feel good stories in real life. Sometimes people are sick. While normally very likable as an actor, McDowell does a great job of keeping his character dislikable in this role. He really shows few redeemable qualities. Kubrick also deserves a great deal of credit for directing McDowell in this role. It is fairly easy to follow Hollywood's tried and true path of stories that send the audience home happy. It is quite difficult to be different and to risk your career as a director to put something out there that does not fit the norm."

","Historically controversial, Stanley Kubrick succeeded in doling out a statement never repeated in popular film making: that government mandated reconditioning, parole (if you will)will fail under the best conditions. The morally anemic yet intelligent hooligan Alex de Large (Malcolm McDowell) horrifically plays out this futuristic England social statement, shocking viewers and gaining acclaim for sheer boldness. Disturbing and meaningless violence plays out while the Droogs follow along through peer pressure. Futuristic?

"aaditya-swaroop","9","0","1","18 October 2012"," ""Its funny how the colors of the real world only seem really real when u viddy them on the screen""
","Stanley Kubrick was a celebrated director and screenplay writer that gave us cinematic masterpieces like 2001: A space Odyssey, the shining, full metal jacket and the list goes on. A clockwork orange is a part of this special list. Though it lost the race for the Best movie Oscar to ""The French Connection"" in 1972, I bellieve it could have gone either way - both being trendsetters & works of inspirational cinema.<br/><br/>When I started the movie, the first shot really set my mood - The smirk on Alex's face, those eyes full of determination, hatred, scorn, revenge, unremitting, intense - just ripping through the viewer and sending a chilling message down the spine. Before Alex was imprisoned, Stanley Kubrick presented a theatrical piece of anarchy brought about in a devilish manner. Sometimes it felt like Nihilism and sometimes, just pure & unadultered paranoia. Malcom McDowell's portrayal of Alex's character must be commended - There was a sense of symphony to Alex and what he did, as if he was performing with the background music. It was like watching a concert.<br/><br/>But the highlight of this movie was not the plot, but the theatrical extremities in which the cast portrayed their characters. This was brought together with detailed camera-work, background music, sets, artwork, make-up and symbolism. Specific sequences in the storyline helped in building up the feeling of hoodlumism and anarchy - billy & his boys raping a young girl, the garbage lying around when Alex was returning home from his evening odyssey, the vandalized art pieces, broken lift, artwork at the milkbar. Stanley Kubrick did well to create an atmosphere for Alex's delinquent behaviour. The background score added to the overall drama. Throughout the movie, most of the scenes had concert music in the background, even during acts of crime or action sequences - like when Alex and his droogs were beating Billy & his boys. When there was no music, there was silence with the dialogues echoing in the room, as if live theatre performances were getting delivered. It helped in building up the concert/theatre feeling very nicely. <br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick did well with artwork and make-up that denoted underlying sexuality and anarchism. Detailed creativity like Alex's eyelashes and the piece of art at the murdered lady's house are classic. The poster of clockwork where Alex is peeking out with his eyelashes & smirk, still gives me a quirky feeling. Knowing that Stanley himself was an avid photographer & knew all about cinematography, it isn't a surprise that in the credits under cinematography, John Alcott's name has been mentioned only as lighting cameraman. Stanley manipulated the camera-work that suited his style & which went with the movie's flavour - the close faceshots, camera-work from unique angles to shoot the characters.<br/><br/>All in all, a clockwork orange is a masterpiece from Stanley Kubrick, in his long list of successful pieces of work. It is worth mentioning here that clockwork is by no means an easy film to watch and/or understand, as many will be turned off by the explicit violence and rape. It'll make the viewer heavy-headed and leave the theatre in shock. But that was Mr.Kubrick's style afterall - Shock & Awe. This is a brand of cinema which'll live on for many years to come.<br/><br/>Score - 8.5 out of 10. Definitely recommended if you have got a taste for drama."

","A Clockwork Orange (to me) may not be Kubrick's best, but it's still an extremely entertaining and thought provoking piece of cinema. We follow the adventures of a young man named Alex. A deliciously evil gangster in a British dystopia that takes part in acts of rape and ""ultra-violence"" throughout the first part of the movie. The second act is spent observing Alex's day-to-day life as a prisoner until he volunteers to be a part of a new treatment that could turn the subject against their violent urges. In the final act, we see the fallout from the treatment as Alex returns to society. All of it is driven by the charisma and gleeful madness of Malcolm McDowell as our protagonist. The supporting cast of the film is also top-notch. They include Fredrick (Anthony Sharp),Deltoid (Aubrey Morris), the Droogs (James Marcus, Warren Clarke and Michael Tarn), and Mr. Alexander (Patrick Magee). The film's haunting visuals and use of classical music make this film a hard one to forget. Every shot of it is like something you would witness in some sort of bizarre dream.

"samuelactually","8","0","1","18 August 2012"," Beethoven's Ninth Symphony the theme for ""Ultra-violence""
","wiki synopsis: Alex (Malcolm McDowell), the main character, is a charismatic, sociopathic delinquent....... He leads a small gang of thugs (Pete, Georgie, and Dim), whom he calls his droogs (from the Russian друг, ""friend"", ""buddy""). The film chronicles the horrific crime spree of his gang, his capture, and attempted rehabilitation via controversial psychological conditioning.<br/><br/>My comments: The premise of the story centres on the main character Alex. Alex takes what he wants and does it a way that alienates him from the audience. He is set up as unlikable. Calculating, manipulative, violent, cruel, vindictive, individualistic, uncaring even sadistic. However, all these traits make him top dog and successful {at least at what he does in his small world}. That is until he is betrayed by his gang members and is sent to prison. <br/><br/>He would probably have been alright in prison {he manages to cosy up with the prison chaplin by faking religious conviction} but as always when offered a seemingly easy way out he decides to take it. He ""volunteers"" for a scientific trial of a new therapy that produces a extreme physical reaction in the subject when aggressive feeling start to surface. <br/><br/>Released from prison Alex is now defenceless in a violent world. His old friends {who are now police officers}, his past victims and his family all now have the upper hand and act in similarly vindictive and cruel way.<br/><br/>Thus the philosophy of the film plays out. Is Alex a product of society? Are we all Alex in some way? Is Alex part of human nature? Is punishing Alex make us more violent? Is the science of human behaviour dehumanising? Will the government use this Science to control us and gain more power?"
"mtthwibrahim","7","0","1","29 July 2012"," A lesser Kubrick work, but still quite good
","Besides his masterpiece, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", ""A Clockwork Orange"" tends to get labeled the finest work by arguably the most important film maker of all time. Being a rather avid fan of his work, I imagine I'd fall into the minority, because I think this is only third tier Kubrick. My main problem with the film is it's theme, which is no more insightful than what you'd hear on Fox News. Seriously, does anyone buy into this whole ""a dark tomorrow full of violence"" crap. It's this sort of childish misanthropy that just makes my humanist blood boil. Sadly, there are murderers and rapists, people just like Alex today, and they've been there, and they'll continue be here throughout time. However, the thought that, in the future, these people will be everywhere and we can do nothing to stop them is silly. The fact that this is wildly considered a deep film that merits excessive discussion puzzles me. Roger Ebert (who sucks, for the most part) called it a ""right wing paranoia fantasy"", and I'm definitely inclined to agree <br/><br/>That said, it's still a Kubrick film. The directing is top notch as usual, Kubrick's usual brand of innovative camera work, and the sound editing s great as well, giving the film a very effective atmosphere. The film is noted for it's incredibly unnerving scenes depicting sadism, which I have to agree are quite traumatizing, but Kubrick has the tact to make it not seem exploitative or just made to shock for the sake of shocking. And, of course, McDowell; god, did he ever have stage presence. Thankfully, Kubrick also doesn't shove the message down your throat in a painfully unsubtle manner, which does make the film a LOT easier to appreciate.<br/><br/>Looking past the idiotic thematic and the fact that a large portion of this film's fan base are made up of obnoxious teenagers, ""A Clockwork Orange"" is pretty great film, especially when looked at from a strictly technical standpoint. But Kubrick has many better films, and not just ""2001"" and Dr. Strangelove"""

","When I first started watching this film, I absolutely hated it. I didn't understand how it had such a high rating considering how graphic the rape/violent scenes are at the beginning. Then, as the movie went on, I found myself starting to enjoy it and put it all into context. It takes you into the eyes of a twisted minded young individual in a futuristic Britain, who eventually overcome his desire for the rape and violence to innocent women. It's very clever how this film can easily relate to people who are like that today, and the terrible consequences they go through even after they've been punished. I feel Malcolm McDowell played his part very convincingly, especially the way he has to power to make the viewer feel disturbed and disgusted at his actions. By the end of the film, he remarkably makes the viewer feel sympathy towards him. To be able to change the viewers opinion of such a strong character is very clever.<br/><br/>I never thought that after the first 20 mins of this film that I could possibly enjoy it, but I was definitely proved wrong and deserves a good 8/10 from me."

","A Clockwork Orange is the 1971 classic, directed by cinematic genius Stanley Kubrick. I suppose one of the great elements to this film is its visual and aesthetic qualities that makes this film a worth wild experience. The film features images that are just so brilliantly conceived that they stay with you for a long time.<br/><br/>The film begins with the introduction of Alex (In a tour-de-force performance by Malcolm McDowell) and his three droogies. As they walk along the streets of a very futuristic London, they create a presence that is based on control, power and dominance. This becomes evident in the first three minutes of the film. when the droogies are introduced to a tramp, sitting underneath a walkway bridge. As they show their dominance, they are engaged with illegal activities that involves the rape of a woman, the stealing of a car, violence and sex. <br/><br/>As he later becomes caught by the police engaging in such illicit activities, he is sent to prison, focusing on becoming cured, through the use of Aversion Therapy. As he gets better and avoids the urges of engaging in such violent and sexual acts, he leaves, trying to regain his life again. However, his life almost turns against him, not allowing him to get a second chance. <br/><br/>A Clockwork Orange is based on the Anthony Burgess novel of the same name.

"Magenta_Bob","9","0","2","23 May 2012"," A Clockwork Orange
","Surely A Clockwork Orange has to be one of the most twisted and disturbing films to reach any sort of mainstream popularity. As is perhaps symbolized by the first frames of the opening titles, which are soaking in a blood red colour then turning to blue, it follows Alex DeLarge's transition from brutal crook to cured model citizen (and back again?).<br/><br/>With Clockwork, Stanley Kubrick builds an incredibly visually rich dystopia, where every other shot seems to have fascistic, religious or some other allusions hidden somewhere in the screen. Some have complained that Kubrick is hitting the viewer over the head with his message (with a giant porcelain penis, if you will), but I think there are some subtleties hidden beneath the highly stylized and over the top surface, like with all the talk about whether or not a man without moral choice is a man at all, and how after being fed with ultra-violence for the first hour, the first thing that genuinely disturbs me is when the authorities abuse Alex. There is something deeply unsettling about the scene where Alex is being assaulted on stage to the enthusiastic applause of important government figures, more so than when a woman is being raped on stage in front of the viewers of the film, for some reason.<br/><br/>Apart from the compositions, the film has the great direction that can be expected from Kubrick. Is also has great music; apart from classic pieces by Ludwig van and songs like Singin' in the Rain, which are often used as contrasts to great effect, the main theme is truly hypnotic.<br/><br/>Maybe with the exception of the surreal and sexually charged Eyes With Shut, it feels like A Clockwork Orange stands out a bit from Kubrick's filmography due to the unrestrained style and violent nature. However, it still feels decidedly Kubrickian by being almost as visionary as 2001 and as frightening as The Shining."
"max-swindlehurst","10","0","2","21 May 2012"," A classic. One of Kubrick's best films.
","It only occurred to me very recently that I should watch A Clockwork Orange and after watching it I can only say that I am sorry that I waited so long to see it. I have always been very curious about the film as the fact that it was withdrawn from the UK built up so much mystery around it.<br/><br/>It is quite a difficult film to watch as the expectation you have leaves you with a feeling that you are going to be let down. However, thankfully this wasn't the case for me as I was quite mesmerised by what I can only call a true work of art. Unfortunately I have not read the book so I can't compare it to the film. This is a film that operates on many levels and explores a lot of ideas. I think the film is primarily concerned with ideas surrounding volition, control, violence (sexual and non sexual), fantasy and psychopathy.<br/><br/>The plot follows Alex a sociopath who ends up being a kind of antihero by the latter stages of the film. Alex is a character who as the famous tagline for the film states has made rape, Beethoven and violence his hobbies. I can't help wondering if this isn't reference to Adolf Hitler who was well known for his love of classical music (Wagner). The opening scene is nothing short of stunning. There then follows equally impressive scenes of ultra stylish yet very disturbing violence. The plot moves from a point where Alex is in complete control to one where he is vulnerable and he finally becomes a victim not a perpetrator of violence. I think that the thing that is most worrying about the film is that the moral order is not restored by the end. Although Alex suffers a bit this is not because he is genuinely guilty for his offences it is only due to the behavioural psychology treatment he receives which causes him to feel pain. The story offers much to the viewer to consider, my attention certainly didn't wander and you may be surprised to find quite a few humorous scenes.<br/><br/>I can't fault the performances of any of the cast members. The performances are totally convincing and affecting even if the droogs (Alex's gang) look a little old to be teenagers and the presence of Warren Clarke is slightly amusing as I couldn't help picturing him in the BBC TV police drama he stars in, Dalziel and Pascoe.<br/><br/>As mentioned before the film opens brilliantly. There really isn't to my mind a single unmemorable scene in the film. The production is wonderful, the colour lavish and every scene makes you feel as though you are there, a guilty spectator.<br/><br/>The script is very powerful. This is because of the use of what I believe is a sort of secret language that the writer of A Clockwork Orange, Burgess, devised called Nadsat.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is key in the movie as it ties into the plot and ironically it does get you interested in classical music, something which in the film Alex tells two minor characters is extremely important as it is so gorgeous.<br/><br/>This film has much to say about British society and it is sad that it had to be withdrawn for so long. It is a haunting and brave film that preys on the mind of the viewer. This is a necessary addition to any movie lover's film collection."

The intrepid and wicked character Alex Delarge is one of my favourite evil characters.He is young cunning and dangerously mischievous with a devil wisdom which helps him get out of trouble.His character is presented so meticulously and delicately that you'll believe this character is real(great performance by Malcom Mcdowell).Every scene in the movie is an art despite its weirdness.Even the scene where Alex and his droogs rape an innocent woman is shot in an artistic way that you'll enjoy and be traumatized at the same time.Also the fake and goofy dialogue delivery by the characters is made so well suited for this spooky comic movie and it will also remind you of Beethoven symphonies at the background scores. Hats off to Stanley Kubrick for blending this sort of weird combinations into a masterpiece. One thing I like about him is that he puts in florid details in his movies like the costumes,the unique sets which makes the movie very realistic. All in one it's a movie you must watch.I'm sure you'll love it.The more you watch it better it gets.Hollywood has very few masterpieces like this movie so I'll rate it a perfect 10/10.RIP sir Stanley Kubrick."

The juxtaposition is jarring.<br/><br/>With the depth of 5 films, A Clockwork Orange speaks about so much more than violence and sex. Youth/elderly relations, society, government, youth, good and evil, morals and choices, and violence and sex are portrayed in one of the densest films I've ever seen. Specifically the government aspect hit me: throughout the film a viewer wonder whether the film argues for the left or right side, but I concluded that it fights for neither: it argues against both sides, with no right answer. Complete destruction, like the characters. Genius!<br/><br/>More than a thematic film, Clockwork is visually quirky as well. Taking place in the near future, although by now it actually the near past, the world hasn't changed too much, but the changes are zany. Women have fully coloured wigs, drug bars exist, and the interior decorators were probably tripping on said milk. Like the Fallout game series, there's a certain culture freeze: cars and music haven't really advanced. The world is strange looking, and even more strange acting, but that's another stroke of genius. Look outside, people are practically orange! What we value is just as strange as what Clockwork's does. Another poke at society.<br/><br/>Then there's the characters... let's start with Alex. Alex is a bad guy, no doubt about it. You certainly won't want to admit that, seeing how charismatic and likable he is. His iconic clothes, slang and attitude harbor feelings in us that deep down... we want to be him. As my friend described him, ""God I hate him so much but I feel bad for him, y'know?""<br/><br/>Also notable are Alex's parents. Like in Rebel Without a Cause, there is disconnection, a generation gap between them and Alex. His parents are total pushovers, ignorant and meek. They try to avoid problems: through them, it becomes apparent how Alex became how his is, without anyone to keep him in check.<br/><br/>Several Kubrick staples return, including Alex's fantastic narration and the mythical, otherworldly music. The brilliant synth score sets the tone immediately, while the classical music Alex loves so, so much is the opposite of the horrors presented on screen. <br/><br/>Simply, A Clockwork Orange has some of the best structure and flow in film. There are three distinct acts, with individual scenes that each have a unique identity, serving several purposes, connecting, foreshadowing, symbolizing. These are classic scenes, all recognizable, no filler. And the pacing, which could have been slowed to help stomach the brutality, was not. It's very quick.<br/><br/>A cynical masterpiece with an eye to point out everything wrong with everything, I did something that I've never done before with a film: I watched it again the day after to really take it all in. A brilliant film, decades ahead of the times, an iconic classic. Kubrick immediately topped his previous work, 2001. 9.6/10"

","Of all the movies I've seen, I'd have to say this was one of the oddest experiences I've had. For a while I wasn't sure whether to love or hate it. Of all Kubrick's movies (that I've seen), I'd say this one is the most interesting. It shows the darker side of life, and how everyone participates in perpetuating that. To me it seems to be about how society thinks it can just fix people, change them, and then over tolerate them. But I don't want to simply say what I think the movie is supposed to mean. It's a powerful film that will make you reexamine society and the monsters that hide within it. It also struck me as a little surreal, like many of Kubrick's films tend to. Odd settings and powerful performances make this a compelling movie that should watched with caution."

","This film shows the moral choice one has to be evil or good. The soundtrack (which is beautiful) fits perfectly with Alex's evil mind, but to him seems just a way of life which he enjoys thoroughly and the music isn't dark and evil as what you see on screen. The futuristic slang is slightly confusing but at the same time very clever. Anyone who wants to enjoy this film thoroughly i definitely recommend watching more than once. I started off hating Alex at the beginning but by the end found him rather addictive and feeling sorry for him. After the Ludovico treatment, Alex cannot do any bad without feeling sick and is left with no moral choice. Hence the name 'A Clockwork Orange'. He is merely a man under complete control by the government and is stripped of all the qualities which somehow make him charming. He is definitely the greatest villain of all time as he still has class and is merely a man who has chosen evil over good. This film is a work of art, strange yet realistic. Alex is a 10/10 Kubrick portrayal of the book 10/10 and i am yet to read the book. Powerful from the start to end."

","""A Clockwork Orange"" is such an amazing film that no words can do it justice. It was originally banned for it's violent subject matter, and unjustly snubbed at the Oscars--no surprise.<br/><br/>But like all classics it has endured the test of time, and now stands as one of the most cerebral films ever made. Stanley Kubrick the auteur synonymous with films like: ""The Shining,"" ""Full Metal Jacket,"" and ""Dr. Strangelove..., creates a believable dystopian society; that is at once right, as it is wrong. The film features an amazing multi-faceted performance from Malcolm Mcdowell, and a vivacious directing approach by Stanley Kubrick: Kubrick's jarring visual style forces the viewers, to experience what Alex--Malcolm Mcdowell--experiences. The films paradoxical nature is so tuned that it puts the audience on the fence; on one end Alex is a vicious, and sickening person. But halfway through the film as he is cured--by too much of anything is bad treatment--,and released. He becomes the victim , and while the audience at first probably jives with his vilification; eventually the abuse continues, and you end up sympathizing with a character who is innately evil, and one you abhorred in the beginning. All in all do yourself a favor, and go watch ""A Clockwork Orange"", and than try to listen to ""Singin' in the Rain"" without remembering the film."

","Millions of words have been written about A Clockwork Orange. The social, psychological, political, ethical, moral views Etc. Etc. To say this film was a LITTLE controversial when it came out......is like saying George W. Bush is only a LITTLE stupid. Stanley Kubrick and his family got death threats---he had it shelved---and ordered that it never be shown in the U.K. until after his death.(Thats what happened). The story is actually very simple...bad boy commits murder...he is trialled on a new ""cure"" for BAD PEOPLE...one of his victims gets revenge...the ""cure"" doesn't work. Its psycho / sexual Hans Christian Anderson. Goldilocks with vodka and lime & bitters twist. Snow White and the seven erections. There are (of course) very confronting scenes---the rape seen--where the husband is forced to watch. The middle aged fruit cake who gets smashed in the head with a giant penis. A few other milder bits of violence. Kubricks direction is O.K. (a little pedestrian at times). The script is average. The actors do there thing. Its no where near being a classic. Its only A Clockwork Orange. (It is...however...an above average movie.)<br/><br/>."

","I had delayed watching this film solely because I did not really enjoy 2001: A Space Odyssey that much as most film critics do. I have to admit I was a bit afraid of watching Kubrick's films after that. ""A Clockwork Orange"", however, has showed me something I never thought possible -- the ultimate artistic form of a courageous visionary and a mix of messages concerning our society.<br/><br/>What starts out as a portrait of a few British teenagers' gang life in a near future has evolved into much, much more. The true beauty of this artwork begins to surface as the ""treatment"" of ""curing"" a person is introduced, and our title character, Alex, volunteers for such an experiment without second thoughts. The real question is perhaps: How do we cure a corrupted mind? Or is there something out there we call a corrupted mind? If such a mind exists, and is born, given inherently in such a way, is changing it a moral choice? Morality. Perhaps that is another social commentary that has made the film so great and definitely a classic to be remembered. What about crimes, psychology, sociology, or even politics? One may think that such complex systems and thoughts cannot possibly be expressed in merely hours, but this masterpiece proves this way of thinking wrong. Putting together an intriguing story and a huge amount of hidden messages, this is a movie that interests as well as inspires. It inspires its viewers to look further into our society.<br/><br/>As thought-provoking as it is, you may think that it does not matter. After all, you may complain about its relevance to our post-modern world, since it has been 41 years. Nevertheless, that is not the case. It is the first time I watch this, and I am already able to relate a lot of the contents and meanings to the society we are living in right now. It is undoubtedly a controversial work, for both its purpose and probably more so for its explicit scenes. Remember it was made back in 1971, though I think it will still be a powerful film were it made this year. It is the kind of film with deep and inspirational intrinsic values that time cannot melt away.<br/><br/>Different people may love this Kubrick work for different reasons. To me, this is my favorite Kubrick films up to date (I have not watched all his films). Perhaps it is the interesting and unique plot that draws you in, or perhaps it is the controversial or the slight touch of anti-cultural excitement that keeps you excited. Either way, in terms of story, what we are given is linear-storytelling at its best. It is solid, proper-paced and it captures the right emotions. When it comes to the message, most likely it will end up with different interpretations. No matter what you think, after watching this, you will feel like you have a lot to express in your mind. You suddenly think a lot of things that are inside your mind are touched, and there is also an inflow of new ideas of this world we are living in, and of course, human nature.<br/><br/>I do not usually write many and long paragraphs in reviews, because often you do not have to say much about a film for people to actually get it. ""A Clockwork Orange"" is an exception. On one hand, try as I may, I do not think I can describe such a masterpiece in one or two short paragraphs. On a more personal level, it is truly a movie that makes one think about the things around us."

","The movie is mind blowing; I have seen it a couple of times now and every time is like I am seeing it for the first time. It is like looking in to another parallel dimension but still thinking that psychology of the move somehow can fit in to our world. The character Alex is living for valiance where he find pleasure in others pain, preferably caused by him. I could not find any traits of love in him for anything or anybody, but he does keep a snake as a pet for some reason. Personally I have never been in close relationship with people that are violent or are negatively emotional (tend to make you feel bad). But I am quite sure that nobody is born like that and the only way to really treat it is make sure the child gets a lot of love (in other words make sure it never comes to that). The parents in the move are shown as cold people showing a lot of psychological issues them self. Of course when Alex is cured in the move, deep inside you feel just something is wrong, that is also one of the reasons this movie is so good.."

","""A Clockwork Orange"" is an ingenious film-makers's masterclass. It's a captivating high-speed ultra-horror tour de force, a raw, grisly plunge into violence, in-out sex, rape and murder, a fall into nothingness, there and back again, accompanied by doom a-knocking with the sound of the Funeral Marsh of Queen Mary. There's also lots of Ludwig van in between in a central role, making ""A Clockwork Orange"" one of the best scored pictures of all time. The topic at hand is a sci-fi tale about gruesome violence based on Anthony Burgess' book, which director Stanley Kubrick made too frighteningly real for some, sugared by the film's aestheticism of violence, critics say he thus embellished despicable acts. This forced Kubrick to retract his own movie in the UK in order to prevent copycats from imitating the film - a circumstance, which of course only contributed to its undisputed cult status. ""A Clockwork Orange"" was a risky undertaking, a film that stirred, shocked, repelled or was loved all for the wrong reasons, but there is no way around it any way you look at it.<br/><br/>From the first hundred percent orange screen in movie history, to Malcolm McDowell's first shot revealing him sitting in the Korova Milk Bar with his droogies, to Jesus statues dancing thanks to changing camera angles and quick cuts and ""Singing in the Rain"" - in every little moment of the movie there's no doubt that a master is at work."

","A psychological brainwash that leaves a victim, Alex played by Malcolm McDowell left to fight his personal battles of violence while being conditioned against them. Alex, alongside his group of droogs, create havoc around an English town until he is caught by police and imprisoned for murder. It is there he meets the Minister, acted by Anthony Sharp who puts Alex through psychological conditioning by subjecting him to sickness when shown images of violence and sex. It is this conditioning that leads to his release and ultimately his misery as his ""cure"" is seen as wicked and controversial by the people. After a suicide attempt, Alex ends up in a hospital ward where the effects are reversed and Alex finds himself ""normal"" again. The theme of this film revolves around the psychological boundaries that are questioned when involving human subjects. Alex, although agreeing to such treatment in lieu of jail time, was victim to the conditioning of experimental treatment geared towards removing violent and sexual thought from the mind. What is witnessed, is when presented with choice of violence or sex the subject reverts to conditioning that triggers displeasure. This, in turn limits choice one has to choose the correct path but instead must choose another to avoid pain. The misery that Alex has caused other people in his life, such as rape and violence eventually come back to him. The homeless man that is assaulted in the film's opening scene, finds Alex after his release from treatment and assaults him back. The police officers that break up the assault are non-other than two former droogs themselves, who Alex assaulted and mistreated. They two officers then drive him out in the woods and attempt to drown him. These scenes all play part in the psychological conditioning process as Alex cannot fight back. His attempt to defend himself is met with the urge to vomit, causing him pain. It is the very things that during treatment, ironically causes Alex such anguish. One of these is the repeated music of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. Alex, who is passionate about Beethoven, is conditioned against this song as it was used in the condition process itself. Next, there is the imagery of sex and sexual expression. Scenes of nudity being free and open are repeated along with the repression of it during times of rape and conditioning. It is the fight of choice that ultimately destroys Alex which is constant throughout. If given the choice, you are either seen as good or bad when making it. It is choice and expression which makes us who we are and with this film, you witness the human constraint when it is removed."

","The movie, A Clockwork Orange main theme was how society dealt with the reduction of criminals in futuristic England. This movie was released in 1971.

Alex is the leader of a four member gang. He has to rivals in this gang struggling for power. Dim played by Warren Clarke and Georgie played by James Marcus. As this movie progresses, it breaks down further into two smaller themes. The first one is how Alex is introduced to the new treatment to prevent people from becoming criminals again. The second theme is when the tables are turned on Alex and he becomes the victim by his former victims. As Alex's gang commits more crimes and a conflict with Dim and George begin. After Alex shows his gang who is boss by use of force, his gang set him up to get arrested. Alex and the gang go to the house of the Cabwoman. Alex breaks in and gets into a confrontation with the Catwoman killing her. When Alex exits the house, he his assaulted and left there by his gang members. The police arrive, arrest Alex and imprison him. This sets up the second theme for the experimental treatment he receives so he can be released from a lengthy fourteen year prison sentence of which he only serves two years. After his release from the experimental treatment, the table is turned on him. He arrives at home only to find that his room has been rented out to a stranger by his parents played by Shela Rayner and Philip Stone and his former gang members Dim and Goergie are policeman now. After being beaten up himself by a former homeless man and his associates, the police arrive to break it up. To Alex's astonishment Dim and Geordie, the two who challenged Alex for leadership take their revenge out on him. They drive him to an isolated forest, beat him and try to drown him. Surviving the beating and drowning, Alex staggers back down the muddy road from where they took him only to end up at the house he and his gang members entered to rape Mrs. Alexander played by Adreien Corri and beat her husband up Mr. Alexander played by Patric Magee. Mr. Alexander recognizing Alex from his previous encounter and beating plots his revenge against Alex. A similar movie, Spartacus played Kirk Douglas is also a show item as was Alex when he was being presented to a crowd of curios members of the medical, correctional and media, whereas Spartucus was displayed as an up and coming Gladiator to the Roman officials. Both went through torture of some kind and both had the table turned on them. Self narration was used well in A Clockwork Orange by Alex. He gave insight to his troubled life before and after treatment. The colors used in this film were adequate to show a futuristic state. As in A Space Odyssey 2001, pastel colors were used to give the futuristic effect. Close ups in this movie were adequate but the most revealing close up is when Alex is strapped in the chair with the eye devices and wires hooked up to him while watching the assembly of the Third Riech, he is shown to horrified and the viewer can imagine themselves in that very chair."

It has that excellent Stanley Kubrick look and style, even if I didn't see the director I would have instantly recognised the Kubrick Styles. The characters are great, Warren Clarke was fantastic as Dim, Georgie was also very enjoyable. But of course the character that completely stole the show was Malcolm McDowell as Alex, he is one of the greatest screen villains of all time. However, despite how great the casting, the writing, and the style was, there were a few things that I didn't enjoy. Any rape scene is very disturbing indeed, but I thought they just went way WAY too far with these, also I felt as if some of it was a bit outdated, though thats not really something you can blame.

If you start watching this movie expecting it to be a traditional story with easily understandable events and messages, you will be sorely disappointed. The whole movie,right from the start, exudes one of the strangest feels I have ever gotten from any other movie. Just everything I can think of- the looniness of the characters actions, the soft music that conflicts with the despicable acts taking place on screen, and the accents of the actors. Much of the movie is COMPLETELY inaudible because the actors all have extremely thick British accents, and let me tell you, this drove me nuts. At one point I had to turn the subtitles on so that I could understand what was being said, but then I realized that much of what is being said does not necessarily matter because this film has a deeper meaning about life and society. What exactly that is I will not ruin for you, but understand if you choose to watch this film it is very unorthodox, very different than any film you will probably ever watch.<br/><br/>It is very interesting artistically as the filmmakers use a variety ambient lighting a cool camera effects that really add to the eerie and confusing feel of the film. Overall it was an enjoyable movie, but I only started enjoying when I realized that this was not a typical movie.

The film doesn't glorify or renounce violence, it shows it very matter of factly. Kubrick instead forces you to look at the criminal's role in society, and the ideas of free will, and individual rights versus overall benefit to society. The film starts out very fast and slows down as the story develops. This film takes many strange twists and turns, and although it wasn't something I enjoyed, Kubrick did a wonderful job of telling this strange story, and the movie will stick in your head long after you see it.

"fullen07","Null","0","1","31 October 2011"," A disturbing look into government control
","A Clockwork Orange, directed by Stanley Kubrick based off of Anthony Burgess' 1962 novel of the same name starring Malcolm McDowell as Alex. Alex is a troubled youth living in a futuristic society that has become lack of moral values and rules. Alex lives his life carefree and without regret as the leader of a small group of misfits known as Droogs. The Droogs spend most of their time high on a drugged form of milk (which in the future has become legal and sold in milk bars) as they cruise the night looking to increase their high with ""Ultra- Violets"". These ""Ultra-Violets"" come at the misfortune of others as the gang beats, rapes, and takes anything they want. The theme, or focus, of the film is on the ideas of the truths of human nature as they relate to social problems within society and the governments role in correcting them. In the film the government uses a mind control technique known as the Ludovico Technique to cure Alex of his need for violence and sex. Their goal is to cure him and make him fit into the mold of what they think a citizen should be and act like. The theme of this film reminded me somewhat of George Orwell's 1984. Before Alex is released from prison he undergoes the Ludovico Technique of treatment to cure him of his need for violence and sex. The treatment sessions themselves were just as violent to Alex as the crimes he had been committing before prison. He was drugged and subjected to countless hours of films showing him the most perverse violent acts imaginable, to the point that just the thought of such things made him ill. After Alex is released from prison he tries to fit back into society on the straight and narrow path, but the mind-altering treatments that he had undergone push him to the brink of madness. He is unable to cope with society as he had left it before and eventually tries to take his own life. After Alex's failed suicide he becomes a martyr for the people outraged at the idea of the government using drugs and mind control to change people for the better or worse. The director, Stanley Kubrick, uses several film techniques in this movie to bring its theme to life, two of which really stuck out to me, the use of color and voice over narration. The use of color primarily in the opening and ending scenes that just showed the films credits in front of very bright changing colors. This reminded me of the use of psychedelic drugs such as LSD and how during the time that the movie was being filmed our own government was experimenting with the use of LSD to alter the minds of soldiers to change them and create the perfect soldier, or how the drug was also being used by psychiatrist to alter the minds of patients. So even though the movie was taking place in the future its message reflected what was currently happening in society and the potential side effects from it. Voice over narration was equally important in this film, as it dealt with the inner workings of a character's mind. Without being able to really listen in to what Alex was thinking we could not of understood the depth of who he was before and especially after he underwent the treatments. Overall I highly recommend this film. It was a very entertaining look into society, with all of our difference and ideas of what is right and wrong, and most importantly the moral aspects of big brother using its power to alter what or who we are on the inside."

","A Clockwork Orange is a great movie with a lasting theme for all generations. Before I delve further, I want to point some items out. I am aware of the book, that this book was shortened by a chapter when it was published in the states, and that this movie is based off the shortened book. This is, however, about the movie, not the book.<br/><br/>The basic theme throughout is the subject of choice. Another movie with a similar theme is Spider-Man. This regular guy is given superpowers. He has a choice to make. Does he use these powers for good or evil?<br/><br/>But back to A Clockwork Orange. Alex, played by Malcolm McDowell, and his droogs go out every night causing ""ultra-violent"" activities of assault and rape, to name a few. They have the choice to stay in and not do any violence, yet they choose to go out and do this.<br/><br/>A quick side note about the lighting. This movie was one of the first movies to use all natural lighting. This made the scenes of the droogs at night seems darker, and yet when they were inside the lighting was cheerful and filled the room. The lighting was expertly done to show that life is life no matter what the choice.<br/><br/>A second quick side note about the camera angles. The camera angles were mostly of one main part of making it seem as if observing all these actions through a window. The viewer is not really able to help any of the victims except to just watch what has happened.<br/><br/>After Alex is taken by the police, he then has to serve a prison sentence for his choice. In prison, he hears of this new technique to ""cure"" him of his violent behavior. This technique is a conditioner to help remove his choice of violence by making him sick at the thought of violence. The conditioner also makes him sick whenever he hears Beethoven 9th Symphony.<br/><br/>After this conditioning, Alex is then released back into society. Once released, he comes face to face with the consequences of his choices. One of his choices that he did with his droogs was to gain entrance too and then beat the owners of a home. The man, Mr. Alexander played by Patrick Magee, was crippled and the woman, Mrs. Alexander played by Adrienne Corri, was raped and killed by this. The man then finds out about Alex and attempts to force him to commit suicide.<br/><br/>This results in the government receiving a huge backlash of how the conditioning was wrong. Alex, in the hospital, is ""cured of his cure"" while unconscious. The minister then pays him a visit and proves to the press that he is ""cured of his cure"". Alex then has his own choice back. He can choose to be good. Or he can choose to go back to the life he had."

Yes, scene after scene and scream after scream will disturb you more and more and if you really focus on the movie it will make you think more and more and more. There are many many questions asked about a lot of ethical concerns. What those concerns are you will find out as you watch the movie yourself. But you will not be let out without a feeling in your gut that wont leave you for a few days for sure.<br/><br/>Malcolm McDowell has to carry the whole movie on his shoulders and her does it seamlessly. The weird clothes, the eye liner, that sick accent, the narrating and his antics combined provide a treat to never forget and which none can mimic. Being the sole character who is present throughout the film, he pushes himself to a really really high level of acting where Alex turns out to be a menace to everyone including himself. You can see a vivid range of emotions and character development painstakingly etched onto his face and in his eyes especially in the iconic Ludovico technique scene. The supporting cast all round him does a great job in showing the menace of his character and at times showing how menacing they can be as well.<br/><br/>Much need not be said about Stanley Kubrick. Those who know has work know how good things can get when he gets stuff right. He always gets his stuff right as well. It still bothers me to know that such a great director did not win a directing Oscar. He truly deserved 3 Oscars for the top three honors of film, direction and screenplay. He doesn't hold back on anything and you can never see him pulling punches. He comes flat out and smacks you in your face and you will not a much better smack than this, believe me. <br/><br/>For the beautifully created sets, the director, the sick screenplay, the magnificently menacing Alex and for the down right disturbing amount of brilliance shown I have to give it a 10/10."

","Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange tells the tale of a young hooligan named Alex and his gang of ""droogs"" in future Britain. Alex and his droogs get their daily kicks from fighting, stealing, violating and listening to their favourite composer: Ludwig Van Beethoven. One day the droogs decide they no longer need Alex as their leader, so they formulate a devious scheme to get rid of him once and for all, but not everything goes to plan Kubrick's effective use of music in the film contrasts heavily to the events taking place. Rather than using a slow and moody score to suit the film's content, Kubrick opted to use up-beat and fast paced classical music, which adds quite a comical and sarcastic feel to events that would seem somewhat terrifying in any other circumstance. The eccentric set design and costuming gives a sense of madness throughout, and while it doesn't necessarily look the future, it certainly doesn't look like the present. The performances are all solid, especially that of Malcolm Mcdowell who gives a tour de force performance as the juvenile delinquent Alex Delarge. A Clockwork Orange truly is Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece, and is my absolute favourite film. 10/10"
"sme_no_densetsu","9","0","1","31 July 2011"," Stanley Kubrick turns a great novel into a great movie
","Anthony Burgess's novel ""A Clockwork Orange"" is one of those books whose appeal is largely derived from its ingenious use of language. Accordingly, any visual interpretation stands to lose much of the impact of the original work. However, with a visionary like Stanley Kubrick at the helm, the results can be equally great in a different way.<br/><br/>Kubrick wrote the screenplay himself and he managed to retain enough of the book's unique language to give the film a sense of the novel's style. Burgess wasn't happy that Kubrick omitted the events of the final chapter of his novel but I feel that the movie's ending is more effective. Overall, a challenging adaptation for which Kubrick was rightly rewarded with an Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>As for the direction (also Oscar-nominated), Kubrick delivered a typically outstanding effort. His direction is arguably as dexterous as Burgess's prose. The cinematography is also stunning while the score, which is rife with classical music, is memorable as well.<br/><br/>As far as acting goes, this is Malcolm McDowell's picture. That's not to say that the supporting actors are forgettable (they aren't); he just delivers a towering performance that few could hope to match. The fact that he was denied an Oscar nomination for his work is nothing short of mind-boggling.<br/><br/>Ultimately, ""A Clockwork Orange"" succeeds both as entertainment and as a piece of art. The novel is a tough yardstick to measure up to but Kubrick accomplished the task mainly by remaining true to the source but also by adding a few touches of his own. I highly recommend it as one of the best films of the seventies."

","Plot<br/><br/>'A Clockwork Orange' tells the story of Alex, a dangerous and violent young man who enjoys murder, rape and Beethoven. He and his three droogs wreak havoc in future Britain. Eventually Alex is seized and locked up, he volunteers for the 'Ludovico Technique' a new treatment designed to tackle Britain's worrying crime rates, Alex thinks he is cured and can begin a fresh start, however things begin spiralling out of control and we soon learn that Alex is far from 'free'.<br/><br/>Review<br/><br/>Let me start by saying that 'A Clockwork Orange' is, in my opinion, one of Kubrick's finest works. Based on Anthony Burgess' 1962 novel of the same name, 'A Clockwork Orange' is funny, frightening, shocking, wacky and very intelligent. What I found most stunning about 'A Clockwork Orange' was the way in which it creates its own 'future' if you will, the frequent inclusion of classical music and surrealist art will wonder and amaze. Of all the things you would expect a future Britain not to have, Kubrick's masterpiece has them all, a passion for Ludwig Van Beethoven, explicit sexual and surrealist art, weird and wacky coloured hair of females, and a language that takes elements of Russian and cockney slang and combines them to create something unique.<br/><br/>The main theme of the film is morality, it begs the question 'Is it right to use the Ludovico technique to prevent someone committing crime?' Alex is deprived of free will in the film. After he is released from prison and subject to the Ludovico technique he is unable to make choices thus he has no free will. The chaplain condemns the Ludovico technique and says 'He ceases also to be a creature capable of moral choice'. Alex does not commit crime after the Ludovico technique because he is unable to. He does not choose to be a good person, instead he is programmed to be good and has no moral choices. The treatment degrades Alex as a person, this could be seen as only fair because Alex and his droogs degraded many of their victims. Alex, prior to his arrest has much more than the ability of moral choice, he has the ability of free will in society. He often commits crimes that go without any punishment hence the reason his treatment is only 'fair' he possessed moral choices, miss used them therefore he has had them taken away. This is echoed through the minister's words 'we are only concerned with cutting down crime' clearly moral choices are not important in society. Society is unfair on Alex although he dehumanises his victims, he has had control of his life taken away. It is given back as a means for the government to regain popularity presenting unfair society. Furthermore when the minister uses the arrest of Mr Alexander to defend his totalitarian regime he uses a cover up and says it was for Alex' protection. Additionally the immorality of Alex as a character is reflected in society for example sexual house decoration is common in his parents house, in the moloko milk bar and in the cat lady's house therefore Alex may not be seen responsible for his actions but rather society. <br/><br/>Mcdowell's performance is nothing short of amazing, his role as Alex may frighten audiences but as the film progresses you will probably grow a sense of fondness and sympathy for Alex as a character. Mcdowell fits the part perfectly, he has to play a smart, charismatic but equally dangerous character and he does it so well. As soon as I saw that sinister grin on the face of Alex at the beginning of the film, I knew I was about to witness a special lead performance and I was correct. What struck me most about Mcdowell's performance was how he takes on such a difficult role but makes it look so easy, a character (Alex) who goes from ultra violent youth to government guinea pig who we feel sorry for, this is such a transformation and reform in the main character but Mcdowells transition is stunning and for me, and probably many others his performance will live long in the memory as one of the greatest. <br/><br/>The scenes of violence may distress viewers and shock audiences but they are amazingly directed. I mean the the gang fight scene is superb. Billy Boy being called a 'cheap, globby bottle of stinking chip oil' and the brilliantly entertaining action accompanied by dramatic classical music will have you on the end of your seat. Similarly iconic is the chillingly dark scene in which Alex and his droogs commit rape while Alex sings the lyrics of 'Singin in the rain' those two scenes although controversial are undeniably iconic. <br/><br/>Personally I think Alex is one of the most interesting, entertaining and charismatic characters in the history of film, he serves as both antagonist and protagonist and his interests and enjoyments will both shock and blow the mind of many viewers. Alex as both the vulnerable and the deadly will have you in awe, and the name Alex de Large will never be forgotten by anyone who watches 'A Clockwork Orange' and actually has a decent idea about films.<br/><br/>Summary<br/><br/>'A Clockwork Orange' may not be everyones cup of tea, but Mcdowells performance, the character 'Alex', the amazing and clever inclusions and the iconic scenes have made the film what it is today, a masterpiece. Without a doubt one of Kubrick's finest, and my favourite movie to date. Simply marvellous stuff."

","""A Clockwork Orange"" is hands down, one of the best films I have ever seen. It blew me the away the first time I saw it and then it just started to grow on me, it probably hypnotises you somewhere amongst the sublime, surreal, psychedelic and quite frankly genius film-making. Each time you watch it you gain something new and you find yourself appreciating more of it. This really is what all good films should be about.<br/><br/>The first 40 minutes defines the reason for its banning. It's ultraviolent even for today's standards and also quite unsettling the way such awful acts are being committed with a surreal flair and with such weird humour! The most controversial and famed part obviously being the iconic ""Singin' in the Rain"" whilst raping a woman. You don't know whether to laugh or gasp in shock. In the end you find yourself doing a bit of both! The directing is so alive and full of unusual techniques and it comes together so beautifully and almost perfect.<br/><br/>Kubrick is obviously known for his exceptional films such as ""The Shining"" which is another horror masterpiece I adore. Here I think he gives his best example of directing. The cinematography IS perfect! And there is no doubt about it, right down to the lighting it is just utterly beautiful to look at. The shadows of the four youths in front of the infamous tramp beating is possibly the best example of the genius cinematography. Even the fight scenes seem to be like a ballet and an art-form.<br/><br/>I know that some people will simply not quite ""get"" the weirdness but that's because this sort of thing is new and different. This is an original approach to film-making and makes it what it is. The screenplay is nothing short of genius, even though you can hardly understand it with the futuristic speak like, ""yarbles"" and ""viddy"" yet you know what they're saying! The plot is brilliant, we're liking this truly awful character but because of the great writing and Malcolm Mcdowell's exceptional performance. We get to sort of admire Alex. Malcolm carries such presence and charm to the film, which also makes it what it is! Their is a great contrast between the psychedelic life of committing ultraviolent acts and the stillness of prison-life.<br/><br/>In the end we are given a near-perfect film. It shows a genius direction and writing along with characters who we can care about. This is nothing short of a masterpiece and one of the best films you will see EVER! You might not get it but give it a chance ducks!"

","I first viewed this as a college freshman. Folks Stateside may recall that upon premiere it had received an ""X"" rating from the Motion Picture Association of America. My classmates' response was along the lines of, ""Not only did we read the book, it was assigned reading!"" And though I suffered my share of shock and awe in my first viewing the impression that resonated long after was the occasional sound of the audience laughing...LOUDLY.<br/><br/>Fast forward two score years...it's not grown easier to ""viddy"". The acting in most places is over-the-top, likely on purpose, and though the net effect is somewhat laden in the irony department...well, so's the source novel by Anthony Burgess...and some scenes still place me on the very edge of changing the channel.<br/><br/>Its direction still sears and is ably supported by the production design and camera-work. Not only does Stanley Kubrick know his Ninth, he also knows his Rossini.

","A Clockwork Orange is a futuristic look into life and mind a fifteen-year-old boy named Alex. Alex is a disturbed troubled young man whose appetite for violence leads him down a path of crime and utterly sinful violence. A Clockwork Orange takes place in a pre-futuristic British society Alex play by actor Malcolm McDowell leads a gang of misfit criminals Dim (Warren Clarke), and Georgie (James Marcus). The film is uniquely witty with its British humoristic dialect. This is truly a film of coming of age gone wrong. By the end of the film it left me wandering if Alex learned anything from his experiences or were the experience that Alex goes through meant to reach the audience in hope that they learn from Alex. A brilliant colorful take on adolescence and violence I really enjoyed the film."
"gocc1825","10","0","2","8 June 2011"," Society and the Individual, on the silver screen
","Another gem from Kubrick. I'm not going to blow smoke up his skirt about how good the film is because it's a tried and true classic. Instead I am going to refute those reviewers who say the movie is about ""getting away with ""pure evil"" or trying to destroy poor morals. This is not what the movie is about.<br/><br/>What is really done is an in depth look at morality on the individual level. Alex is a ""godless"" individual who creates his own morality and ethical code in a relativistic and Nietzschean manner. This means hedonism and self-gratification to him, but society sees him as a menace and a violator of the social contract. <br/><br/>Alex is taken under the arm of the state and therefore is subject to the totalitarian, theocratic objectivism that they promote and enforce with an iron fist. Christianity, the driving moral force behind the states ethical code, is forced upon Alex. This mean's to ""be crucified instead of crucifying,"" as the prison father most poignantly puts it. <br/><br/>This black and white type of thinking is anachronistic and dead in the eyes of postmodernist like Kubrick, taking Nietzsche's ideas and putting them into practice here. We see the absolute disgust at the state's approach to morality in Alex, who, like Nietzsche's Zarathustra, suffers nausea when unable to live by his own morals. The state shoves objective Christian morality down his throat and all he can do is gag. <br/><br/>That is the brilliance of this film. It is an introspective epic into the dangers of objective Christian morality. <br/><br/>God is Dead. We must dance and become burning stars."
"jzappa","9","0","1","4 June 2011"," The Psychosomatic Associations of Music
","It's all been said about A Clockwork Orange, I think. From McDowell's eerie iconic performance to the controversy over its supposedly ""pornographic"" violence to its satirical portrayal of governmental and civic abuse of liberty, this utterly genre-less work of sublimity remains one of those mystifying pinwheels of the cinema. Kubrick's painterly, insoluble kaleidoscope is most often explained as political satire, or dystopian sci-fi, or a crime drama, while its intersecting allure to the horror fan community is clearly pervasive. Though I don't pretend to entirely understand this film, I nevertheless find it profound and unique, especially in its loaded portrayal of the psychosomatic associations we make with music, or that music makes with us. A crucial musical instant in Kubrick's inspired carrying out of Anthony Burgess' inventive story comes when Alex bursts into song in the bath.<br/><br/>He's just been beaten and almost killed by his former ""droogs"" who've been rehabilitated as policemen by manipulative judicial rule, looking to safeguard its society even if it has to confine them to do so. In desperate search of a home, Alex has unconsciously meandered in from a rainstorm only to realize he is back at the place of one of his ""ultra-violent"" crimeswith a doorbell whose chord tone is the opening bar of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. Here, years before, he and his milk-guzzling goons disabled a radical writer, Patrick Magee in enjoyably frenzied form, and raped his wife throughout a standard night on the town. Magee's eyes exceptionally gush excruciating sonorities and a full to bursting house boy whose sculpted physique and size guarantee that the master's safety will never again be disturbed.<br/><br/>The cold-blooded delinquent's initial anxiety at being recognized by his now wheelchair-bound host swiftly scatters as Alex remembers he wore a Pinocchio-penis mask, craftily supplementing the brimming jock ensemble of the hooligans' costumes, throughout the real-life nightmare. More substantiation of his obscurity is discovered in the day's paper where the freshly sprung ""reformed"" criminal's mug gilds the headlines, proclaimed as a mammoth triumph for the government's crime layout. But the warm, foamy water unwinds the liberated fluke, who feels so at ease that he thrashes out one or two choruses of Singin' in the Rain: Trouble is, that was the jingle he felt unencumbered enough to bawl while having his ""in-out"" with Magee's voluptuous wife. Hearing the same crooner who reduced his life to rubble sets the author off to extract a musical vengeance: Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.<br/><br/>To make Alex not dangerous to recommence his life in the social order, and preclude the government thousands in prison costs, he's barraged with gruesome imagery of violent promiscuous sex, brutal beatings and genocide until any inkling of these appalling ways causes a bodily nausea of vomit-inducing magnitude. Played relentlessly throughout this total indoctrination, Beethoven's most illustrious, celebrated and astounding conception, a personal beloved of the classical-music enthusiast whose ménage à trois with a pair of lascivious girls from a record shop scored by Rossini's 1812 Overture remains the most feverish intercourse in cinema. Inadvertently, the born-again peacekeeper has the same stomach-turning response whenever the Ode to Joy is heard. Kubrick uses the music in a remarkably accomplished way. In the early moments, we hear Ferenc Fricsay's 1958 recording with a barefaced product placement predicting the imminent social evil of fusing business and art, but when in the hospital, the music is as synthetic as his mind-blowing rehabilitation. But using the chic simulation has import on various planes: The reproduction just cannot substitute the real thing.<br/><br/>The closest I've come to a firm grasp of the film as a whole, in terms of its production and costume design, is the notion that whatever society we would actually see in our future, unlike most futuristic films, really would be something to which we'd be stumped on how to react. Like this film's period-combining architecture and unthinkable use of color and decor, it would be hypnotic to experience, somewhat different the more we return to it and very off-putting and even at times uncomfortable in its expression of sexuality. But somehow, although the film is now 40 years old, we may not be far from a point at which all desire and interest as derived from our sex instinct, plays the primary part in all human activity, mental and physical, from violence to dress sense to hang-outs decorated entirely by nude mannequins that dispense milk from their genitalia to a teacher showing up at Alex's house, laying on the bed with him and grabbing his groin. It's a world that seems contradictory in those ways to mainstream society, especially in America, where we're still very uptight about sexuality outside of hetero gender-role normatives, but leave it to the visionary who brought 2001 to the screen to envisage a society devoid of many conventional inhibitions, in a story about inhibitions."

"drmichaelrjames","9","0","1","21 May 2011"," Still shocking after all these years.
","The world or this site doesn't really need another review of this film. However after reading maybe 30 or more reviews here I have noticed two things which need a comment (skip to bottom). But I also just watched the video interviews (by the Guardian newspaper) in which Malcolm McDowell, Jan Harlan and Christiane Kubrick discuss the remastered 40th anniversary edition of Stanley Kubrick's dystopian masterpiece, screening at the Cannes film festival (May, 2011).<br/><br/>I saw the movie when it was first released and still remember the feeling of shock. It does traumatize you. But, as most reviews here agree, in no way does it glorify this kind of urban violence. Every gen-Y, Z should be forced to watch this when they hit 15, as a prophylactic against such senseless violence. <br/><br/>I have had the DVD since it first came out, but must admit I haven't watched it for ages and am not sure I want to. Yet, I give it 9 stars! How can such a great movie be one you don't want to watch? But it is true, as so many reviews here testify.<br/><br/>Anyway the things I did not find in other reviews: Kubrick is a master but Anthony Burgess deserves almost equal credit. I had read his 1962 book of the same name before I saw the movie. (Same year as movie of To Kill a Mocking Bird, one year after Catch 22 publication and one year before Pynchon's first book, V; whew!) Like the movie, it probably should not have worked. it uses an invented argot called Nadsat (a mix of Russian and English) which makes it tough going--and would normally make me stop reading. But it is brilliant and is simply one of those inexplicable works of art. (Read it; the other astounding thing, given its impact, is that it is just a novella that can be read in almost one sitting.) One understands why Kubrick wanted to make it into a film as soon as he read it. It was hard to imagine it being filmable but equally impossible to imagine anyone else filming it. <br/><br/>Second thing is that several reviews here falsely state that the film was banned in the UK. No, it was Kubrick who took it out of circulation after about 12 months because it was hugely controversial. He and his family were besieged by nutters at their house near London, and by endless telephone crank calls. Burgess also thought the film ""so brilliant that it might be dangerous"". It is true the police and government were pretty unhappy with the much speculated copy-catting by youth. It is arguable whether that was true but Burgess was amazingly ahead of his time though no doubt partly inspired by the Mod gang wars happening in the late 50s early 60s when he was writing it. Parts of the film look like they could be something out of 80s or 90s modern culture (eg. Tarantino).<br/><br/>So, an astounding film based on an astounding book."

Well, I don't want to give any of it away, so I'll just tell you that on the exterior of the film, it follows a rather simple storyline.

I figure, it might help me find an even deeper meaning in the story, why not? Let me tell you, the book, which is written by Anthony Burgess, is one of the toughest reads I've ever had. Not because is was disorganized, inept, or illogical. It wasn't. It's because of how it's written entirely in first person, as it should be, and the bizarre dialect which the narrator speaks in, which is English with Russian and other terms you won't find in any dictionary. If you haven't seen the film before reading the novel, I can't possibly see how you could understand, or merely comprehend, any of it. How Stanley Kubrick, one of the greatest filmmakers to ever walk the earth, took this very complex novel made up of what I can only explain as poetic gibberish and make such a clear and focused movie that stands the test of time as one of the greatest moments in film history only leaves me to respect the man even more.<br/><br/>(And in no way am I bashing the Burgess novel, which deserves to be in a class of its own based on the original and audacity that author had in crafting a beautiful collage of words and thought.)"

","A CLOCKWORK ORANGE was made by Stanley Kubrick in England during1970/71. It debuted in the USA in December 1971 and in Britain the following month. After over a year on release, it was eventually withdrawn from UK distribution by Kubrick and was never re-issued or shown on TV or released on video.<br/><br/>Not until March 2000 did A CLOCKWORK ORANGE reappear on British screens (following Kubrick's death), released from it's cinematic exile and glowing in bright colours as good as it had been in 1971. However, the film's futuristic vision nowadays resembles an alternative version of the 1970s (something British viewers of a certain age will recognise). It's a very British grimness with it's drab flats, ugly prisons and concrete housing estates.<br/><br/>The film's depiction of sex and violence seems restrained compared to those other two notorious British films of 1971 - THE DEVILS and GET CARTER. In fact, there is only one on screen death and that's committed by Malcolm Macdowell as Alex wearing a large rubber nose, a bowler hat, a white boiler suit and a cod piece (his murder weapon is a giant penis sculpture).<br/><br/>The look and sound of this film never diminish, with its claustrophobic interiors and a startling use of music: listen to Purcell's Music for the Funeral of Queen Mary over the titles or Rossini's Thieving Magpie used to accompany a night of gang fights and joy riding. <br/><br/>The film is set in a London terrorised by hooligans like the surprisingly articulate Alex and his idiot droogs. The opening half hour comprises of the beating up of a tramp, a gang fight, a joy ride, a burglary and a rape. When Alex later gets his comeuppance for murder, the route out of prison is a new form of aversion therapy advocated by the Home Secretary (Anthony Sharp, every inch the suave upper class 1970s Tory). With his eyes prized open Alex is forced to watch endless sex and violence on screen, having being injected so that he feels nauseous and near to death whenever the impulse to sex and violence kicks in. In the end, his 'cure' is a reversion to a helpless state which means on the outside he becomes a victim of the various people he has wronged.<br/><br/>But the films concludes with Alex being readjusted back to his normal state, a moment brilliantly realised with Beethoven's Ninth on the soundtrack and a fantasy of Alex having sex in public: ""I was cured alright"" he says. Cue Gene Kelly's 'Singing in the Rain'.<br/><br/>Today, the other thing which will distress a viewer is Patrick Magee's very bad acting but you'll be exhilarated on so many levels. It's a film far from everyone's taste and I'm not altogether how seriously we're meant to take it."

But with A Clockwork Orange, now arguably Kubrick's greatest, in contrast to FMJ, 2001, The Shining and EWS, the film has lifted not just from last weeks, but from his own hands.<br/><br/>Though initially sceptical of Kubrick's 'gift' having started with his least tremendous, Eyes Wide Shut, which was no dastardly Friedberg and Seltzer combination, but to an outsider breaching the circle of meticulousness and cinematic genius, wasn't the most forthcoming or prestigious of his films. But a distasteful (back then) introduction has lead to what is now, pure admiration. A Clockwork Orange continues his stainless visage, incorporating the aid of classic music which has ironically never been more suited to something so contradictory yet complimentary.<br/><br/>As far as controversy goes (and these days it's, pretty, pretty far) Clockwork has tremendously surpassed all graphic expectations with flying screams and violence. But with Kubrick, the quantity never ranked below the quality; true its explicit characters, story and content can have you lunging for the nearest available sick bag, and the profanity seems scarcely mild compared to the fiery zest that sexual violence stings you with, but all the text book requirements are dutifully ticked along the way so there's no doubt of any excessive violence just for the sake of it in Kubrick's safe hands.<br/><br/>Within these requirements are: the captivating characters – Malcolm McDowell sadly overlooked in his youth for making the Tyler Durden-ish teenager, a heart heaving tragic case. Rich black comedy – when you delve deep into your own shame, such as the attack of the giant genital ornament. Contrapuntal sound – ""I'm singing in the rain"" Whack. Slap. Kick. ""Just singing in the rain"" Scissors. Forced clothes removal. Guess the rest. If that was unearthed to be a shocking statement, that's not a loose thread on Clockwork's jacket. Then the most important component: a blend of all these.<br/><br/>It's reassuring that Kubrick didn't take the fake route of not including the inhumanity when doing the screenplay. It makes the film so harrowing, so real, so perfect. If he took the adult friendly (it's too extreme to be tarred down to teenage friendly) route of showing us a wall to conceal the excessive (but necessary) blood spilling and clothe dispensing, how else would you expect to learn about the character? If it was all tucked away and hidden from audiences, would it have acquired its deserving cult status? Unlikely, or its cinematic recognition – e.g. the fast-mo 'Inny Outy' threesome is probably the best sex scene to ever be put on screen (only Kubrick could make you say that about a film).<br/><br/>When fellow Brit-film Peeping Tom caused a stir it actually ended the director's career despite being a misjudged masterpiece. It makes you shiver at the thought if that had happened to Kubrick, but at least it would have terminated his career with his biggest and best bang."

","A masterpiece despite having some very disturbing parts. Stanley Kubrick(2001: A Space Odyssey, The Shining, Full Metal Jacket, Eyes Wide Shut) brings to life Anthony Burgess's dystopian novel in which a teenage boy named Alex and his gang go around terrrorizing(assault, rape) innocent people for fun. Alex is caught after an accidental murder and sent to prison and is put through a rehabilitation program which makes him sick whenever he has thoughts of violence and sex. There were times when I cringed and turned away. The rape scenes made me want to vomit, but most of the disturbing parts take place within the first hour. After that the rest of the movie isn't that bad. What surprised me about the movie is it's underlying tone of comedy. There are a few parts that are actually really funny. The acting is top notch especially Malcolm McDowell. His character, Alex has to be one of the scariest main character/villains of all time. After seeing what he does you kind of want to see him pay the price for his actions. While I was watching the movie Alex reminded me of Eric Cartman from South Park. Cartman was definitely modeled after Alex. All in all it's a fantastic movie but I would advise that you fast forward through the disturbing parts."

","Clockwork Orange stands firmly between two genres. On the top, it is very much a shock movie, a fine example of exploitation cinema.<br/><br/>However, when we consider the film in another way, as a drama that uses shock as it's driving force, we might realise that there is more to this story than what had first disgusted us.<br/><br/>Alex is what you could quite certainly call an anti-hero. His interests are certainly on the wrong side of most people's ethics. He likes to spend his time raping, fighting and gang-banging his way through life. However, we have to wonder, is he truly evil? Even Alex himself has limits, and when he is forced to breach those limits, a change happens in him. <br/><br/>Suddenly he is betrayed by his friends. Finding himself in a whole world of trouble, his character is literally tested. What we witness in the ensuing time raises a very poignant question; is it right to force a person to be ""good""?<br/><br/>If we take away free will, what else do we take with it? Surely a person without free will is not a good person, but a good THING, a thing that works to our perception of goodness, a clockwork orange. We can program a machine to suit our needs, but can we program a human being in the same way?<br/><br/>As evil as we perceive Alex to be, who is more evil? Alex, or the system which takes his free will as punishment for his actions? When we take away the very things that make us human, do we create a monster, or a machine?<br/><br/>And is it better that some people live their lives as such? Maybe yes, maybe no, but the ultimate question is; does the punishment fit the crime?<br/><br/>That's for you to decide."

","This film has been known for the controversy it has caused back in 1971. This film was very disturbing with the brutal violence, rape and murder and the revenge. Stanley Kubrick's classic A clockwork Orange had it all. While watching this movie you will encounter shock, amazement or absolute disgust. The story is about good vs. evil. Malcolm McDowell gives a wonderful performance as Alex de Large. Alex is just an evil character that you are unsure of what will happen to him next. Alex is the leader of an Britain Gang, where violence is a way of life. When Alex is finally captured he receives a prison sentence for 14 years. While in prison he volunteers to become a science experiment that the government sponsored called ""The Ludovico Technique"". The inject him with an experimental drug and then bound in a straight jacket , fasted to a seat with his eyes pried open with some kind of contraption that will make you shudder. He is then placed in a movie theater. Where they force him to watch violent films. These films range from rape to the Nazi. All while watching these films he is listening to Symphony No.9. The experimental drug makes Alex sick while watching these life- like violent films. Whenever confronted with the feelings of lust or violence, he feels nauseous. This feeling prevents him from acting on the violent feelings he previous felt. Once he finishes the treatment he is released into the world. This new world is all new to him. He is now defenseless to all of those who he once took advantage of before. Now they are about to revenge and take advantage of him. He comes into contact with several people who he once mistreated. The camera work and the photography is done exceptionally well, Stanley Kubrick has a way to make his vision very vivid. The soundtrack is a classical music, which makes it stand out from the rest. You must have an open mind while watching A Clockwork Orange otherwise you may not make it through all the violence."
"Red_Identity","Null","0","1","20 February 2010"," Thought-provoking and Unique!
","I very much anticipated A Clockwork Orange. I consider Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey to be the best film ever made, and the only Kubrick film I have seen until now. A Clockwork Orange is a brilliant and very unusual work of film-making. I am sure many people, and critics, still dismiss it to this day of some sort of nasty piece of work, especially when taken out of context and because many will think Kubrick is trying to make us emphasize with Alex and his violent acts because of the different music, especially the ending titles. One can argue that the ending credits' ""Singing In The Rain's"" cheery tone is meant to make us feel happy for Alex's transformation back to the way he was. It is true that A Clockwork Orange is a piece of futuristic fiction but also true that Kubrick tries to clear out it's themes in a satirical way. It even does not feel futuristic at all when thought about because it's presentation of ultra-violence can be seen in the present, even today. It is a meditation on society, and even nearly 40 years later that is still clear when I watched it. It is clear because of the dark comedic aspects of the film. <br/><br/>A Clockwork Orange's themes are horrifying, because it then seems to first ask, then answer, the question about whether our basic human instincts, whether violent or not, should be respected and not tampered with instead of clarifying them to make a simple, clean solution. I have heard from many people, mostly young, that they love this film because they think it is 'cool'. Of course, the violence and the way scenes are filmed will surely please many audiences who really are not sure what to make of a film like this that, if done differently, would not satisfy them. It is all about style for some, and about what a film holds, but not about what a film means. If this is the case, then it would certainly be better if these people simply did not like this film and called it 'boring' or 'confusing', words that are given to many classics today. The film is taken out of context into something that is almost like abusing it's maturity, which can be seen in the actual film itself. <br/><br/>A Clockwork Orange is truly a genius film. I can already foreshadow the time that I will set a date to rewatch it, since like 2001, it is a film that requires multiple viewings. The film is in itself a very disorienting and, clearly, risky film."

","Alex (McDowell) and his gang run the streets at night but when he backfires on his friend they set him up, leading to his imprisonment and a shock scientific experiment.<br/><br/>Having enjoyed 2001: a space odyssey and eyes wide shut, I decided to give this a try, and Kubrick's unusual original conceptual nature is present here as we dive once more into an isolated character, in an isolated state of psyche.<br/><br/>Malcolm McDowell stars as Alex DeLarge, a man who lives for the night, hanging out with his posse of adrenaline packed cronies who beat up old folks, drink milk and occasionally attack and rape innocent people.<br/><br/>Perhaps in today's modern society that violent agenda in a young man isn't too shocking, especially when viewing films such as Kidulthood or watching Skins. But almost 40 years on from this film's initial release and ideologies such as rape, bullying and peer pressure are more in use in teenage social stance than ever.<br/><br/>Not that any of these concepts have any hindrance on the picture's entertainment value oh no. The unusual brutal nature of a clockwork orange's central character strengthens the plots ideal to develop a story upon violence, rage and personal injury. The opening shots of Alex and co in the bar drinking milk is a wonderful mislead that shows Kubrick technically perfect. The semiotics as something as harmless as sitting with a glass of milk is given a shake up through the narration and following montage of violence against a singing old drunkard that manifests itself as the plot soldiers on.<br/><br/>Violence, a key attribute in crime films these days, has certainly developed. Tarantino a key director and writer who has stabbed a nail into the coffin of rules and regulations has certainly taken notes from Kubrick. Here the violent point of view shots and expressions into the camera are echoing pulp fiction, the no nonsense verbal communication through vile discourse is excruciatingly plain.<br/><br/>The plot for this picture, whilst revolving around such strong crime and drama issues such as rape, drugs, violence, family and friends, maintains a slow moving prospect. There is never an inclination as to where the plot is heading, which makes it enjoyably enticing. Kubrick once more uses an isolated central character that proves to be a smashing ideal as through McDowell's rather insane thinker, we see and listen to the world through his eyes and be captivated by his motives, his joy and his misery.<br/><br/>The narration is by far one of the best you will ever hear in any film I can guarantee that. We see an insight into the character's mind and his rather unusual adaptation of British thinking. A worthy mention of the soundtrack as unsurprisingly it is brilliant and has an avid part to play, as does the encoding of manipulation and true colours of the crime and punishment script that have rather fittingly gone down in history as thought provoking and very memorable."

","A masterclass in stylization and aestheticism, this is a typically Kubrickian film boosted with all the quirkiness which the director is famous for, but as a diatribe upon the notional context of individuality-authority-society it doesn't really go anywhere further than the hero's bleak vision, no matter what its fans and so-called intellectuals claim for it. Subsequently, the film narrates its intriguing tale with a virtuoso display of bizarre imagery and unconventional soundtrack, encompassing -along with everything else- its skepticism on individual freedom. In all, this is an irresistible and essential viewing, but one should not dwell too much on its 'deeper' meanings."
"andy-rocker","9","0","1","28 July 2009"," Controversial, eye opening movie splendour.
","Lots of people have posted comments on this film but i feel in necessary to add my own opinion. Firstly this film seems to produce very contrasting opinion depending mostly on movie taste. I see some have given it 1 star due to ""lack of meaning"" i feel that this movie is completely the opposite to a film devoid of all meaning. It is drenched in meaning, some obvious, some more visible if you delve deeper into the sub context of the film. The film basically follows Alex in his life and the way society has rejected him so it seems he has rejected society. In fact it could be either way round but this doesn't matter it is the fact that this futuristic setting mirrors some of the qualities in today's society. The main thing that stopped me from giving this 10 stars was the fact that the futuristic setting is a bit implausible, with some of the qualities from the 70's being directly mirrored onto the film. Some elements are accurate however and i see how it is impossible for him (Stanley and the author of the book) to produce an entirely realistic futuristic setting especially to a viewer watching it after its release. now as far as the cinematography is concerned it is probably among the most perfect ones ever. The music/soundtrack is perfect also as the cultured nature of Alex perhaps builds some sub conscious sympathy before the treatment, otherwise we would think he deserves what he gets given. Overall this film is very graphic but then its Kubrick's realism(maybe in odd circumstances) that defines him as one of the greatest directors of all time. It is also the individual elements of this film that are near perfect or perfect and their cohesion that makes this film a film you have to see at least once. I'm not saying you'll definitely enjoy it but chances are you'll get something out of this if not everything you want in a film i certainly did. It's a film you'll want to watch over and over if you just even slightly enjoyed it first time round, it only gets better."

","I am a Stan fan, just putting it out there first. From ""A Clockwork Orange"" to ""Full Metal Jacket"" and ""The Shining"" and so on. So forgive me if I embellish on Mr. Kubrick's past works. This is not just Kubrick's best work, but also the greatest film ever made. This film works and does well on so many levels. Upon my first viewing, ""I said to myself 'this is all-right' not too good and not too bad. My next viewing I had seen many things that I had not noticed before."" The day after the second viewing, I went out and bought it and it was worth every penny.<br/><br/>The primary goal of the film, I believe, was to show futile our efforts are to change people because of the way they ""tick."" I learned from this films that people don't ""really"" change. The films embraces these thoughts with dark humor and disturbing actions. In one word the film is: SATIRICAL. On another level, the words to describe the film are: ""THE TIMES ARE A-CHANGIN."" These wise words of Bob Dylan apply to this film as well as others and are every bit true in real life, like ""No Country for Old Men."" For example, as a slight spoiler, Alex, towards the beginning of the film; Alex is shown to not wanting things to change like his ""droogie"" Georgie had briefly mentioned. This and the poorly-sought ambition to change certain characters in the film WITHOUT any side effects are both inevitable and the central ideas in the film. A few characters had mentioned how they wished things were still the same in terms of anything, like in terms of Alex's punishments for his crimes. When Alex changes his ways, the others become hypocrites and oppose to what they once believed. For example, the people wanting to change Alex in a non-violent way find that at the end of the film, this is utterly impossible. Certain conversations between characters symbolize a world's readiness to change from one belief to the next and then back again, hence the title which also applies to Alex himself. In the film, half of the characters started as being the ""ultra-violent"" and wanting a change in their ways or vice-versa (good people becoming violent). I'm going to leave it at that because I am getting overwhelmed with just how much this film covers.<br/><br/>I cannot even fully write out how deep this movie is. For those who haven't seen it, go rent it now if you are not easily disturbed. The film was robbed of several deserving Oscars including some I thought the film also should have gotten, but didn't even get an Oscar nod (ex. Best Original Score). The only film that I believe comes close to this masterpiece is Eastwood's ""Unforgiven"" Once again, in a nutshell, go see this, but is not obviously not recommended for kids to watch."
"peqdavid5","10","0","2","13 June 2009"," Another classic provided by Master Kubrick
","I'm pretty sure that everyone remembers the looks on your faces the first time yo watched this film. Like me, millions and millions of people were shivering, with shaky hands and had Beethoven's ninth symphony on their heads for weeks after leaving their nearest cinema or after watching it on VHS or DVD for the first time ever. ""A Clockwork Orange"" is a movie that will remain on your memory during your entire life, not only for the film's brutal violence scenes, but for the entire social criticism. I mean, few films or few directors know how to transmit their messages like ""Clockwork.."" or dear old Stanley. Even a 12 year old (it is not recommendable though, unless you want a traumatized boy for the rest of his life) can understand the big picture of the film: the alarming fact that the society has become a hostile, violent ecosystem based on drugs, alcohol, popular music and sex. It is such a shame that most of the films of the 21st Century are based on these facts. And sometimes I must admit that I was afraid of Kubrick at sometime because in two of his films: ""2001"" and ""Clockwork"" had very accurate predictions about the not so far future. For example: in 2001, Clarke and Kubrick said that in the 21st century man kind would live in outer space and explore the entire Solar System. Also they described a very intelligent, autonomous computer with its very own feelings. Just think about it: we have the technology (I bet Apple and Microsoft already have their versions of HAL-9000 in development), what we need is the money and the motivation to do it. ""Clockwork"" is even more accurate about this century: hijacks, terrorism, 9/11, drug-dealers in every street of Mexico, Colombia and Central America... it's all there. Well, anyways, I loved the film. Highly recommendable (for all those who are mentally apt to watch it)."

","What can I say? From watching most of Stanley Kubrick's films, this is probably the best film of his that shows what a creative mind he has.

It has quite a dark and crimson side to the film. From showing the gang violence, to Beethoven, this motion picture will make you watch this a couple more times to fully understand and enjoy it all over again.<br/><br/>What I love a lot about the film is of course the soundtrack. My favorite piece is the ""9th Symphony, 4th Movement"" by Wendy Carlos, that has a keyboard theme and is so brilliant.<br/><br/>Kubrick deserves a lot of respect in film making.

The acting is superb, most notably by McDowell, the story never stalls and travels from event to event in a good pace.<br/><br/>It's a movie that you have to be open to though. I can imagine not everyone can get quite used to the intelligence shown by McDowell both in his dialogue and taste (Beethoven??) combined with the stupidity of his actions. Not your average delinquent is he? Right up to the end I can never quite work out whether he is taking the system for a ride, or is happily letting the system take him for a ride, which would be quite atypical of someone of his intelligence. The final conversation between Alex and the minister therefore doesn't sit well with me, and leaves me feeling like there was a point that I haven't quite caught.<br/><br/>Anyway, the movie is all about its style and directing. Psychedelic, noisy and feverish, it's an attack on all the senses and a real treat to watch, like wandering around in a giant sweety-shop. Best to see when in bed with the flu... no really."

","If there ever was a film that was shocking and twisted, yet so important and unique in cinema, that would be A Clockwork Orange. Stanley Kubrick, having just come off the success of 2001: A Space Odyssey, continued the most creative vein of his career with this adaptation of Anthony Burgess' controversial novel about gangs of young boys wrecking havoc amongst the streets of futuristic Britain.<br/><br/>This film is so much more than just a look at the future of youth. Kubrick also is able to insert his brilliant visual style which works so well here with the subject material. For the first half hour, we are stunned, amazed at the vicious and cruel acts of Alex and his droogs. As the story moves on, under any other director the story would have become less titillating, but thanks to Kubrick's vision and a tour de force performance by Malcolm McDowell, this movie only gets better. We follow Alex through all aspects of his journey, and this is the key. By the final third, we find ourselves somewhat sympathetic for Alex despite his previous wrongdoings. Beyond this, there is also exploring the fact of whether state control is good or how much it takes until someone is devoid of their basic choice as a human being.<br/><br/>Still, all these nuances aside, this is one movie not easily forgotten. With terrific performances, magnificent backing music, and flawless directing from one of the greatest of all time, A Clockwork Orange is a film to experience and think about for years to come."

","Despite the fact that this movie came out over 30 years ago it still manages to impact its audiences. If a film has the ability to impact an audience beyond its time there is no doubt that something must be good about his film to be able to relate to so many various generations. In an era where teen and college rebellions were at their peak this film takes that concept and builds its plot around this concept. While at its peak in the 1970s teen rebellion will happen in every generation, which helps allow future generations to identify themselves with Alex.<br/><br/>Once thing to take into consideration when looking at A Clockwork Orange is that this film was based off a book. Because of this there is the inevitable question of which is better. However, in this case it does not matter if you read the book because the film is spectacular enough on its own.<br/><br/>It is amazing how this film can take songs as Beethoven's 5th symphony and ""Sing in the Rain"" and turning them into the most disturbing things you will ever hear. By placing these innocent songs with a controversial visual makes the songs and scenes that much more disturbing. <br/><br/>Malcolm McDowell's performance as Alex is captivating by taking a character with villain attributes and turning him into someone that the audience can relate to and sympathize with. Not only is McDowell's performance captivating, but also so is the make-up and costumes. Each gang has their signature outfit that would seem out of place even in the film. Showing that these gangs are even more outside of the society's norms.<br/><br/>A Clockwork Orange remains a must see film even past the time it came out. Allowing current audiences to enjoy the social exploration that this movie conveys.

Their hair colors are bright greens, reds, oranges and blues making it obvious that the character himself has a great mind of imagination.<br/><br/>What is fascinating about this movie is its view on crime.

","Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of Anthony Burgess's novel received the New York Film Critics award for the best film of 1971. It was acclaimed as much for its aesthetic qualities as for the moral questions that it raised. Kubrick incorporated music from various classical compositions at critical moments in the film to highlight the tensions and ambiguities that he wanted to illustrate. He used the music of Rossini and Beethoven (which inspire Alex's dreams of mayhem and destruction) as a background to the senseless violence that Alex and his friends commit. When Alex and his clique fight a rival gang, the violence of both groups is given a perverse beauty through stylish choreography and music from Rossini's ""Thieving Magpie."" Consequently, the audience is torn between the viciousness of the fight and the beauty of its visualization, experiencing a sense of uncertainty and ambiguity. This is intentional on Kubrick's part; it is his attempt to estrange the audience from the victims of the encounters. Perhaps he is using this tension to illustrate the variety and contradictions of human nature. While society may condemn acts of violence, there is, nevertheless, an innately aggressive aspect of human nature. Kubrick's use of music, therefore, retrieves this tendency from the audience's unconscious, thereby causing moral uncertainty.<br/><br/>Thus, we don't know whether to sing along with Alex to the music of ""Singing' in the Rain,"" kicking our feet in time with his, or to be repelled by his brutality. Kubrick even has the kindness to remind us of our uncertainty at the end, leaving ""Singing' in the Rain"" resonating in our ears and forcing us to choose between memories of the fleet-footed Gene Kelly dancing across of Alex's cruel feet stomping his victim. Interestingly, Kubrick plays with our attitude toward Alex in a similar way. First he incites our contempt as we witness Alex's relentless cruelty; then our sympathy as he is betrayed and spiritually crucified; and finally our uncertainty as he rises again. We can detest his adoration of ultra violence, yet the undeniable charm of his Elizabethan dialect and his love of ""Ludwig van"" prevent us from rejecting him completely. Alex is, paradoxically, a cultured barbarian, which is, perhaps, what Kubrick is accusing us all of being. The film exudes aesthetic appeal. As one critic wrote, ""Mr. Kubrick constantly uses a wide-angle lens to distort space relationships within scenes,"" contending that the director intends to separate people and images from the environment and emphasize their distinctions (Canby 193). Kubrick creates a dreamlike atmosphere from the start. First, we are greeted by the face of Alex (one eye ringed with fake lashes); then we take in his environment. Kubrick may have used this surreal technique to represent the drug- induced vision of Alex and his gang when they are at the milk bar. Kubrick reverts to a realistic style when they are not high; for example, during the day or when Alex is sent to prison.<br/><br/>On the surface, the film is futuristic, but, in truth, it is a critique of contemporary society. The clothes and the setting have a futuristic look, but Kubrick refuses to comfort the audience by implying that the events are in the distant future. Alex's final line, ""I was cured, all right!"" mocks the therapy that society prescribed for him. Alex has returned to his old self with the help of the very people who tried to destroy his soul and his freedom of choice. It is an ironic redemption for Alex, who has risen, fallen, and risen again in a world that is no less sick than he is. Consequently, it is impossible for such a society to offer Alex any salvation. Therefore, when he once again dreams of rape and violence to the music of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, we accept the fact that he is back to ""normal."" Quite simply, it was sure to expect that the cause of his condition-society-could also be his cure."

","You know, maybe it's high time I reevaluated A Clockwork Orange. I had been disgusted by it the first time, but I'll admit it left an imprint, one which I have been unable to shake in the years since I first saw it.<br/><br/>It's a disturbed piece of schlock cinema -- or it seemed that way. As I learn to understand Kubrick's artistic excesses and egoistic, exploitative enterprises, I begin to see the wild-eyed genius of his vision.<br/><br/>And I appreciate the disengagement of himself from his camera: in a way similar to Scorsese, Kubrick lets the camera record without ever questioning the validity of what is happening; their difference lies in that Scorsese's films are literate and rootsy, while Kubrick transcends those qualities and adds a hyper-surrealistic sublimity and a heightened tone of heavy ideology.<br/><br/>Kubrick attempts to deconstruct your world and rebuild it, much like Alex Proyas did in his 1998 masterpiece Dark City. He blends the old and conventional with restless ideas that long to jump from the screen but remain staid at his dictatorial hand. His ideas are Orwellian, his vision dystopian, his method scatological -- but his employment of each of these things is exact, controlled with a sense of schizophrenic indifference.<br/><br/>If my reassessment of the man is correct, perhaps my judgment of his films -- and A Clockwork Orange in particular -- will change. I was much younger, not very well-read, and certainly an amateur in film when I saw it the first time. It was so far beyond any concept that I'd previously encountered that it was at once engrossing and alienating.<br/><br/>But I've come to understand that may have been Kubrick's point. Like Alex DeLarge -- strapped to a chair while undergoing aversion treatment (brainwashing) -- we are meant to be the subjects of the experiment. Kubrick forces us to identify with DeLarge in both his redeemable and his irredeemable qualities, and in so doing he holds a pitch-black satirical and scabrous mirror up to us and, like a distorted reflection in the Fun House Hall of Mirrors, the initial reaction is one of disgust. But Kubrick says that it is not the mirror that is distorted; it is our self-perception.<br/><br/>I suppose I should've understood this sooner. The iconic cover art/poster of the movie is of DeLarge, wearing strange make-up, holding a bow and arrow aimed directly at anyone looking at him. At the tip of the arrow is an eyeball, and this simultaneously seems to be both an accusation and a warning: Kubrick is telling us we are being watched and convicted by proxy of Alex DeLarge.<br/><br/>Whatever else it might be, it is a neat trick, deftly executed, and nausea-inducing."

","Having heard so much about Stanley Kubrick and this movie, atlast I got to watch it. For a movie made in 1971, I was completely blown away by the sheer brilliance of it. Without giving away much, A Clockwork Orange is based on a novel of the same name by Anthony Burgess. Set in the future Britain where 16 year old Alex is jailed after one his raped victims die, he volunteers for an experiment designed by the government in an effort to solve the crime problems of the society. To begin with, I must admit, A Clockwork Orange is undoubtedly one of the most artistic pieces of cinema I have seen in a long, long time. The character of ""Alex"" (played brilliantly by Malcolm McDowell) is pure evil, sending shivers down your spine. Everything about him is so evil, so dark. The movie, which looks more like a stage-play version and less like a movie is enthralling, especially the conversations between Alex and his partners. The movie is disgusting, dark, sinister, gross, violent and very very artistic. The power of the movie is that it stays for hours after it has ended. In fact, this is one of the reasons why it took me a day and a half before I got down to review this movie, those disturbing images stick with you in your head... ""A Clockwork Orange"" is one of the best films that I've seen and I wish I never see it again.<br/><br/>The performances are all top-notch and it wouldn't be wrong to say that Malcolm McDowell's ""Alex"" is in the same league as Sir Anthony Hopkins' ""Dr. Hannibal Lector"". The background score goes perfectly with the movie's theme. The dialogues are both, very well-written and very well delivered. Honestly, its tough to find negative things about a movie that's, in my opinion, nearly flawless, but here's what I could manage to find: The movie starts losing its grip towards the middle. Some scenes in the movie were completely unnecessary and the nudity element could've been cut down a little, it disgusts you but I guess that's exactly why Kubrick chose to put it in the first place.<br/><br/>""A Clockwork Orange"" is strongly recommended for anyone that loves cinema in its purest form. It has everything you could ask for... and then some more. Of course there's a lot of violence and nudity in the movie but it all serves the purpose. Rated to be one of Kubrick's best pieces of work (I wouldn't know coz I haven't seen much but it's definitely one of the best I have seen), ""A Clockwork Orange"" is almost perfect in every term. Watch it, if for nothing else, then an experience called ""Kubrick's cinema"" that you're surely not going to forget for a very long time.... if ever!!! Rating:- 8.5/10"
"oanagabrielapredescu","10","0","1","8 July 2008"," A movie which can become an obsession
","I heard about ""A Clockwork Orange"" from a book. The synopsis made me see it. Before I saw the movie, I must admit the fact that I was a bit scared (maybe because I was only 14). I can't explain my fear, but ACO is that kind of movie which gives off plenty of energy even before you see the movie. You can feel it... In my opinion, ""A Clockwork Orange"" can be considered an amazing symbiosis between different kinds of art: the music, the backgrounds, the colors, the futuristic ideas... all is so original, so vanguard, that can give the impression of a real premonition. Firstly, ACO is a hard-worked movie. En-detail, I'd say. Kubrick took into account all the aspects and managed them minutely, in the most attentive way. The script, after Anthony Burgess' novel, is a fabulous combination of irony, satire, drama, a real psychological test. Also, all the other ingredients, like ""nadsat"" accent or the amusing tongue-twisters create the impression of a contemporary fable. I must, also outline the delicious harshness and black humor. The actors, despite the fact that they weren't important names, at that time, are acting memorable. Alex DeLarge, played absolutely stunning by Malcolm McDowell, gets an unreasonable aureole, which intrigues, fascinates, even delights you. McDowell knew how to capture in a great manner all the subtleties of such a character: the attitude, the way he looks (with those unique and penetrating blue eyes), the way of communicating. He's absolutely impressive. As Burgess said in an interview, Alex in not a psychopath, he is a young and intelligent man who was born in an inappropriate conjunction, and, instantly, he finds the refuge in torturing the others, because his intellectual potential wasn't directed in a right way, wasn't exploited enough and started to grow like a weed, for shameful ends. The theme of the movie and the book is up-to-date: the problem of ""mental prison"". Practically, Alex was acting with, but also, without his will. He didn't have a point of reference. He was thirsty of getting money and adrenaline, of listening to the music and, above all, he wanted to be a diabolically leader. He enjoyed raping, stealing, beating, but, at the same time, he wanted to make the impression that he was, in fact, a honorable member of the society. He was trying hard to create a great image about him. He was totally unstable: from unpardonable acts of vandalism he was instantly adopting a polite, humble, even lecherous attitude. The ""Ludovico"" technique took from him the power of choosing: The machine against the man. That's why the title is ""A Clockwork Orange"" because we can see the terms ""organic"" and ""mechanic"" in a permanent conflict and struggle. This obsessive game is accompanied by the fulminating music of L.V. Beethoven, Edward Elgar, Nikolai-Rimsky Korsakov, Henry Purcell, in a hilarious antithesis with Nancio Herb Brown's ""Singin' In The Rain"", another tool if irony. <br/><br/>Maybe this is the single movie I can consider a harmless but poignant drug."

","It is often a dark and uncomfortable journey through the mind of Stanley Kubrick, but he once again draws from the depths of human nature to deliver another startling and brilliant work of art in the form of 'A Clockwork Orange'. It won't keep you feeling warm and safe at night, and you'll never listen to 'Singin' in the Rain' quite the same way ever again, but at least you'll have someone to thank for it.<br/><br/>Calloused and cold-blooded, 'A Clockwork Orange' is not unlike Orwell's cautionary '1984' or Huxley's provocative 'Brave New World'. It explores a society gone astray, where anarchy meets fascism. A paradoxical combination, but a dangerous one if there ever were such a thing. This is an experience you are likely to never forget, for better or for worse. You'll want to look away, you'll want to squirm, you will hate Alex, but through it all, you will find your eyes glued to the screen in a haunting and poetic sort of way.<br/><br/>If there's one thing 'Clockwork' should be remembered for, remember it for the sets. The lavish, extravagant, wondrous, and colorful sets. Your senses will become intoxicated, and few films bleed such a thick and disturbing atmosphere as Kubrick's strange vision does here. Entertaining may not be the key word here, it often wasn't when it came to Stanley, but it is a film that can be appreciated for its raw beauty and unabashed sexuality.<br/><br/>Alex never truly comes to see himself as the horror he really is. He doesn't understand the twisted beast within him, and neither do we. We will never see it in ourselves, but will jump at the opportunity to brand others. 'A Clockwork Orange' sears our memory with powerful and evocative imagery that's difficult to face but equally difficult to resist. Its sarcastic humor will tickle you, only to further itself with even more into a dark world. Stanley Kubrick has crafted a lasting cinematic journey that lives on through the cold annals of 'A Clockwork Orange'.<br/><br/>More reviews at rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public"

","A Clockwork Orange is one of those rare films that you really can't compare anything to. It is so unique in a good way. Watching it is kind of like having a surreal dream but one you wake up remembering. Malcolm Mcdowell is cast perfectly as Alex, the leader of a group of violent punks who both admire him and are afraid of him. Alex is chosen to participate in an experiment that will cure him of his violent behavior by brainwashing him to be a proper citizen. He is forced to watch hour after hour of violence on a movie screen until just the pure thought of violence makes him want to vomit. There's more to the experiment then that but that's the gist of it. The group of punks even have their own language that they speak to each other but not so obscure that the audience can't grasp it. When the controversial film was released, it sparked much violence in England where a few too many audience members were inspired by Alex and his gang of punks. The director, Stanley Kubrick, forbid the movie playing there again to his dying day. You'll never think of the song ""singing in the rain"" in the same way again and you'll see why. Let's hope the day doesn't come when this movie isn't made into a lame remake starring Leonardo Decaprio. GOOD STUFF!"

","""A Clockwork Orange"" is a film directed by Stanley Kubrick, my favorite film directer.<br/><br/>Set in the near future in England and the story follows a young man named Alex DeLarge. He's a reader of a gang group which does every criminal things we can imagine. One day they broke in old lady's house and Alex killed her accidentally- He wouldn't know until the police told him-. He was arrested and put in a jail. He could not stand the life in prison and was trying to find way to get out. Then he decided to donate himself for a secret program which was testing for prisoners.<br/><br/>Such a ironical and beautiful film. They did a great work especially in music.

","This is a film difficult to categorize. The central characters enjoy violence, rape and causing havoc. But really, at no time does this film make you feel uncomfortable as other films of this nature would. Occasionally funny, rarely frightening and always weird and entertaining, ""A Clockwork Orange"" remains a visual and conceptual masterpiece that is truly timeless.<br/><br/>The film is based on the book of the same name by Anthony Burgess. The book, whilst difficult to read due to the gangster language it is (and indeed the film) is written in, is certainly worthwhile and of course has an ending which could only be described as the polar opposite to the ending of the film. The story follows the youth Alex DeLarge, marvelously played by Malcolm McDowell, and his three hoodlum friends with a bizarre dress sense and a penchant for violence and mayhem of all forms. These dangerous sociopaths, lead by Alex wreak havoc on the wider community.<br/><br/>When he is betrayed by his crew the law catches up with Alex, he is sent to a correctional facility and becomes a guinea pig for an experimental drug, designed to rid criminals of their evil impulses. Needless, the say the film asks the ethical question; is it better to be able to choose to be bad, or become incapable of that choice at all? McDowell steals the show as Alex, surely one of the most enduring cinematic performances ever. And the film is everything you would expect from a Kubrick film; it transcends the normal world and dazzles the viewer with a visual spectacle.<br/><br/>There is also moments of humour in the film. A Clockwork Orange is probably most infamous for the way it 'glamourises' violence, particularly through Alex. Alex is a bad guy, the worst. But as he narrates to the audience/reader it is almost as if an endearing relationship of trust is being born. Alex refers to the viewers as 'my brothers' and at one stage 'my brothers and only friends' we can't help but feel some strange empathy for Alex. On the one hand he is vicious and calculated, but he himself is a child and very vulnerable. His mannerisms are often child-like, but he still possesses all the qualities of the dominant alpha-male. He is a complex character and one that has caused much controversy because he is notoriously hard to dislike. This is why this book and film was such a shock to the establishment. What is wrong with us if we like a person who does such evil things? Importantly, whilst that film does delve into ethical issues, it does not explore them at the expense of entertainment. Almost every scene is memorable and often haunting."

The movie was good in facts like ligth, idea, characters and all that stuff, but I don't know if the main character, learn something or change.

I think that the movie is very futuristic (or I don't know what really say about the time), because of the decoration of the bar,the type of the car, the clothes of the women (even Alex's mom. They use wig and a lot of make up)and mens too (the crazy white clothes with ayes in the cuff), and the different places.

","A Clockwork Orange is by far one of my favorite movies of all time, and also my favorite novel. This film takes you on a disturbing, artistic voyage through the demented mind of a young ""droog"" named Alex, and through this voyage we learn the importance of one's natural freedom and free will as a human being. Though absurd in morality, Alex portrays some of the most important messages in life in that we are all entitled to natural freedom, and all choices have consequences. <br/><br/>The film is almost psychedelic in nature with the artistic imagery used by Kubrick to the scores of classical composers such as Ludwig Van Beethoven. This film may disturb most of its viewers, but in a way the disturbing aspects of the film will bluntly express a horrifying and perversely portrayed message.<br/><br/>Although the book is usually better than the movie, this film is not far behind its novel. The only flaw of the transition of novel to film is that the novel and film do not share the same ending. But this is not Kubrick or the producer's fault. Unfortunately, the American publishers of this book felt that the final chapter of the book wasn't necessary and decided to cut it out. The edition of the book with it's original ending was not released until the 80s so Kubrick missed out on the ending his film deserved.

Direction and camera-work are top notch. The lingo and conversations are wonderfully strange and bizarre spoken in British-dialect English - they give a cleverly added layer of different time and place. Clearly much thought is weighed on subjects of crime, punishment, and reform as central themes, but the motivation and drive of the story is an immersion into the hooligan mindset - an anarchy against societal rules and etiquette in total disregard of the government and fellow citizens. Questions are posed of age old punishments vs. new-wave reformations. Kubrick and the screenwriter have crafted the feel of mischief and mayhem better than any other movie to date imo. Malcolm McDowell's devilishly wanton character is the quintessential ""bad apple"", and wonderful to follow with expository narration. Great use of music as well. Highly recommended."

","Alex is a bright but vicious young hoodlum who spends his nights looting, raping and drinking with his gang of droogs, but when he kills a woman he is caught and sentenced to life in prison. He volunteers for a revolutionary new drug/therapy treatment designed to cure him of his violent tendencies, but what will it really do to his mind and freewill ?<br/><br/>This astonishing film, like so many by this amazing director, has no other to compare it to; it is simply unique. There were a spate of dystopian science-fiction movies made in the early seventies - Soylent Green, THX 1138, Rollerball, Logan's Run, etc - all of which vaguely look and feel like each other, but none of them are anything like Kubrick's future shock classic. Instead of spending a fortune on flashy spotless techno-sets, it was shot in incredibly ugly (even by sixties standards) concrete housing estates in Thamesmead and Wandsworth in south London and concentrates on its characters and social setups. Its genius is not to focus on what the future looks like, but what life would be like, and its prophecy of a bland, uncaring society and a government obsessed with popularity, social engineering and restricting personal freedom is absolutely bang-on (if you don't believe me, think about how much our leaders now spend on polls and thinktanks and how much legislation they pass simply because they don't trust us). Morally, it also has a completely original structure - it gives us a loathsome, horrible protagonist, shows him at his very worst, and then asks us to identify and sympathise with him as he is pulped through a cruel political machinery seeking only to exploit him. Through your reaction to this, Kubrick is really defining your own character, an incredible thing for a movie to do. If you think Alex really is an irredeemable thug (as so many self-appointed moral guardians did when the movie was released) then you know very little of human nature and how environment influences us. But if you sympathise with him (as I do), what does that say about you ? Through Alex, the movie examines the odd connection and conflict between morality and intelligence / identity / creativity, and does so on multiple levels - personal, social, religious, even biological. Kubrick's chief desire in his movies was to get the audience to think and ask questions, and the ultimate question here is when Alex is cured at the end, is that good or bad ? My answer is that it's both good and bad, but it's undeniably sensational and mindbending. The lynchpin of these questions, and the film in general, is the career-best performance by the sublime McDowell as Alex. I think it's simply one of the best in any movie, an exceptional example of the perfect actor for the part at the perfect point in his career, firing on all cylinders. He simply is Alex; he's physically amazing, he grasps the tone (especially the humorous aspects) of the character completely, he understands the movie's purpose and he plays each scene with incredible power, his cunning blue eyes and gleeful smirk burning up the screen. This is not straight drama or method acting, it's an extremely stylised performance to suit the movie, but it's just sensational in every way. The moment in the penultimate shot, when McDowell grimaces and stares insanely upwards, his bestial machismo restored, is the ultimate Kubrick Look, which recurs in many of his films, but never better personified than here. The rest of the cast are a terrific bunch of weirdos, notably Clarke, Morris and Stone, and Sharp gives his oily politician just the right mixture of snobbish disdain and patronising double-talk. This was the first of three films that Kubrick made with cameraman John Alcott and right from the amazing opening pull-back in the milkbar almost every frame is both incredible and original; I think my favourite shot is the circular reverse tracker on Alex as he walks through the music boutique. This is a terrific Steadicam shot - the only problem is it was filmed five years before the Steadicam was invented, so how on earth was it done ! The other crucial element is the fantastic pioneering electronic score by Walter/Wendy Carlos, which is combined with inspired source music (Rossini's La Gazza Ladra, Elgar's Pomp And Circumstance, Gene Kelly's Singin' In The Rain) to make the delirious visuals even wilder. This movie is so original it even has its own language, the Nadsat (a great jumble of English, Russian, slang, Biblical phrasing and made-up words) which results in such wonderful lines as, ""Come and get one in the yarbles, if ya have any yarbles, you eunuch jelly thou !"". Sadly and shamefully, here in the UK the film was stigmatised as glorifying violence (Straw Dogs and The Exorcist suffered similar fates) and a hate campaign against Kubrick resulted in his pulling it; outside of bootlegs it was impossible to see here until after his death in 1999. This is both extraordinary - that a director would have the power to pull his own movie out of circulation - and detestable - that philistine idiots who object to artistic freedom would resort to the type of violence they pretend to be protecting everybody else from. The movie remains a work of total genius, and its stunning originality and extraordinary imagery are to be savoured. Based on a great novel by Anthony Burgess."

","Stanley's Kubrick's vision of a dystopian future is arguably his most accomplished film. Highly controversial on first release A Clockwork Orange was undoubtedly way ahead of its time and to this day remains an engaging, bold and brilliant satire on the corruption and hypocrisy of a fickle society. At the centre of this, the film remains chillingly topical, demonstrating the debate between free-will versus conformity with a distinct visual approach and creative structure. The best element of this film is the wickedly funny dialogue, a highly inventive take on delinquent orientated slang, but what makes the film a masterpiece is Kubrick's flawless direction. Every scene is beautifully composed and imaginatively stylish, combining zooms, tracking shots, pans and inventive close-ups coupled with some deliriously original editing that pays homage to the class system and engaging pop-art. The film remains a hallmark of modern cinema that is rivetingly brilliant, combining stunning visuals, darkly funny dialogue and insanely catchy music to amazing and accomplished effect.<br/><br/>10/10"

","One of my biggest wishes about this movie is that Stanley Kurbrick were alive to see the huge and successful re-release of his perfectly brilliant artwork.<br/><br/>Malcom McDowell plays the sly and cunning Alex. He likes a bit of the old ultra-violence with his three drogues. As far as I'm concerned is this movie is often extremely under rated, I was glad to see that it was in the IMDb top 250.<br/><br/>A Clockwirk Orange is visually brilliant, absolutely stunning; hardly any faults. After watching this memorable masterpiece you will have lines, music and scenes in your head. Still giving the impact of what they did while you were watching it. Singing in the rain will never be the same to you. The elements and effects of drama in this movie are outstanding, it's one of the most powerful films I have ever seen and one of the best perspective of the future (even though it was made in the late 60s). This movie has an unbelievable power to it, that creeps you and keeps you interested at the same time. You see the main directing signature of Stanley Kurbrik a lot, the P.O.V (point of view) shot. Although the movie focuses on the more horrible sides of life, you still get a good feel from it by the end; and that is what helps keep this movie brilliant, you DO NOT lose interest in it. Every part of it is extremely attractive, the beginning, the middle and Kurbrik even managed to give it an ending to suit it. The amazing flash backs and shots showing how Alex is thinking helps to also make the brilliance more obviously shining; and to think of how low budget this amazing attraction is or was.<br/><br/>I recommend this to anyone whose ever liked any 'off beat' film and can handle a bit of violence. 9.7/10"

","This extra-ordinary classic novel by Anthony Burgess originally sold to the Rolling Stones for $500 was picked up by the great Stanley Kubrick who wrote the screenplay and produced and directed it. The film set in the future uses a language created by Burgess , Nadsat, which is a mixture of English and Russian slang. <br/><br/>Story revolves around a stylistic gang leader Alex and his gang the droogs. Alex and his mates not only indulge in violent robberies involving rape but also attack rival gangs with their successful style of ultra violence. Alex also loves seducing very young teenage girls for group sex and this is displayed in the film at high speed to William Tells Overture. He is also obsessed with Beethoven's 9th symphony in D minor which gives him delusions off grandeur and manic elation especially during a scene when he turns on his fellow gang members. A graphic scene follows where Alex and his subjugated gang carry out a home invasion to the theme of the Rossini's Thieving Magpies overture. <br/><br/>Alex is caught and imprisoned for the murder of the old spinster owner. Alex undergoes a new and radical procedure of ""Aversion Therapy"" to suppress his violent and sexual tendencies. Unfortunately this therapy also leaves Alex unable to function within the realms of his personality creating disastrous Psychological problems. Alex is unable to defend himself when attacked by various of his victims including his former fellow gang members who are now Police. Eventually Alex stumbles across a wealthy political activist Mr Alexander who is trying to overthrow the government and seeks solace with him. Unfortunately for Alex Mr Alexander recognises him as the man who raped and murdered his wife during a home invasion. <br/><br/>Mr Alexander tries to expose the Governments use of Aversion therapy as an abuse of human rights but it backfires and Alex becomes a hero indulged upon by the Government. <br/><br/>Kubrick withdrew the film when censored in Britain. It a classic on every level."

","I really do feel it should have taken home the best picture Oscar in 1971.Truely a masterpiece. Anyway, the real reason i'm posting this comment is for two distinct reasons.<br/><br/>#1) Before I saw the movie I read the book. As soon as i finished the book(which i read in about 24 hours,after periodic breaks. Also my favorite book of all time) I borrowed the DVD of the film from a friend and watched it. At First I didn't know what to think.The questions that crossed threw my mind were ""Was this film even worthy of all this hype?"" or ""Was that just the greatest movie i've ever seen?"" The truth is folks, this is one of the better films ever made,I certainly agree this is Kubricks best film. It one of those movies that is so strange and different that you cant help but to love it. The only real flaw that I found in the film that i didn't like was all the perverted photos and art in the film(which is prob. the strangest part of the film, though I understand its purpose, i felt some of it was a little senseless.<br/><br/>#2) The Ending. This film ends on one the greatest ""What the hell just happened?"" final scenes of all time. You really can't tell 100% whether or not Alex would continue his old ways or change because of his experiences. The final quote of the film ""I was cured alright"", not to mention the tone in which Alex says it, leads me to believe that he would continue his old ways(though it the book it is apparent in the final chapter that we wants to change).<br/><br/>This Film is absolutely amazing. Without a doubt in my top 5 favorites of all time. I really enjoyed the book a lot more than the film, but there no question that A ClockWork Orange is one of the better films of all time."
"sethasa","8","0","2","20 February 2008"," Not SCI-FI
","A remarkable movie in all respects, ""A Clockwork Orange"" has the capacity to render one helpless from both laughter and shock. Few other movies can deliver in such a way. There are also few people who would disagree that Stanley Kubrick created an amazing experience in film.<br/><br/>That being said, I have never seen this as a work of science fiction. When a movie takes place in the future it isn't science fiction any more than when it takes place in the past. It is simply a period piece; which are always works of fiction because none of us live in either the future or the distant past.<br/><br/>Science fiction requires two elements: science and fiction. More importantly, science fiction requires 'fictional science'.<br/><br/>""A Clockwork Orange"" has a fictional futuristic world with very little fictional science. The brainwashing could be considered science fiction, I suppose... but then any movie with a brainwashing sequence in it would also have to be considered science fiction... which would have to include a number of 'action' movies (like the ""Bourne"" trilogy).<br/><br/>I would catalog ""A Clockwork Orange"" as a dark comedy or an action drama. At it's best it is a philosophical commentary on the possible future of society with a disengaged youth at the helm.<br/><br/>In my opinion, however, without a dramatically different political structure, robots, cloning, spaceships, advanced weaponry, designer viruses, improbable gadgets, psychics, or any other common elements of 'fictional science' in the science fiction genre, this cannot be dubbed sci-fi. A great movie? Yes. Science Fiction? No."

I wasn't disappointed oh no...but when i read the book i found somethings that Kubrick either didn't want to make in the movie or something that was just corrected or changed entirely, some of those things really drives me crazy.<br/><br/>Anyway for a movie this is a masterpiece, how the opera music fits in to the fighting scenes is really breathtaking, that no one didn't think of that before.

","Clockwork Orange is what you want to understand it to be. Some may find the movie very gross, that is. But some who see this film see it as the greatest film made, people such as myself, and can see through the carnage. The message of the movie is, you choose what you want to be, no matter what. You can be that kind of person, who does evil, the person you choose to be, or be a good person. That is the main message. It is up to the one who is evil to realise, what he/she is doing, doing is wrong. And the choices they make that make them to the person they are. You cannot make a man good, it is his will to do so. Clockwork Orange is a cinematic masterpiece, because of the way it was done. Truly showing how sinister the wold can be, even if i is set in the future. Again, i say that clockwork orange is a masterpiece, not because of its depiction of a future gone wrong, nor of the raw brutality of human beings(although these are very important factors which make this movie great), but the message of choice, choice to be good, or be evil."

","In a new future, the society has gone to an offspring. Alex is a charismatic intelligent guy that loves violence and evilness. He is the leader of a gang and we can see him doing some act of terrific ultra-violence, just for fun. When he is arrested, as he wants to leave prison early, he accepts to be part of a new treatment which will cause him to be a good citizen. This is one of the best Kinrick's movies. Cruel, satiric, intelligent. The fact that ultra-violence is shown to us with lots of ironic and black humour, in almost a hypnotic-oniric way makes it special, then, violence becomes wonderful, and this disturbs you, which is specially the main of the director, he is able to make you love such a disgusting guy. Then, as the violent becomes the Government, Alex is just a victim, a guy that only wants to live quiet, and the ""law"" is the ultra-violent there, programming the prisoners, making them fools that cannot decide freely.<br/><br/>It is a critic not only to the violence (of course violence is bad) but also to the way that a country uses to fight against it, which are the limit should not be passed? Who will guard the guards? With all these thing in mind, th movie is just a masterpiece, disturbing and sometimes uncomfortable, but impressively good. The choose of Malcolm as the main actor is just perfect, he is able to play perfectly this not so mad danger and makes us ask ourselves why he was not even nominated to Oscars. may cause repulsion due to its violence (though lot of time has passed!) but it is totally good. Recommended to everyone able to think about ethics and who wants to watch to a good movie that makes you think."
"Jonny_Numb","9","0","2","16 August 2007"," Kubrick's One True Masterpiece
","Stanley Kubrick is easily one of the most overrated directors of all time, but I will say that ""A Clockwork Orange"" is a singular masterpiece that still carries an effect, 36 years later. I think this has less to do with Kubrick the director than Kubrick the adapter--working from Anthony Burgess's novel of the same name, rich with food for thought, the director does not skimp on the intertwining strings of morality, religion, criminality, science, and the State that mark Alexander DeLarge (Malcolm McDowell, in an iconic role)'s descent through a literal mindf*ck in order to curtail his delinquent desires. Kubrick's ""point-and-stare"" technique, usually an invitation for sleep, is properly observant and well-utilized here: the characters convey the aforementioned commentary in a lively, sly way (from Alex's 'droogies' to the pitch-perfect Aubrey Morris as the perpetually-grinning Mr. Deltoid). While time has diminished the shocks that made the film controversial upon initial release, the morality-play structure is still well-executed and compelling, culminating in a scene revolving around Alex, a plate of spaghetti, and a bottle of wine that is nothing short of masterful. There are many more scenes like this, but like the rest of ""A Clockwork Orange""--they are best experienced cold. Highly recommended, and that's coming from someone who thinks the rest of Kubrick's filmography is negligible."

Nowhere have I seen an anti-hero as Alex is, nor a movie so perfect as Kubrick's. My advice to all who wish to see this movie, is this: watch it over and over again, listen carefully, even turn on the subtitles if necessary (as it was for me), to entirely understand and reach the full height of this incredible movie. Watch it loud, watch it alone, watch it in sheer awe. Unfortunately for me, I had only rented it, and had to work each day, but each chance I had, I did this very thing. I need to own this movie, and you will agree. Kubrick is an absolute genius, and this movie is the perfect reflection of that! The perfect movie. Real horrorshow."

"blanbrn","10","0","1","29 June 2007"," Raw and wicked. Stanley Kubrick's take on the mind and macabre.
","""A Clockwork Orange"" is clearly a film of delight, pleasure, and just flat out raw drama and horror. The scenes and images during the film are highly remembered and stunning especially the colorful displays in houses and the sculptured mannequins in the milk bar at the films start. Also flashing images of nude women and even Christ are hard to leave one's mind after watching the film. The story is a great take on character study of the mind and how it can change. You have Alex(Malcolm McDowell) a thug and modern day hooligan who along with his friends enjoy having fun at the expense and tragedy of others. You name it Alex and his sidekicks roam modern day Britian in search of terror, from violence to the attacks and rapes of women. A viewer will find many scenes of this film disturbing . Until one day Alex's little playhouse comes crashing down when caught he's sent to prison. Upon arrival he begins the journey of reform it's only when a new experiment of a mind and ego transplant takes place that really changes him and it makes this film a different story from the second half on. Alex then upon release finds himself a different person now a proper citizen after being brainwashed it's crazy to see him encounter his family, friends, and many victims after his release it's just not the same as the guilt, remorse, and sorrow drive him to be crazy and again a need to be dark. Really I just love the way that Kubrick showed how one's mind can change and that people can take on new and different personalities and behavior, and yes I believe anything is possible by mind manipulation and tinkering. Really a film that shows two sides of a central character like Alex the good and the bad proving that the mind and one's own free will and choice either makes or breaks you. To sum it up ""A Clockwork Orange"" is one of the best films made because of the images, and the music theme is creepy and spooky it really tingles your skin, Stanley Kubrick as always pushes the limits by showing another side to humanity and life proving that having fun and a good feeling can both be great. A final say this classic proved still that much is still to be discovered in terms of the mind and of the future, clearly an unforgettable picture."
"TheMovieCritic_83","9","0","1","26 June 2007"," Amazingly deep.
","There aren't a lot of films that can generate as many feelings as 'A Clockwork Orange'. It has been stated that the amount of controversy this film has caused, amounts to more than all of the controversy of Stanley Kubrick's other films combined. I have to agree with that. The film has been accused of inspiring real life crimes, (of which some claims are undeniably true), and Stanley Kubrick and his family were hit with death threats upon it's release. The film was soon withdrawn from viewing in England, and that stayed in effect for about thirty years. This amazingly deep film has been praised, despised and in some cases been thoroughly misunderstood.<br/><br/>The film takes place sometime in the near future, in which society has become completely morally corrupt. The central character is a sadistic teenage gang leader called Alex who, along with his 'droogs', commits violent crimes on other citizens, purely for the fun of it. When Alex accidentally murders a woman, he is imprisoned and used as a test subject for the latest method of criminal reform therapy, which guarantees to render criminals as harmless to society. After the therapy backfires, the political party responsible attempts to cover their tracks.<br/><br/>'A Clockwork Orange' has excellent performances, a complex script, and many important themes that it explores. Alex is one of the most nihilistic characters ever to appear on the screen. We know how repulsive his actions are, and yet disturbingly, there is an element of likability about him. A tricky combination to perform, but Malcolm McDowell manages to do it. After an insight into Alex's evil mind, Stanley Kubrick brilliantly flips the film around and throws a strong anti-violence message at the audience. This is an important moment as it explains why the horrific scenes of vulgarity have taken place in the film so far. This scene is one of the ultimate director's traps as it confronts viewers who have enjoyed the scenes of violence by making it clear that Alex, (and by extension, anyone else who can see a reflection of themselves in him) is in a corrupted and unhealthy state.<br/><br/>Ultimately, 'A Clockwork Orange' is an extremely dark study of the worst traits and instincts of human nature. It is clear that Stanley Kubrick's outlook on people is very bleak as there is hardly a character with any redeeming features. Obviously, he was concerned about what the state of society would be like in years to come, and in some ways, it's turned out to be the way the film presents it.<br/><br/>This is a brilliant, but risky film to have made. Brilliant in the way it deals with so many themes (the film could be analysed exhaustibly) and the very important statements that it makes. The film is risky in the sense that it features heavy subject matter that too many people misinterpret. As mentioned before, on the film's release some even went to the extreme of committing crimes that were inspired by scenes in the film. The messages in the film were obviously lost on those viewers, and I would imagine that some fans today also miss the point and watch 'A Clockwork Orange' purely for its violence and other off-putting content. The amoral nature of the film serves to make some strong points, and should disturb it's viewers.<br/><br/>One of the most remarkable things about Stanley Kubrick's films is the way they never date and are more relevant as time goes on, and 'A Clockwork Orange' is a prime example. It's just a pity about the negative consequences that have resulted from this amazing, but sometimes misunderstood film."

I think this film makes people feel uneasy because of the amazing performance of McDowell (Alex), you hate what he does but you love his character. In many ways it is very much like other Kubrik films being split into three portions Alex free to do what he will, Alex incarcerated, Alex free again but cured. You see this in both 2001 and a full metal jacket a sort of beginning middle and end each act very different from the one another. I do believe that Kubrik intended on 2001 space odyssey being his master piece but some how Clockwork has a much deeper impression on anyone who has seen it and will certainly be considered his masterpiece among film buffs.

"rverne8","8","0","2","3 September 2006"," Theological message
","There are several interesting thematic structures in the movie-one could be called ""violence begets violence."" There are several subcategories here-victimizers who prey on other people are themselves, in all instances, treated more severely by events and other characters than what the law would allow if they were forced to stand trial in a normal way. In one of the many scenes involving gang activity, the would-be perpetrators of a gang rape are interrupted in the midst of their vile actions by Alex de Large and his gang who promptly beat the rivals to an millimeter of their lives while the victim escapes relatively unharmed (physically). This theme is repeated again and again; where justice in society chronically fails to address the criminal and his situation, (what would the suitable punishment be for Alex?), events and other characters lash out in anger (justifiably? We're never certain), at the perpetrator.<br/><br/>The script then links up these many subplots with the larger, and indeed really the only theme of the movie-how is our humanity defined? What is the essence of that inner core of our being that results from us being able to see, to feel, to know that we are human? Again and again (and most of the choices that all of the characters in the movie make, are the wrong ones), the message is ""Take away the choice to perform good or evil (leaving only good) and one's humanness will be trivialized, with tragic results."" This message is delivered explicitly in two dramatic scenes by the Prison Chaplin, who while himself not the most genteel of messengers, serves Kubrick's purpose of counter weighing the cruelty presented by those around him. <br/><br/>Finally the other nagging repetitive theme, repeated to the point of nausea: as criminals become victims (of either revengeful former victims or of a conniving politician) we are left to wonder-can we ever really face senseless cruelty with a suitable, logical, rational response or answer? What sense and meaning is there to a criminal justice system, run by a cruel political entity, whose sole purpose is to unravel a human's inner essence by remaking a criminal into a robotic, 'good' person? Is a person truly morally good (and therefor more valuable to us) if they have no choices left? Kubrick's answer is a resounding 'No!' 'No!' and 'No!' There are some scenes in the movie that are straight out of the situations described so graphically in George Orwell's 1984. Like Orwell, Burgess (and Kubrick) are very interested in and place great value on describing a benign state government that seems to have the best interest of humanity as its core value, only to be revealed, by a complicated set of events that do great harm to a great many people, as a monstrous organism that is interested only in perpetrating itself in the seat of control over events and people. <br/><br/>Finally, a fun activity for watching the movie again (after one is numbed by repetition): replace the nonsensical, unmeaning title with another one. I would suggest ""Resurrection"". Watch the movie again to see why."

","Though many people may argue that Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange is vulgar and disgusting movie, I have found it to be a very entertaining and thrilling movie. Though I do admit the first half hour of the movie is brutal and graphic, it still manages to be very entertaining.<br/><br/>One of the reasons why the movie is so well done is due to the beautiful directing of Stanley Kubrick. I watched the movie very recently and i was stunned to think that something like this was done 35 years ago. Kubrick was always considered a perfectionist in the art of cinema and it definitely shows in this film. The visuals and the art-direction are breath-takingly fabulous.<br/><br/>Another thing that's great about this movie Malcolm Mcdowell's chilling portrayal of Alex de Large (the main character in the film). From beginning to end Mcdowell does an amazing job of sending chills down your spine.<br/><br/>Although the French Connection was a very good movie, in my opinion this film should have won the Oscar for that year. When William Friedkin(director of The French Connection) accepted the award that year for best direction he said, ""Speaking Personally, i think Stanley Kubrick is the best American Filmmaker of the year. In fact, not this year but period."" <br/><br/>Overall, this is a great film and it should not be ignored (although it may not be appropriate for small children). I highly recommend you see, it if you haven't already"

","If one film delineates Stanley Kubrick's work ethic as a director it is ""A Clockwork Orange"". Each scene carries with it a vignette feeling that leaves the viewer mesmerized. Never before has a rebel been so captured in his thoughts or actions as is ""Alex"" in this movie. Mcdowell's character obviously was coached by Kubrick to the point of perfection. The viewer is able to live vicariously through Alex throughout the movie because we see from the beginning every part of his day. Between his relationship with his parents and his partnership with his friends one is never lost in the madness of the movie as one might suppose in a world never before seen. But when Alex and his droogs strike down upon the innocent people of their quaint English town the viewer is not disturbed but rather instilled with a sense of enjoyment. The unconscionable scenes should be horrifying, but Kubrick presents the mind of the teen rebel so vividly that the scenes are more informative and completing than grisly."
"ingemar-4","10","0","1","18 July 2006"," A masterpiece in ultra-violence
","How should violence be presented in a movie, for maximum impact? Should as many people as possible be killed? Should people be killed in as extreme ways as possible? Should the violence be as detailed and gory as possible? Big explosions? Exessive use of firing machine guns?<br/><br/>No. Limit the effects and make it realistic, and the violence will go to the heart and be really nasty. Less is more. This movie is frightening, horrible, despite the fact that you never see much. It is frightening in the same was as Hitchcock's movies were frightening. Even a simple thing as the gang beating up a man is significant, not because of the pain they inflict (which is limited) but because they do it for fun.<br/><br/>The gang, Alex in particular, are close and still distant. You see the world though their twisted eyes. You get all their motives and still they have none.<br/><br/>When I left the movie with my friends, nobody spoke for several minutes. We had seen something very different and tried to grasp what it really was. That alone is a good sign. And what we had seen was a masterpiece."
"GOWBTW","10","0","1","13 July 2006"," The future has never been so disturbing!
","Stanley Kubrik has put up a fine sci-fi thriller about the future where total chaos rules. Even if the world doesn't look like the Apocalypse, the society running with vermin make it look that way. Especially where the The Droogs live. In a futuristic England, these degenerates run around causing havoc and mayhem. They kill, rape, and brutalize anyone who got in their way. Alex(Malcom McDowell) leads the way of these ruthless gangs. He later shows his brutality on his own friends when he hits one of them in the groin with his cane, and hidden inside is a knife that cuts the other's hand. Knowing that he tends to himself at home, out in the open, he's an bomb ready to explode. In one scene, the attacks the woman, his friends leave him behind by breaking his nose with a milk bottle. While Alex is doing some time, I liked the scene were he was being reformed in a sadistic way, where he literally goes out of his mind. Hoping that he is ""cured"" he goes back to society, where his ""friends"" are in law-enforcement. After that suicide attempt, the country gives him the clemency, to me that was not a good idea, after he said, ""I was 'cured' all right!"" That means he can revert to his ways again, if he did that, they won't be so easy next time. A very good but chilling movie, highly intense, and very disturbing scenes. This movie is not for the weak! Rating 5 stars!"
"MOscarbradley","10","0","2","6 July 2006"," As shocking as it ever was
","Kubrick's great comedy is as dark and as shocking as it ever was and as we march further into the 21st Century it's view of Britain is no less chilling than it was in 1971, (even more so, if anything). In fact, it's prescient view of a dystopsian state makes you realise how ahead of its time it really is and how, if made today, would seem an unsubtle and outright condemnation of Blair's Britain.<br/><br/>It's sci-fi leanings notwithstanding, the film gives us an uncannily accurate portrait of an cancerous society ruled by young thugs and policed by sadistic, corrupt politicians and law-makers. It's as if Kubrick and the original author, Anthony Burgess, had second sight. As Alex, leader of a gang of 'droogs', out only 'for a bit of the old ultra-violence and in-out in out', Malcom McDowell is magnificent. He was fresh from Lindsay Anderson's ""If"" and his cocky arrogance was never captured as well again as in these two films and like the devil he has all the best tunes, raping and killing to the strains of 'Singin in the Rain'. He's a monster who wins you over.<br/><br/>Naturally, it would be hard to warm to this movie but Kubrick's chilly gaze is alleviated by shafts of dark humour and Alex will always be a more approachable anti-hero than Barry Lyndon even if you wouldn't want to meet him on a dark night, or any other night for that matter."

","SEX-BLOOD-MOLOKO PLUS!!! It goes without saying this is not only an awesome movie, but it is also an incredibly fascinating film. This is in my opinion a fine exploration of the nature of human evil. Usually films look at evil from the outside perspective, In Kubrick's a Clockwork Orange we see evil from evil's eye. The story has a profound way of making us see and think in a way we don't usually like to, and also making it almost comfortable. Here is Alex DeLarge, nothing short of one of the most unique antiheroes in cinematic history. He is profoundly evil, cultured, and composed almost effortlessly by Malcom Mcdowell. The story tells of how young Alex goes on a journey from a life of depravity and sadistic violence all the way into the middle of its consequences as well as corrupt political agenda. Malcom Mcdowell absolutely makes this movie, his performance can make you sympathetic to the plot and suffering of a young demon like Alex Delarge. Kubrick said that if he couldn't get Malcom Mcdowell to play the main character that they would not have been able to do the film and this I agree strongly with. Another thing which made it awesome was the language, the script is fantastic. They basically made their own English, and pulled it off beautifully. Also the way they made certain events humorous. Fabulous characters, amazing script, astounding vision, and overall an amazing film. If you haven't seen it you're robbing yourself..."
"Ricky_Roma__","Null","0","1","27 May 2006"," Excellent adaptation of a magnificent novel (spoilers)
","It's not often that you're asked to sympathise with a murderer and a rapist, but in A Clockwork Orange that is most certainly the case. We're asked to feel sorry for a young man who commits the most heinous crimes. And in the end it's hard not to feel for Alex, as he's more humorous, more charming and more alive than any of the other characters.<br/><br/>The reason why Alex elicits sympathy is because, as immoral as he is, everyone else is that bit worse. Every authority figure, every person who should point the way, is either corrupt, self-serving, disingenuous or stupid. Just take Alex's parents. They're not bad people, but they're weak and lifeless; only a saint wouldn't take advantage of them. Then there's Deltoid, Alex's post-corrective adviser. He's a sneering, leering individual, who in a hilarious scene, grabs Alex by the privates (and then later he spits in Alex's face). Then you have the prison chaplain who spouts nonsense about hell and fireballs, the policemen who beat Alex when they interrogate him, the Minister of the Interior who wants to use Alex as a pawn to win votes, Mr Alexander who rescues Alex so that he can use him for his political campaign, Dr Brodsky who uses inhuman treatment to 'cure' Alex, and the Chief Guard in the prison who is a gurning fool. None of these authority figures inspire any confidence and none of them can be trusted.<br/><br/>So compared to this lot Alex doesn't seem so bad. Indeed, he seems more like a child who indulges every whim than an adult who callously breaks the law. Everything is a bit of a lark.<br/><br/>And it's hard not to derive a twisted sort of pleasure out of Alex's adventures. He does all the things people secretly fantasise about doing  stealing cars, smashing people's skulls, raping. And it's part of Kubrick's genius that he never judges Alex. He never wags his finger. Instead he shows everything from Alex's point of view  for him this is one giant laugh. And this also helps make the film more quietly disturbing. The rape scene, for instance, isn't at all graphic, but the joy it gives Alex and his droogs is genuinely unsettling. It's like Kubrick is challenging you to enjoy it, too, to prove that none of us are that far from behaving like animals.<br/><br/>Another excellent scene is the fight between the two gangs. With smashed bottles in people's faces, with people hurled through tables and with people chucked through windows, its presented like something out of professional wrestling; it's funny. And there lies the danger. Most of us are only kept on the straight and narrow by a very thin thread. If only we could unprogram our morality, or if we'd never had it installed in the first place, we'd act like animals too. And who knows, we might have a great time doing it.<br/><br/>But do the so-called civilised people behave any better? Not according to this film they don't. Perhaps the most despicable people are the doctors and scientists. They don't act out of cold-blooded wickedness, but instead out of a thoughtless sense of moral superiority. They want to eliminate crime but at the expense of freedom of choice. And who wants to live in a world like that? Yes misdeeds should be punished but goodness ceases to mean anything if it only becomes a self-protective reflex.<br/><br/>And then there's the Minister of the Interior. He doesn't really care about crime. He doesn't want to solve the problem to make people's lives better. He only wants to do it so that he can win votes. He's contemptible.<br/><br/>So in light of this it actually becomes something of a pity that Alex is conditioned against sex and violence. In the latter scenes you can't help but miss the old him. I mean, the old Alex wouldn't lick someone's shoe would he? But I have to say that this is one of my favourite scenes. I love how camp the actor is, how pathetic his insults are (""Hello, heap of dirt"") and how twee the music is. Kubrick has a fantastic sense of humour. Plus it makes Alex even more pitiful.<br/><br/>Not quite as much fun, but just as effective, is the scene where Alex finds out that Dim and George are policemen. Dim's ""Well, well, well, well, well"" is priceless and the beating is absolutely brutal. Plus it further rams home the point about the police  what's worse, illegal thuggery or legalised thuggery? <br/><br/>And it's also quite amazing that we end up feeling more sympathy for Alex than we do Mr Alexander. After all, Alex rapes his wife and cripples him. But Mr Alexander is another person who claims to be morally superior while being anything but  the scene with the wine is a piece of comic genius; Magee's over the top acting, Alex's attempts to be cultured and his final face plant in the spaghetti always makes me laugh.<br/><br/>So therefore the end ends up being a celebration. I mean, ordinarily we should be upset that a rapist and a murderer has been freed, but compared to everyone else Alex is a ray of light. In a world where everyone is trying to control everyone else his freedom to be as viscous and vile as he wishes is a victory for all of us.<br/><br/>And I do have to say I'm glad that Kubrick didn't film the final chapter of Burgess' novel. In the book, after his triumphant cure, Alex decides to settle down. The point of the chapter is that this whole thing can be seen as a phase Alex is going through. But while the point is more than valid, the execution is lacklustre. It's more than enough just to know that Alex is free to choose his future."

","This is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen and I'm upset that I've waited so long to see it. I'm only 16, of course, but I'm glad I had the opportunity to watch it. I feel like I connected with this movie. Anyone can relate to Alex, driven by temptation and in love with ""ultra-violence,"" the antagonist of this film. If anyone has ever felt powerful and then had that power taken away, they can relate to this movie. If anyone has ever felt so weak as to become the victim rather than the torturer, then they can relate to this movie. Near the end of the film, I felt like I was Alex being drowned by his two former ""gang followers."" Although he did terrible things, Alex is incredible charming and relative that you do not want bad things to happen to him, even though he deserves it. You don't want him to die. Even though it was brought to film only three decades ago, it is very modern. The dialogue is perfect. The acting is excellent. The setting and editing of the film are both wonderful.

","This film is a very heavy-handed dissection of morality and the many forms hypocrisy can take. It's very, very shocking even now, and even more so for its time (when it was nominated for a Best Picture many Hollywood heavyweights refused to even show for the ceremony), and Stanley Kubrick's stale, disgusting vision of the future still strikes a specific, hidden nerve. It tells the story of Alex, a juvenile delinquent who adores violence and rape of all kinds. When he is imprisoned for murder, he becomes a test subject for a new form of torture that is supposed to ""reform"" criminals of violent behaviours by associating images of violence, blood and rape with severe physical sickness. After two weeks, Alex emerges spineless and brainwashed, and considerably less menacing - a clockwork 'orange'; that is, orangutan - symbolic of his weak facade to try and fit into society once more. After this point, it's very hard to watch, because once Alex is released back in his tiny world, he learns there really is no forgiveness of any kind. What's funny throughout is that the violence of Alex and his companions pales in comparison to the violence exerted on them by the government and their world in general - for example, a regular bar is filled with horrifying pornographic images, wholly unnecessary measures and cruelty are used during the treatment...and perhaps most troubling of all is that Alex's former companions, upon his 'reform', have since become part of the police force. There really is no right or wrong. By the end we realize that what we thought was terrible at the beginning doesn't really mean anything. And what's scary is that the lonely world of A Clockwork Orange really isn't too different from our own. From a debate about whether the treatment is 'right' because it doesn't really change desires to harm, it progresses to a point where the actual reform of a human being seems impossible - there's no way how or why somebody would want to change. Even when the possibility of something other than 'an eye for an eye' is introduced, it turns out to be functionally impossible. Both the film-making and the acting are heavily stylized, cloying, and somewhat difficult to watch - all this works well with the intended effect of the film. Malcolm McDowell pulled off a difficult role reasonably well, but he's not too great. The rest of the characters stick in your head in a distinctly Fellini-esquire manner, which makes for a memorable storyline. The themes of regression vs. progression are toyed with in a way that really makes you think about the 'progress' we've supposedly gone through in the past century or so. One faintly amusing thing - I noticed the violence depicted here actually made me sick - exactly like Alex's treatment. Not accidental."

The same sort of indulgence is in the language itself, in the joy of phonetics, saying the word that pleases at that moment, that satisfies the hunger to make a certain sound. The book, of course, offers a greater capacity to enjoy the weirdness of language than does the movie. But the movie has its dialog, and furthermore, what it lacks in verbal narration (thank god it doesn't read the book aloud to us) it makes up for by using music, thereby exploiting an aspect of the film medium that is lacking from literature and other purely verbal media. The movie and the book are both great in their own rights, respectively, though it is fair to judge the movie in terms of Burgess's book, which, as I'm sure all of you know, has a different ending. Speaking of the ending, consider the significance of 21 chapters versus 20 chapters, think of 21 as a number, being 3 7's (7 * 3)."

The first time I viewed it i was just like ""huh, how interesting"" because i hadn't read the book yet. the great film A Clockwork Orange is about a fifteen year old boy named Alexander De Large who loves to rape, kill, and listen to Beethoven.

View on the film: One of the main things that the film does very cleverly (and one of only a handful of others do)is that it lets the viewer have there own interpretation of the film.While some may say that its not the right choice for Alex to like classical music (instead of things like The Doors,Stones,Stooges etc...)I feel that it really suited the character.One of the issues raised in the film, is to show how the mix of images/music can either lighten or darken the images that are on the screen.While it has been said that Burgess did not like how the book was adapted (mainly due to the ending.)I feel that the ending works really well for the film (if they had kept to the books ending,it would have been Alex in a wig and old make-up!)The other major issue the film raises is the use of the media (something for a film made in 1971,is even more important now,and something everyone should learn about due to the current world events.) Final view on the film: One of the most important,original movies ever made.Also it is easily (in my view) Stanley Kubricks masterpiece."

"B_a_S_t_A_r_D","8","0","1","20 March 2006"," The Relevance Will Never Go Away
","One must consider that, for a film made in the very early 1970s, the uniquely bleak vision of a futuristic Britain in ""A Clockwork Orange"" is wonderfully impressive, even by today's standards. Anthony Burgess' adapted neo Shakespearian dialect, combined with Kubrick's inimitable use of imagery conjure up a post apocalyptic world that is not our own and has not yet been.<br/><br/>""A Clockwork Orange"" has not yet lost its edge as a brutally disturbing and unconventionally humorous piece of film-making after thirty five years and is highly unlikely to. In fact, one could argue that its message has always been relevant and apt in any age or society. The film predicted the rash and uncompromising Thatcher era in its second act, and horribly violent street crime, which is at its very peak at the time of writing, in its first.<br/><br/>Combine these ever appropriate values to a film that can be both savage and hilarious in the same minute, and you have before you yet another work of sheer excellence from Stanley Kubrick. ""A Clockwork Orange"" presents Kubrick at his best. No fan of his work will be left disappointed, as every last one of his trademark camera tricks - the slow rolling cam, the iconic, lengthy close up, the sinister face staring right through the screen at you (it is this frequent break of the fourth wall that makes Malcolm McDowell's performance so captivating) - are all here.<br/><br/>Minor faults aside (the unconventional script begins to lose its edge and uniqueness towards the end), ""A Clockwork Orange"" is excellent. The prevailing sense of dread and imminent fear that made ""The Shining"" so effective begins in ""A Clockwork Orange"", via the unique use of the camera, as is a memorable use of iconography not dissimilar to ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" Kubrick is on form, as is McDowell (the two of them became great friends during shooting - this undoubtedly paid off through their unmistakable chemistry) as the severely iconic anti hero Alex. The scenes of immense violence and sexual assault will shock you unlike anything else, the dialogue between Alex and his ""droogs"" will have you laughing out loud, the well placed music and the unfortunate and inevitable outcome of Alex's brainwashing and homecoming is hard hitting. ""A Clockwork Orange"" is a work of genius that every adult should experience."
"chenthom","10","0","1","16 March 2006"," A profound look at human nature
","Kubrick analyzes the Human Condition, and has a very Darwinistic point of view. This film is amazing. Its statement is profound, true, and not so easy to swallow if one hasn't thought about it before.<br/><br/>The beginning of ""2001 - a space odyssey"" recounts that we have evolved from apes and cavemen into a species of great technological finesse. In comparison with other lifeforms on this planet, we possess great intelligence, and high powers of mental abstraction. <br/><br/>However, much of these mental powers were, are, and will be used for the development of weapons needed to satisfy that part in us which is still monkey and caveman. On our evolutionary path, we are not as far from our primitive origins as we would like to believe. Our societies are still pretty barbaric - we haven't overcome violence; we have only succeeded in containing violence by organized force and violence through our governments.<br/><br/>""A clockwork orange"" makes the statement that stealing a person's brutality is inhuman. In doing that, one steals an integral part of what makes us human. No matter how obscene and extreme the violent part of a person is, eliminating the ability of being violent it is deeply immoral.<br/><br/>We humans tend to believe that animals are very far below us on the evolutionary ladder. However, the fact is that an integral part of us has remained completely primitive and barbarian. Human history has not only given us opportunity, but has forced us to learn how to channel our aggressions into more civilized activities (competitive sports, career, etc), and in civilized times, we tend to forget about our potential for utter violence.<br/><br/>However, in times of chaos, political and otherwise, our innate brutality is allowed to erupt without inhibition. Usually, humans will then immerse themselves passionately into genocide and murder, as is well recorded in human history. The moralists try to think deeply about it, and ask: What went wrong ? The answer given in this film is: Nothing went wrong - we are a violent breed, it is our nature. Only the mechanisms containing our violence have broken down.<br/><br/>Alex in ""a clockwork orange"" is that brutal, raging monkey buried inside of us by the nature of our genes, in some deeper than in others. The bottom line is that society, civilization, morals, ethics, and religion all serve as tentative mechanisms to contain the destructive, sadistic devil inside us without which we wouldn't be human."

","starring: Malcom McDowall.<br/><br/>In a futuristic England, groups of teens rape and brutally beat people. One group is led by Alex. The film is really 3 plots in one film. The first 45 minutes of the film are just showing the violent acts of this group including a horrible rape scene and a fast motion sex scene between Alex and two women. Alex accidentally kills a woman and he goes to prison (14 years is the charge). the next 45 minutes are Alex in prison and then being able to go through a treatment that will end his evil ways and let him out of prison. The last part is Alex out of prison, no longer able to do violence, sexually attack women, or listen to Beethoven (you have to see the film to know what i mean). It's very bizarre, but it adds to the film. Malcom McDowall is great, and the character is one where sometimes you want him to die, sometimes you feel sorry for him. The direction is really excellent and the classical music choices really added to it. Excellently done.<br/><br/>My rating: 4/4 stars. rated R for nonstop full frontal male and female nudity, strong sexuality including rape, violence and some brief language. 134 mins."

","Having read Anthony Burgess's novel years ago and working my way through the amazingly creative, futuristic dialogue, I really looked forward to seeing the movie. It was not a disappointment. In the hands of Stanley Kubrick, it comes to life. It is the product of the desensitized world that we see unfolding before us in the beginning of the 21st century. There will be a lot of Alexes in the future; there already are. We are slowly moving away from conventional morality and playing with forms of nihilism. Our politics are beginning to diminish the individual rights and safety of our citizens. Our young people are beginning to band together in little covens, the cell phone and the computer creating little worlds where anonymity can lead to diminution of what is good. Pardon my diatribe, but what Alex and his droogs are doing isn't all that out of the ordinary these days. The manipulative, controlling, anything for ""me"" society is just being formed. Kubrick and Burgess had a a vision. Sometimes this movie is called science fiction. The only science fiction thing about it is that it takes place in the future. The violence we see is the violence of those who no longer care what that word means. This whole world is more frightening than the terrorists we see behind every rock. This enemy is us; or the us yet to be."

","Unlike another critic, I read the book well before I saw the movie. (I was too young for that sort of movie when it came out but, fortunately--by my teen-age years--it had ascended to the status of ""cult classic"" and ran ubiquitously in the Greenwich Village ""art theaters."") Alex leads a gang that gets drugged out at the local ""milk bar"" and then indulges in orgies of violence, rape, and, eventually, murder. The Beethoven fascination that others have mentioned is, frankly, a relatively minor plot component: Alex is a big-time fan of the ""Glorious Ninth"" and enjoys playing it while ""playing doctor"" with girls he's picked up at the local record store. (Odd how, in 1971, the vision of a ""future society"" still included LP records, a technology we did away with decades ago--even though a CD is less flexible: you can't play your favorite part of your favorite song, and you can't play it at 45 to raise its frequency by four steps.) After murdering an old lady (""and me still only fifteen,"" Alex quasi-guiltily monologues to us), Alex is spirited off to a jail where he is treated to the experimental ""Ludovico Technique"" for curing violent offenders by forcefully subjecting them--eyes maintained open with surgical clamps, ears inobstructible--to non-stop barrages of extreme torture, rape, murder, etc. But Alex isn't exactly cured, and, after his return and ""reintegration"" into society, the movie--quite honestly--spirals downward in pace, consistency, texture, and, frankly, excitement. The end result is that Alex is still Alex, still a rapist, still a murderer, and still ""triggered"" whenever he hears Beethoven's ""Ode to Joy"" (a choral section of the Ninth Symphony).<br/><br/>What made the book much stronger than the movie, frankly, was its reliance upon Nadsat, the three-quarters-Russian lingo in which the teen-agers communicate. Thus, ""heads"" are ""gullivers"" (Rus. golowy), ""friends"" are ""droogs"" (Rus. drugi), ""brains"" are ""mozgs"" (Rus. mozaki), drinks are ""peeted with vellocet"" (spiked with speed, though ""vellocet"" obviously hails from the Romance family, not from the East Slavic), etc. It adds tremendously to the pace of the written story if you are quick enough to pick up on the language without having continually to check the appendix to see what is meant when Alex says, e.g., ""I wasn't expecting the millicent, so I hastily slipped my nagoy nogas into my woolly pantoofles."" That was missing from the movie--though it didn't have to be. I remember a cheapo, late '60s or early '70s flick called ""When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth"": upon entering the theater, an usher handed you a card that essentially translated the troglodytes' language into English (yes, I know, cave men opposite dinosaurs: it clearly isn't a paleontology lesson), although Ringo Starr and John Matuszak's hysterical ""Caveman"" managed with only an occasional troglodyte word here and there, which you could always pick up from context.<br/><br/>TO THE EDITORS: MY ""SPELLING ERRORS"" (with the possible exception of inobstructible {please check the OED} and cheapo {well-known slang}) are not misspellings, but either words in Nadsat, an artificial language coined by Anthony Burgess for his novel, ""A Clockwork Orange,"" or transliterations of Russian words into the Roman alphabet per Polish spelling rules. PLEASE DELETE THIS PARAGRAPH. THANK YOU."

","A Clockwork Orange, the most original film i have ever seen. The film is told through the eyes of an uncommon criminal in place of the lovable hero. Our main character usually has an important job, perhaps a family, an obstacle to overcome through hard work and dedication, a woman or a dream. However, in this futuristic cult classic our main character is a young boy with problems, hideous friends, and violent tendencies. When the eyes of this narrator become humbled by prison and society attempts to leash this brute, we see the contradictory lifestyle completely. He becomes institutionalized, and the system of control and social protection takes him apart piece by piece. This film shows the contrast between complete freedom and lack there of. It shows us the tale of a criminals punishment and the life of a person when littered with problems and boundaries. I love this film for it's originality and spunk. It is visually stunning, and in my opinion, Stanly Kubric's best production."

","Before watching ACO i was under the impression that it would be slightly sadistic, violent and as a result almost meaningless in its plot. When i watched this for the first time, in the first half i felt as though my prediction was in fact correct, however, letting it play through to the end i then realised just how wrong i was. The violence in the first half is completely necessary, inviting the viewer to experience Alex's way of life. Not only this, however, but it also appeared to reflect a true image of what society has and will inevitably degenerate to. This being the case, i felt that this film is a true work of art posing moral questions about the government, society, and youth. The script is absolutely fantastic and is complemented by Malcolm McDowell's outstanding performance.Everyone who is even remotely interested in cinema should watch this film.

","A Clockwork Orange is an amazing movie full of imagery, grotesque behavior of rape, fighting, murder, karma, heart-wrenching sympathy and eyebrow-lifting shock combined together in a single wonderful package that (aside from the old-fashioned cassettes and records) defies time.<br/><br/>The movie is told and centered around young Alexander ""Alex"" de Large, who lives in the not-to-distant future as a young and violent sociopath. One of my few complaints is that Alex (McDowell) does not look the age of Alex in the book (teenage).<br/><br/>Alex lives for three main passions: ultra-violence, sex, and Beethoven's masterful classical music. Eventually, however, Alex's cruel and violent behavior catches up to him when he kills an old cat lady. ""You are now a murderer Little Alex,"" laughs Alex's parole officer, and Alex is sentenced to prison for 14 years.<br/><br/>But Alex is quickly sick to the bone of prison and he finds a way out of his long sentence by volunteering as a test subject of the Ludovico Technique: a grotesque and harsh new form of aversion therapy still in the works.<br/><br/>When Alex completes the program, however, everything begins to go terribly wrong. People, who Alex had done wrong to in the past, seek revenge on the now helpless young man. As vicious and torturous karma works mercilessly on Alex, it drives him to the edge and he begins to fear for his future, his humanity, and his life.<br/><br/>Imaginative, inspired, horrifying and satisfying all at the same time, A Clockwork Orange is a strange and somewhat inconclusive movie that raises more issues by its end than answers.<br/><br/>WARNING: A Clockwork Orange is graphic and NEVER holds back. Sex, violence, everything is show except for the guys' genitals. Women are completely naked, raped, and beat around. Guys, while not raped, are certainly treated not much better. It is a bleak future in Alex's world filled with R-rated violence and (surprisingly) not as much bleep-worthy swearing as you one would think."

","I thought a clockwork orange was an excellent movie and one of the best I've seen in a long time. The camera work was especially satisfying, mainly due to the fact that it was made in 1971. Alex, in the movie was one of the most detailed characters I've ever had a chance to view in a movie and the way that even though he was a criminal, viewers cant help but like him and want him to succeed in whatever hes doing. another reason i found this movie very entertaining was the fact that the only music played throughout is Ludwig van Beethoven which was a nice touch and the fact that whenever something disgusting or gory happens, it seems that nice, calm music is being played. It was also one of the first movies I've seen where i really didn't want it to end and it was also very entertaining throughout. And last but not least the most ingenious thing about the whole movie is the fact that it has its own language called Nadscat which every character uses throughout the movie."
"hobbs_j","10","0","1","29 January 2006"," Kubrick's Best Film!
","A Clockwork Orange is the film that represents the film-making prowess of Stanley Kubrick better than any of his other works. The film uses every film-making trick in the book to great effect, and Kubrick manipulates the emotions of the audience like no other filmmaker. The film is cold and detached, yet humanistic. Detractors will say it's a heartless, cruel, overrated piece of subversive porn. In actuality, Kubrick has made one of the greatest films dealing with the right to free- will, and the power of individuality, for better or worse. Wendy Carlos delivers a piercing score. McDowell is a hoot as sadistic, nut case protagonist Alex. Along with Psycho(1960), Bonnie and Clyde(1967), and The Wild Bunch(1969), it stands as one of the most revolutionary films of the Modern Cinema. Worth watching even if you hate it. Viddy well."
"Ludypro1","Null","0","1","17 January 2006"," My all time favorite!
","Let me just start by saying that Stanley Kubrick is my all time favorite director. He is the Michael Jordan of films. Clockwork Orange is by far one of his finest films. If you are a fan of the book, you will be very happy with SK's interpretation of it. It is hard to say why a person would like a film like this. Most people would tend to not like a person like Alex, but for some reason, people like seeing violence on the big screen. A movie like this takes you to a darker side that everyone has thought about going to. The movie is explained in the title. Clockwork Orange. Clockwork is mechanical, an orange is organic. The words are opposite of each other. The first half of the movie is the complete opposite of the last half. Alex inflicts pain on society in the beginning, and in the end, the role of Alex completely switches in the opposite direction. It is a great story that asks the question, ""If man has good imposed upon him, does he cease to be a man?"". I give this movie my highest rating of 10/10. This is the movie that every film buff must see!"
"cmdimovich","8","0","1","12 December 2005"," A psychologically and visually symbolic movie.
","This movie is considered a classic, directed by well-known and inspired Stanley Kubrick, and also based on the novel written by Anthony Burgess. The main character, Alex, has a very anti-social personality and has demeanors showing his 'ultra-violent' lifestyle which he finds irresistible. Alex's testosterone levels seem to be at a very high level, resulting in intensifying his sex hormones as well as his levels of aggression.<br/><br/>Research has shown that there is a correlation between testosterone levels and aggression. Alex's high sex drive and his powerful desire of being aggressive could be a result of high testosterone and ultimately being a factor to his anti-social personality. In the movie, his accentuated private parts are a way of flaunting his sexuality. Making his sexuality so bold and pronounced is another aspect of what I think is from high testosterone and his obsession with sex and sexuality of both himself and of women he victimizes.<br/><br/>Alex's aggressiveness is demonstrated while performing sexual (as well as nonsexual) acts. His violent acts of raping, fighting, and killing greatly add on to his anti-social behaviors. In the Fifth Edition of Perspectives on Personality, it discusses the qualities of human behavior being linked to testosterone, including violent behaviors.<br/><br/>Although Alex may not show pleasant and 'good' choices, he still has the free will inside himself to choose between 'good' or 'bad'. As humans we may have been taught 'good' from 'bad' in decision making, but nobody told us that we have to choose good in every decision we make. Alex chooses what he wishes because he has free will. Once free-will to choose good or bad is taken away and no longer able to choose your choices, there is no option, no freedom within society. Alex's obsession with being violent, aggressive, and sexual is rebounded with internal pain and suffering until those obsessions have departed from his cognitions.<br/><br/>Society gives us choices, having us choose from one or the other, or many others. Once society takes this away, our freedom, choice and accountability are no longer available. Would this make us all the same, walking around and doing things just like everybody else? Having no say in decisions or opinions? Looking human on the outside, but on the inside becoming automatic, contrived and fixed? Turning us into clockwork oranges?"

"JohnnyR","8","0","2","30 October 2005"," Kubrick's finest
","Kubrick had this film withdrawn in the UK and it wasn't released again until his death. Its unavailability gave it a certain notoriety and I was pretty curious about seeing it when it finally did come out again. I also experienced this curiosity before I saw the likes of Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Straw Dogs, which were unavailable on video until UK film laws were relaxed a few years ago. However, those films were big disappointments to me when I actually saw them - Clockwork Orange wasn't. I like most of Kubrick's films but I think this is his best. The production design and cinematography are typically excellent, the soundtrack works well, the acting is generally fine (Malcolm McDowell is outstanding in the lead role) and it's a good story. Despite some of the 70's fashions on display, the film has dated very well and has a certain timelessness to it. I can't think of many films set in Britain that are better than this."
"El Guapo-2","10","0","2","27 October 2005"," When Kubrick banned the film in England, he basically confirmed that nobody *got it*
","The idea that films are really about other films, that films ""fold"" the ideas from other films into the story much like you fold bell peppers into a plain omelet to make it more interesting, is not an original one. However, it is an idea that I have stumbled across, or perhaps I knew it all along subconsciously, I just didn't have the reference to make the connection.<br/><br/>Films are essentially about other films, but life can be about films. For example, it is well known that thugs don't feel like a thug unless they affect some kind of film clichÃ©. DePalma's ""Scarface"" didn't really become popular until it was released on VHS and every gangster wanna be was buying a copy of it, and quoting the films dialogue to no end.<br/><br/>I do get the sense here that Kubrick is trying to make the audience connect to the idea that while films do not cause people to be violent, they can influence people to become violent. The entire movie works on several layers: The gangs wear costumes, Alex's gang fights another gang on a stage, Alex picks up a couple of groupies with a ""performance"" and the sex scene is shown in an exaggerated fashion (like most movie sex scenes are), the writer who gets beaten is the author of the story (the guy who wrote the book was in Ceylon, I think, when several American GI's broke into his home, beat him, and raped/murdered his wife).<br/><br/>How do they attempt to ""cure"" Alex? They show him a movie! Albeit, they force him to watch it, but they have also drugged him to associate a visceral reaction with Beethoven and the images. And this is what filmmakers do to us as well. It took my own maturity to finally comprehend some of these ideas, but in college, and looking back much to my chagrin, I watched this movie repeatedly because I thought it was a wicked black comedy. There is nothing funny about this movie, aside from a couple of winks from Kubrick. I think he is trying to put across the idea that movies can condition an audience to think/feel a certain way, and the results are not always for the best.<br/><br/>Violence is never ""cool"" despite Hollywood throwing mind-numbing amounts of violence at us every year. ""We"" are Alex, in a nut-shell. We, well maybe not you and I, but vast numbers of children are being conditioned to behave a certain way, think a certain way, talk a certain way. Maybe not in the fashion of Alex, who is forced to watch with his eyelids stapled open, but how many times have you seen a child sit 3 feet from a TeeVee set, tuned out like a zombie?"

The story steals from many classics of the same nature, that is of a controlling future, and has so much of 1984 in it that I'm surprised it was made in the first place, it's almost a remake. The screenplay is good, the dialogue is sometimes clunky, but the way the scenes are put together is very good. The acting is amazing, Malcolm McDowell and others are fantastic. The direction is good, Kubricks worst direction but not that bad. The visual effects are fair, so much of it looks fake by todays standards, but is so great by the standards of the early seventies.

A mixture of Beehtoven's finest music, Kubrick's finest novel choosing and, last but not least, Kubrick's magic, unreal but breathtaking touch were hitting my eyes, maybe too much of a good-strong, picture for my eyes and my brain. Malcolm McDowell gives us an excellent interpretation of the rare, crazy Ludwig Van lover Alex. This is a classic and probably the best movie I've ever seen, nonetheless I wouldn't recommend this movie to any person unless I know they are old or mature enough to see it. The ultra-violence is nothing to be censored or rated, but yes the raping scenes.

But I am so very glad I did. This film is a true reflection on modern society, and the kind of corruption that goes on in it. Malcom McDowell plays the role brilliantly, I don't think the film could have been nearly as convincing had he not been playing the role of Alex. This film is quite warped, but it makes you look at modern life in a totally different way. Some of the violence can be disturbing at times, but I think this really adds to the atmosphere that Kubrick was trying to create. It took me watching the film quite a few times to properly understand the ending of the film, but each time I did, I fell in love more and more with it. The effects are simple in it, but it all adds to the atmosphere, and all the music used in it was superbly chosen, it all really adds tension and a sense of drama and mystery.<br/><br/>This film doesn't mess about, its message is very clear and direct, and I think there is where the genius of Kubrick lies. It's probably not a film for everyones taste, but if you look past the violence on the surface, it makes the meaning of the plot even more outstanding.<br/><br/>There isn't much else to say, other than watch it, and make your own mind up about it!"

As emotionally conventional as the R-Rated ""Saving Private Ryan"" may be, its opening D-day sequence would not have seen the light of day if the film had been released a quarter century earlier. Hence, young viewers seeking a thrill from ""A Clockwork Orange"" may be bitterly disappointed by the movie's tameness compared to the offerings of today.<br/><br/>However, for more sensitive viewers, ""A Clockwork Orange"" is still shocking because of its cold lack of empathy. The events of the film are told by the main character- Alex deLong- a teen of above-average intelligence, charm, and aggression. His emotional makeup lacks empathy for others and a sense of duty to society and fellow humans. He is as ruthless as he is capricious, cruel, and selfish. Yet he is likably good-humoured.<br/><br/>The society he lives in is one much like the America of today (And Britain of 1970)- a trash-littered concrete jungle defaced by graffiti, decay, and a sense of hopeless acquiescence. The totality of the society's moral bankruptcy becomes fully apparent only in the latter half of the film during and after Alex's ""Conversion"".<br/><br/>****************Spoilers begin******************<br/><br/>The film has two phases- the first depicting Alex's cruel coldness, and the second depicting the cruel coldness of the society that made him. progression from first to second phase occurs when he is imprisoned for murdering an old woman and tries to obtain early release by agreeing to participate in a new treatment process designed to render violent offenders harmless by conditioning them to be sickened by violent thoughts and acts. In what is a fairly famous scene in cinema, he is strapped in and forced to watch violent films while given drugs that induce feelings of nausea and despair. He emerges from treatment incapable of even contemplating violent acts without becoming acutely ill and is, thus, released as ""Cured""- thereby freeing up a desperately needed bed in a terribly overcrowded prison system.<br/><br/>Just like Alex, we see the society in which he lives actuated by calculating selfishness. It does not care that Alex is not actually cured of his pathology- they only care that he seems safe enough to release from prison- thus forestalling the day when a new prison must be constructed and staffed. Unsurprisingly, the Film universe ends up being more swift and sure in justice than the real one. Soon after Alex is released, both Alex and his society are punished for their selfish deeds- Alex is badly hurt when he is attacked and unable to defend himself. Those who made him that way are forced to de-condition him, provide medical care, and leave him at large so to limit the political fallout of their failed experiment.<br/><br/>***********End Spoilers*************<br/><br/>The use of a Russian-inspired slang by Alex and his fellow hoodlums (""droogs"") is incidental to the plot of the film. It was much more important in the original Anthony Burgess novel. I am not so sure what this slang achieved in the film. It certainly doesn't facilitate viewer efforts to follow the plot, however it's not much of an inhibition and DOES remind us that Alex is different from us and there's no reason to expect him to share our sensibilities. Though he's obviously an evildoer, his life experience is so different that we can't say that his personality was, inherently, evil or merely distorted by life experience in a cold and uncaring society. Of course, that sort of relativism won't do you any good if you stood between him and his next goal!<br/><br/>The film is, as is standard for a Stanly Kubrick film, well photographed and tightly edited. The film has a vitality that his later films lack and should be justly thought of a one of his greatest along with Doctor Strangelove. It is an excellent introduction to Kubrick and, simply put, good entertainment provided the viewer is not put off by the ""'70's"" influence in the music and settings. Malcom McDowell fans should see him put in one of his best performances ever as the lead character Alex. The ironic detachment common to Kubrick serves this film particularly well since it so accurately conveys the mindset of many of the film's chief characters- Alex as well as the bureaucrats who try to reshape him for their own convenience.<br/><br/>To me, the film is one of the greatest films I have ever seen (in the top 25) because it is so entertaining with it's well-photographed and well-edited action, witty and engaging dialogue, and, yet, it is an excellent and unsentimental study of the frightening consequences of a human society that is trying to live without morality or genuine compassion. Because of it's humor and detachment, the viewer is not emotionally overloaded by the terrible prospects set forth in the movie and can see plainly and without hysteria the similarities between the movie's fictional world and our own."
"StanleyStrangelove","Null","0","1","2 September 2005"," Important but very disturbing Kubrick film
","Master director Stanley Kubrick's dark film about a bleak future in England where gangs terrorize ordinary citizens and the government is corrupt to the core. Malcolm MacDowell as Alex the droog in one of the greatest movie villain roles ever created. He and his band of droogs cruise around doing the in and out and ultra-violence until Alex is caught and sent to prison. What follows is an absolute nightmare. The violence in Clockwork Orange was, and is by some, considered extreme. It's the way Kubrick films the scenes that gets under your skin. The movie itself is an indictment of violence but some people incorrectly read it as a glorification of violence in the character of Alex. He's just a victim of a ruined society. Personally, I think the film is a great film, and I love Kubrick, but I avoid watching Clockwork Orange after seeing it three times. The scene where Alex is bound in a straight jacket and is forced to watch images of war violence turns my stomach. Clockwork Orange is #41 on the AFI's 100 best films list."

","I don't know how many times I've watched it, the last time being yesterday night. It is certainly a piece of art by Kubrick. No one can criticize his talent. He still has a great impact on the art of cinema.<br/><br/>The totally fictional story being told in the movie is told like a fairytale so that it criticizes very different parts and structures of the society.<br/><br/>It shows how some actions can end up creating the violence in other people. It also shows how the modern society is getting an awkward prejudice to the youth.<br/><br/>Politics is as always one of the best topics of Kubrick to analyze. The political inability and stupidity in the movie as well as political games picture a world that is quite known to us.<br/><br/>Another movie by Kubrick that has all the plot line beneath the surface. I wish he could've lived 20 years more and left us more art pieces that we could watch in admiration over and over again."

A series of events lead him into trouble and he find himself in jail. very smart thinking by him gets him into a hospital where political tricks are trying to influence people by trying to prove that criminals can be treated medically.<br/><br/>the movie shows in a beautiful way the flaws and the true colors of the political system.<br/><br/>i cant say more, just go and see it if u have not.<br/><br/>brilliant"

","A Clockwork Orange changed me, when I was 16 I was at the video store and I saw it and my Mum says it was great, I was doubtful. I put ""A Clockwork Orange"" into the DVD player, the next few hours of my ""viddying"" changed my whole perspective on cinema. Malcolm McDowell is absolutely perfect for the role of Alex and as he says he was born to play Alex. At first I was totally thrown by the outlandish language and dress code of Alex's gang of droogs. In fact the entire cast was perfect from Michael Bates as the Chief guard to Philip Stone as Alex's Father. Stanley Kubrick is a god and everyone who wants to direct a movie should bow down to him, and we should all try to phase out appalling movies like XXX, The Fast and the Furious and Van Helsing (yuck)"
"welchdk","10","0","2","12 August 2005"," A True Masterpiece
","I think this may be the greatest movie ever made. The combination of Burgess, Kubrick and Walter Carlos made this one of those rare cinematic achievements where everything clicked perfectly. It was truly groundbreaking. Although at times it is shocking and disturbing, it also has great humor and style. I was disappointed it was rated at about 35 on AFI's list of the greatest because I believe it deserves a place right alongside ""Citizen Kane"". Everything from the acting to the sets and cinematography was pure genius. It's a shame Mr. Kubrick didn't live longer so he give us more wonderful films. This one merits multiple viewings. It's timeless and sure to grow in stature over the years."

"tibor-brunt","10","0","2","3 August 2005"," Simply genius!
","This movie reigns as my most favorite movie now for more than 25 years... and the reason is simple: it's one of the most thought-provoking and bizarrely styled peaces of art in the whole cinematic history. It's so beyond its years that it also aged very little, and it's got one of the most thrilling soundtracks ever!! In the middle of pointless, gimmick-like and often stale productions throughout the last years this one will definitely catch any movie-lover's eye. I say that Malcolm McDowell's role in this movie is very much under-rated on the whole. He's as mean and scary as Nicholson in the shining, but at the same time as weak as William H. Macy in Fargo for instance. The point the movie makes is that there isn't a reason or motive for violence, it's simply inherent to some people (that enjoy it). But the point is largely overshadowed by the brilliant outlook of the scenes, and the Shakespeare-esquire dialogues that make the characters even more ambiguous. I would say this movie is a typical product of the coincidence of a brilliant director and a brilliant writer, which delivers the perfect movie! Watch in the dark..."
"SeminolePhenom","10","0","2","30 July 2005"," Absoulute epic masterpiece blending music and satire with insanity.
","Alex de Large(Malcolm McDowell) is the leader of four droogs who steel, rape, and fight for pleasure in a futuristic society. The spend every minute of their spare time causing absolute chaos anywhere they please. But after being challenged for his leadership, Alex puts his own droogs in their place by beating them. Wanting revenge for Alex's betrayal, the gang betrays Alex and leaves him for the police by whom he is told that he will be prosecuted for murder. Alex is sentenced for 14 years in prison, but after a while with good behavior, he is given the opportunity to get out early through an experiment that reforms criminals through brainwashing to be perfect citizens. Now, a totally reformed Alex must go back and face the society that he once terrorized as a human being with no free will.<br/><br/>What amazed me most about the movie, was the classical music that was played throughout horrific violent acts that Alex committed, showing that his violence was in nature. The music assisted the idea that he was a criminal at heart and he doesn't want to change. With the movie originally being rated X, you can probably guess that the criminal acts are very graphic. But that it was makes the movie even more brilliant. It doesn't hesitate to show the viewers every aspect of brutal fight scenes or disgusting rape visuals. Every detail adds to the idea that he is a sinner, plain and simple.<br/><br/>The acting also amazed me. Malcolm McDowell did a masterful job at his character's changes throughout the movie. The mood changes throughout the movie also. When Alex is ""allowed"" to be sinister, the mood is dark but yet happy. But when he is forced to be good(either in prison or after the reformation) the mood turns very dark and you can see Alex's unhappiness at what he has become. The movie shows very strong opinionated themes:Society cannot forgive other's sins and criminals are naturally evil and cannot be reformed. Disagree with this you may, but you have to respect the epic masterpiece that is A Clockwork Orange.<br/><br/>Overall,the movie is completely flawless and is everything it was meant to be and more. The idea of a criminal being transformed into being the idol citizen was captured brilliantly, through the graphic genius of Stanley Kubrick. It is one of the greatest of all time and one of my personal Top Ten greatest of all time.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie."
"LoneWolfAndCub","10","0","2","22 July 2005"," Weird, Disturbing, But Still A Masterpiece
","Stanley Kubrick's 'A Clockwork Orange' is a very odd movie, it may seem extremely twisted and sick and a terrible movie. It is most definitely not. Not everyone will have seen it, but many will know the reputation it has gathered.<br/><br/>Alex (Malcom McDowell) is the leader of his little gang. His hobbies include rape, ultra-violence, drugs and Beethoven. In other words, he is a very disturbed individual. But when he is caught by the police he wants to change to get out of prison. He applies for a controversial treatment to cure him of his need for violence and rape.<br/><br/>This movie is one of my favorites but for some it wouldn't be easy to watch. There is a lot of nudity, a rape and a few sex scenes. Not to mention, ultra-violence (but by today's standards it isn't too bad). But it is a classic nonetheless. Stanley Kubrick does an outstanding job of directing and the acting is fine all around, especially McDowell's performance as Alex. The soundtrack is very good, the opening theme is suitably unsettling and there is a lot of Beethoven (which I love).<br/><br/>The movie, even though it might seem aged, should not be seen as a mere violent movie with sex. It is much more, it has actual meaning and morals, brought to screen by Kubrick and McDowell with skill. It is a movie that not all will love, but it's definitely worth the 2 and a bit hours.<br/><br/>5/5"

","After summing up the courage to finally view this notoriously dark, disturbed but also acclaimed film I purchased it from HMV thinking to myself and informing others that I will only watch the film when i am mentally prepared. <br/><br/>After around the first half an hour I found myself totally immersed in the film but not shocked. The intentions of the gang are shocking and cruel but the aged portrayal for todays much hardier audience has become quite tame; and this film was banned?<br/><br/>Never the less, Malcolm McDowell's portrayal of the evil yet childish Alex and the superb language used, ""bit of the old in out, in out"" is inspiring.<br/><br/>This film was coveted for its violence but the main focus should be its image and style, go and see it, looks can be deceiving."

Considering that this movie dates on 1971;shows the vision of the world as if it were nowadays in the 2000's.Pulp Fiction and some other so-called - violent movies, should thank Kubricks work.

","It's weird how a movie can look so modern and fresh even tough it was made in 1971. Not many movies can do the same.<br/><br/>A Clockwork Orange tells a tale of a man, who isn't exactly a nice lad: He rapes, steals, fights and kills. No need to moralize, he's not a hero, there are no heroes or heroines in the film, the movie just tells about him and what happens to him in the society. <br/><br/>So Alex (Malcolm McDowell) leads his gang of droogs and spends time in a Milk Bar (not drinking exactly regular milk, mind you) plotting out for things to do. But so it happens, that Alex gets caught and is imprisoned. Soon he's taken for a guinea-pig in an experiment to brainwash criminal behavior out from his mind. Every time Alex is thinking anything criminal he's punished with pain. <br/><br/>But what happens to man, when his right to make decision, no matter how bad they would be, is taken from him? This is the question Stanley Kubrick so masterfully examines in his cinematic essay. To get in the end of this movie is actually surprisingly easy, because of the unique visuals and dialogue: Everything flows forward like a dream, but everything has a meaning and a purpose.<br/><br/>Watch it once, twice as many times you want, you'll always find something new from it."
"bryan_nixon79","10","0","2","5 July 2005"," Stanley Kubrik's masterpiece works like clockwork
","A Clockwork Orange is one of my top 5 favorite movies of all time. It is my favorite film by Stanley Kubrik, who I believe, along with Martin Scorsese, is the greatest director ever. Full Metal Jacket, The Shining, Eyes Wide Shut, 2001, and Dr. Strangelove are some of the best of all time, for me anyway. I wish that Kubrik could have had the opportunity to direct Artificial Intelligence, but Spielberg's homage did just fine. Back to A Clockwork Orange. This film is painful to watch on many levels. It is violent, but that is the subject matter. Due to that, this film is not for everyone. The soundtrack adds so much depth. The opening shot is planted in my brain, which is a closeup of Alex's face in the milk bar that features eerie music that fits so wonderfully. I do not want to describe the plot, because many others have and I do not want to give anything away. I do, however, want to write about my interpretation of the scene in which Alex is being ""treated"" in the movie theater by scientists who are trying to forcefully remove the evil from within his mind and heart. In the scene, they strap Alex down in a chair and hold his eyes open, so that he can not blink or look away from the screen. While he is strapped down, he watches footage of violence, rape, and war. In a way, this scene describes what the movie does to the viewer. When watching this film, it is impossible to look away, no matter how far it goes. The violence is not stylish or exciting. Instead, it is painful, brutal, hateful, and violent. Kubrik made this film to turn audiences off by violence. In today's world, violence seems to be the key to the success of a film. Just look at The Matrix or Kill Bill (I love both of these films by the way). I believe that Kubrik's mission was the same as the scientists, which was to scare the evil out of you. At least, that is what the film did to me. You know what I'm saying? If you have not seen this movie, I highly recommend it. Art does not get much better than this. It's a shame that the movie is loved by younger audiences due to the fact that they find the violence to be hilarious. They have it all wrong."

","Anthony Burgess book of the same name is really the rarest of gems in English letters; The philosophical novel. The main character is the near futuristic street thug Alex, played in director Stanley Kubrick's ultra violent screen adaptation by Malcolm McDowell. Who brings a priceless and vicious vigor to the roll which is almost impossible to top. Alex and his gang of 'Droogs' wreak havoc on 21st century London, as they rape, rob and rampage throughout the early scenes of the film and novel alike. Both stories following each other very closely with just a few minor changes. But when Alex is betrayed by one of his traitorous droogs after giving him a thorough 'Tollchocking' He finds himself holding the bag for a burglary gone awry. Which turns into the bludgeoning death of an elderly cat lover. With a long and frightful arrest record Alex finally lands in prison. Where he sets out to convince the in house Chaplin and anyone else who'll listen that he is reformed and ready to rejoin society. And when a radical new treatment becomes available to one lucky inmate. A therapy which can be completed in a mere two weeks. Alex considers himself the perfect candidate to be revamped and released in a fortnight's time. Not realizing that he will become 'A Clockwork Orange.' When Kubrick previewed his film for critics and audiences alike. People were stunned by what they saw. And whether or not you liked it or hated it one thing was for sure. No one had ever seen anything like it. The 'Ultra violence' is amply gratuitous and the rape scenes are harrowing, especially for the era that only immediately followed the sexual revolution. It's hard to imagine that Kubrick got the code and ratings administration to slap an R rating on there. Actually the film was originally hung with an X rating and it only after Kubrick revamped the editing, which included speeding up some scenes which were downright pornographic that he was able to get the labeling changed to an R rating. The dialogue is similar to the dialect which Burgess employed in his brilliant novel. Which is Alex's own mix of Russian, street slang and the regular King's English. Hearing McDowell speak these lines with wit and vinegar is very satisfying. His performance is a special accomplishment. I'm sure he brought more terror and life to this persona than even Burgess, who was also an accomplished conductor and writer of classical music, dared dream. And Kubrick isn't too bad himself. No one had ever even attempted to make a film this daring up to that date. And whether you gather the moral implications or not. There's not one scene that wouldn't entertain as it's own entity. With the engrossing and fascinating McDowell leading the way in almost every frame. Many have called Kubrick the greatest film maker of all time. Including, among others, the not too shabby himself Martin Scorsese. And after watching 'A Clockwork Orange' and being thrilled by it for the umpteenth time. I can find no avenue to disagree. This film is spectacular reel after reel. Do yourself the favor of seeing it for yourself. 10 out of a possible 10. T.H."
"mattm89","9","0","2","1 July 2005"," A good movie....if you can handle it
","Stanley Kubrick has created what some may call a masterpiece, and others may simply call trash with A Clockwork Orange. Personally, I thought that it was a good movie, but certainly only for mature audiences. It was originally rated ""X"", and I honestly don't know how even the re-edit that I saw got down to an ""R"" rating. The movie is about a group of young hoodlums whose main sources of fun are Beethoven, rape, and murder. After drinking some apparently drug-laced milk at a milk-bar the four men go out for a ""bit of the ultra violence"" as they put it, as they beat an old bum, and rape a few women. After one particular altercation where he had to break into a home (He usually knocks on the door saying that his friend was in a horrible car accident and gains entrance that way) he kills a woman with a statue of a penis (yes you read correctly) and as he tries to escape from the police, his friends, and fellow gang members break a bottle off of his head and take off, leaving him there to be caught. He is taken to jail but learns of a new experimental treatment that will release him from jail sooner, and also cure him of his addiction to murder and rape. He goes through the procedure (I wont give away details but it certainly isn't for the faint of heart)and is released from prison. After getting kicked out of his parents house he wonders the streets until he finds a house that will let him in and let's just say that he has seen the house owner before. I'm not going to give away any more of the movie, that is for you to watch and find out.<br/><br/>Overall, I gave this movie a 9/10 it is a very good movie, but only if you like this type of movie and can stomach the ultra violence, blatant nudity, and other adult themes.<br/><br/>Some of the best parts of the movie are just listening to their slang... some of it is hilarious."
"KUAlum26","10","0","2","29 June 2005"," Book compliments movie,and vice-versa
","This Stanley Kubrick adaptation of Anthony Burgess' 1963 novel is something of a revelation of movie-making. It is truly very European in its make-up:the hero of the film is hardly an exemplary figure and the situations are dreary and morally difficult to make absolute. In other words,this is probably not the kind of film you'd find Michael Medved recommending.<br/><br/>Alex(a young Malcolm MacDowall,Sting look-alike)and his cronies--his ""droogs""--spend an average evening in bars drinking a milk-based narcotic that makes them more rowdy and violent. On one particular evening,they kick the snot out of a homeless man,get in a fight with a rival gang of droogs and end up pillaging and raping a rich old man and his young wife in his mansion.<br/><br/>On another evening,Alex and his mates decide they'll try to rob a little old lady in her apartment. When the burglary goes awry,his mates abandon him and he ends up killing the woman,Alex is arrested and taken away to prison. <br/><br/>From there,he learns to become a ""model prisoner"" in order to get fast-tracked for a form of prisoner medical experimentation. Little does he realize(until it's too late)that the experimentation that he's been sold on,to ""cure"" his violent urges,is a draconian and brutal form of mental reprogramming involving mind-altering drugs and forced film-viewing.<br/><br/>Once released back into the world,Alex may no longer be violent,but that proves of absolutely no help to him as he tries to quietly reenter the society.<br/><br/>The book is a little harder to digest,but still is brilliantly written,so this movie actually gives flesh to the images and ideas created in it. I liken that to ""American Psycho"",only in that case I found the movie actually an IMPROVEMENT over the book. Kubrick seems very much at home with this grim,futuristic cautionary tale. It dovetails nicely with the film he did previously,a little experimental ditty called ""2001:A Space Odyssey"",also set in the future but comparatively sterile and detached when contrasted to ""Clockwork"". MacDowall,who rarely(if ever)commands leading roles anymore,is superb as the lead character,who is detestable,lovable,pathetic and sympathetic ALL in the same film. Not necessarily a must-see,but a deserved memorable offering at that."
"daniel-billings","10","0","2","26 June 2005"," Far ahead of its time
","Aside from its terrifying vision of a lawless future driven by a sociopathic addiction to ""ultra- violence"", this movie makes some astounding statements about the lengths governments are willing to take to reassert their control over society. The violence in this movie is so overblown that its impossible to believe - the point of it is to make us consider where urban society is moving and how morality has changed in the minds of future young people. The fact that Alex is so obsessed with Beethoven ties him to classical Western ideals, but he uses the music to get pumped up for a night out with friends, raping and murdering the elders he has no need to respect.<br/><br/>But things get really interesting once the Brits decide to forcibly change Alex's ultra-violent desires. He reenters society unable to cope with the violence he was a product of, and takes refuge at the very home of a former victim. The dramatic irony at the end couldn't be better. When the government realizes that their new celebrity almost killed himself because of their treatment, they protect Alex and indict the victim. While the viewer finds some poetic justice in Alex's brutal treatment by the man he put in a wheelchair, the government can't make him look like anything other than a success story... Alex is the ultimate winner. <br/><br/>I don't know how much credit to give to Anthony Burgess or Kubrick, but the whole concept of this film is striking. Out of control kids, an insane treatment for morality, and the complete abandonment of ethics in the name of ""reducing crime"" are problems we face today. This movie is about the future and what we could resort to if need be - the bigger problem it attacks is how to shape an ethical society in the modern world. Religion isn't the answer anymore."

","This movie is very disturbing and tough. When I read through many user reviews about this movie, I was sad that they liked it for the wrong reason. This movie is not about glorifying bullies, it is not about showing funny in-out scenes. I feel it is all about the brain-wash one goes through while watching the movie. <br/><br/>The important thing in the movie is about choice. You cannot convert a person to good, if you don't teach him what is good. You have to expose them to both Good and Evil, and give them a choice to Pick the Good from Evil. The movie starts of with our 'Brother' Alex raping women, beating up friends and foes with sinister glee. Not everybody likes to be beaten up. Crime begets crime, and he finds himself in Prison, thanks to his equally bad buddies. <br/><br/>He exchanges his prison term for a Brainwash treatment, and loses his ability to enjoy the evil deeds he always liked. They now made him wish for a painless silent death. He has no choice, but to be good.

","Without question this is Malcolm McDowell's great performance of a lifetime and should have won a Best Actor at the Academy Awards. His incredible facial smirks run the gamut from viciousness to sarcasm to sexual enticement to pathos - ALL with superb humor. I've viddied this movie often and me glassies never get tired of watching the comedy which gave me a warm feeling all through me guttywuts. ""The Durango 95 purred away real horrorshow."" Kharosho is Russian for good. And this movie is real horrorshow. There is a mixture of Russian, English slang and just made up words but easy to understand because of the contents in each sentence as the author Anthony Burgess was a linguist and must have had a ton of fun writing this masterpiece. McDowell's Character Alex is a murderous thug of a malchick (young man) and a rapist who likes a bit of Ludwig van - especially the glorious 9th Symphony - with which to ""get off"" on. In the book he masturbated to Beethoven's 5th Symphony but in this movie he was turned on by the 9th. Alex liked to have sex and with two young devochke he seduced he seemed organic yet it was to a very fast William Tell Overture that was very mechanical. He was also a rapist who indeed only went through the motions of sex mechanically. Alex was mechanical in his idea of sex yet appeared to be organic as any normal man would enjoy sex hence he was a clockwork orange. This movie has so much more violence than I realized upon the second time I viddied it (the weepy devochke that I viddied it with slid down her chair and closed her glassies during all of the ultra violence as my rasoodoc understood how much violence there really was) however the comedy just made me giggle through most of it after a while. The prison chief's (Michael Bates who played Field Marshal Montgomery in Patton) expressions and histrionics had me rolling in the aisles from laughter. Every scene if you can get by the violence is so funny that you will get a hernia from laughter. It's very weird that way like when Alex is kicking Patrick Magee he is singing Singing in the Rain just before he gets set to perform the old in/out in/out on a weepy devochke or his ""It's a sin!"" speech while his eyelids are clamped open or while he and his droogs (friends) are rumbling with Billy Boy and his droogs the rumble is choreographed to Rossini's The Thieving Magpie - ultra-violent but will tickle your guttywuts. After Alex pretends to smash some eggiwegs yet wasn't affected by the Ludoviko technique in that outburst you start to realize that just after he was unsuccessful at ""snuffing it"" he was on the road to recovery. I could write a book on A Clockwork Orange about all the myelenky (small) things that went into this movie that took Stanley Kubric at least two years to make. Suffice it to say that in its way it is every bit as good as 2001: A Space Odyssey and in some ways a little better though it's hard to compare. This movie received the most votes from an award that is arguably more prestigious than the Academy Awards - The New York Film Critics Award - ten out of fifteen votes makes it real savage!! Make up your rasoodoc now to viddie A Clockwork Orange. Viddie well oh my brothers. Viddie well."

"lyndzamabob","10","0","2","11 March 2005"," This highly controversial and also highly enjoyable piece of 70's artwork both revolts, attracts and connects to me, and I'm sure many others out there.
","This masterpiece entered my 'list of things to do' while watching a film countdown on Channel 4 a few months ago. From then on I was impelled to watch this infamous film banned to me, being 14 years of age. I experienced a rush of joy when I realised a close friend at school had a VHS copy in their possession, and she lent it to me the next day.<br/><br/>Like a child with a new toy, I could not wait to get home in order to watch this long-awaited movie, and I was not disappointed.<br/><br/>I am hard to surprise and shock, but the pace of this film did indeed surprise me. For me, the most memorable part of it was near the beginning, where the character of Alexander DeLarge, played by the fabulous Malcolm McDowell ( and in my crazy opinion, simply sumptuous in his younger years ) is woken up by his PVC and nylon clad mother, after a hard night out containing the usual - ultra violence and 'the old in-out, in-out' - and it is revealed to the audience that this assumed twenty-something man is actually a boy of 15, younger then the films certificate, and only one year older than myself. After this early morning arousal, Alex sleeps some more then, in his waken state, is called upon by a confusing character of some significant importance. This leering man, I assume to be a Police or truant officer of some sort, then proceeds to interrogate Alex, in his underpants on his parents' bed, then grabs his testicles in what I am sure would not be classes as orthodox, even then. The homosexual tendencies of this toe-curling character are fully displayed and explored in this scene.<br/><br/>For me, the two reasons why this film is one of the best of all time, are thus. Firstly, the incredible use of imagery, music and language. Stanley Kubrick, genius director, chose the most repulsive outfits for Alex and his 'droogs' for while they were out on the town: sterile looking white overalls and a giant fake penis worn as over pants, whereas a rival gang (named Billy Bob and his droogs) wore pirate outfits, giving them a more unclean and savage look. These types of costume gave the feeling of a cult following similar to that of the Ku Klux Klan. The music chosen gives a whole new slant to classical music: I will never be able to hear Ludwig Van's 9th symphony without thinking of Alex and his adventures with the world. It is haunting, perfect, strangely tech-no-sounding and modern when put in this context. Also, 'Singin' in the rain' is placed in a very obscure situation and becomes a classic all over again. The language for me is pleasing: it shows that maybe the most vicious of our criminals are well-spoken and have no need to swear. The sheer lack of f-word and partners should be a signal to other directors to show that criminals seem all the more absorbing, memorable and real when anything other than the normal street talk is used in their language.<br/><br/>Also, the very fact that this wonderment is banned from UK terrestrial networks is enough to make me think."

","""A Clockwork Orange"" is, despite what everybody in the world has told you, despite what the AFI thinks, despite what the New York Times says, despite what all those 250 Best, 150 Best, 100 Best lists say, A BAD MOVIE.<br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick was a great and original director.His ""2001"" and ""Dr.Strangelove"" are among the best films ever made.From the others I have seen, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" and ""Full Metal Jacket"" were flawed but still very much worthwhile.Even ""Spartacus"" had its moments. Kubrick only directed sixteen movies in his lifetime but not one was uninteresting, worthless or mindless.Except for ""A Clockwork Orange"".<br/><br/>Number One, it's mechanical and boring.It's such a bland and colorless adaptation of the book.The film follows the book nearly word for word; it doesn't flow, it marches from page to page.<br/><br/>Number Two,it's cruel and morally repugnant.The movie doesn't know that its sick and sadistic hero, Alex, is not supposed to be a sympathetic character (or maybe he is. Who knows. The book was ambivalent, first describing his horrific crimes and then turning him into a victim and object of pity.)However, the movie is pretty clearly on Alex's side.At the end, when he survives a suicide attempt, can rape and kill again and collaborates with the criminal government, it's like we are expected to cheer.<br/><br/>One thing always bothered me about ""A Clockwork Orange"", the book and movie; what in God's name is the message, the great underlying idea? It's obvious the author is trying to make some sort of metaphysical point, but what the hell is it? A lot of graphic violence and scenes of rape are employed, but to prove what? As the American film critic Roger Ebert once said, I don't require ideas in movies,in order to be great a movie doesn't at all need to have a message-but in a message movie, I'd sure like to know what the message is."

","This is one of my all time favorite movies.The first time I saw this film I couldn't grasp all the Shakespearian language,but I still was fascinated.The opening scene with little Alex and his pals chilling out and a local lounge getting ready for a night of ultra-violence is one of the most powerful scenes I have witnessed.The direction & the sound along with sinister look on Alex's(Malcom McDowell) face had me mesmerized & I went along for a two hour journey. The story basically tells you the story of a young dude named Alex who is as sick & depraved as any serial killer produced on this planet.There is a consequence for his actions which is strange & compelling rolled up in one. There are some brutal rape scenes along with violence that might not be for everybody,but you'll probably be glued to your seat. Malcom McDowell is brilliant in this movie,but outside of Gangster No.1, he has lite up some stink bombs in movies like Tank Girl,Milk Money,& Class of 99 but no one's perfect.The prison guard with the Hitler mustache stuck out for me.

","Without a doubt, the greatest movie ever made. Kubrick got everything right in this film. From the social commentaries, to the in your face violence, to the Love Story (or the lack there of), to the Music... ""...all we needed now to end the perfect evening, was a little of the old, Ludwig Van..."" From the opening scene of panning in on Alex at the Kirdova Milk bar...to the fight scene with the William Tell Overature in the background...pure brilliance. The fact that Kubrick doesn't lose interest with flaky and often unneeded love stories is another selling point...the only love story is Alex and his Ultra-Violence. I highly recommend this film...not only for Kubrick's interesting look into the future, but for a good chuckle here and there, and of course for bits of the old 'Ultra Violence'. Look past the violence and see the film for what it is...a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Keep on Rockin'!"
"egoldman45","10","0","1","11 February 2005"," Behavioral conditioning is unacceptable
","Behaviorist B.F. Skinner's book 1971 book ""Beyond Freedom and Dignity"" was controversial. Stanley Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange"" is a great answer to Skinner, and a stunning accomplishment.<br/><br/>Briefly, Skinner argued that man is the product of behavioral forces and influences whether or not man consciously likes or approves; therefore, why not accept this, and use it to mold a ""technology of behavior"" which would be consistent with generally agreed social values (including, for example, repudiation of coercion as a behavioral tool). This ""technology of behavior"" would replace the socially inadequate (and undirected) processes which now exist; without such a technology, Skinner argues, man as a species may not be equipped to meet critical problems in the future, problems exacerbated by current scientific and technological progress.<br/><br/>Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange"" argues that a technology of behavior simply won't be accepted in principle, regardless of whether or not it is a good idea. Set at some point in the future -- perhaps 50 or 100 years -- the film tells the story of Alex, a young delinquent who roves the streets with his gang. He is caught, sent to prison, and given a treatment to cure his aggressive impulses. After the treatment, he is unable to either defend himself physically, respond sexually, or listen to his formerly favorite music, Beethoven's Ninth Symphony (an inadvertent side effect of the treatment, since the background score during his reconditioning was a pop version of the Ninth). Significantly, the fourth movement of the Ninth contains Beethoven's setting of a Schiller poem titled ""Ode to Joy."" Released, Alex is very much adrift; after a suicide attempt, he recuperates to the point where he finds himself able to listen to the Ninth, and, at the same time, have a sexual fantasy. Left unanswered is whether Alex's criminal inclinations have also reverted.<br/><br/>The violence inflicted by Alex and his gang at the beginning of the film is so extreme and merciless, that the (normal) viewer is bound to be revolted by it all. Therefore, it is a peculiarly brilliant and perverse twist that Kubrick manages to make us feel it a triumph when Alex overcomes his reconditioning at the end. By setting up such an extreme situation, where virtually everyone in the audience would condemn Alex's activities, Kubrick has placed the issue of free will versus behavioral conditioning in the forefront. There are no mitigating circumstances in Alex's behavior to confuse us morally; if ever anyone should be reconditioned, Alex is the candidate. Thus, what a shock to discover in ourselves the feeling that even if Alex becomes a criminal again, it would be preferable. That's why Kubrick left the question of Alex's criminality unanswered at the end. We answer it for him, and that's even more disturbing than the passive experience of seeing it depicted on the screen. It is not only Alex's will which resists reconditioning -- it is our own.<br/><br/>In all of this, Kubrick carefully assumes a morally neutral posture. He is not arguing the merits of behavioral reconditioning so much as the possibility of accomplishing it at all, given human nature. It should be noted here, however, that Skinner emphasizes positive reinforcement, whereas the reconditioning in ""A Clockwork Orange"" involves negative reinforcement. Skinnerians would argue that Clockwork's reconditioning was just a bad job, and that's why the viewer rejects it in principle.<br/><br/>As in his other films, Kubrick again proves himself to be a master of extrapolation. Artistically, he is drawn to extreme situations, to circumstances and settings so polarized so that the issues or themes are especially clearly defined. ""Paths of Glory"" examined a suicidal attack order by the French in WWI; ""Spartacus"" dealt with a desperate slave revolt; ""Lolita"" with Humbert Humbert's obsession with his nymphet; ""Dr. Strangelove"" with the absurd and insane prospect of nuclear war; and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" with the evolution of a future ""superman."" In the latter, Kubrick created the future by meticulous technological detail, by extension from what exists in the present. In ""A Clockwork Orange"" he applies the same principle, only instead of extrapolating from technology, he extrapolates from current value systems and trends in human interaction. There is little reliance on extraneous visual paraphernalia; the future is evoked by the social climate, by shifts in the way people act and react to various situations. Nevertheless, these actions are recognizable, for they are in fact extensions or exaggerations of elements which exist in the present. That's why we believe in the settings which Kubrick creates, in a way that we could never believe in, say, ""Barbarella"" or ""Flash Gordon"". For Kubrick, the emphasis in science fiction is on the fiction, not the science. He uses future settings as a convenient tool to create his art, not simply as an exercise for the imagination.<br/><br/>At times, ""A Clockwork Orange"" seems to broach upon the subliminal, though never quite strays in. For example, after his treatment and release, Alex meets in succession all the characters he'd abused in the first part of the film -- and they proceed to pay him back with interest. These encounters are too much to be explained as coincidences -- there's design in this, the kind of design which is usually attributed to dreams.<br/><br/>Because of this borderline level of consciousness, as well as Alex's personality, ""A Clockwork Orange"" invites comparison to Fellini's ""Satyricon"". In both films, the protagonists start out as hedonistic, corrupt youths, and in both, they undergo changes. But a major difference between the two films is that Satyricon's protagonist grows and changes voluntarily, as a result of his experiences, whereas Alex is changed by means of reconditioning -- and then reverts. Taken together, these two films complement each other over a broad spectrum of personality development: one, a trip into a hedonistic past, the other, into a hedonistic future; both examine good and evil, growth and change, and the processes by which these may or may not occur."
"mac301","7","0","1","3 February 2005"," One of The Best Film's Ever Made!
","The Story<br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick's dystopian masterpiece is set in the near future where urban thugs run wild and new methods of crime deterrence are being explored. Career gang member Alex (Malcolm McDowell) is nabbed by the police and offered the chance to a commuted sentence if he undergoes a kind of surgical therapy. One where his brain does not allow him to execute his violent urges.<br/><br/>What is A Clockwork Orange?<br/><br/>a clockwork (mechanical, artificial, robotic) human being (orange - similar to orang-utan, a hairy ape-like creature), and the Cockney phrase from East London, ""as queer as a clockwork orange"" - indicating something bizarre internally, but appearing natural, human, and normal on the surface<br/><br/>The Facts<br/><br/>A Clockwork Orange was released in 1971. It was made for around 2,000,000 dollars and pulled in around 26,000,000 dollars at the box office. I believe it originally got an ""X"" rating. If I'm not mistaken it was one of two movies to get an original ""X"" rating and get nominated for best picture at The Academy Awards. The film was banned in the UK until 1999 when Stanley Kubrick, the director, died. I think he got death threats from the film's release in the UK so he decided not to have it released there until he died. In 1973 it was released with an ""R"" rating. In my opinion A Clockwork Orange is one of the best films ever made. I loved it the first time that I saw it. That may mean that I'm really screwed up or that I have decent taste in movies. A Clockwork Orange is based on a novel by Anthony Burgess that I have not read. It was released in 1962 if I'm not mistaken. The book as well as the film was controversial in it's original release. To me, A Clockwork Orange is one big piece of art. I'm not sure if it is just the direction or all the symbolism in the picture. I can see why some are turned off by the film but most enjoy it. This was the second Stanley Kubrick film I had seen. The first film I saw of his was The Shining. I saw it when I was nine or ten. It was made nine years after this picture. Stanley Kubrick has said that if Malcolm McDowell was not available he would probably not have even made this picture. Imagine a world with no Clockwork Orange. From all of the reviews I have read for this film everyone agrees that it is a good adaption of the book and very close to it. The main job of the film is to make us, as an audience, connect with the hoodlum Alex. In the beginning I was disgusted with him and despised him. Maybe I'm screwed up but by the end of the picture I care for him and, that is where Kubrick succeeds the most with this film. Kubrick's touch shines in this classic like a star. His artistic feel gives the film a unique and beautiful premise. All the acting is good. Malcolm McDowell is easily the best. No one could have portrayed Alex like him. The picture itself has lots of violence and nudity. At first it just disturbed me, but I grew with the premise and it did not bother me as much. If I were you I would watch it alone. You may get embarrassed easily if you watch it with others. At many times I felt like I was watching a horror picture, moreso at the beginning. I was scared for the victims and felt their terror. The soundtrack was really good. I would call it more of a score. It was perfectly unique just like the film itself. I now like Beethoveen or Ludwig Van way more than I ever thought I would. Every piece is perfect for each particular scene. I also liked Alex's rendition of ""Singing In The Rain"". He wasn't too bad. The film includes it's own language, Nadsat, which I found amusing at times and confusing at others. The first moment that I stopped hating Alex and started caring about his character was the scene in which he was released from prison and went home to find his belongings and room taken. I felt bad because he had gone through so much and went home where he thought he was loved to find nothing for him. He had to start all over. He should have thought about the consequences before he did his actions. What I loved about the film the most is how no matter how hard he tries to change he always has that evil inside him. He is ""A Clockwork Orange"". Make sure not to miss out on this fantastic classic that Stanley Kubrick did brilliantly."

However, this scene would be nothing if it wasn't for the music. It's so beautiful I can't think of anything else in the world while it's playing. It has to be the most beautiful piece of music ever written (after Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata). Funny enough, the greatest composer of all Time, Beethoven, is also a big part of the film.

","My family has always been scared/freaked out by the evil smirk Malcolm McDowell gives to the camera in this film's opening shot. Now that I've seen this movie, I get to freak them out whenever they serve milk as a beverage at holidays. :) Using stunning tracking shots, bizarre surrealism and just sheer drama, Stanley Kubrick created one of, if not the best movie of 1971. Now that that's been established, let's take a more in-depth look at this exceptionally deep film.<br/><br/>My first Kubrick film was 2001: A Space Odyssey when I was six. I understood most of it, but I just liked the visual effects. When I saw it again on DVD when I was 13, it was so much different. Since that day, I had wanted to see all of Kubrick's movies. A Clockwork Orange may just be his masterpiece.<br/><br/>Kubrick's tracking shots have always been the best of any director (Martin Scorcese is right behind). Using the trademark fish-eye lens, the screen follows characters from an inanimate third-person point of view. The record store scene in particular is a great example. Sometimes the scene will just stay still for so long, the tension becomes so unbearable because you just want the camera to move.<br/><br/>The acting is extraordinary, especially from British actor Malcolm McDowell. He is able to completely embody Alex de Large with startling and sometimes even scary ease. When I read the trivia section at IMDb before seeing this movie, I couldn't figure out why McDowell would have a fear of eye drops after making this. The ""conditioning"" scene explained to me why.<br/><br/>Anyway, this is a terrific film that mature audiences should all experience. If you are reading this review and haven't seen it, you really should. I can almost promise you (I can't promise you because I don't know you) that you will not be disappointed.<br/><br/>****/****<br/><br/>10/10"

"Ndirsch11","10","0","2","1 January 2005"," The Greatest Film Ever Made!
","What Stanley Kubrick accomplishes with A Clockwork Orange is simply beyond words. This film is number 1 on my favorite film list for an infinite number of reasons. First of all, the acting, screenplay, and direction are all top notch; the story is ambitious and brave; the film's use of classical music fits perfectly; and it leaves you with so much to think about. The key to the film's brilliance lies in its humor. The film contains extraordinarily dark subject matter yet seems lighthearted all the way through. I can't help but watch this film with a smile on my face because I know and understand that the film is trying to poke fun at society and the hypocrisy within our various institutions. That's what all great satire does and this is the greatest satire of them all. Notice such scenes as the nurse and the doctor having sex while Alex is waking up in the hospital, the cat lady with her obscene paintings and statues, the naive parents who don't suspect that their son is up to no good when he goes out at night. All of these things highlight the fact that ordinary, everyday people act much differently behind closed doors than they do in public. In fact, I believe that one of the main messages of the film is that we all in a sense have elements of Alex DeLarge's personality within our own personality. When we can't even acknowledge our own barbaric and disgusting drives then how can we even begin to think of solving such social problems as murder and rape? Many people make the mistake in thinking that the film is trying to justify Alex's crimes. Alex is not meant to be looked upon as a hero or a role model. He's a villain all the way through. But one must also notice how villainous all the other characters are too. Everyone in this movie is essentially a villain because they are all human, and subject to the same drives that drive Alex and his droogs to murder and rape out of boredom. The reason why I believe Stanley Kubrick to be the greatest director who ever lived and ever will live is his ability to depend on the audience's intelligence. All of his films are deliberately ambiguous because the audience is supposed to come to its own conclusions. What you put into a film is what you take away from it. Stanley Kubrick will be missed.

","A Clockwork Orange is no doubt a classical masterpiece which artistically employs themes such as good vs evil and free will vs indoctrination, followed by presenting them in a very dark manner, which may seem surreal to some, artistic to others and if you are like me, both. The aforementioned themes are presented in a dark manner because whilst presenting them in the movie, kubrick has made abundance use of coupling violence with sex, and has exploited several immoral ways to bring some fundamentally important issues to light. I did not know what to expect when I watched this movie, and when i did, I was intrigued. Therefore, I won't tell you what the movie is about because it is best to watch, not knowing what to expect (even to the most high level subjects such as ""main themes""). My advice to all you is to abstain from reading into the movie details before watching the movie and just rent it out like you would rent out an ordinary movie and watch it (preferably alone).

","Anybody who thinks ACO is a disgusting film and that Kubrick was merely trying to offend or shock really has a lot to learn about film, literature and the windows they can be upon society and the human heart. First, it was based upon the brilliant novel by Anthony Burgess; Stanley Kubrick did not create the story from whole cloth. Second, it is true that much of the violence in the film is shocking and disturbing. But to dismiss those scenes as simply showing violence for the sake of violence is to deny a fundamental truth of modern human society: horrific and sadistic violence and cruelty exist in it and we must confront that terrible truth if we are ever to truly know ourselves. By using violence Burgess and Kubrick were trying to convey something much more profound about the role of crime and punishment in the modern state, personal redemption and the importance of free will and moral choice in the individual (see my comments of Nov. 14th for a more detailed treatment of these themes). Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment and Tolstoy's War and Peace depict acts of horrific violence and wanton cruelty as well, yet we would not dismiss two of the greatest novels ever written as shock art or ""attention grabbers."" The fact is that ACO is one of the greatest, most fascinating and most important films ever made by one of the titanic directors of our time. It is impossible to look away: the beautifully lush still shots and pans, the hypnotic and perfectly placed haunting music, and the cold, bleak desolation of the modern totalitarian state intricately interwoven with Stanley's wonderfully black sense of humor. It is a masterpiece that will endure for all time. Violence and man's continuing inhumanity to his fellow man is a reality of modern human society. So too is the frightening power of the state to ostensibly correct such conditions in the name of the common good. Never before or since has a film portrayed these complex and difficult themes with more import or power."

","Clockwork Orange is a classic 'Stanley Kubrick' production, as its a film way ahead of its time. I admit this film was low budget, with disturbing scenes and the storyline/plot got cut in half from one extreme to the next, but I think what held this film together was its great acting, soundtrack, memorable scenes and its genius script/ dialogue for its Russian Lingo, Old-style Cockney accents and sophisticated (yet hip), Cult-Like London jargon, made this film a 'One of a kind'.<br/><br/>I can understand a person not liking this film (especially women), considering the rape and violence, but in order to appreciate this film, you've gotta look beyond that; By doing so, you'll need to watch this film at least twice in order to absorb the unique dialogue and Lingo (ie. If you want a motorcar - you pluck it from the trees and if you want pretty Polly - you take it) and of course its amazing memorable scenes. The scenes I love in this film are when Alex chatted up the two women in the record shop, when Alex was strait jacketed in the Institution (with his eyes held open), while watching the violent films, when Alex beat-up Georgie and cut open Dims hand at the canal (in Slow motion), when Alex wacked Dims lap, with his cane, in the milk-bar, after Dim mocked the ladies singing ! and several other scenes. However, these scenes wouldn't have been half as good as they were, without the brilliant soundtrack in the background. Another element of this film that I quite liked, were the subliminal (micro-second) camera shots that Stanley Kubrick hid within the film. This happened when Alex dropped the over-sized penis ornament on the catwomans head. If you haven't seen 'Clockwork Orange' and would like to, than go ahead and watch it. However, please concentrate on the external view of the film and not the internal view of it, as its the only way you'll appreciate watching it."

","In a film career distinguished by films of great style, this one is Kubrick's most brilliant, entertaining, and beautifully conceived. There is not a moment which feels dull or forced or unimaginative. Of course Kubrick had a great piece of literature to deal with. People may quibble with his ""retelling"" of ""Lolita"" or ""The Shining""--I don;t--but this film is so completely true to the spirit of the book, and so beautifully finds a cinematic equivalent of the writing style of the original--that it is truly amazing how he pulled it off. The moment the film begins--with that unbelievably spectacular film score using electronic versions of one famous<br/><br/>piece after another and the vision of that Korova Milk Bar that began, what in the 70's was a really shocking film, we are tossed into a world so vivid and so<br/><br/>imaginative. The moments of violence were practically unwatchable when it first came out (now of course we are desensitized to that........hmmmmmmm...was<br/><br/>this film somehow prophetic?). But these horrific scenes were balanced with<br/><br/>moments that were simply beautiful or really amusing or intriguing as could be. In addition to being an extremely ""artistic"" film, it also tells such a great and compelling story, and we get carried away with it. We somehow identify with<br/><br/>Alex. We are appalled and we feel guilty at the end as we hear those final ironic strains of ""Singing in the Rain"", and are so relieved that Alex is well and good-- that miserable rat bastard! How can this be? Kubrick has a field day<br/><br/>manipulating all of us. I think of any film I have ever seen (and I am a real film buff), this work made me think like none other."

","A Clockwork Orange is clearly one of the greatest and at the same time most disturbing and frightening films ever made. Its commentary on free will, morality, the human psyche, good versus evil and crime and punishment in modern society is as penetrating and relevant today as it was 33 years ago, but first about the title. In the words of Anthony Burgess himself in his new introduction to the novel entitled A CWO Resucked ""A human being is endowed with free will. He can use this to choose between good and evil. If he can only perform good or only perform evil, then he is a clockwork orange- meaning that he has the appearance of an organism lovely with colour and juice but is in fact only a clockwork toy to be wound up by God or the Devil or the Almighty State. It is as inhuman to be totally good as it is to be totally evil. The important thing is moral choice. Evil has to exist along with good, in order that moral choice may operate."" This is in essence the heart and crux of the film and book: free will and the ability to make moral choices are ultimately removed in Alex and he is left conditioned by the State an empty shell of a human being devoid of everything that makes us human. In the name of eliminating crime and violence the State has in effect created a condition that is arguably equally as inhuman as the violence that Alex and his droogs were perpetrating in the first place: a cold sterile society full of empty wooden waxen clockwork oranges. Kubrick brings this frightening moral landscape into sharp relief- the cold stark futuristic setting, the sadistic sickening violence and the searing image of our poor narrator strapped in and forced to watch films of horrific and unspeakable wanton carnage and carnality with a little of the old Ludwig van playing in the background. The theme of revenge and redemption is also a prevalent one in the story. The image of the mad obsessed writer of subversive literature taking his vengeance upon Alex at the end of the film is one of the most terrifying scenes I have seen on film. In the end, Burgess and Kubrick make it clear that a conditioning treatment such as the one performed on Alex is itself morally wrong and doomed to failure because it destroys free will and the human ability to think and act autonomously. Although it is disturbing and difficult for many people to sit through and watch, A Clockwork Orange is one of the most important films ever made for what it tells us about society and what it tells us about ourselves."

","A CLOCKWORK ORANGE (5 outta 5 stars)<br/><br/>One of the most wildly, imaginative and fascinating movies ever made.

Amazing performance by Malcolm McDowell (just look how long he is held underwater and beaten in one extended take!) The lead character of Alex is one of the most evil characters ever portrayed on film... and yet he also gains audience sympathy as the story progresses. I've always thought it incredible that the author of the book actually experienced the vicious home invasion that takes place in the movie... and yet he went on to write a novel from the point of view of the rapist of his wife... making him the HERO. The movie was banned in England for many years. It was claimed by some that the movie promotes and glorifies violence. What crap!

","Today's news reports deliver us images of senseless violence each day. School shootings, child abductions, wars in various parts of the world, evil inflicted on innocent fellow human beings. We have long grown accustomed to this aspect of life, no longer shocked or even surprised at what goes on even in our own neighborhoods. ""A Clockwork Orange"", although extreme in its depiction of terror, is actually not that far from the mark of realism. Made in 1971, this was considered a very brutal film for its time. In 2002, I still wonder why this movie is only rated ""R"". It contains a lot of scenes of rape, nudity, graphic violence, and other mayhem that I believe caused it to be banned in several countries. But it has also won praise from many critics and is considered to be a cult classic.<br/><br/>Set in near-future England, this film tells the story of Alex. On the surface, Alex (played by twenty-something Malcolm McDowell) is a typical teenage boy who engages in meaningless conversations with his parents, puts on a good show in front his counselor... and does other things to keep up appearances. However, Alex is a gang member who indulges in every sort of impulsive criminal activity possible while listening to Beethoven to psyche himself up.<br/><br/>One night, Alex and his gang break into a lady's house. The rest of the gang is outside while Alex struggles with the lady until he eventually kills her. After Alex leaves the house, his gang turns on him and leaves him to fend for himself until the police arrive.<br/><br/>Alex is sent to prison. After a while, Alex wants to reform. He has a chance when a new behavioral experiment called the ""Ludovico"" treatment is in need of guinea pigs. Alex volunteers. The experiment is a brainwashing method that causes Alex to be sickened by any form of sex or violence. It even causes him to be sickened by Beethoven's music. <br/><br/>After Alex is released from prison, several things happen. His family disowns him, his former friends are now police officers that assault him, and the experiment has other side effects than just eliminating his urges. He is no longer able to defend himself when attacked as well.<br/><br/>This is not an easy movie to watch with the numerous physically and emotionally violent scenes, but it does make you ask yourself a few things. Is society justified in destroying a predator by creating a victim? Or who needs reform the most: the criminals or the society that continues to punish them after their legitimate sentences have been served? The film is not one that offers any quick or easy answers, yet it shows a perspective of societal problems that is equally timely for 1971 or 2002.<br/><br/>Clearly not for ""mixed audiences"", this film demands an open mind as well as a worldy view. To look inside of the warped mind of a recreational violent bully and search for the ""human"" hidden somewhere requires much forgiveness and a sense of wanting to help rather than seek revenge. An important film, indeed. Sadly, extremely violent and disturbing scenes make this film unsuitable for teens up to age 15 or 16. At a mature age, this film shold be viewed by everyone as a ""Scared Straight"" lesson about the role of violence in modern society."

The greater evil isn't Alex, its the government that ""cured"" Alex from his disease by making him a ""clockwork orange"", a human whose choice and ""goodness"" stems from being rigged like a clock to not be able to endure his own psychopathic mind, not by having a conscience, but by making him violently sick when he desires to act violently or immorally.

","Famous for the controversy surrounding copycat violence and Kubrick's decision to withdraw it in 1973, A Clockwork Orange can now be judged for what it is: an intelligent, visually stunning, disturbing and yet queasily entertaining adaptation of what was already a great work of literature<br/><br/>Adapted from Anthony Burgess's slim best-selling novel written in the invented street slang Nadsat, A Clockwork Orange tells the story of Alex (McDowell) and his thug friends, addicted to mindless acts of violence, killing tramps and raping women. Equally violent is the state's aversion therapy Alex is forced to endure to cure him of his addiction.<br/><br/>Director Kubrick's decision to withdraw the film could be seen, cynically, as the ultimate marketing tool (after all, what film has been so notorious for so long?) but, more realistically, as a significant gesture in the annals of cinema history. The debate about whether he was the victim or instigator of the worst kind of knee jerk censorship, or even merely an artist exercising his right to choose who sees his work will run and run - not least because of Kubrick's stony silence on the issue. The balletic violence is choreographed with an unsettling slickness, coming as a sharp jab to the kidneys. It is difficult to watch and impossible to tear your eyes from. And the film has far more to offer than violent sensationalism.<br/><br/>Set in a future Britain, decrepit and reactionary, it cuts close to the bone when it comes to Englishness. Alex is the aesthetic hooligan, a sci-fi Mod, a Regency dandy who stalks the Thamesmead housing estate before going home to the grotesque working class kitsch of his parents. Also the script's use of Burgess's Nadsat is dazzling - and funny: ""Well, well, well! Well if it isn't fat stinking billy goat Billy Boy in poison! How art thou, thou globby bottle of cheap stinking chip oil? Come and get one in the yarbles, if ya have any yarble, ya eunuch jelly thou!""<br/><br/>The film is stacked with superb performances from younger, hairier versions of talents that went on to become stalwarts of the British acting aristocracy. There's a sideburned Steven Berkoff, as a deranged and screaming police officer, a baby-faced Warren Clark, chilling yet cherubic as the sadistic Dim, and of course the unforgettable tour de force from Malcolm McDowell as Beethoven's most horrorshow admirer, Alex. Directed with assurance and filled with the cynicism, paranoia, visual flair (and lurid titillation) that characterized so much of his work, this is vintage Kubrick and classic cinema."

It is the story of a pretty disturbed young man named Alex DeLarge, who enjoys ultraviolence, sex, gang rape...and Ludwig Van Beethoven. He spends most of his time hanging out with his cronies, who are all disturbed themselves. Each night they decide to have some fun, so they will either resort to a violent beating, rape (As Alex puts it, ""The Ole' In-Out, In-Out""), or both. They hang out at a bar, where spiked milk comes out of the nipples of naked female statues. One night, while Alex and his friends are wreaking havoc, Alex murders an old woman, and is sent to prison. Doctors decide to test a new formula on him, one which will cure him of his horrid habits. They inject him with a syrum, tie him to a chair with a straightjacket, prop his eyelids open with a clamping device, and expose him to horribly violent and sexual films. All of a sudden, he starts to feel a little queasy. His eyes are forced open, so he can't close them. The screen is too big for him to look away, so he has no choice but to watch these graphic films and get sick. Now that violence and sex nauseate Alex, he is released from prison...but when he attempts to kill himself, the government is blamed for what they did to him, and in the end, he is completely cured; violence and sex are again part of his life. This is definitely one of the strangest movies I've ever seen, but there is something about it that draws you into it and makes you want to watch it.

The movie is about Alex de Large (played fantastically by Malcolm McDowell in probably his greatest role ever) who enjoys a bit of the old ultraviolence and in-out in-out(which is Nadsat[slang] for sex) with his droogs(friends) Pete, Georgie, and Dim. Eventually Alex gets caught by the police and is brainwashed by the government, so that he feels sick when he wants to commit an act of violence, sex, or even hearing Beethoven(which is his favorite thing to listen to). If you are familiar with Stanley Kubrick, then you are familiar with good cinema and I highly recommend this to any Kubrick fan or any movie lover in general. This movie was originally rated X mainly because of the nudity, although the nudity in this film isn't really pornographic, there are no sex scenes with the exception of the orgy that Alex has with 2 girls, he met at a music store, which is so fast, with the appropriate music in the background, that it seems far from being considered a porno. 10/10"

Watching Clockwork Orange, you one moment have fun with its wicked sense of humour, incredible invented dialect (taken from Anthony Burgess' hilarious, inventive novel), and the next moment feel sick to the stomach. The first time i saw it i was absolutely terrified. I felt terribly sick in the stomach. Now, of course, it feels slightly less like Satan damning me to hell (and i'm not religious!) and more like a delightfully cinematic, delightfully dark joke. Each time i see it, I further appreciate it: it's visually stunning, menacingly comic and unashamedly controversial and shocking (with a touch of the old social satire, my droogs). It gets in your face and there's no stopping it. Does it all mean something? Is this our future described? That's for you to decide.

","Cult director Stanley Kubrick scores his greatest success with this still controversial 1971 Warner Brothers release. It's a lengthy and extremely violent character study about a young man named Alex (Malcolm McDowell). He leads a punk biker gang in Britain and amuses himself and his gang members by going on nightly orgies of rape and murder. His mind gives him the impression that he can not function whatsoever if he does not torture and kill people on a regular basis. Alex is finally busted when he is found guilty of bludgeoning a young girl to death with a large phallus art sculpture. Sent to prison, he is soon picked up as a potential guinea pig for a rehabilitation experiment that just might take those evil thoughts out of his mind. However, the results of the experiment go awry and Alex begins to show some rather unpredictable behavior changes.

Also the ending didn't say that much as the text does (to be a little piece of a clockwork and have its fixed place, take place in the normal way/circle of life and so on).<br/><br/>But perhaps it was the right thing, when Stanley made the movie less brutal than the book... otherwise he would have produced a ultra-hard splatter/horror picture or as Alex always said: ""a real horrorshow"" ;-)"
"RHPSvegas","10","0","1","21 August 2002"," One MUST have the ability to think before embarking on A Clockwork Orange...
","It's funny. Upon reading the reviews of A Clockwork Orange, all of the<br/><br/>people who wrote negative responses admitted they didn't understand it.<br/><br/>JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND SOMETHING DOESN'T MEAN IT IS<br/><br/>ILLEGITIMITE OR INSULTING YOUR INTELLIGENCE!!! If A Clockwork Orange<br/><br/>insults your intelligence, you are obviously not intelligent enough to<br/><br/>understand it. If you say it does not count because it does not follow<br/><br/>the book 100%, then you are being hypocritical - can you honestly name a<br/><br/>movie based on a book that has followed the book to a ""t""? Didn't think<br/><br/>so. Stanley Kubrick's version of Anthony Burgess's tale is one that is a<br/><br/>lot more in-your face and blatant. It has to be - it's a movie!<br/><br/>Basically, what is implied in the book is actually shown in the movie.<br/><br/>Some aspects have been altered because they'd just be inappropriate to<br/><br/>show in a movie (I doubt ANYONE would honestly want to see a 15-year-old<br/><br/>Alex having sex with two 12-year-old girls). Also, this movie is not<br/><br/>about making fun of or ""ousting"" other films, as one reviewed<br/><br/>misinterpretted. You have to keep in mind while watching this movie that<br/><br/>the language, characters and settings are derived FROM A BOOK. How could<br/><br/>a book try to oust movies - they're not on the same plane (media-wise),<br/><br/>so this type of logic is therefor disengaged. This movie does an<br/><br/>excellent job representing governmental flaws, just as the book did. The<br/><br/>movie, however, is able to capture violence in a unique way - a<br/><br/>picturesque, arthouse way. The violence and sex depicted in the film are<br/><br/>done so uniquely - set to Wendy (used to be Walter) Carlos' haunting<br/><br/>symphonic versions of classical music standards - that really make you<br/><br/>see that even a disgusting act can be portrayed beautifully, which in<br/><br/>itself is a vastly disturbing thought. This movie is very real and<br/><br/>hardcore in its style, which is something one can only WISH Kubrick<br/><br/>would have done with his other films. Everything: the language, the<br/><br/>music, the violence, the sex, the character development, the true<br/><br/>cruelty of the world around us - is all right there, in your face. You<br/><br/>can either choose to turn it off and dismiss it, or endure the whole<br/><br/>thing and attempt to make sense of it (which, if you are capable of<br/><br/>thought or free-will, should not be too hard). A Clockwork Orange IS a<br/><br/>classic, period. 10/10................."
"herb-20","10","0","1","12 June 1999"," Kubrick's best and also a terrific film
","A Clockwork Orange is definitely Kubrick's strangest (and most brilliant) film I have ever seen.  It also makes some good points.  This film's genre is supposed to be Sci-Fi but I think it's more than that.  I think this film is also a drama about what can happen when you put your faith in the government.  That they prove they can mess with you anytime they want, and that includes boys into the bad things in life as well.  A definite classic for Kubrick fanatics and film buffs as well."

","Wow.  That is just how I felt while I was watching this masterpiece.  I have never seen anything like it.  This is the ONLY movie I have ever given a 10. Why?  Simple, it is interesting, insanely original, and most of all FUN! It is just great to watch this movie and drink milk.  It makes me feel like I'm a part of it.  One of Alex's droogs.  Some may say that it is just some kind of independent film that throws sex and violence at the teenage crowd to make a buck, but that is quite untrue!  Well, admitted that it IS violent and it DOES have rape, but these are key plot elemets.  Nothing hurts me more than watching this with someone and when it's over saying ""So?""  and getting the reply ""It was pointless.  Just violence and sex"" I guess some people just don't get it.  The thing that REALLY sets this apart from other movies is the music.  It is a joy to see Alex and his droogs(friends)smash, destroy, yada yada all to the tune of classical music.  It sounds weird, but it really works!  Well anyway, rent this movie.  It will give you a whole new outlook on life. (It will also make you think twice about letting strangers in the house!)"
"Chet!","8","0","1","30 April 1999"," Do not listen to the detractors
","I have just read two previous comments on this film and I was astounded by their stupidity. One complains that Kubrick's film isn't violent enough. The thing is, while films like Fist of the North Star justify violence as a means of gaining revenge, A Clockwork Orange actually faces the real ugliness of violence, embodied in the young and amoral anti-hero, Alex. To just watch a film to get a cheap thrill off brutal scenes is one dimensional. The film also deals with such problems as mind control, teenage peer groups and the aspects which make us human. Evidently, some people don't want this kind of intellectual experience. If this is the case with you, then why don't you just lock yourself away with your copies of Zombie Flesh Eaters and other similar films, and don't trouble anyone else ever again."

","This is an awesome movie. The whole movie gives a displaced feeling from odd camera angels and crazy set designs to the native Nadsat language and introspective violence.

They don't go through or out a window, they actually get hit with the window. The extreme Gene Kelley homage is classic as the original. The cat lady death sequence is cool.

'Clockwork Orange' also has a degree of on the cuff political cynicism not seem in later Kubrick movies and it's all the better for it.<br/><br/>The stong visual nature of the movie is pure Kubrick though it's a certainty that no serious producer or director of the 2000s would dare emulate the style - thanks be for DVDs.<br/><br/>8/10 classic material."

Its too bad Macolm MacDowell wasn't used more often back then, his performance was superb.  Kubrick's display of violence shocks the viewer as well as giving one a new appreciation for Ludwig Van (Beethoven)."
"Rich B","6","0","1","2 August 2000"," Satirical comment on a society years before it arrived.
","More relevant in today's society than it was when it was made, visually exciting and extremely thought provoking. Not as shocking as all the hype would suggest, and the violence all falls by the wayside when the morality and thoughts on reform pull together. The beauty and taste of an orange is all but gone when it's man made. The characters are incidental to the story, and at times I found them intensely annoying, maybe that was intended. An amazing take on today's society, made well before things got this bad."
"mr.blonde","6","0","1","25 June 2000"," Kubrick doesn't measure up to Burgess
","Kubrick does fair justice do Burgess' novel.  Although the message is clear, that life is sustained by the grinding opposition of moral entities, more could have been done by sticking closer to the novel. The important thing is moral choice, and the freedom of choice.  Evil has to exist along with good, in order that moral choice may operate.  Kubrick depicts this vividly, but leaves out much more imagery and juicy details that exist in the Burgess' novel, not to mention hacking off the ending.  By doing this, Kubrick lessens the severity and completeness of the work. By hacking off the ending, he takes a big part out of the process known as  the clockwork orange"
"willeniams","Null","0","1","18 June 2000"," Viddy Well Borothers!
","Without a doubt the most thought provoking film of all time and Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece. Malcom McDowell excels as Alex, giving charm, wit and charisma to the film. The film gets boring during the middle area (Alex's prison sentence) But when he is out and performing acts of Ultra Violence the film is unusually compelling. I would recommend this to anybody who likes films. But be warned, the violence may offend some."

"neerajr","Null","0","1","21 May 2000"," Old question in new light
","Kubrick focuses on an old question about the role of society in meting out justice. There is a story associated with Buddha, the founder of Buddhism. Angulimaal is a robber and a murderer. He robs travelers and kills them. He then keeps their finger as a token count. Buddha reforms him. He converts into a monk. He vows never to take up violence again. On one of his visits to a village, he is recognized and stoned to death by angry villagers. For sentimental value, the story ends with him dying in Buddha's lap telling him that he didn't violate his vow. The anti-hero of Clockwork Orange is a violent youth who is captured and reformed and rendered incapable of violence. He is recognized and almost dies at the hands of those he had brutalized. The ancient question remains : if the criminal is reformed, would his victims accept him? Or would there be a role reversal with him becoming a victim and the endless cycle repeats. The political angle is funny. Kubrick displays sex, violence and rape in this brilliantly directed movie which would keep cheap audience away from his future works."

","And so finally I get to see this film on the big screen. Visually it is superb, and the first half contains some of the great cinematic images and/or scenes. Although McDowall is excellent, you cannot say that for the rest of the cast. The film also drags in the 2nd half, and doesn't offer the most earth shattering argument about the state and violence. In many ways it recreates the Burgess novel faithfully. However the book portrays Alex as much more intelligent, and the government therapy is more prolonged and sinister. This is not Kubrick's finest, but it is one of the key films of the 1970s."

","[WARNING:  This May Contain Spoilers.]<br/><br/>This film looks to the future in all of its '70's splendor.  Of course the future in the eyes of the artists of the '70's was sufficiently bleaker than actual events would allow.  This is kind of a common ground from forward looking films of the time.  It doesn't take away from the moral of the story.<br/><br/>The narrator is indeed a very bad boy.  It is hard to have any positive feelings for him.  However, Kubrick does an interesting  thing halfway through the film.  By illustrating the regimen of the supposed benevolence of society, Kubrick rehabilitates the main character just enough to challenge society itself.<br/><br/>The evil of the individual is replaced by the blind evil of misguided social experimentation on the perpetrator.  The viewer  is left disgusted with both entities.  This is a clever film and a controversial one at the same time. I find it slightly overrated and give it an 8 out of 10 for its brashness."
"macpherr","6","0","2","9 October 1999"," This is a very interesting movie.
","Malcolm McDowell (Mr. Magoo) ""Alex DeLarge"" the young man,  supposed to be fifteen years old,  according to the book, speaking Nadsat as slang (Russified  English) is the key character in the movie.  He is the leader of a gang of four juvenile delinquents.  It appears that they are extremely bored. They committed heinous crimes.  He went to prison and decided to go though ""aversion therapy,"" in order to get released earlier,  and after the therapy he  becomes excessively passive.  After being used by an anti-government group which caused him to try to commit suicide, and much criticism in the press he is restored back to what he was. Watching both processes is very interesting. The first time I watched this movie, is somewhat historical in our household.  My husband and I were vacationing abroad and we found ourselves with nothing to do on Saturday night than to go to a movie. My husband had already watched A Clockwork Orange.   Well, the censors in the country that will remain   nameless decided to add little black balls to covering the genitals and breasts of the naked women in the movie. Those little black balls kept jumping up and down during the ""Billy Boy"" scene. The entire theater was laughing and we all got severely distracted.  We have a good laugh every time we remember those scenes and the jumping black balls!<br/><br/>My favorite scenes: Alex and his sexy eye lashes in one eye only. Alex singing ""Singing in the Rain."" As I understand McDowell improvised that scene, Mr. Kubrick liked it so much that he had to go all over to get the license for the ""Singing in the Rain"" to be part of the movie.  The Minister of the Interior hand feeding Alex after he has been cured (back to normal) with Alex milking the act for all the fun he can get out of it. My favorite quotes: Alex: "" Oh bliss! Bliss and heaven! Oh, it was gorgeousness and gorgeousity made flesh."" Minister: ""Goodness comes from within, goodness is choosing. When a man can not chose he ceases to be a man."" I love the music because it has two of my favorite composers: Ludwig van Beethoven and Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov.  This is a very interesting movie."
