","Snapshot: Brilliant acting by Jeff Bridges and some solid performances by others hold up a movie that has an incoherent, low intensity albeit realistic story. The score of the movie (which is mostly country music) is also pretty good.<br/><br/>Highlights from the plot: ""Crazy Heart"" is not your average motivational movie with strong dialogue and high intensity drama. It follows a sober and a rather unusual romantic story. The story is loosely knit by a few incidents that follow the life of a very talented country musician who is also a raging alcoholic and a chain smoker. On one hand the lack of grandiose drama makes the story more plausible and real but at the same time some may feel that its devoid of depth or intensity. <br/><br/>What's Good: Witty humor (its pretty funny), The acting is top notch especially Jeff Bridges, The score is good (especially if you like country music), The treatment given to the story is fresh in some ways<br/><br/>What's Bad: The story does not SEEM to go in any particular direction. The pace is also a tad slow. The chemistry between Jeff & Maggie is kinda offbeat<br/><br/>Who should watch it: People who really appreciate character development and who expect multi- dimensional characters etc. (Jeff Bridges character might be a treat for such folks), folks who expect a good score <br/><br/>Who should avoid it: Anyone who seeks out some high tension drama, powerful dialogue and a fast paced story should stay away from this one."

","Saw an early screening of ""Crazy Heart"". ""Crazy Heart"" is a very good film for one reason. Many critics have praised it and will continue to do so. Many critics will write it off as ""just another washed-up musician struggling to overcome their addictions and weaknesses and make sense of things"", etc. In a way, they are right. In a way, this is another one of those movies. But, because of Jeff Bridges' absolutely amazing performance, this film is more than that. If you want to see an actor breathe real-life into their character, endow truthful subtlety in their part, and absolutely nail a role that they were born to play, then you need to see Jeff Bridges rendition of Bad Blake. I believed that Bridge's portrayal of ""The Dude"" in ""The Big Lebowski"" was the essential role of his career, but after seeing this performance, I've changed my tune. It's true that we will not be witnessing cinematic history with the incredible plot or awe-inspiring film-making. However, if you are a fan of acting and want to see one of those performances that comes along every once in a rare while, please check out this film."
"KnightsofNi11","7","24","26","24 October 2010"," Jeff Bridges is absolutely amazing
","Here is the film that the ridiculously talented Jeff Bridges finally won an Oscar for, and deservedly so. His performance is the gleaming highlight of this film in the best way possible. He is playing washed up country singer Bad Blake, trying to overcome alcoholism and a dying career. The story is very touching, and how could you expect anything less than incredible from a character study piloted by Jeff Bridges. The film has a very organized focus on Bridges' character but he is also backed by a fantastic supporting cast. Maggie Gyllenhaal plays an aspiring reporter who interviews Blake, only to fall in love with him shortly after. Her performance is equally touching and feels so real alongside Bridges. Colin Farrell plays Tommy Sweet, an old friendship of Bad Blake's that went sour somewhere along the line. And then of course there is the small yet significant role of Bad Blake's long time old fishing buddy Wayne, played by the masterful Robert Duvall. The limited number of scenes between Bridges and Duvall are some of the best and most sincere of the movie. Crazy Heart is a great film to watch in order to see fantastic actors do what they do best... act.<br/><br/>The character development in Crazy Heart embodies the film's strong suit, which is the wonderful acting ability of the cast. There is not a moment when you don't believe in these characters and you truly feel that they are sincere and real. It is also just so incredibly satisfying to watch legends like Bridges and Duvall act side by side in beautiful and perfectly fitting roles such as these. The story of Bad Blake itself is very interesting, but the characters are where the heart and soul of the film lay. The plot leaves something to be desired, but it doesn't fault the movie as much as it could when you have such great actors filling the roles of such articulated characters. Admittedly, the film drags a bit towards the middle and the climax of the film doesn't hit as hard as I would have liked, but it leads into a cathartic and slightly cheesy ending, which leaves you wanting more, but emotionally satisfying nonetheless.<br/><br/>Now, I am not a fan of country music at all, but in the context of this film I absolutely loved it. It is so beautiful and touching that it would almost be a crime to say you didn't like the music while watching its fitting place in this film. And as if I haven't praised the actors in this film enough, I have to give even more kudos to Bridges and Farrell who took voice lessons to sing their own songs in the film, and holy crap do they sound amazing. You would think Jeff Bridges had been a country singer all his life. If you're not a fan of country music I wouldn't recommend listening to the music before you see the movie. But after you see just how perfect the soundtrack fits the film you will love the music. The music makes this film all the more sincere and is one of the only contexts I will ever enjoy country music.<br/><br/>Crazy Heart isn't perfect, but I'm willing to go as far to say that Jeff Bridges is. I can get past the imperfections of the storyline and the slight melodramatic feel the last third of the film emanates when the film boasts a cast as good as this. This is a solid film that is a pure delight to watch. And best of all, it nabbed Jeff Bridges a long overdue Oscar win."
"Chris Knipp","9","80","102","6 January 2010"," Stumbling toward salvation, one day at a time
","'Crazy Heart' is a simple but emotionally resonant movie about a 57-year-old alcoholic country singer whose career is on the skids. There's not much to the story, but not much is necessary with Jeff Bridges as the singer, Bad Blake; Colin Farrell as Tommy Sweet, his handsome acolyte, now a big country music star; Maggie Gyllenhaal as Jean Craddock, a small-time New Mexico journalist with a four-year-old boy who has lousy luck with men, and falls for Bad; and Robert Duvall as Wayne, the singer's clean-and-sober bartender-protector.<br/><br/>Bridges, Gyllenhaal and Farrell have never been better, and Duvall is always pure gold. This movie is Bridges' chance to give a master class in acting, and he does not disappoint for a minute, but he's not alone in the spotlight, and the depth of support he gets is what makes Crazy Heart worth watching.<br/><br/>A lifelong musician and many-talented artist (painting, photography, ceramics) whose thespian preeminence in Hollywood has yet to win him an Oscar, Jeff Bridges inhabits the songs he sings on screen as convincingly and seamlessly as he fits into the shambles of a life and mess of a body that is the film's protagonist. This musical integrity is important because Bad Blake is one of those disintegrating performers whose art has not faltered, though his life has. The songs he sings are his own, and when he's on stage, he's alive. The rest of the time he's lying, deceiving, or numbing out. A great line is when he's asked by Jean where his songs come from and he replies simply, ""Life, unfortunately."" <br/><br/>A parallel to Bridges' work in 'Crazy Heart' is the similarly lived-in and authentic performance as a waning dance hall singer by Gérard Depardieu in Xavier Giannoli's 'The Singer'/'Quand j'étais chanteur,' a richly atmospheric little film released but barely seen in the US. But the milieu here is very different, and as American as 'The Singer's' is French. First time director Scott Cooper has said this movie tells ""Merle Haggard's' story and Kris Kristofferson's and Waylon Jennings'. As Bad Blake, Jeff moves like Waylon, he has Merle Haggard's songwriting ability and Kris Kristofferson's charisma."" Of course Bridges looks a lot like Kristofferson, and Bad Blake puts his hard times into his felt, authentic compositions as Waylon and Merle did. The songs are composed by T Bone Burnett, and are fine; more authenticity is added through other songs such as Townes Van Zandt's ""If I Needed You"" and Waylon Jennings' ""Are You Sure Hank Done It This Way."" Burnett composed the songs with the late Stephen Bruton; and the closing ballad, ""The Losing Kind,"" with Ryan Bingham. Farrell as well as Bridges does his own singing, and his Irishness merges fairly convincingly into a slick country style. Just as Bad Blake is the mentor of Tommy Sweet, in real life Robert Duvall has become a mentor of the actor-writer-director, so his presence anchors the film and presides over it. Bridges knew of the movie but held off from committing to it till he learned his friend Burnett was in, so this is project that must have felt right, ultimately, for all concerned.<br/><br/>Bridges' Bad Blake is so authentically blousy and pathetic he's hard to look at sometimes. He's always drunk and at an opening gig at a Pueblo, Coloradi bowling rink, throws up in a back alley between songs, while the young pickup band he's saddled with has to fill in. In Santa Fe Jean shows up to do an interview, and a May-December romance develops as Bad woos Jean against her better judgment and plies her little boy with homemade pancakes (the boy is hungry for a man in his life and Bad oozes charm, when he's conscious). Gyllenhaal, who played a character struggling with addiction and recovery herself in 'SherryBaby,' gives a performance as a women warring inside with loneliness and need. Her scenes with Bridges are central to the movie, and the chemistry is strong between them.<br/><br/>Blake hasn't written songs for some years, but when he meets up with Tommy prior to a date opening for him to an audience of 12,00 in Denver, Tommy begs him to write some for him. In this way the screenplay manages to steer a course, perhaps a bit too easily, between success and failure. Clearly Bad Blake is still working, even if it's at lousy venues, and to prove it he's always on the phone to a hard-nosed Manager (James Keane) who's finding him the best gigs he can. This eventually leads to a contract to compose songs for an album with Tommy.<br/><br/>'Crazy Heart,' which was written by Cooper from the eponymous novel by Thomas Cobb, is perhaps a bit schematic about the up-down-up trajectory of the talented loser, but it manages to be pretty realistic about the degeneration that is terminal alcoholism. Here, however, it's not a slide into hell like Mike Figgis' Leaving Las Vegas. Though only by the skin of his teeth, and with multiple ailments a car crash reveals, Bad is surviving. So when the moment comes and he hits his bottom, he still has the strength to straighten out. Maybe the fast-forward finale is a bit too upbeat, but the memory the movie leaves is, of course, of Bridges with a bottle, a guitar, and a sad sweet song, and of some of the year's best movie acting."
"littlemartinarocena","8","75","96","7 February 2010"," A Golden New Decade for Jeff Bridges
","The pleasure to see Jeff Bridges playing a man ready to start a whole new life, a day a the time, is indescribable. And as if that wasn't enough, love is the inspiring factor the motivating force. I've been a fan of Jeff Bridges since I first saw him in ""The Last Picture Show"", then ""Thunderbolt and Lightfoot"", ""Fat City"" right up to ""The Big Lebowski"" He's never less than totally there. Truthful and powerful even when he plays characters that are the opposite of truthful, the opposite of powerful that even don't seem to be there. ""Crazy Heart"" reminds us. He's one of the greatest American actors of his or any other generation. His face when he realizes he lost the little boy will haunt me forever. At the Golden Globes, in his devastating charismatic, humble way he thanked his parents. I thank them too Jeff, you are a wonder."
"ClaytonDavis","7","106","144","4 December 2009"," It's ""The Weary Kind"" for Bridges that Soars...
","In his directorial debut, Scott Cooper adapts Thomas Cobb's Crazy Heart, the story of Bad Blake, a washed-up country star with an alcohol addiction. The film stars Jeff Bridges, in the lead role, and Maggie Gyllenhaal as Jean, a young reporter is taken in by Blake's heartache and pain.<br/><br/>Cooper's direction is of subtle greatness. The film is quiet, slow-paced, but works. It's never meant to be loud or over-the-top, which some may be expecting; it's a beautiful written song about life thrust into a two-hour sympathy riot. Bridges, who will surely receive Oscar attention, is reserved, charismatic, and raw. Bridges' 58-year-old Blake is one of the better performances of the year. There are obvious comparisons to Robert Duvall's performance Tender Mercies, with critics believing a possibly similarity to Mickey Rourke's work in The Wrestler, which is certainly not the case, this is unique in its own way. Bridges doesn't overcook the role which would have been easy, he's effortless and sings quite well.<br/><br/>Maggie Gyllenhaal, Oscar snubbed for her works in Sherrybaby and World Trade Center, is nearly average in her work. She's coy with Jean and underplays her, but unlike Bad Blake, her role doesn't call for it. Jean is a bruised, kindhearted, and devoted mother to her four-year old son Buddy (Jack Nation, as cute as can be), but uneven in narrative forming.<br/><br/>Robert Duvall is brief, and nearly ineffectual. As the bar owner Wayne, he offers a humanity for Blake outside of woman, which is needed in the film, but in the end is unmemorable. Also sharing this boat is the talented Colin Farrell, who's both likable and adequate, but upstaged by scenes with Bridges.<br/><br/>The only thing more beautiful than Bridges' performance is the song ""The Weary Kind,"" which is submission for Best Original Song for the Academy Awards. This is one of the best songs written for a film in the last ten years. Delightful lyrics and exquisitely executed, the song one of the rare occasions of the perfect song for a perfect film, given the film's nature.<br/><br/>While Crazy Heart doesn't offer anything insightful to the realm of cinema, it's simple, uncomplicated, and honest, which you can't appreciate. For a first time out, Cooper does an admirable job.<br/><br/>***/****"
"thesubstream","7","56","76","16 January 2010"," You know you're in a state when you hand-pour your pee on a bowling alley.
","There's a shot in a scene near the beginning of Scott Cooper's Crazy Heart that's so jarring that it has to have been a choice, but I can't for the life of me unpack what it means. Jeff Bridges plays forgotten country legend Bad Blake, drunk and down on his luck, a one-time great forced to play tiny New Mexico bars for tiny over-the-hill crowds. As he cruises into town in his rusty Suburban and empties out his pee bottle, he realizes that his manager has booked him to play in a bowling alley, where he begins to drink prior to the show. There's a shot of him at the bar that is an exact visual echo of Bridge's most famous character of recent years, the similarly booze-addled Dude from The Big Lebowski, famously bellying up to a bowling alley bar, talking to a cowboy. It's odd and unmistakable, as Bridges' the Dude in the Cohen Bros. first-cult-then-full-blown classic dopey caper movie has become iconic, his sozzled, affronted complaints as firmly lodged in the minds of movie folk as Travis Bickle's spookyisms or the monologue by the guy in Network who got mad and told everybody to go yell out the window.<br/><br/>Where the Dude's drunk and drugged wanderings seemed blessed, though, by a cinematic ray of Private Eye light that kept him safe through to the end of his caper, Bridges' Bad Blake is broken down, on the way out. A member of his backing band that he had mentored, Tommy Sweet (Colin Farrell), has moved on to find incredible success on his own and exists, but is unwilling to do an album of duets that Blake and his lizard-skin booted agent need to pull his career out of the toilet. He meets a young journalist (Maggie Gyllenhaal) who herself has had a rough patch and their bruised romance sees Blake back on some kind of road to life.<br/><br/>Bridges inhabits the role as thoroughly as is seemingly possible - he quite simply is Bad Blake. Much of the music (composed by T-Bone Burnett, who among other things did the music for the Coens' O Brother, Where Art Thou?) Bridges sings himself and he's got a not-half-bad country voice, but it's in the busted-boot gait and whisky-sipping slouch that Bridges carves the character out. The rest of the film is almost as good as he is. Cooper's script has a habit of freely dipping into the well of cliché - the whisky soaked forgotten crooner lost in the shadow of inauthentic ""new country"", salvation and sobriety at the feet of a sad single mother who doesn't want to be hurt again - but then at the last minute, swerving away into if not original then certainly less clichéd territory. Tommy Sweet, when he makes his entrance into the story, is not half the villain the first half of the film would have you believe, and Gyllenhaal's single mom is something a hair's breadth more interesting than a sucker for punishment, loyal to a fault. The film could have been a disaster, and at times it's half-way there, but there are enough smart choices in the script and good performances from interesting actors that the film ends up (for the most part) overcoming its own flaws.<br/><br/>It does country well, and it's as authentic as a film can be to a genre of music (like punk, or metal, or rap) that is itself so utterly cliché ridden that arguments over whether so-and-so is ""real country"" are a common fervent pastime for fans and the artists themselves. Bad Blake seems as much of a real, breathing human being as Merle Haggard or Waylon Jennings, which is obviously somewhat of a back-handed compliment. Crazy Heart's story is an old one: a busted down, down and out nobody screws up, hits bottom, and becomes somebody again. We've seen it before, but it has enough soul and Bridges' Blake has enough human hitch in his step, that it manages to be moving, if not refreshing. 7/10"

","This is a sweet and believable film about real people. The story is anything but original, and yet it is done very nicely, with kind, genuine performances and a majestic Jeff Bridges. One very good move is that the director and screenwriter put most of the exaggeration and cliches at the beginning of the movie in order for us to ""get' the characters. In doing so, the movie got more interesting and realistic as it went on."
"gilligan-11","9","38","52","29 January 2010"," Engaging portrait of a flawed talent
","Jeff Bridges' incredible performance is not the only aspect of this movie that deserves praise. Bridges—who will most likely win an Oscar for his performance (sorry, Colin Firth, it was just your bad luck to deliver your best performance in the same year)—inhabits the character of Bad Blake so thoroughly and convincingly that you forget you're watching Jeff Bridges; he truly gives life to this alcoholic but talented country singer who is searching for some joy and redemption at the end of his career. Maggie Gyllenhaal is wonderful in a supporting role as Blake's girlfriend, and Colin Farrell is a genuine surprise as Blake's protégé, Tommy Sweet. (By the way, who the heck knew that Farrell—and Bridges, for that matter—could sing so well?) Bonus: the soundtrack is awesome. Interesting cinema synergy—Robert Duvall (still a working actor at the age of 79), who produced this film and has a small supporting role, won a Best Actor Oscar in 1984 for playing a character similar to Bad Blake in ""Tender Mercies."""
"Quinoa1984","7","38","52","31 December 2009"," a subtle and moving performance in an otherwise decent little movie
","People have already started the comparison, and not without some reason, of Crazy Heart with last year's film about a down-on-his-luck old timer in his chosen profession, The Wrestler. And sure the comparisons can be made quite a lot, not simply due to the same studio, Fox Searchlight, distributing the films, or that the main characters are practically washed-up in what they do but keep chugging along, or that they have medical problems, or that they're estranged from their kids, or that the woman in their lives is a stop-go-stop affair. The good news is the movies can stand on their own terms, but somehow, at the end of the day, I would probably prefer Aronofsky's gritty naturalism over the first time director Scott Cooper's more slick indie-treatment, with country and wide-open spaces substituting for grisly New Jersey.<br/><br/>And yet you should go see Crazy Heart, and it's not just for Jeff Bridges as Bad Blake, a country musician, 57, who has been on hard times for a while and whose main problem, alcoholism, prevents him from being an unstoppable musical force (think Johnny Cash with a little extra blues) and kind boyfriend to Jean (Gyllenhaal, also quite good). Well, it could almost be all for him - it's marvelous to see him transform into this character, somewhat reminiscent of 'the Dude', but with a more cynical view of life and his former partner (Tommy, surprisingly done by Colin Farrell), and how we really do want him to get better. It's a sympathetic portrait done by a master of American film acting, and even if you don't particularly love Country music it's a worthwhile venture to see him in it.<br/><br/>That's the other thing: the music is actually (and this is coming from a not-big-fan of Country music save for some exceptions like Cash and Williams) quite superb. All of the songs are charged either by a real drive to bring the house down with the joy of playing live, or by the tender moments such as the ""Weary Kind"" title track, which may, along with Bridges, get T-Bone Burnett his first Oscar nod. The music is one of the things that makes Blake's journey wonderful to watch, even if, sadly, the story is lacking in ways that other movies (not just The Wrestler) do much better. Only a third act twist seems to be compelling, as the rest of the story kind of coasts the characters along, the only roadblock Blake's drinking.<br/><br/>As sometimes happens, it's a towering performance in the midst of an otherwise competent, enjoyable but slight debut feature. But it is something, and often interesting."

","""Bad"" Blake (Jeff Bridges) was once a famous country singer-songwriter (although how big and how famous are never clearly spelt out), but he has now slid to the very bottom of the greasy music pole: now a reluctant opening act or playing small shows in bowling alleys or suchlike dingy places.<br/><br/>Age, booze and multiple divorces have taken further toll on his mind and body. Today, he rarely thinks much beyond his next drink or resting his weary bones in the nearest - and preferably cheapest - motel.<br/><br/>In to this paint-peeling world comes a hint of genuine love and affection, courtesy of a much younger single-mother (and professional music journalist) Jean Craddock played by Maggie Gyllenhaal.<br/><br/>There is not a lot of originality about this production. Indeed it might be viewed as an attempt to re-film The Wrestler in Stetson hats, where it not for Bridges. Talk about carrying a show on your shoulders. Although it does beg the question of how simplistic/basic country music is when an actor (with only very occasional musical forays to his name) can be so convincing.<br/><br/>(Clever pastiche songs being a great aid to the believability.) <br/><br/>Despite the negative opening headlines, things are not totally hopeless. Musical friends and agent are loyal. Dues are owed and paid. Indeed there seems to be ladies (of a certain age, granted) who, still, want to entertain the former legend back in their rooms. Yes, even the bottom of the showbiz barrel seems to have its freebies and its perks. When sober enough to actually enjoy them, that is.<br/><br/>In many ways the act or review - and therefore after-the-fact analysis - takes some shine off this drift-down-the-river production. Indeed only re-enforces how little there is to chew on.<br/><br/>Craddock has to be either mad or desperate to to take an interest in this long broken down musical artist who is not only old enough to be her father, but only one false step away from being a vagrant. What does she see in him? Is she so seduced by the romance of low-rent showbiz to see he is totally selfish (he has, for example, long taken no interest in his own child) and lives in the past? <br/><br/>Maybe Bridges should milk this a bit - go on stage as his alter-ego Bad Blake. I am sure people would be happy to see it. Clearly he is good enough and the professional and functional songs on display here would pass twenty minutes of general inspection."

Henry Fielding, Tom Thumb, The Great<br/><br/>When a memorable performance transcends a mediocre plot, the result is a memorable role flanked by a forgettable film. Such is the case of Jeff Bridges as Bad Blake, a sodden wreck of a country singer still making a living playing at bars and bowling alleys in Crazy Heart, an apt title.<br/><br/>Not Garth Brooks or Willie Nelson, but well-known enough to be offered free booze and free ladies, 57 year old Bad is like his 30 year old pickup truck, still serviceable but ready to bust at any moment. Bridges is a believable singer/drunk, not overdoing either but pathetic enough for you to want to strangle some sense into him while he still can perform. And write songs—if he can get to them, especially at the encouragement of Tommy Sweet (a convincing, real life bad boy Colin Farrell), young country singer now flourishing partly because of Bad's good mentoring. The descent into cliché is quick as Santa Fe reporter Jane (Maggie Gyllenhaal) falls for him during an interview for her paper. She has a four-year old child—well, you can guess the rest of the film through romance and rehab but maybe not denouement. <br/><br/>The addition of one of the producers of the film, Robert Duvall, as Bad's friend and club owner Wayne, is a welcome allusion to Duvall's Oscar performance as country singer Mac Sledge in Tender Mercies. Add T Bone Burnett as a song writer and producer of the film and you have a promising pedigree. Unfortunately director/writer Scott Cooper may not have caught the fire of the original novel by Thomas Cobb.<br/><br/>I will nominate Bridges as one of the best actors of the year. That's the best I can offer you besides the New Mexico landscape and cloud dotted blue sky.

","Crazy Heart is written and directed by Scott Cooper and based on the 1987 novel of the same name by Thomas Cobb. It stars Jeff Bridges, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Colin Farrell & Robert Duvall. Bridges plays Bad Blake, a veteran country singer/songwriter who is down on his luck but always full of the booze. Embarking on another weary tour of dead-end towns, his life perks up when he meets young newspaper reporter Jean Craddock (Gyllenhaal) and her son Buddy (Jack Nation).<br/><br/>Apparently Bad Blake is based on three real men, Waylon Jennings, Kris Kristofferson and Merle Haggard. With Scott Cooper saying he had hoped to make a biopic about Haggard but the rights were too difficult to obtain. Of further interest is that the Cobb novel is actually inspired by country singer Hank Thompson.<br/><br/>Crazy Heart is the type of movie that crops up from time to time that finds a wide and appreciative audience. That of the human interest story that beats a true and uplifting heart. That Crazy Heart has found the afore mentioned audience is mainly down to Bridges and his very affecting turn as the pathetic drunk resorting to what equates as singing for his beer money. For in truth the story is generic and straight forward, and one can guarantee you will have seen this before, and done much better in fact. But this is still fine story telling, a good movie propelled by rich characterisations {Gyllenhaal too is excellent} and paced with almost elegiac precision, that allows the humanistic elements to carry the audience to a fitting, if not surprising, finale. There's also value in the music on offer, with memorable tunes and note worthy renditions given by Bridges and Farrell. Barry Markowitz's photography also blends nicely with the narrative. His shooting of New Mexico lends itself to beauty and offers hope to Blake's future, while the tone down lighting for the dim bars that Bad is singing in brings to the fore the lowness that the singer has now reached. Bridges has done far better work than this, but who would deny him the Oscar for Best Actor that duly came his way at ceremony time? It's a great performance, tho, one that totally engages the viewers. At times infuriating & pathetic, yet at others he be charming and grasping our pity by the truck load. That both he and Gyllenhaal make a believable couple is the best compliment one can give them both. Their efforts in this movie deserve a look.<br/><br/>A simple redemptive story is lifted to greater heights by Gyllenhaal refusing to let her character be a cipher, and Bridges doing heart-breaking like few others can. 7/10"
"howard.schumann","8","7","9","14 May 2010"," A good film that avoids cheap sentimentality and delivers an adult experience
","Like the plays and poems of William Shakespeare that emerge, James Shapiro notwithstanding, from the private pain of the author's life experience, country music comes from the sadness and personal longing of the songwriter. This has never been more clearly displayed than in Crazy Heart, the first feature by director Scott Cooper, the film that won an Oscar for Jeff Bridges. Based on a novel by Thomas Cobb, Bridges is country singer Bad Blake who is barely making it as a performer, beset by booze, a big stomach, and an unattractive beard. He was once a famous performer but now is limited to sing in saloons and bowling alleys but still draws a crowd because of his reputation.<br/><br/>Although the character doesn't seem to care any more, Bridges talent as a performer is so great that the viewer will follow him all the way to the bottom if necessary. Blake is a poet as well as a musician and, like Jaques, the exiled lord and traveller in Shakespeare's As You Like It, can ""suck melancholy out of a song, as a weasel sucks eggs"". Redemption of sorts, however, comes in the form of Jean Craddock (Maggie Gyllenhall) who turns up in his hotel room for an interview. Jean, a single mother, who has to care for a four year-old son takes a personal interest in Blake and their mutual loneliness and disillusionment brings them together and also pulls them apart. While Crazy Heart is a sweet and gentle film that has a lot of humanity, it does not contain the kind of powerful conflict that would set it apart and make it truly memorable. Yet it is a good film that avoids cheap sentimentality and delivers an adult experience for adults, not an everyday occurrence in this age of super heroes."

","I never saw this back when it came out, it seemed like a career Oscar for bridges. Having now seen it, no way this performance would've gotten traction had Bridges not been known. it's not a very dramatic, very showy piece of work, and it's definitely such a surprise it was able to garner such enthusiasm from different people and from the Academy as a whole. Bridges is still great though, just not what you'd expect. Maggie Gyllenhaal is also really effective. Her character doesn't have a whole lot of notes to play but she does everything pretty well and while her Oscar nod came as a real shock, not totally undeserving. It's a nice performance, in a nice but unextraordinary film."
"callanvass","9","8","11","21 July 2010"," A simple, yet wonderful tale about the road to redemption. Jeff Bridges deserved his Oscar.
","Crazy Heart is a fitting title for this movie, because Jeff Bridge's is full of crazy heart. I'll be the 1st one to admit, it's not original in the slightest. Mickey Rourke did it with The Wrestler, and many other people have done it in other genres, but Jeff Bridges makes it all worthwhile. I think I could identify with Bad Blake so much, is because he kept to himself for the most part. He didn't want any trouble, he didn't want anybody really for a while, he just wanted to drink his McClure's and smoke his cigarettes, he really was a decent man. I thought the whole ordeal and story off Bad falling for Jean|Maggie Gyllenhaal| and growing a fondness for her son was so well done, and it showed the loneliness Bad had deep down. You can see resentment in his eyes when he walks off on Tommy Sweet|Colin Farrell| You can see he wants redemption, but doesn't really have the courage to do so. It was just a very well done movie, and I enjoyed the simple, yet powerful story it had.<br/><br/>Performances. Jeff Bridges is phenomenal in his role, and most certainly deserved his Oscar. Not only is his acting perfect, but his singing was also impressive. I felt so many emotions for his character, and ended up falling in love with it. Kudos to Mr. Bridges for giving me such a captivating performance. Maggie Gyllenhaal is excellent as Jean, the protective mother, but also aspiring journalist. Her character isn't as deep as Bridges, but she is very vital to the movie's success. Colin Farrell is very good as Tommy Sweet. He didn't have as much screen time as I'd have liked, but he did well in his part. Robert Duvall adds a touch of class to everything he's in, and here was no different.<br/><br/>Bottom line. Crazy Heart is a movie I thoroughly enjoyed. It played with my emotions, and it made me smile when it was over. It's nice to see a movie that lives up to the hype once in a while. A must see.<br/><br/>9/10"

","The beautiful panoramas of the Great Southwest were worth watching. The desert in bloom was a sight to behold. Those parts of the film were completely enjoyable. The portrayal of the character Otis ""Bad"" Blake was credible, and Jeff Bridges did a very good job. The incessant use of cigarettes became dull, and, by the time this long movie was over, sickening. The casting was doubtful as Gyllenhaal seemed very young next to Bridges, who is 57 years old. Her performance was good. There were too many closeups, which always means a shallow story, and much of the time we listened to music when we wanted to know more about the characters. The gratuitous sex scene was completely unnecessary, and somewhat incredible given the age and condition of the character. The contrived gestures of holding her breast, and slipping his hand into her underpants were so forced that they were uninteresting. The many talents of Robert Duvall were wasted on a trivial role, but the fishing scene was a gem. The scene in the Santa Fe bar where the character Bad Blake dances with a spectator was the best music scene in the film. Overall, a very good performance by Bridges, but the film could have been better."

","So far, only two other IMDb users (Casablanca and M2b) saw the same movie I saw when we went to see Crazy Heart. I was tricked into seeing the movie by falling for the Oscar buzz surrounding Jeff Bridges, who plays Bad Blake. And even though we all knew this was going to be The Wrestler with music, my friends and I went to see what the critics promised: Jeff Bridges transcend an obviously formulaic plot with an amazing performance. Bridges performance was spot on as a disgusting, burnt out, drunkard, who, like Randy 'The Ram' Robinson has to settle for humiliating gigs in no-name towns, just to keep himself in booze and cigarettes. Good performance. Not amazing. But the rest of the movie goes nowhere and none of us could buy the romance between ""Bad"" and Jean, played by Maggie Gyllenhal. Maggie's never looked better, but instead of channeling Marisa Tomei and looking a little down and out or rough around the edges, we are supposed to believe that this perky single mom with an adorable son and neat-as-a-pin house would fall in love with an overweight, sloppy drunk who drinks 'till he pukes, chain smokes and spends his days watching porn. No back story on Jean and why she would be so vulnerable that she'd fall in love with him during an interview.... Mommy was a country music groupie with a crush on ""Bad""? .... Daddy was an alcoholic who ran off on her? .....all we know is that she's made ""bad choices"". Robert Duval plays himself, basically. The character actors are believable, but not engaging. The one subtle but surprising performance was turned in by Colin Farrell who impresses me more each time I see him. I know I ask a lot of my $12 movie ticket. Next time I'll trust my instincts."
"M2b","3","24","42","31 January 2010"," My eagerly awaited review of Crazy Heart
","Huh?<br/><br/>When does the movie start? The film is formulaic, predictable, pleasant. That's the good news, it won't kill you to sit thru it. Wait for Johnny Depp's Mad Hatter to go see when you're in a mood to end your own life.<br/><br/>I don't understand the raves for Jeff Bridges' performance, and I like him, always have. I think that's how he's winning awards for Crazy Heart, people like him. His performance is professional. He does the job. It's not in any way a stand out job of acting, really. He's good, that's it. Maggie Gyllenthal is also OK as his younger lover interest. She looks great from the neck up and Bridges' Bad Blake keeps yapping about how gorgeous she is. But they don't keep the camera away from her skinny body and flat bottom, and frankly, she didn't look that hot to me. They could have cast this part better. The best thing in the film was a big star's unadvertised part as Bad Blake's super successful protégé. It's not a secret if you look it up, like they did with Tom Cruise in Tropic Thunder, but this guy's performance was the best in the film, so I won't ruin the surprise and name the star here.<br/><br/>In the film, they keep raving about how great the song that Bad Blake writes for Maggie is, called (surprise) Crazy Heart. Huh? (again). The song is truly truly ordinary, far less as songs than the ones supposed to be Bad Blake's old hits. In the film, I think they briefly mention some famous-not so famous country song writer/singer who the Bad Blake character is supposed to be based on. I never heard of him before, and likely won't ever again.<br/><br/>The cinematography of the Southwest is excellent, breathtaking at times. The film is not. It is being badly overrated by the jackal pack that reviews films nowadays. They sniff out what the consensus is saying, and write accordingly.<br/><br/>If you wait for DVD-rental, unless you're a country music fan, you won't make it thru the two hours without falling asleep or hitting pause to go surf the channels. Trust me."

","""Crazy Heart"" is one of the better movies of 2009 thanks to the usual winning combination of great writing, acting, and directing. Jeff Bridges is fully deserving of his Oscar Award, believable as ever as a complete alcoholic trying to latch onto something with meaning in his broken down life. With his character, the road-weary country-star Bad Blake, you can tell he's put in loads of practice time at performance including singing and playing guitar, and it comes off heartily genuine. Especially wonderful for me were the first 20 minutes or so of the movie before the main storyline picked up, I thoroughly enjoyed his actions and reactions to the Midwest town-folk - and his almost aversion to getting up on stage while inebriated. I thought supporting cast members all were better than satisfactory as well, this movie is very much worth a look if you like dramas."
"ddelamaide","1","16","27","23 August 2010"," Over-hyped cliché
","Stopped watching halfway through (in the ""happy"" phase when Bad Blake goes ballooning with cute little 4-year-old) because it was simply too sappy and cliché-ridden to watch.<br/><br/>Jeff Bridges obviously can do drunk and yes he can smoke like a chimney, but it must have been a weak field for him to walk away with an Oscar for this performance. The real shortcoming is the script, however, which takes a dull, trite story and magnifies, if possible, its dullness and triteness.<br/><br/>Perhaps the weakest point of the script is the lame, lame single mom played by Maggie Gyllenhall (the irony that she should get an Academy Award nomination for her worst role ever). The script never establishes a basis for her motivation, and the director seems to want to imbue a hopeless script with some life by turning her into coy, then bursting into tears because Bad Blake will never remember her. There is zero sexual tension between Gyllenhall and Bridges (Gyllenhall is too old for the part anyway, but the gap in their ages makes it all faintly ridiculous).<br/><br/>Colin Farrell almost steals the show by giving a nuanced performance of a performer with genuine respect for his mentor but ruthless in his goal of keeping top billing. But even he cannot escape the clichés of the script.<br/><br/>I didn't see this in the theater because I found the trailer off-putting -- it looked like a completely predictable rehash of an incredibly trite story. After the Oscar buzz, took a chance on renting it, but found that the trailer accurately portrayed the complete lack on inspiration in this story."

Harder still anytime you get a chance to see Robert Duvall on screen, but, it's hard as heck not to walk out of Crazy Heart without thinking: this exact movie has been made before, made better, only starring Robert Duvall. As in Tender Mercies...so good that Duvall won a Best Actor Oscar. I loved Jeff Bridges channeling Waylon Jenning's look and music, but that was about it. Alcoholic country singer, grown child of a former marriage, single woman with a young child, interaction with a young backup band...it's Tender Mercies II, with a bit of Payday thrown in.

","The fifty-seven year old washed out and alcoholic country music singer Otis ""Bad"" Blake (Jeff Bridges) is totally broken, singing in bowling alleys, bars and clubs for small audiences. Bad Blake is a self- destructive man and is drunkard, inveterate smoker, overweight and with an untreated cancer and despite the advice of a doctor, he does not change his lifestyle. He feels bitterness towards his former partner, the successful country singer Tommy Sweet (Colin Farrell), who started his career and was trained by Blake.

The story is moralist and conservative and does not present any surprise or emotion. For those that like country-music, Jeff Bridges shows a great resemblance with Kris Kristofferson and sings very well many songs. This film is not original or deeper and gloomy like Billy Wilder's ""Lost Weekend"" or Blake Edwards' ""Days of the Wine and Roses"", but entertains.

","Jeff Bridges is one of my favorite actors, and just so happens to be the leading man in two of my favorite films (The Big Lebowski and Arlington Road). Now 61 years young, he's certainly showing no signs of slowing down.<br/><br/>Crazy Heart, the 2009 offering for which Bridges took home the Oscar for Best Actor, is a prime example of the acting titan's ability to consistently breathe credibility into any variety of characters. Think of it as an optimistic version of Aronofsky's The Wrestler (though it doesn't resonate on quite so many levels).<br/><br/>Here, our protagonist is Bad Blake, an aging country music legend who's been reduced to churning out the same tired songs in bowling alleys, side street restaurants, and the like. Bad makes no bones about the fact that he's tired of his career existing on the verge of oblivion, but he's also conscious of the fact that his problems are a result of his diseased condition. Bad's a chain-smoking alcoholic who has plenty of domestic issues he's trying to sort out, and his nightly post- performance routine involves liaisons with less-than-reputable female admirers.<br/><br/>All of that begins to change when he meets Jean (Gyllenhaal), a Santa Fe journalist who who's trying to start her career as an entertainment writer. The two hit it off almost immediately, and some genuine emotions lead to a relationship that accurately mirrors the non- Hollywood (insert ""harsh"") complexity found in real life affinities.<br/><br/>There are a few predictable ""bumps in the road"" for Bad and Jean, but the story never deteriorates into the usual sequence of mistakes which finds a reconciled couple kissing as the credits roll. On top of this— as previously indicated—Crazy Heart is surprisingly upbeat. Though Bad has his fair share of issues, the movie makes a clear statement that recovery (especially from the dark dredges of alcoholism) is, in fact, possible. It even goes a step further by highlighting what life beyond such a wretched state is like.<br/><br/>That's what I like most about Crazy Heart—the fact that it doesn't take (what is now) a clichéd route with its plot. Sure, people die from the same things Bad is battling on a daily basis, but there are many who overcome their circumstances. This is something that director Scott Cooper and novelist Thomas Cobb obviously wanted to emphasize, and I heartily applaud the decision.<br/><br/>Crazy Heart is worth your time. It doesn't ""reinvent the wheel,"" but stellar acting and an able story make it that rare faux biopic that leaves you smiling instead of grinding your teeth as you mull over the bitter fruit of the world's debauchery."
"The_Film_Cricket","Null","2","2","10 May 2012"," Jeff Bridges' performance is as deep as a sad country song.
","*** SPOILER ALERT *** <br/><br/>Jeff Bridges has been a movie star all my life - I mean literally all my life - he had his breakthrough in The Last Picture Show in 1971, the year I was born. In 38 years, Bridges has become one of our most dependable actor, turning in a gallery of great performances, not one of which he could look back and be ashamed of. Bridges has the kind of presence that Robert Mitchum had, he never seems to be acting. It always feels like the camera just found him. That kind of presence is rare and it has gotten him a great deal of praise but very rarely any true accolades. He has been nominated for the Oscar four times but has never won. Maybe that comes from the fact that his performances are never showy. Most actors who receive awards stand out, but Bridges blends in, always seeming like an organic part of the film rather than a front-and-center component.<br/><br/>His laid-back style is at the center of Scott Cooper's Crazy Heart which is easily the best performance of Jeff Bridges' distinguished career. He occupies a character that should be riddled with clichés, but isn't - a drunken country singer. He plays Bad Blake, a once-great country star who's life is a sad country song. At 57, he is a drunk, a veteran of four failed marriages and the father of a kid he hasn't seen in 20 years. He still gets noticed by his fans, to whom he is gracious. He has lived a hard life that has left regret and a lot of broken hearts in its wake. He chooses to keep his first name anonymous. When a journalist asks for it he tells her ""I'm Bad Blake. My tombstone will have my real name on it. Until then, I'm just . . . Bad"" In a way, the name is penance.<br/><br/>Blake is a drunk with a sagging career but he isn't bitter. His heavily-lined face shows the years of booze and hard living and his voice is a low growl rubbed raw by gallons of whiskey. We rarely see him without a bottle in his hand, he is an alcoholic and it is his addiction that has left him lonely and destitute - he doesn't appear to have a home and lives in a string of unkempt motel rooms. His lifestyle is causing a strain on health. He not only drinks but has chain smoked himself into emphysema. Blake is not a bad guy, but he is a picture of self-destruction. An opening scene, in which he exits his 1978 Suburban with a milk jug filled with urine and empties it onto the ground (he travels a lot), is incredibly symbolic - this man is, literally, pissing his life away.<br/><br/>The songs are a Greek chorus to the life he lives off-stage. He sings songs like ""Somebody Else"" which contains the lyrics ""I saw you shed a single tear. Still I can't peal away the years"". The movie wouldn't work without songs like this, they tell us that his life comes through his music. It also wouldn't work if Bridges couldn't sing. He has a natural voice in which he doesn't just sing the lyrics but actually believes what he is singing. Blake's craggy voice, beaten raw by booze, gives those songs a kind of authentic feel.<br/><br/>Crazy Heart is not a portrait of blind self-destruction; it is the story of a man weighed down by regret who wants to find some form of redemption. That comes - from the heart of a good woman. She is Jean Craddock (Maggie Gyllenhaal), a journalist who interviews Blake for a local magazine. There is an unexpected charm about this poor soul and it captures her heart, especially when he breaks away from the monotony of the standard interview questions and tells her ""I want to talk about how bad you make this room look."" This charm breaks Jean's journalistic integrity and is made curious by the fact that she admits that she is a magnet for men who don't treat her right (from her failed marriage has come a son named Buddy). She young yet, she has been burned by men but still hasn't acquired the thick skin that she needs to resist them.<br/><br/>The rest of the story finds Blake attempting to reform his hard-living while trying to establish broken ties and reestablish his damaged career. Blake's pride is as much to blame for his self-destruction as anything else as when he gets an offer to write songs for Tommy Sweet (Colin Ferrell), a kid that Blake once mentored who is now a rising young country music star. The look on Blake's face when he is asked to be the kid's opening act is one of damaged pride and the realization of how far he has fallen.<br/><br/>Stories like this have been written over and over since the beginning of the movies, but Cooper's screenplay (from a novel by Thomas Cobb) manages to create real characters who are not manipulated by the plot. We expect that Blake's drinking will lead to the standard scenes in which he is stumbling on the stage but, aside from a moment when he must excuse himself to make use of the back alley garbage can, he remains a wonderful presence on the stage. Blake's fate is expected but his journey getting there is not. When he makes a serious mistake involving Jean's son Buddy there are consequences but not what we expect and it leads him into a kind of redemption that - in a lesser film - would have seemed tacked on. When we get to the end, it is hard to believe that Blake is going to be able to sustain a clean life but we sense that he is smarter about the damage that he has caused to other and to himself."

","First off, I hate movie like these. By these I mean the type of movie shot like a bad documentary with disconnected scenes with a really thin story line. I like Jeff Bridges a lot and he is a really brilliant actor but it seems like he was placed in a scene without a script and told to act. I know this is not true but it seems like it was ad libbed for most of them. Therefore if it was scripted Bridges deserves an Oscar. But like that Mickey Rourke wrestling flick and some Ryan Gosling shyte about a school teacher it was just a group of disjointed scenes clubbed together to tell a simple story in an artsy-farty way. Actually this is not so much a review of Crazy Heart but of all these type of movies. You know the type. The actor getting on with his job but the drunk cameraman trying to keep his feet and occasionally failing as the camera fecks off somewhere else with the poor actor still doing his stuff.

"dierregi","1","8","15","7 June 2010"," Soporific – worst Bridges movie ever?
","Much as I like Jeff Bridges, I think this is one of his worst movies ever. The plot revolves around the downfall of a faded country-western singer, who likes drinking and is not good at relationships. He is supposed to start appreciating life again, thanks to the love for a young reporter – a single mother, to add also the love for the child into the package. Unfortunately, the love story is complicated, but there is a happy ending of some sort  I suppose. I cannot really say I followed too closely, because I fell asleep half way into the movie. This is something that almost never happens to me, unless the movie is really boring, and in this case I can confirm this movie is so incredibly boring that it does not even feel like an original movie. More like a patch-up job of countless ""rebirth"" stories. Weirdly enough, Jeff Bridges looks a lot like Kris Kristofferson, more than like his handsome self. Since I hate country-western I did not even appreciate the music. Maggie Gyllenhaal is the female star of the movie, the young mother who helps Jeff resurrecting. She is also supposed to be a great actress, but I cannot understand why. I am starting to get tired of her chipmunk cheeks and her perennial half smile – suggesting she is seductive but also approachable, or whatever. I would not describe her as having any star appeal. In fact, I am avoiding anything she is in. Conclusion: Jeff Bridges deserved an Oscar, but not for this kind of junk. Coming from a Jeff Bridges fan, this is some statement."
"joker-4","9","3","4","11 July 2012"," Pick up your Crazy Heart
","Country music, and I mean good, soulful music that both comes from and punches you in the heart, often tells an honest story, sometimes exaggerated. That story can have ups and downs, tell tales of love lost and love found, even for one night, and probably makes more than one reference to drinking all night, bowling alley bar assumed. This good, raw music helps tell the story of one Bad Blake, who epitomizes that cowboy soundtrack, and no one other than Jeff Bridges could pull off such a character study as found in Scott Cooper's CRAZY HEART.<br/><br/>Bad is a living cliché. In his prime his stature would have made him a contemporary of the Highwaymen and his charisma certainly a welcome addition – as it stands, Bridge's Oscar-worthy performance eases together elements of both Kris Kristofferson and Waylon Jennings. But his prime is now well good and done and he consigned to playing bowling alley bars with session bands that idolize the man looking past the fact that he's more a drunk than a singer. But then true love hits and his muse returns, as Maggie Gyllenhaal's plucky single-mom reporter, giving way to a new song. <br/><br/>Bridges IS the film and lays out Bad's life in a true train-wreck style. As off-the-rails he gets, though, the constant twinkle in his eye proves that he is a charmer and endears the viewer to the character. One of the provided insights is his relation to Colin Farrell's Tommy Sweet, a one- time Bad Blake protégé who is now playing to sold-out amphitheaters. Bridges shows a range of complex emotions from resentment over Sweet's popularity, anger at the distance they kept, and prideful awe recognizing that Sweet truly is a performer. Farrell supplies his wonder factor proving that this Irish bloke can sing country – well.<br/><br/>As with many character-driven movies, the narrative tale becomes a minor chord and plays itself out with the familiarity of other songs. Instead of the typical elevator story of found fame - lost fame – regained fame, CRAZY HEART begins at the bottom and sinks lower before getting back to ground level. The progression of the man, however, the heart, is much more important that the trappings of a three-act format. To quote Bad, that's the way it is with good ones, you're sure you've heard them before. CRAZY HEART, and Jeff Bridge's Bad Blake, is among the best."
"MartinHafer","9","3","4","15 January 2012"," Bridges is THE movie.
","This movie is similar in many ways to ""Tender Mercies"" and it is interesting that Robert Duvall appears in each. However, in ""Crazy Heart"", Jeff Bridges plays the lead and unlike Duvall's character in ""Tender Mercies"", Bridges character is an alcoholic in the midst of a long decline--not a man trying to pick up the pieces like Duvall did in this earlier performance. So, in some ways, it's like looking at Duvall's character a bit before the story begins in ""Tender Mercies"". Both characters are alcoholic country singers and both leave behind a lot of messed up lives and hope to somehow rebuild theirs. But Bridges isn't yet ready to give up the booze and smoking--and it's slowly killing him.

Part of it is because he sang his own music--it wasn't dubbed. And, it sounded a lot like Waylon Jennings--quite good in a raspy sort of way. Part of it was because Bridges just did a darn good job playing a likable but pathetic drunk. The following year, he also went on to a nice performance in the remake of ""True Grit""--showing that in his older years, Bridges is actually doing some of his very best work. Well worth seeing--an excellent character study in every respect.<br/><br/>By the way, I really, really liked the way this film ended. Instead of going for the easy, clichéd Hollywood ending, they chose to wrap it up extremely well and realistically. See the film--see what I mean."

","Country and Western music has spawned many a singing legend. Those who's names we remember, are synonymous with there musical hits which are embedded in the memories of their fans. It easy to recall your favorites whenever one hears one of their classic tunes. In this movie written and directed by Scott Cooper is called "" Crazy Heart "" is from the novel of the same name, by Thomas Cobb. Jeff Bridges stars as 'Bad Blake' an aging, fading Country and Western singer/songwriter who is regretfully existing on the dwindling admiration he once commanded. His sinking life has become a hazy collection of chain cigarettes, boozing nights and one night stands. Although, close friends try and prop him up, hoping he will change, Blake insist he can make it on his own, despite the fact he is on a downward spiral to oblivion. His salvation it seems appears when he meets Jean Craddock (Maggie Gyllenhaal) a struggling reporter and her young son, who takes a liking to Blake. In addition to Robert Duvall who plays Wayne and Colin Farrell who plays 'Tommy Sweet' adds sympathy and compassion to a superior and heartfelt story. Easily recommended. ****"

","Before I start - if you are into country (/blues, rock ... good music) or maybe even into guitar playing you'll probably like this film even morecause you can also connect more than others to its musical content. There is one unwritten rule if you are learning to play the guitar. ""If it feels/sounds right, it is right"". This is exactly what this picture is like.<br/><br/>This movie not necessarily features a very original plot for parts (well most of it) but its characters make it feel like that and even more; they make it feel real.<br/><br/>I can tell Jeff Bridges' Oscar was well deserved. He is a special actor. For sure I never got/get to him personally (though I'd love to) but he seems to be such a great person and his acting is not from a lesser quality.<br/><br/>Jeff Bridges (perfectly cast) plays an old country musician Bad Blake whose great times are already gone. His career goes downhill and it's been years since he last wrote a new song. He is alcoholic and alone. On his trip through the states he is playing in small clubs in small towns - one of them is Santa Fe, Texas. Here he meets a young reporter played by Maggie Gyllenhall. She has a son but has never been happy with a man yet. She likes Bad a lot but has also doubts because of his alcoholism and fears about her son. Bad on the other hand feels like a father for the first time. Collin Ferell appears as Tommy, Bad's guitar student in earlier days and now far more successful than his old mentor. But he has not forgotten what Bad had done for him so he asks Bad to go on tour together and if he could write songs for him. Some new steps there to take for Bad, and he wants to do the right things, he is a good guy. But will some of his decision be too late? And will all soon be good again for him ... ?<br/><br/>It's a slow but never boring experience that always feels fresh. It moves from one good scene to another and always when you fear it is gonna lose it in the next minute we get a new piece of information, a new characteristic trait and it really works the whole movie through. There is no moment that feels like it was too long or had no substance.<br/><br/>These are lovable, three dimensional characters and we really care for them. We even get a little Robert Duvall in there.<br/><br/>On top of that of course there is high quality dialog that also delivers some wisdoms for life.<br/><br/>We got some funny moments, some sad moments and some moments of happiness... and none of them feel forced at any time.<br/><br/>The music written explicitly for the film - and actually really performed by the actors themselves - is beautiful and makes it round. Yet another the academy award! I already got the best tracks at home!<br/><br/>Finally the best argument that I can give you to see this movie is that after the end it left me feeling happy and satisfied and I kept sitting and listing to the music until the end of the credits ...

","Though there is nothing wrong with the typical action film, it's always nice to see a well-made drama which features strong performances and an awards-worthy script. Crazy Heart is a film about an alcoholic country singer, played by Jeff Bridges, looking for a second chance in his career and his life. Part of this second chance arrives in the form of Maggie Gyllenhaal, who plays a sweet, earnest single mother who works as a journalist. During an interview for her magazine, the two fall in love with each other, even though she knows that enduring his alcoholism and irresponsibility may hurt her in the long run. The various concert scenes throughout the film are vibrant, engaging, and make you feel as if you are actually there. This first-time writer-director transforms a clichéd, somewhat bland story into an uplifting and meaningful film. Of course, the real highlight of this film is Jeff Bridges. He portrays the country singer near-perfectly both musically and acting-wise. He clearly knows how to avoid turning an over-the-top character into an over-the-top performance, making his on-screen presence seem natural and unforced. Maggie Gyllenhaal is also strong as the love interest, especially during the film's climax. Crazy Heart is a wonderful drama that deserves your attention."
"sme_no_densetsu","8","3","4","20 October 2010"," Bridges connects with ""Crazy Heart""
","""Crazy Heart"" is basically the country music version of Darren Aronofsky's ""The Wrestler"". Jeff Bridges plays an aging country music star whose best days are behind him. The abuse he's put his body through is catching up with him, which is only worsening matters. However, when he strikes up a relationship with a divorced journalist (Maggie Gyllenhaal) he makes an effort to turn his life around. But can he shed his old persona at this late stage of the game?<br/><br/>Despite being thematically quite similar to ""The Wrestler"" (which only came out a year earlier), ""Crazy Heart"" brings some new elements to the table. The country music background gives the film its flavour even though the plot points are mostly shopworn. The script also seems a bit aimless at times but, in the long run, it keeps the audience interested.<br/><br/>The acting goes a long way in selling the story. Jeff Bridges won an Academy Award for his performance and I wouldn't argue with that. Meanwhile, Maggie Gyllenhaal is luminous as always and was rewarded with the first Oscar nomination of her career. Colin Farrell & Robert Duvall both have small supporting roles and the rest of the cast, while lacking recognizable names, is well-assembled.<br/><br/>Scott Cooper's first time direction is solid and the film looks attractive throughout. Musically, the film excels. The Oscar-winning song ""The Weary Kind"" is but one of a handful of original tunes featured. These are performed by Jeff Bridges & Colin Farrell, both of whom contribute respectable performances.<br/><br/>In the end, while ""Crazy Heart"" ends up on the losing end of the inevitable comparison with ""The Wrestler"" it still contains enough to make it a worthwhile viewing experience. You don't really need to be a country music fan in order to enjoy the film but I guess it would help."

","First-time director Scott Cooper also co-writer of this rather poor story. As a matter of fact, the opening scenes were so slow and uninteresting that I almost turned the film off....stuck with it only because I was interested in seeing Jeff Bridges Academy Award performance.<br/><br/>Jeff Bridges, who was also involved in the production of this film, sang quite well including the award-winning song. Maggie Gyllenhaal, gave a very strong performance, she certainly deserved the nomination to best supporting actress. Robert Duvall acted well as ""Bad's"" friend; and Colin Farrell sang surprisingly well, as good any country singer I have heard thus far.<br/><br/>However, the story was not particularly interesting, it is a bit too rehashed after ""Walk the Line"" this story is a rather poor depiction of a drinking country singer. I am not a fan of country music, but this time I did put the subtitles and read the words of the songs which were a bit better than the melodies themselves. The accompanying musicians played rather well. The delivery by Jeff Bridges was superb, and not surprisingly so, since I once heard him interviewed saying that music was part of his family life with his father. Was much more impressed with Jeff Bridges in the film ""The Fabulous Baker Boys"" in which he played the piano and sang too, I thought that he should have gotten the award for that movie rather than ""Crazy Heart""."
"Likes_Ninjas90","8","3","4","15 October 2010"," Regardless of the conventional nature of the narrative it is the sensational Oscar nominated performance by Jeff Bridges that truly sparks this film
","Crazy Heart is the first film directed by Scott Cooper and while it offers a relatively light and familiar story, it still makes for easy and engaging viewing. The film's narrative is indeed highly similar to that of The Wrestler. This is also about a man who has lost the need to care for himself and begins to physically deteriorate because of his unhealthy habits and lifestyle choices. They are also similar because of the problematic inclusion of a woman and their unlikely relationship, as well as the last chance for redemption, with a final career prospect arising. However, this picture does not enforce the same power and dramatic edge as Darren Aronofsky's work, because aside from some stressful scenes towards the end and some raw emotion shown, not a lot happens dramatically throughout Crazy Heart. It is a much lighter film because it is just not as painfully involving. This might actually suit those who are looking for a story which is less grim though.<br/><br/>Yet regardless of the conventional nature of the narrative it is the sensational Oscar nominated performance by Jeff Bridges that truly sparks this film. The amount of detail in this character, from his bushy look to his funny quips and mannerisms, is indicative of the great efforts that Cooper spent thoroughly writing such an interesting and fun persona. One of the first sights we see of Bad is when he is exiting his beaten up old truck with his belt undone and then pouring his own urine from a container on the ground. Similarly, as he sits in just his towel, eating from a Styrofoam container, he announces that he is having dinner when Jean accidentally walks in on him. These crude and funny moments are contrasted with his talents as a showman and a musician, which despite his complacency, have really never left him. When rehearsing he says that he will continue practicing throughout the entire concert unless the sound is fixed, revealing his experience with the industry and its occasionally dodgy practices. His fatal flaw remains his lack of drive though, which has prevented him for so long to do anything with his talents. When he is asked to make a new record he asks his manager what's wrong with his old stuff. Lastly, there is also the tenderness and the vulnerable side, which suggests that underneath his apparent emptiness there is still a man who cares and this is reflected most poignantly with his fondness for Buddy, showing him the love and attention that was absent from his relationship with his own son. Bridges understands this character thoroughly and he physically and emotionally embodies the role, humanising all of Bad's strengths and weaknesses so convincingly. His ability to perform his own singing in the film is just another asset his terrific performance provides for Crazy Heart. <br/><br/>Although there has been great discussion for Bridge's performance, Gyllenhaal is surprisingly affecting in the film too and was justly rewarded recently with a Best Supporting Actress nomination. She is terrific with her fleeting eyes suggesting her vulnerability and weakness for men. The emotion and fury she shows towards the end of the film is actually quite powerful. How much her son really means to her is also one of the most convincing aspects of her performance, with Buddy being the one last reliable male in Jean's life. It is a shame given the quality of both performances then that the relationship between Bad and Jean is slightly less plausible. Their attraction is not only rapid but it comes at a time when Jean insists that she is not making the same mistakes anymore. Perhaps this is just a reflection of her helplessness and poor judgement in men but it could have been made slightly clearer. Robert Duvall and Colin Farrell have smaller roles and they are both fine actors too, the latter a surprisingly good singer. Crazy Heart's soundtrack was arranged by the musician T. Bone Burnett, who has worked on a number of other films such as Walk the Line and Across the Universe and it is impressive as well. Two of the very best songs are 'Hold on You' and the touching ballad 'The Weary Kind', which is played over the end credits.<br/><br/>Crazy Heart is not a particularly original or fresh film, but it is certainly one that is highly enjoyable and fun to watch because of the multilayered performance by Bridges that really elevates the film. The attention to detail in the writing of his character is highly impressive, as is his ability to convince us of this very talented has- been. Yet Gyllenhaal is also particularly moving, eventually bringing a great deal of emotion into a more ordinary character. She provides the film with the dramatic punch that it needs towards the end. It is these two performances, along with the music, which makes the formulaic narrative here memorable once more."

","Crazy Heart, a sentimental look at an aging country singer just trying to git along, is richly rendered, immersing the viewer into a cigarette- smoke-laced, beer-soaked landscape of podunk bars and whiskey jars. Galvanized by an Oscar-winning performance by Jeff Bridges as Bad Blake, the world-weary crooner who's seen better days, the movie is a few notches above the standard rags-to-riches story (particularly because there are hardly any riches), with a finale that's both understandable and unpredictable. Jeff Bridges is a crusty, cranky old drunk here, sort of exactly like the broken-down piece of meat that Mickey Rourke was in The Wrestler. And like Randy the Ram, Bad Blake has a run-in with a younger woman; in this case, she's younger than Marisa Tomei was to Rourke. She's Jean Craddock, a local newspaper reporter, played by the always effervescent Maggie Gyllenhaal (who's terrific here). Like Tomei's character, Craddock has a kid and has weathered tough relationships. (It's set in the Southwest, where movie womenfolk seem to make multiple bad relationship decisions.) Jean falls for the oddly endearing Bad, and a long-distance relationship is born.<br/><br/>Bridges is one of those actors who seems just plain awesome in everything. I mean, the man's fun to watch, whether he's The Dude, The President, the bad guy in The Vanishing, a lounge singer, even a comic- book villain. His effortless charisma carries even the most lightweight of movies, and perhaps that's something that's worked against him over the course of his career. Crazy Heart was his fifth nomination and his first win, so it's not as if he's never been recognized, but because he's so good at disappearing into roles and because he takes the crap movies along with the meaty ones, maybe Hollywood's been taking him for granted. Oh, but not now. Bridges' Bad Blake is both unbelievably strong and weak, a man beholden to the bottle but desperate for love. Against his better instincts, honed over a very long middling career, he falls for Jean and her little boy in return.<br/><br/>The movie could have taken a few shortcuts and called it a day, and it didn't, and for that it deserves a lot of respect. Colin Farrell plays a singer who got his start from Blake years ago and is trying to repay the favor. A lesser movie might show Blake all bitter about the younger man's success, but it's not so here. A lesser movie might also show anger and resentment from ol' Bad Blake, just trying to keep on keepin' on, only to culminate in a not-at-all-shocking concert that somehow saves his career, but this one doesn't do that, either.<br/><br/>I think one of my favorite aspects, though, is how well the two leads played off each other. Maggie Gyllenhaal is 33 years old, and Bridges is 61, but you'd never know it watching the two of them together. Oh, sure, he does present as an older man, but not almost 30 years older. Their connection is palpably strong and a wonder to behold.<br/><br/>It also helps a lot that the songs – some performed by Bridges and Farrell themselves – are real toe-tappers, excellent – pardon the pun – stage setters. Whether Blake's playing in a bowling alley or before 12,000 fans as an opening act, he and his tunes are genuine country, solid American entertainment.<br/><br/>Blake, like Rourke's Ram, is not an entirely sympathetic man; he's not even a man who's made bad decisions in the past and suddenly begins to make good ones. He's a good man, yes, but trapped by a device of his own design. It's not even a certainty, over the course of the movie, whether he will come out on top in the end – or whether he deserves to. And that's a testament to both Bridges' tremendous, career-defining work and to a top-notch script by director Scott Cooper, who adapted Thomas Cobb's novel."

","What a great example of what can pull you into a film.<br/><br/>Storywise, it is a pretty tired deal: ruined life, redeemed life through romantic encounter. Along the way you get to see the lows of the ruin and highs of the redeeming love. Such a thing is either so ordinary that it is worthless, or so bland that you can layer all your attractive tricks. It is like runway models. The dynamic there is that the women by themselves are supposed to have no appeal whatever. Add some clothes designed to catch to catch the mysteries of womanhood, and the woman comes alive. It is subtle effect that universally works.<br/><br/>The ""narrative fold"" here is nested in this phenomenon. This man needs love, so we reinforce the urges behind the romance. Gyllenhaal makes it easy by being simply appealing, and visibly going along. We are not supposed to identify with the old loser, but the young admirer. <br/><br/>But there are other devices at work here, so many that the film is overloaded. But I guess that will work at the box office and award circuit. One of them is something I have remarked on many times: the explicit fold. We are watching a performance with highlights of a life, of a man whose profession is performing highlights of his character's life. The inner performance is perfectly aligned with the outer by the songs, carefully crafted in tone and lyrics.<br/><br/>We have a second admirer. The woman loves him for the character in the middle of the fold, the guy in the movie. A character played by folded acting genius Colin Farrell admires him for the man in the fold (the inner character of the songs) and barely tolerates him as the character himself. Farrell, we will all know, is redeemed himself from substance abuse. <br/><br/>And we have another rather common ""fold."" Bridges is fantastic. We are watching the character (self-named ""Bad"") only 20% of the time. The rest of the time we are watching Bridges play this guy. He uses actorly devices that we know are such. The young director frames these devices in camera angles that make us very aware that it is a movie, and that daredevil skills are on display. We don't fall in love with Bad; we fall in love with Bridges.<br/><br/>All that is old. What's newish is the use of the landscape. We are told in the first few seconds that this will be the case: we see the open haggard beauty of the place in a couple shots with major guitar chords, then a strong minor one and the coloring changes to dark, and the focal point moves out. Where in another film we see the characters, here we first see the landscape.<br/><br/>I first noticed the engineered use of the open and the close in ""Proof of Life,"" but I suppose it was already a known device there. ""Lone Star"" was a sort of high point in western film, using the same sense of place, but having imposed times in the same shot. Here, with the precisely engineered songs, it is the real novelty and skill of the thing.<br/><br/>Duvall was responsible for this, I believe.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."

Maggie Gyllenhaal was also excellent, she gave us a role full of energy.

","Every few years or so, some aging male star will take on the role of a broken-down has-been to remind us all of just how fine an actor he can be when he's given material that doesn't rely primarily on youth and good looks to get the job done. In 2008, it was Mickey Rourke who got to show off his acting chops in ""The Wrestler,"" and now it's Jeff Bridges' turn in ""Crazy Heart,"" playing a once-legendary, but now pot-bellied, whiskey-soaked country singer/songwriter - who goes by the stage name Bad Blake - who's so far past his prime that he's been reduced to performing in bowling alleys and two-bit bars just to stay financially afloat and to keep his name before the public. But, unlike Rourke, Bridges was actually rewarded with a Best Actor Oscar for all his pains. And, to top it off, he gets to sing too! (Quite well, actually).<br/><br/>Bridges certainly deserved his award for a performance that far transcends the stereotypes and clichés that might have foiled a lesser actor, and which lifts the movie to a plane it might otherwise never have achieved without him. The insightful, thoughtful screenplay by Scott Cooper (based on the novel by Thomas Cobb) plows some pretty familiar territory, but Bridges makes it all seem real and fresh. The same can be said for Maggie Gyllenhaal, whose role as an attractive single-mother and local writer who becomes romantically involved with Blake after she pens a story on him could easily have become stale and trite. Instead, these two fine actors play off one another so effectively that we forget we've seen this setup umpteen times before. The relationship between the two uncovers many truths about a man who's so enslaved to the bottle that he has never really grown up into a fully functioning, responsible adult - and his growing awareness that it may be high time he took some concrete steps towards rectifying that situation.<br/><br/>Another interesting, though less fully developed, relationship in the movie is the one between Blake and Tommy Sweet, a hot young singer (superbly played by Colin Farrell, who does his own performing as well) who, although he originally started as Blake's protégée, now enjoys the celebrity status and critical acclaim that once were Blake's for the taking.<br/><br/>As directed by Cooper, the movie nicely captures the look and feel of both the dusty Southwest countryside in which it's set and the seedy bars and cheap motel rooms where a good deal of the indoor action takes place.<br/><br/>With its world-class performances (throw Robert Duvall into that mix), intelligent writing and sensitive direction, ""Crazy Heart"" has all the down-home wisdom and blues-driven heartache of a good ole country tune."

He is gruff, sensitive, sad, all those things, but what he is mostly is believable. I grew up with drunks and knew so many others. They are often so pathetic because they often want so badly to be what they are not. Bad is all these things. He makes huge mistakes but his buddy is the bottle; it's his best friend. Maggie Gyllenhaal is cute and vulnerable and true to form. She has been burned so often but takes one more chance. The results are the way results should be.

","This is movie perfection. I'll take a character-driven story over the TRANSFORMERS any day. But I AM picky! CRAZY HEART is a parallel movie to THE WRESTLER from last year, and I think it is the better film. Both deal with the fictional stories of middle-aged men who found moderate success in the entertainment careers of their younger years, but now have to deal with the issues their younger selves never foresaw (or purposely avoided.) How do they deal with dwindling fame, financial hardship, grown children and loneliness? You will see all this in the expertly written, acted and directed CRAZY HEART. Add to this an awesome soundtrack of original songs performed beautifully by Bridges and Farrell (their duet actually gave me goose bumps!) An overall excellent and very entertaining film. I especially like the low-key ""cliffhangers"": will boozed-up Blake remember the names of a couple to whom he has promised a dedication? Will the liquor store owner comp a bottle of whiskey that Blake can't afford? There are many nice subtle touches throughout. The director deservedly won Best First Feature at the INDEPENDENT SPIRIT AWARDS this year."

","As difficult as it is to articulate the 'flavour' of a particular artistic genre or style, even more challenging is it to transpose such a sense into another artistic medium altogether. Yet the genius of writer/director Scott Cooper's Crazy Heart is its ability to do just that, embodying and epitomizing the spirit of country music through the medium of cinema. As such, the resulting film falls prey to the same strengths and weaknesses of its musical genre of choice: predicated on a simplistic, familiar riff, yet etched with deep sorrow and resonant human sentiment, drawing strength and stoic comfort through its determination to stick to the tried and true, thus offering little not seen before but offering it well indeed.<br/><br/>The plot, often dismissed as ""2009's The Wrestler"", does indeed bank on the same skeletal narrative template as Mickey Rourke's equally Oscar-baiting offering of flawed, washed up yet redemptive masculinity, itself already precariously skirting the line of tiresome cliché. Yet Cooper finds solemn poignancy in in the familiarity, using his film as a gentle ballad which, rather than attempting to 'explain' faded country superstar 'Bad' Blake or unearth the reasons behind his decline, simply presents him as is. As such, Crazy Heart is less character study than character portrait, allowing the audience to fill in the blanks and determine Bad's morality or motivation without unnecessary directorial annotation. <br/><br/>In fact, in many ways Cooper's film excels at taking it slow and loose, adapting a relaxed, unhurried style and pace for the sake of allowing the viewer to drink in the intricacies of Blake's increasingly decrepit life, albeit one which makes the final film drag and feel somewhat overlong for such a simple premise (an added 'romance as redemption' subplot functions mostly as padding). However, as one would imagine, the film thrives as a performance piece, not only in terms of acting but also musically, and the film's country soundtrack infuses it with an earthy weight and presence, thankfully forgoing the standard Hollywood sheen for a clunkier credibility. <br/><br/>That being said, the show show belongs to Jeff Bridges, and his 'Bad' Blake feels just as fully realized and genuine a piece of characterization as has graced the cinema in years. His crinkled face etched with the trials of hard living and encapsulating the film's unshowy, rough and warmly genuine feel through his performance, Bridges bleeds every ounce of charisma, ruffled charm and pathos into his down and out musician, ushering in a performance frustrating to sympathize with yet impossible not to understand, and easily deserving every ounce of accolades. The rest of the cast provide conventional stock characters with earthy authenticity. Maggie Gyllenhaal compellingly blends laid back warmth with a wounded guardedness as the single mother reporter whose life becomes increasingly entwined with Blake's, despite her struggling to generate a performance standing out amidst the inherent cliché of her character. Colin Farrell shines in his few scenes, bringing an understated flashiness to Blake's musical protégée, now a country superstar, and Robert Duvall brings a stoic warmth to Blake's bartender buddy, both mercifully resisting the temptation to chew scenery evidently designated for Bridges.<br/><br/>Even without its array of compelling performances, particularly the evident draw of Bridges, Crazy Heart would manage to overcome its inherently familiar nature with simple, honest storytelling ensconced with genuine weight and poignancy. While far from a cinematic revelation, the film's unassuming ambitions combined with genuine sentiment make the film a winner for what it is, and one song easily worth giving a reflective listen to.<br/><br/>-7.5/10"

","Crazy Heart is a great movie, based chiefly on the its great performances. This story of a down and out country star fighting alcoholism, and the bad choices he makes is a story of personal redemption if not personal triumph. Jeff Bridges was very deserving of his Oscar nod as Bad Blake. Bridges takes Blake through life experiences ranging from an his lips drunk to the edge of doom, and back again. Maggie Gyllenhall is also very good as the younger woman who falls for Blake's charms, until it becomes apparent that Blake is not able to properly care for himself let alone her or her young son. I was also very impressed Colin Farrel as Blake's younger and extremely successful protégé. Robert Duvall also gets the nod for another fine performance in his impressive resume.<br/><br/>The story avoids the superficial happy ending. Blake's triumph is over his own demons, though he doesn't win the big prize at the end."

","Crazy Heart is the tale of Bad Blake, a washed-up country singer, who's life is transformed by the woman he falls in love with.<br/><br/>It's a simple story. We've heard it all before, and in theory, it has 'boring' written all over it. Well, it's true, there's not much action. And it's also true that at the half-way mark I was wondering what they were going to fill the next hour with. That turned out to be not very much, but it didn't really matter.<br/><br/>It takes a great actor to carry a film to the point where you don't really care what, if anything, happens, because you just want to hang out with him. Even if he all he does is sit down and drink beer, you'll still be watching. Jeff Bridges in the lead role of Bad Blake carries it off. You might remember him from 'The Big Lebrowski' (if you don't, you've missed another great film). More than ten years on, he hasn't lost his touch. Like Mickey Rourke in 'The Wrestler', he's on screen in almost every scene, and like Mickey Rourke, he's riveting.<br/><br/>Maggie Gyllenhaal (she was apparently in 'Away We Go' but I don't remember her), plays the love interest, Robert Duvall has a couple of great scenes and tasty Colin Farrell is thrown in for good measure.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is also worth a mention. As you might expect from a film about a country singer, it's country music all the way. But don't let that put you off. It's pretty darn good.<br/><br/>The 'The Wrestler' meets '200 Days of Summer' with a bit of' 'Leaving Las Vegas' thrown in. No guns, nobody gets shot, nobody dies, and I cried, just a bit, at the end. This is my kind of film."
"J_Trex","10","4","8","15 February 2010"," Best Movie of the Year
","I just saw this movie for the 2nd time yesterday, and I enjoyed it even more than the first. The performances by the supporting cast were awesome, with Robert Duvall in a great role as ""Bad"" Blake's friend, helping him overcome his alcoholism. The other minor roles, mostly of Blake's devoted fans and fellow musicians, really made this a great movie. Of course, Jeff Bridges as ""Bad"" Blake was outstanding and should be the runaway favorite to win Best Actor. But he had great material and a stellar cast helping him out.<br/><br/>Why this movie did not make it onto the expanded list of Best Movie Oscar nominations is baffling. Was it too ""Red State"" for the mostly liberal movie critics that comprise the Academy? They didn't overlook Jeff Bridges or Maggie Gyllenhall for their performances (for Best Actor & Best Supporting Actress) and it rec'd a nod for Best Music. But why not Best Picture? Or Screenplay? The entire story was very well written, the cinematography was outstanding, with excellent panoramic scenes of the western US, the music scenes were all perfectly choreographed, even when ""Bad"" Blake was too drunk to stand, and the character development was pitch perfect. As good as Bridges was as Blake, the writing had much to do with his ability to connect with the movie goer. This was some very excellent screen writing and deserved an original screenplay nod. <br/><br/>A truly worthwhile movie experience and should most definitely have been nominated for Best Picture. Go see this gem."
"Robert_duder","9","4","8","7 February 2010"," An incredibly powerful performance moves this film to greatness
","Crazy Heart is simply beautiful. Its touching and heartfelt and sad and perhaps brilliantly made. 99% of this rests squarely on the shoulders of the Globe, SAG etc. winning performance by Jeff Bridges who is brilliant but I'll get to that. This is a simple story about a very complex man with a history that they unfold gradually by showing where he has arrived now. One thing I normally can't stand is when they put a young actress with old men stars like Harrison Ford, Bruce Willis, Clint Eastwood etc. (three of my favorite actors mind you) and they sort of do the same in Crazy Heart but there is a major difference because somehow it fits the story. The infamous former star ""Bad"" Blake is a former womanizer with an oozing charm and the woman he wins over has come from a string of bad relationships and probably has some sort of ""Daddy"" issues so the whole dysfunction aspect works in this case. The music in the film is really the heart of the movie and very sweet. Some very original and beautiful even haunting old time country music. My Dad raved about this film and its easy to see why as he comes from the school of country of George Jones and Johnny Cash and Hank Williams and this film encompasses all of that and the new as well.<br/><br/>Let's talk Jeff Bridges. The man is quickly becoming, if he isn't already, an icon of acting. But this role is simply breathtaking. So far out of the Best Actor nominees this isn't even a competition. I only have two more to see and I'd be awfully surprised if anyone comes even close to Bridges. His performance is incredibly moving, emotional, sad, and brilliant. He will make you love, hate, and pity the legendary Bad Blake all while believing beyond doubt this man was a star. Maggie Gyllenhaal plays Bridges' love interest, a single mother who has clearly had a tough life especially with guys. This is one of the best roles I have ever seen Gyllenhaal in and she looks great! Her and Bridges have great chemistry both romantically but also as actors play off of each other. Bridges' performance is so outstanding that it would seem hard to play against him but she holds her own. Small almost cameo roles by Robert Duvall and Colin Farrell round out the cast. Both give really great performances. I was actually very impressed with Farrell and his singing as the hot new rock/country singer. He is incredibly believable.<br/><br/>And this is what this film is about...believability. The story, and the characters just draw you into their lives like you're watching real life unfold before you. Bit part actor Scott Cooper has hit some kind of gold as the writer and director of Crazy Heart. His talent must lie in writing because this is just a brilliant story. I fully expected the film to end poorly given that the film is at times very nearly depressing and sad overtones throughout and instead remarkably the film ends not with a picture perfect happy ending but a very solid touching, well thought out ending. The key is that clearly Cooper put his heart and soul into this and never stopped for a moment to make things easy or entertaining but instead made the film entertaining and just a very touching movie. This is a film I could see again and again and love every time. Out of all the Academy Award films this season...Crazy Heart is an absolute must see!! 9/10"

","This film is about a country musician who is way past his glory days. He is an alcoholic, wasting his life away until an encounter with a journalist.<br/><br/>I had high hopes for ""Crazy Heart"", thinking it would be touching and engaging. It turns out that it was neither. The story is quite unbelievable, especially Bad Blake and Jean's relationship. They meet for a few minutes and then they fall in love, despite their obvious differences in just about everything. I just cannot get into this unlikely story. In addition, lighting is a big problem. In pivotal scenes such Bad Blake and Jean's second interview, the lighting source is poorly placed. We only get to see the actors hair or back, but their eyes are covered in shadows of their forehead. It was as if I was watching a horror film, where I see a face with two black patches where the eyes are supposed to be. I was bored by ""Crazy Heart"", and I don't see what's so good about it."

","This film could draw comparisons to Tender Mercies-in fact, Robert Duvall was in both of them! Jeff Bridges plays a faded country singer who is fading in life too. He gets one more chance in romance (he had a bunch of failed marriages) with reporter Maggie Gylenhaal) but starts to blow this one too with a classic scene with her son.<br/><br/>I think this deserves the Oscars it got. Jeff Bridges certainly gave a terrific performance, and Collin Ferrell was good in his role, as was Maggie. The concert scenes were way above average and the main highlight. The excessive cigarette smoking might have been a bit much, but I think you can get past that.<br/><br/>*** out of ****"
"tomgillespie2002","7","2","3","1 March 2011"," Great love-song to the world of country music
","It was a rare heartwarming moment for me during the 2010 Oscars when Jeff Bridges won the Best Actor award and received a standing ovation from his colleagues and peers a like. He is an actor that was seemingly never going to receive the kind of recognition and status to which he so fully deserved. His films have ranged from computer game-film hybrid nerd-fest Tron, to Peter Bogdanovich's masterpiece (and one of my all- time favourite films) The Last Picture Show. After winning the award for this film, he seems to have been bumped up to the A-list, receiving another nomination this year for the exceptional True Grit. The film is pretty damn good too, surprisingly.<br/><br/>I say surprisingly as the story of an over-the-hill country singer seeking redemption seems like Oscar bait to me, but I found it a rather uplifting experience, and a piece of quality drama. Bridges plays the legendary Bad Blake, who, when we meet him, is emptying a bottle of his own p**s onto the car park floor upon his arrival at a bowling alley where he is due to play his next gig. He has returned to his home, and the locals are excited to see him sing some of his classic tunes and live up to his bad boy name. Yet he is unhappy. He spends his time on his own in his fleapit motel room, drinking his favourite whisky and chain-smoking cigarettes, and arguing with his hard-working manager who is keen to buddy him up with his protégé Tommy Sweet (Colin Farrell). There is unspoken resentment from Blake for Sweet, who seems to be highly successful while Blake wallows in misery, his time long since past. However, Blake seems to be awoken from his self-destructiveness when he is interviewed by the daughter of a liquor store owner, Jean (Maggie Gyllenhaal), who is as taken by him as he is by her. Living up to his name, Bad is always one step from screwing it up, as his drinking becomes a bigger problem than he imagined.<br/><br/>The main strength of the film is the genuine unlikeability of Blake. He is rude, offensive and in his first performance in front of his home crowd, spends the majority of the time throwing up in a bin outside while his backing band plays an instrumental on a loop awaiting his return. He also drinks to excess, throwing away his ability and refusing to write new material due to his jealousy of a younger and more successful emergent in Sweet. As he opens up to Jean, we also discover he has a son he hasn't seen in well over a decade, and has possibly fathered more that he doesn't know about. During an uncomfortable and achingly sad scene, he phones up the mother of his son and is informed of her death, and finds out his son wants nothing to do with him. Describing the film, it actually sounds like something you would have seen in other films countless times, but here the script is written with such heart, and the performance are so great, that it doesn't matter.<br/><br/>Another highlight is the performance of Maggie Gyllenhall. I've long since been a fan since her turn in the excellent Secretary, and here she is better. Unfortunately she has been unfairly drowned out by the masterclass of Bridges. She is both brittle and strong, looking after her son as a single mother, and being unable to resist the charms of Blake while always being aware of the danger of falling for someone like him. In a scene where she admits their relationship is an accident waiting to happen, Gyllenhaal's face is torn up by resentment and defeated sadness.<br/><br/>For a film with so much music, this could have fallen flat on it's face. But within the trusted care of music legend T-Bone Burnett, who has worked with the Coen brothers on a number of occasions, and Ryan Bingham, the music and the on-stage performances of Bridges are electric. The pair won the Oscar for Original Song, for the wonderful 'The Weary Kind', which Blake writes at the start of his road to redemption.<br/><br/>A great love-song to the world of country music and the legends that have eclipsed the genre, as well as being a good story very well told.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"
"Enchorde","8","2","3","21 February 2011"," Just stellar acting
","This is one of the movies that could end up really bad, or really good, depending on the actors and actresses in it. But with Jeff Bridges and Maggie Gyllenhaal, supported by Colin Farrell and Robert Duvall among others, it really never could go wrong, could it? Even with the expectations from all the high praise that comes with Crazy Heart, it still manages to surprise me. Not with any surprising plot twists, but with how heartfelt the story is. Simply put, how good it is.<br/><br/>Jeff Bridges plays the ageing country star Bad Blake. But his career has stalled, well, hit rock bottom is more like it. The former star is now playing bowling alleys, while the big stage is set for younger talents like Tommy Sweet. His personal life is pretty much rock bottom too. He's alone, alcoholic, and quite grumpy and bitter. But a chance meeting with a younger woman, a struggling reporter, Jean, might be the turnaround.<br/><br/>Bridges performance is just stellar. He needs to carry the story on his shoulders, and he does it so well. He got an intensity that I haven't seen before from him. He is perfectly cast as Bad Blake and makes this could be unpleasant character instead very human. I really got to care about him. Bridges is very well deserving of his Oscar.<br/><br/>I think Maggie Gyllenhaal is well deserving of an Oscar for her performance as well. She is really good in roles such as these and makes Jean come through as the strong single mother and at the same time the very vulnerable and searching woman. Colin Farrell surprises with a small but nice role as Tommy as well. A little surprisingly Tommy is not the hot shot ungrateful diva. On the contrary, Tommy cares very much for his old mentor and tries his best to support the old star. Farrell also surprises with a quite good singing voice.<br/><br/>This is a movie that should be watched for the actors, and their performances. The story is good, and got some uniqueness of its own. Perhaps best is that it got its own version of the happy ending. But the story would have been nothing without the acting.<br/><br/>8 crazy hearts out of 10."
"Jona1988","8","2","3","8 February 2011"," Jeff Bridges is amazing!
","Jeff Bridges does his absolutely best performance ever in Crazy Heart. He is really so good the film is worth seeing even if you have no real interest in it any other ways. Maybe someone could point out that the story doesn't really deliver anything that hasn't been done before. I can agree with that to some extent but with this film it doesn't matter, Crazy Heart is so well done. The characters are all great achievements, somewhat thanks to directing and script but the acting is what lifts the film to it's hight. Maggie Gyllenhaal and Colin Farrell manage to create characters that you become so interested in one sits on strict attention for the entire movie even if any big surprises remain absent from the plot. Even if it has many great aspects it is Jeff Bridges who carries the film. He really deserved the academy award for this. His character feels so real that under the films length of under 2h one gets a closer relation to him than few other can master. Maybe the story works so well because it is done in a so realistic way. It really feels like something that could be true and many times real life can lack surprising twists. I never get the feeling the plot is simple instead it feels like it's real. The film is sad and gripping. One comes to feel much for Jeff Bridges's character and the stuff he goes through. It is sad and a bit fun at the same time, a depressed dark humor. The feel-good kind of film. Even though like I stated it's not a film with lots of plot twists, but still I never sit thinking: I know what will come next, because it has such a soul I just want to see what happens to the gripping characters. The style and pace that it's told at is absolutely perfect for the story. The film is under 2h which is just enough, the film is at a low pace but not in a slow way rather I get the relaxing feel. Then the music which I loved so much. The songs are great and the performance by Bridges and Farrell are brilliant, very impressive! Crazy Heart is often a sad film, sometimes depressingly so but it's one that also makes you happy. However it has something more than the average feel-good film. I think one could say they have done much, very much with little. Crazy Heart really has a heart and a very deep soul."
"bkoganbing","8","2","3","31 January 2011"," Picking Up Your Life
","Crazy Heart was shot on a relatively small budget and in less than a month. But it proved to be one of those films that kind of sneaks up on the movie-going public. And you don't necessarily have to be a country and western fan to appreciate it.<br/><br/>Jeff Bridges stars and is essentially the whole show as an over the hill country and western icon who's reduced to playing cheap honky-tonks in those states where this music predominates. At one time he had a protégé, a Toby Keith like new country star played by Colin Farrell, but in those famous words from On The Waterfront, Bridges is riding on his one way ticket to Palookaville and the ride isn't finished.<br/><br/>Substance abuse has ruined this man's life and it actually looks like Farrell is going the same way if he doesn't watch himself. But Bridges meets up with young divorced journalist Maggie Gyllenhaal with a young son and a crisis with the young kid convinces Bridges he'd better mend his ways.<br/><br/>Supposedly Bridges modeled his Oscar winning performance on Kris Kristofferson. I saw that and a bit of Willie Nelson in Bridges on the screen. Whatever he did it sure worked because this is the role of a lifetime.<br/><br/>Besides the Best Actor Oscar that Jeff Bridges won, Crazy Heart has a nice score of country songs of which The Weary Kind won the film's second Oscar for Best Song. It's a good song on its own merits, but it also isn't like there's much to choose from in that category, hasn't been in a couple of generations.<br/><br/>And you don't have to be a fan of Jeff Bridges or country music to appreciate what a great little film Crazy Heart is."
"canviral","8","2","3","23 January 2011"," Fine, Indie as well as character study
","People have been complaining about the overabundance of big budget Hollywood blockbusters that are heavy on action, and explosions and don't focus on characters or plot. Crazy Heart should quiet some of the criticisms.<br/><br/>Jeff Bridges plays Bad Blake a Country Western star on the far end of his career. He was once a star with hit songs, albums people would buy and stadiums he could fill. Now he drags himself across the southwest in a car that could breakdown at any minute, playing whatever small gigs his agent can find with pick-up bands he fears are getting paid more than he is. He drinks so much he sweats whiskey. At one of his shows, small town reporter Jean Craddock (Maggie Gylenhaal) interviews him, and over a couple glasses of whiskey he falls for her. Despite her previous bad experiences with men she takes a chance on Bad. And for a while Bad vicariously experiences the family life he missed with his wife and child.<br/><br/>The relationship with Jean, which at first seems like the classic older leading man mismatch with the younger woman that wouldn't necessarily happen in real life. But Gylenhaal plays Jean that is desperate in her own way. She may not be at the end of her road like Bad is, but she definitely feels like she's backed into a corner, and the relationship between the two feels real.<br/><br/>Crazy Heart is as gently paced as a Country Western song. Colin Farrell appears in a nicely understated role as Tommy Sweet, a former protégé of Bad's who has hit the big time and is trying to help his former mentor out. Unfortunately, Bad resents Tommy's success and the opportunities he tries to steer Bad's way. Robert Duvall plays the voice of wisdom in Bad's life as his hometown bar owner. Bridges does his own singing in Crazy Heart and really works to the advantage of the character. Bridges' untrained voice exemplifies Bad's broken voice and broken life."

","I wasn't too sure about this one at first. I'm not a great fan of country music for a start, but I do know a good tune when I hear one and those guys at the Academy can't always be wrong, so I thought I'd give it a shot. I'm really glad I did! It's a really great film with some cracking songs and some truly great performances. But more of my praise later, here's a very brief summary first (summary haters please help unload the gear while I write the next paragraph - thanks).<br/><br/>Bad Blake is a country singer whose best days are behind him. He plays small bars, bowling alleys; anywhere he can get a gig really. Like many on hard times he has turned to alcohol to ease the pain, but it is clearly doing him no good. While playing in Santa Fe he meets journalist, Jean Craddock, who he begins a relationship with. She has a young son, Buddy, who takes to Bad and it seems things a looking up for the Country star. His agent calls him and tells him he has a gig in Phoenix, opening for his former protégé, and a very successful star, Tommy Sweet. At first he's hesitant, but finally agrees to do the show. He talks to Tommy and Tommy offers to help him out by paying for any new songs Bad has written. The trouble is Bad hasn't written any new material in quite a long time. On his way back to see Jean, Bad has an accident and is laid up for several weeks. During this time he begins to write again, but his alcoholism is about to rear its ugly head. Is Jean his salvation? Well, I guess that would be giving the game away, so I won't tell you here.<br/><br/>First of all the music, as I said at the beginning, I'm not a fan of Country music, but I do know a good tune when I hear one, and there are several on show here. The original songs by both Stephen Bruton and T-Bone Burnett are spot on. So good in fact that I bought the soundtrack album. One thing I did note was that there is no incidental music which I found made the film a little sparse. Lots of dialogue can get a bit tedious without anything to break it up. Having said that, I guess it makes the viewer appreciate the performances of the actors more.<br/><br/>I am not surprised that Jeff Bridges won the Oscar for Best Actor for his part as Bad Blake; he is truly excellent in this. I must also give praise to Maggie Gyllenhaal as Jean Craddock; I thought she was really good as well. I will also give honourable mentions to; Colin Farrell as Tommy Sweet and Robert Duvall as Bad's friend Wayne (he was also one of the Producers by the way). Both Jeff Bridges and Colin Farrell performed the songs themselves which, I think was, first of all, brave, and secondly, excellently done! Both could have a second career some day.<br/><br/>Over all, a really well made film with some great cinematography, the use of the landscape of New Mexico really stood out. Of course, the performances all round were excellent and only added to my enjoyment. It did fall a little flat in the third quarter where the story concentrates on the relationship between Bad and Jean, but I guess that's because there are no songs in that part. Having said that, this is still a film I would still recommend to anyone! If you haven't seen it, please do, it's well worth a look.<br/><br/>My score: 8.4/10"
"secondtake","7","2","3","16 August 2010"," Bridges is exactly what everyone says, and he lifts high an ordinary movie
","Crazy Heart (2009)<br/><br/>The story of a country singer down on his luck is about as old and legendary as them thar hills out yonder and yet, once again, it works. Jeff Bridges is a perfect fit here, acting with such sincerity you forget he isn't who he pretends to be, the old school singer Bad Blake. He drinks too much, he has women like other men have donuts, he loses track of his life, and his family, and someone else's kid, and generally of decency until he is forced to confront himself. In the background is the charming, cute, suave Colin Farrell as the new breed of country star, clearly a corporate product, but loved by the crowds.<br/><br/>What the story lacks in originality (and it lacks this almost completely) it makes up for in archetypal American loner survivalism on the road and on the mend. It's an enjoyable ballad of a movie, mostly for Bridges. Even when it gets slow, which it does too often, it's a pleasure to be in the company of Bad Blake. <br/><br/>The music: it's just the icing. Bridges (and Farrell, in his briefer role) performed their own songs, and the soundtrack is a great introduction to a certain kind of Country Western."
"MetalAngel","9","2","3","25 June 2010"," It shines through its simplicity and plucks at all the right chords.
","Let me write this right away, right after I've turned the DVD off and while the experience still lingers warmly in my mind. Oh, how I do love a good independent picture: quiet, subtle, but an emotional powerhouse fueled by a strong lead performance for which there are no words. Such is the description that immediately comes to mind for Scott Cooper's ""Crazy Heart"", a film that urges the viewer to accept a bittersweet shred of life and savour its tenderness and rawness equally.<br/><br/>The film is a fictional biopic of Bad Blake (Jeff Bridges) a once famous country singer who is well beyond his prime, whose career is reduced to playing on random bars and bowling alleys and who, at the age of 57, is forced to look back on his life and accept the fact he never amounted much to anything. The film's first scenes give you a breath-taking view of New Mexico's arid landscapes: beautiful, sparse, lonely and poetic...and these first images set the precise tone the film is gonna take. They will follow Bad through his minor, depressing gigs around the West, they'll see his life unravel under the influence of alcohol, and they will see his spirit rise to indescribably poignant levels after meeting a small-town journalist called Jean (Maggie Gyllenhaal), who's to become the most important lover he'll ever have and the catalyst that incites a major change in his personality, eventually leading him to become a better man.<br/><br/>Now, I'm not a big fan of biopics, especially if they deal with down-on-their-luck country singers and their booze addiction- we've seen too many of those, haven't we? There's not a single new thing to learn from yet another biopic peppered in country music. Well, that's wrong. This film came out last year and I immediately KNEW I wanted to stay away from it. Not even after Jeff Bridges won worldwide accolades and the film's theme song ""The Weary Kind"" started earning so much buzz did I think to care about it. A friend of mine got me a copy of the DVD some months ago and it had been sitting there in my shelf for quite some time without the slightest thought...until a lonely night like this found me wallowing in my boredom. I reached for the DVD, shot it into the player and, oh my God, was I prepared for the emotional tour-de-force! Jeff Bridges is heavenly perfection in this role...and that's too soft a word to credit his performance. My God, he inhabits Bad Blake in ways few actors have ever managed to make characters their own. We've seen him play a wide array of characters through his career (with films so extremely different like ""The Prince of Tides,"" ""The Big Lebowski,"" ""Masked and Anonymous"", etc.), and in most cases he manages to do a very good job with his characters...but there are just some roles you're BORN to play, and Bad Blake was his role. Bad is a man of few words, he's not a troublemaker, he's...well, he's your common Joe. He's REAL, he's a man I can assure you've met before. But how to make this man seem special, seem familiar, seem HUMAN in a two-hour and forty-seven minute film is no easy task. Screenplays can give an excellent characterization, great acting can give depth, great directing can make a character believable to us...but to make a character jump out of the screen, move you and treat you to such sharp pieces of life, and all through his normalcy, well that's the work of a genius, no less.<br/><br/>The plot of the film is something we've seen a million times before. Nothing unexpected happens; no huge or witty twists move the plot forward. The charm of it all is how life-like it all seems, how every gesture, every line, every character seems familiar and warms us to them. Life is never as interesting as Hollywood pictures make them out to be; life is never an intelligent social commentary or even a profound work of art...life is life: simple, hard, bittersweet and undeniably poignant. THAT'S what both critics and audiences love so much about ""Crazy Heart"": how, in its simplicity, it so faithfully projects life back at us, injecting our minds with the invigorating truths and heartaches that trouble us all. The center and heart of the film is Bad's relationship with Jean, and we root and cheer for them every second they're together and crave their return whenever they're apart; whenever something bad or sad happens to them, we feel just as bad as they do, because they're people we actually care about. They're real.<br/><br/>Not only the acting is excellent, but many other aspects of the film are too. I've already mentioned the beautiful landscapes, but the cinematography as a whole is very good too: it embraces the scene whatever the action therein may be- no camera tricks, no specialized lighting, no sweeping movements or dramatic dollies...it's straightforward and convincing. The music is excellent- the score is muted and the songs compliment the action on screen (especially the aforementioned Academy Award-winning 'The Weary Kind', which closes the entire film and the topics dealt therein in such subtle beauty that you can't help but weep at its message), the costume and production design are very good. And the screenplay is very, VERY good, featuring naturally-flowing dialogue and some believable, show-stopping one-liners (including the now legendary scene where Jean, beautiful and half-hidden under lamp light asks Bad what he's thinking about and he, after pondering a few seconds, struck by her beauty and by the dangerous topics the conversation is going through, answers ""I was just thinking how bad you make this room look, and I hadn't noticed that until you came here."").<br/><br/>See the film. Rating: 4 stars out of 4!!"

","Bad Blake (Jeff Bridges) is a sick, old, bum of a country singer whose better days are long gone. Reduced to one-nighters in bowling alleys, he stumbles through his shows in a drunken haze, but still knows how to please the groupies. On one stopover, he meets Jean (Maggie Gyllenhaal), a young reporter and single mother. Though she's been sorely disappointed by men before, the two begin an unlikely love affair.<br/><br/>I was prepared to dislike this movie, because I generally don't like slacker has-been characters. Bridges' Bad Blake is indeed an aimless loser, but it's impossible not to see his underlying vulnerability and I liked and cared about him. Bridges is completely believable as a singer and musician, looking and sounding very much like Kris Kristopherson on a bad day; he performs effortlessly and with the assurance of a pro. He is ably supported by the wonderful Ms Gyllenhaal who plays a sadder but wiser young woman and the always great Robert Duvall in a small but meaty role.<br/><br/>This movie is ultimately about redemption and would make good viewing at an AA meeting. The stellar cast and fine script make for a rewarding viewing experience."

","'Bad' Blake (Jeff Bridges), a down-and-out country artist gets involved with a young journalist (Maggie Gyllenhaal) and finds himself forced to reassess his life. CRAZY HEART is the debut film from director-writer Scott Cooper, and it's a solid film with an outstanding performance by a chain smoking and heavy drinking Jeff Bridges. When Gyllenhaal's character asks him where his songs comes from, he simply says ""life unfortunately"". Many proclaimed it to be 2009's THE WRESTLER, and as there are many similarities, this film doesn't have the same emotional resonance as Mickey Rourke's definitive film. But one of the great equalities, is the atmospheric milieu the actions take place, and Blake wanders around classic southwestern bars and motel rooms. The songs Blake plays are good, and they're written originally by Stephen Bruton and T-Bone Burnett. Other characters easily pales compared to Blake, but they all hold crafts and adds elements to Blake's flawed character. The direction seems to be floating in a worn out country heart of past and depressing present, and so the film doesn't seem to have a very distinct direction, but dialogs of plain simpleness and a careful pace makes it entertaining to the finale."

","""Crazy Heart"" had a lot of hype to live up to with all of the praise during the awards season and Jeff Bridges best actor Oscar win. Bridges plays the aptly named Bad Blake who despite a promising country music career is close to hitting rock bottom when the movie opens. He plays gigs in bowling alleys, drinks non stop and probably wakes up most mornings next to an aging groupie he does not even remember. Bridges flawlessly abandons vanity and lets his body show every indignity this type of lifestyle would bring to someone his age. The movie charts his doomed relationship with Jean, a journalist played by Maggie Gyllenhaal, and an eventual rise back to professional success and sobriety. I am a huge fan of Maggie Gyllenhaal but in this role I wonder what direction she was given or personal choices she was making, Her character is so vague that at the end of the movie, I could not have really have explained why she became involved with Bad so quickly or why she doesn't give him a second chance. My most pointed criticism is for a last minute ploy that is supposed to drive home that Bad does not have many chances left. This comes in the form of him loosing Jean's young son in a public place. It's done in a clumsy and not very realistic way that smacks of ""after school special"" and is totally unneeded. We got the ""he's an alcoholic"" point the first three times he threw up in a trash can or toilet. My verdict is that Jeff Bridges was incredible at what he did but the movie itself was flawed by formula plotting."

","Preface: This was a difficult film review to write as I don't know very much about love, old age, or country music. Whenever I find reviews hard to conceptualize, I write the first paragraph in my mind while on my nightly walk. ""Shutter Island"" took me two two-mile walks to complete before pressing the keys on my laptop. ""Crazy Heart"" was worth four walks for the first two paragraphs. I tried to be more conversational with this one, assuming you know something about the movie. I used to hide my creative deficiencies behind cultural critiques, and now I've incorporated them more effectively into the article.<br/><br/>Bad Blake is the reason modern country music was sanitized. He's the epitome of what a lot of over-protective people would find distasteful in their singers. He's not aspiring to be anyone's role model, though. The man's hardened belly fat hangs out of his unbuttoned shirt and alcohol is always on his breath. He lives almost exclusively in motels and chases women. The only noteworthy feature of this washed up old fart is his country music. People find something admirable in it and flock to his performances and buy his CDs.<br/><br/>Crazy Heart is the story of Bad Blake sometime late in his life. I'm told he is actually portrayed by Jeff Bridges, but I'll be damned if I didn't think Blake was playing Bridges. Whoever it is in the title role doesn't only look the part of an ole timey singer, but makes you think he really is one. Maybe Blake could have been a movie star and Bridges a country singer.<br/><br/>The Blake we see is now is happy to travel from bowling alleys to bars playing for his aging fans. He can indulge in their effervescent adoration for free booze and sex. The first part of the movie is actually little more than his mundane day-to-day life. Things pick when he meets pretty reporter Jean Craddock (Maggie Gyllenhaal) who asks him a few questions about his life and music. Blake tries to answer a few questions and before mesmerizing her and the audience with the quote ""I can't believe how bad you make this room look"". It has to be one of the best pick up lines nobody thought of and really shows off his talents as a songwriter. The line sells the film as the almost-biopic Bridges and Blake make it to be.<br/><br/>But he moves on and plays the role of special guest for a modern singer whose songs he writes. He keeps in touch with Jean and they start dating. She even visits him at his home, where he eventually proceeds to lose her child while at the mall. Their relationship comes to a sudden end and he writes a song about redemptive romance called ""Crazy Heart"".<br/><br/>Bad Blake is too settled at the point in his life that we see. I would have much preferred to see him in his glory days. A lot of Crazy Heart is well-acted nothingness interrupted by various occurrences that spring action into place. Take when Blake crashes his car and Jean meets him in the hospital. This haphazard results in their reconnection that moves the stagnant story forward. She takes him home and he bonds with her son. He loses the kid and they break up. He tries to find solace by going sober, while she finds a more reliable (not an alcoholic) boyfriend.<br/><br/>Maybe, if Blake had died, his film would have the emotive effect of The Wrestler. The latter has the same type of character in a more challenging and symbolic setting. Bad Blake is placed in a world of his own, and we are forced onto him. This is a curious case of an otherwise ineffectual movie only worth watching because of the impressive performance of its leading actor. Recommended"

","D and I saw the film this afternoon and both of us, over a meal later, had roughly the same conclusions about it: we both thought that it was a tough movie and that the characters were sharply drawn and well executed. We both thought that Bridges deserved his awards for an extremely well acted role. Our only difference was that I thought the first 2/3rds was a hard watch and she thought the last third was the harder to watch. If you see the film you will know exactly of what we speak. Having lived in the States and having traveled its roads, I found the watching uncomfortable; I've seen those bars, those towns and those bowling alleys and although filmed and portrayed well, they were too well to be comfortable. I have seen Bad in his many forms and none of them are remotely pretty. The male/female relationships in this film are too numbing to handle; it's like the song says, ""Lookin' for love in all the wrong places"". I can't really buy the press release , ""The Harder The Life, The Sweeter The Music; the old saw about making a silk purse out of a sow's ear comes to mind. However, these thoughts are about the subject of the movie not about the movie itself; we are morphing into existential thought here and those thoughts are a factor of just how good this film was in that it brings out thoughts extraneous to the actual film. That, in my opinion, is the highest compliment that can be paid a film."
"Willie-12","6","2","3","21 March 2010"," Exceptional Acting In A Pretty Decent Movie
","Sometimes an acting performance is so good, that it makes a film much better than it would have been otherwise. For me, Crazy Heart is one of those films. Jeff Bridges takes this movie, throws it on his back, and then exceptionally marches it through a story that was interesting, but not entirely memorable, and a screenplay that was passable, but certainly not remarkable. And it's not just Bridges who shines here. Maggie Gyllenhaal also turns in an impressive performance that was well deserving of it's Oscar nomination. Even Colin Farrel and Robert Duvall make the most of what they are given here. But even the great acting could not catapult Heart into the realm of movie greatness. And much of that has to do with the fact that there were some flaws that simply cannot be ignored. First, even though Bridges and Gyllenhaal did have good chemistry, something about their characters' relationship just didn't seem genuine. I think much of that had to do with the fact that it developed unrealistically quickly. There were also decisions made by some of the characters that did not seem real. For example, we are led to believe that Gylenhaal's Jean Craddock is very weary when it comes to men and relationships. We are led to believe that her son is the single most important thing in her life, and that she would protect him at all costs. And yet, for some reason, she quickly jumps into a relationship with Blake, a man who is as damaged and self destructive as one can get. Not only that, she also doesn't think twice about leaving her son in the care of Blake on two different occasions. I just didn't buy it. To me, these decisions were based more on plot development, and not on trying to portray behavior that would be exhibited by real people. And in a film where these decisions make up a very large part of what this movie is about, that's a problem. However, even with these problems, I still liked Crazy Heart. I still think it's a pretty decent movie with some exceptional acting. But I can't help to think that, perhaps, it would have been better for the audience if it was the other way around."
"Michael_Elliott","Null","2","3","21 March 2010"," Great Performances and Music
","Crazy Heart (2009) <br/><br/>*** 1/2 (out of 4) <br/><br/>Jeff Bridges picked up his Oscar for this portrayal of Bad Blake, a country-music star who is an alcoholic and finds his later days playing bowling alleys and other small venues. He meets a female reporter (Maggie Gyllenhaal) who he begins an affair with as he slowly tries to pick up the pieces. This isn't the greatest film ever made but I don't think that was the goal or intent. It's strange but it seems like this movie was put together simply to build a great role for Bridges and you know going in that this is the type of role that he could do in his sleep. Everything in the film is clearly built around it and it should come to no shock that we've seen this type of material before, most recently in the previous years THE WRESTLER. With that said, people should be coming to this film to see a great performance, which they do get. They should also be expecting to hear some great music, which they do. The music and performances are top-notch here and I was a little surprised to see my foot jamming along with the music as it played. Bridges, who does his own singing, as the perfect voice for this material and he really hits a home run in terms of his vocal performance. His singing sounds exactly like what you'd expect from this character and he is magnificent in terms of the singing. As for his performance, it's exceptional as well as he hits all the right notes with this character. The mannerisms, the worn-down body and even the way he simply walks perfectly shows off this beaten character. This is the type of role that Bridges could do without much effort but you can see all the energy and fire he's putting into it. He's surrounding by an attractive cast with Gyllenhaal turning in another fine performance as the woman Bad falls for. She gives a very sensitive performance and the screenplay does her character justice by keeping her very strong in the end. Colin Farrell doesn't come off as good simply because of a simple miscast. He's good here but you just have a very hard time believing him in the role of a country music singer. Producer Robert Duvall has a nice supporting bit as well. We've seen this type of movie before and the screenplay really doesn't throw us anything original but that's not really that big of a problem since everything is so well-made and performed. Fans of Bridges and the old-time country music should really eat this film up as its a tribute to a genre of music that isn't around much as well as a tribute to a great actor given a great character."
"samkan","9","2","3","13 March 2010"," So Well Executed
","The keys to this movie are restraint and redemption. It would have been so easy to overdo a character, a scene, a theme, etc. But Bad Blake is not too crazy or wild. Maggie, Colin and Duvalls'characters are just laid back enough to seem genuine. Consider that the fans, sidemen, etc. are given lines and time enough to be authentic (usually the moron masses are treated like props). Its not some dramatic climax or epiphany that turns Bad Blake, its just him discovering what we've been watching for an hour or so. For that reason C-H is not so much an anti-alcohol film as it is about human redemption.<br/><br/>Yes the set up is very much like TENDER MERCIES, which has Duvall struggling with recovery. C-H is about redemption. Very different themes."

","My girlfriend and I saw Crazy Heart and we really enjoyed it a lot thanks to solid performances from Jeff Bridges, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Colin Farrell. Bridges' portrayal of down and out country singer Bad Blake was so outstanding and he deserved the Oscar for Best Actor.<br/><br/>What made Crazy Heart a great movie was that Bridges did his own singing and it was not dubbed or lipsynched. The soundtrack, which included a number of songs written by T-Bone Burnett added a lot to the picture.<br/><br/>Director Scott Cooper made the right choice in casting Bridges for Bad. Cooper had the role written especially for him and it was very good for Bad. Crazy Heart was definitely one of the year's best films."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","2","3","5 March 2010"," Pleasantly minimalist and devoid of melodrama
","Without wasting a shot, the first sequence lays all the cards on the table. An over-the-hill (57 as we later discover), alcoholic country singer in a banged up pickup arrives in front of a bowling alley cum bar in a desolate town in New Mexico. This down-in-the-dumps gig is the only thing his agent can offer him, as he still entertains illusions of gravy trains from his heydays. On the phone, the agent tells him that his only chance of bringing some life back to a dead career is his talent for writing songs, but said talent seems to have drowned in a sea of booze. While he still has some loyal fans, the gig ends in a sour note as he disappears in the middle of a favourite number to throw up, and comes back just as the band is finishing the last chord. Still, the loyal fans applause, and he is not ungrateful.<br/><br/>While this movie could succumb into having Bad Blake descend into an emotional infernal of ruin or rise in a soaring uplifting redemption. Instead, it is a minimalist portray of a slice of this man's life. There is redemption, but not the sort of living-happily-ever-after crowd pleaser, thereby putting it a notch above, say, the ""The blind side"" (which is itself not such a bad movie, crowd pleaser notwithstanding). ""Crazy heart"" is the sort of movie that has no villains. If you really want one, it's the protagonist himself. Jean (Maggie Gyllenhaal), a local reporter and young mother with an adorable boy of 4, is the redeeming angel. Old friend Wayne is always there when needed, and he himself a redeemed ex-alcoholic capable of fully empathizing with our protagonist's predicament. Even someone that initially sounds like an enemy turns out to be a friend – his protégé Tommy (Colin Farrell) who seems to have usurped his place. The truth is of course that he has thrown it away himself while Tommy, always grateful to his mentor, is doing everything he can to help.<br/><br/>Rather than an emotional roller-coaster, this movie gives you a detailed, realistic depiction of the protagonist and his relationship with the other characters. First and foremost is of course Jean, and here the challenge is to make this connection between the two unlikely soul mates believable. Again minimalism works. Starting with the interview Bad gives Jean in his motel room, feelings of mutual affection flow out from the two ever so gently. Even at his not-quite-top form, Bad's natural, easy charm is very palpable. With that also is his longing, deep down, after four failed marriages, for the sort of enduring care he never had. With a failed relationship of her own (for which the movie wisely does not give any detail), Jean's gentle vulnerability translates into empathy and understanding. Gyllenhaal does a wonderful job with her character, and deserves an Oscar from her nomination, although very unlikely to get it.<br/><br/>The relationship with Tommy is similarly underplayed, coming across not so much in dialogue as in music, and country music is the best medium for projecting this natural, simple friendship. Not to be missed is the duet they perform on stage in Tommy's concert with Bad as the warm-up act. The harmonizing says more about the mutual appreciation and affection between mentor and protégé than any dialogue can. Bridge's unassuming characterization of Bad has been recognized by two heavy weight awards, Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild (and it's not unexpected that the British BAFTA has gone to countryman Colin Firth). Bridges' Bad Blake has a wide spectrum: miserable but not pathetic; confident but not arrogant. This attentive, human portrayal fully deserves an Oscar.<br/><br/>The beautiful, rugged landscape of the south western country makes a statement on its own."

","'My tombstone will have my name on it, until then I'll just have to stay 'Bad'...' That's all we're going to get out of Bad Blake (Jeff Bridges) when queried about the real name that hides beneath his macho moniker. Making his weary way from Anywhere USA to Nowhere USA, Bad is rudderless. He trades on mild successes from years ago, plying the only craft he's ever known in the ghastliest 'venues' and bowling alleys that can afford a PA system.<br/><br/>With pressure on the phone from his cranky manager to get off his proverbial and write some new songs to rival the success of his former protégé, he's stuck with creative atrophy. Bad sweats to sleep in hazy brown-towelled motel rooms, he puts away more whiskey than Shane McGowan on the 31st December 1999 and looks as good with three cigarettes in his mouth as one, all the while quite skilfully refining the art of outdoor urination. Then single-mother journalist Jean Craddock (Maggie Gyllenhaal) comes calling and he hears a new melody for the first time in years...<br/><br/>OK, when put like that, it really does sound like a far-too-familiar bag of TV-movie clichés but that fact never occurs to you over Crazy Heart's two hours. It affects, absorbs and ultimately gratifies and it owes it all to one Jeffrey Leon Bridges.<br/><br/>In virtually every scene, he completely possesses Bad right down to his vomit-stained sunglasses and thatch of oily silver hair. It would be nice to say Bridges is getting better with age if he hadn't already been completely exceptional for the best part of four decades. He portrays Bad note-perfect; cantankerous but charming enough to bed himself a middle-aged redneck divorcée every night or blag a free bottle of whiskey. Tubby and suitably seasoned, his murmured words sometimes barely crack past his lips as he spouts the kind of ludicrous phrases that only a man in cowboy boots and aviators can pull off (diverting one interview with Jean by saying, 'I wanna talk about how bad you make this room look...'). It's the 57-year-old actor's finest role since he fixed himself a White Russian and saw what 'condition his condition was in' for the Coen Brothers back in 1997. There's even a nice, knowing echo of Jeffrey Lebowski in our first shot of Bad propping up a bar, looking more Dude Rancher than 'The Dude'.<br/><br/>Sometime actor and 1st-time director Scott Cooper (whose screenplay is adapted from Thomas Cobb's original novel) knows his story has its generic qualities, and wisely steers his film in the direction of Bridges' quality every chance he can. Unfussy but assured authoring never lets the film labour too long on the conventions of the down-and-out-troubadour-trying-to-turn-it-all-around template. Although, ironically, when the film could do with a sharper focus on certain aspects (rehab from alcoholism), it's surprisingly glossed over, but again it's the performance that holds the line through these struggles. Bridges' few scenes with an utterly perfect Robert Duvall are so effortlessly well judged that it's hard to see why the director chose to miscast other equally intrinsic roles. Colin Farrell tries his very best 'squint-and-act' in his role as the young country music superstar whose career has eclipsed that of his mentor, but it just suggests that if he'd been cast in Brokeback Mountain, it might have been rubbish. Maggie Gylenhaal also tries her best (cruelly referred to as a 'sad cartoon turtle' recently on the internet, but I could never condone that), but only really comes good with her performance when it asks for something other than falling for Bad's allure.<br/><br/>But let's not focus on the support acts here. We came here for the headliner and the stage belongs to Bad. Bridges is everything in Crazy Heart and as the titular song echoes over the final moments, the only thing that's missing is an encore."

","I am not a big fan of country music, wait scratch that, I do not like country music at all. And it should attests to Jeff Bridges talent that I enjoyed Crazy Heart so much.<br/><br/>It shocked me when I first read that Jeff Bridges of The Big Lebowski, Bad Company, The Contender, The Fisher King, and countless other great films has received not a single Oscar for his efforts. That will change this year and believe me rewarding Bridges for his performance as Bad Blake in Crazy Heart is not a collective award, it is for the best performance of the year. Sure the redemptive angle of a hard-luck veteran has been played out before and often, but Bad Blake is one of those characters that when you look into the man's eyes years worth of pain, regret, and weariness phase themselves into your inner psyche. Bridges completely immerses himself into Bad.<br/><br/>Now that's not to say that Bridges is the sole interest of the film, just the biggest. Jean Craddock (Maggie Gyllenhaal) is one of the many surprises of this film. In Jean Bad sees a reflection of hurt and lost opportunity. A single mother whose chance meeting with Bad could set her up for at least a little while longer. Bad knows immediately that there is something more than an interview to be had and he knows he can't let her go out that door without knowing he will see her again.<br/><br/>Colin Farrell, another good surprise, actually pulled off a southern accent and is enjoyable as Bridge's former protégé and current country superstar. The feud between the singers never reaches that scripted back-stabbing schenanigans that is seen so often.<br/><br/>The story goes along at mostly the same pace as The Wrestler last year, but the thing is you don't care that you've seen this before. Bridges has to been seen in Crazy Heart."

","Bad Blake (Jeff Bridges) is an aging, hard-living, boozing country music singer. Once a bonafide star and an excellent song writer, he has fallen on hard times. This is mostly due to his alcoholism, as it makes him unreliable to deliver a worthy concert performance. Now booked at bowling alleys, he is one testy character, for he knows what a truly great singer he really is. Bad is particularly annoyed that another singer he befriended and introduced, Tommy Sweet (Colin Farrell), is currently doing far better than he, Bad, is. Also noteworthy among his failures are Bad's four marriages, which ended in divorces, and his many, many one-night stands. Now, however, he meets a young reporter, Joan (Maggie Gyllenhaal) when she corners him after a gig in New Mexico. She is pretty and spunky and is a single mother to a preschool boy. Although unexpected and unlikely, the older singer begins a relationship with the lovely writer. But, can it last? Also, Bad accepts an offer to open for Tommy at a concert in Phoenix, although Blake is definitely upset that his headlining days are gone. However, will it result in a career resurgence? This is an excellent film, despite some similarities to other movies. The reason is Bridges, for his performance is stellar and so is his singing. He truly ""loses"" himself in the role so that the viewer sees only Blake, not the actor giving him life. Also, the supporting cast is quite wonderful, with Gyllenhaal, Robert Duvall, Farrell (his role is small but, hey, he can sing, too!), and the rest doing great work. Then, too, the settings, costumes, story, direction, production values, and, especially, the music are topnotch. In short, you would be ""crazy"" indeed to skip this one. Its a heck-of-a-story and a heck-of-a-performance from Bridges, too."

","I am reading over and over about the great acting, but run of the mill story, but I had a different experience. The duet between the two party boys, Bad and Tommy outlines the tension in this movie. Can you be free, and unapologetic about it? Will rehab help connect you to authentic passion? THat's part of the story, but there's more.<br/><br/>The story wasn't the washed up alcoholic 'could have been' man finding love and redemption... I think it's the more nuanced story of a man who has a deep calling for emotional honesty, and can't figure out life's rules - but connects to it more honestly than most of us, thus his charisma. We want what Bad has, but judge him and take him to task for having ""too much fun"". He dutifully does rehab, but still at the end hasn't accepted his passion and joy is not conventional<br/><br/>There's a theme of father and son here... he's a failure at being a father according to the conventions of society, he abandoned his son 25 years ago, and loses the 4 year old son of his lover, thus wrecking that relationship. He was a failure at conventional life and love, but the true father - son relationship was with Tommy. There was tension there, Tommy was proud of being one of ""Bad's boys"" .... and loves Bad like a father. Bad was both proud and jealous of Tommy.... but begrudgingly acknowledge Tommy was ""real country"". Part of what Bad comes to accept was happiness at Tommy singing his songs to success, but he doesn't open to this 'father/mentor' role, he watches Tommy sing his song from the sidelines... and leaves to have the bittersweet encounter with Jean. This was his fantasy of finding intimacy and happiness conventionally. Where he should have been is on the stage singing harmony with Tommy. THat's his true relationship and his art.<br/><br/>Why does Bad try to figure out conventional life? He's not a conventional man, he's undomesticated. Tommy is the only one that knows that."

","Even if your not a big country music fan, and I know many in the movie going community aren't I'm really hit and miss with country music, anyway this picture ""Crazy Heart"" is a must see for any movie watcher. As expected since the theme relates to country music it shows plenty of sorrow, hard living, and road traveling whiskey drinking. Still it's message shows that even though one does hard living that thru love and courage a chance at redemption can be found. And most of all it's special due to the acting talent of Jeff Bridges as his motions, look and dialect of an outlaw country singer makes this film even seem more believable. And his singing during the film proves he also has special talent.<br/><br/>Jeff Bridges(in the performance of a lifetime)is Bad Blake a hard living, chain smoking, whiskey drinking past his prime country music singer who's now down in the dumps. As with age and time fame passes so many by as Bad has found out and the hard living is making Blake show his age and he's also cash strapped nearly broke. He now finds himself having to work and play in front of small crowds across the southwest and western united states. And these crowds are in the form of bowling alleys, rundown beer joints and local small town club circuits. And from joint to joint Bad Blake as expected burns and lives it up hard.<br/><br/>It's on his journey to play in Santa Fe, New Mexico he meets a small town newspaper journalists named Jean Craddock(played so sweet and innocently at the same time sexy by Maggie Gyllenhaal). Jean discovers he's a complex and hard lonely man who's been divorced four times and Bad has a grown son back in Texas that he's never seen. Only sparks and a rugged connection of love is found between Jean and Bad as when getting to know Jean, Bad is attached to her young son, something that makes him feel young again and it's fitting as this feels like this is the son that Bad never had. And the flames and sparks of passion fly between both as Blake feels like a new man making love to Jean.<br/><br/>Aside from the passion Blake still burns hard at both ends leading to an automobile accident that shakes his life up. Also as he tours he meets up with the now up and coming new generation of country music stars like Tommy Sweet(Colin Farrell)which is tough for Bad to juggle. Thru this all combined with his relationship and hard living Bad comes to realize he has to change before it's to late as he has to step aside so another younger generation can develop. A good supporting turn is also found in veteran legend Robert Duvall who stars as one of Blake's old buddies in Texas named Wayne a bartender who helps Bad in his transformation.<br/><br/>Overall great film showing the highs and lows of the life of a country music star, and it's filled with enough emotion, passion, and redemption finding to make it a watch even for those who don't like country music. As Scott Cooper really scores a hit here as both writer and director. The chemistry between Bridges and Gyllenhaal is great even though the sparks of romance doesn't last as it wasn't meant. Most enjoyable is Jeff Bridges with his hard and brash yet believable turn proving that he can take on any role. As the films message is true especially that in country music life is hard living, whiskey drinking, and full of heartbreaks, and a lot of disappointments. However those who live the hardest end up redeeming themselves."
"Turfseer","8","2","3","7 February 2010"," Bridges' Oscar worthy performance highlights engaging portrait of aging country singer's battle with the bottle
","In an Oscar worthy performance, Jeff Bridges is 'Bad Blake', a down on his luck, washed up country singer who is addicted to the demon alcohol. What I like about the screenwriter's characterization of Bad Blake, is that he's someone who still likes himself despite all the reversals he's had in his life. It's precisely this portrait of an aging former country star who 'sticks to his guns' that makes the character believable and prevents the story from descending into bathos.<br/><br/>When we first meet Bad Blake, he's just arrived in his beat up '78 Suburban for a gig at a bowling alley somewhere in a small town in the mid west. When he plays and sings before the appreciative audience, it appears that he's just going through the motions—toward the end of his set, he walks off the stage and lets the hired band play, while he hits the bottle backstage. And when he returns, he only plays for one minute and calls it a night. After returning to his motel, he continues his downward spiral by drinking himself into a stupor.<br/><br/>His next gig is in another small town at a bar. There he meets a talented piano player who asks him if he would allow an interview with his niece, Jean, a local reporter, smartly played by Maggie Guyllenhaal. Blake is guarded during his interview with Jean and won't talk about his former country music partner, Tommy Sweet, who soon appears prominently in the story. Before you know it, Blake finds himself in bed with Jean and a relationship develops. Some critics and internet posters cannot believe that a younger, good-looking woman would fall for an washed-up alcohol like Bad Blake. In the novel the movie is based on, the woman is closer to Blake in age. Yes, it might be a stretch to believe that a younger woman would fall for a character such as Bad Blake, but it's still possible—especially if the woman in question is emotionally needy and has had a pattern for falling for self-destructive types (she even admits this later when she breaks up with Blake).<br/><br/>Soon Blake hears from his tough but caring manager (very convincingly played by James Keane) that he's arranged a gig for Blake to play on the under card of Tommy Sweet's big concert which will have over 10,000 people in attendance. Sweet, a younger former protégé, has eclipsed Blake and now boasts a huge following on the country music circuit. Blake decides to swallow his pride and accepts the gig since he needs the money. When we first meet Sweet, he's greeting Blake in the parking lot before the concert. Colin Farrell does a fine job in portraying the thoughtful Sweet who wants to help Blake by offering to record some of Blake's new songs if he only gets around to composing them. At this point, Blake turns Sweet down since he indicates that his muse had dried up. Nonetheless, both Blake and Sweet put on a rousing show before enthralled fans (Bridges and Farrell, under the tutelage of a vocal coach, do a fine job in doing their own singing on the soundtrack).<br/><br/>At the midpoint one wonders where the story is going and two major events occur that keep things moving nicely forward. In both cases, Blake's alcoholism puts him in jeopardy. In the first event, Blake is almost killed when he nods off at the wheel and his Suburban rolls over into a ditch off the highway. In the second event (where the stakes are significantly raised), Blake loses Jean's four year old as he takes a few drinks at a bar at a local mall. Security guards at the mall eventually locate the boy but Jean is infuriated and breaks up with Blake on the spot.<br/><br/>It's this horrendous event that convinces Blake that he needs to get himself in rehab. Helped by his friend, a local bar owner (ably played by the always dependable Robert Duvall), Blake weans himself off the bottle. He thinks this is enough for Jean to forgive him, but she makes it clear she doesn't want to see him again.<br/><br/>Jean's rejection finally brings Blake completely down to reality. Now he really cleans himself up (physically and spiritually) and begins writing music again. He even takes time to try and contact his son who he hasn't seen in years (sadly, the son wants nothing to do with him).<br/><br/>Before you know it, Tommy Sweet has recorded one of Blake's hits and it's become a #1 smash. Sweet hands Blake a big royalty check and it appears he's now back in the money and rehabilitated himself. Blake faces one last hurdle when he runs into Jean at Sweet's concert. She's now married and forgives Blake for what happened with her son. We fade out as Blake grants Jean a new interview.<br/><br/>Jeff Bridges does an excellent job of playing the talented but troubled alcoholic. He's probably a shoo-in for this year's Oscar. In fact, all the performances in Crazy Heart are uniformly excellent and they prevent the story from becoming predictable and clichéd. Crazy Heart does suffer from slow pacing at times (some of the 'bonding' scenes between Blake and Jean's four year old go on for a little too long) but all in all, there are enough twists and turns in the plot to hold your interest to the end. Crazy Heart is one of the stronger entries in this year's crowded field of indie entries for best picture."

","I'm not a big fan of country music. In my own family I'm known as the black sheep when it comes to the worlds of music, but with the film Crazy Heart, it doesn't matter whether you're a fan of country music or not, Crazy Heart is an extremely good film.<br/><br/>Crazy Heart is the story of a washed up country singer named Bad Blake, whose best days are behind him. He used to be a top-selling country music artist, but now he has spiraled down due to his alcoholism and has been relegated to playing in small town bars and bowling alleys. But Bad Blake's time for redemption comes when he falls for a small town reporter half his age, who has a four-year-old son.<br/><br/>The film was subtly directed by first time director Scott Cooper. While it isn't the most visually intriguing film I've ever seen, it is competently directed and filled with marvelous performance. Seriously, this film is really an actor's showcase.<br/><br/>The film stars Jeff Bridges as Bad Blake, and he gives a fascinating performance filled with charisma and charm. Even though Bad Blake is a sloppy mess, Bridges is just so likable at the end of the day, you can't dislike Bad Blake. Whilst you can't necessarily say it's his career's best (because he's done so many greats) he delivers a solid award's worthy performance and will win him his first Oscar.<br/><br/>Bridge's gets support from Maggie Gyllenhaal, who portrays Bridge's love interest, the small town reporter. I will boldly say that this is her greatest performance of her entire career, it is so heartfelt, I wish it could win her an Oscar, but I don't think that will happen. Finally, rounding out the cast are two fun performances from Colin Farrell and Robert Duvall, both do a lot with their small roles. I just have one question, who knew Farrell and Bridges could sing this well?<br/><br/>Now there is a ton of music in this film and the music really mirrors the narrative perfectly, T Bone Burnett and Ryan Bingham did fantastic work, in particular ""The Weary Kind"" is a marvelous song. ""The Weary Kind"" is the song that tells what the film is all about. The film is about one old man's downward journey into his own obscurity. He's not the man he used to be, and this film is about his finding his way back through some really tough tumbles down life's expressway.<br/><br/>In the end the film has a pseudo-uplifitng ending, depending upon whether or not you want him to end up with the girl, but I personally found it a satisfying ending that actually made me happy. Bad Blake's tale is a common one for these types of older artists who have been eclipsed by the young guns, and it's all about Bad Blake finding his way back and learning how he can return to the world in which he cares for.<br/><br/>I give Crazy Heart a 9 out of 10!"

","People have been complaining about the overabundance of big budget Hollywood blockbusters that are heavy on action, and explosions and don't focus on characters or plot. Crazy Heart should quiet some of the criticisms.<br/><br/>Jeff Bridges plays Bad Blake a Country Western star on the far end of his career. He was once a star with hit songs, albums people would buy and stadiums he could fill. Now he drags himself across the southwest in a car that could breakdown at any minute, playing whatever small gigs his agent can find with pick-up bands he fears are getting paid more than he is. He drinks so much he sweats whiskey. At one of his shows, small town reporter Jean Craddock (Maggie Gylenhaal) interviews him, and over a couple glasses of whiskey he falls for her. Despite her previous bad experiences with men she takes a chance on Bad. And for a while Bad vicariously experiences the family life he missed with his wife and child.<br/><br/>The relationship with Jean, which at first seems like the classic older leading man mismatch with the younger woman that wouldn't necessarily happen in real life. But Gylenhaal plays Jean that is desperate in her own way. She may not be at the end of her road like Bad is, but she definitely feels like she's backed into a corner, and the relationship between the two feels real.<br/><br/>Crazy Heart is as gently paced as a Country Western song. Colin Farrell appears in a nicely understated role as Tommy Sweet, a former protégé of Bad's who has hit the big time and is trying to help his former mentor out. Unfortunately, Bad resents Tommy's success and the opportunities he tries to steer Bad's way. Robert Duvall plays the voice of wisdom in Bad's life as his hometown bar owner. Bridges does his own singing in Crazy Heart and really works to the advantage of the character. Bridges' untrained voice exemplifies Bad's broken voice and broken life.<br/><br/>To answer the question posed by my review's title, where do you go when you hit the end of the road? Hopefully, you find yourself again. I don't know if this role will garner Bridges an Academy Award nomination, but it's a solid performance and you should find this movie."

Jeff Bridges delivers a fantastic performance — the best of 2009 — as an all-to-real cranky old country alcoholic, with a singing performance on par with Willis Alan Ramsey or Jerry Jeff Walker, and even a touch of the well-loved Dude from ""The Big Lebowski"". Colin Farrell plays a supporting character as the country star Bad Blake could've been. Farrell too does an astonishing musical performance. The love story is a bit unbelievable, but a solid script and great acting makes your heart melt nevertheless. The acting couldn't be better, but what about the story?

","Scott Cooper directs a soothing masterpiece with the musically golden Crazy Heart. A broken shell of a man, broke, burnt out from years on the road of hard living Bad Blake (Bridges) tries to conquer the lost soul of his and climb his way back. He is rough around the edges but charismatic with the southern country charm. He meets a reporter Jean (Gyllenhaal), who he falls in love with and befriends her 4 yr old son Buddy. During a visit Blake watches Buddy for Jean and takes him out for the day as he is drinking, then loses the kid which causes a major rip in the relationship. Blake's underling who is much bigger now in stardom Tommy (Farrell) wants to repay the struggling musician, but stubborn is as stubborn does.<br/><br/>A tremendous back set of a music score where Bridges and Farrell BOTH do their own singing which is actually very, very good. The drive and vision to produce these two stars in such magic is far ever seen. Bridges is fantastic, reminiscent of his portrayal in True Grit and his genius as THE DUDE. Gyllenhaal is amazing and not in the film nearly enough, a cameo with Robert Duvall as a bartender/friend who help Bad back to health is well perceived. <br/><br/>A truly well written film. You will NOT be disappointed and will feel a sense of compassion and morality as you watch the transition of the characters. A stellar film with an 8/10 for me."

","Whether it be The Wrestler or even last year's Birdman, it seems we get a story of a middle aged man nearing the end of what was a great career in something, and is forced to try and put his life together both in and outside of his career. Crazy Heart is right up there with the aforementioned films. Focusing on Bad Blake, a country singer playing in bars and other low paying places after pissing his money away on booze and cigarettes. Played brilliantly by Jeff Bridges, who gives the character just the amount of sympathy needed without it feeling overdone. But the real noteworthy performance here is Maggie Gyllenhaal.<br/><br/>A lot of people don't like Gyllenhaal, although I'm not sure why. She may have been a little bit annoying in The Dark Knight, but look at her performances in Donnie Darko, Crazy Heart, and most recently Frank, and tell me she isn't a proved Oscar caliber actress. She is magic when on screen with Bridges. Their relationship is fast moving, and although you don't really get a sense as to why they are so attracted to each other, it really works. This is not only an alcoholic man, but also one that doesn't shy away from his fair share of one-night-stands. So why is Gyllenhaal so different? Well perhaps because she has a son, buddy, who to Blake, is the son that he never had. Rather, the son he chose not to take care of all these years.<br/><br/>Rounding out the main cast is Colin Farrell and Robert Duvall who do a great job in their very minor roles. But the core of the story is right there in Bad's relationship with Jean. She is the one person who just may change his bad ways, no pun intended. The film has a very heartwarming feeling throughout even in its darkest moments. I also give the film credit for getting a country music hater, like myself, to really enjoy the movie. It won't change the fact that I still believe all country songs sound the same, but I can appreciate a good film about music. So with Gyllenhaal's emotionally powerful performance and Bridges' equally as impressive portrayal of Bad, Crazy Heart is an acting led picture that succeeds on most of what it sets out to do.<br/><br/>+Gyllenhaal's Oscar caliber performance<br/><br/>+Bridges is always good<br/><br/>+I don't even like country but I like this film<br/><br/>+A lot of depth to these characters<br/><br/>-So why are they drawn to each other?<br/><br/>8.2/10"
"videorama-759-859391","9","1","1","11 August 2015"," A movie full of heart, and great incentive: Bridges
","Amen! This frickin' great actor finally got the gold. I remember reading back in early 1987, someone saying that Oscar Win should be just around the corner for Bridges. Years later, he was voted the Oscar nominee, best deserved of a win. And if you see this win, you'll understand why he won it. Why? Because Bridges has really scratched the inside of this character. He's being, not acting. It was very natural and believable, but more so, I emphasize natural. He's a aging country singer called Bad Blake, and boy Bridges can sing too, but in the acting department, he brings it all. He has two vices, among others, that have slowly destroyed him, and we're really in the crux of his alcoholism, snubbing the advice, of experts, telling him he's on a collision with death. He smokes hard too. Among many great performances, this movie, not the first one, where he's played an alcoholic, he really makes the role his. He falls in love with a much younger woman/single mother/journalist, (a much spunky Maggie Gylenhall, really smoking up the screen) who's made many a mistake, of meeting the wrong men, and a cute, if inspiring relationship develops. Bridges really has his moments, whether funny, human, sad or pitiful, Bridges, of course the main reason, for watching this film, which I'm bloody glad I did. I'll be honest, I don't go for many of the films, Jeff Bridges does, kind of a personal conflict, when it's an actor you love. What clings to mind, in familiarity, is that of another great actor I admire, Daniel Day Lewis's, where his select movie choices are almost all ones I hated. Bridge's character really grows on you, one of such realism, which such human flaws, too real at times. He has his rude moments, early on, for us, hysterically entertaining, and his relationship with that of Gylenhall's little boy, was also cute. His relationship, with his real son, who he abandoned when a kid, we only hear in a morbid over the phone scene, is shattering as to his son's blunt response. His new found family is his salvation and his inspiration, where sadly in the end, despite Blake's turning his life around, sobering up, I really hoped Gylenhall and him stayed together. Bridges is so so, a reason to watch this, in a film I would of never seen, outside of t.v., where I caught it one night, just to see how amazing this performance was. To those who don't think he deserved this, they really can't see what great acting's about, or in other words, the closer picture. Well, look closer. Colin Farrell as a young inspired country singer, is wasted, if almost forgettable, as hardly getting screen time, where he puts the music and voice to Bridges's hit new song, inspired by his salvation duo. Robert Duvall has a nice cute role, as a bar owner, years beyond his wiseness, and good friend of Blakes. A nice character touch."

They open up to each other and start a relationship. He tries to get his life together. He talks to star Tommy Sweet (Colin Farrell) who was once his mentors. Everybody wants him to write new songs but he hasn't written anything in three years.<br/><br/>This movie is simply living off of Jeff Bridges' natural performance. He is absolutely perfect for this role. He is touching and compelling. Gyllenhaal is good. Colin Farrell surprises with a great cameo. Their scene together is so wonderful. The story is rather thin and moves at a leisurely pace. There is a lot of country music. It's an easy comforting journey."

However, the movie is made by the acting of Jeff Bridges, the general feel of the movie and the great soundtrack.<br/><br/>Jeff Bridges' Best Actor Oscar was well deserved, and came after four previous nominations (and several performances which should have been nominated, eg The Big Lebowski, The Fisher King) without an award.<br/><br/>The supporting cast - Maggie Gyllenhaal (especially), Robert Duvall, Colin Farrell - also give good performances.<br/><br/>The movie has a beautiful mellowness and sensitivity to it.<br/><br/>I am not a fan of country music, but the soundtrack is superb. Featuring original music mostly written by T-Bone Burnett and Stephen Bruton, and being more rock than country, it helps the movie along, and is excellent in its own right. Amazingly, Jeff Bridges and Colin Farrell sang their own songs - there were no overdubs - and sounded like the real thing. Colin Farrell is particularly impressive.<br/><br/>Overall, not a perfect movie, but a great one nevertheless."

","There is no denying that Crazy Heart is an excellent movie. It's a slow- moving drama about a country singer trying to find humanity in life and receives uplifting help in an unusual way. This film is like the first cousin of 1983's Tender Mercies ironically enough also starring the excellent Robert Duvall. I really liked the music in the film. The original songs are fantastic and as I am not a big fan of country music, that is some high praise. <br/><br/>Scott Cooper's film is about a washed-up country singer named Bad Blake who is an alcoholic and a man who seen too many marriages. On his road to salvation, Blake takes the route of love. He finds an aspiring journalist named Jean and with her, he just may be able to turn his life around. <br/><br/>This is the film that finally got Jeff Bridges his Oscar win. He deserved it with this role. Of course this role may draw comparison to Duvall in Tender Mercies, but Bridges put his unique spin on the movie. He has one heck of a voice. I can also say that about Colin Farrell. He is the last actor I thought would appear in a movie about country music, but he does have the vocal talent. Maggie Gyllenhaal delivers another strong performance as Bridge's female counterpart. Finally, Duvall had an effective appearance, or I shall more accurately say cameo. <br/><br/>Overall, Crazy Heart is an excellent film. It's a film about a man trying to lead the life to redemption. It's about the choices you make, the paths you are willing to take. This is a great, subtle drama and it shows Scott Cooper may have a knack for directing. The music is heaven on the ears and the original songs are some of the best written for film in years. Jeff Bridges is the key of the success of this film. I rate this film 9/10."

"estreet-eva","Null","1","1","22 November 2011"," See if for the music and Bridges' performance
","Correctly, a lot of reviewers make the comparison of Jeff Bridges broken down country singer to Mickey Rourke's broken down titular wrestler. A comparative film of a different sort is ""Gran Torino"" where Clint Eastwood's broken down auto worker also looks for late life meaning and redemption in a world that has long left him behind. The more important comparison between the films is that they both offer a chance to see two masters of their craft getting to apply it to, in many ways unpleasant and unattractive, deeply flawed characters. In many ways Walt Kowalski's racist rants and atheism are more uncomfortable to watch than Bad Blake's losing track of his girlfriend's son while drinking in a bar although both actors get the audience to care about these characters anyway. Bridges makes more of less though in a movie turns on a seemingly unlikely romance – what is it about the overweight, alcoholic nomad that is worth bridging the 30 year age gap? Maybe it's the music. The soundtrack, the quality of the song-writing, Bridges' performance, the difficult to believe use of Irishman Colin Farrell as an American country/western star all impress. Yes, the mixed ending will not thrill American audiences but it is true to the story. In short, Bridges' performance and the songwriting make this required viewing."

","I had hesitated to watch this for fear it would basically be a remake of ""Tender Mercies,"" a great movie that I did not want to spoil the memory of. But this movie shows that there is still room for at least one more entry in the ""country singer hits bottom"" genre. <br/><br/>As well recognized, Jeff Bridges is wonderful as Bad Blake, an alcoholic country singer who is a bit of a poet, a free spirit, and a wounded soul. Bad had a successful past but his drinking is getting the best of him and he is winding up playing gigs in small bars with pick-up bands.<br/><br/>I found the relationship between him and the aspiring journalist Jean developed naturally. Blake was kind enough to grant Jean an interview and when they first met they had some chemistry. Blake is viewing her as just another interviewer until she mentions she knows about Lefty Frizzell, something that Blake did not expect of her. He perked up after that. Of course the fact that Jean is a beautiful woman caught his interest right off. In the first interview Blake asks Jean more questions than she asks him. When they get a little further along we see that Bad has a real fondness not only for Jean but for her young son as well.<br/><br/>A real plus is that we get to see Blake perform at some length. This movie will appeal a lot more to you if you enjoy the music as much as I did.<br/><br/>As Blake rides from location to location in the southwest we get to see some good scenery. This movie is exceedingly well edited and filmed; nothing flashy, just well done.<br/><br/>I had not read much about this movie beyond its being about a country singer past his prime. So I was surprised when Robert Duvall showed up as an old friend of Bad's. And more surprised when Colin Farrell showed up as Tommy, one of Bad's partners from the old days. While Bad has headed down, Tommy has headed up. Bad and Tommy have a great duet scene when they are on the same bill one night. <br/><br/>This movie touches on meaningful themes of loyalty, friendship, love, and sex. Can't ask for much more than that."

A really good drama that worked so well in todays world. Like you have some kind of road out of here and back to the cool times. Fascinating. <br/><br/>Jeff Bridges (Bad Blake) is a worthy Oscar winner. One of the few people who actually look better with a goatee than shaved. I also liked that brilliant cameo by Colin Farrell (Tommy Sweet).<br/><br/>The best part of the movie is definitely music. For the love of country music, you should see this one. The soundtracks truly caressed my ears. Believe me, they won't bite yours either."
"MJLowry23","8","1","1","12 January 2011"," Does Bridges steal the show? Well frankly yes.
","On the surface, it all looks very clichéd. Bad Blake is a drunken, dirty country musician who's drowned his undeniable talents with gallons of whisky, reduced to playing small-time bars and bowling alleys. On the road he falls in love with young journalist Jean Craddock and is forced to assess his life of hard living and get back on the wagon.<br/><br/>So far, so conventional. It's a story that's been told across a range of movies. Except those movies don't have Jeff Bridges going for them. <br/><br/>Bridges, a man so likable he could sleep with your wife and kidnap your kids on Christmas Day and you still couldn't be mad with him, delivers a truly fantastic performance. On paper, Bad Blake is a figure we've seen a million times before, but the layers Bridges brings to the part create one of the most engaging characters in recent memory. Just as we see flashes of brilliance from Bad on stage, we see glimpses of his human side also, and it would take a very cold and miserable tosser indeed to not find the scenes of him bonding with Jean's son Buddy genuinely heart-warming.<br/><br/>Does Bridges steal the show? Well frankly yes. But the supporting cast do a fine job nonetheless. Gyllenhaal is great as the single mother who has been screwed over by men time and time again. Indeed, Jean doesn't throw her arms around Bad right away, and even at the couple's happiest times Gyllenaal brings a subdued sense of unease that underlies her character and gives realism to what at first seems an implausible relationship. <br/><br/>The appearance of Robert Duvall half-way through is a welcome one, like seeing an old friend. The 79 year old is reliable as ever, and after a terrific scene with Duvall and Bridges fishing together I only wished that he could have been given more to do. <br/><br/>Maybe the biggest surprise about the film is Colin Farrell as Tommy Sweet, Bad's former protégé who has since gone on to have considerable success in his own right as a pop-country star. Farrell is the classic case of great actor who stars in bad movies. That dud sex tape is probably one of the better pieces of film he's been in. But his performance in Crazy Heart is impressive, managing to make a man painted as a villain in the film's early stages actually seem rather decent and eager to get his troubled former mentor back on track. Let's just say I didn't want to punch Farrell in the face, which is a testament to how good he is in this film.<br/><br/>Great as the performances are, the, well, heart of Crazy Heart is the music. I know as much about country music as I do about thrash jazz- fusion dubstep, but the songs in Crazy Heart are undeniably gorgeous whatever you think about their genre. It's fun to hear Bad play the songs in the live settings, seeing Bad alone with his guitar in his basement, sweet melodies pouring out of a broken man, is when the true beauty of the songs emerge. Bad memorably claims that his songs come from ""life, unfortunately"" and this is clear with every note Bridges sings.<br/><br/>While the plot is unremarkable, it's simple and direct at the same time, much like one of Bad's songs. It's hard to criticise Scott Cooper too much for unashamedly centring his film around Jeff Bridges' performance when Bridges is that damn good. And let's face it, Bridges has never been that flashy, set-chewing kind of actor - the leisurely pace set by Cooper allows Bridges to shine more brightly rather than hinder him. And that, I can abide."
"josieee182","9","1","1","4 December 2010"," A beautifully stunning,under-rated classic.
","I first saw Crazyheart with my Dad in a small cinema in London- in all honesty I wasn't expecting much. The mere thought of sitting through an hour and a bit of one drunk old man's self pitying comeback attempts (the impressions I originally had of the film) wasn't very appealing. However, popcorn in hand and expectations low, I was shocked very soon. The highest praise I have to sing for this film is it's beautiful soundtrack. As a country fan, I was expecting some pretty awful songs to come out of Crazyheart; however I was pleasantly surprised. Jeff Bridges' voice truly is made for country- in fact this main role is played by him so convincingly one could easily forget this was a fictional film. Crazyheart is extremely well written and it's storyline truly touching. 'Bad Blake' is not the most lovable of characters, but I found myself sympathising with him greatly. Crazyheart contains some stunning shots and is beautifully understated. I strongly recommend this film to anyone who appreciates a classic, as in my opinion that's what this film is. The disc will ever remain right at the top of my DVD pile, and the soundtrack in my head. Watch it."
"crossbow0106","7","1","1","25 November 2010"," Decent Film, Great Jeff Bridges
","Its not hard to understand why Jeff Bridges won awards for his role in this film. The story of a hard drinking and living country singer is ordinary in its execution, but Bridges gives the character an edgy, unflinching portrayal which resonates through the film. Maggie Gyllenhall is okay, Robert Duvall is (of course) better, but the real reason to see this film is Bridges. This is not a whole life telling story, it starts in the middle, which is just as well. Jeff Bridges is a good singer, the songs are good. It was Jeff's time to win an award and he deserved it. So, fairly ordinary story made better by Jess Bridges. Watch it for that reason alone."
"kosmasp","9","1","1","8 October 2010"," Powerhouse performance(s)
","Jeff Bridges deservedly not only got nominated but won the Academy Award for his powerhouse performance (and it was about that time he got one of those statues, considering all the roles he has played up to Crazy Heart too).<br/><br/>The movie did not move along as I expected it. Anything but, because it is very slow and does concentrate almost solely on one period of time in the life of the country singer played by Jeff. But when I adapted to the concept, the movie really got me.<br/><br/>It might move along in a slow pace and it might seem that not much is happening, but it's in the subtle hints (not only in the more than stellar performances, by everyone involved, but by the story and things going on in the background). You will not get hammered over the head with things. You can figure a few things out (if you want to) or leave them be.<br/><br/>The way they handle the movie is a stroke of genius (imo) and I really liked the movie a lot. But I can see, that some people might have expected something else or where let down by the structure of the movie."
"urbanlegend23","7","1","1","10 August 2010"," Bridges' much-hyped performance doesn't disappoint, but the film itself isn't a masterpiece.
","Crazy Heart has often been dubbed ""The Wrestler, Part 2"". This film's general premise is much the same (swap wrestling for singing country songs), and while this story works well enough, it can't help but compare to The Wrestler and feels inferior and almost a rehash of that film. The pace is slowed considerably by the extended musical performances, they frankly drag and distract from the more interesting personal struggles of the two lead characters. Bridges' much-hyped performance doesn't disappoint, he truly inhabits this character – flaws and all – and gives a gritty showing that is some of the best acting of his great career. Gyllenhaal, too, is superb, her and Bridges have a wonderful chemistry that is the film's highlight. Too bad Cooper's film stands as just good, rather than great, as he invests too much in the overlong musical sequences and not enough in exploring these two appealing characters and their believable connection."
"ciscokid1970","8","1","1","6 August 2010"," Better than I expected...washed out western singer finds purpose
","Pretty impressive movie, storyline was great and it had a meaningful plot. Story of a washed up old western signer/song writer builds himself back up. The movie is not recommended for under 18, due to sex, alcohol and language (unless you want to warn your teenager of drinking and life as a musician).<br/><br/>The story is quite simple, but I do not want to give too much away. All the actors did a great job of being natural and Jeff bridges enveloped his part as aging country western singer. I was impressed they got some serious actors for relatively small parts, Robert Duvall, Colin Farrell and Maggie Gyllenhaal. They have enough western music to please most CW fans but not too much to turn non CW fans off. But you could pretty much substitute any musician, Jazz, Blues, Rockand the story would fit.<br/><br/>Way better than I expected, I can see why it received Oscar nominations."
"talkymeat","5","4","9","3 June 2010"," Very Formulaic.
","Bad Blake is a washed up country music star and he is attempting to get his life back together while juggling his faded career with a serious drinking problem.<br/><br/>Crazy Heart is unfortunately a very boring formulaic movie that just plods along until the end finally arrives. There is very little that isn't expected and Crazy Heart follows the exact formula of about a dozen other washed up ____ movies. And if you have seen The Wrestler this is essentially a carbon copy with a lot less edge and a lot worse acting/directing.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong; I like Jeff Bridges and his performance isn't bad but an Oscar, come on. Maggie Gyllenhaal, who's also very capable, is completely wasted as Blake's very convenient love interest. I was never really clear on why she liked Blake that much and I was even less clear as to why we were supposed to care.<br/><br/>Crazy Heart is not a horrible movie all things concerned, but I have it rated so low because of how little new it has to offer. I have no reason to watch it again and it never pulled me in at all. I much prefer a movie with tons of plot holes that entertains me somewhat."

","And he played them well. Here he is too very good. So are all the actors and the director. The theme and the depth though .... This moving picture not that much of a film. It's a touching story with redemption. So is a/the theme of the son abandoned and unobtainable now vs. almost adopted one, lost, found and lost again ... Corresponding, as well, with his process with Tommy. That all was a little too much. <br/><br/>But the picture's sentiment appeals to everyone. It helped me to better control my eating tonight.

Some people applauded after it ended.<br/><br/>For others it definitely worth to watch,... if there's nothing else. There is no risk. You will not necessarily regret it."
"shattenjager777","5","3","6","17 April 2010"," A standard musician biopic that loses its way as it goes
","Musician biopics, from ""Ray"" to ""Great Balls of Fire!,"" are really all the same movie. Musician gets famous, gets hooked on drugs (or just gains in ego) and becomes a jerk, falls on professional hard times, then finds his/her way to a personal salvation and immediately achieves professional success as well. Obviously, the late-life quest for redemption story is not unique to musician biopics (examples: ""The Verdict,"" ""Fearless,"" and ""The Straight Story""). In the end, ""Crazy Heart"" has more in common with the latter class of redemption movies, most notably ""The Wrestler,"" to which it bears many similarities.<br/><br/>The story is very simple and obvious--you can tell everything that's going to happen from a look at the poster or DVD cover--but it is fairly substantial and effective. However, the characters are not even three-dimensional enough to be called stock characters--some (Jean Craddock especially) are so patently unbelievable in their lack of dimension that I can't believe someone actually wrote them. They all have one thing that they do and that's all they do, even if they appear repeatedly. As an example, think about how many times Jean grins, sighs, then says ""okay."" The dialogue is also a bit off--Blake sounds awfully educated for an old musician and Tommy Sweet sounds overly sincere, to the point that he's almost as tough to take as Jean. The biggest issue here is that the final act of the movie feels like a rushed tack-on to a completed film and does not have any depth. It's just a plot device to get to an already-conceived final scene that otherwise could not exist.<br/><br/>The acting is generally fine, but there's also little required of anyone. Obviously, Jeff Bridges won an Oscar for this, but the truth is that he had the same expression on his face from the first shot to the last and never changed in between, just like every other ""performance"" of his career. His wardrobe was excellent and really conveyed his character wonderfully--it did most of the job for him. He wasn't particularly bad, because there really wasn't much for him to do. He could have looked sadder in the third act and he could have looked more panicked just before, but neither is really enough of a complaint to matter much. No one else has enough of a character for their acting even to get mentioned, even though Colin Farrell got a star entrance for the ages.<br/><br/>One odd aspect of the film was its composition. Throughout the entire film, Blake was constantly off-center, with seemingly no reason for it. Especially for a film that is about personal salvation, you normally want to show someone's life coming into balance by balancing the screen or else show the difficulty in that by unbalancing the screen. Scott Cooper did neither. It looked a lot like ""The Wrestler,"" but did not have a reason for it the way that film did. It was distracting and poor technique.<br/><br/>However, the cinematography was quite good. The film began with low-key lighting and cool colors but changed to a much brighter lighting scheme when Tommy Sweet was around, showing us that he is the path to a brighter end for Blake. Eventually, the entire scheme warmed and brightened to show us the changes in our lead character. It wasn't terribly inventive, but it was still effective. Cooper and Barry Markowitz deserve some credit for that.<br/><br/>All I will say about the music is that I hate country music and this was no different. Farrell actually had a surprisingly good voice, but Bridges was not good (though far from the worst singer I've heard).<br/><br/>All in all, it's a pretty standard redemption movie with some major flaws. If you enjoy musician biopics, it's probably worth watching. If you enjoy country music, it's probably worth listening to. However, it's nothing special."
"namashi_1","9","3","6","13 April 2010"," Bridges at his very best...
","Based on the 1987 novel of the same name by Thomas Cobb, Scott Cooper's 'Crazy Heart' is a fantastic film, with Jeff Bridges delivering a knock-out performance from start to end. 'Crazy Heart' has it's heart at the right place, it's a take on a legend named Bad Blake.<br/><br/>'Crazy Heart' is amazing work, Cooper's direction is simply superb. T-Bone Burnett and Ryan Bingham pack in a soundtrack, that ranks amongst the finest Movie Soundtracks ever. 'The Weary Kiind' and 'Fallin and Flyin' are legendary songs, they got the Academy Award and hell ya, they deserved it! <br/><br/>Coming right away to the acting, Bridges, as mentioned, is the life 'Crazy Heart'. He's incredible in each dialog he delivers, every expression he emotes and every move he takes. I always loved him, and now I have become a devotee. He finally won the Academy-Award, which according to me, should have have won him for 'The Last Picture Show'. He's a legendary figure of Hollywood! Maggie Gyllenhaal also delivers a a very good performance. Colin Farrell, even though a cameo, he sinks his teeth into the character and brings it out like flying colors. Robert Duvall is efficient, as always.<br/><br/>'Crazy Heart' is a film that cannot be missed, highly recommended! Two Big Thumbs Up!"
"Abfabbb","3","3","7","7 June 2010"," very disappointing
","The glowing reviews, Oscar buzz and Oscar win for Jeff Bridges made me think this movie was going to be great. I was very bored and disappointed. The story could have been played out in 1 hour on television. Jeff Bridges was very convincing in his role but the story and supporting cast did not make it an Oscar worthy performance. Nothing unique, Im sure, for Jeff to play boozy in a bar with a twang accent. The music was a bright spot. I felt Colin Farrell was a total miscast. He seemed very out of place in the movie as BB's ex music partner. I don't know of any attractive, young women that would be falling in love with a washed up and alcoholic singer. Not plausible. Most young women are kind of repulsed by older men unless they are rich. Very boring story drags on predictably......the ending falls flat and I was glad it was over. The movie/story seemed like it would be more meaningful back in 1975ish---Bob Dylan and country being replaced by Springsteen and disco. In 2009, it seems dated, out of touch and not plausible. Yes, as a Hallmark or Lifetime movie for women----no as a feature film and Oscar contender. Im shocked it got such high reviews. My sister and mother saw it after me and agreed with me. Boring. They didn't even finish watching it. I did."
"MikeyB1793","6","3","7","24 January 2010"," Country Cheese
","Although this is a superb and credible performance by Jeff Bridges the rest of the cast is a bit thin. I do admit that I am not much of a Country music fan. There are a few too many performances in this movie of Jeff playing in front of his adoring fans – some of whom are adoring groupies.<br/><br/>It would have been much more credible if he would have fallen for one of those aging groupie ladies. What we get instead, is a woman who is a least half his age, swooning for him. Her performance is akin to a teenage adolescent girl making moves on a very elder high school teacher. What is it with Hollywood always believing that young girls go for old guys? The old guy, in this case, is a chain-smoking, obnoxious, whisky drinking drunkard.<br/><br/>The only reality dose in this movie is when Jeff phones his long abandoned son who abruptly dismisses him."
"ferguson-6","7","3","7","28 December 2009"," Not so Bad to the Bone
","Greetings again from the darkness. The broken down country singer finding redemption could be one of the biggest cliché's in life and the movies. Somehow first time writer/director Scott Cooper and the great Jeff Bridges make it seem authentic, raw and touching.<br/><br/>Much of their success is in the amazingly subtle performance of Jeff Bridges. Heck, I believe I have the early stages of emphysema just from watching the film! Bridges' skill has always been that he melts into his role. You don't even believe he is acting - he is just that good. Here, he descends into the role of Bad Blake. Alcoholic, chain-smoking, nearly dead to the world.<br/><br/>Supporting work from Maggie Gyllenhaal is fine, though a bit unbelievable and Robert DuVall (also listed as a producer) plays Blake's only real friend who offers him a bit of support when needed. This recalls DuVall's excellent turn many years ago in Tender Mercies.<br/><br/>What sets this one apart is the realistic and raw performance of Bridges. The man is not afraid to put it on the screen. He does a good job with the singing and is certainly believable onstage. His protégé is played by Colin Farrell and their interacting is a bit awkward, as one would expect .. Farrell's character has gone on to superstardom, while trying not to forget his mentor.<br/><br/>This one is being compared to The Wrestler, but I don't feel the need to do so. It stands on it's own and certainly Mr. Bridges should be a contender for the Oscar he has earned on more than one occasion. T Bone Burnett and the late Stephen Bruton wrote the music, including the excellent ""The Weary Kind"", which should gather some Oscar love."

I actually started watching it like 5 times and forced myself through it, just because i always finish what i start.

I thought both Jeff Bridges and Maggie Gyllenhaal were solid on their own (I wouldn't nominate either personally but I don't mind their nominations) but that relationship felt so strained to me. I didn't understand the motivation of it at all, particularly from her character.<br/><br/>One minute she seemed like this flighty reporter girl and the next she was screaming at him and talking about all the mistakes she made.It felt like her character was written kind of all over the place and then brought around in order to bring out the most dramatic moments for Bad. I don't know, it all felt off to me, on that aspect. Plus really, how many times do we need to see a mother give her child to a low-life trying to get by and have them lose the kid? The second that scene started you knew where it was going. That had me rolling my eyes a lot.<br/><br/>I think the two of them make up for a lot of the flaws in the script and I liked some of the aspects of studying him as a character, but a lot of it felt too convenient (all of these things happening in his life so quickly) and like they didn't dig deep enough into the darkness of the character or his addiction.

"Scarecrow-88","10","2","4","30 June 2010"," Crazy Heart
","With a steady diet of booze and cigarettes, aging country music singer, Bad Blake(Jeff Bridges) is so far down the dumps, a career that has seen better days, he's playing bowling alleys. A relic of another era(with music that is far more authentic than what is considered country nowadays), Bad Blake is having a hard time accepting that his protégé, Tommy(Colin Farrell), is a major star, having supposedly ""left him behind"". Broke, four failed marriages, a bad persistent cough, and the rigorous travel accompanying his alcoholism and smoking, all have left Blake in need of some serious therapy. He might just find that in a reporter for a Santa Fe newspaper, Jean(Maggie Gyllenthal), who he meets while being interviewed by her. He bonds with her son, Buddy(Jack Nation)while perhaps falling in love for the first time. But, his alcoholism results in almost losing Buddy in a mall while Bad's getting drunk in a bar, which squanders what could've been a special, quality relationship, which forces him to process his situation in life and acknowledge his failures.<br/><br/>What a gift to have Robert DuVall as a bar owner pal of Bad's who offers some moral support and friendship..I was thinking about TENDER MERCIES while watching CRAZY HEART, another simple, honest little movie about a country music singer's rise from the gallows thanks to a woman and her son. DuVall is the kind of actor that brings a smile to the face the moment he appears on screen. Bad helps his Duvall's Wayne out as his bar is suffering economically. Wayne and Bad have been life long buds so it helps that some sort of ear is there to talk to. How cool is it that Jeff Bridges sings the songs in the film himself? You know it'd be easy to label CRAZY HEART an ""Oscar bait"" picture, but it's really not a loud, bloated ""look at me"" kind of film. I think this is very similar to the aforementioned TENDER MERCIES in many ways..both Duvall's character and Bad have to hit rock bottom in order to dust off their boots and straighten out their lives for the better. What a nice little movie, heart felt performances by all involved, and the story which is a realistic look at life on the road, it's drawbacks and benefits(I mean, Bad Blake is admired by those who attend his performances). I liked how the character of Tommy Sweet always extends an olive branch to his mentor, even if the success has heaped rewards his direction, we see that he has continued to remain appreciative of the man who taught him everything he knows. Going through hangovers, vomit-fits, a car crash, love loss, and being denied the chance to meet a son who doesn't wish to speak with him(after so many years, the bitterness and repulsion of the son's voice is quite potent and understandable), plus other situations deriving from his excesses is humbling and oftentimes hard to watch, but through Bridges' performance we care about him and hope he can pull himself out of the gutter, in spite of his voluntary decisions to do so."

I was pleased to see the big fella out of 'Slingblade'(he ran a mower shop)I love his Elvisy accent! <br/><br/>There are several reasons why it is average.Why would a smart young woman take an interest in a smelly, alcoholic like that?? I doubt he would be functional... A quick detour to the Betty Ford clinic and Hey presto all sorted!! DON'T THINK SO. It could have been so much better with a more suitable actor, Bridges was just too nice to bring the best out of the premise. If you've ever known any alcoholics and any alcoholic musicians, they ain't nice, it could have been a much more memorable film if it had been more of a tangled journey and had more of a redemptive ending.

Jeff Bridges sings well enough but not sure being a pretend alcoholic makes you an actor? Even get you an Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>Same feeling about this movie as Up in the Air, no real story, no drama, no dialogue, no really entertaining moment. Tommy and Bad singing a number together reminded me of Walk the Line when Phoenix sang the number with Reese Witherspoon.<br/><br/>overall, the film has comparison with Gerard Depardieus performance in The Singer (so much better) and the 'Son problem' with Mickey Rourkes character in The Wrestler, a middle aged American celebrity who has lost his way.<br/><br/>Film is certainly for lovers of country and western music, Jeff bridges fans and those who like this American way of looking at life, thank god the rest of the world does not think and behave like this.<br/><br/>I couldn't work out the Maggie character. She was introduced to Bad Blake but what is her real motive? Was she a fan? Was she attracted to 'bad' guys? If she was a journalist, who did she work for and what story about Bad Blake was she really writing or intending to write? Where was the father of the child? Where did the boy go when he disappeared from the Bar? If it wins Oscar for best actor, it is because the American market favours characters like the one played by Jeff Bridges. why couldn't they concentrate a balance between Bad Blake and Tommy? Colin Farrell both in this movie and also in the Imaginarium of Dr Parnissus demonstrates that he has acting skills of a wide reaching kind, unlike Jeff Bridges I am sorry to say who seems somewhat stereotyped.<br/><br/>Its a sad movie because clearly Bad Blake is a failing musician who wants a better life in his later years but is it too late to find that better life and come off the drink? But not sad enough because the story is not an emotional one and I feel no sympathy for Bad Blake at any time during the movie. I do not believe Maggie (Jeanne) would be so desperate at the end to do what she did."

","By now nearly everyone has heard that ""Crazy Heart"" is fueled by the dazzlingly grizzled performance of Jeff Bridges--one that has earned him several nominations including the Oscar. I won't be surprised if he wins because his Bad Blake is not simply a distinctive interpretation of a fading legend, but Bridges also brings a battered romanticism to the role. It could have been a cliché-movie-of-the-week, but instead ""Crazy Heart"" surprised me with its humor and smart supporting performances.<br/><br/>Maybe other people knew that Colin Farrel could sing, but I didn't. Farrell's Tommy Sweet could have been superficial and smarmy, but instead he demonstrates tremendous tenderness and likability. Sweet lives up to his name and delights as an authentic bright and shiny person. Bad Blake looks especially wizened when he shares a smoke with his former protégé--an important contrast.<br/><br/>Maggie Gyllenhaal brings a smoldering innocence to her portrayal of the small town reporter, Jean. Her attraction to Bad Blake is easy to understand once we see the poet emerge from behind all that smoke and whiskey. She is the reluctant muse who leads to Bad's awakening.<br/><br/>I was happy to see Robert Duvall add his own organic charm as Bad's longtime friend, Wayne. A sober bartender, Wayne is always available when Bad most needs him and it often seems like he is summoned out of the ether like 'on-star'. Duvall's generous performance is especially notable when I recall the similar vehicle, ""Tender Mercies"".<br/><br/>This was the first weekend that ""Crazy Heart"" was screened in my area, and I remain jealous of those who got to see it weeks ago, but delighted to finally enjoy today's matinée. Apparently many fans have been paying attention because it's been a long time since I've seen the cinema so full on a Saturday afternoon.

It's not just a great acting performance, he *is* the performer on the downside of prime, singing for a pittance in bowling alley bars, shacking up with the Lulabelles who remember when he was famous, tossing down cheap scotch at every turn. This is not some tour-de-force ""look at me"" show, like Heath Ledger's masterful Joker, where you sit up and say ""Wow! That's some acting!"" This is one where you have to convince yourself that it's ""acting"" at all, it's so well done.<br/><br/>The only sad thing about this great performance is that it will overshadow that of Maggie Gyllenhaal, who seems perfectly miscast to have any interest at all in Bridges' ""Bad Blake"" character - and, needless to say, who does. She's wonderful, striking, convincing, in fact, but hidden in the mist of Bridges' great achievement. Smaller parts by Robert Duvall (who also Exec Produced) and Colin Firth keep the story alive and true as we follow ""Bad"" on his journey, stumbling down the path he has set for himself by his many bad choices, but with his undeniable talent.<br/><br/>Props to both Firth and Bridges, who sing all their own material, and to whoever decided to rescue this from the ""straight to cable"" graveyard after seeing the performances within. This is good stuff, great stuff, actually, and there's Oscar buzz about. Couldn't happen to a better bunch, and if every country/western song doesn't have a happy ending, it's nice that this one will, come ceremony time in March."

","CRAZY HEART (2009) **** Jeff Bridges, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Colin Farrell, Robert Duvall, Jack Nation, Paul Herman, Tom Bower, Beth Grant, Debrianna Mansini. Bridges gives an Oscar-worthy performance as washed-up, alcoholic C&W singer Bad Blake, whose attempt at a much-needed comeback has some pitfalls along the way to sobriety and redemption: namely a budding journalist years younger paramour (Gyllenhaal spot-on perfect as usual) whose love affair proves to be the better for the couple in the long run in spite of its rocky road. First time filmmaker Scott Cooper – who also adapted the Thomas Cobb novel – allows his star a tailor-made vehicle to really sink his teeth into such a meaty character – and Bridges rises to the occasion beautifully (and points for taking on the task of composing original songs to sing and produced by wunderkind T.Bone Burnett). A real indie gem diamond in the rough."

","In the space of a year Jeff Bridges gave 2 standout performances and in doing so, created 2 classic characters; Bad Blake in Crazy Heart and shortly thereafter, the definitive portrayal of Rooster Cogburn (surpassing that of the Duke's in my estimation) in the Coen Brothers remake of True Grit. Both were Oscar - winning acts, but he did in fact take it for Bad Blake and how well-deserved it is.<br/><br/>Bridges just totally adopts the persona of the alcoholic singer-songwriter who was once a country music star, but now is just well and truly over the hill and heading for skid row, if he isn't already there. Besides the quality acting which you always get from Bridges anyway, there's the musicianship on show. He obviously knows his way around a guitar, is clearly comfortable playing with a variety of musicians and has a voice just made for a country and western veteran, who's seen better days.<br/><br/>Bridges carries this well-directed film from writer/director Scott Cooper, but he receives some wonderful support in the process. Maggie Gyllenhaal is sensational as Blake's love interest Jean Craddock, a youngish journalist and writer, as well as single mother, with a four-year-old son, Buddy. Irishman, Colin Farrell, is also surprisingly persuasive as Tommy Sweet, a new country star and former protege of Blake's. In a lovely touch Robert Duvall turns up for just a few beautifully written scenes, as a longtime friend of Blake's through thick and thin. In casting Duvall, Cooper undoubtedly pays a very respectful homage to Tender Mercies, Duvall's 1983 film for which he also won an Oscar, playing a somewhat similar character to Blake, but one who'd already started his journey to personal redemption.<br/><br/>If you appreciate country music, you're just about guaranteed to love Crazy Heart. There is plenty of music and musicianship on show with some great songs and fine playing from a cavalcade of country and western stars, in cameo roles as backing musos. This is my favourite country music themed movie, with Bridges's amazing performance the number one reason. Some may feel that at 7/10, I may well be underscoring the film and that could well be true. But along with others, I do feel the story is pretty derivative (see comments above about Tender Mercies for example) though always engaging. It shouldn't stop interested punters from feeling for the Crazy Heart."

A story which feels like it's been told plenty of time before and sometimes slightly better than it's been told here. However, there are some elements of it that do it plenty of justice. It's a story of a man who is a has-been in the music industry. And what are all has-been artists notorious for? Drinking like a fish. And this is the real source of his has-beenness. He drowns he sorrows with booze and now lives in a delusional reality where he just wants to relive the glory days instead of moving on and making something new for himself. That is until he meets a young adoring fan who teaches him some very valuable lessons... And boy oh boy does he need to learn them. This movie's true saving grace is that he realizes happiness wont be found by reliving the glory days by making a bunch more money and records and succumbing to his disease(s) but by connecting with someone who truly cares about him. This is where the heart of the movie is and boy does it hum. And of course it breaks a time or two along the journey. The music is enjoyable and every element of it makes it a story worth telling."

","""Crazy Heart"" made me realize how full of narrative clichés the ""music"" genre is. Here we have the run-down alcoholic singer, the struggling mother, the romantic subplot, the musical performance that turns sour, the rehab sequence and so on and so forth. ""Crazy Heart"" has all of these... and yet it never falls in the caricature, it features situations we're familiar with but thanks to Scott Cooper's low-key and non-sensational directing, to the nuanced Oscar-nominated performances from Jeff Bridges and Maggie Gyllenhall, ""Crazy Heart"" goes on smoothly and fluidly like a sweet Country ballad, without any false note.<br/><br/>Low-key is the word, the film and Bridges' acting never insist on making the faded star Bad Blake an object of pathos, only his situation is, which isn't the same. This is a man entering his sixties, he's twice past his prime: country music appeals to blue-collar folks of his generation while his momentum is compromised by the rise of ""hip"" stars like Tommy Sweet (Collin Farrell) whose fans never heard of Blake. He understands he's a relic from the past and not à la Hank Williams. And so he spends his time making tours from one small town to another, in places where he can't even put the whisky on his tab, the days of glory are over and the present ones are spent in the company of bottles of whisky in shabby motels. His routine is eventually broken by phone calls from his manager, sending him to another contract in another town in the middle of nowhere.<br/><br/>Now, describing this routine isn't just to fill paragraphs, the film's plot (if we can call it so) doesn't break the routine but is diluted in, just like Blake isn't a pathetic guy but a good person and a talented artist bogged down in a pathetic routine. And the film does work like a routine, preparing us for something ""big"" that never happens, it's slow-paced but so confident over its material that it doesn't try to go for the easy way, which would be convenient since Blake is a fictional character. His first concert for instance, is a disaster, he spends most of his time taking breaks and go puke in a trash-bin -I liked the touch where his glasses fall inside and got spilled over- but we never get any aftermath of that concert: no argument with his manager, no cancelled concert, no one giving him a bad press, all we see is an old groupie sharing his bed (not exactly a bimbo, she was the nasty pageant official in ""Little Miss Sunshine""). We get it, his contracts are so punctual that the incidents have no consequences, a reason why he's probably drowning his sorrow in alcohol.<br/><br/>Maybe Blake's waiting unconsciously for the incident with the gravest consequence, maybe this is a man in need for help who doesn't want to admit it. We suspect something might happen when he meets Jean, a wannabe journalist who comes interviewing him; the interview allows us to learn a little more about the man less from the answers but the way he delivers them. Blake doesn't want to talk about his real name, neither about his son but he keeps his smile on and even asks Jean private questions. Any lesser film would have made an expositional excuse out of the interview, in fact it's a very tender scene, never pressed too hard, where we can see some mutual attraction between the two. Both have made mistakes in their lives, both wish to trust the future and both see in each other a light of hope they were desperately waiting for, the chemistry is inevitable. The romance, like pretty much the rest of the film, is made of quiet and genuinely sweet moments until the one episode that will make Blake realize his life was going downhill.<br/><br/>I'm not spoiling here since there's a good deal of incidents throughout the film, a life pattern that can't be a matter of bad luck. Is Blake suicidal? It's more complex than that, the man has troubles but his troubles inspire him. And that's something I've noticed with country music and even country-related movies, music is the storyteller, country music expresses the struggle of small-town blue-collar men, maybe like the soul music of white people, taking its roots in the old folks' repertoire. Blake's music is basically his sordid life translated into poetry, the more he suffers, the better he sings, and the opposite is true. But there's too much suffering a man can take and even if he's got a lot of fans, people who like him, and forgive him, through Jean, Blake realizes his need to be loved again and forgiven. In a poignant scene, he tries to call his lost son and makes amends but doesn't get nothing from him. Blake's friend (Robert Duvall) points out that he made the right step, and at least he can forgive himself.<br/><br/>And I'm glad the film never went to spectacular emotional stunts. Watching the deleted scenes in the DVD, I was shocked by one where Bad ended up thrown in the mud and have a breakdown, shouting his real name, this is the kind of scenes the film didn't need and I'm glad it was removed, Bridges is the kind of actor who doesn't need such artifices to win an Oscar. His well-meaning average-Joe aura is enough to make Blake the object of a fascinating character study, as a man going through a double rehabilitation, one against his addiction and another to earn self-respect, to forgive himself before those he love forgive him.<br/><br/>This is a sober but meaningful music drama and maybe the reason why country films works despite so many familiar situations Is because the contemplation of life, not rebellion, is the essence of country music, a genre about simple people with complex problems, but that know how to tell their stories with simplicity and sensibility."

He delivers a sensational emotive performance and was finally awarded a long overdue Oscar for Best Actor. The plot revolves around a former country music star, Bad Blake who has now become the proverbial down on his luck alcoholic. He is reduced to playing gigs half wasted in seedy joints across the country. Eventually he runs into a reporter, Jean Craddock in one of the towns he stops in who has an interest in his life story. That interest eventually blooms into a love interest on both ends. Eventually sobering up the singer is on the rise again and comes to a crossroads in his life. He is given an opportunity by his once protege Tommy Sweet. The plot is surreal, intense, realistic, heart wrenching, redeeming and has a cathartic ending. The film examines relationships and at what cost redemption can be achieved. It almost questions whether the cost and sacrifice is worth absolution. The love story along with the accompanying music is one for the ages. This is a true work of art. I look forward to Cooper's next effort. This film is at the very top in the drama genre."

The simple plot works though because this is a character study of the highest order. Jeff Bridges makes us feel this man is real with a performance totally deserving of the Oscar he won after 5 previous nominations. As well as the broad bravura acting on display, it's the small details that he finds that make it so wonderful to watch - dropping his cigarette in a glass he's just asked someone to hold, reaching for a door chain that isn't there, finding a business card a woman gave him after an unfulfilled evening with a woman he likes.<br/><br/>Crazy Heart is a film about loss and about new beginnings.

","This is one of those true to life gems that pops up now and then. The story starts out as a slowburning, gentle portrait of a once great musician (Jeff Bridges), who is on the low down, numbing his mental pain with alcohol. Maggie Gylenhaal plays the role of a new found love. The story is kinda sad, but it all ends in a very graceful and touching mood. Probably best suited for an arthouse audience which has got the patience to watch a man slowly fall from grace.<br/><br/>The direction by Scott Cooper deserves all the praise, because this story might be simple, it is portrayed however with such gentle attention for true to life emotions that I just feel in awe of this gem everytime I watch it.<br/><br/>Produced by the actors Jeff Bridges and Robert Duvall themselves. Singer songwriter T Bone Burnett co produced this movie as well. Anyone familiar with Burnett knows that this musician belongs to the pinnacle of american singer songwriters. As a result the movie score is way up there and I aint even a country music lover. Really impressive soundtrack! And a touching gem of a movie!<br/><br/>Dedicated to the memory of guitar player and singer Stephen Bruton, who recorded the soundtrack for ""Crazy Heart"" and who died at the home of boyhood friend T Bone Burnett."

He is addicted to alcohol and cigarettes, which affect those small concerts offered in bowling halls or bars and he is forced to discontinue its performance to be able to get out because quite often he gets sick. He holds performances in various countries and in Santa Fe knows Jean with he will start a serious relationship. His manager calls and asks him if he will sing in the opening for Tommy, an younger and more successful artist than him though it got a star thanks to him. He step on vanity and agree and such his career is relaunch. He leaves in a tournament and invites Jean to come at him but she has a son and is not very sure whether to come or not but how she accepts because she loves Bad. One day she leaves the child with him and they are going to have fun at a mall, but Bad stops at a bar because feels the need for a drink and thus manages to lose the boy so then the police find him. Jean does not forgive and leaves him.

","We meet Bad Blake (Jeff Bridges) getting out of his van after a long drive, his belt buckle and fly undone; he pulls a plastic bottle out of his car and empties the pee. It's The Dude! <br/><br/>The star of THE BIG LEBOWSKI (1998) brings his Dudeness to CRAZY HEART, the tale of a country music singer-songwriter. Unlike Jeff Lebowski, Bad Blake is slightly older, slightly more talented, and slightly more confused. He's 57, he's had the hits, he's had the fame, he's played ""sick, drunk, divorced and on the run,"" and he's on the road for what may be his last tour, considering he's playing bowling alleys and toilet pubs with pickup bands. Alcoholic, smoker, tail-chaser, burnout, he instinctively feels this is the road to nowhere, but meets a vivacious young female journalist (Maggie Gyllenhaal) who turns it into his road to redemption. (Shed tear here.) <br/><br/>CRAZY HEART is compelling for the performance of one man - Jeff Bridges. He has always been a marvel to watch, from his simplistic toyishness in TRON, to his naturalistic disarray in THE BIG LEBOWSKI to his presidential mien in THE CONTENDER; here we feel the weight of his experience and road warrior grit in a performance that leaves us amazed. There is a harsh scene where Bad tries to connect with his estranged son on the phone, which leaves us with a cold stone in our guts.<br/><br/>Maggie Gyllenhaal, as always, brings a smile that can defeat armies and crush rainbows. As Jean, music journo for a local paper, she interviews Bad and ends up victim to his musician charisma (i.e. she beds him quicksmart, like any old groupie).<br/><br/>The writers (director Scott Cooper, and Thomas Cobb) try to imbue Jean with a wifely charm and weigh down her character with import and a young kid, but Bad ultimately means nothing to her if she can't accept his foibles without pouting and imposing conditions on him. And she ultimately doesn't mean much to Bad either, for when she entrusts her son to him, he loses the boy during a pub stopover, his ""drinking"" supposedly the cause of his inattention.<br/><br/>Besides his Dude-ish interaction with his road manager (Paul Herman - ""Beansie"" from THE SOPRANOS), there is a comical and endearing relationship between curmudgeonly bar owner Wayne (Robert Duvall) and Bad, who are such comfortable old friends that when Wayne walks into Bad's house, yelling for him to get ready for a fishing trip, upon finding Bad unconscious on the bathroom floor - a serious matter for most people - Wayne chuckles to himself, ""Not again!"" and nudges Bad awake, telling him to get dressed and that he'll be waiting in the car.<br/><br/>Eventually, after one bender too many, a car accident and a doctor's life-alert warning, Bad calls Wayne and says, ""I wanna get sober,"" which is the downright most ignorant thing anybody, alcoholic or otherwise, could possibly say. Because we're all born ""sober"" - you ""get"" drunk! <br/><br/>Colin Farrell is Tommy Sweet, overdosing on Too-Cool-For-School 'tude. He's an ex-member of Bad's old band, Bad's Boys, and we don't realize why Bad hates him so much at first, because he is nothing but a sweet, courteous man who never forgets to cite Bad as his mentor and the talent that started him. We realize Bad must have been simply shallowly jealous of Tommy's success away from his skirts.<br/><br/>The musicality and synch is well done, and Bridges, Farrell and even Duvall all give voice to their own performances, carrying tunes well. Only one scene spoils the movie's musical accord. When sound checking for an arena show, Bad complains about the front-of-house sound - from the stage! Shouldn't he know better after 50 years? When soundman Bear (J. Michael Oliva) says ""The mix is good, man. You can't hear what I'm hearing out here,"" Bad replies, ""You'd be surprised."" What the hell is that supposed to mean? He has a disembodied spirit self out in the FOH sound booth? How can he POSSIBLY hear the FOH mix? Why didn't the filmmakers just have him argue with the foldback engineer? If Bear is providing a FOH mix to the performers (through their foldback monitors), then Bad can complain. But Bear just said, ""out here"" meaning there are two different mixes - the front-of-house mix and the stage mix.<br/><br/>Now I'm not in any way standing up for sound engineers: all of them ARE frustrated musicians/mongoloids, and they DO - as Bad says - ""try to screw up the opening act, makes the headliner sound that much better,"" but they don't do this actively. They're just too apathetic to be competent. Through a combination of jealousy, arrogance, laziness and hubris, they throw up a mix that they believe an act should sound like, usually not even marking the levels that they've set during soundcheck, so that during the actual set, it will sound different anyway. Jackasses! Still, that's no excuse for the senseless exchange between Bad and Bear.<br/><br/>""Pick up your crazy heart and give it one more try..."" The original songs are penned by T-Bone Burnett. Bad ends up writing and selling songs to Tommy Sweet, this title track being a big hit, creating much income in a time of sobriety.<br/><br/>What to do with the cash - except create a sappy ending? 16 months after being dumped by Gyllenhaal's smile, Bad runs into her at a gig. She's got a ring on her finger. And yet, out of niceness, kindness, senility(?), he gives her a huge check he just received - to put into the bank for her kid. Maybe he's a little more civilized than me, but isn't the financial wellbeing of her kid the responsibility of the guy who put that ring on her finger?<br/><br/>The Dude needs to get a grip on that crazy heart."

","CRAZY HEART is not a bad movie, it is just a repetitive movie - yet another story about a down and out alcoholic/druggie/choose your addiction who has a life turn around moment and climbs out of the mess of a soup he/she made of life. No need to go into details as this film not unexpectedly garnered many nods at the Oscars as have the many, many other films with the same theme in the past. Yes Jeff Bridges is credible as the filthy has been alcoholic country singer Bad Blake, and perhaps it is his ability to make us tolerate his abominable behavior and still stick by him (his modus operandi on his descent into nothingness) that makes his performance gather attention from critics. But unless you are willing to spend the first two-thirds or more of the long film watching him vomit and misbehave, long enough to see his typical AA turnaround and attempt to make up for the deeds soaked in his alcoholic past, you may tire of the theme. Maggie Gyllenhaal gives a solid performance as a woman so bruised by her men of the past that she is able to catch a glimpse into the potential of Bad Blake. Colin Farrell makes a brief but significant appearance as one of the reasons for Bad's going off track. The rest of the cast feels well in tune with the country western crowd and makes us understand the need for music heroes. But in the end it is just another hard luck story, of which there are just too many.

I think that Mr. Bridges probably has a pretty good life so he doesn't realize that the goal of Hollywood should be to ENTERTAIN not to depress. He makes hopeless movies just like Steven King writes hopeless books."

","There have been times when a great performance pushes the level of a film that is barely mediocre to ""overrated""; thankfully this is nowhere near the case here. Here is a performance that can not be praised enough, with plenty of emotional force, subtle, skillful, and at times, overwhelming in its depiction of a man whose spirit has lost its way, and who might not know what to do with a second chance.<br/><br/>Bridges has proved himself one of our best actors around, with plenty of bravado and sexiness in ""Against All Odds"", and much innocence and wonder in ""Starman"". One is bound to be entertained and not cheated in any movie he might be a part of. What he has achieved in ""Crazy Heart"" is at times indescribable because it is an accomplished performance, a rich, heartbreaking, exhilarating turn. With the camera on him at all times, there is no room for a false move, and this man delivers something to be treasured.<br/><br/>""Bad"" is a man who has lived hard and played even harder. He is suddenly facing the consequences of his actions, and when given a couple of hard wake up calls and the opportunity to find some real happiness, he is not able to make the best choices. The question here is whether he is going to be able to conquer his demons or fade away in a haze of alcoholism and despair.<br/><br/>There is some pretty good direction and acting here, and it is not all Bridges'. His entire supporting cast is strong and sensitive, especially Colin Farrell, as the young man who tries to come through for his mentor but is having a tough time getting there.<br/><br/>""Crazy Heart"" is not your typical country biopic, or a lesser attempt at building much out of nothing. It explores real emotions and human flaws. It doesn't want to teach anything, but it lets us in as observers, and we might be able to come up with our conclusions while listening to some good music and watching some great performances."

","Scott Cooper makes his directorial debut with Crazy Heart, a movie about a faded country music musician. If there was any justice in this world, Crazy Heart would be his last job involving the movie industry. <br/><br/>Not only does this movie bore the audience, but it pains the audience to the point where everybody in the audience would be willing to take part in a mass suicide. <br/><br/>When the casts consists of former stars such as Jeff Bridges and Robert Duvall along with the always inconsistent Maggie Gyllenhaal and Colin Farrell, you know the movie will be mediocre at best. <br/><br/>Where the movie really fails at besides the questionable acting would be the cliché ridden plot, which is simple at best. Characters merely show up to advance the plot and offer no depth. And what should have been the highlight of this movie, the music, is stale and poorly performed. <br/><br/>To put it lightly, I'd rather cut off my manhood and proceed to shove it down my throat until I begin choking and eventually die.

"erikgloor","5","2","5","25 November 2010"," Half a Great Movie
","Anyone here shocked that famous musicians take a drink now and again? That they often live lives of excess that lead to self-destructive habits that average people might find distasteful or even frightening? My problem with 'Crazy Heart,' Fox Searchlight's 2009 film about a fading country and western star and his romance with an average person is not that it wasn't authentic.<br/><br/>My problem was whether it was a story worth telling.<br/><br/>The arc of the film unfolds as we meet Bad Blake, an aging and alcoholic country singer in the vein, perhaps, of Don Williams, played expertly by Jeff Bridges. Blake's glory days have passed and he is reduced to playing bowling alleys, quibbling over bar bills and laying unglamorous fans. We observe him relying on the kindness of strangers and arguing with his agent over money until he is asked to give a budding young reporter an interview. The reporter, Jean Craddock, is played credibly by Maggie Gyllenhaal who at this point seems destined to play the loyal but unlucky girlfriend of the socially marginal. Their romance flares, fades, and fizzles as Blake struggles professionally and Jean tries to fit him into the life she's made with her young son.<br/><br/>We're expected to understand and care about this relationship even though we only see one character experiencing it. We learn all about Blake in the first 15 minutes of the film – down to what he does with his urine on long road-trips. But Craddock's story is told entirely in relation to Blake's. Her world, her ambitions and her history all go unexplored. That's an odd choice considering the plot credits her with changing the course of Blake's whole life. We learn that she's smart, she's got a little boy, she's got a nice body and that for some reason, she's got a soft spot for this physically unappealing singer easily twice her age. And that's – it! Her primary virtue seems to be not being one of a thousand bimbos out to attach themselves in some way to Blake's fame.<br/><br/>Big deal.<br/><br/>'Crazy Heart' wants to be an interesting story about lovers from two different worlds set to music. About characters from two distinct Americas separated by time and about all the interesting questions their union might provoke. Questions its audience can relate to, like can a woman raised on Sesame Street and Gloria Steinem find her inner Tammy Wynette and stand by her man? Should she? Can famous people ever let go of their need for blind adoration and make a real relationship work? Is Jean in a relationship with a man twice her age because she really loves him? Or is it just the fame after all? Will Blake's worn out notoriety always be a crutch he can't let go of?<br/><br/>We'll never know because this film reaches for its own crutch when it turns into a cautionary tale about alcoholism. That's right, instead of having the courage and creativity to face up to the complex questions it asks to get you into the theatre and halfway through the movie, it instead lifts you up, puts you on its knee and tells you a ghost story about mean old Mr. Jack Daniels. And there is no clue it's coming. When we meet Blake we encounter, yes, a hard-drinking musician but one whose life is controlled more by bad choices, ego-mania, and fading fortune.<br/><br/>Many important performers were and continue to be functioning addicts. Some of them, like Elvis, succumb to their addictions and many more, like Keith Richards, do not. In either case, what makes them interesting to us is their art, not their addictions. And in this case, Blake's art drives all the other provocative questions this movie could have been about. We know that. Why didn't the screenwriters for 'Crazy Heart' know that?<br/><br/>What Jean ultimately decides is the most important part of her relationship with Blake is his addiction. And again, as mentioned, authenticity is not this film's failing. In an America in which corporate values have supplanted traditional ones; where nobody is indispensable and child-worshipping soccer moms control middle-class family culture, Jean's verdict is absolutely true to life.<br/><br/>But the poster for 'Crazy Heart' is a romantic image of a handsome, thoughtful and earnest musician leaning over his guitar as a gentle breeze pushes back his hair. Makes you think this is a thoughtful movie about the truth of a man's music. Like Prince in 'Purple Rain.' If they'd wanted to make an accurate poster they should have shown Jean running Blake over with a stroller on her way out of Starbucks as he lay supine in the gutter in a pile of empty beer bottles.<br/><br/>False advertising. It's called 'Crazy HEART,' not 'Crazy Drunk.'<br/><br/>Blake's one hope for redemption, of course, involves facing his addiction like a good boy and making sure the money he earns from now on is used for anything besides his own personal enjoyment or welfare.<br/><br/>The accolades 'Crazy Heart' has garnered seem to be about what this movie almost was. What it could have been. It was almost an intergenerational love-story set to some decent country music. What it ends up being is yet another chance for the coffee-house crowd and Hollywood types to cluck their tongues and snigger as yet another worn-out symbol of American virility shatters against the prow of political correctness. The ending is there to make us feel less guilty for laughing: ""See -- it was good for the old guy!""<br/><br/>Get a life.<br/><br/>This movie review by Erik Gloor"

","When Thomas Cobb wrote this novel around 1988, he probably wasn't thinking to the future of how true it is when we hear others say how life imitates art. Well, get this! Ryan Bingham, who plays Tony (the musician Bad talks to at the bowling alley) is a real-life 30 year old rising country-rock star from Hobbs, New Mexico. Bingham co-wrote ""The Weary Kind"" with T-Bone Burnett. Bingham's recording of ""The Weary Kind"" won a Golden Globe & an Oscar for Best Original Song. The real Ryan Bingham won an Oscar while a fictional Ryan Bingham, played by George Clooney in ""Up in the Air"" 2009, who was nominated the same year, did not. That's really freaky.<br/><br/>When Bad Blake (Jeff Bridges) gets on stage, the world stands still to watch & listen as this veteran country music legend departs the wise old words of life in his songs. Actually Jeff Bridges had a long time appreciation for T-Bone Burnett, who worked on the music score on the ""The Big Lebowski 1998). Jeff only agreed to play the role if T-Bone Burnett agreed to contribute a track for him to play on screen.<br/><br/>Married 4 times with a son to boot, Bad can't remember a time when he performed without getting lit. Once on the wagon, he made this comment to Wayne after performing his first sober performance. Alcohol changes the way you saw things. A more colorful person comes out of long term contemplation of sorrow behind a bottle, sitting on a barstool, regretting everything you did & said wrong. Actually, the best line in the film was said by Bad, ""Whole worlds have been tamed by men who ate biscuits."" There's not enough dark matter in the universe to fill over all the guilt you have for messing up things.<br/><br/>Scott Cooper, who originally wrote the screenplay as well as directed & shot this film in 24 days, does a wonderful job bringing this character to life. Although there were a few goofs in the film (nothing outstanding), the film would have been much better in my opinion if they had they kept the long scene labeled Bad relapses in the film and off the editing floor. This scenes includes a hilariously tipsy woman named Donna (Annie Dorley) who happens to be drinking in a local bar. Since the entire scene was removed, it only appears under the deleted scenes area where Dorley does get mentioned. We soon find Bad and her asleep in the back seat of his truck awaking in a drunken stupor and discover his truck will not start. Bad gets out to go for help and winds up falling down on his but in the muddy ground in the middle of a rainstorm. Typically watching a squalling man lying in the mud would only make people angry, but knowing how talented this guy is, you really start feeling sorry for him.<br/><br/>Bad's relationship with Jean Craddock (Maggie Gyllenhaal) starts out quite nice, but somehow, Bad has trouble keeping women for very long. Although he's trying real hard, she wants a perfect man and can't put with his miserable self destructive qualities. I can't really say whether Bad deserved her rejection the way it turned out, but hey, that the movies. I don't have any idea why Bad didn't wind up dead in a broken down sleazy motel dead of alcohol poisoning.<br/><br/>The best thing in Bad's life happens to be an old bar owner named Wayne (Robert Duvall). Duvall's role in ""Tender Mercies"" happens to happens to parallel ""Crazy Heart"" in a lot of ways and won Duvall and Academy Award as well. Thanks to Toby Keith for allowing Bridges & Colin Farrell to perform at the Journal Pavilion in Albequerque."
"PlutoandVenus","6","2","5","7 April 2010"," For all the hoopla - not so great
","For all the hype, this should be a fantastic movie – it isn't. It's an OK movie, even a pretty good movie, but not fantastic. What makes it watchable is Jeff Bridges. Its fun to see a movie star drop his gut into a role and let the wrinkles show. Bridges lets everything hang as he plays a charming country star sliding down the ladder of success. The problem is that everything else is completely predictable. He's a great guy, drinks too much, has some bad breaks, drinks too much, still gets the girl, drinks too much, loses the girl, drinks too much, makes amends, stops drinking and becomes a success again. That's the storyline of every other movie out there. That Bridges breathes some life into it makes it worth watching.<br/><br/>Maggie Gyllenhaal doesn't have much to work with and doesn't find anything to add. She's too put together to really fall for Bad Blake – he's so obviously a loser. Her clothes are all designer chic (except for that hideous tube top – if you see the movie you'll know which one I mean) and she has a nice home and adorable kid. If she's a struggling single Mom, wow, sign me up.<br/><br/>Jack Nation as Buddy is freaking adorable as the 5 year old. Bridges and Nation together are far more interesting than Bridges and Gyllenhaal. The character roles – old time fans, bartenders, women on the make – are all well done, keeping the thing moving along since it would otherwise die due to lack of action. And it certainly sounds like Bridges and maybe Ryan Bingham as Tony are doing their own songs up on stage and that's fun too, though not great music. So go see it, be glad you're not Bad, and move on to something else."
"Argemaluco","6","2","5","12 March 2010"," Three excellent performances in a mediocre film
","I will say it from the beginning: Crazy Heart is on many aspects a copy of the brilliant film The Wrestler.Both follow a famous mature man in the decline of his career, who is defeated by life and survives thanks to the nostalgia, until a new romance renews his wishes of living and inspires him to look for redemption.I do not know if that similarity is due to the chance or the marketing, and I frankly do not care (to be fair, Crazy Heart is based on a novel written in 1987).Whatever the way it is, Crazy Heart is mediocre, but moderately entertaining, and it offers three great performances.<br/><br/>Leaving the comparisons with The Wrestler aside, the story from Crazy Heart tends to ramble and loose the focus.However, we are fortunately in company of Jeff Bridges in the leading role, and his magnificent performance keeps afloat even the most insipid scenes (How many times we must see him vomiting in order to establish the fact he is an alcoholic?).And, besides of Bridges, we have Robert Duvall and Maggie Gyllenhaal, two excellent actors who show credibility and conviction on their roles.However, Colin Farrell is absolutely out of place with his performance in this movie.<br/><br/>One of the most important fails from Crazy Heart is that I did not found the romance between Bridges' character and Gyllenhaal's very credible.I said I would not keep making comparisons, but on occasions like this one, that is unavoidable.In The Wrestler, we had two ""broken"" people, who had deep emotional scars which on some way made them similar people and also justified their mutual attraction.In Crazy Heart, we have a modest and intelligent reporter falling in love with a finished alcoholic musician.The problem is that the screenplay cannot establish the connection between both characters on a plausible way, so big part of the posterior drama simply feels as a whim from the screenplay.<br/><br/>Crazy Heart is a mediocre movie, but the performances from Bridges, Gyllenhaal and Duvall made me to be moderately interested, and I think I can give to it a slight recommendation because of that.However, I cannot deny that the movie lacks of enough deepness and substance, and that is the main thing which makes a bland experience of it."
"hte-trasme","6","2","5","6 March 2010"," You wouldn't be crazy to watch it
","""Crazy Heart"" was a very well-executed film, but at times I wasn't entirely sure what is what that I was seeing be executed well. It follows Jeff Bridges' character of the dissolute, aging country singer Bad Blake intently enough to suggest a character study, and the pacing suggests one too, but we never really penetrate too much into Bad Blake. We know he's a big drinker and a smoker who's frustrated with playing small gigs -- we're shown it over and over again. We get to know a little of his womanizing past and get to see him charm women a bit. But we never really get to the why of these things. We are led to cheer for him as he contacts his son for the first time in twenty-four years, but we never really learn why he waited so long.<br/><br/>Instead we get a picture of Bad Blake through scenes of his constant (and that is not an exaggeration) drinking, smoking, lounging half-dressed in a stupor, and occasional tempermentalness. He finds some late redemption through Maggie Gyllenhaal (whose character is also somewhat underdeveloped except as a foil for Blake), but this is not enough to prevent the film from feeling -- ironic for a musical -- a bit one-note.<br/><br/>The real show here is supposed to be Jeff Bridges' performance, of course, and it is indeed excellent, as well as mainly better than the movie around it. Bridges is very believable inhabiting the tired and apathetic but frustrated but Blake. However, perhaps it has to do with the material he is given, but once he has created his remarkable characterization he doesn't really seem to stretch it anywhere. As a consequence I came away feeling like it held one note a little too much as well.<br/><br/>""Crazy Heart"" seems to belong to one of a breed of movies which are in some sense built around the performance of one actor. That's a tough bill for any actor featured that way to fill, and Jeff Bridges gets commendations for creating a characterization memorable enough to fill it. On the whole the picture was well done, and I enjoyed it for its fine acting, black humor, and good music, but there was not always enough, drama, incident, or variety for it to be completely satisfying for me."

","Back in 1983, Robert Duvall played an alcoholic country singer whose life was changed by a loving woman in ""Tender Mercies"". He won an Oscar for Best Actor for that performance. Tess Harper who played his love interest got nominated for Best Supporting Actress. Now, 16 years later, Jeff Bridges is poised to win the same Oscar for playing a similar character in a basically similar story. And Maggie Gyllenhaal who plays the love interest also earns a Best Supporting Actress nod.<br/><br/>While watching this film, everything about it felt old and predictable. You simply know you had seen it all before. (In fact, just last year, Mickey Rourke just did the same washed-up star turn but in a more exciting arena in ""The Wrestler"". Coincidentally, Marisa Tomei who played his love interest also got nominated for Best Supporting Actress.) The long running time of two hours with repetitive sequences did not help at all. The storytelling was slow and tedious. I am not really a fan of country music, but the good catchy songs in this movie kept the movie afloat.<br/><br/>The real reason to watch ""Crazy Heart"" though is to see Jeff Bridges live his role of ""Bad"" Blake. It seemed so real. I also admire his country singing voice -- very energetic, heartfelt and on-tune, even when he was singing drunk. Jeff Bridges had been Oscar nominated four times before: ""The Last Picture Show"" (supporting, 1971), ""Thunderbolt and Lightfoot"" (supporting, 1974), ""Starman"" (1984), and ""The Contender"" (2000). While his competition this year is also tight, as Morgan Freeman (""Invictus"") and Jeremy Renner (""The Hurt Locker"") also successfully inhabited their respective roles, all signs point that the Oscar for Best Actor is Jeff Bridges' to lose.<br/><br/>The standout in the supporting cast for me is not really Maggie Gyllenhaal, who did not really do anything different or innovative. But Colin Farrell is a revelation in his portrayal of Bad Blake's protégé turned current star Tommy Sweet. His thick Irish accent all but disappeared in his effective Southern drawl. His country singing style is also very good. It is also notable that Robert Duvall also appears here as Bad Blake's loyal fan and friend."

If you love Jeff Bridges, who is in every scene, you may enjoy the film. Bridges does a good job giving the film its soul, but this is essentially the same story as ""The Wrestler"", but without the intensity (desperate, aging, substance abusing performer, with an unrealistically young love interest, and an estranged child from a previous and unseen spouse). Colin Farrell as the prodigy Country star is a real stretch and judging by his performance he doesn't believe it either.

","Somebody put in an order for a fresh batch of movie clichés, please, because ""Crazy Heart"" has used up the inventory.<br/><br/>This film must have been the personal pet project of Scott Cooper, as he served as writer, director and producer, so I can only assume that the story was too close to his heart for him to be able to see what a lame retread it was. But I can't imagine what drew good actors like Jeff Bridges and Maggie Gyllenhaal to such warmed over material.<br/><br/>Every country cliché is present and accounted for: Bridges plays a washed up music star who's lost the ability to write songs until he's inspired by his muse. There's your movie. Gyllenhaal is said muse, and there's a considerable ick factor in seeing her paired with Bridges -- not only is she about, what?, 30 years younger than him, but he looks so disgusting for so much of the film that you can't imagine any woman falling into bed with him. She's got a little boy who she allows Bridges to get close to. If you think that means that we have to endure a scene of the drunk Bridges accidentally putting the little boy in possible danger and then enduring the wrath of his mom, you'd be right. In fact, there's a good chance you're right about everything, since you can call this entire film's plot, virtually scene by scene, far in advance.<br/><br/>Bridges won an Oscar for looking like hell and doing his own singing -- he's been much better in a hundred other things.<br/><br/>Grade: C"

Jeff Bridges' ""Bad"" –""you'll read my real name in my tombstone"" – Blake is that kind of man. Alcoholic, sick to the bone, twilight country singer – back to the day when country seemed to hold a darker, rustier kind of edge to it. Doesn't say much, drinks his way to the evening – though ""days and nights look the same"" – chain smokes and plays those dead end low joints of even lower turn outs. Doesn't compose anymore, a good old best of track list seems to (barely) pay the bills. <br/><br/>In other words imagine the Wrestler with a Fender Tremolux. Same old age anxiety, same bitterness, and same barrel-bottomed dignity. If only Mr. Scott Cooper had been the kind of director Mr. Aronofsky is. Scared of the shadows, reluctant to allow unpleasantness roll the misery dice of Bridges' superb performance, Mr. Cooper chooses the conventional, trodden path. It's fine by me, the breathing space is there, the juxtaposition of dark interiors and bright, open space Midwest works right, Ms. Gylenhaal's never been better (or prettier), the slow-handed finale wrenches your insides like any good old love story should do. It's just the opportunity for a great American picture missed that aches a bit. It'll be all right. Us weary kinders will get by."

","I'm a Jeff Bridges fan; have been since I saw him in movies like THE LAST PICTURE SHOW and HALLS OF ANGER- but this overblown, meandering mess of a movie makes me wonder what it was I saw in him in the first place. But it's not Bridges; it's the ridiculous writing and the lackluster film-making that conspire to dull the sheen by dulling the senses: CRAZY HEART is professional pandering at its worst. Every cardboard character goes through his or her paces at a snail's pace- and every step of the way, we see what we've seen before, again and again. In FAT CITY, Bridges was the young up-and-comer who doesn't quite have what it takes to make a go of it in one of the toughest professions on this planet (professional boxing); in CRAZY HEART, aided and abetted by one of the lamest songs you're ever likely to hear, he's an over-the-hill down-and-outer who probably (judging by the song) never made it in the Big Time. It's a lackluster performance. Still, one can take some small consolation from the thought that Jeff Bridges the actor still has more than a few good performances left in him."

If this movie had been based on a true story of a generally recognisable C&W singer, with some generally likable C&W songs it might have grabbed more of the viewers attention span.

Bridges has always had an unpretentious amiability that registers with audiences and as Bad he brings it to another level displaying a solid country voice to go along with his scruffy persona. But Bridges heavyweight performance cannot sustain the lightweight script.<br/><br/>Director Scott Cooper shoots most of Heart in close-up and while it is effective in conveying Blakes state it becomes all too revealing in displaying the limited abilities of Maggie Gylenhaal as the love interest. Displaying the same vapid style and delivery that made Diane Keaton a star she is both miscast and unconvincing as Cooper bores in on her button blue eyes for power and introspection but instead magnifies her vacuity and how far out of her depth she is opposite Bridges. Robert Duvall and Colin Farrell also chip in with uninspired performances as Cooper does little to build on their relationship (particularly Farrell) with Blake. He's content to have them toss around cliché ridden dialog without getting too deep beneath the surface with his paint by the numbers storyline.<br/><br/>It's a shame Crazy Heart plays it safe with Blake's difficult but always likable character. It might have soared if Bad was a bit more cantankerous and surly. It would have given the film a much needed shot of adrenalin and made for a more taut and powerful drama that for the most part limps along like a dreary country tune on your car radio two hundred miles from home."

Jeff Bridges gives a strong and masterful performance as a broken down singer whose life is in shambles. He succeeds in engaging and keeping the audience's attention and brings a complex and troubled character to life. It is a performance worthy of special recognition. The rest of the cast is also excellent, especially Maggie Gyllenhaal whose presence adds immeasurably to the movie's watchability. The chemistry between Jeff and Maggie is intense and remains so throughout the movie as the audience watches their cinematic relationship evolve.

A 57-year-old scuzzy musician on the brink of bankruptcy, touring in small bowling alleys (hey! it is the Dude himself back in his favorite haunt) and bars to make ends meet, what is more pathetic, he is an inveterate alcoholic. But, he is a legend of his profession, though he has been on the downturn for too long and alcohol seriously bogs down his songwriting gift along with his health, now he basically banks on his old discography to attract his die-hard/desperate groupies and holds an invidious grudge towards his protégé Tommy Sweet (Farrell), who is the red-hot country star now, but becomes more and more independent from him.<br/><br/>CRAZY HEART is Scott Cooper's debut film which finally won Jeff Bridges an Oscar more for his overdue status (5th time is the charm) than the calibre of the performance per se. There is no denying of the country-veteran finesse on stage from the musically inclined Bridges, which rightfully should also be obliged to a killing soundtrack cooked up by Mr. Burnett and the late Stephen Bruton. Mr. Bridges certainly goes out on a limb to make Bad Blake a thorough and convincing transformation from a down-and-out performer lolling in his dim motels watching Mexican soapie to a smitten soul resuscitated by a May-December romance with a young singer- mother-cum-journalist Jean Craddock (Gyllenhaal), we see him drinking, performing, vomiting, meeting-cute, touring with Sweet, parenting, drinking, panicking, repenting, drinking, vomiting until he passes out in his bathroom, then drying-out and finally he can write some new materials, the trajectory is ever-familiar, but proffers carte blanche for Mr. Bridges to rescue his character from his self-destructive morass and render as much sympathy as possible.<br/><br/>But the plot takes some arbitrary licenses in their doomed romance, for instance, if one intends to blame Bad's alcoholism for the incident causes the riff between him and Jean, the approach should have been more specific, in lieu of simply making a toddler disappear even before Bad is visibly well-oiled, which seems to imply that Jean is over-reacting in the aftermath (because the scenario could happen to everyone other than those who are under the influence), to shift some burden from Bad's behavior to Jean, and harshly intimate that she might not be such a saintly savior as we see, albeit in our moral compass, whoever is brave enough to kiss that alcohol and smoke soused mouth, then subsequently falls in love with a character like Bad Blake, must be a self-sacrificing angel!<br/><br/>Ms. Gyllenhaal usurps an Oscar nomination too, but her character is pigeonholed into a generic love interest slot, with no further delving into her psyche except for her overbearing maternal protection towards her son, also in the love-making shots, there are tangible awkwardness between her and Bridges, perhaps, both are too self-aware of their gaping age difference, against Cooper's conspicuous endeavor to project Jean in the centre during their making out, to pinpoint that she is literally enjoying the process, which only becomes embarrassingly risible, betrays a stinking whiff of self-boasting of a unpleasant, elder man's potency. Colin Farrell, during his limited screen-time, brings a breezy personality with his undisclosed singing bent, in a surprising way, his Tommy Sweet is not a blatant ingrate as we had anticipated (mostly influenced by Blake's steely taciturnity whenever his name pops up). At bottom, CRAZY HEART is a slightly above-par independent charmer, nevertheless doesn't live up to all the accolade it has sparked."

","""Crazy Heart"", is a very well acted movie. Jeff Bridges is as captivating as ever, and it's cool to finally see him play music on screen as he describes it as a very big passion to him. In a nutshell, a down and out of luck country singer begins to reassess his life. That's pretty much the one sentence plot of the movie, and it doesn't really go into any soul searching or particularly interesting areas that keeps the movie strong throughout its 1 hour 50 minute running time. The movie becomes somewhat extremely captivating while running those music portions, but dips considerably in their absence.<br/><br/>The performances hold things together well enough. Maggie Gyllenhaal is charming on screen as always, however I am getting really tired of her playing these emotionally crippled or mentally ill characters all the time. Colin Farrell is also great, yet he appears for 10 minutes throughout the movie and I can't really say all that much about him.<br/><br/>Overall the film is about redemption, trying to build back a life on a lifetime of drinking and sorrow. I kind of wish that the story was as interesting and as well done as the characters. But sadly your not going to find that here, it's just solid performances and all around decent country music.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: Decent acting, decent strong music but a half baked story will stop ""Crazy Heart"", appealing to everyone. But to those who will enjoy that are in for a good time. 7/10."
"barry_mooney","7","1","2","11 November 2012"," Not bad, but could have been so much better.
","Crazy Heart is not a bad film at all. Jeff Bridges is excellent (as always) and the opening scene in the bowling alley is a great bit of fun for those who've seen him in The Big Lebowski. The film continues to offer much promise; the music is both authentic and enjoyable, the characters and locations both add to the genuine feel and the main character, Bad Blake (Bridges), quickly lets us know what he's all about. However, the initial momentum of the film seems to very slowly fizzle and, although it remains interesting and enjoyable, Crazy Heart just doesn't really go anywhere. <br/><br/>Now, this isn't to say that all films have to have a complex and intriguing plot, but there has to be a little something extra that helps a well-made film like this go from 'good' to 'great'. This is a terrible shame because Crazy Heart wouldn't have needed much to push it into the 'great' category. It was so nearly there. For example, in contrast to what some other reviewers have found, I just didn't feel any chemistry between the Maggie Gyllenhaal character and Bad Blake himself. Her acting is great, don't get me wrong, but I didn't buy into their feelings for one another. Just look at 'Walk the Line' (not a totally dissimilar film) for a perfect example of how it can be played with utter believability; the chemistry between Reese Witherspoon and Joaquin Phoenix is simply electric. It's similar with the relationship between 'Bad' and the Colin Farrell character; their friendship is presented to you as what could be an interesting side-plot but, as with so much of the film, it simply doesn't deliver what you might hope to expect. <br/><br/>In summary, Crazy Heart is a good film. It's quite disappointing that it could easily have been so much more with just a bit more effort on the story and/or character development."
"intern-88","Null","1","2","22 June 2012"," Crazy Heart: another Hollywood sermon
","Last Sunday, Jeff Bridges won an Oscar for his performance as Bad Blake, an ageing country-and-western star, in Crazy Heart. For me, about three- quarters into the film, which has a good soundtrack and some fine acting, I got the sinking feeling that I'd been tricked. A pretty good movie had turned into a grating sermon.<br/><br/>Most movies about musicians show them trying to deal with pressures through booze and drugs, and inevitably self-destructing. But my own experience as a touring musician for 30 years is that while I've seen a few burnouts, they're a small minority. The smart ones quit their destructive habits - or quit touring. The even smarter ones learn how to pace themselves, and still have a good time. Watching Bad Blake chain- smoke and swill whisky, though, I would have bet any money that Hollywood wasn't going to let him out of this movie alive.<br/><br/>For a while, things start looking up for Bad. He meets Jean, a rather implausibly young and attractive woman with a cute little son called Buddy. Will Bad be true to his name and blow it? Well, he almost does, when he drives his car off the road and wakes up in hospital. This is the moment of reckoning. His broken ankle will heal, the doctor says, but if he doesn't stop smoking and drinking and lose 25 pounds, he will soon die from cancer, emphysema, a stroke, or all three.<br/><br/>Bad then leaves the hospital and promptly goes back on the sauce. I watched the film in New York, and there were audible groans as he lit a cigarette. I wanted to cheer, which I guess shows me up as an irredeemable degenerate. I apologise: it was becoming clear, at this point in the movie, that Bad was an alcoholic, and I know very well that an alcoholic is not a good thing to be. I know this because I've known a few alcoholics.<br/><br/>So Bad has been warned, but will not listen. And here comes the thunderbolt. Bad is trusted to take his girlfriend's son out for the afternoon, but while he's ordering a drink, the kid wanders off.<br/><br/>Never mind that this happens not in, say, a war zone, but in a shopping mall. Never mind that the shopping mall is teeming with security guards, who find little Buddy in about five minutes (after pausing briefly to lecture Bad about his drinking). Never mind that little boys will sometimes wander off if you take your eyes off them for three seconds. Never mind that this could have happened to anyone, even if they'd stopped to buy a Bible instead of a bourbon. Jean is outraged and the relationship is over.<br/><br/>Once again, we expect Bad to crash and burn. But what actually happens is, given the politically correct climate of today's Hollywood, probably the only possible alternative: the polar opposite. Bad goes to Alcoholics Anonymous (AA).<br/><br/>I confess I have my own bias here. I'm convinced that many people are in AA for peculiar, narcissistic reasons. I've been to a few AA meetings myself, as a guest and observer, and they gave me the creeps. The people I've known who have quit drinking without AA have all seemed healthier and less neurotic, and it strikes me as sad that the only alternative to self-destruction should be a quasi-religious cult, with a Holy Book, a set of rules and its own Devil; booze continues to occupy a place of dark, exalted power in these peoples' lives.<br/><br/>I'm not the first to point out that we live in strangely puritanical times, in which everything is seen as dangerously 'addictive' and the road to Redemption lies in therapy. Nevertheless, I try to put my personal reservations about AA aside when people say it has saved their lives. It's pretty hard to argue with that. Yet Crazy Heart does seem to me to reflect a climate in which people are obsessed with risk- prevention, in which children are wrapped in cotton wool, and no middle ground is seen between destructive excess and puritanical self-denial.<br/><br/>Oddly enough, though, when Bad goes back to Jean, apologising from the bottom of his heart and promising to stay clean and sober, she rejects him. She rejects him even though he's willing to sacrifice the name he's always used and go back to the one he was christened with, which, of course, turns out to be something humble and vaguely funny: Otis.<br/><br/>This was puzzling to me. Maybe she's one of those women who, having got the kind of nice, safe, unthreatening modern man she thought she wanted, doesn't find him so sexy any more. Maybe she's still punishing Bad/Otis for the shopping mall incident. Then again, maybe the filmmakers are punishing him for disobeying doctors' orders. One thing's for sure: while Bad may be better off without his drinking problem, all the colour, humour and fun seem to go out of the movie along with it. Bad may have been bad, but Otis is kind of boring.<br/><br/>I suppose Crazy Heart is well-intentioned, and has a valid story to tell. But I wonder how many people were, like me, left pining for the kind of old Frank Sinatra movie in which an entertainer's life is one big party and people admire and envy him for it. I couldn't help trying to imagine Bad Blake as played by, say, Dean Martin or Robert Mitchum. And I couldn't help mentally writing my own alternate ending. Two of them, in fact.<br/><br/>In the first one, Bad eases up on the gas pedal, loses 10 or 15 pounds (he really didn't need to lose 25), gets a shave and a decent haircut - and gets the girl. In the second, he roars off into the night, as ornery as ever, clutching a bottle of bourbon and telling us all to go to hell."
"johnnyboyz","7","1","2","24 March 2011"," We've been here before, but I cannot find fault with the journeying back if it means experiencing something like Crazy Heart; a toe-tapping, handsomely made character drama.
","I noted that 2006 French film The Singer was a lot like Aronofsky's 2009 film The Wrestler; a man with a rich history within a particular field, now apparently relegated to clinging on to his profession as well as livelihood as everything else around him appears to just descend into chaos and strife. This, as relationships with those around him appeared to strike up just as much as physical and mental well-being appeared to deteriorate in equal measure. Crazy Heart, the really rather accomplished debut film from American Scott Cooper – a man more commonly associated with support acting, completes a retrospective triangle or trilogy of error in this regard; producing a film feeding off of The Wrestler's success which in turn owed a great debt to The Singer which in turn, Crazy Heart feels somewhat similar to. The immense positives you take out of it are that in the lead role, a certain Jeff Bridges tears through the material in a fashion that makes it watchable all the way through despite prior exposure to this sort of material, and in a similar vein, director Cooper's competence in his ability to sear through the framework and the general subject matter as if he's been directing for most of his life, made particularly impressive given his background and (lack of) previous experience within this field.<br/><br/>The film's lead, a burning out and close to all but washed up country singer I read Cooper told his lead was essentially ""the fifth Highwayman"", is a certain Otis ""Bad"" Blake; a man with former glories and a rich history of singing and song writing many of whom know of. When we first encounter him, it's in the present day and we see him driving a fair old distance so as to arrive at a local bowling alley complex to do a performing of all the old favourites to an eager crowd. His arrival sees his name in the largest font possible upon the advertising hoarding towering over the complex and car park, but the fact that ""winter leagues are forming"" gets the top billing is a sure sign of the sorts of odd-jobs he appears to be getting by on nowadays. Inside, the manager greets him eagerly and enthusiastically; a great admirer, while later on a similarly aged store clerk does the same, as does a younger member of a backing group whom was always very fond of his guitar work – the generational link here of people of most ages having heard of Blake establishing a popularity it seems he had amongst many. The alley owner offers free meals and bowling, the item of drink on the other hand is somewhat taboo; a disagreement after prior niceties a blot on the communication and settles something on the back-burner.<br/><br/>As a character, Blake appears every bit as off the cusp and spontaneous as his 'bad' tag would suggest; after previously informing the store patron he would perform what is his favourite song for him and his wife at the evening's concert, Blake stumbles off stage after gearing up the backing group and is promptly sick in a trash can outside; this, before ambling back on stage to pick up the song's proverbial pieces and play it all out. The man and his wife, for whom it was requested, do not seem necessarily offended nor bothered by something so personal and something so rare in its overall happening to be affected in this way, Blake being what he is and everything that comes with it; a later instance somewhere else in which he hops off stage to do a sudden dance with a local woman in the crowd very much embedding an impromptu persona. Unlike Xavier Giannoli's The Singer, there is no distinction between on and off stage persona as Depardieu's lead sung romantic ballads for couples over 60 but occupied grimy, smoky dressing rooms back stage; Blake is this ferocious, sweaty, scatty, wacky, grizzled man on and away from the limelight and everybody appears to love him all the more for it.<br/><br/>The crux of the film is a romantic entanglement with Maggie Gyllenhaal's Jean Craddock, a reporter local to the South West in which Blake performed his first gig of the film. Like Blake, she is sceptic of relationships and commitment but has an apparent deeply routed affection for country music; both parties have had failed marriages and watching their bond slowly unravel with all this in mind is rather affecting, Cooper's attention to characterisation frank and upfront without ever pretending to be anything of more immense depth than that of what it is. The bond additionally allows Blake to undergo a process more directly linked to that of his failure in the role of a father, when Craddock's infant son named Buddy sees Blake given the chance to bond with an infant boy in the reverse manner he did so to his distanced and outcast own.<br/><br/>The film additionally explores his newfound sense of ability to write music again, when Colin Farrell's younger and more youth orientated country singer named Tommy Sweet with whom Blake shares a shadowy past despite intensely mentoring him years ago. We go on to cover Blake's life following the introducing of Craddock to proceedings, a verbal confirmation by doctors that our lead is on a one way path to ruin due to the alcohol consumption we've come to already realise was doing him little in the way of favours and his persistent chain smoking highlighting what it is he has to battle; with Craddock and her son manifestations of what it is he has to loose after previously having very little to fight for. On top of its core studies and general characterisation, Crazy Heart impressively welds in all its other content to form an adept and consummate piece which balances grizzled, dishevelled tones with friendlier and bouncier overall feeling; the short-and-large of it resulting in a really watchable piece."
"karlaset","10","1","2","26 December 2010"," Masterful work by Jeff Bridges. Heart-breaking.
","A lot of the critical reviews of this movie concentrate on what they consider to be phony moments, such the sex scenes in the movie-which are not overly graphic, or the age difference between Bad and Jean. That its not realistic that these two people would have a relationship. Or they spend time comparing this movie to Tender Mercies, and how this movie can't even compare to it. One even said that the drinking and smoking were too much, even sickening. Those things are an important part of the character and are not at all gratuitous. This movie has affected me like none other in a long time. Not a movie to be casually watched, the masterful performance by Jeff Bridges will break your heart. The essence of a story, it is character driven. Anyone who questions that Jeff did not deserve the Oscar, I challenge them to watch the scene in which he calls his older son. Or admit they are not forever haunted by the gut-wrenching scene in which he loses the little boy. You are absolutely on a roller coaster ride until the boy comes back, and later when Bad asks for a second chance when's he out of rehab. You feel every second of what goes through Bad's mind when he later finds one of Buddy's t shirts, and debates about calling Jean. Those who say this movie is boring are comparing apples to oranges. Its not an action picture, and isn't supposed to be. It's not fast-paced-that's not what this story calls for. Some say its been told before-tons of movies re-tell a story. I loved the theme song so much I bought it-and I re-live the emotions of this movie every time I listen to it. And such is the score of this movie-its better country music than I have heard in a long time. <br/><br/>This movie will hold your emotions hostage long after its over."
"Arcturus1980","8","1","2","14 December 2010"," An Oscar worthy performance backed by good music
","This film draws comparisons with The Wrestler. I give both an 8/10. As both a fan of country music and pro wrestling, I feel Bridges takes to the music better than Rourke to the wrestling. He is completely convincing as Bad Blake. Robert Duvall is perfectly cast. I was a bit alarmed to see Colin Farrell, who did a fine job, I must admit. As did Maggie Gyllenhaal.<br/><br/>Little Buddy's disappearing act could have worked on most any sensible guardian, whatever the establishment. I'm not sold on the negligence. It was a little irritating to see Gyllenhaal's Jean giving it to Bad over this. But that's a minor complaint. Jeff Bridges hits it right out of the park. I want to see more from director/writer Scott Cooper."
"TOMASBBloodhound","7","1","2","29 July 2010"," Bridges and the music are the reasons to see it.
","Despite the Academy Award winning performance of Jeff Bridges, and some fine country music, the rest of Crazy Heart is solid, yet unspectacular. This film looks great and most of the actors hit the right notes with their characters, but something kept nagging at me the whole way through. I've seen this movie before. Maybe with some different actors and locations, but if you've seen Tender Mercies or Honeysuckle Rose, then you pretty much know what to expect. Jeff Bridges' Bad Blake character is not much different from the protagonists in those other films. Heck, Robert Duvall is even on hand both as supporting actor and producer. Is there any doubt he had Tender Mercies on the brain the whole way through? Jeff Bridges plays a man named Bad Blake. And we can see early on that any success he may have had as a country singer has not stuck. He is driving from town to town in a 1978 Chevy Suburban, not even stopping to pee until he dumps out his urine jug once he reaches his destination. In the true tradition of all washed up country singers, Bad is an alcoholic and looks like he hasn't shaved or bathed in many moons. Bridges in this film looks like a cross between Willie Nelson and Hank Williams Jr.. Maybe with a bit of Waylon Jennings thrown in. He slurs. He sleeps with geriatric groupies. He leaves the stage in the middle of songs to go out back and puke. Things turn around when a keyboard player in one of his backing bands introduces him to his niece who is a writer looking for and interview with this legendary singer. Sparks seem to instantly and inexplicably fly between these two, and the next thing we know... Bad is in love. The rest of the film deals with their relationship, Bad's attempt at sobriety, Bad's relationship with his young former protégé who is now a star, etc... Its a nice, watchable character study buoyed by great music and the scenery of New Mexico and Houston.<br/><br/>Bridges earned his trophy, but the script and casting have some issues. Maggie Gyllenhaal who was not pretty enough to be the female lead in The Dark Knight, is too pretty for this role. There is really no reason we the audience believe she could fall for this old crooner, other than the screenplay says she must. And how about her enormous house in the desert? Either she makes a fortune with her local beat, or she got one heck of a settlement from her divorce. Colin Farrell as a country singer? Well, Keith Urban is a star in real life so I guess anything is possible. Nice touch having Bad play his first gig in a bowling alley. It was even a nicer touch having the proprietor offer endless free bowling to him before the show. The Dude would definitely abide. But the Hound knows a silly self-referential moment when he sees one. 7 of 10 stars.<br/><br/>The Hound."

","""Crazy Heart"" is not to everyone's taste, the whole theme being done so often and so badly in some cases. However, Jeff Bridges is astonishing in it which was confirmed with his best actor Oscar win.<br/><br/>Bridges immerses himself in the character of Bad Blake who trashes his once successful country music career by slowly drinking and smoking himself to death. He is barely hanging on at the beginning of the movie when he pulls into the parking lot of a bowling alley, empties his urine bottle and blearily surveys the scene.<br/><br/>Bridges engages us at his unattractive best when he meets, Jean, played by Maggie Gyllenhaal a journalist who is embittered by men but in spite of herself gets drawn to the remnants of his charisma as she interviews him.<br/><br/>The story is very slender and character driven but made utterly believable by the brilliant cast.<br/><br/>I've always been a fan of Bridges, Gyllenhaal not so much. Her reliance on cute tics seem to be the same in all the movies I've seen her in. Bridges, on the other hand, brings something fresh to each role and here he doesn't disappoint as he shows us the last stages of alcoholism.<br/><br/>There were several plot flaws to my mind. No mother in her right mind would have left her 4 year old son alone with an active alcoholic, twice. But this was needed for a major plot turning point but this viewer felt it was same old same old formula driven.<br/><br/>Robert Duvall, who produced, gets his teeth into a bit of filler plot, not too successfully, and enchants himself, but not this viewer, with an a cappella version of a song that was meant to be 'deep' and relevant to the plot. A burp and forgiven by me due to the enormous talent of Bridges who kept me enthralled from beginning to end.<br/><br/>Colin Farrell excelled in a role of first fiddle dancing around second fiddle and portraying, sometimes in a totally believable self-consciousness, an unutterable kindness to his mentor, Bridges.<br/><br/>I'd see it again. 8 out of 10."

","Often times a film lifts its star to new height, but every so often the film is the thing getting lifted by the star. Jeff Bridges' Oscar-winning performance as raging alcoholic and chain- smoking 57-year-old country singer Bad Blake places the film ""Crazy Heart"" on his shoulders and creates something compelling out of another film about a music star fighting inner demons and finding some kind of inspiration to push through to the other side.<br/><br/>""Crazy Heart"" at times appears to be no more than a fictional re-imagining of the Johnny Cash biopic ""Walk the Line."" There's nothing original about a washed-up singer with a drug problem who finds a shot at redemption in the form of a beautiful woman (in this case Oscar nominee Maggie Gyllenhaal). In fact, Robert Duvall, who stars in this film, won an Oscar for basically the same performance in the film ""Tender Mercies.""<br/><br/>Yet ""Crazy Heart"" works. It's easy to follow the simple story and Bridges plays Blake with so much tireless conviction. He wears down the audience with his believability to the point that no matter how badly you might want to see his character as nothing more than one of many aging alcoholic performers in cinema history, you simply can't help but resonate with his inner torment.<br/><br/>Gyllenhaal complements Bridges earthiness with her own gravitas. Down to earth has always been her calling card, but in a basic story it is her ability to complicate the emotions in these run-of-the-mill scenes for a female lead in a music drama that elevates them beyond stereotypical.<br/><br/>The music of ""Crazy Heart"" maintains the indie sensibility, which helps keep the film from falling directly in line with its predecessors. There's not a whole lot of thematic elements at work, so the script remains dependent on the music for its soul. Just about anybody could become a country fan for two hours as they watch this film because the music comes from an organic place. The songwriting for the film is superb.<br/><br/>""Crazy Heart"" is the type of drama that makes you wonder about how lightly the term Academy Award-winning can seem at times. There's nothing wrongful about the two wins and nomination for the film, it just offers proof as to how sincerity and realism can turn even the most typical of films/stories into Oscar gold.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com"

Silly me. It is the title of this movie. The theme song of this movie is The Weary Kind and as songs go, it was okay, I guess. But it had no life to it and wasn't meant to, I suppose. The song had no hook. I like songs with hooks. This was kind of like a ballad, without it sounding too much like a ballad, weary maybe. No hooks. That killed it for me. <br/><br/>However, the other country songs in here were spot on. In fact, they were better than the songs I heard at the recent County Music Awards show on TV. Yes, they still have that. They still call them country songs, but someone needs to re-examine and re-classify them. They were not the country music songs I am used to hearing. But, the country songs in this movie were. And, in one instance a little Cajun music was thrown in. I was in heaven. <br/><br/>Jeff Bridges was in his element. Yes, the beard kept reminding me of Kris Kristofferson, but I got over it. Almost. Bridges sang his own songs and did a very good job. I have said for years that he was the most under-rated actor in Hollywood. Colin Farrell was good as Tommy Sweet (Blake's one time protégé) and he can sing too. Who knew? A bigger part should have been made for him. Maggie Gyllenhall was perfect as Blake's love interest. As for Robert Duvall, well, what can I say? He is always perfect (and to me he will forever be Gus from Lonesome Dove).<br/><br/>The story was okay. I kept hoping the writers would hurry up and get Blake into Detox or some program as I was getting tired of watching him vomit. If the title song or the theme song would have been more of a toe-tapper and had the hooks, this would have been a bigger movie and may have won Best Picture. I am sure of it. But, as Bad says his songs came from ""life, unfortunately."" And, not all songs are toe-tappers, but, many of his songs in here were.<br/><br/>Violence: No. Sex: Almost.

","Even though one could argue that the film is not without some fault, it's hard not to admire a film like Crazy Heart, a story full of heart, soul, musical and acting talent. Even when it's contrived there is something quite natural about the film. The majority of critics have said that Bridges is great but the movie is good. I personally think they are both worth their weight in gold.<br/><br/>Crazy Heart is about the road to recovery. Otis 'Bad' Blake is a Texan country star, fifty- seven, broke, drunk and sick of life and crappy little gigs. Things turn when he means a young journalist looking for an interview, and he gets into a (somewhat sudden relationship with her). But in order for her to completely accept him (posibly even as a new father for her kid) he has to clean up his act and stop the drinking and drugs, which up till now have been slowly killing him.<br/><br/>There is no denying that Jeff Bridges is at the top of his game. He isn't too bad as a musician either. This is Maggie Gyllenhall's best performance yet, and after In Bruge, it may be Colin Farrell's best as well. There is not much of a story, but Crazy Heart is one of those extremely rare cases where it doesn't matter so much. That has to count for something too. So pick up your Crazy Heart and give this film a try."

And while the crazy heart in this drama doesn't cause its owner to become an objectum sexual, it does cause him to lead an unsavory lifestyle.<br/><br/>When a down-and-out, alcoholic country singer, Bad Blake (Jeff Bridges), is interviewed by a journalist (Maggie Gyllenhaal) about his once illustrious singing career, he finds himself falling in love with her. However, when his hard-drinking lifestyle becomes hazardous to her and her young son, Bad Blake must reassess his priorities.<br/><br/>Turning in one of the best performances of his career, Jeff Bridges brings the volatile vocalist and his music to vivid vivacity.

","I personally ain't a fan of country music, but those that do like it will probably enjoy this film even more. The plot is pretty straight forward and doesn't really do anything that will grab your attention spontaneously. It's basically a story about always drunk country singer and how he deals with his downfall and has some romance in it as well. And to be honest the movie is a bit dry and boring at times, cause it doesn't have that great of a dialogue or hardly any drama with intensity. But what really made this film is Jeff Bridges's solid and captivating performance playing the musician Bad Blake, it's a shame that Maggie Gyllenhaal put on such a boring performance even if it's just her character. Also the score is pretty good if your into country and all, if you don't it still ain't that bad. It's a good movie with some great performances, but if your just not into dry and slow paced style, you probably won't enjoy this as much. <br/><br/>7.3/10"

"kennychaggerty","7","1","2","12 March 2010"," Superior because of Bridges
","Although Jeff Bridges was not my personal choice to win the Oscar this year for Best Actor, it is impossible to argue against the fact that he is absolutely terrific in Crazy Heart. Despite having more respect for the character played by Jeremy Renner in The Hurt Locker, I believe Jeff Bridges deserves an Oscar for over 30 years of superior performances. Jeff Bridges may not be as widely popular as George Clooney, Angelina Jolie, Meryl Streep, or Brad Pitt, but he is an actor who appeals to almost every generation. One of his first performances was in the Oscar nominated film, The Last Picture Show (1971), which is now known as a cult classic because of the way the movie portrayed small town life in the 1950s. Since then Bridges has played a variety of rolls from the hero in King Kong (1976) to the piano expertise in The Fabulous Baker Boys (1989) to the villain in Iron Man (2008). Despite being fantastic in almost every roll he plays, Bridges is perfect for the character Bad Blake in Crazy Heart, which is essentially the same character as the Dude from The Big Lebowski. There is no actor I can think of that plays the washed-up lazy drunk better than Bridges.<br/><br/>In Crazy Heart Bridges plays a 50 year old country singer named Bad Blake, who despite having natural musical talent spends more time drinking than playing the guitar. In his early years Blake supposedly attracted masses of fans, but as he got older he lost popularity and now plays at smaller locations such as bowling allies and bars. At one show on the road he is interviewed by a local reporter named Jean Craddock (Maggie Gyllenhaal), who he falls immediately in love with and the two begin a relationship. Although Jean as well as doctors warn Blake about his bad habits, he cannot stop drinking. The relationship between Blake and Jean is the weakest part of this film, primarily because I didn't buy that Jean would fall for such a wreck of a personality (as likable as Blake is). Although Gyllenhaal gives it her all, I think someone older and perhaps less attractive would have made the story more believable.<br/><br/>Overall, the two best parts of this film are Bridges portrayal of an alcoholic musician and the songs themselves. This film really gives viewers an idea of how both music and alcohol can deeply affect an individual in two completely different ways. So despite not buying the romance between Blake and Craddock, Crazy Heart is worth your time because of Bridges performance. This is especially true if you love country music."
"freemantle_uk","8","1","2","10 March 2010"," Jeff Bridges!
","After a long and successful career Jeff Bridges has finally won an Oscar for his performance as Bad Blake in Crazy Heart. Bad Blake is a washed up country star, performing in bars across the south-west of America: it doesn't gt much lower then performing in a bar at a bowling alley. He is an alcoholic, a chain smoker, in poor health, has a string of failed marriages and estranged from his son. But Bad has some ray of light in his world, first is he gets to perform at a concert for a successful country star, Tommy Sweet (Colin Farrell), who asks if Bad could write songs for him for his new album; second is forming a relationship with Jean Craddock (Maggie Gyllenhaal), a journalist for a small town paper. Bad and Jean's relationship quickly develops and Bad becomes a surrogate father for Jean's four year old son Buddy, wonderfully played by Jack Nation. Bad starts to write again, but his old ways make Bad his own worst enemy.<br/><br/>This film had all the trapping of being a cliché, with all the old stuff, like alcoholism and a troubled father son relationship. Some critics have compared Crazy Heart with The Wrestler, following a similar story. They are also similarities with This is Spinal Tap (if it was done as a serious film) and the Johnny Cash biopic Walk the Line. Both obviously great film. Despite this built in disadvantage Scott Cooper shows himself to be a competent writer/director. He keeps the film going at a comfortable pace, gives the audience engaging characters, and give the film a more grounded, realistic feel, compared to the usual Hollywood formula. Cooper directs some good musical set-pieces, like the concert, and shows that he can give the film some heart.<br/><br/>Even though Scott Cooper did a good job and hopefully should have a long career, Crazy Heart is an actor's film, like Closer and Frost/Nixon. This was Jeff Bridges' film, winning an Oscar for his career. He gives a excellent performance as the worn down singer who just drinks to mask the pain. Bad doesn't star out as a likable character but he grows and is shown to be a complex character. Maggie Gyllenhaal also offers a good performance in this film as a woman looking for love, thinking she found it with Bad. She deserved her Best Supporting Actress nod. Colin Farrell too is good in am almost cameo role, (did that actually come out right?) His role could have been easily made out as a typical villain, but Cooper avoided that.<br/><br/>A solid film and a strong 7.5 out of 10."

I'm not a big country fan myself but the music in the film seems to be focused on 'real country' music as opposed to mainstream country.

","Crazy Heart is a slow painfully emotional ride across an awe-inspiring country backdrop. The weathered Jeff Bridges, artfully blown by time, uncannily resembles Kris Kristofferson, which is welcomed and from what I've read, intentional. The lofty serenity of the open Southwestern country and river scene complements well with the turbulence of the character emotions.<br/><br/>Is this Jeff's best performance yet? I do not know, since this is what Jeff does best. This is Jeff's forte, Jeff's comfort zone; Jeff's just the veritable man for the part for he evokes a myriad of conflicting emotions and style, and if anything, we love him for it.<br/><br/>Surreally, The Big Lebowski cultists would have noticed the several striking similar incidents. Notably, the bowling alley, using the phrase ""jerk-off"", fishing his shades out of the puke-ridden trashcan, the bum-like alcoholism, and maybe one or two others I can't recall. Were these deliberately layered over the screenplay's graveness for some esoteric laughs? Perhaps. I chuckled.<br/><br/>Colin Farrell as an American peaking country star also spurred a chortle. Although indeed, his Crazy Heart rendition towards the film's end was good enough to overlook his actual origins. The soundtrack lifts the film from its premise of hopelessness and reveals that inspiration comes in many forms, and often passionately surfaces from depression. Interspersed with blues, the country and western will appeal to the veteran country lover and the current alternative-country music aficionado.<br/><br/>Does Jeff deserve an Oscar? Well, then he probably should have bagged one for The Big Lebowski. But that's not how the Academy works. We'll just have to wait and see. Maybe his singing will bridge the gap. Until then, the Dude abides."

","My major issue with 'Crazy Heart' it's the lack of creativity. The same overused story about 'a guy that was once a star in his job and is now in poverty'. And i consider lack of creativity a terrible crime. And the worst part of it is that you can predict what will happen next. As someone that already watched tons of films that explored the same subject used in that one, i simply became very bored and disappointed. It simply does not dare to show something new for the viewer.<br/><br/>The atmosphere and at all also didn't fit at all with the country at all. The art direction made this film way too dark. The ambient just became even more depressive than it already is. <br/><br/>The soundtrack is very weird, don't helps the fact that I'm not really a fan of that genre,but i must admit that Bridge's voice worked fine. His acting didn't do much for me, i've seen him done his acting better in other films.<br/><br/>The only thing that really did catch my attention was how the director implied well the sex scenes. A rare thing in the 'throw in the face' world we live nowadays. It leaves for your imagination, it don't needs to be vulgar. Other films should follow that example.<br/><br/>Anyways, i don't like it at all, it don't adds absolutely nothing to the table,but i wasn't so annoyed by watching it. So, a 6.5/10 is fair."

","I finally got around to watching this after I enjoyed seeing Jeff Bridges perform a lot of the sound track on Austin City Limits recently.<br/><br/>He really nails the role of an aging, beat up, past his former glory, down on his luck, country singer. At one point I said out loud, ""He really is a great actor."" <br/><br/>Unfortunately there are quite a few things that keep this movie from his level of performance.<br/><br/>I saw Maggie Gyllenhaal on Charlie Rose recently and really liked her as a person. But this was the first time I'd seen her in a movie.<br/><br/>She was either miscast, misdirected, misedited or maybe she can't act but in this movie she seemed to have two tricks in her acting repertoire...she's often either inexplicably smiling or frowning...and you're left wondering what's behind either look.<br/><br/>Most of her scenes with Bridges felt very uncomfortable...there is absolutely no chemistry between them. Their love scene ends up feeling contrived and awkward and it completely stops the movie cold.<br/><br/>On the other hand the child actor playing Gyllenhaal's son and Bridges seemed to have some chemistry...and those scenes have an engaging genuineness about them.<br/><br/>For some reason Robert Duvall, who I've really liked in a number of other movies, doesn't make his appearance until nearly the end. Then the film vainly tries to establish a long friendship between Bridges and him...with lines where they talk about each other as ""old friends"" etc. <br/><br/>Duvall also puts on an accent that makes their scenes sound like two guys meeting by chance on the street rather than lifelong friends who've spent lots of time in each other's company. Even the sets and lighting in those scenes look like they're from a different movie...like they were shot and added on by a different director and crew after the movie was already completed.<br/><br/>Still Bridges valiantly shines on.<br/><br/>The end of the movie is just plain tacky. I guess it's supposed to give a warm feeling to an otherwise sad tail of loss...but it is so contrived and it was the final stake to the heart of this movie for me.<br/><br/>Oh well...it's only entertainment. : / : )"

","After seeing this, Jeff Bridges definitely deserved the Oscar he won for this role. He was great and so was Maggie Gyllenhaal. I don't think this was the best movie because it moved slowly along and there wasn't a lot of action, but the songs and acting were great. I'm always a fan of movies that have several original songs that are good, and this movie has that. The country songs in this are quite catchy and are performed several times in the movie.<br/><br/>Bridges plays a typical alcoholic aging country star, Bad Blake. Bad is reduced to playing small bars and bowling allies. He spends the days drinking and shows up just in time to sing his set. At one of his stops, he meets Jean, a small town reporter whom wants an interview. She interviews him twice and the second time starts an affair with him. This was my only problem with the film because Maggie G. is just too young for Jeff B. for it to be believable. She's not a groupie and I didn't buy someone with a young son like her would start an affair with a traveling singer. But, after getting past that, she invites Bad over to meet her boy. Bad continues his tour but is hurt in a car wreck so calls on Jean to help him out. He spends more time with Jean and her son and the relationship grows.<br/><br/>He leaves again, but they keep in touch and she comes to visit. There is an incident involving Bad and her son that changes everything including making Bad realize he needs to clean up his act.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: Great, a must see."

","I knew Townes Van Zandt personally for a number of years. Watching this movie was eerie to me because, although almost none of it matched any actual detail of Townes' life, the themes, certain events and emotions did. It's as if they did a fictionalized biography of him. The thing is, had they actually done the ending the way Townes life did end, it would have been far more of a tear jerker. Townes married the younger woman, had two children with her and died at the age of 53 from a pulmonary embolism after a hip fracture complicated by years of alcoholism and substance abuse. I urge you to read his biography at Wikipedia. The parallels are rather amazing. A previous review stated, ""First time director Scott Cooper has said this movie tells Merle Haggard's' story and Kris Kristofferson's and Waylon Jennings'."" I completely disagree. All three of those men are far too famous to have any relation to this story. On the other hand, all three of those men, along with Johnny Cash and Willie Nelson, recorded music that Townes wrote, much as what happened to Blake in the film. Townes Van Zandt had a small but devoted cult following. He wrote truly incredible music. But alcoholism killed his career and in the end killed him. Welcome to the ending of Blake's life. Oh and by the way, one of the songs in the movie, If I Needed You, was written by Townes."
"Woodyanders","9","1","3","20 March 2010"," Jeff Bridges excels in this lovely and moving drama gem
","The always excellent and engaging Jeff Bridges deservedly won a Best Actor Oscar for his spot-on performance as Bad Blake, a burn-out and booze-sodden washed-up country singer/songwriter whose life and career has hit the skids: Blake has hardly a dime to his name, hasn't written a song in three years, and barely manages to keep himself afloat performing in bowling alleys and seedy bars. Things perk up when Bad meets and falls in love with Jean Craddock (beautifully played with winning warmth and nuance by Maggie Gyllenhaal), a sweet single mother and aspiring reporter. Can Bad overcome his alcoholism and get his life back on track before it's too late? Writer/director Scott Cooper expertly crafts an absorbing and affecting tale of regret, failure, hope, redemption, and second chances that never resorts to either cloying sentiment or overblown histrionics; instead this low-key and subtle film trusts the credible story, authentically grimy locations, gradual pace, and thoroughly believable everyday characters to basically do their jobs all by themselves sans any needless flashy razzle-dazzle. Of course, this picture wouldn't work without Bridges' first-rate acting; he brings a totally convincing lived-in quality, scruffy charm, and mesmerizing deep weariness to the role of Bad that never rings false for a minute. Moreover, Bridges even sings a few terrific country songs in a surprisingly solid and effective twangy voice. Bridges receives sturdy support from Gyllenhaal, Colin Farrell as Bad's grateful and more successful protégé Tommy Sweet, Robert Duvall as loyal friend Wayne, and Paul Herman as long-suffering agent Jack Greene. Jack Nation is simply adorable as Jean's cute four-year-old son Buddy. Kudos are also in order for Barry Markowitz's polished cinematography and the perfectly harmonic score by Stephen Bruton and T-Bone Burnett (the latter also co-wrote the superb Oscar-winning song ""The Weary Kind""). Highly recommended."

So dynamic and brazen, you feel the drain of every turn his life takes as the story unfolds. Well-deserved Oscar winner. The only thing I'd mark the movie down on is the appearance of Colin Farrell as Bad Blake's cocky protégé...maybe it's because I'm Irish but to me his performance stuck out like a sore thumb.<br/><br/>Other than that I can't recommend it enough, I really feel it should gotten more recognition than it did, I do think on the whole it, and the music, will stand the test of time though.

During one such stop over he meets Jean (Maggie Gyllenhaal, also nominated for an Oscar as best supporting actress), a pretty, young journalist who wants to interview him.<br/><br/>Jean comes across as slightly needy and lonely, the type who is drawn to the wrong kind of guys. She surrenders quickly to Bad's charisma and they end up falling heavily for each other. Their chemistry is extremely believable and almost palpable at times. I very much enjoyed their on-screen time together.<br/><br/>But Jean is also the mother of a four year old boy and problems arise as Bad's alcoholism severely gets in the way of the development of a healthy relationship between them. She is infatuated by him and admires him, trying to see past his weaknesses and addiction, but must protect what she loves most, her son. Bad wants to turn his life around, unmasking his softer side as he desperately searches for some joy and comfort, but as one line in the film goes, ""it's too little, too late"". <br/><br/>Colin Farrell does a surprising and commendable representation of Tommy, a famous and thriving country singer who learned what he knows from Bad and tries to help him in his career. They both sing quite remarkably and most of all make it look very, very natural. I'm not a lover of country music but I found the tracks enjoyable, particularly ""The Weary Kind"" which won an Oscar for best original song.<br/><br/>Jeff Bridges sings and performs with ease and seems to have been made for this role. His Oscar is very well deserved and the movie satisfying without being a masterpiece.

","No special effects, no car chases, no gratuitous sex. What you have here is a great movie that didn't need any of those things to make it great. What it does have is a great story, great theme, fantastic music, beautiful location cinematography and excellent acting from incredible actors. Based on a story (of the same name) by Thomas Cobb, it tells the story of a has-been country singer, Bad Blake (Jeff Bridges), how he faces the mistakes and mess he's made of his life, and how he turns it around. Jeff Bridges, who has always been a fine actor, gives his finest performance ever and deserves to win the Oscar for which he's been nominated. Maggie Gyllenhaal is excellent as the love interest who cannot bring herself to jeopardize the life she has with her son by believing in Bad Blake's reformation. Robert Duvall, though in a small part, is of course as good as ever. The only casting choice that bothered me is Colin Farrell as the ""rival"" country singer. Colin Farrell? As an American traditional country singer? OK, whatever. Actually, I thought he gave a good performance in an admittedly small role... but he still seems like an odd choice for the part. Both Farrell and Bridges had an ""accent coach"", and both did a good job with their southern accents. I was pleased to find that Jeff Bridges actually did his own singing, and he was quite good. I intend to get the soundtrack for my iPod. The songs were traditional country-type songs, a nice change from the path country music has gone down in the past 10 years. It was filmed mostly in New Mexico (which of course, being from New Mexico, I enjoyed immensely.) One of the concerts was supposed to be at a Pavilion in Phoenix... ha! Phoenix never looked so good. It was here in Albuquerque and the frequent shots of our Sandia Mountains were fantastic. (I have to say though that it was totally unrealistic to think that a reporter in Santa Fe could have afforded the beautiful home that Gyllenhaal's character lived in... Santa Fe's inflated cost of living due to the influx of Hollywood's stars makes it impossible for middle class people to live in homes that beautiful. But who would know that if you don't live here?) The scenes in Blake's home in Houston were excellent, getting to the meat of the theme of the movie, and Jeff Bridges totally nailed the part here. I thought they could have delved more into the rehab scenes; it was just not enough to make you believe how hard rehab must be... but the scenes leading up to rehab were perfect. All in all, this is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, because it tells a good story, and isn't that what movies are supposed to be? Good stories, interesting, well-acted characters, great scenery and a perfect soundtrack; it doesn't get any better than that."

","Bad Blake is your typical legendary has-been. Proudly self-deluded, he is blind to the fact that all of his miseries are self-inflicted. He carries a reality-distortion field around wherever he travels, persuading everyone he meets to join in his conceit, turning a blind eye to his obvious alcoholism, narcissism, and downward spiraling existence. They are all recruited into his army of facilitators and enablers. He continually rejects the love and helpful hand of a young successful protégé, and allows his drinking to destroy the one relationship in his life that means the most to him. A potentially fatal truck accident, accompanied by the frank admonishment of the attending physician, he ignores completely. It takes a monstrous near tragedy involving his fiancée's 4-year-old son to finally wake him up and get him sober, but it's too late for his hopes of happiness and family. Pipe dreams of connecting with his neglected son of over 20 years evaporate as he realizes how deluded he has been throughout his prodigal life. But he stays sober, finding solace and success in turning to his music and friends who still love him and will stand by him to the end. Jeff Bridges in his finest hour, in a film that offers hope to the hopeless, sight to the blind, and real meaning within the context of life's triumphs and tragedies."

","So here we have Bridges doing what he does so brilliantly in every film he's ever appeared in - effortlessly sucking us in to his story, making us care, through the sheer easy confidence of his presence.<br/><br/>It's this deceptive (and rare) quality which has caused him to be excruciatingly under-appreciated for years, and as a longtime fan, I'm thrilled that he's finally being given some props, in the form of the great reviews for his performance and of course all the Best Actor awards he's gotten thus far, which I hope will culminate in his winning the Oscar on March 7th. As others have said, it would also be a lifetime recognition award, and there's nobody working in films today who is more worthy.<br/><br/>It's hard to separate the film from Bridges' performance, since in this case his performance IS the film. T-Bone Burnett's music is excellent, Maggie Gyllenhaal is wonderful as always, the little boy who plays her son is adorable and Colin Farrell gives a unexpectedly effective turn as the country music star Blake mentored, but every frame of Crazy Heart belongs to Bridges, plain and simple.<br/><br/>He sort of evokes a cross between Kris Kristofferson and Nick Nolte in his performance, but it's genuinely heartfelt nonetheless, not a caricature. As always, he gets inside the character, inhabiting him from a profoundly deep place, and it's this quality which makes what he does seem so effortless - by becoming the person so completely, so intimately, we forget he's acting but rather we feel as if we're almost intruding on his life in a voyeuristic way when we watch him. <br/><br/>Crazy Heart isn't a great movie by any stretch - it gets hugely simplistic toward the end - but it's good enough to leave us feeling that we've experienced something authentic, that we've spent time with someone worthwhile."

","All the Oscar hype for Jeff Bridges is indeed warranted. In fact, the main reason to see the film has to be to observe his wonderful performance. The film itself is typical of most independent fare. It's slow, meticulous and plodding but still manages to deliver enough to keep a viewer barely interested. At times, I liked this film better than The Wrestler (to which it is often compared) but at times it wasn't as gripping or intense as that film. Overall, it's a pleasant experience. Bridge's performance reaches greatness even if the story itself does not. It's well worth the watch for the acting but it's certainly not a film to own or watch more than once."

","Crazy Heart stars Jeff Bridges as Bad Blake, a country music singer whose glory days are behind him. He plays bars and bowling alleys, drinking and smoking his way into oblivion. At a two day stint in Santa Fe, Bad meets Jean (Maggie Gyllenhaal), an young reporter trying find her story. Just like a country song, the two fall for each other.<br/><br/>Not all is well in the life of Bad Blake. His drinking and smoking habits have him on the ropes and he is always reminded of his former apprentice, Tommy Sweet (Colin Farrell), and how successful he is. The two had a falling out and went their separate ways. Every day seems to be a reminder of what was and what could be, but might not be. Instead of sitting down and writing some more tunes, Bad finds solace in his never empty bottle of booze.<br/><br/>Bad gets a shot at something special both in his career and in his love life. Jean offers some stability and Bad gets an offer to perform as Tommy's opening act, a sort of slap in the face to Bad, but it's a paycheck. He and Tommy reminisce about the old days of singing and drinking. With Jean and her young son, Bad finds a nice home, at least for a little while. Things go from better to worse when his drinking gets him in more trouble than he can chew.<br/><br/>The story is a reminder of embracing the moment. Bad goes through his life mostly or partially intoxicated, missing a lot of good things and passing up on some potentially beneficial situations. Bridges gives his best performance in years. He is almost a serious Jeff Lebowski, a character he made famous in the 90s in Joel and Ethan Coen's The Big Lebowski. We sympathize with Bad Blake, though we never really feel sorry because it is his own fault really for being the way he is.<br/><br/>Gyllenhaal gives a solid performance, as do Farrell in Robert Duvall, both taking smaller less significant roles. The real winner of this movie isn't the acting (though without Bridges, the film would not be nearly as good). The far and away best part of this movie is the music. Original tracks by T-Bone Burnett, Stephen Bruton, Ryan Bingham, Gary Nicholson, and Greg Brown. In These men put together a fantastic collection of well written and musically enticing tracks. The theme from the film entitled ""The Weary Kind"" is one of the best original songs I've heard in a long time. Bingham and Burnett wrote it and Bingham performs it. His voice is crackly, as if he has been singing for 30 years or so. In reality Bingham is in his late 20s, but his voice is that of a veteran singer. It's a beautiful song and a perfect addition to the film. Other tracks like ""Fallin and Flying"", ""Gone, gone, gone"" and ""Hold on you"" are fantastic.<br/><br/>Overall a very good film. Bridges takes care of the acting portion and the rest is taken over by the music. Not that the rest of the film is particularly weak, I just think that those two pieces of the film are the strongest and stand out the most. It's a great story that people who are fans of country music will devour. I hope those people out there opposed to country music will give this film a shot. It will be well worth it."
"actodea","8","1","3","18 February 2010"," A fabulous baker boy meets the Wrestler
","I liked this movie and I think Jeff Bridges has done a great job. But is this enough for the Oscar?<br/><br/>It's been 20 years since he played a musician. This time he moves from jazz to country and he's a little older. It starts just like the Wrestler, where I believe Mickey Rourke has done a much better job (having a much better script) and then comes a beautiful story but I'm not going too spoil it too much because I think this movie should be watched.<br/><br/>I was amazed to find out that Bridges actually plays guitar and even released an album where he plays acoustic guitar. When I watched the movie I thought he should have learned to strum for this part but now I realize it's the director fault that I wasn't convinced that he can actually play. His right hand (the strumming hand) didn't feel right; he seemed to only move the wrist (without the arm) which, of course, doesn't really work. His left hand was more convincing but still one time when he is shown changing from a G chord to a C chord his fingers move too slow and not simultaneous. If the guitar isn't convincing the singing is a big surprise. Jeff Bridges can sing!<br/><br/>If Bridges is not a great guitar player he is certainly a great actor. There's nothing more to say about him. Just great. Robert Duvall has a small part which adds value. Colin Farrell has a small part too and he acts fantastic. He can also sing very well. His accent is also perfect... you don't see too many guys from Dublin singing country music! I think Maggie Gyllenhaal acting wasn't really consistent and sometimes I didn't even believe she meant what she was saying. I may be wrong, she may have earned her Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>The script has some flaws, some things are too predictable and some aren't justified. Spoiler: How can Bad lose Buddy in that bar? The bar was empty, the kid went in a direction that had no other exits, the bartender (a guy in his fifties) was facing the exit almost the whole time and more than that, Bad was in a good shape. I had nightmares about losing a child at the mall and I'm sure it can happen quite fast but it's never going to happen like this.<br/><br/>Compared to the Wrestler, it's not as good. Bridges isn't as good as Rourke. Still, it's a great movie."

","I was drawn to pick up this film based on reviews of Jeff Bridges' performance. As the character Bad Blake, he's very good. But the picture itself is, well, pretty bad. My own reaction about half way through was immortalized by that phone booth Blake made a call to Jeannie from in the middle of the prairie. Seriously, what the heck was that phone booth doing there? I could belabor the point, but you know, I just couldn't stop laughing when I saw that.<br/><br/>Was there a point to this movie? I followed along just fine, but the pacing really bogged down after Bad lost Buddy. Where'd the kid go anyway? And above all, what did Jeannie (Maggie Gylllenhaal) ever see in Bad Blake to begin with? It's not like she seemed infatuated with his celebrity, what little of it might have been left by the time she interviewed him. What was the attraction? Bad could hardly stand up most of the time, and he apologized for his sleazy motel room more than once. It sure wasn't a physical thing, a blind woman could tell that Bad was no catch. I just didn't get it.<br/><br/>At least when Bridges got to sing, he didn't sound half Bad. Sorry, couldn't resist the pun. Other than that, I'd hate to go out on a limb and recommend the film as something you just have to see. That would be a bum steer. That would also be Bad Blake's back up band on the road in New Mexico. Couldn't resist that one either."

At times, I felt as though I was talking to Bad directly. But more importantly, ""Crazy Heart"" has some of the best music that I've heard in movies in years. I've heard some good country music, but I don't think that I ever realized how great it can be until now (which is probably thanks to Bridges's masterful interpretation of the role).<br/><br/>This movie is definitely one that I recommend to everyone.

","""Crazy Heart"" opens with panoramic shots of a lone pickup truck traversing the barren landscape on a road to nowhere. It's driver used to be somebody, a big-time country music star, back when Nashville was full of renegades, larger-than-life men who lived hard and never gave a second thought about the consequences. But tastes change, and old school artists like Bad Blake(Jeff Bridges) watched Nashville sell-out its bluegrass roots toward a more polished sound, an amalgamation of pop and country in order to move beyond its niche market and into the mainstream. Still, the aura of celebrity hangs around Bad Blake which allows the has-been to tour the country, a circuit consisting of bowling alleys and juke joints whose clientele while long in the tooth, appreciates real country music in the Hank Williams tradition. At the peak of his career, Bad Blake embodied his adjectival moniker with pride, romancing his hard-living ways in song, his art, a justification for all the people he disappointed over the years. ""Crazy Heart"" is about a man who has seen his alias metamorphosize into a judgment, and is seeking deliverance from the naming he once took pride in, with the help of a young female journalist, who has the power to give Bad his name back.<br/><br/>Jean Craddock(Maggie Gyllenhall), a budding music journalist for a local Tucson paper, breaks the golden rule that Lester Bangs imparted to young William Miller in Cameron Crowe's ""Almost Famous"", which was, ""You never make friends with the rock stars."" During their first meeting in a shabby motel room, Bad asks Jean not to snap any pictures, candid pictures that would suggest his down-and-out existence of alcoholism and destitution. But he grants permission to shoot him while he's performing, which she does, at a low-angle, so that Bad Blake looms large, heroic, and nothing like the disheveled man with a gut we saw back at the motel room. And once Jean starts sleeping with Bad, her story becomes compromised. What Bad needed was an expose, not a puff-piece; an expose which detailed his long-running demons would have been the wake-up call he needed to get sober. Although Jean knows the whole story, she only writes about Bad's good points; a compromised story which compromises her heart, because she edits out his alcoholism, not only in her capacity as a journalist, but as a mother, as well, when she puts her four-year-old boy in Bad's care. In essence, she dates her puff-piece; she hurts everybody- herself, her son, and even Bad, because she didn't write the whole story. It's as if Jean needed to see the pictures that Bad asked her not to take for perspective.<br/><br/>As a result of her relationship with Jean, Bad writes a song called ""The Weary Kind"" for his protégé Tommy Steele(Colin Farrell), a successful artist in the new Nashville tradition. Since the song is a smash, an argument can be made that being bad is good for the singer/songwriter. Being bad is what informs his art, albeit at the expense of a fruitful personal life. The song was supposed to be a happy one, a song about Jean when their future looked promising. Thanks to Tommy, the song acts as a beacon in which Bad hopes Jean hears his plea of undying love and lure her back. But when Jean shows up backstage after a concert, the diamond ring on her finger instantly turns ""The Weary Kind"" into an elegy. All he has left is the song."

","The acting was well done, too bad the story has been overdone. I am a bit surprised they could not get one of the more seasoned country singers to act this part - with the exception of Willie Nelson since he already did the same story, 'Honeysuckle Rose' which had plenty of good music and everything else was awful. Well yeehaw I wandered off-topic. Let me jingle-jangle back to this movie. It hit the trail-a-blazin' but somewhere along the way that darned story line was hornswoggled and struggled to make it to the barn. (As you can tell I am attempting to write Hollywood-Western-Speech - too many westerns I'm thinking.) Talking' about struggling to finish it is almost like no one knew how to corral the herd (i.e. plot) and just shot the poor thing. Pardner I am not complaining, but this here movie ended all-of-a-sudden-like. It almost was like hopping off a rock into a creek and smacking your head on a log – not what I would expect. Now if them writing fellas had done the whole movie like this – it would have made me as happy as a turkey in a rainstorm. (Hmmmm, that don't sound quite right – I may have to come up with something else but I think 'happy as a bull in a dairy farm' might be too happy.) I guess I am just too hard on this movie. I gotta tell ya'all there were things I liked about this flick. A'kin to Jeff's swell acting I really liked the fact the lights were out in the the-a-tor so I could take a real good nap; the popcorn was really buttery and tasty, and the soda was all full of bubbles and sugar, kind-a-the way I like it. The singer's granddaughter was real pretty toooh wait.that was his girlfriendoopsforgot that this was a Hollywood movie. Anywaysthe scenery was good and the honkytonk experience was pretty cool.

I particularly liked the screen play with the various settings , sprinkled over the Southwestern states and the rest of the supporting cast, Duvall and Farrel in particular were mighty fine. Now for my problem. As I have said the storyline was good, ranging from losing a boy to Bad Blake trying to reconnect with his 'now', adult son. Some tears , some laughs and holding ones interest. I rambled now heres my BUT. I thought this film was cheapened by having Bad Blake having a sexual relationship with Jean Craddock. At this point the film became a caricature , a cliché if you will of many other films. This film could have been very special , if the relationship between Jean and Bad was simply one of platonic friends. I do not understand why film makers/book writers feel they have to make every main relationship of a film into a sexual and/or love relationship. This film would have stood on its own without the hanky panky and that is the saddest part of this."

","""Crazy Heart"" is one of those movies that you've already seen before, but you won't mind too much seeing it again with these characters and these actors. It's a typical ""sunset of a legend"" picture, complete with the wayward protégé, young saintly lover, and inspirational comeback. Along the way we're entertained by a number of decent songs.<br/><br/>I don't really take any exception to the praise for Jeff Bridges' performance. He's always been a good actor and it was fun to see him perform this type of larger-than-life role. Given the similarities of this role to his work in Terry Gilliam's ""Tideland"", this performance is basically another in the series of actors working with Gilliam and then turning their lessons towards more conventional fare to earn rave reviews. Which I have no problem with basically. His performance is solid, Duvall is solid even in a stupid mechanical role (the ""best friend/bartender who will help him get off alcohol... really?), Gyllenhaal does her best as the ""Saint Single Mommy"" character given to her. Colin Farrell seems awfully out of place but maybe that was the point.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the early honky-tonk scenes, there's a lot of authenticity I think to the way the concert scenes are shown, both the bowling-alley small town scene and the big arena shows. The movie goes off the rails for me about the point when he takes the single mom and her adorable son on a ballooning trip. It just starts going rapidly downhill into the areas of cheap sentiment and convenient plot twists. This is the #1 lazy Hollywood formula: when in need of an emotional hook, grab a cute kid and put them in danger. Gets 'em every time. Spielberg taught us that and now every other film imitates the lame formula. I was disengaged with the movie when it got into that kind of thing, just sort of exploiting people's fear of missing children in order to accomplish a strictly mechanical goal (motivating the character to clean up).<br/><br/>I also wasn't crazy that the film showed his only way out as being to attend some 12-step program. Those people and that whole industry didn't need the free promotion. Ah, look how peaceful it is here in this rehab setting! Yes, huge insurance payments will do that. Inner peace? Not to be found in a ring of AA zombies or a finely manicured forest walkway with stream running through it. I would find more inner peace drinking Pabst Blue Ribbon fishing with Robert Duvall. The film manufactures a crisis in his health and then the really contrived situation with the missing child, just so that it can show that he couldn't keep being ""Bad"" forever. The drama didn't arise from the situations; the situations arose from the writers' need for drama. This wouldn't be so glaring if so much of the rest of the movie wasn't so down-to-earth and understated (for instance, the restraint they showed in not turning Farrell's Tommy Sweet character into a bad guy).<br/><br/>It's a mixed bag: Jeff Bridges fans should see it, people who like melancholy romantic dramas should see it, but those who are looking for a really exciting treatment will not find it.<br/><br/>Incidentally, I have a sort of personal connection to the film: a couple weeks ago I saw the 2010 Bridge School Benefit, where the producer of this movie T. Bone Burnett performed 2 of the songs along with Jeff Bridges. Pretty cool. Kris Kristofferson also played earlier in the day. A coincidence? Perhaps...."

","I did not know that Jeff Bridges won an Oscar for this until I was a quarter into it. I was shocked. The first thing I thought was that it must have been a very weak field, indeed. I love Jeff Bridges but you can see every bone in his body acting as he tries but fails to find the character or a great performance. Too obvious, insincere Kristofferson gravely voice. He has done better and for which he deserved an Oscar. Shame he got one for this, and I imagine he is more than a little sheepish, esp if he is the genuine actor I think he is and can still see through his ego.<br/><br/>This movie has been made many times, and much, much better. Tender Mercies, Payday, A Star is Born, Rock Star (even the Kristofferson version is much, much better than this movie, and you get the real guy). Not to mention more recent fare, like Walk the Line and the James Brown biopic (I dare you to compare Juaquin Phoenix's Johnny Cash to Bridges here!). That is a list of movies to see and unlike this one, they are memorable in a way that makes you rewatch them. True Oscar worthy performances in many. There is not a creative bone anywhere in this movie. The writing and direction are phoned in. Character motivation is zip, esp for Maggie Gyllenhaal, which makes the relationship between them gross. No convincing motivation for anyone. Colin Farrell is the class of the cast in his small role as Bridges' old student now famous. In a *good* movie, Farrell wouldn't have stood out as much, as the bar would have been so much higher and Farrell's performance expected.<br/><br/>Robert Duvall has a couple scenes (fitting, since this tries to be Tender Mercies II) and in one he manages to completely negate and dehumanize a Mexican immigrant. The truly sad thing and why I bring this up is that this scene is completely redundant and unnecessary. Duvall speaks Spanish to a guy he calls 'Jesus', who is pushing a mop pail across the floor. Duvall abruptly says, irritated, ""Someday I am going to teach you English!"". When Juan or Bridges (I forget and am NOT watching it again) points out that his name is really Juan, Duvall says, ""Juan, Jesus, whatever your name is, who cares?"" Juan is immediately turned into ""one of those"". The man is not important enough to be correctly named. Just ""one of THEM"", even though he is the only one left who is helping keep the bar open and has perhaps known Duvall a while. No, there was no appearance of Duvall being a spacey old coot, just mean-spirited and as if Juan was generic and replaceable, as many see immigrants. Duvall is powerful enough that he doesn't have to speak lines like that, but he did. I am just wondering how desperate Richard Gallegos was to do the role of Juan. They could have written any character into that role. Duvall's character's crusty old wife, a crusty old friend, his son, his best friend, and on and on. To be fair, the doctor who attends Bridges', earlier, seems to be Hispanic (they ARE in New Mexico and Arizona, after all) and that was a very good call. But that good diversity moment was negated with this unforgivable, stereotypical and insulting scene. <br/><br/>But the director must take all responsibility for this nonsense, in the end. So he has written a terrible script (not just because of this, which seemed ad libbed, anyway) and directed a terrible movie, shot like a commercial, only slower. We never get a good look at some of the beautiful scenery the movie is shot in. I have lived in the southern New Mexico wasteland and was looking forward to that odd beauty, as well as driving into the gorgeous mountains as you go north, but the cinematographer doesn't allow us to settle our gaze upon the scenery."

","Those who feverishly follow live music performances may relate more closely to this film than most. But I doubt that even country music fans would get much out of if by way of musical enjoyment. Jeff Bridges does play and sing, as do Colin Farrell and some others, but most of the music is in short segments. And those, often with interruptions or breaks of some sort. <br/><br/>Mostly this is a movie about a musician years past his prime, who makes his living playing to the middle-aged folks who liked his music in the past. He does this in restaurants, bowling alleys, and bars. Part of his being beyond his prime is his lifestyle. Bridges plays Bad Blake, an alcoholic who writes and sings ""authentic"" country western tunes. But, he hasn't done anything new in years. Now he goes from town to town across the Western U.S., playing for a living. He stays in sleazy or rundown motels. The rest of his lifestyle includes bedding down whatever camp follower presents herself for the night. <br/><br/>A romance enters his life in a much younger woman who has a four-year-old son. It's as though this one particular acquaintance on the road clicks where none before have. That's a little hard to believe. But the dysfunction of Blake's person and lifestyle finally wake up Jean (played by Maggie Gyllenhaal), who calls it quits. This apparently has been different enough from Blake's usual encounters that it leads him to despair and he finally asks for help to battle his alcoholism. While not the way Blake wants it, the film has a sort of hopeful and appropriate ending. <br/><br/>The film is based on a 1987 novel of the same title, by Thomas Cobb. That story was inspired by honky-tonk country-Western musician Hank Thompson (1925-2007). <br/><br/>Bridges won the Academy Award for best actor for his role. This isn't the type of film that offers musical entertainment, as do most musicals. It's not fun picture to watch, but some viewers may appreciate it for the drama and Blake's rehab."

But choosing the film was more effective than the Jeff bridges in the mix. The man is still very good, as always, and the golden sphere that he has received deserves it to the end. He plays a very challenging role as a child's playboy, and the songs we have listened to throughout the film are like the Collin Farrell, which he says directly, and in this, we can call it an up version of the character big Lebesgue, it reminded. For example, the first sensation is the drop-off stage of the loo ...<br/><br/>I will not go on to mention the story of Colin Farrell, Filmin is definitely a weak link himself. I have heard criticism of bad actors about him for years, but this prejudice has never occurred and I can see clearly that the phone booth filming is very fond of me, but plays a relatively simple role, except for the parts he says in this movie.<br/><br/>In fact, it has come very successfully from a very high risk of being overly sensitive to the viewer's detachment from the film.

"sol-","Null","0","1","28 January 2017"," The Big Blake
","Frequently compared to 'Tender Mercies', both films feature ageing, alcoholic country singers finding new love and newfound success, however, 'Crazy Heart' spins a noticeably different story. Most notably, the character of Bad Blake (played by Jeff Bridges) in 'Crazy Heart' is still an active singer at the start of the film and one who has zero interest dealing with his alcohol problem. This in turns renders Blake a more interesting character as he has to find it in himself to recognise how much alcohol is ruining his life. He also has a lot more personal growth as he becomes aware that his hedonistic lifestyle is not compatible with his newfound romance. Whatever the case, Bridges shines in the lead role which almost feels tailor-made to his sensibilities; in fact, the very first scene of the film places Bridges at a bar in a bowling alley in an obvious reference to 'The Big Lebowski' - the title character of which has some curious similarities to Blake. There were some questions raised at the time as to whether Bridges deserved to win the Oscar that year or whether it was more of a lifetime achievement award. Viewing the film though, it is hard to imagine how such concerns ever came about as this is easily one of his finest turns. The less said about also Oscar nominated Maggie Gyllenhaal the better though as her romance with Bridges never quite rings true. The film is also set back by the frequency of the musical numbers, which sometimes get in the way of the story developing. That said, the songs ARE that good with Bridges even doing his own singing."

","Although the film is described as drama, it's very much downbeat romantic drama, which makes the final twenty minutes a disappointment.<br/><br/>Jeff Bridges gives a suitably unflattering performance as washed-up alcoholic country singer Bad Blake. Whilst the Oscar might be overdoing it, it's a solid performance and Bad is suitably touching in his interactions with Buddy, Bad's journist girlfriend Jean's son (Maggie Gyllenhall).<br/><br/>There is as you might have guessed an age-gap between Bad and Jean. Whilst I could believe in his relationship with Jean in the context of her son, as a loving friendship, I found their sexual relationship a little unsavoury. It's not that it's graphic but it's just a bit unpleasant, considering Bad is not only much older than her, he's in bad shape. To be fair, she doesn't see the extent to which he is an alcoholic.<br/><br/>As a romantic drama with some country music to reflect the bluesy nature of Bad's alcoholism, the film worked. But- and this is where the SPOILER comes in- the film falls at the final hurdle. After the moment when Bad hits his low point as he loses Jean's son, Jean tells him to sober up and not come back again. He seemingly sobers up pretty darn quickly with no real side effects and whilst I understand that this is because he needs to do it for his own health, the film implies that Jean will one day allow him back in to rebuild the relationship. Eighteen months down the line, Bad has written a nice song (naturally inspired by Jean, although lyrically not seeming to be relevant) and his career is back on track. Jean turns up and what do you know, she's engaged to a 'nice' man. We do see some character development as Bad takes the news gracefully, but seeing as she was meant to be in love with the guy, would she so readily bounce into bed with someone else? The way she says 'nice' also indicates that she's marrying him purely for the security, which makes her a pretty weak character. It would have been much better to see her doing well in her own right rather than a hasty marriage to counteract her troubled relationship with Bad.<br/><br/>NO MORE SPOILERS: The songs are a bit samey but not unpleasant. Colin Farrell has a surprisingly good cameo as Tommy Sweet, Bad's protégé.<br/><br/>Crazy Heart is fine if you want a gentle downbeat film; it just either needed more grit or more sweetness, rather than sweetness that sours."

","Yup, just like that. The story is just a common one in musicals, where a rising star or a veteran, in this case a veteran, struggles with his life due to the overwhelming lifestyle, the by product of free paradigm of stardom and celebrity status. The movie's quite good because of the live performances by Jeff Bridges and Colin Farrell themselves. The performances not only showcase the actors other potential as singers, but are also engineered well, both the indoors and the outdoor concerts, to be readily enjoyed as they are. The conflicts portrayed in the movie are some common themes found in the similar movies, even the conflict climax, the turning point moments, and the reconciliations are commonplace. But the acting overall is a good one. Jeff Bridges gives a bit of nice touches by trying to go total here. Maggie Gyllehaal gives the right edges this story needs to be complete. And while his role is quite complimentary, Colin Farrell can complete this movie with his nice acting and singing. It's quite entertaining for me."

","CRAZY HEART tells a familiar tale of a washed-up country music singer Otis (aka Bad) Blake (Jeff Bridges), who spends much of his time touring seedy venues in New Mexico and Texas, singing his old songs and drinking himself to distraction. He takes up with journalist Jean Craddock (Maggie Gyllenhaal), but this relationship comes to grief when Bad inadvertently loses her four-year-old son Buddy (Jack Nation) in a crowded shopping mall. Bad ends up sharing a bill with his one-time protegé Tommy Sweet (Colin Farrell); while resenting the latter's success, Bad eventually comes to realize that Tommy will provide him with the only means of financial salvation. If Bad writes new songs, Tommy will sing them and pay handsomely. Jeff Bridges gives a bravura performance in the central role - at once aggressive, vulnerable, pig- headed, lonely yet self-willed, he comes across as someone in perpetual need of human company, yet reluctant to reveal anything about himself to others. It is as if he cannot bear to face the truth about his washed- up show-business career, or his descent into alcoholism. The photography by Barry Markowitz is breathtaking, especially his ability to show the insignificance of human beings - and their actions - when set against the rolling landscape. Tommy might be able to play in front of 12,000 people, but he can never achieve immortality. The only criticism that might be leveled at Scott Cooper's film is the ending, which shows Bad making rather too speedy a recovery, while making some unconvincing suggestions about Jean's life once she has split up with Bad. Would someone with such a professed reputation for finding the wrong man be so happily married now? Bad's recovery from alcoholism seems equally forced; for someone with such a long relationship with the bottle, it seems inconceivable that he should be cured after just one course of treatment. Nonetheless CRAZY HEART is well worth watching, if only for Bridges' performance."

","Bad Blake is an ageing country singer with health problems whose career is fizzling out. But when he simultaneously meets the intriguing Jean and is offered a guest shot at a big concert, his luck seems to have turned. Can he capitalise on this good fortune ?<br/><br/>This gentle, easygoing drama is a very simple bittersweet story, but pretty much every aspect of it is beautifully done. All the characters are interesting, multi-faceted, painfully recognisable and extremely well played. Blake is a bit of a loser; he smokes too much, drinks too much, runs away from responsibility and complains a lot, but he's kinda earned the right to do so from years of vagabond travel and baring his soul through his music. It's easy to identify with a man who has grown disillusioned and tired of feeling exploited but lacks the courage to try and accept his faults or change his destiny. Bridges is pretty sensational (but then he almost always is), throwing himself into the part, and his singing carries exactly the right mixture of weariness and sentimentality. Everybody else is great too - Gyllenhaal makes us focus on what Blake is missing, Farrell (who also sings) has a scene-stealing part as Tommy Sweet, the protégé who has become a top draw, and Duvall is terrific as ever (I love his reaction when he discovers Blake passed out from puking in the bathroom). The film is also full of fabulous toe-tapping music by Stephen Bruton and T-Bone Burnett, which peps up the gentle pacing and moves in and out of the narrative seamlessly. Produced on a very modest budget by first-time director Cooper, Bridges, Burnett and Duvall amongst others, this was a financial success and won Oscars for both Best Actor and Best Song. Featuring great photography throughout by Barry Markowitz, with highly evocative use of the terrific New Mexico locations, this both sounds and looks like an authentic country and western picture. Based on a novel by Thomas Cobb and dedicated to Bruton (a longtime guitarist for Kris Kristofferson) who sadly passed away prior to the movie's release, this would make a great double bill with Duvall's similarly themed 1983 film Tender Mercies."

Not bad at all for a movie and you could well believe that some of the tracks could have been big hits for the star, as the story requires.<br/><br/>The basic story line covers all of the bases that you would expect of a down-on-his-luck-faded-star-who-seeks-redemption and doesn't wander far from the well worn path.<br/><br/>There are two areas where this movie obtains redemption: Firstly; the supporting cast is an 'A' list of actors from Maggie Gyllenhaal portraying the damaged woman every man would want through to an underused but always welcome Robert Duvall.<br/><br/>Secondly; the lead role is played by Jeff Bridges who you never once think is acting - he IS the character.

","""Crazy Heart"" sees actor Jeff Bridges playing a washed up country singer with one last chance to salvage his career and make amends with his family, whom he abandoned a long time ago in favour for life on the road. Sounds familiar? The film has been compared to Darren Aronofsky's ""The Wrestler"", but most people don't seem to realise that Aronofsky's film was itself a giant bag of clichés.<br/><br/>What ""Crazy Heart"" has going for it are a series of brilliant sequences in which Bridges mopes around dimly lit bars, chewing on tobacco, sucking on booze, flirting with 40 year old groupies and playing some fine country music. These moody scenes, somewhat detached from the film's formulaic plot, make you wish Bridges' character were in a different movie.<br/><br/>When we're not in the pleasant company of musicians, barflies and bartenders, we're watching Bridges go through familiar plot beats. He hooks up with a young woman (Maggie Gyllenhaal) and her son, battles alcoholism, struggles to fit within the current market place, struggles to write new songs and has awkward telephone conversations with his long lost son. It's all very formulaic and contrived, the characters only very thinly sketched.<br/><br/>Still, the film is magnificently acted, and other than its bar room shenanigans has 3 more good things going for it. Actor Colin Farrell turns up as a country singer and is given an interesting subplot, the film has several cute allusions to ""The Big Lebowski"" (bowling alleys, the business with Bridges and the toilet, the names of characters etc), and contains several great singing and song-writing sequences.<br/><br/>7.9/10 – A very formulaic film with another creepy relationship between a young woman and a much older man. Still, the film's worth watching for its atmosphere. For this plot done better, see ""Tender Mercies"" with Robert Duvall, ""The Thing Called Love"", Hal Ashby's ""Bound For Glory"", Altman's ""Prairie Home Companion"" and ""Nashville"", ""Sweet Dreams"", ""Songwriter"", ""Coal Miners Daughter"" and ""Be Here To Love Me: A Film About Townes Van Zandt"".<br/><br/>Worth one viewing."

","I must admit here that I'm not into music. I don't have a problem with music, it's just that I'm not addicted & can only somewhat tell genres & instruments apart. And after Mickey Rourke got an Oscar nomination last year for The Wrestler, I thought this was just ""another"" similar film. Maybe that's the reason I avoided this film initially. But when I saw Jeff Bridges get his long-pending Oscar for this & read about all the other awards he got, I was ashamed & managed to catch up with it as soon as I could.<br/><br/>It narrates the story of good ol' country singer Bad Blake (Jeff Bridges) who manages to find inspiration in the evening days of his life after a tempestuous relationship with a young Journalist (Maggie Gyllenhaal). He's had his days of glory & can still compose an impromptu line or two to impress a girl. He's still famous among the old shopkeepers who probably used to hear him on the radio in their shops. But, the younger generation identifies with singer Tommy Sweet (Colin Farrell) who was trained by Bad & even sings songs written by him. Blake remains drunk & broke for most of the time now. It's not easy for such a man to give up his pride. But Blake has to. The phone call scene where he agrees to open for his protégé Tommy shows these struggling layers of pride and need for money. He cant refuse any of the work he gets from his loyal secretary (Paul Herman) and also from Tommy, who gratefully acknowledges him in every show he does.<br/><br/>Maybe this was a cliché but I found many points like the supportive friend (Robert Duvall), the acknowledging protégé, the understanding girlfriend etc. which many a times work against the helpless protagonist but actually help him out here. Also, in such movies, it tends to become boring but the music (Bingham & Burnett) doesn't allow that here. In fact, the best part of this feel-good movie (apart from Bridges) was obviously the music, which I enjoyed even without any idea of music especially Fallin' & Flyin', Hold on You, Somebody Else & (the Oscar winning) The Weary Kind. Jeff made it believable by lending his own peppery voice to many of the songs. The screenplay (by director Scott Cooper) based on a novel by the same name doesn't have a biographical story with a definite start-end. And it is never preachy with underlying morality or traumatic speeches at any point which made it impressive.<br/><br/>A career-defining role for Jeff Bridges, who will be remembered for this as he will be for The Big Lebowski.<br/><br/>As Maggie said in the movie - Is this what you call the ""old country charm"" ?

","I had heard a little about this film because of the talk about the Academy Awards, and everyone had high predictions that the leading actor of this film would win, and he did, I had to see why. Basically fifty-seven year old Otis 'Bad' Blake (Oscar and Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated Jeff Bridges) is a minor legend of country and western music, but that status only allows him to play low-rate gigs, such as in bowling alleys, he only has a standing gig at the bar of Wayne Kramer (Robert Duvall) in Houston. Bad is an overweight, chain-smoking alcoholic, and he needs a break, and while performing in Sante Fe he meets aspiring newspaper journalist Jean Craddock (Oscar nominated Maggie Gyllenhaal) who wants an interview. Despite an age difference, they soon begin a close relationship, and he also gets to know Jean's four year old son Buddy (Jack Nation) very well, the more time they spend together the more like a family they are becoming. Bad's career may have a chance to get back on track when he meets his old friend in the music industry, fellow country and western singer and touring partner Tommy Sweet (Colin Farrell) who wants him to write some new songs. Bad is devastated when Jean leaves him after his self-destructive drunkenness, which a doctor warned him could kill him quickly, makes him let Buddy get lost. Bad makes a big decision and tells his Manager (James Keane) that he wants to get sober, for both his career and for a chance to get back with Jean, and his trip to rehabilitation really pays off. Months pass by without one drink, and he has succeeded in writing a new song for Tommy to sing in one of his big live shows, and even though Jean has a ring on her finger, he still gives her an eighteenth birthday present for Buddy, and they have a little picnic. Also starring Tom Bower as Bill Wilson. The leading star with his slurring and depressive character makes for good watching, he has a quite good singing voice too, as does Farrell in his scenes, Gyllenhaul does really well too. It might be a really simple story, but there is enough to pluck at your heartstrings and make you care for the characters and what happens to them, so it is a worthwhile music drama.

Someone else wrote that the direction seemed similar to a made-for-television film, and I have to agree.

I'm not saying alcoholism can't be overcome by someone if they have enough willpower...but I just found the resolution to be a little too convenient and rushed.<br/><br/>Bridges keeps this movie afloat, as well as its impressive country music soundtrack.

Aside from it, only the country songs composed by T-Bone Burnett are up to scratch. I admit it although I'm not really keen on country music. Other than that, Crazy Heart suffers from utterly conventional script most of all. One can usually predict the major plot points before they take place, which seldom makes for gripping cinema. Scott Cooper, who also wrote the script, doesn't provide enough material to make a truly demanding film resembling last year's The Wrestler. Instead, Crazy Heart happens to be too light for its own good. We nearly don't care though because Bridges' performance is so captivating and truthful. Other actors fail to a degree because the writing is so unremarkable. Maggie Gyllenhaal just doesn't have enough material to play a juicy dramatic role and her relationship with Bridges seems to be rushed. Although the subplot with Colin Farrell starring as a country star influenced by Bad is quite interesting, the movie just doesn't let it develop properly.

Jeff Bridges carries this movie, which has a significantly flat and predictable story, however.<br/><br/>What's worst about the story (or rather the script) is that it's streamlined after a certain school of writing, which still turns screenplays into three-act setups. Sure, it makes it easier to write a script that way, but this type of script always feels the same, because of the pace rather than the quality of what's shown.<br/><br/>This could have been a brilliant movie (and here's one difference to ""Walk the Line"": compassion for the protagonists. Instead I felt like roles were filled out according to the plan. Maggie plays the overprotective mother, who cannot stop worrying about her son. She is overtly responsible for her life, because her son depends on her maturity. Jeff plays just the opposite and the scene where he loses the boy in the shopping mall is plain stupid.<br/><br/>First of all - an Alcoholic doesn't get drunk off one whiskey like that. Secondly - it's not like the same thing doesn't happen to other people around the world millions of times. If you can't blame it on your alcoholism, losing a child in a dense mall is just accepted as ""can happen"", or so it seems.<br/><br/>I'm complaining here, because this is the key scene to the entire movie. It doesn't even matter that you know about it now, because each scene depends on another. Yet, to make this the big climax seems as generic as it gets.<br/><br/>My conclusion! You have: great acting, predictable and generic plot, climax in the wrong place, neutral ending. From a writer's perspective Crazy Heart is neither original nor decisive. It doesn't glorify anything. It doesn't have any morale and the change Jeff/Bad undergoes is very superficial. In the end, his manager and the douchebag Garth Brooks clone run his life for him. He's just ""with the show"", not running it. Bad has become what he always feared the most: a functioning member of the society he sings about. A cog in a machine that will run with or without him. This script has no honesty, it just wants to get done with its plot-points. In the end ""Bad"" achieved nothing and an honest drunk is more worth to me than a sober liar."

","We follow the life story of a reckless man who leads a hasty life and is unwilling to improve or change anything and is caught between his unruliness and the charm he still transcends as a once known performer. Interestingly, or perhaps not, just before his life took a turn the only time he shied was when asked about his children. A chance encounter that leads to unexpected romance is the beginning of a much needed change and a drive for self improvement. The willingness to improve takes a boost by the support he received from his protégé who not only is now more successful than he is but in a rare act of recognition and gratefulness he is there for his mentor in such challenging times. It's as if when we cannot pick ourselves up we need others to do it for us and this is exactly what Crazy Heart finds in his path plus the accident he suffered fully implanted the need to change his ways as he went forward. A period of happiness follows where he finally opens up about his long lost son and even in that happy period comes close to get derailed but the companions in life keep him firmly in track. Towards the end he pays the price for not completely giving up his bad habits thus losing the good thing he had, resulting in the ""enforced way"" of self-improvement. Post-recovery, as he tries to built bridges he finds that they are closed for good but we are pleased to see that instead of going back to his old habits he becomes creative in this state of lonely grief."

","Cooper's 'Crazy Heart' works better as a character study than a story driven piece of cinema. That is not to say that the story lacks meat. We initially follow bad, a talented musician but also an alcoholic, through his monotonous journey that involves broads, booze and music and in between he whines to his manager for a record deal. He's a friendly guy who's only occasionally a bit grumpy. Enter a young journalist, Jean, who wants to write an article and Bad's life begins to change. The romantic story is done with subtlety. I liked how clichés were avoided. The soundtrack is amazing. Just listen to the lyrics of each song (especially the last one) and you'll know how brilliant they are. Even the dialogues are offbeat and subtle with a great sense of humour. Moreover, Farrell and Bridges do nothing short of a fine job in the singing department. Now, the best thing about 'Crazy Heart' is undoubtedly Jeff Bridges. While Gyllenhaal, Farrell and Duvall are awesome, Bridges's tour de force performance overshadows everything else. On the down side, I thought the character Jean was underwritten and we pretty much only see her from Bad's point of view. 'Crazy Heart' is a simple, sincere and straightforward little film that one can easily appreciate and enjoy."

","Bad Blake, effortlessly played by Jeff Bridges, is the stereotypical broken down alcoholic country singer. He drives himself from town to town in a beat up truck playing bowling alleys and out of the way honky tonks, staying in flea bag motels all for the sake of supporting his addiction. In an opening scene Bad is in a liquor store, nearly broke trying to figure out the best bargain on cheap booze so he can perform that night. Luckily the owner recognizes him and proudly gives him a bottle of his favorite whiskey not realizing the desperate state the singer is in. Despite his condition Bad is a professional and manages to make it to the stage and perform night after night although his remaining hard core fans are happy just to see him in front of a microphone. <br/><br/>In Santa Fe Bad agrees to an interview with a local writer Jean, played by Maggie Gyllenhaal , a single mom half his age who immediately strikes him as something beautiful in the ugly world that his life has become. He charms her and her four year old son and an unlikely romance ensues. Whether Jean is naive or in denial about his drinking is unclear, she simply asks him not to drink around her son. Problems inevitably arise.<br/><br/>Although the plot is familiar, what sets Crazy Heart apart is its honest and unflinching portrait of alcoholism. There is nothing romantic about a musician or anyone else that doesn't want to but has to drink to make it through the day. Bad is simply a man like any other alcoholic who must hit his bottom before making a decision to change. <br/><br/>With his fifth nomination, Jeff Bridges appears to be a lock for the Academy Award. He is not just competent performing his songs he is believable. Bridges is that rare talented actor who never appears to be acting and he seamlessly incorporates that talent into his singing and playing. His unforgettable performance alone is worth a recommendation to see the film."

","""Crazy Heart"" is all about building Bridges (as in Jeff) to his long awaited well-deserved Best Actor Oscar? Well, maybe but that is not all of it. Jeff Bridges' exemplary starring performance as former country star legend Bad Blake was not (to say the least) half bad. In fact it was one of the best orchestrated by an actor in this country this year. The ""Crazy Heart"" narrative tic-tock focuses on Blake's struggles to make a country living; in not being the country crooner he used to be. He is not known by the present country fan generation, and quasi-followed by longtime country fans. Moreover, the bad about Bad is that he now plays in rinky-dink bars across the country instead of sold-out stadiums as he did during his heyday. Blake also plays that bottle like there is no tomorrow, he is bad to the liver bone; but somehow is able to perform satisfactorily at his small-time gigs. Blake lives day-by-day in the hierarchy of survival, even though on the back of his mind he knows that his hardcore alcohol & nicotine habits will end his country life in the near future. Bad does take in some good southern comfort in a beautiful & wholesome music reporter named Jean Craddock who wants it real bad from Bad. OK, that was bad! I meant to say was that Jean falls for Bad. Blake, who has been divorced four times, takes a liking to his ""I Dream of Jeanie"" country gal; even though she is twenty years younger than him. First time Writer-Director Scott Cooper does a nice job in his vision & scribe of this small tale about an aging country star in the melancholy twilight of his career; sporadically it reminded me of Darren Aronofsky's wondrous small film ""The Wrestler"". My only sour note to Cooper is that the whole age-gap romance between Bad & Jean somehow did not seem authentic, and at times a bit country creepy. ""Crazy Heart"" also had thespian heart from its supporting players: Maggie Gyllenhaal was commendable as Jean (but not exactly Oscar-worthy), Colin Farrell marveled as country star & Blake disciple Tommy Sweet, and Robert Duvall was once again scene-stealing as bar owner & Bad pal Wayne. T-Bone Burnett's music of ""Crazy Heart"" was a t-bone well done! But now to helming more Bridges, Bridges, Bridges. Not only was his starring performance off the country charts, but Jeff also croons many of the tunes of the film. So have a heart, and see this infamous actor dude named Jeff Bridges do his badass acting thang in ""Crazy Heart"". **** Good"
