","Army of Darkness (1992) is in my opinion by far the best one of the ""Evil Dead"" trilogy! It is my second favorite film of the trilogy, I just love, love this movie to death!!!! It is my personal favorite horror movie in the Evil Dead series. The best one is the theatrical cut the rest versions are pure crap with lameness. The original cut kicks ass!!! Great movie! This movie is so silly, that it's actually funny. <br/><br/>I have always loved Army of Darkness and I always will. I love this film to death!!!! I was watching with my dad this film and even he loved it. So yes I proud to say I love this film and I have enjoyed More than the original The Evil Dead (1981) and Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn (1987)! This film has funny moments, balance, smart genius creativity, great babes, mystic forces and mystic knights in it.<br/><br/>Good, bad, I'm the guy with the gun. <br/><br/>Army of the dead who were actually skeletons were fabulous, the fights were awesome and they and they were highly enjoyable. The film was fast paced from the beginning till the end. I am sorry if you guys love Evil Dead 2 much better than this film, I just love Army of Darkness much better, this film is just a great worthy sequel to their predecessors. Ash is like ably hero on screen and he is one of the most popular hero's till it's days. Army of Darkness is a classic. Sam Raimi, Bruce Campbell, & the special effects masters KNB! You cant ask for more. Great story, funny lines, fantastic looking monsters. I don't care what anyone says I just love this film to death!!! <br/><br/>What we get in here is a hybrid of sorts with Bruce Campbell once again as Ash the reluctant hero fighting ghouls and goblins (well maybe not goblins) in the medieval times. This third chapter goes for more of the laughs rather then the scares and actually offers up a fun take on the genre mix director Sam Raimi tells. The movie is not as annoying as the previous 2 films and closes out the trilogy nicely. They are a lot of talks of an Army of Darkness 2 and I don't want any sequel to this horror/comedy flick. I thought this film closed the trilogy beautiful. There is a lots of comic relief, over the top cuts, BOOMSTICK!!!!! <br/><br/>Army of Darkness is my second favorite movie (Evil Dead II, Dark Knight, ARMY OF DARKNESS) and here's why. It follows the character of Ashley (Ash) J. Williams in his journey to the past that is far better explained in Evil Dead II. He is only able to be sent back to his own time (and his job at S Mart) if he finds the Necronomicon (Book of the Dead) which will also free the people who can help him from the attacks of the deadites. Ash has to find the book, get the babe, fight some demons, and get back home...like in the deal. This movie has it all, and some sugar, baby! It is a hilarious, gory, wonderful display of Bruce Campbell's ingenious acting ability, and anyone who says differently is a deadite. It's a film that would make Clive Barker proud. An oddball yet absolutely successful pairing of slapstick Comedy and undead Horror with a medieval setting thrown into the mix for good measure, 1992's Army of Darkness sits proudly near the top of the list of most unconventional yet absolutely entertaining motion pictures in history. Following up on 1981's oft-banned The Evil Dead and 1987's The Evil Dead II: Dead by Dawn (itself a Horror-Comedy hybrid), Army of Darkness represents the most accessible and audience-friendly of the three. Special effects; gore; humor; and of course, Bruce Campbell's over-the-top antics are Awesome!!! Hail to the king, baby.<br/><br/>Army of Darkness is a 1992 American dark fantasy action comedy film directed by Sam Raimi. It is the third installment of the Evil Dead franchise. The film was written by Sam Raimi and his brother Ivan, produced by Robert Tapert, and stars Bruce Campbell (also acting as co-producer) and Embeth Davidtz. Continuing from Evil Dead II, Ash Williams (Campbell) is trapped in the Middle Ages and battles the undead in his quest to return to the present.<br/><br/>Beyond in human flesh, inked in blood-and amazingly hard to pronounce-the ancient ""Necronomicon"" (Book of the Dead) unleashes unspeakable evil upon mankind in director Sam Raimi's (Spider-Man) outrageously hilarious sword-and-sorcery epic. Back to do battle with the hideous ""Deadites,"" Bruce Campbell reprises his role from the Evil Dead series as Ash, the handsome, shotgun-toting, chainsaw-armed department store clerk from S-Mart's housewares division. Demonic forces time warp him-and his '73 Oldsmobile-into England's Dark Ages, where he romances a beauty (Embeth Davidtz) and faces legions of undead beasts, including a ghastly army of skeletons. Can Ash save the living from the dead, rescue his girlfriend and get back to his own time? This movie is personal second favorite movie it is 10/10."
"Freddy Riedenschneider Fanclub","9","188","226","4 April 2001"," Not for the pretentious
","Most people would say you can check your brain at the door before you watch this film, but I beg to differ.  This is genuinely intelligent stuff here folks.  The director, Sam Raimi, reminds us in this film what it is like to have fun.  From the film itself, as well as the DVD featurettes, it is apparent that Mr. Raimi is having a blast doing what he does best.  It shows too.  Granted, there is not much in the line of plot or theme, but these would be totally gratuitous in this escapist piece.  Instead, we are given a fantastic adventure, appropriately tongue-in-cheek special effects, and an ode to The Three Stooges.  The facial expressions of Bruce Campbell alone make this film well worth its 80 minutes.  I don't want to give away a single joke, because the experience is just too much fun.  So, do yourself a favor.  Watch this film without being so hard on yourself.  Yes, you are allowed to laugh.  There can be non-sardonic humor in modern day America. Sam Raimi proves it."
"DarthBill","8","67","77","2 June 2004"," ""Well hello Mr. Fancy Pants.""
","Picking up where ""Evil Dead II"" left off in a somewhat altered opening, Bruce Campbell, now a full blown Han Solo smart ass, is trapped in the dark ages and is eventually found to be the one fated to the Deadites after he retrieves the Book of the Dead, which can also help send him back to his own time. But Bruce, being as stupid as he is, screws up the magic words that are meant to keep the Army of Darkness away and he ends up unleashing an army of undead skeletons by accident who are led by his evil alter ego. Now he must use his 20th century know how to save the day or else evil will forever rule the Earth. <br/><br/>Bruce is back and funnier than ever. No real horror here, more of a parody of a big budget fantasy adventure film. Sadly, a number of great gags were left on the cutting room floor that are generally only seen on extended DVD's and TV showings. <br/><br/>Hail to the King, baby."
"LebowskiT1000","8","171","206","13 May 2002"," One the funniest movies I've ever seen!
","I remember when this film just came out in the theater, I didn't know anything about the Evil Dead films and in fact hadn't even heard of them. From the previews I had ZERO desire to see this film.  The years went by and in late 2000 or maybe 2001 I finally decided to watch it, cause I'd heard so much about it and just couldn't take it anymore, I had to see what the fuss was about.  I was NOT disappointed!  This is probably one of the funniest movies I've ever seen!!!<br/><br/>This movie is definitely not for everyone though.  The comedy in this film is VERY odd, so I could understand if someone didn't find it funny at first. First thing you need to keep in mind is that this movie IS NOT trying to be serious, and most definitely doesn't take itself seriously.  The movie is just plain weird, but that's what makes it so great.  You really can't explain this movie to someone that hasn't seen it, you just need to see it for yourself.<br/><br/>Also, if you didn't already know this, this is the 3rd installment to a series.  Evil Dead and Evil Dead 2 are the first two installments, then Army Of Darkness.  You don't even need to see the first two to understand what's going on or anything like that.  In fact, to this day I still haven't seen Evil Dead.  When I watched Army of Darkness, I hadn't seen either Evil Dead or Evil Dead 2.  Since then, I have seen Evil Dead 2, but neither film is a prerequisite for this film.<br/><br/>Also this film has an enormous amount of quotable lines.  Bruce Campbell is THE MAN!  The way he says stuff is just great!<br/><br/>Well, I truly hope that you'll watch this movie.  But watch it with an open mind and remember that this IS a STUPID movie, but it's supposed to be. Thanks for reading,<br/><br/>-Chris"
"oneguyrambling","10","35","39","8 June 2011"," Look what Michael Bay can do with hundreds of millions and wonder why it isn't nearly this good.
","Evil Dead 3 goes by many different AKAs. <br/><br/>However even though the film is nearly 20 years old and was low budget even then it still holds up. It remains unbelievably quotable and helped make Bruce Campbell move from a B movie actor into a B Movie Star, and the director Sam Raimi a bona fide Hollywood big shot, I think the Spiderman films might've helped though <br/><br/>In the first 5 minutes Raimi effortlessly manages to catch us up on the first two films by showing the summarised backstory, only now including new scenes and events that featured Bridget Fonda as Ash's lady friend, and introducing his S-Mart career. Only a few details actually line up with the events of the first two films – which were in reality the same film made twice anyway – but who cares when the new elements are this fun? In short we rejoin Ash as he is dragged inexorably into another dimension by the forces of evil, ending up in an earlier time of (say) the 1200s, when men were men, demons were prevalent and a constant threat, and American people spoke with thick and contrived British accents – especially the extras.<br/><br/>Ash immediately finds himself stuck between two warring factions, the heavily armed castle fortress of Arthur and his men, and the (allegedly) vicious and desperate forces of Henry the Red – so named due to his amazing flaming mullet. Both sides believe the other are responsible for bringing the evil to wreak havoc on one and all.<br/><br/>After Ash hilariously proves that he is neither a ""Deadite"" nor a disciple of Henry the Red – and with his shotgun nor is he a man to be f*cked with – the local ""wise one"" declares him the ""One"" that has been foretold (look out Keanu, Eddie Murphy et al).<br/><br/>On hearing this and enjoying the subsequent grovelling and fawning that the desperate villages bestow upon him Ash reverts back to the wisecracking, self centred and cocky character that he gradually morphed into in ED2 – though it must be said that this attitude get ratcheted up a few notches with this film. If Evil Dead was a horror film with a few chuckles, and Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn was a horror-comedy, Evil Dead 3: Army of Darkness is a comedy-horror, with perhaps 75% laughs and 25% scares and gore. But even the scares are more funny and the gore is more played for laughs than gasps.<br/><br/>Ash heads off to find the magical Book of the Dead – the Necronomicon – which will banish the forces of evil and allow Ash to head back to his own time and minimum wage job. Of course his solo quest is destined to never run smoothly, and over the journey Ash must face and defeat a series of mini Ashes (in an amazingly creative Must-see scene), his evil doppelganger Evil Ash and his interred horde of undead minions who range from mere skeletons to more recently deceased zombie soldiers.<br/><br/>Along the way there is much over the top gore and action, some witty and incredibly arrogant dialogue, some ""Three Stooges"" homages and the extraordinary physical acting abilities of a young Bruce Campbell. He and Raimi are well acknowledged as longtime best friends, and they obviously had a ball making this film and threw everything but the kitchen sink into it amazing considering this is only an 80 odd minute film depending on which version you have. Raimi is well know for reveling in the on screen torture of pal Bruce so in the film Ash must perform some incredible ""backwards acting"", get attacked by flying and biting books, get attacked by underground bones and perform lengthy and intricate sword fighting combinations.<br/><br/>The evil dead soldiers are often shown in stop motion animation, and there are some shots that I would guess are either homages or were influenced by the work of Harryhausen. Perhaps if they made the same film today CGI might make it look prettier and make some of the actions of the undead a little less herky-jerky, but it wouldn't make the film any better. Every one of the apparently precious few dollars can be seen on screen, with the diminished budget demanding that the film-makers and crew simply had to be more creative than ever before.<br/><br/>Thankfully Raimi, Campbell and co were up to the task, the rough edges of Army of Darkness don't detract from the film at all, if anything they make it funnier. A scene in which one of Evil Ash's generals asks for orders and then rides off is hilarious when you look at the General's riding partner who is obviously little more than a skeleton shaped scarecrow, and the appearance of an unwitting crew member in the original version is another quirky and amusing oversight that enhances my enjoyment of this brilliant film.<br/><br/>The Evil Dead trilogy already represents some of the best examples, in horror, horror-comedy and simply comedy in cinematic history.<br/><br/>Not a bad effort for a few blokes with a miniscule budget and a few crazy ideas. After all look at what Michael Bay can do with hundreds of millions of dollars and ask yourself is that better? I'll break the suspense for you: Hell no it isn't! <br/><br/>Final Rating – 9.5 / 10. A brilliant conclusion to one of the better trilogies in cinema history. Ash will go down as one of the horror genre's defining characters.<br/><br/>P.S. I know a remake is slated for release next year, with a 0% chance of improvement on the originals why bother?"

","The third--and presumably last--of the Evil Dead movies finds Ash Williams(B-movie supreme ruler Bruce Campbell in full froth)somehow transported(along with his broken down car)in Medieval England,about to do battle,once again,with the undead,with the aid of(among other things) his ""boom stick"" and his chainsaw. While being a strange man in a strange land,he romances plucky lass Sheila(Embeth Davitz,pre-Schindler's List) and aiding the reluctant natives(among them Ian Abercrombie,MArcus Gilbert and Richard Groce).<br/><br/>To me(and I suspect I am not alone on this),one of the neat things about this film is that it moves at such a rip-roaring pace that one has little time to catch their breath or even add up the absurdity of the story. But,to quote another commenter,Who cares? This offering,which pretty much eschews the original Evil Dead's Horror premise,and capitalizes on more of the crazed,feverish pacing of Evil Dead 2,seems content to offer large doses of humor mixed with raucous violence and only the thinnest character exposition. Bully for director/co-writer Sam Raimi,co-writer Ivan Raimi and company on this! This is a great ""palate-cleanser"" of a movie and is a solid party film(among other occasions),whether you're fans of Campbell,Raimi,berserker action films,comedies or all four."
"Op_Prime","Null","89","107","2 June 2000"," Comedy and horror rolled into one
","Okay, maybe it's more comedy than horror, but who cares? Army of Darkness is an awesome movie. Bruce Campbell does an excellent job as Ash, the arrogant and hilarious hero armed with his trusty chainsaw and 'boom stick'. The plot was great and fresh, showing that the people behind the scenes were not trying to do the same thing that made Evil Dead I & II popular. The movie is filled with sword swinging skeletons, kick boxing witches and slap stick. Bruce Campbell has some excellent one liners. To sum it up, Army of Darkness is groovy.<br/><br/>But you can let it end here. Give us another sequel please."
"bob the moo","Null","87","108","25 July 2002"," Funny and cool!
","At the end of Evil Dead 2 Ash is sucked back in time through a time warp. He returns to medieval times where he is mistaken for the prophesied saviour.  He is sent to recover the lost Necronomicon to save the people but also return him to his own time.  Typically he makes a mistake when reading the book and he reserectes the army of the undead onto the land.  Ash must fight to defeat yet more undead fiends!<br/><br/>The third in the series sees the gore drop off and the comedy step up even more.  The previous two were both darkly funny but this is just plain hilarious.  The sheer raft of one liners and silly/horror set ups keeps you laughing all the way.  The horror is not scary as before  mainly because the gore is gone, however I prefer this as the stop motion stuff gives it an old fashioned feel that adds to the value of it  it's hard to explain but I really enjoy this because it feels like an old Harryhausen film.<br/><br/>Campbell is brilliant  I bet he can't believe hi s luck, the rest of his career he's struggled but Rami seem to love him.  And rightly so, he is like Jim Carrey but has so much more talent and is a classic B-movie leading man type.  The rest of the cast are so-so but really this is an one man show and he does it really well.<br/><br/>Overall this is a great little film.  Fans of the series will love it, fans of comedy should love it and fans of B-movie cheese should enjoy it.  And the less gore means fun for all the family (almost)."
"The-Sarkologist","10","15","16","26 January 2012"," This is the definition of a cult movie
","I simply love this movie. It is one of the classics in my opinion. It may not be that well known but when I first saw it I was captivated by the siege of the undead on the castle and loved it so much that I returned and saw it later at the cinema again. Now every so often I see it in the video store and go and hire it. When I recently hired it I noticed that they had released a directors cut with a different ending. Usually the director's cut is a little better that the original but I don't know with this one. I did like the original ending where he is back in S-Mart and blows away the witch that attacks him, grabs the girl, says ""hail to the king, Baby,"" and kisses her. It is such a cool image.<br/><br/>Army of Darkness is labelled as black comedy but I would also put it under the category of satire. What we are laughing at is not just death but also the arrogance of the average American redneck. The cover is that of a comic book movie and the shelf it was on at the local video library was ""Cult Movies"". I remember Evil Dead back when I was a kid. There was a computer game based on it and it was described as the most scariest film ever made. The trilogy originally began as a horror but I was told that when Evil Dead III came around, Raimi decided that the horror genre was so worn out it drifted into comedy.<br/><br/>Ash (Bruce Cambell) went on a retreat with his girlfriend and found the necronomicon, the evil book of the dead. The book killed his girlfriend and tried to possess him but he fought it off. The book struck back and dragged him into the past to medieval England where he is captured by the local lord with Henry the Red. He manages to redeem himself and goes on a quest to find the book to get him back to his own time but unfortunately he awakens the dead and they swarm the castle to get it back.<br/><br/>What makes this movie great is the individualist attitude of Ash. He is great because he has a gun and a chainsaw and nobody else does. He has attitude and basically acts like your everyday average rednecked American, and this stands out in the background of Medieval England. Unlike most time travel movies, he does not try to blend in, nor does he hide his technology. He simply shoves it in their face ""This is my BOOM stick!"" and says that if anybody gets in his way he will blow their brains out. Even though he has his boom stick, this does not stop the people from turning away from him when he reveals his individualistic streak. That is he awakens the dead and then wants to return home. No matter how great his boom stick is, the awe that they held in him is gone.<br/><br/>All I can say is that I love this movie. I will pay money for it for the simple pleasure of having it in my collection. It goes beyond a simple fantasy/Horror/Comedy movie to that of cult status. It is great and deserves that position on the video store shelf.<br/><br/>Favourite quote: I hate to burst your bubble but you are in charge of only two things, Jack and S**t, and Jack just left town."

","If you have seen the previous installments, the Evil Dead 1 and 2, you know what to expect from this movie. If you haven't, prepared to be shocked and impressed.<br/><br/>When I first saw Army of Darkness I had not seen the previous installments in the loosely called 'series'. I had no expectations, but right from the start of the film, it becomes clear that you are to relax, free your mind, and laugh as hard as you can.<br/><br/>Army of Darkness has no flaws in my opinion. It is perfectly paced and this is the role Bruce Campbell was born to play. The film sets a unique tone that not many movies can. It focuses more on comedy than gore unlike it's predecessors, but it works well in it's favor.<br/><br/>Once you watch it, you will have unlimited quotes to use with your friends. I still quote it to this day, and its been 20 years later. If you don't see this movie, you haven't lived life yet. Gimmie some sugar, baby."

I just happened to have a Blockbuster gift card and bought a pre-viewed ""Evil Dead"" and my mom had watched it with me. Strange, right? Well, because of her, I got to see one of the best movie trilogies of all time. Not to mention I couldn't believe the fan base these movies have. So it's good to know that I'm not alone.<br/><br/>Army of Darkness starts where Evil Dead 2 left off. Ashley has now gone back in time to the mid-evil times where he has to find a way back to his time. But the people he has met through this time think that he is the one who will save them all from the evil dead. They promise to help him find a way back if he saves them. Along that journey, he meets a beautiful peasant girl, Sheila, and they have a romantic affair. Along his journey to save the people, he must retrieve the ""Book of the Dead"", but when he slurs the words and does a half assed job of it, the book rises an evil twin of Ash's and leads his Army of Darkness to destroy the village Ash has promised to save.<br/><br/>This movie has great laughs and is a great end to this terrific trilogy.

"Maniac-9","10","16","18","27 January 2013"," Bruce Campbell in his prime
","Bruce Campbell is the absolute king of B Movies and in this movie he's in the absolute prime of his career. He's got such screen presence doing all the corny and off the wall jokes in what is the third movie of Sam Raimi's Evil Dead trilogy. The first movie was pretty much a straight up horror movie, then Evil Dead 2 while it still had a bit of true horror in it was very much a comedy film also, in Army of Darkness they go all out with the comedy. But the comedy is done tastefully and doesn't make the movie into a parody of the previous films like a lot of bad movies like Scary Movie do. Plus it doesn't hurt that they time travel back to medieval times instead of being a modern day cabin like the previous two movies were.<br/><br/>Embeth Davidtz plays the female lead who is normally known for much more boring movies like The English Patient and what not shines in a much different role for her. Even Bridget Fonda has a cameo at the beginning of the movie."

When Ash is thrown into a pit, he defeats two monsters and wins respect of Arthur's army and vassals. The Wiseman (Ian Abercrombie) points Ash as The Chosen One that will retrieve the Necronomicon but Ash is only interested in returning home. When he learns that the only way to return to his time is using the Necronomicon, Ash decides to travel to the unholy land of the Deadites. The Wiseman advises that he must say the words ""Klaatu Barada Nikto"" to safely get the evil book.

","The third time really is the charm, and ""Army of Darkness"" proves it incontrovertibly. This time, they just let the movie be what the first two movies were at heart: nice, silly, goofy, wacko, nonsensical fun. Just imagine the Three Stooges starring in a horror flick and you've got ""Army of Darkness"". The whole movie basically consists of Ash (Bruce Campbell) going after various evil spirits in the funniest way possible. And the quotes are some of the most hilarious quotes that you could ever imagine, probably mostly owing to how Bruce Campbell says them. Literally every scene is pure hilarity. Whether it's Ash showing his ""boomstick"", having trouble retrieving the book, battling mini-Ashes, or the big battle at the end, you never stop laughing yourself hoarse (I particularly liked some of the bone-related quotes). It doesn't even suffice to give this movie 10/10 stars. It deserves 100...no, a million...no, infinity out of 10 stars. Yeah, infinity out of 10 stars. Bruce Campbell not only deserves a star on the Walk of Fame, there needs to be a statue of him.<br/><br/>Oh, and an extra note. When I went to see ""Bubba Ho-Tep"" in the theater, Bruce Campbell was supposed to be there, but had to cancel. So, there was a short clip at the beginning showing him thanking us for coming, when his phone rang: ""Hello...Oh, hi Sam. Listen, I'll get to you in a minute."" (turns to audience) ""So thanks for coming to this movie."" (retrieves his phone) ""Yeah, Sam?...""Evil Dead 4""?! I'll do it!""<br/><br/>I just wonder how they would continue the story, now that Ash battled skeletons with his ""boomstick""."

","In the third installment of the Evil Dead Trilogy, our hero Ash is sent back in time to 1300 A.D. where he is enslaved and sent to the pit. After defeating the evil deadite that lingers in the depths of the pit, he is hailed as the chosen one. Ash, wants nothing to do with them and only wants to get back home, but the only way to do his is to retrieve the book of the dead. Unfortunately for Ash, he awakens the dead while taking the book, and now must battle the army of Darkness before he goes back to his own time.<br/><br/>Back in the year 1981, Sam Raimi and a group of friends created one of the most terrifying horror movies to date, The Evil Dead. Again in 1987 Raimi and Co. managed to create yet another genuine horror experience with Evil Dead II. Now with the third installment in this series, Raimi gives us a comedic cult classic film that will have you quoting every piece of dialogue in your every day life.<br/><br/>Army of Darkness is a perfect example of a cult classic. If you go walking down a street and ask if anyone has heard of it, they'll give you the crazy look. But search the net or go to any horror convention and you'll see that there are Evil Dead maniacs out there, and I am proud to say that I am one of them.<br/><br/>Most trilogies tend to suck by the third film, Blade trinity and revolutions to name a few, but here Darkness manages to make itself a stand alone film and a fine damn one at that. It still has it's nods to the original Evil Dead, but if you're looking for the ultimate horror experience, then this film is not for you. Instead Darkness is full of comedic dialogue and actions. Our hero ASH spits out classic one-liners that so many people try to copy today...I'm looking your way Duke Nukem.<br/><br/>Bruce Campbell is ASH. His character evolves throughout the trilogy and it's in this third installment that he is a badass. It's in this third installment that everyone remembers him from. It's in this third installment where he has the chainsaw, the boomstick, the one-liners, the sugar. Campbell will always be known for this one character. He's such a coward and yet we still feel the need to cheer him on. Campbell is the master of physical comedy and he uses it to his advantage here, fighting an army of mini ashs, splitting away from his evil self and getting his face sucked down an unknown demon hole from a book.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, that's what makes the film even more enjoyable. It's insane bizarre comedic tone. Whether you like slapstick comedy or have a dark funny bone, this film is delightful for all. I never thought I would laugh so much at someone pouring boiling hot water down their throat. Then to have the thing grow inside of you and try to detach itself from your body, only in a movie like this can you watch that and laugh with it. Granted, it would help if you've seen the first two films and in order as well. The opening does give you a recap of what's happened, but you feel more for the film and ASH if you've been through the horrors that he has.<br/><br/>Much like Peter Jackson got his start in the horror movie genre, so did Sam Raimi. You know, the guy that went on to direct such big hits as Spiderman and Spiderman 2. Army of Darkness has the little Sam Raimi touch with it. Once you see it you can tell that it's Raimi behind the lens. Raimi has his brothers scattered throughout the film, playing many different characters at that. As well as Three Stoogies get ups and the POV of certain objects, such as arrows being shot or forks being thrown.<br/><br/>The effects are great and still low key. You can tell which deadites are guys in suits and the black fabric behind the eyes of other skeletons, but that's what gives this film it's cheesy B movie goodness. Seeing ASH fight against all the evil mini ashs is a feat for the eyes as well, even if it does look so fake.<br/><br/>This is a great way to end the trilogy. I hope they do not make a fourth installment, as this is one of the greatest trilogies of all time, I'd even put it in the same sentence with Star Wars or Lord of the Rings, watch the Helm's Deep scene and tell me Jackson did not use army of Darkness as inspiration. I do not own all the DVD versions out there, which are a handful, but I do have the boomstick edition, so I'm able to enjoy the theatrical cut and the director's cut. Army of Darkness is a film that I can watch over and over and never get tired of, which is what a great fun movie should be."
"Pander18","9","15","19","13 August 2006"," The Most Unlikely Cultural Icon of a Movie Imaginable.
","Sam Raimi's Army of Darkness resides on a shelf alongside Metallica's ""Black"" album and Monty Python's Quest for the Holy Grail as required materials for 13 year-old males attempting to advance fully into puberty. Put simply, it must be watched and appreciated for male teens to fully grasp the nature of what it is to be a male teenager: cynical yet silly, horrific yet comedic, and filled with a bevy of violence and barbarism that only the middle ages and a K-Mart mock-up could provide.<br/><br/>For those who have forgotten or never had a 13 year-old male teenage-hood, this movie can easily fail as a juvenile exercise. Those who cannot find the magic in Bruce Campbell's every glance, be it menacing, moronic, or Moe Howard-esquire will not enjoy the larger part of this movie's outflowing slapstick and zingers. And of course, anyone looking for solid character development, plot, and a great catharsis beyond ""good guy blows up bad guys"" will run screaming in fear from this film. Despite it's pseudo-independent status, it clearly doesn't fit the 'indie film' paradigm of complex, deep characters dealing with universal problems. It deals with one oaf who happens to save humanity despite his best (and hilariously accidental) efforts to the contrary.<br/><br/>But the movie is not special only for its silly comedy. Sam Raimi, known most popularly nowadays for his work on the Spiderman series, showcases his signature style of cinematography in Army of Darkness, with unusual angles, quick-zooms, and stop-motion to create a style that is both off-settlingly jilting with the same type of jarring smoothness. The intro scene describes the book of the Necronomicon, with stop-motion animation showing words being inked into the book very jaggedly with a very scratching sound-set to compliment it. Yet at the same time it flows very fluidly, the words continuing to compile, and the scene playing out perfectly with the demonic setting. This style is perfect for the theme of the movie. His use of the steady-cam during a chase scene from the monster's point of view is admirable, as is his ability to super-impose the 'tiny' Ashes with the Big Ash as flawlessly as could have been done pre-CGI (well, except for the rather obvious ""Gulliver's Travel"" parody scene when they push closed his nostrils, which appears clearly bad).<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is the perfect melding of Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell's senses of humor and style. I think there may be no more funny facial expression in movies in the 90's than when Bad Ash suddenly is confronted with a shotgun to the nose, as Bruce Campbell's sudden bug-eyed expression drove me to howling peals the first time I saw that part. Their comic abilities create more than laughter though, they create a cultural landmark for those of us who were not quite generation X, nor generation Y, who sought identifiers as we aged. Much as generation X had the Breakfast Club, we have Army of Darkness, and for better or worse, it's helped produce a generation that mixes an admiration for both the clever and the absurd, and can understand that situations can be both frightening and funny.<br/><br/>P.S. This movie can also serve as a social barometer for friendship. If anyone does not laugh at ""This is my BOOM STICK"", you know you should not be their friend."

"mstomaso","10","12","15","16 October 2006"," Camp Horror Classic - Close to perfection.
","Army of Darkness is one of my all-time favorites. Bruce Campbell and Sam Raimi reinvent the Evil Dead series in this off-the-wall, tongue-in-cheek self-parody. Ash (Campbell) is transported to the European middle ages and must confront an army of deadites lead by his alter-ego ""Bad Ash"". Campbell's comedic acting is absolutely superb and the revamped Ashe character is an unforgettable hero and bumbler. In terms of entertainment value, AoD hits its mark perfectly - it redefines B film making by being self-consciously and intentionally hilarious. It is one of the most entertaining films in my collection.<br/><br/>The special effects are fun, but (and everything in this film is intentional) completely and overtly ""B-film"". Every aspect of the production works simultaneously toward building the story, the characters and humor.<br/><br/>There are many versions of this film available on DVD. If you enjoy any one of these, chances are you will enjoy the others. The only really major difference is between the theatrical release and the ""Bruce Campbell vs. Army of Darkness"" version - which, featuring a completely different and more consistent ending, is my personal favorite. If you like this film, chances are you will want to watch it repeatedly. The Vs version also has very entertaining commentary from Campbell and Sam and Ivan Raimi.<br/><br/>I am still hoping that the now wildly successful Sam Raimi will eventually revisit the Evil Dead series. Campbell is clearly interested in doing this, and the possibilities are certainly limitless."

","This frightening , strikingly designed horror/comedy movie achieved a lot of success thanks to its unstopped terror and humor , including continuous resemblances to the original version also directed by Sam Raimi . It deals with a 20th century guy , Ash (Bruce Campbell, first and last studio film he starred in as the lead) , none too bright hero , who finds himself trapped in the middle ages . As Ash along with his car , his shotgun, and his chainsaw is accidentally transported to 1300 A.D., there he finds the ¨Book of the Dead¨ in which unwittingly emerge resurrect demons . Soon he is discovered and thought to be a spy for a rival called Lord Arthur (Marcus Gilbert) and is taken prisoner . He is freed and confronts a nasty witch (Patricia Tallman) and Duke Henry the Red (Richard Grove) . Later on , square-jawed Ash must fight an army of ghouls and generally causes all those wreak havoc . Menwhile , he romances a babe , Sheila (Embeth Davidtz) , and attempts to retrieve the Necronomicon so he can return home . <br/><br/>A scary , tongue firmly in cheek sequel of the original festival of gore and gags in which an ancient book of magic , Necronomicon , invokes a crowd of joke-tossing , flesh-snacking skeletons . Exuberately gory and filled of guts flick , this is a big-budgeter film , while its predecessors were short-budget . This comic book extravaganza is blending from previous versions ¨Dead evil¨ with creepy creatures submitted a fantastic possession have transformed into flesh eating , being influenced by Ray Harryhausen's skeletons seen in ¨Jason and the Argonauts¨ and ¨Bedknobs and broomsticks¨ . As the entire sequence when Evil Ash grows out of Ash's shoulder starting with an eye is identical the 1959 b-movie 'The Manster' . Highly adequate make up and excellent special effect with enjoyable monstrous creatures and apparent technological exuberance . It must be stated that this is one of the grossest , disgusting and most brutally unnerving movies in the nineties . A fun retelling providing chills , hilarious situations and grisly horror and isn't apt for squeamish neither feeble stomachs . This independently produced gem features sets and production standards but is skillfully narrated and results to be an exciting horror/comedy film . Sympathetic acting by Bruce Campbell as hero hurled back to the 14th-century through the powers of an evil book and attempts to get back to his own time . Although Bruce Campbell was displeased with the studio's delayed release of the film and their re-editing of it , as he stated he wasted a year of his life waiting for the film to get released to cinemas . Thriilng as well as rousing musical score by Joseph LoDuca. Colorful and evocative cinematography by Bill Pope . <br/><br/>All 3 films can be seamlessly cut together , including some introductory footage in the follow-ups . The first installment was ¨Evil dead¨(1983) by Sam Raimi with Betsy Baker , Theresa Tilly and Bruce Campbell who finds ¨The Necronomicon¨, dealing with a group of friends are vacationing in Tennessee woods when go into a mountain cabin and they find the book of the dead , then begins a possession demoniac and they undergo an eerie changing at night and going on a murderous rampage . Followed by two sequels with similar actor (Bruce Campbell) , producer (Robert Tapert by Renaissance pictures) , musician (Joseph LoDuca) and well directed by Sam Raimi . As ¨Evil dead 2 , Dead by Dawn¨ (1987) in which young people again take refuge in an abandoned cabin and taking place subsequent transformation the students into evil monsters until only Ash remains to battle the evil . This ¨Army of darkness¨ was stunningly directed by Sam Raimi with great originality , though takes parts here and there , too . It's become a cult favorite thanks to its relentless terror , irony , graphic horror but has still tongue-in-cheek . Well worth watching for terror and gore lovers ."

"rob-hall-215-50887","Null","3","3","17 November 2011"," A (Chainsaw) Cut above the rest!
","Army of Darkness is Director Sam Raimi's final film in the excellent and bonkers Evil Dead Trilogy. Sometimes subtitled the Medieval dead, this third installment throws horror out of the cabin window and goes for full-on comedy slapstick antics instead! This is about as far removed from the original Evil Dead as any film could be, let alone a direct sequel. The film has the feel of an old adventure movie, or a Ray Harryhausen monster feature like Jason and the Argonautsor somethingwhat was the one with the skeletons?<br/><br/>The film begins (at the beginning) with another re-cap of the first two films, with the first film's sequences being re-filmed for a 'second' time (these scenes were recreated for use at the start of Evil Dead 2 due to copyright and studio ownership). These sequences feature Ash and a third, completely different Linda (this time played by Bridget Fonda, no less) being terrorized by the evil spirits, explaining how Ash lost his hand and ended up being sucked through time and spaceas you do (just watch the first two films and it'll make sensekind of). <br/><br/>We then cut to Ash (played by Bruce-I'm-the-best-actor-in-this-type-of-film-ever Campbell) narrating and filling us in on his current plight, learning that he has been mistaken for one of King Henry the Red's men, and is to be put to death in 'the pit'. Ash is thrown into this pit, which is shown to contain at least a couple of Deadites (zombies/ possessed people, seriously, watch the other films) which he must then fight, using his famous chainsaw hand! Ash is thrown the chainsaw by the helpful wise man and catches it neatly on the stump of his right hand, which is the point the audience is probably supposed to realize that this film really isn't going to be taking itself too seriously! After escaping, he confronts his captors, frees Henry and his men and is then hailed as the 'hero form the skies' mentioned at the end of Evil Dead 2. <br/><br/>One of the most notable changes in this installment is with the actual character of Ash. He has changed over the course of three films (and just two nights, in the timeline of the movies) from a shy, slightly geeky, barely capable college student, to a cocky, cynical, loud mouthed braggartwho's suddenly a shop assistant (""Shop smartshop S-Mart!"")! Ash learns he must then embark on a quest to find the Necronomicon, the 'book of the dead' featured throughout the other trilogy, which can not only dispel the evil but also send Ash back to his own time (""Plasticsmanufactured products""). Ash sets off after hastily creating a new fully functioning, seemingly 'air-pump powered' metal hand (good job we're not taking this film too seriously anymore) and 'getting it on' with his medieval love interest Sheila (""First you wanna' kill me, then you wanna' kiss me""). After riding for some time, he's chased into a deserted windmill by the ever present 'Evil Force' thingy. He then fights a group of mini Ash's (Don't ask) one of which ends up diving down his throat and growing out of him into a full sized 'Evil Ash', who pursues and torments our hero for the rest of the film! <br/><br/>After failing to recite the correct passages when retrieving the book, Ash inadvertently awakens the Army of Darkness, which basically consists of hundreds of cartoony skeleton puppets (the final assault on the castle is a little like an extended episode of the Muppets). This army, under the rule of Evil Ash and the recently possessed/ changed Sheila (Evil Sheila, I guess) is after the Necronomicon for reasons never really explained. The final, large scale battle ensues and Ash faces off against Evil Ash amidst the good and bad armies, the goodies having the edge as Ash uses the 'power of science' to make explosives etc in typical man-from-the-future-stuck-in-the-past style! <br/><br/>There are actually two different endings to the film, with the original (better) ending being seen as too bleak by the studio, who actually requested that Raimi film a more upbeat ending which was the one shown in cinemas (although if you purchase the two disc DVD it includes both 'good' and 'bad' endings). Overall then, this film is loads of childish fun and shamelessly ditches any pretense of horror in place of comic action and laughs, and works really well. It's not quite as good as the previous films, but it is enjoyable and has the same creative camera shots, clever one liners and frantic energy of the others and is a fine final finale to the series.finally!"

","''Army of Darkness '' is one of those horror movies that I consider to be more of a comedy with gory elements, then really a '' horror''.

Second because of the errors(like a Crew member or an equipment being visible in the movie)that are not edited, the cheesy skeletons and the primary effects of the movie. <br/><br/>The beginning and the end of the Evil Dead I,II, and Army of Darkness, almost doesn't match up as well, but the good thing is that you don't need to watch them in sequence to the plot make sense.<br/><br/>Our hero Ash, in this movie,is sucked into a time vortex with his Oldsmobile,into the England in AD 1300, where he is believed to be the ""Hero From The Sky,"" the man destined to deliver mankind to salvation from the ""Deadites,"" or the undead. To get into the future again, Ash needs to take the Necronomicon (book of the dead) and say the magical words ''Clatto Verata Nicto'', but our smart hero unleashes the forces of the Deadites,since he was unable to recall the precise magic words.

Army of Darkness picks up right were Evil Dead II left off Ash gets sucked into a portal teleporting him to the middle ages. The movie may not have horror in it but as a comedy it does great, its very funny with plenty of great laughs. In the movie Bruce Campbell's acting is still the same and Ash is still our lovable protagonist. The whole time there is many great and interesting cinematography and POV shots, a main staple of the series. Army of Darkness is missing one major thing: the gore is gone, I was very disappointed by this but after multiple viewings I've learned to live with it. The humor of the movie is set up like a three stooges skit with lots of slapstick jokes. One thing that sticks in my mind is the final battle between the kingdom and the army of the dead. It's fun and funny with plenty of Ray Harryhausen inspired effects. All the chips in play Army of Darkness is a way less serious movie, with lots of humor and many things (besides gore and horror) that made the first two movies great. Army of Darkness gets a 9 out of 10."

In AOD, you'll follow Ash on many a misadventure, as he is thrown into the Dark Ages and must quest for the Necronomicon. Army of Darkness is a great horror/comedy. So many scenes are standouts I can't just focus on one. You have to see this movie. It's one of the most thoroughly entertaining flicks ever. There's something in it for everyone, especially the B-horror buff. Its got action, adventure, romance, humor, and horror. Plus, it's got Bruce Campbell. The man is hilarious. It's worth buying just to see all of his facial expressions and hear all of his one-liners. Seek out this movie. And remember, ""Shop smart.

","...you're sorely mistaken.  AoD is a throwback (and a parody, much as Monty Python & The Holy Grail is ) of the big box-office epics of stuff like Excalibur.  The ""horror"" elements are basically relatively insignificant, and AoD effortlessly parodies fantasy action/adventure f;ocls by transposing a modern-day man into medieval times (much like A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court).  The first two Evil Deads are basically an excuse for this movie, so don't look for any real continuity either in plot or Ash's characterization.  You can see the seeds of Raimi's revisionist/historical Hercules/Xena here, whether in the non-existent nod to historical accuracy, or the goofy fight scenes."

It would have been better as a horror action with some comedy. This is very funny with one scare element and really is enjoyable but this enjoyment is aimed at a wider market and tragically suffers a little for it. A definite must for fans of the first two. Enjoy this classic early action from Sam Raimi - a precursor to Spider-Man? This is pure silliness and I love it!

","After beginning the Evil Dead series with a straight horror film, and then merging horror and comedy together in Part II. In Army of Darkness, it looks like Raimi's said ""To hell with it"" and just made the biggest, dumbest action/ comedy movie the $13 million budget allowed him to make.<br/><br/>In some foreign markets this was released with the awesome title ""Captain Supermarket."" That's because in this one Ash (Bruce Campbell) is a supermarket clerk who gets sucked back to medieval England to kick some undead ass. Corny one liners fly thick and fast, Campbell displays physical comedy that will have you in stitches. ""THIS IS MY BOOMSTICK!"" There are two different endings, both have their strengths and weaknesses.<br/><br/>If you were paying attention in Evil Dead 2, you would have noticed a scene where they are looking the Book of the Dead and see an ancient story about a knight in medieval England who stopped the dead. ""Didn't do a good job,"" quips Ash. Well the knight is him. And he actually causes the problems with the undead in the first place due to his half baked attitude toward duty. There are shenanigans to be had with fighting bones, Ash getting an evil alter ego, and an all out battle for the human race between medieval knights and undead zombies plays out like a small budget Robin Hood vs the Zombies film.<br/><br/>There actually is a nice supporting cast in this too, including Embeth Davidtz. Marcus Gilbert, Ian Ambercrombie and a young Bridget Fonda (hardly in it at all). But this is Campbell's film. He's not quite as unrestrained as in the insane second part, but he certainly does ""Let it Go"" in this one too. The scene at the windmill is three stooges stuff, but is great. <br/><br/>You'll laugh, you'll roll your eyes at some effects and one liners, but ultimately you'll be really entertained by this over the top action comedy that doesn't take itself very seriously at all."

","After Ash (Bruce Campbell) was sucked into a vortex and sent back to the medieval age at the end of Evil Dead 2, he now must go on a quest for the Book of the Dead in order to be returned to his own time. In doing so, he accidentally resurrects an army of living skeletons led by his evil undead twin! Lots of carnage and laughs ensue as the shotgun toting, chainsaw armed hero must now battle these monstrous forces with his 20th century tactics and deliver mankind from an ancient evil! <br/><br/>This highly entertaining third installment in the awesome Evil Dead series takes a completely different direction than it's two predecessors. Whereas the first two films were strictly horror (though there were many humorous moments in part 2), this film is a straight up action comedy with Three Stooges type gags and filled with slapstick humor. I love how much the protagonist Ash has evolved in the course of three films. In the first movie, he was quite an introverted coward but is now a wisecracking, one liner spitting action hero. He also happens to be my favorite movie character of all time. Bruce Campbell is the man! This is his movie, and he shines throughout every scene he's in. This movie comes highly recommended if you're a fan of hilarious and action packed horror comedies. I know I am!"

","It's not good as ""Evil Dead 2"" but it's still a fun humorous wacky movie with a bit of horror(well when it comes to the surroundings anyways). This doesn't really have that scare factor compared to the first two, but instead it brings out the crazy, humorous and wacky elements way more this time around. And it takes place in the Medieval Ages I think. Even though this one doesn't really have much to do with the previous installments it's still has that flare going for it. sure it's one of those movies that is the epitome of just going with the flow. Because a lot of it is random or doesn't make much sense. But if you can just go with it, you can enjoy this. What really drives this movie though is Bruce Campbell reprising his role as Ash. His goofy, silly and wackiness while also being a badass brings a lot to this movie. And gives a incentive to root for his side. Although it can be cheesy at times it's still a very fast-paced and entertaining film. Overall it's a ridiculous movie that is so good.<br/><br/>7.9/10"

","I know that people love this movie but allow me to speak some truth. The truth is that Ash has about as much appeal as reusable toilet paper. Ash is just an ashhole. Yes, I said it! An epic chin and epic appendage does not a hero make. When a girl makes a blanket for him, he doesn't even say thanks. He's a loud-mouthed braggard with a boomstick and he deserves every bit of beating he gets from his mini-me parasites. And btw, there's nothing funny about Badash singing little goody two shoes. But let's talk about the plot. Things take a turn for the worse for Ash when life sucks him back to the medieval era of primitive screwheads who capture him and throw him into a blood-spewing hole of wicked back flippers and growling ghouls. Luckily he and his chainsaw arm make it out alive and the adventure continues. Dare I say the only part of this movie that is truly unmissable is the final battle between the living and the dead. And holy Harryhausen is it a visual feast! You see, long before Viggo, Lego and Dwarf summoned an army of dead to fight Mordor, there was another morbid mass of muertas who had a bone to pick. Bonepipers lead the way and a skeleewag plays a femur flute as the Deadite army close in on the castle. What follows is a mix bag of mayhem that will make you smile.

Some creepy-looking monsters but this is a Actioncomedy Adventure in the lands of evil. The chemistry with clashes between time-cultures are one of the funniest there is.

Also, it's hilarious. <br/><br/>But really, it's the movie I think of when I think Bruce Campbell. The chainsaw hand, the boomstick, the gags. This is Bruce's finely-tuned b-movie persona.

","Sam Raimi is probably my favorite horror filmmaker. The excitement and over-the-top humor he brings to his horror films is just so wickedly entertaining. Army of Darkness was funnier than the first two Evil Dead films, and had a lot more comedy. It was a slam bang from the opening scene, and a perfect ending to this amazing trilogy. Bruce Campbell shows that he is the man and now on the list of my favorite movie heroes. Sam Raimi knows how to make the perfect horror/comedy and he does not fail to deliver yet again a horror film that is perhaps funnier than most comedies out there. All in all, another spectacular entry into this trilogy, and I think even better than Evil Dead 2 and on par with the first for different reasons."

","If they'd put Sam Raimi in charge of the banks there wouldn't be any recession, because what he manages to do with a small budget is absolutely remarkable. Charm and good humour seep from every frame of this glorious film, a pitch-perfect mix of action, humour and horror that beats the crap out of the pretentious, overblown Lord of the Rings trilogy in my book.<br/><br/>Watching it again for the first time in about ten years, what is immediately striking about Bruce Campbell's performance is the sheer energy he gives it. Plenty of the fight scenes consist of one long shot where he is running, jumping and doing backward rolls (!) as he indulges in swordplay with the Deadites - a wonderful Harryhausen tribute that plays out as a loving homage rather than a cheeky steal. For my money the 'store ending' provides a far better ending to the trilogy than the downbeat, 'future' one, the immortal line ""hail to the king baby"" being one final, punch-the-air moment in a movie full of them.<br/><br/>Three cheers for everyone involved in this triumph!

","The whole Evil Dead trilogy is honestly one of the luckiest trilogies to ever be created, mainly because all three movies have been successes. This is not entitled Evil Dead III, but instead as Army of Darkness. This really picks up though where Evil Dead II left off, in which Ash lands back in time and must defend a middle age civilization. This is a lot more of a basic comedy/horror, in which Evil Dead I and II were both out for the horror.

"Samiam3","8","3","4","29 May 2009"," Ha Ha Horror, very good
","To summarize. a little more plot, and tongue-in-cheek humor (or in this case, out of cheek), makes Army of Darkness not only the best in Sam Raimi's series, but one of the best comedic horrors. With the first Evil Dead, the gore got too distracting, with the second, the humor was fine but there was practically no plot. Army of Darkness balances all the elements just right. It offers goofy fun, and a satisfactory form of closure to the series.<br/><br/>We pick up from where we left off in Evil Dead II. Ash has been transported back to Medieval Europe. In the course of eighty quirky minutes he goes from being one of King Arthur's chained slaves to the leader of his army. According to the prophecy of the book of the dead, he is destined to save mankind from the army of darkness. Which he does, before getting transported home.<br/><br/>I actually found myself laughing aloud quite frequently, and with the possible exception of 'Lake Placid', I don't think any horror movie has done that to me. Even from the opening shot, which is comical, you know right away that this is going to be a fun movie. This is Sam Raimi at his best. Enjoy."

Ain't that an awesome thing to watch? Well, EVIL DEAD is past, ARMY OF DARKNESS is the subject under discussion. And damn, of all three movies about the eternal unlucky fellow Ash, who always reminds me of full-time victim of life Al Bundy, I like ARMY OR DARKNESS the best.

You must have issues if you don't laugh when you see that.<br/><br/>In the end, it's a comedy but a truly original one. Bruce Campell is just the man for this role and he is one great actor.

Clearly intended as the ""Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court"" of B-movies, what's surprising is how successful it is in accomplishing this.

It's both simple and direct, but clever and witty; this makes it work on a number of levels, which most films of this type cannot even aspire to.<br/><br/>As for Bruce Cambell - he not only turns in a great performance, but does so playing a regular guy who happens to get smart and courageous when he has to - a real hero for an unheroic age."

Bruce Campbell has all the fun as he performs Three Stooges routines, goes a little Gulliver, romances a babe, and kills his evil self twice. The battle of Oldsmobile is the highlight as Ash takes on an army mixed of Ray Harryhausen skeletons and KNB zombies. The voices, the sliding dagger skeletons, and the hi ho hi ya make the battle super cool.

Of course, there are some... complications in his quest.<br/><br/>'Army of Darkness' takes the 'Evil Dead' series in a whole new direction. The horror and gore is gone, replaced by comedy and fantasy. Some other reviewers have already hinted to the best way to describe this movie: Campy b-movie inspired by older fantasy movies ('Jason and the Argonauts' in particular'). If you enjoyed the first two 'Evil Dead' movies, don't expect much of the same style in 'Army of Darkness' - the 'Evil Dead' style is all but gone. Except for Ash. Ash is King.<br/><br/>However, there is nothing to be disappointed about. 'Army of Darkness' is a very funny movie.

I won't give away the movie's plot but Ash royally screws up in a very funny scene in a graveyard and ends up raising an army of darkness which he must help the locals fight off. Bruce Campbell is one of the finest actors on the planet and here he is no exception. While quite possibly it is the weakest of the Evil Dead trilogy it is an awesome movie that nearly anyone would enjoy on a Saturday afternoon. You could do worse with a spare 90 minutes. Recommended to anyone who likes B movies, horror movies, fantasy movies, or comedies."

","Army of darkness looks and feels like a cheap B-movie knockoff of a horror movie. That's because it tries to. The three stooges-esque humor combined with a medieval setting, a very egotistical hero with a chainsaw (that runs w/o gas!) attached to one arm and a shotgun (doesn't need to be cocked or reloaded!) in his good hand, and of course, the evil ARMY OF DARKNESS makes one heck of a spoof of the horror/ slasher genre.

","There's no in between with this movie.  No one ever says, ""Well, it's okay."" It takes a certain sense of humor to enjoy this movie, which is why it bombed at the box office, but has since earned itself a massive cult following.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this movie, it's basically a retelling of 'A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court.'  To leave it at that, however, is to miss the point.  Like the previous installments of the 'Evil Dead' series, this one has copious amounts of gore, but it takes the sense of humor presented in the second film and runs with it.  The result is sort of a bloody, live-action cartoon which pays tribute to the old adventure films of times past (similarities to 'Jason and the Argonauts' should be fairly obvious).<br/><br/>In the hands of less talented individuals, this horror/comedy/adventure combination would surely have been a disaster, but Sam Raimi's off-the-wall script and stylish direction combined with Bruce Campbell's amazing performance as Ash, make this one of the funniest movies ever made.<br/><br/>This is without a doubt one of the most entertaining films ever, packed with enough jokes and one-liners to strangle a horse.<br/><br/>See this movie.

Ash needs the book to get back to his time so they team up to try and win the battle.<br/><br/>Sam Raimi's third film from THE EVIL DEAD trilogy is without question my least favorite of the series and I honestly just don't find it as funny as I'm sure everyone intended. The movie was obviously meant to be a cross between a Three Stooge film and a Ray Harryhausen film and there's no doubt that Raimi keeps the mood light and fast moving.<br/><br/>If you're coming into this expecting something like the first two films then you'll certainly be disappointed because this goes off in its own direction, which was a pretty brave thing to do. After all, when you're going into a sequel you just expect to see the same thing as before. This probably explains why the film didn't do too well at the box office but it eventually found a cult following.<br/><br/>Raimi certainly keeps the film moving at a nice pace and of course there's Campbell returning as Ash. It goes without saying but Campbell is what keeps this movie going with his zany and comic performance. He manages to milk out all sorts of entertainment and is there anyone better for this campy lines that he has to deliver here? ARMY OF DARKNESS is a nice throwback to the Harryhausen films but I still think it's the weakest of the series. I'd argue that the Director's Cut is certainly the version to go with as it contains the better ending and doesn't feel as rushed."
"gigan-92","9","4","6","3 January 2011"," 3rd Installment Kicks Ass!!
","A+ I now own all three Evil Dead movies, and this film is must see by me. Released in 1992, this film still hits incredibly hard on several aspects, including cinematography, comedic elements, and an imaginative and original story as well as adventurous action. Sam Raimi even delivers a good many scares and a few grisly shots, but maybe not enough gore for some fans' taste. Still, Bruce Campbell returns so all is forgiven in my book. I'll say right now that I wholeheartedly prefer the Director's cut, and especially the alternate (original) ending. More material, more fun to put in short.<br/><br/>The cast is pretty decent, as is the story which moves briskly and never drags. Not only that, it was incredibly funny through I must say; Ash delivers his dialogue crisply, and as a plus, Raimi relies on mostly raw effects, including good old stop motion. This fits the film perfectly as I've quickly grown tired of CGI with each film now-a-days, especially in the horror genre where I've always felt CGI did not belong. The end battle is priceless, with the wise-cracking army of the undead led by Evil Ash himself, awesome! The sets are great, the shots are intense and always a pleasure. And the icing on the cake, Joseph Do Luca returns a final time for the marvelous score and this is classic amongst garbage."

In it, Bruce Campbell plays Ash, a man whose girlfriend is killed by demons and zombies in the backwoods, a man forced to fight the undead with his chain saw and gun. Bruce Campbell reprises his role as Ash for this film. Ash tells his fellow supermarket co-workers that he had traveled in time to the Middle Ages and had the chance to become king. A kingdom is in trouble as an army of the undead is forming. Ash is suddenly whisked away to this medieval world, equipped only with his car, his chain saw and gun. Before long, he becomes the kingdom's only hope for salvation from the demonic forces. His mission is to read from a book of the dead and recite the magic words. But there's a problem. He forgets the last word. The consequences are dire. An army of skeletons and demons begin to attack the kingdom. The premise to this film, if handled as less of a comedy, would be pure adventure-horror and fantasy. But as it is, this film is more of a dark comedy filled with computer-enhanced visual effects, this coming at a time at the beginning of the 1990's when such devices for film-making were very new. To some, this film is B movie hell. To others, this film is a feel-good film, a comedy dressed up as horror and adventure. Bruce Campbell, whose career owed to Sam Raimi, is doing his usual thing - slapstick comedy, physical comedy, witty comic lines. He is a sort of comic swashbuckler and this would be his most famed identity as an actor. He would later appear in television's ""Xena Warrior Princess"" as the King of Thieves, and more recently in the ""Spider Man"" films which were also directed by Sam Raimi. Coincidentally, Joseph LoDuca provides the music for this film, and he would work with Sam Raimi again for other films and also on Xena. The film is probably nothing terrific, and is really more of a comedy for grown-ups but it's enjoyable nonetheless. It's a horror film that doesn't take itself too seriously. It's a refreshing stray from the traditional zombie films. However, perhaps due to some of the language and mild violence, this film is more appropriate for pre-teens (13 and up)but not for young and sensitive children. An entertaining, hilarious horror film for an acquired taste in Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell."

That creepy kid down at the comic book store who just sits there all day dressed in black starring at the odd brown spot on the ceiling likes it. Why is that? The secret behind Army of Darkness isn't that its a sequel to the Evil Dead movies, nor is it because Bruce Campbell is super sexy or Sam Raimi is the greatest director ever (I'd say third greatest).<br/><br/>I think the the appeal of the movie comes from the sheer enthusiasm displayed throughout the picture. Every frame of this movie reeks with pure undiluted fun, transferred from the actors and director straight into your seat. They take all the badassery they could muster and inject it into the movie, right through the eye.<br/><br/>Army of Darkness doesn't have state of the art effects, nor an entirely coherent plot. It isn't a horror story, nor a medieval epic.

"poolandrews","4","7","15","14 February 2009"," Disappointing third Evil Dead film.
","Army of Darkness starts where Evil Dead II (1987) finishes with Ash (Bruce Campbell) finding himself stranded in the thirteenth century after he was transported back in time, there he is mistaken for an enemy warrior by Lord Arthur (Marcus Gilbert) & his men & taken prisoner. Back at Lord Arthur's castle Ash learns that unspeakable evils are terrorising Lord Arthur's people, in order to get back to the twentieth century & to rid the land of the evil Deadites Ash must undertake a quest to find the Necronomicon, or the Book of the Dead as Ash know's it. Ash has to go it alone as he faces trouble from the evil dead & the book itself along the way as he tries to get back home...<br/><br/>Co-edited, co-written & directed by Sam Raimi this is the third film in his Evil Dead franchise, also known under the title Army of Darkness: The Medieval Dead & shot under the working title of Evil Dead 3 the actual Evil Dead title apparently wasn't eventually able to be used due to copyright & legal problems caused by the collapse of the De Laurentiis Entertainment Group who financed Evil Dead II & co-produced this while it was still in business. To be honest with a distinct change in title there's a distinct change in tone as well since Army of Darkness simply didn't feel like an Evil Dead film to me or at least what I felt an Evild Dead film should feel like. While the first two Evil Dead films were classic black comedy horror films with with lots of gore Army of Darkness tones the gore & horror down to virtually nothing & instead ups the slapstick comedy & visual gags to an almost unbearable level & as such Army of Darkness feels more like a Three Stooges (writer & director Raimi has often stated The Three Stooges were a major influence on him) outing featuring a few monsters. To be fair the film is quite likable & there are a few moments which might make some laugh but for me there were far more misses than hits in the joke & gags department & I really miss the horror & gore of the previous Evil Dead films. The films plot is also very poor when analyzed, Ash's quest doesn't seem that difficult & why didn't either Lord Arthur & his men or the Deadites retrieve the Necronomicon already? If they knew where the book was & how to safely get why didn't they? Why did they need to send Ash? Why didn't the bad guy's grab it already? The romance between Ash & Sheila feels pointless & why did they change the start & make it different to the end of Evil Dead II where Ash shoots that flying monster?<br/><br/>Confusingly Army of Darkness surely must be a contender for the film with the most alternate versions, there are theatrical cuts, TV versions, director's cuts all containing/missing/adding/removing unique material & to add to the confusion there's two different endings which seem to get used almost at random depending where you live. To be honest the differences are purely cosmetic, there's no change of story between most of the different version apart from the ending which is substantially altered. Most of the deleted/added scenes are just extension's of existing sequences or minor added scenes that don't affect the story too much. While I didn't find Army of darkness funny or particularly clever I was also disappointed with it's very overblown jovial atmosphere as opposed to the intense horror & gore of the previous Evil Dead films, to be honest there's no horror or gore here to speak of & this would surely rate as a 'PG' these days. Made at a time before CGI computer effects most of the ambitious effects sequences are achieved through matte paintings, composites & stop-motion animation. The stop-motion animated skeletons remind heavily of Ray Harryhausen's brilliant sequence from Jason and the Argonauts (1963) also featuring skeletons. The film has a fun visual style with Raimi using all sorts of camera tricks & editing techniques.<br/><br/>With a supposed $11,000,000 budget Army of darkness was by far the biggest budgeted Evil Dead film to date & Raimi uses the money to create an all out war film set in a medieval fantasy setting culminating in an epic battle between good & evil. The film bombed at the box-office & it's not difficult to see why to be honest. The acting is alright, Bruce Campbell has screen presence & is likable in this as he delivers the one-liners with aplomb while Bridget Fonda has a small role at the start.<br/><br/>Army of Darkness is occasionally fun & it certainly moves along like a rocket with barely a dull moment but somehow it just didn't do it for me, I didn't find it that funny & I really missed the intense horror, monsters, slime & gore of the previous films. Wathable but very silly & not entirely satisfying. According to the IMDb another sequel titled Evil Dead IV (2011) is currently in development."

","Only having three titles by Dario Argento left to see (I ended up picking Phantom of the Opera,which apart from the continuing of a few themes was a missed opportunity for Dario) I decided to go for another movie to watch as a double bill on my 31st birthday. Receiving the complete set from very kind fellow IMDber Red-Barracuda,I decided that it was the perfect time to see the evil dead rise again.<br/><br/>View on the film:<br/><br/>Revving back to life after a five year gap, co-writer/(with brother Ivan) director Sam Rami & The Matrix cinematographer Bill Pope transfer the free-flowing ultra-stylisation of the first two onto a much larger canvas,with the extended,rapid-fire tracking shots of the first films morphing into explosive battle scenes that spin flying first-person shots across the sky towards their targets. Taking the series in a more open Fantasy/Ray Harryhausen-inspired direction,Rami tones down the gory horror shocks for playful Slap-Stick Horror (!) that ties Ash into Gulliver's Travels,and the Medieval setting allowing Rami to use Harryhausen-style stop-motion animation to bring an army of darkness back from the evil dead.<br/><br/>
Sending Ash's 1973 Oldsmobile Delta 88 into Medieval times, the screenplay by the Rami's chop their lone hero into a fish out of water adventure,where Ash's off the cuff one-liners leads to very funny gruff exchanges with the knights. Whilst less focused on the horror element,the writers do well twisting the Adventure tale into the Horror genre,as Ash is sent as a man on a mission to retrieve The Book of the Dead,and a surprising dip into Sci-Fi ends the trilogy on an excellent chilling note. Picking up the chainsaw again, Bruce Campbell gives a hyper-active performance as Ash,who leaps into action to take on the evil dead's army of darkness."

","When I first watched this, I had no idea it was part of a series. It's been over 10 years since then and I have re-watched this (after watching Evil Dead 1 & 2) and it still very much holds up. As part 2 did, this invents a totally different back-story to support the new direction this is going. While part 2 also hinted on the funnier side of horror, this almost goes completely overboard with it! And it also shows Sam Raimis love for ""The Day the Earth stood still"" (the original that is, not the awful Keanu Reeves remake).<br/><br/>The movie had it tough though and Sam had to shoot a different ending than he intended. I actually like both endings (should be on the disc you're about to buy/rent), but I did watch the commercial/producers request one first. I might tend to like that one more because it seems to come full circle. Whatever your feelings are, this is funny and I can only hope an Army of Darkness 2 entry here on IMDb (even for 2016) proves to be legit (we've been waiting for so long now)!"

","This movie is part of the Evil Dead series of films directed by Sam Raimi. There is Evil Dead 1 and 2, followed by Army of Darkness. However you can watch Army of Darkness without having seen the first 2 movies, it's pretty independent from its predecessors. If you've seen Evil Dead, don't expect the same tonality from this movie, it's a whole different style. This is a funny horror movie with lots of hilarious situations and Jim Carrie style of acting (in fact I think Jim Carrey got his inspiration from Bruce Campbell). There are awesome lines that remind me a lot of Terminator and the action could be described as ""Terminator at the court of King Arthur"". The movie does not take itself seriously, the actors and director clearly enjoyed filming it, and there is a very laid back and relaxed feeling transmitted throughout. I laughed my head off and it's great to watch with friends. 7/10"

","It was a rainy night of November. Outside the wind was screaming at the trees, the rain poured violently and there were no moon. I was 10 years old and I was about to see one of the Greatest Film Ever Made. Alone in front of the TV I watched Ash being punched, chased by an ancient evil, fighting demons and giving ""some sugar to a babe"". What a wonderful world of magic, monsters, legends, superstitions, brave men and ugly monsters! Whitout ever meeting with Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell, I wanted to be their friend: they created a piece of art that would make me dream for years. I want more of Bruce and Sam. I have watched the previous Evil Dead, and, although it is very, Very, Good, I still prefer Ash and the atmosphere of the middle ages. The ""Army of Darkness"" is the coolest movie on Earth and around, and the music (Danny Elfman) is magnificent."

"jayjaycee","8","2","3","4 November 2019"," Sir Ash, Lord of the medieval madness
","""Army Of Darkness"" is a 1993 horror comedy directed by Sam Raimi starring Bruce Campbell and Embeth Davidtz. The final chapter of Raimi's ""Evil Dead"" trilogy is the most overexcited of them all. While the shift from splatter horror to horror comedy sounds weird, but is still imaginable, the idea that the third outing is a medieval fantasy comedy is absolutely overwhelming. Centered around our chainsaw and shotgun wielding anti-hero, Ash Williams, the whole plot takes place in 1300 A.D. - and as messed up as it sounds - it's absolute fun from start to finish. The premise might sound tremendously ludicrous, but the execution managed to be ludicrous in a good way . It has a cheap but adorable charme to it. Mostly thanks to the crafty dialogue and absurd humour of the Raimi brothers the odd atmosphere comes to life. Next to exaggerated slapstick stunts (that pay an homage to the Stooges!) and hilarious, but well crafted visual effects, it even offers a decent story with extreme absurdity and ridiculous comedy gold. Let's not forget to mention the score, especially the theme of the army itself. Some scenes are too ridiculous even for my taste, but it's the style of the film that fills me with vast infantile joy. The final battle, with all its pompousness and impressive stop-motion effects, feels weirdly epic in its own unique way. It appeals to the inner child in all of us and it doesn't want to achieve anything more. All in all, this film is a treat for hardcore fans of the predecessors. It's stylish, weird and absurd from start to finish and if you can embrace the medieval madness you'll enjoy it as I did it. It's not everybody's darling, but a groovy end of an iconic horror franchise."
"shakercoola","6","2","3","13 October 2018"," A fuller story with all of the Evil Dead DNA that made it memorable
","There was never enough in The Evil Dead to credit it with being the best film just because the cabin-in-the-woods theme was an original one. The film was below par in too many aspects and it was not much of a story, and not the first to feature flesh-eating demons. And, although the second instalment was entertaining and creditable, the third in the series proves the point that there is no substitute for a good story and high production values. Evil Dead III: Army of Darkness is funny, well acted, consistent pacing throughout, and raises the bar once more and still retains all of the familiar DNA in gore, slapstick humour and good all round entertainment. Containing less of the blood soaked insanity of the previous two instalments, Army of Darkness is more of a cartoonish sword-and-sorcery fantasy, albeit one with some imaginative monsters and special effects, with a horror element attached to it."
"paul_haakonsen","8","2","3","10 January 2016"," A fabulous movie...
","A direct continuation of ""Evil Dead II"", this 1992 movie ""Army of Darkness"" continues in the same manner of comedy, blood and pure wicked entertainment. It is a movie that can be watched again and again, just like the previous two movies.<br/><br/>The story picks up exactly where ""Evil Dead II"" ended, with Ash having been sucked through a vortex and having ended up in the Medieval Ages around 1300 AD, where he must retrieve the dreaded Necronomicon if he is to return home to his own time and world. But there are dark forces hungering for the Necronomicon.<br/><br/>Chances are very slim that you will not like this movie, or at least I think so. I like the comedy in this movie a lot and the absurdity of it all.<br/><br/>While the effects are outdated, of course, by todays standards, then it is still fun to Watch and works well enough for what it is. And the effects will have you laughing more often than not.<br/><br/>Bruce Campbell is, of course, nothing short of phenomenal in the role of Ash, and he is so right for the role. He delivers the dialogue, punchlines and one-liners with his usual charms and good looks.<br/><br/>""Army of Darkness"" is a classic in its own rights, and it is one that I will watch again and again, as I have done since the 1990's. It scores an instant eight out of ten stars from me, without a doubt. All that is left to say is: hail to the king, baby!"
"jfgibson73","8","2","3","7 January 2016"," Listen up, screwheads
","I'll say first off that this is an uneven movie, meaning that there are some great high points, and then some dips into long, inexplicable sequences that don't seem to match with the rest. The movie follows Ash, a hilariously flawed character, fumbling his way through a fish out of water story. He's sent back into medieval times and has to help some knights defeat an evil undead army. Granted, he basically unleashes the threat himself and tries his best to slip away without cleaning up his own mess, but that's Ash 101. He makes time to romance the women, of course, and if they beg him to stay, he lets them know all those promises he made were ""just pillow talk, baby."" Lots of great lines and a sense of fun all the way through. I don't think I would call the humor ironic, but it's not entirely straightforward either. I'm glad they made the TV series, but I'm still hoping for another movie."
"skybrick736","8","2","3","30 November 2015"," Army of Darkness (8/10)
","The hilarious performance by Bruce Campbell in Army of Darkness has got to be the reason for his massive cult following. His one-liners are so off the wall and quotable that replay value will always be existent with this film. Army of Darkness, unlike the previous Evil Dead movies went light on horror substance and built itself around Ash and a plot that is seemingly close to the book, Lord of the Rings: Two Towers (since the movie wasn't out yet). However, there are so many memorable scenes that the flick really stands out on its own even with the insane amount of parodying the film took. In my opinion, Army of Darkness is the best in the trilogy and should be accepted in the comedy genre just as much as it is in the horror genre."
"Hey_Sweden","8","2","3","29 November 2015"," ""Good, bad. I'm the guy with the gun.""
","Briefly recapping the previous films in the ""Evil Dead"" franchise, ""Army of Darkness"" then picks up as the poor, bedeviled Ash (Bruce Campbell) is magically transported back to 1300 A.D. and the days of Lord Arthur (Marcus Gilbert). He learns that in order to get back to his original time and place, he must once again lay his hands on that damned book known as the Necronomicon. His evolution into obnoxious moron now complete, Ash is so dense that he can only remember two of the three words that he needs to utter before removing the book from its resting place. In so doing, he resurrects an army of skeletal warriors (a nice nod to ""Jason and the Argonauts"") that will be led by an evil version of himself.<br/><br/>Some fans of the previous movies simply don't care for this entry, largely because it's much too comedic and silly, not to mention light on true horror, for their tastes. But this viewer has always loved it, because it seems that co-writer / director Sam Raimi (who penned the script with his brother Ivan) was having so much fun. ""Army of Darkness"" is basically a spoof of the entire medieval fantasy genre, and it has some great gags, in addition to some highly quotable dialogue. (""Gimme some sugar, baby."") The studly Campbell shows off plenty of comedy chops in the leading role, who through the course of the story finally becomes a genuine hero. Production design (by Tony Tremblay) and cinematography (by Bill Pope) are wonderfully atmospheric, and the effects, for the most part, are delightfully done. Past Raimi collaborator Joseph LoDuca composes most of the music, with Danny Elfman supplying a rousing new ""March of the Dead"" theme.<br/><br/>Campbell is nicely supported by the lovely Embeth Davidtz as leading lady Sheila, Ian Abercrombie as the old wise man, and Richard Grove as Arthurs' human nemesis Duke Henry the Red. ""Evil Dead"" fan Bridget Fonda has a cameo as Linda; also doing the cameo thing are Patricia Tallman as the gnarly possessed witch, and Raimis' actor brother Ted (in a few roles). Bill Moseley plays a Deadite captain.<br/><br/>Among the highlights: Ash being tortured by miniature versions of himself, his duels with Evil Ash, and the final raid on Arthurs' castle & compound.<br/><br/>Eight out of 10."

Breezing by at less than ninety minutes, it's a wickedly entertaining genre mash-up that's an homage and wholly original at the same time.<br/><br/>But standing chin and shoulders above it all is the one and only Bruce Campbell. His Ash Williams is one of the all-time great movie characters. Meeting danger with a combination of bravery and stupidity, he quips his way through it all and saves the day.<br/><br/>featuring a much different tone and type of story than its predecessors, 'Army of Darkness' stands on its own as a true original and, dare I say it, classic."

","Still trapped in the medieval assault, Ash leads the fight against the awakened Deadite army looking to retrieve the captured Necronomicon he needs to return back to his present time.<br/><br/>Overall there's not a whole lot really wrong with this one. Obviously one of the best qualities present in this one is the utterly uproarious comedy here as there's a noticeable shift away from a Horror/Comedy into a Comedy with Horror elements. Many of the film's best scenes come from the film's supposedly creepy scenes that instead offer up truly gut- busting laughs, as the scenes of him with the group at the pit after defeating the witch and the deformity there, the goofiness of how he deals with the possessed villager in the castle and the first battle here all manage to go for the comedy rather than the scares here despite all of them appearing to be set-up as horror-based scenes either featuring solid slapstick or hilarious one-liners. The hilarity continues on for two of the funniest, most laugh-out-loud moments in the genre where this one really earns itself the best marks as the battle with the mini-Ash's in the windmill offers plenty of full-scale gags, just utter creativity in the unique situations required to pull them off and a relentless attitude that sends them careening off at such a speed that there's no rest in between the next one. There's also the other big scene of the graveyard resurrection after taking the book through dubious means allows for the glorious wordplay and even better physical gags here that really cement this one as a full-on comedy. It goes on into a comedic Action/Fantasy epic with the finale being the Deadite Army leading the raid on the castle as the defense tactics produce some amazing action, the swordplay makes for a truly enjoyable time and the entire scene is truly a lot of fun as there's the use of more modern warfare and tactics against the traditional swordplay here featured together for a ground time in this section of the film. It also continues on with the typical possession here with some truly fantastic scenes involving the deranged ghouls that showcase the spectacular make- up that this one's been known for as there's the zombie skeleton-like Deadites and the seriously deformed and rotting ghoul featured here with the witch which mall manages to featured something here with the comedy, the action and adventure parts of the film to give this one enough positives to hold out as one of the better efforts in the genre. About the only thing truly wrong here is the own individual reaction to it all who may see it all as too much of a shift in story focusing on the comedy instead of the horror, but that has nothing to do with the movie itself. Otherwise, this is a flawless movie.<br/><br/>Rated R: Language, Graphic Violence, a brief shadowy sex scene and Brief Nudity."

He becomes a feared hero and sets Henry and his men free. Sheila (Embeth Davidtz) hopes that he would battle the evil but Ash only wants to go home.

Continuing from ""Evil Dead 2"" (1987), Ash Williams (Bruce Campbell) was sent back in time and now remains trapped in the Middle Ages. He must continue to battle the ""deadites"", and find a way to return to the present.<br/><br/>The character Ash is now fully developed. Equipped with his signature chainsaw and shotgun (""Boom-Stick""), are these tools and his priceless one liners going to be enough to fight off a legion of the undead? It should also be mentioned that later on Bruce Campbell perfects his performance, by playing Ash's evil demonic clone to hilariously new levels of comedy. In some ways the monster designs are also better with flying demons and graveyard scenarios that feel warm and familiar. Explosions are plenty, as well as a final epic battle to bring this trilogy to a close. This film somewhat succeeds with it's larger production, but feels like it should give more considering it's predecessors freedoms. If this wasn't rated ""R"", I could only imagine what Sam Raimi mannerism's would make it into the picture.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: Sam Raimi & Bruce Campbell perfect ""The Evil Dead"" trilogy with a great send off. 7.5/10."

","I love all three of Sam Raimi's Dead films, recently I purchased the first of the three on Blu ray, and was very pleased. Shockingly enough, it was only today I finally watched Army of Darkness in its entirety; years ago, before I'd really gotten into watching a lot of horror, I'd seen a part of it and not been too enthused. So I was glad to put it on today and find out I really enjoyed it- not only was it satisfying on a make-up effects level, as it knew it would be, the story was great, and the comedy, courtesy of the man Bruce Campbell himself, had me laughing a lot.<br/><br/>Army of Darkness is definitely different from Evil Dead and Evil Dead II- we're back in time, of course it's different! I don't know if that turned some people off or not, but I loved it. I thought that it was smart. Instead of going for another version of Evil Dead or Evil Dead II (let's face it- even though they're both great, the second is mostly a rehash, though I stress I do love all three of these films nearly equally), Raimi takes things to an exciting new level by going back in time with Ash and the Deadites. Such a great way to take the franchise, in my opinion.<br/><br/>As I said before, the make-up effects were great. I think a lot of what they did really elevated what was going on. I particularly love when Ash is thrown into the pit; great scene! Then the chainsaw is dropped in, Ash slips it on in mid-air, and we're off! Army of Darkness proves that you don't have to go with some sort of twisting-turning plot to be successful with a horror movie- at times when Campbell is hamming it up, and hamming well I might add, it's almost like a cross between Monty Python and the Holy Grail, and a horror film.<br/><br/>I give this film a 10 out of 10. Amazed, considering all the horror movies I've seen over the years, it took me so long to finally watch this front to back. Very pleased with it, and I'm definitely going to pop this on again in the near future because I had a blast watching it the first time! Highly recommend it for horror fans and especially those who were fans of Evil Dead and Evil Dead II."

"Joxerlives","8","2","3","5 June 2013"," Terrific stuff, action, humour and horror all in one
","It's an incredibly interesting process to watch the Evil Dead series evolve over time. The first starts out ultra low budget and one of the 'video nasties' that the press was so outraged by in the early 80s. The second is very different in tone, less of a straight horror film than an action comedy. Nowadays considering some of the gorno you do get I think Evil Dead 2 would probably get away with a 15 rating. Personally I'm one who can't be bothered with Evil Dead but think Evil Dead 2 is bloody wonderful. Army of Darkness takes it one step further, really it should have gone all out to be a PG film complete with action figures but you were never going to get that in a film with blood fountains, demon rape and a central character who has a chainsaw instead of one of his hands (famously Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is the most censored film in history because every single scene of a character wielding a set of nunchukas was edited out). Also you would have lost all the hard core horror fans from the first 2 films. <br/><br/>Once again a terrific performance from Bruce Campbell, some killer lines and brilliant spectacle, I wonder what Ray Harryhausen thought of it all?<br/><br/>As for the ambiguity of the ending I figure that Ash miscounts the drops and ends up in the future but eventually overcomes the deadites there and is able to return to his job at S-Mart in the present day, hence the apocalypse ending just precedes the S-mart ending (presumably Ash is too embarrassed to tell the truth).<br/><br/>So part 4? Hmmm, I'd prefer to see maybe another story in the present time with Ash coming to the rescue but we'll see."

","With ""Evil Dead II"" doing modest theatrical and vast video success plans were immediately underway for the third (and final?) installment of Sam Raimi's rollicking horror trilogy. Once again, the film would be bankrolled by Dino De Laurentiis but with a major studio (Universal) and an even higher budget ($13 million) to boot. <br/><br/>Picking up where the last film went off, unassuming S-Mart housewares clerk Ash Williams literally falls out of the sky into England's Dark Ages, which is swarming by ferocious ""Deadites."" Before he can come back home Ash must find the Necronomicon, get the beautiful maiden Shelia and battle his evil counterpart's Army of the Dead. And that's how the plot goes.<br/><br/>But since I'm only reviewing the Director's Cut of ""Army of Darkness"" there might be some spoilers ahead. Although conceived in the same ""splatstick"" style as with the previous film, ""Army"" takes the complete 180-degree turn from blood-spraying horror to the exciting swordplay of Ray Harryhausen epics. Equipped with his trusty chainsaw-hand and ""boomstick"", Bruce Campbell's Ash is at his funniest and perhaps his most chauvinistic right here. And I'm still surprised that Bruce prospered to stay in shape for years between installments. <br/><br/>The supporting actors in ""Army"" are a delight. Embeth Davidtz (""Schindler's List"") is fetchingly gorgeous as both the Good and Bad Shelia. While Marcus Gilbert is okay as Arthur, Richard Grove outshines as Duke Henry. Ian Abercrombie (Mr. Pitt from ""Seinfeld"") is always a welcoming presence as the Wiseman. In the continuing game of musical chairs, Linda is played by a once much-recognizable Bridget Fonda. For the film's scene-stealing moment, Patricia Tallman's possessed witch literally scared the pants off of me when she appeared on camera. I'm dead serious.<br/><br/>When watching the Director's Cut of ""Army,"" I began to see flaws in the film that completely drag especially in the overlong slapstick scenes. The original ending for the international release in which Ash oversleeps in the cave and wakes up in a post-apocalyptic future was a more fitting conclusion. If you've watched all three films closely, you start to wonder why Ash isn't the conventional hero. According to Sam Raimi, he believed Ash was ""more of a fool, which is why he liked to torture him so much in his films"" and ""being a goof and drinking too much potion was in his character."" Well said.<br/><br/>With the ""Evil Dead"" remake released, could it be that fans are going to see an ""Evil Dead IV"" in the near future? Then the answer would beÂ…yes."

But then I got sucked in and was rewarded with a masterpiece of a movie. Immensely entertaining at first watch, later viewings bring up more and more hidden gems of Raimi's direction and vision. Bruce Campbell also grew from a blood splattered pseudo hero to a comedic talent further showcased in the underrated ""Brisco County Jr"" TV show years later.

The Comedy and laughs in the film are hilarious and ingenious and over the top with Sam Raimi using Three Stooges-style Comedy and slapstick in the film and with the character Ash being apart of the joke going through many bizarre and crazy things on his adventure. Ash's journey of trying to get the book of the dead is definitely one of the film's many great and funny highlights,seeing Ash's many reactions to the evil forces around him trying to stop him from getting the book of the dead and the things Ash goes through is over the top and funny. What is also funny is that Ash not only has to deal with evil spirits but also has to deal with the leader of medieval swordsmen to battle the army of the dead and it is hilarious how he teaches and leads the swordsmen how to battle and not act like cowards. Watching Ash being a leader is funny but you as a viewer are rooting for him all the way. AOD is also an homage and parody of films like Jason And The Argonauts and the original Clash Of The Titans in terms of cinematic style and influence,it's an homage to those films but a parody as well especially with the dead skeleton army which is an homage to special effects artist Ray Harryhausen. The skeleton army in the film and the way they're used is absurd and funny and having the army talk and react makes them even funnier. If you love Ray Harryhausen you will AOD. The Action and fight scenes in the film are well-done and fun and add to the film,because the Action isn't always serious to the point when you have to laugh at the wild energy and insanity during the Action scenes and throughout the film. Despite being a sequel to the first two Evil Dead films,some fans maybe a little disappointed to find out that AOD is the lightest film in the Evil Dead trilogy,meaning this film is less of a Horror film and more of Action/Comedy/Fantasy. Where the first two films were Horror films and had blood and gore,AOD was more of an adventure that didn't really need blood or gore because if AOD had that the film would've had a different tone to it and like I said before one of the things I love about the Evil Dead trilogy is that they're all different in tone,if you keep an open mind you'll love all the Evil Dead films including this one because like the first two film AOD has the same crazy and insane energy that the first two had. The ending of the film is a great,Action-packed and very exciting conclusion that will have viewers clapping and cheering at the screen and is one of the reasons that the Evil Dead films,Bruce Campbell and Ash are so legendary and iconic and in the immortal words of Ash it's...groovy.<br/><br/>The cast does a great job. Bruce Campbell is excellent once again as Ash,bringing laughs,Action,toughness and great one-liners. Embeth Davidtz is wonderful and beautiful as Shelia,Ash's love interest. Marcus Gilbert gives a good performance as Lord Arthur and plays it straight. Ian Abercrombie is great as the Wiseman. Richard Grove is wonderful in his small role as Duke Henry The Red. Also lookout for cameos from Bridget Fonda(Linda)and Ted Raimi(S-Mart Store Clerk).<br/><br/>The direction by Sam Raimi is excellent with Raimi with Raimi going nuts with the camera especially with the POV shots of the demons,the tilted angles and Raimi also does well with the Action scenes. Great job,Raimi.<br/><br/>The score by Joseph LoDuca is wonderful and great sounding and fits in with the tone of the film. Great score. Also,lookout for a score cameo from Danny Elfman.<br/><br/>The special make-up effects by K.N.B are well-done,memorable and very realistic. K.N.B does it again.<br/><br/>In final word,if you love the first two Evil Dead's,Sam Raimi,Bruce Campbell,Action,Comedy or Fantasy,you love Army Of Darkness,a classic film that is an great conclusion to an excellent trilogy. Highly Recommended 10/10."
"ernesto-garcia","10","2","3","11 February 2013"," A Genuine Review of Army of Darkness
","Army of Darkness is the third film in the ""Evil Dead"" trilogy. So Army of Darkness is the third film in the series and it is by far the cheesiest and the most comedic. Army of Darkness follows the events of Evil Dead 2. To sum everything up Ash ends up in Med-Evil times and he must lead the ""Screwheads"" into battle against an army of darkness.Army of darkness is the ultimate in camp horror. The film knows that it is cheesy and it runs with it.Honestly, Army of Darkness is so tongue in cheek that you could show it to kids and they would get a kick out of it. I love this film with every ounce of my heart, and the only problem with it,for me, is that I wanted it to be just a tad more serious and the fact that it doesn't quite live up to the second or the original. 9/10"
"joshuawood2012","8","2","3","16 January 2013"," Oh my God! This movie really is good! Er, bad.
","A cult classic, Army of Darkness is the sequel to the horror films Evil Dead and Evil Dead II. The protagonist, a chainsaw armed dealer of awesomeness, is transported back to medieval times, where he must kill an army of undead, and retrieve the Necronomicon to return home. What we get is a cheesy movie so bad, it's good. The quotes and one-liners alone are good enough to rate this movie an eight. <br/><br/>The characters are ridiculous, plot cheesy, and action gory, but there is not a single thing wrong with this movie.

","the first two evil dead movies are two of my favourite horror movies of alltime, they were scary, funny, and impressive. the third chapter in the trilogy is a brilliant movie that is hilereous, very enjoyable again impressive, considering the budget this was made for, but scary this ain't, this time the whole tone is pure comedic, and bruce campbell's ash is bordering on self parody, but that is not a bad thing, as this is bruce campbell's maxum opus, he proves again here that he actually a very funny comedian. don't get me wrong there are horror elements here, there just played more for laughs, and apart from a nice bit if gore at the beginning there isn't any more. the movie isn't perfect though as there are some continuity issues with this and evil dead 2, the big showdown at the end should of been something bigger, and there should of been more deadites than skeleton armies. but no matter army of darkness is a must see movie that will have you rolling with laughter"

","I had heard about this film for many years and finally got around to watching the complete Evil Dead trilogy. This film was pure simple fun. That's what it set out to be and that's exactly what it was. The campy effects suited it perfectly and the story, albeit basic, was fast paced, enjoyable and offered its fair share of laughs. <br/><br/>I can't think of any other character that has been developed like Ash has. From his simple beginnings in the first film, to what he became by the end of this one, I don't think another film maker has ever taken us on that sort of journey before. Kudos to Raimi for doing just that. <br/><br/>If you're looking for an Oscar worthy film, keep looking, but if you're looking for some fun and a way to amply fill 80 minutes, then by all means get it, and press play. Long live Ash!"
"wiggie-5","7","2","3","13 May 2012"," A Look to the Past
","Army of Darkness (1992) is a very different film from its two predecessors. It has nowhere near the amount of horror, gore and atmosphere that the last two films were known for. However, almost everyone can agree that Army of Darkness is one of the funniest films ever made, full of great one-liners, action and special effects that make it so enjoyable. The film boasts a healthy number of fans, and is considered a classic along with its two previous installments.<br/><br/>At the end of Evil Dead II (1987) our main protagonist 'Ash' (Bruce Campbell) is thrown into a time portal and ends up in the year 1300 AD. Trapped in the past, and battling hoards of the undead, Ash must bring peace to the land, and find a way back to his own time.<br/><br/>The violence in Army of Darkness seems to have been toned down to try and gain a wider audience. This would also explain why the film was titles Army of Darkness instead of just simply 'Evil Dead III'. Army of Darkness begins with a recap of previous events, so it's possible to watch this film without having seen the first two. But is this what fans of the previous films wanted? I'm sure that some of the fans, particularly those who are also fans of the horror genre, were disappointed with Army of Darkness's family friendly approach. I know that I was slightly disappointed. However, it was the comedy that won me over. The slapstick gags were all right on cue, and I'd be lying if I said I wasn't entertained. The plot is very original, not following the formula set forth by the previous films.<br/><br/>The special effects of the movie were very well done, especially the work on the makeup. It was convincing enough for the audience to suspend disbelief and get lost in the story. A lot of people agree, me included, that the use of CGI is overused in modern films. This is what makes army of Darkness so visually appealing, relying on the use of puppets and makeup. It's a refreshing change from the CGI we see a lot of today.<br/><br/>Bruce Campbell is still just as brilliant as ever, giving his character plenty of attitude and, well, character. I still have trouble deciding whether Ash is a hero, or just a man caught up in a series of great events. At times he can seem incredibly brave in the face of danger, and at others he can be incredibly arrogant and even cowardly. It makes his character more complex than the usual hero. The whole joke of Army of Darkness is that the fate of the world is left in the hands of a man whose ego is matched only by his incompetence. Ash means well, but he is far too concerned with his own problems than the big picture. Campbell is always a riot to watch, with a great presence on screen. He's definitely an under-appreciated actor.<br/><br/>Army of Darkness isn't as funny as Evil Dead II, which relied on satire and black comedy. Army of Darkness still packs plenty of laughs, but through the use of slapstick instead of over the top violence. The action is great fun to watch, blending in well with the humour. Sam Raimi's trademark camera work also comes into play, remaining entertaining and fresh after three films.<br/><br/>Overall, if you're a fan of the previous films you should definitely see Army of Darkness. It's a fun adventure, and is guaranteed to get at least one laugh out of you."

","Bruce Campbell and Embeth Davidtz star in Sam Raimi's 1992 horror-fantasy sequel. This picks up where the previous film ended with Ash Williams(Campbell) being sent back in time to 1300 A.D. becoming prisoner to a group of knights. He's taken to a pit with 2 demonic creatures, but kills them and survives. Ash demands to get back home and is told by a wise man that he must retrieve an ancient book of the dead, The Necronomicon and say the right words. Of course, Ash makes an error and says the last word wrong waking the army of the dead. He lets the people down, but soon proves himself and persuades them to fight for the book. Campbell also plays Evil Ash, the leader of the army and Davidtz plays damsel in distress, Sheila who falls for Ash. This is my favorite in the ""Evil Dead"" trilogy and Bruce is great as usual. I also like Danny Elfman's ""March of the Dead"" theme and the film has theatrical & director's versions plus an original ending. I recommend this cult classic."

"Red-Barracuda","7","2","3","30 July 2010"," Raimi and Campbell sign-off in fine style
","One reason that the Evil Dead series is such a satisfying trilogy of movies is that Sam Raimi added to the formula with each new instalment in an intelligent way. Where the first film was an out-and-out horror film, the second was a horror-comedy, while Army of Darkness was a horror-comedy-fantasy. This meant that each movie has its own distinct personality, while sharing a single core idea. With Army of Darkness, Raimi produced the most commercial entry in the series and played down the horror element in favour of fantasy battles and humour. The latter is mainly provided, of course, by Bruce Campbell. He is such an important part of this movie that it is inconceivable to imagine him not in it. Similar to his turn in Evil Dead 2, Campbell puts in a comic acting master-class. His brand of hammy acting and physical knock-about humour really has to be seen to be believed. Campbell's considerable cult reputation is hugely based on his performances in these two films; he is quite simply a revelation. Of course, Sam Raimi has to be credited too, as his kinetic style of direction is a perfect match for Campbell's over-the-top style of comic acting. Raimi remains one of the few directors who has consistently found a way of combining comedy and horror effectively. No mean feat, as all too often, despite the abundance of comedy-horrors, very rarely do they succeed in being either funny or scary.<br/><br/>So Army of Darkness is a great way for the series to sign off. Although I think it is probably the third best of the trilogy, as I feel it runs out of steam a little once Ash has returned from his quest. At this point the film becomes basically an extended battle with the hordes of evil, which is fair enough; however, it suffers by comparison to the hilarity and invention that constitutes Ash's ill-begotten quest to find the Book of the Dead. Needless to say, Bruce Campbell and Sam Raimi are in their element in this first half of the movie. While some of the special effects are looking a bit ropey nowadays, it's not a significant problem to be perfectly honest. Army of Darkness is a cult classic for good reason, and it is well worth a look."

","Ash gets caught up in a space-time vortex which hurls him back to the Middle Ages. Captured by a band of knights, he is taken to their castle but secures his freedom by defeating an undead monster. The Wise Man tells him he must quest for a sacred book, The Necronomicon, which contains magical incantations that can send him home. Ash finds the book, but the plan does not quite work out Â…<br/><br/>The third Evil Dead movie (or The Medieval Dead, as I like to think of it) is fabulous fun from start to finish. It's that rare sequel which goes for a completely different story and feel (see also The Curse Of The Cat People or Halloween III: Season Of The Witch); in this case the all-out horror and gory mayhem of the previous movies are replaced with more old-fashioned adventure, funny lingo, a romantic subplot and a sensational action set piece as hordes of skeletal warriors descend upon our besieged band of heroes. It's beautifully anachronistic and silly, playing like an old Errol Flynn flick, but with a fifties comic book superhero and the cast of A Connecticut Yankee In King Arthur's Court, all of whom seem to have wandered into a George Romero zombie epic. Campbell's square-jawed antics are simply sensational, and both he and Davidtz have a whale of a time playing both star-crossed heroes and their evil alter egos. If I had to pick a funniest moment, it's when Ash fluffs the ritual to retrieve the book (which is filched from The Day The Earth Stood Still) and confidently asserts, ""Okay then. That's it."". I just can't get enough of Raimi and Campbell's Three Stooges why-you-little slapstick; these people are born entertainers, and their movie is just crammed full of amazing sights - a man pulling himself out of a book, a windmill infested with crazed imps, an amazing shot from the ramparts of the army of darkness marching through the misty night towards the castle like a scene out of Macbeth. The visual effects, by William Mesa, the KNB team and Tony Gardner are outstanding, as is the photography by Bill Pope, and there are fantastic stunts throughout. Joseph LoDuca's gorgeous music captures the playful adventurer spirit of the movie perfectly, and is bolstered by a great pounding march theme by Danny Elfman. Written by Raimi and his older brother Ivan (his younger brother Ted also has a small role), the movie exists in two versions; the 81-minute original US release, and a longer European/video version, which extends several scenes (notably the windmill and the final battle) and has a completely different (and just as good/funny) ending. If possible, catch the rather nifty Anchor Bay DVD release, which contains both. This movie also has several titles (Evil Dead 3 and variants), but I like the on-screen title, Bruce Campbell Vs Army Of Darkness, a nod to the goofy good-natured Mexican wrestling and Japanese monster movies of the sixties, with which it shares many sensibilities. Don't miss funny little roles by stuntwoman / actress Tallman (as the witch) and the always sublime Fonda. If you're looking for a nice crazy movie to sit back, chuckle and gasp through, this is a guaranteed crowd pleaser every time, featuring arguably the finest B-movie performance in all cinema. Hail to the King, baby !"
"joshi_3592","8","2","3","24 December 2009"," I'm not sure what this is supposed to be, but I like it!
","I must say this film surprised me. The Evil Dead was one of the creepiest and scariest fantasy horror movies I've ever seen. Evil Dead 2 was also scary but had a little dark humour in it. Army of darkness however, is just pure fun. I don't know why Sam Raimi made it this way, I guess he was tired of making scary movies, but liked the character to much. And let's be honest, Bruce Campbell is awesome, who would want to watch him tackle demons and monsters over and over again.<br/><br/>I guess the only thing I didn't like about this movie, was it's lack of continuity. Weapons kinda appeared out of nowhere and Ash never seemed to run out of bullets. but then again it's not exactly a serious movie so maybe they didn't really care. I'm not really complaining, I loved this movie.<br/><br/>Although Army of Darkness kinda focuses on slapstick humour, it still fits well into the trilogy. There are still deadits and the Necrocromicon is as annoying as always. They've just tuned down the blood and gore. And since Ash after being beaten up in the two prequels, is mow worthy of the title action here. He knows all their tricks, he's not scared anymore, and let's face it, he's not very afraid of pain anymore. I mean he did cut off his own hand in Evil Dead 2.<br/><br/>So Ash is tougher than ever, and the deadits are quite that scary when your not trapped in an small cabin anymore. For it's minor flaws and hilarious story, I give this movie an 8/10."
"Sirus_the_Virus","10","2","3","23 December 2009"," Absolutely ridiculous.
","Horror films now days aren't what they used to be. They now focus on sex and gore. Not that they didn't in the old days(the good ones), but now that is all a horror film is. I think that the best kind of horror film is one that is so ridiculous that it's funny. Like 2009's Drag me to hell. I loved that movie, because it stuck with the good old days. In the old days of horror, I loved The Evil dead because it was so ridiculous it was funny. Coincidentaly, both Drag me to hell and The Evil dead trilogy are from the same director.<br/><br/>The original Evil dead film was so ridiculously gory that it didn't even have a rating. So, I would think that Sam Raimi watched it and thought"" this is quite funny"" because in the first one I laughed my ass off.<br/><br/>The sequel was billed as a horror. But it was actually pretty hilarious. Sam Raimi decided to remake it and make it funnier. He did very well and turned these films into classics. Then, he got to the third film.<br/><br/>The third film is also billed as a horror. But you know what, even the third time I am sure Sam Raimi didn't aim for the horror. No way. Army of Darkness, the third part, is all comedy. Army of darkness is ridiculously funny, With scenes from The three stooges and other ridiculous things.<br/><br/>Army of darkness continues from the sequel. Ash(played by the always excellent Bruce Campbell), the department store, shot gun slinging, chainsaw armed survivor is sent back to the middle ages. There, he is to find the book of the dead and kill the army of the dead. <br/><br/>Here, plot doesn't really matter. Like in the first and second there wasn't much of one. The thing that is so great about these films is how ridiculous they are. It's really not a horror film at all. It's a comedy. Usually, in the third part of a trilogy, once it gets to the third part, it's the weakest. With this trilogy, none of them are weak."

The skeleton army is great and I love the fact that they are slightly disgruntled.<br/><br/>Yes, it's a homage to various other films in a way, but it's not overly reverential. It doesn't take itself too seriously and I think it's very hard to strike that balance of horror and comedy. To be fair, I would say that this is more of an adventure comedy, though.<br/><br/>Ultimately, if you can't let go and have a blast watching this then it probably doesn't say many good things about you.<br/><br/>""Well hello Mr. Fancy-pants!"""

","The third, and so far final installment to Sam Raimi's ""Evil Dead"" franchise, ""Army Of Darkness"" of 1992 once again takes the ingenious premise of the films into a very different direction. ""The Evil Dead"" of 1981 is, without any doubt, one of the greatest and most terrifying Horror films of all-time. The first sequel, ""Evil Dead II"" of 1987 was a reprise of the original, turned into a hilariously morbid Gore-Comedy, rather than a sequel. This third part, which is even more comical than the second, is an outrageously entertaining mixture of Comedy, Horror/Gore and action blockbuster. ""Army Of Darkness"" takes Ash (Bruce Campbell), survivor of the first two installments to the series, to Medieval times. After being taken prisoner and almost fed to demons, Ash has to help the Medieval humans who took him prisoner defend the infernal forces of Evil, in order to get back to the future... If there is one word to properly describe ""Army Of Darkness"" it is 'entertainment'. Pure, fast-paced, fresh and absolutely awesome entertainment. While neither of the sequels is as admirable a masterpiece as the 1981 original, they are both insanely entertaining. ""Army Of Darkness"" is arguably one of the greatest films to watch with beers and buddies, simply because it delivers everything that makes a Horror/Action/Comedy flick fun to watch. Nonstop action, a great setting, rich atmosphere, awesome Horror monsters, never-ending fun, and one of the greatest Horror- heroes ever, Ash, played by the almighty Bruce Campbell. Overall, the film seems like an awesome pairing of ""Evil Dead II"", ""Excalibur"" and ""Back To The Future"", which promises loads of fun, and this promise is kept. Beautiful Embeth Davidtz makes a great female lead, and the rest of the cast also fit their roles very well. Thanks to a higher budget, ""Army Of Darkness"" features spectacular special effects and great settings. It should be said that there are several versions of this film, and that the 96 minute director's cut is the one to watch.<br/><br/>***WARNING BIG SPOILERS AHEAD!*** Not are there different versions in length of this film, the film also has two different endings. Towards the end of the film, Ash receives a magic potion that allows him to go back to his time. The ending in most theatrical versions brings Ash back to the present time, where he has to take care of a witch in the S-Mart he works in. In the original ending as Sam Raimi intended it, however, Ash takes too much of the potion, and subsequently awakens in a menacing future... The Studios made the 'Happy' ending because they thought audiences would like it better. Both endings are cool and should be seen by any Horror fan. ""Army Of Darkness"" is a fantastic third part in a series that always delivered fresh new aspects. This is as entertaining as it gets, and no lover of Horror should miss it."
"BigBirdtheBum","8","2","3","3 November 2008"," Not at the same level of excellence of the first two ""Evil Dead"" films, but still nonetheless, a small triumph for the horror-comedy genre.
","Not at the same level of excellence of the first two ""Evil Dead"" films, but still nonetheless, a small triumph for the horror-comedy genre. The reasons for me considering this film to be below the first two are pretty straightforward. Now while the first two ""Evil Dead"" films had gore, but this films lacks it (I am aware of the cuts Raimi was forced to make), this film is also not as funny as the second Evil Dead films, and the effects to seem a little cheaper despite the bigger budget of about 10 million.<br/><br/>In the nature of ""Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn"" the film picks of were its predecessor left off. Ash (Bruce Campbell) is sucked into a vortex after being stuck in the same cabin, for the last two films and arrives in the year 1300AD. Now considering he spent the first two films fighting Deadites (think demons) summoned by the Necromoicon, this film is no different. Ash falls from the sky with his car and is approached by knights. After trying to kill Ash and realizing his power as a hero, they become convinced he is the chosen one said to free the world of the Deadites. Ash is requested to go and recover the Necromoicon from its resting place (a graveyard) so its deadly works can be stopped. Ash agrees on the basis that the book can send him back to his time. Unfortunately things don't go as plan, and once again ash is pitted against deformed monsters from his worst nightmare trying to capture his soul.<br/><br/>Now what ""Army of Darkness"" succeeds in is creating a daunting and impressive fantasy world roamed by monsters with its limited budget. Despite costing only 10 million to make the sets include a castle, an old abandoned windmill and a ghastly graveyard. These sets look impressive and are accompanied by equally good creature effects. Now remember this film came out before CGI composed creature effects (so keep that in mind). The beautiful yet hideous creatures include a gargoyle like Deadite and a hideously deformed Evil Ash. These realistic and rather daunting effects create an effective atmosphere, which surprisingly still manages to generate some laughs.<br/><br/>Now I said some laughs, as personally I think the film was not as funny as the second ""Evil Dead"" film. The first film had Ash being beaten up by his own hand, which really was one of the funniest few minutes I ever saw. Now ""Army of Darkness"" has laughs, but not as many as many as Dead by Dawn. The laughs of this film include Ash forgetting what he has to chant when collecting the Necromoicon, and instead he coughs the last word, and takes the book. This results in him being b****-slapped by a bunch of skeletons. And of course results in a massive siege which almost destroys the people Ash is trying to save. And before this ash is also attacked and beaten up by a fake version of the Necromoicon, and another nearly sucks him into another vortex. Unfortunately it also seems that Raimi tried to hard to create humor, and hence some of it really stinks.<br/><br/>For example one scene I found particular tasteless, was when ash is attached by several miniature evil copies of himself, which arise from his reflection in a broken mirror. Now this mini Ash's beat Ash up in ways which seem unfunny and rather stupid. He is tied down by them and one of them jumps in his mouth (it later grows out of him), and they also ram a fork into his backside. While most people will find this funny personally I did not.<br/><br/>Now before I conclude, I have to mention the closing battle. While the first two ""Evil Dead"" films had a low body count this raps up one above 100. The closing minutes of the picture feature a siege on a castle of people (whom Ash saves). Fans of the first two will be happy to see Ash rip apart Deadites with his shotgun and improvised vehicle-of-death, as well as knights smashing apart and blowing up hordes of skeletons. Although some parts of the battle are quite cheesy, the siege is still quite impressive considering it was conceived with such a low budget and without major known effect artists.<br/><br/>Overall I give his film a 7.3/10, the lowest of the ""Evil Dead"" trilogy, but certainly in no way a bad film. Now for the parents, despite ""Army of Darkness"" R- rating the film is a very light R (in fact it was almost rated PG in Australia) so anyone about the age of 13 should be OK. But still watch it with your children as the Deadites at times are quite disturbing and there is one brief scene of sexual assault."

","I'm glad to see the fairly high rating for this film on IMDb; as Sam Raimi did an excellent job with this film; The third entry in The Evil Dead Series; this film meets the standard of horror excellence seen in the first two. I appreciate the special effects because of the care and effort afforded to them. In fact, I would rather watch this film any night of the week, opposed to some modern horror sh-lop laced with cheap CGI. <br/><br/>This is a film that doesn't take itself too seriously, which is an aspect of the other two in the series. That's actually why I took two stars off this one. I think all three Dead entries could have taken themselves much more seriously. But don't get me wrong. This one is good. <br/><br/>It has Campbell thrown back into the dark ages to battle demons and the Army of Darkness. It was good they did this with the storyline, as the cabin storyline was out of gas. I'd love to see a fourth one made, basing it's story more on the third one than the first too.

","The ""Evil Dead"" trilogy has to be the most diverse trilogy ever created. The first movie was sort of funny, but it was a genuine horror movie. The second film still had the same creepy sets and horror elements from the first film, but was much more comical. The acting was extremely over the top as were many of the scenes, such as the hilarious laughing scene. Then we get to ""Army of Darkness"". All the horror from the series is gone, and the slapstick comedy introduced in the second film is prevalent.<br/><br/>Ash (Bruce Campbell) was the only survivor from the last film and he has landed in a time warp in the 13th Century. In order to get back to his own time he must recite a phrase and find Necronomicon, the book of the dead, and it ends in war between the living and the ""Deadites"".<br/><br/>This is not an original movie in any way, and if not looked at as purposely bad, this will be viewed as bad. The script is full of some truly awful one liners, such as ""Give me some sugar baby!"", many uses of the phrase ""Groovy."", and dozens more terribly hilarious lines. The action scenes here seem very Three Stooges inspired, from the slaps to the face and the blocking of the pokes to the eyes, to the cuckoo clock sound effects used when Ash is a little out of it. The villains are not as menacing as in the last movies because they all are comical, but this is not a complaint. The light tone of the movie makes the lines funnier and the movie enjoyable.<br/><br/>If you enjoy silly comedies and/or slapstick comedies, then you will probably love this. If you are expecting horror after seeing the last two movies, then you are in the wrong place.<br/><br/>My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 80 mins. R for violence."

","My Take: Some of the slapsticks may grate, but the film is still manic and wildly original. <br/><br/>Sam Raimi has never really been one of my favorite directors, but I've got to admit about how stylish he often is when it comes to making his movies. ARMY OF DARKNESS is the third film in the EVIL DEAD series, and since I haven't seen the first two yet, I'm reviewing simply this film, without making references or comparisons to its predecessors. But ARMY OF DARKNESS still does fill the void for those who might not seen the first film, therefore free from confusion.<br/><br/>The film isn't related to its predecessors either. For, while the first two films are more of horror films (or a satire of horrors), this one is also an old-fashioned sword-and-sorcery film, complete with cheesy (intentional) dialog and swashbuckling battle scenes. The good thing about it is that Raimi takes it all less seriously, and producing a number of hilarious bits as well.<br/><br/>Bruce Campbell reprises his role as the chainsaw-armed store clerk Ash, who is whisked into the Dark Ages, facing rival kingdoms and the army of the dead along the way. To get him back home, he must retrieve the Necronomicon, the cursed Book with the Dead, which can also prevent a small kingdom from being invaded by the ""Deadites"". It ends up with a final confrontation against the army of Deadites when they are awakened by their lust to get the Book of the Dead back.<br/><br/>Cheesy isn't it? But that's just the point. ARMY OF DARKNESS aims for a mockery, and it does a great job and rewards greatly. It's a lot of fun, with lots of in jokes and its own jokes, thanks greatly to the presence of Bruce Campbell, he's effectively funny. The 'low-budget' special effects are fun, and if you think they look cheesy, try saying that to the great Ray Harryhausen, which these effects pay homage to.<br/><br/>ARMY OF DARKNESS is filled with dozens of slapstick humor and lack a number of smarter wit, but even so, it's a lot of fun and craziness. Viewers, including eventual fans of the director, will enjoy the films craziness and wit, but more on the macabre style that took to create it. It's an all special effects extravaganza, but not without being an imaginative one.<br/><br/>Rating: ***1/2 out of 5."

","The hero who fell from the sky in his greatest adventure ever. Bruce Campbell, his chainsaw, and his boomstick, and a whole bunch of silliness. The film is about Bruce trying to get back to modern times from 1300 AD and in the process he saves a kingdom from the undead forces of the Deadites. While Evil Dead 2 set up Ash as a great character it takes Army of Darkness to unlock all the potential that is Ash...<br/><br/>A plethora of classic lines spewed from the mouth of Bruce Campbell make this one of the best horror-comedies to ever be put on film... So whether you've seen the other Evil Dead films or not I recommend this film to a high degree. Silly effects, cheesy lines, what more can you ask, its a self-spoof..."

","Army of Darkness (1992)<br/><br/>** out of ****<br/><br/>Directed by Sam Raimi<br/><br/>With Bruce Campbell<br/><br/>Ash (Yes, from ""The Evil Dead"") wakes up in 1300 A.D and now must recover the Necronomicon to save the city and back to its time. Disappointing third and last (It seems) entry in ""The Evil Dead"" series which seemingly begins where the ""Dead by Dawn"" ends. Not with the sweet Ash of the last entries, here is more rude, like a comic book hero. Great special effects, specially with the ""Jason and the Argonauts"" look a like skeletons, which are, maybe, the best highlight in this movie. Kind of funny, but really inferior to great ""Evil Dead"" and ""Dead by Dawn"". Get back in the woods."

","Many people have tried to make crazy horror-comedies, and many has failed. But those who have succeeded, has really made a tasty goulash of horror and humor. Two other good examples I can think of is Peter Jackson's cult movie ""Braindead"" and the modern British cult-classic ""Shaun of the Dead."" But still, my favorite remains ""The Evil Dead trilogy"", and especially ""The Army Of Darkness.""<br/><br/>The movies takes place shortly after the second movie ends. It opens with a small flashback to the moments when Ash has been forced to cut off his possessed hand, and replacing it with a chainsaw. He then escapes through a time vortex he summoned with the aid of the Necronomicon (the book of the dead) which all the movies plots are based upon. The book, covered in human skin, and written in human blood contains a direct gateway two the underworld and in the wrong hands it may provoke the end of the world. In the first movies Ash has his hands full trying to fight off his friends which all are turned in to horrible demons. In the third movie Ash find that in the past people are living in constant fear of the living dead who roams the land. It's time to fight back. Good ting he brought his chainsaw and boom-stick (a twin-barrel shotgun which can fire a surprisingly high numbers of shots in a row.)<br/><br/>This is the final movie in the ""Evil Dead"" trilogy,"" and the movies goofiness and crazy-humor is accelerating from the original and comes to it's climax the third movie. The Army of Darkness is like the first two ""Evil Dead movies"" hovering gracefully in the strange spot between a ""low budget horror turkey"" and a well directed epic tale of bravery and bone-chilling terror. It's a movie poorly made in many ways. The ""sceleton army"" looks like a bunch of those plastic skeletons your biology teacher used to drag out from a closet, and the voice overs is sometimes done with a goofy German accent. There's one thing that saves Army of Darkness from being ridiculous, and that is that it's fully aware of it's own flaws. Sam Raimi is by my opinion a genius, and manage to turn the sometimes terrible special effects into a vital part of the movies humor. It's not a bad, it's just not taking itself very seriously! This movie is far from a ""low budget turkey."" It's got a great plot, a great cast (wonderfull overacting by Bruce Campbell) and it got some really god laughs.<br/><br/>It exist two versions of this movie. The original theater version and the directors-cut. The main difference is the endings. One containing the well known catchphrase ""Hail to the king, baby!"" and a sort-of happy ending to the trilogy. The other version a much darker anticlimax which leaves everything in a worse condition than when the trilogy started. I recommend seeing both :)"

","Sam Raimi's third entry in the Evil Dead has certainly evolved from the intentions of the first. Whereas The Evil Dead is coined ""the ultimate experience in grueling terror,"" this one is more righteously ""the ultimate experience in horror with comedic medieval skeleton warriors-Bruce Campbell one-liners... and a boomstick!"" The Army of Darkness seeks to take the comedy element of the series and put it at the forefront. When I view this I can't help but think of a mash-up between my dad's Three Stooges collection, Conan the Barbarian (not the one with Arnold!), and... well... any movie with Bruce Campbell! <br/><br/>Some people who have not ever seen this film will believe it to be a truly scary film as it is rated R and additionally due to the fact that it appears in the horror section of most rental stores. Do not be fooled though, there is only spots of language and I don't think that there is one jumpy scene in the whole movie (although the eyeball in the shoulder ALWAYS makes me squirm a bit) and it really doesn't feature much gore. The Army of Darkness is a culmination of the comedy element of Evil Dead 2 amplified 10x, tossed in a blender with the skeletons from Conan and a handful of mini-Ashes! <br/><br/>The movie picks right up where we left off in Evil Dead 2 with Ash and his Oldsmobile being transported back in time through a warp opened by the Necronomicon. He lands, and instead of being praised as savior like the end of 2 shows, he is questioned as one of King Henry's men and taken as prisoner back to the castle to be thrown into the pit. ""Into the pit with those blood-thirsty sons of whores!"" Ash manages to escape and must seek out the Necronomicon to return home. The movie unfolds at an unrelenting pace relying on action sequence after action sequence and more special effects than you can shake a boomstick at. <br/><br/>This movie is truly hilarious. If you enjoy slapstick comedy, Bruce Campbell, the concept of a man with a sawed-off shotgun and a chainsaw for an arm fighting hordes of skeletons and monsters, outrageous one-liners, early 90's special effects, and good movies in general, do yourself a favor and grab a bowl of popcorn and copy of Army of Darkness this weekend, you won't be let down."

","Not having seen Evil Dead movies, in any form, up pops Bruce Campbell vs. the Army of Darkness, a quirky , off beat , campy film of the Fantasy genre, that pins Bruce against the evil forces, in a medieval setting, not at his discretion....<br/><br/>I can only imagine that when Sam Raimi, Director and co-script writer, and Bruce Campbell got together, they were both on the same page as what kind of movie they wanted to make, and they did a fine job of it.<br/><br/>Ash(Bruce Campbell) gets transported from present time to 1300 A.D. for trying to read prohibited material about the undead . Thought to be a prophet, he becomes the love interest of Sheila(Embeth Davidtz), and must recover the Necomicron(a book of the dead), to return home. Not the brightest bulb on the tree, he doesn't completely recite the 3, count them 3, little words that he needs to get him home, Klatu Baratta Nicktu, sound familiar ?, yeah, they are from the 1951 film, ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"", a science fiction classic. Those words were to be delivered to Gort, the giant robot, after Michael Rennie was shot.<br/><br/>Anyway, the battle scenes between the skeletons is where the conflict reaches its' zenith, and it is a most memorable one...The battle scenes are a little uneven because the lack of consistency of the special effects....but Bruce carries the film nicely, and delivers a fine performance .<br/><br/>So,if you want to escape reality for about 81 minutes, then you should try this tasty morsel, for your viewing pleasure .<br/><br/>Campy fun , for the young at heart !!!"
"emperor_bender","10","2","3","28 November 2007"," Watch Smart....watch this movie....GOT THAT?!?!?!?!?
","Undoubtedly one of my favorite movies. Army of Darkness was nothing but pure fun to watch, and how anyone could hate it is beyond me. Before I go into detail, I'd like to make a few pointers to the reviewers who scolded this movie since they were so ridiculously stupid: 1. Of course the graphics aren't gonna be GREAT, this was made in 1992, not 2002 you primitive screwheads. CG were a relatively new thing still. So stop saying ""The graphics sucked"". 2. The movie is supposed to be goofy, not scary. The first movie of the series was scary, but then they decided to take a new direction and go for comedy, hence Evil Dead II and Army of Darkness. I thought they did a hell of a job myself, Ash's lines were always funny because they were corny and random, he wasn't trying to be Hannibal Lecter and always have smart and sophisticated things to say. 3. Its not supposed to make sense. The mechanical hand and the chainsaw would never work in real life, I realize that. I don't need you to point it out. Part of the fun in this movie was the unrealisticness (if that is a word) If this movie was 100% realistic, there'd be no movie at all considering a worm hole cant open and take you to 1300 AD. There'd be no Evil Dead series altogether. So stop with the stupid ""unrealistic"" comments. .... well, now that that is out of the way, the movie was fun to watch, I thought I'd be taking a gamble buying it without seeing it or Evil Dead II first. I didn't even need to see the 2nd movie to get this one, it explains it all in the beginning. I saw the first movie, but that and Army of Darkness have almost nothing in common. But over all, I'm glad I took the chance and payed $6 for this movie, it was money well spent.<br/><br/>Great movie, was a lot of fun to watch, never really a dull moment (except one or 2 parts but come on, all movies have that).<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to fans of Evil Dead I&II, and to anyone just looking for a comedy/horror movie. Remember, you don't need to see the first 2 movies to see this one.<br/><br/>10/10"
"legendaryunderdog","8","2","3","2 November 2007"," Sam Raimi had to put an end to the series somehow!
","What was once a tale of terror in the woods has now become an epic story that dates back to the 1300's, in the time of King Arthur and what-have-you. This movie shows Raimi's love for slapstick comedy and Bruce Campbell turns in a great performance as Ash once again, Campbell's one-liners are hilarious but seemed a little too 'dummied-down' if you know what I mean. I feel this movie lacked the technical sophistication that Raimi usually thrived on in earlier films, it seemed a little too sloppy and cheesy in some moments (Raimi never lost his touch there). I was about 80% satisfied with the movie and 20% critical of how it was handled. Overall it is a great, enjoyable and laughter filled picture but the plot just seemed too condensed, I just really feel that the plot could have had more meat on it's bones, oh well, all in all I'am still glad Raimi came out with this movie and I look forward to another possible sequel in the future if he decides so."

Basically rip roaring action with amazing set pieces, and amusing dialogue ""Gimmie some sugar baby"" well worth spending 90 Min's watching, for the best entertainment id suggest the directors cut version which features more battle scenes which makes the film even better also has the alternate ending of Ash sleeping to long, the first ""happy(ish) ending is good but the other far superior"

","From the mind that spawned Xena and Young Hercules comes a brilliant farce about a man from the 20th century hurled backwards in time and forced to destroy an ancient evil if he wants to get back home. Sam Raimi is well known as the man who transferred Stephen King's ""the Shining"" into a movie form. Here, he goes beyond horror into horror spoof. Army of Darkness might *look* like a poorly-made B-type movie, but that's really purely wonderful directing. It's *supposed* to look like a B movie because it engages in a lot of playful mocking of undead horror movies like ""Night of the Living Dead."" It is also the movie from which emerges one of the all-time classic lines of all time: ""This...is my BOOMSTICK!!"""
"gir2887","10","2","3","25 January 2007"," A Horror Movie That Backfired And Still Got The Point Across
","Army of Darkness qualifies itself, at least to what I believe, to be at the beating heart of all cult fanaticism. This legendary movie, equal yet still somewhat separate from the Evil Dead movies before it may seem to be nothing more than an outdated film with excessive amounts of cheese now, but beneath that lies a message that's actually innocent and light-hearted; not to mention, the years of horrible horror movies to follow the Evil Dead series would make Army of Darkness into an accidental parody, as well.<br/><br/>As the story goes, it follows Ash, played by the now endeared-to-a-generation Bruce Campbell as the sole living survivor of an attack by demons and darkness, ""deadites"", on a cabin in the secluded woods. As he thinks he's safe, the darkness of the necronomicon - a book of evil incantations and summonings bound in flesh and inked blood - returns to pull Ash back into the middle ages amidst a somewhat confused war during the increasing gravity of the evil and deadites on their land. However, instead of being treated as a saviour or wizard, he's instantly bound and thrown into battle with a deadite in true Roman arena fashion. Of course, he has a chainsaw for a hand, man. And he's Ash. He defeats the deadite and in Indiana Jones' manner, pulls himself from the pit he's thrown into, and the hilarity ensues: ""...Shop smart. Shop S-Mart. YOU GOT THAT?!"" It's one-liner after glorious Ash/Campbell one-liner as he ventures to retrieve and hold the necronomicon away from and invading horde of deadites and skeletons, as well as an evil Ash.<br/><br/>As amazing as the plot sounds, and the fine points in between that progress the story, watching the movie is a completely different experience. I only wish I wasn't five at the time so I could've enjoyed it in the all-encompassing encapsulation of a theater. You can tell from the first few minutes re-summarizing the nights before that this movie is no modern-day Matrix. The DVD featurettes say the movie was filmed with a revolutionary film technique called Introvision, but referring to the movie, you'd probably just laugh again, however it's actually one of the strengths of the movie. With modern-day horror films, there's a tremendous over-doing of ""deaditting."" Cutting and chopping a movie to make it appear scary but shoving in loud and obnoxious sound-bytes of single or few-frame splices of a catastrophe, or a contorted face, or... you get the picture. This, in and of itself, was actually one of the accidental parodies I was mentioning earlier. Whereas now, the somewhat dated special effects definitely appeal to the atmosphere of the movie, it's become sort of an inadvertent shot at the lackluster horror movies of today, but manages to add in insult by having such a sense of humor with such an original storyline.<br/><br/>And of course, no actor could've pulled the part better than Bruce Campbell. The Hollywood cult-extra, he's appeared in so many things as a usually arbitrary character that you don't seem to notice him. However, no one else could've done Ash like Bruce Campbell did. He bleeds personality and there's not a single moment of the movie that isn't funny in some way, shape or form, and it's largely due to him. Not only did his facial expressions and idiosyncrasies seem almost pre-destined for this movie, but the Bruce Campbell voice is just unmistakable and his delivery defines deadpan. Simple one-liners had me on the floor just because of the amazing delivery.<br/><br/>And of course, underneath all that's going for this movie lies its beating heart, which most people don't seem to get up-front. It's a message that the 90's, dawn of apathy in America, still has a heart that can be as light as the days that people were young. Sure, not all of the humor is all-audience, but the same token, it's not in the same league comedies like Airplane! and Top Gun were. It was more exposing the beating heart underneath the dead skin by going back to a more slap-stick and motional style of humor. When Ash is in the graveyard getting the Stooges treatment by the skeletons, it's impossible not to laugh just because of nostalgia. It's one of the few movies where the humor is as much in how the characters talk and act as what they say and do.<br/><br/>As time goes on and horror movies get shittier, Army of Darkness embeds itself further as a gem amongst American cinema and cements Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell into movie history as a visionary and a genius."

","This movie is the Starship Troopers of the horror genre. A film created to mock the industry in a way subtle enough to be missed by the casual observer. Army of Darkness is a bit more blatant in its self-ridiculing mannerisms than the preceeding ""Evil Dead"" and ""Evil Dead II"", yet many miss those overtones while watching. Don't expect the gory shock value of ""The Hills Have Eyes"" nor the psychological depth of ""Saw"", but to appreciate what this film is trying to say, a certain familiarity with horror films of their nature is recommended. As the prototypical cult classic the Evil Dead series will forever remain largely misunderstood, but to those within the cult who understand and appreciate it, these films will leave you wanting ""more sugar baby!"""
"gordon-284","9","2","3","15 November 2006"," Bruce's best work to date.
","Bruce Cambells finest achievement to date. This movie is the reason fans consider Bruce Cambell to be the god of B-movies. ""Army of Darkness"" and his book ""If chins could kill"" are Bruce's greatest contribution to modern alternate movie culture. ""Evil Dead"" and ""Evil Dead II"" pale in comparison. For those of you not familiar with the many famous lines from ""Army of Darkness"", I suggest you play the retro computer game ""Duke Nukem"". Duke should have been called Ash, because in style, tone and direct quote he is pure Ash! Bruce has also put in solid performances in 2 to 3 episodes of every Xena and Hercules season made, but again, these are average in comparison to his defining role in ""Army of Darkness"". For a different take on Bruce Cambell watch the new release ""The Woods"" (release date 2006): A good horror movie which in style strongly reminded me of ""The Craft"". It is about the supernatural goings-on at an all girls school in a secluded neck of the woods. This movie is way above his usual B-grade stuff, you might even call it a commercial hit. It is certainly miles above his recent Z-grade crap ""Man with a Screaming Brain"". As the man himself said ""Hail to the King baby!!"""

When I first bought this movie, I thought it wasn't gonna be that good. Finally, after a year of it sitting their in my collection, I picked it up, popped it in the DVD player and watched. I was proved wrong. I was laughing so hard, I started running around, I hit my head on the wall and got a concussion. This film takes off exactly where Evil Dead II left off. I love that little narrative that Ash gives at the beginning. The movie is basically about Ash, who gets transported back in time and gets captured by knights in 1300 A.D. Once they believe he is the man sent to destroy the deadites, he learns that the only way he can get back home is to receive the Necronomicon and destroy the army of darkness. Bruce Campbell always has to make it hard for himself. Ash has to go through heroic, dangerous, and hilarious obstacles to achieve his goal. Between the cartwheeling deadite in the pit, the mini ashes, evil ash, the hilarious army of skeletons, and Evil Ash again, this has to be th most hilarious action ever. And Ash is so obnoxious, it's hilarious to watch him get pummeled by every barrel of lard and skeleton in his path. The key that makes this movie so good is the blend of comedy and action. The special effects may be flawed, but are breathtakingly good for this type of movie. You'll have to watch this movie to really see how good this is.

"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","10","2","3","29 January 2006"," In a word: awesome
","The Evil Dead series evolved from being cult, low-budget horror to comedy... medieval adventure comedy, to be precise. The first film was basically pure horror, the second was horror-comedy with a nice slice of action... now, third time around, the slice is thicker, the horror is nearly absent and we've got the all-new setting of a medieval castle instead of the secluded house in the woods. I understand that this has been met with some hostility from the fan-base... too different from the first two, they say. Interesting development, I say. With the only real changes between the films being in tone, there needs to be some genre changes and major character development. Ash is the only character who's in all the films(since he's basically the only survivor). He goes from being a dull background kind of male romantic interest and kind of coward to a bit of a tough guy in the first... in the second, he goes tougher and cooler. Here, they let tough, cool Ash roam free for a whole movie, and let me tell you, it is not boring to watch. The first film was magnificent horror, the second was pretty good horror and very cool action... how else to proceed than to basically drop the horror and go for ultra-cool action? That's what they did, and let me tell you, they most certainly succeeded. This film is even more 'guy' and entertaining than the second film, though I didn't care much for all the slapstick and Three Stooges. Ash's one-liners are multiplied from the second... there's seldom more than a few minutes without him saying something corny and really, really cool(and/or doing something of the same nature). The plot is vacant, but this is an Evil Dead flick; if you were searching for anything more advanced, you should have kept on looking. The acting is better than that of the first two. The characters are well-written and credible. The humor is excellent, though a tad too much of it was slapstick, for my tastes. But when it's not, it's hilarious. The cinematography... what can I say? Raimi is a genius as far as that goes. Put that man behind a camera and he'll make dust collecting on a grandfather clock exciting to watch. The special effects are great, for what they are. The film is even more cool than the second one; remember the chainsaw? It's back. So's the shotgun. And Ash gets a new addition, too... something medieval. I won't reveal any more, but trust me, it's cool. Very. I'm very, very impressed with Raimi's vision not to mention his ability to achieve it. First he brought us a great work of horror; then a action-horror flick that rivaled the top ones in the genre; and now a medieval action-adventure. It's almost a pity that he completed the story; it would be interesting to see where else he'd take us, take Ash. What times, what genre's. But I digress. He created an amazing film here, a breathtaking atmosphere, a lot of entertainment and loads of cool action. I watched the Director's Cut of this flick, containing the so-called(and aptly named) Apocalypse Finale, after which I watched the S Mart Finale. I can definitely recommend the Director's Cut complete with its ending, but the S Mart one definitely ain't bad, either. Get it and watch it if you dug the second, or even the first. Any version. Chances are you'll love it just like I did. I recommend this to fans of the franchise, Raimi, Campbell, cool action or medieval adventures. Any guy will most likely enjoy or even love this movie. Check it out. You'll certainly not regret it. 10/10"

","Now anybody who has seen the first two Evil Dead movies, is already throughly confused about what is going on (unless you pick up that the first segment of Evil Dead 2, is supposed to cover the first movie, then expand on it, so no, for once Ash wasn't stupid enough to go back to that cabin, even though the case says he does). So no surprise that the ending of Evil Dead 2 is slightly changed, to goto the beginning of this, but not by much. Anyways... This movie kicks major deadite ass. With more great one lines than you can shake a stick at, this movie delivers everything you want. While it takes care of the horror early (the pit scene, the she-bitch scene, and the part where Ash is running from the ""Evil Dead"" in the force) this shouldn't disappoint fans of the first two. This is the single most quotable movie ever, I tend to say when somebody tells me I'm being a jackass because I won't give them something I respond, ""Good, bad, I'm the one with the____."" Definitely great, while Bruce Campbell isn't the best actor in the world, he sure does a great job as Ash, and nobody, not even ASHTON KUTCHER, can replace him. Anybody who expects this movie to be a horror movie, is so far from wrong. It was/is meant as parody of movies like Jason and the Argunauts. Now I have to put in my two cents about the different endings of this movie. 1) Original Ending: Really like this ending, and usually watch it with this one (as I have The Boomstick Edition), but the thing is, if Evil Dead 4 isn't made (which it reportedly is) it is a big let down for the fans, but it is exactly what Ash would do, the thing is I saw this ending first and I thought ""Hail to the king, baby"" was one of those famous lines that was never said, so you miss that one. (Another line that I like better in the Theatrical cut is ""Good, bad, I'm the one with the gun."" As opposed to, ""I'm not that good baby."" In this ending Ash takes one too many drops, and sleeps an extra hundred years, waking up in a post apocalyptic world, which makes 100% sense with they way things have been going in (as I have guessed, about a span of 4-7 days, Evil Dead 1 night, Evil Dead 2 continues it to the next night, then Army of Darkness is like, two days to five days) this particular week. Great, has one line that I absolutely love ""Ha ha, manufactured products"" just the way he says it makes me crack up. 2) The S-Mart Ending: Very funny, very flashy, very Hollywood. I think for this movie, and what it was trying to do (make fun of big Hollywood epics) this made more sense, but in the sense of the series, made sense, but not as much as the original. What you get here is Ash kicking more Deadite ass, and getting the girl. So go out and buy this, NOW! DON'T MAKE ME SHOVE MY BOOMSTICK UP YOUR ASS!"
"dee.reid","10","2","3","3 October 2005"," Can they be stopped, the ""Army of Darkness""?
","If chins could kill Â– ""Army of Darkness"" is director Sam Raimi's insanely funny and action-packed (and presumed) closer to his ""Evil Dead"" trilogy. Chaos reigns supreme in this third entry, with smart-alecky demon-slayer Ash (Bruce Campbell) being magically transported back to the medieval ages. Between his flirtations with local maiden Sheila (Embeth Davidtz), battling the evil deadites including his clone Evil Ash and Raimi's penchant for gut-busting manic hilarity (which often places Ash on the receiving end of a proverbial foot in the a**), we get what is very easily one of the most innovative horror movies ever envisioned. It's clear Raimi and company are having a blast here; ""Army of Darkness"" has become the director's pre-""Spider-Man"" signature piece, and has made Campbell the cult icon he became under Raimi's guidance. The one-liners fly, boomsticks blast, laughs are plentiful, and ""Army of Darkness"" remains an unquestioned masterpiece of slapstick horror-comedy."

Lucky for him he has a chainsaw as an arm and a shotgun because the Deadites (walking skeletons) are out to enslave everyone. Sam Raimi takes the slapstick horror of the Evil Dead and goes way over the top with it, with great success. Think Three Stooges fighting dead skeletons and you'll get the idea. If you're a fan of The Evil Dead you have to see Army Of Darkness. It sounds absolutely ridiculous but it's very funny and clever. I don't know what category this movie is in, but it's groovy."

","Ash, from the first two Evil Dead films, is still trapped in medieval times. It seems the only way to return to the modern age is by the use of the Book of the Dead. Unfortunately it is also sought after by the deadites, the leader of whom has taken on the identity of Evil Ash. Alright, so aside from a few plot references, this is more of a follow-up to Evil Dead 2 than a sequel. But there is a lot more to it, and the story of Ash's quest to find the Book of the Dead is a genuine parody of dark-fantasy type films.<br/><br/>Incidentally, there are at least two different endings to this film.

Bruce Campbell gives the performance of his career as the one-liner shouting Ash.The plot takes place after the events of Evil Dead II,Ash is sent back in time by the Necronomican to the Middle Ages,and is mistaken for a promised one from the skies to lead the people against evil.Ash isn't a hero,heck even his creator Sam Raimi doesn't say so.You love Ash because he is a different type of hero.He works at a sleazy department store,he likes his normal routine and he doesn't want to be involved with the deadites(the monsters Ash fights) He wants to get back to working in the Housewares Department at S-Mart.We can easily say Ash is a hero close to home.He is what we'd be like in these situations.He eventually has a good heart under all the one liners and cocky attitude.When being offered to be sent home to leave the people in the castle to die,Ash knows he can't do this and pulls through for them.Most of the Bruce Campbell/Sam Raimi fans know that this is the third entry of The Evil Dead trilogy.The original Evil Dead has to be admired after reading about how the film was made,it was extremely low budget to the point where cans of dog food were used for body parts.Yet you look aside and the film is an effective horror masterpiece among the greats.Army of Darkness is nothing like Evil Dead,in fact the horror element is completely gone except for the deadites.The film is an action/comedy/horror hybrid.As a fan of the original Evil Dead I was not disappointed in the outcome,you will be entertained in a different way than Evil Dead.<br/><br/>10/10"

Combining his trademark camera style with his off the wall writing, director/writer Sam Raimi (Spiderman) makes his first big budget feature film one to remember. Raimi proves once again that he loves to beat the living crap out of Bruce Campbell. Campbell's character Ash fully shines with his best dialog and action sequences yet.

","The third movie in this Evil Dead trilogy.<br/><br/>You see a clear growth in the film: From a bad acted film with almost no money and very creative camera-work to this big money action film.<br/><br/>Raimi puts the setting in a different land and age, presumably because the wooden cabin had grown too small for this big production. Raimi keeps the humor and the one-liners in the movie but it is sometimes a little too much. He wants it to be too funny sometimes and it becomes more slapstick then the two other films were. Nonetheless this movie isn't a bad movie. It has a high pace, enough humor and the character Ash is fantastic.

","Sorry dude (you who said i missed the point about army of darkness) but i think you missed my point, i most certainly am aware of the fact that Army of darkness is supposed to be a humorous adventure/fantasy flick with obvious intentions to parodies them old fantasy movies. But I thinks it's not only supposed to be just that, in my eyes it's a great continuation to Dead by dawn and i have nothing against it taking the humor of the precursors a step further. But i also love the animations (obviously inspired a lot by Harryhausens work o movies such as ""Sinbad""(triology) and ""Jason and the Argonauts"") for more than the humorous value, I love it simply because i love that sort of animations. And I sure as hell know it ain't suppose to be a very serious movie like LoTR!!<br/><br/>I actually think you've missed the point if you only see it as a parody which has nothing to do with Evil dead 1 and Dead by dawn! I'm not saying that that's the case but it almost seems like it...<br/><br/>What i meant by great scenery wasn't some joke i sincerely think so, the studio feeling gives me great satisfaction because it brings me back to when i was young, growing up with Conan, Sinbad and so on. And that was what i meant by a great feeling in it. And maybe it's all meant to be a joke but i love it, every second of it and fact that you so obviously can tell that they are in a studio and the clay animations (the skeleton-scene is almost a direct rip-off from Jason and the Argonauts!)is wonderful!<br/><br/>At least we can agree that it's a great movie and the alternative ending is super! <br/><br/>Now to the movie! You who have seen ""Evil Dead"" and ""Evil Dead 2 - Dead by dawn"" knows what it's all about and the third movie picks up where Dead by dawn ended: Ash has traveled back in time and is now a slave, but after showing what he's made of in ""the pit"" he sets out on a dangerous journey, looking for the Necronomicon knowing that finding it is the only way he will ever get home, back to his own time again. But it's not easy, an army of the dead and a lot more is in his way! will he make it?<br/><br/>Hope you'll enjoy it, i know i did!<br/><br/>/Sven"

","When i first saw Evil dead i was sold! The first movie is almost a pure horror movie but with a few laughs in it. The second one and the third one (Army of darkness), takes the humorous side of the first film even further and Army of darkness is almost entirely a comedy. But i still love it, not only for Ashes(Bruce Campbell) wonderful one-liners but because of the scenery and the feeling of it. It's like visiting an other world. A great magical world!<br/><br/>As you might not know Ash takes a trip back in time to set things straight in Army of darkness. In this mystical world he meets a lot of different weird creatures and he must now make a great journey to find the solution to all their problems and end this Evil. but will he succeed?<br/><br/>Maybe this movie alone isn't the greatest movie of all times, might not even be one of mine favorites but since i have seen the whole trilogy and loved every second of the two first movies i can't dislike this one. It might not be a horror movie but it works perfectly as a continuation to the first and second part of the trilogy and it is a great movie! At least i think so!<br/><br/>Before watching this movie you must of course see the two first movies: ""Evil Dead"" and ""Evil Dead 2 - dead by dawn"" to get the full experience!<br/><br/>Hope you enjoy it!<br/><br/>/Sven"

The next 40 minutes consists of Ash rallying the troops to defend the castle and the Book within from the Evil Dead,and giving some Frame-by-Frame skeletons a bloody good smashing.<br/><br/>Army of Darkness is a departure from the Evil Dead and Evil Dead II in that there is far less gore,and the movie exudes a campy feeling in every moment of seriousness. This is less a tribute to Evil Dead and more about the good IL harry hausen films of yesteryear.<br/><br/>The movie is hilarious and engaging as a pure back in time/fight the undead story,but Bruce Campbell breaths life into it as his ever-growing character Ash.Such witticisms as 'come get some' and 'gimme some sugar,baby' are liberally sprinkled throughout the dialogue to highlight the camp feeling in moments of seriousness,and bring us back to the point - which is laughing.<br/><br/>Is it a comedy?

","Bruce Campbell returns as the hapless hero Ash in this third instalment in Sam Raimi's exceptional Evil Dead' series. In Army of Darkness' Ash is transported back through time to 13th Century England where he must yet again do battle with the evil deadites if he is to ever stand a chance of being transported back to his own time.<br/><br/>Continuing the comical feel that Evil Dead 2: Dead By Dawn' so brilliantly executed and now almost steering clear of any horror aspect, Army of Darkness' is nothing more than a stylish comic romp with the usual sheer brilliance of Sam Raimi's unique direction. The story, albeit far-fetched, plays perfectly and very little of the movie fails to entertain. There are some obvious plot-holes but unlike the original, and to a small extent the first sequel, this is not in any way a serious movie but in fact a well thought out and well scripted comic fantasy. Having said that there are still many horror elements to the movie, but they are there more for the comedy rather than to shock or scare. Fans of the previous movies will be treated to an Evil Ash, an army of skeletons and the typical deadites that we came to love (well you know what I mean) in the first place.<br/><br/>Bruce Campbell is at his zany best as Ash, once again delivering his one line catchphrases the way only he can and unlike the previous two movies he is aided this time around by a relatively strong supporting cast including Embeth Davidtz in an early career role as the female lead Sheila. Campbell and Davidtz seem to share some type of special on-screen chemistry which makes their interactions with each other throughout the movie all that more distinctive.<br/><br/>Once again the viewer is treated to some top notch special effects and inspired direction which come together magnificently to produce the wonderful Army of Darkness'. Despite perhaps being overly camp at times and being rather distant from the beginnings of the series I personally rate Army of Darkness' as one of the better movies of the 1990's and would recommend it as an accomplished and different second sequel. Not much horror but as a horror-comedy fantasy it's hard to beat! My rating for Army of Darkness'  7.5/10."

","First off, I would like to say that I thought Evil Dead was a really scary horror movie which deserves a spot in any horror fans top ten list. Evil Dead II was also pretty good, although a little ridiculous. The third installment was just no good.<br/><br/>Comedy and horror do not mix. They do on occasion but not when they start of as horror and descend into comedy. I have seen this happen countless times with other films. Freddy Krueger started life as a fearsome boogeyman but his later films resembled black comedy. The same happened with the Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Childs Play films. Evil Dead was an extremely creepy movie where you were waiting for something to jump out whilst Army of Darkness was too much of a comedy.<br/><br/>I can live with Ash being transported back in time. However, this was far too comedic. It's perfect if you haven't seen the first two films but if your pants were scared off watching Evil Dead I and II then this film is totally unsuitable for you.<br/><br/>Horror needs to remain horror. Could you imagine if the likes of Michael Myers, Jason Voorhess or Pinhead turned into comedy characters? Army of Darkness was disappointing and if the rumours about a fourth Evil Dead movie are true, I hope it is better-and much much scarier-than this one."

","I hope director Sam Raimi is not finished with the Evil Dead series. Sure his Hercules and Xena Warrior Princess shows are doing great, but nothing is quite like his Evil Dead Series.<br/><br/>Army of Darkness takes us to medieval times (a continuation of where Evil Dead 2 left off) where Ash has become known as the promised one who will rid the people of this time of all the dead that have risen from the grave.<br/><br/>This film was called 'Army Of Darkness' because this was the first Evil Dead movie that had a wide theatrical release. They didn't want movie goers skipping it because they hadn't seen the previous two. It does stand by itself, but I would recommend following the whole series. They changed the beginning of this film a bit from the ending of the Evil Dead 2. Where in Evil Dead 2 Ash falls through the rip in time, and is instantly saluted as the promised one, he is now thought to be an enemy. He has to prove himself to the population first.  Unfortunate, but I'm sure it made a better storyline. <br/><br/>The rest of the movie is a classic horror/comedy. Sam Raimi has invented an entire new genre with the Evil Dead series. It's a fun movie that has clever little things inside. For instance the chant 'Klaatu Verada Nicto' taken from The Day The Earth Stood Still. H. P. Lovecraft's Necronomicon, and copies of Fangoria magazine are all little things that made this movie fun for me.<br/><br/>This is the American version however, and was altered. The main difference was the ending. The ending was too depressing for U.S. audiences according to the movie studios, so they changed it. That is unfortunate. Hopefully they will release the international version."

","Ok so its no Citizen Kane but still think that this deserved more praise then it got. The critics dislike this because it was different from the previous films, which is true. I have yet to The Evil Dead and Evil Dead 2 Dead by Dawn maybe when I do see these films my view of this film will change. Ash is transported to 1300 AD when he goes through a wormhole like thing. To get back to his time Ash must get the book of the dead and say three magic words. Ash forgets the last word but takes the book as the result he awakens the army of darkness also known as the deadites. Ash decides the people to fight the deadites because they refused to send him home. The film makes great use of fantasy and humor; the film is more comedy then horror unlike the first two films. If you are looking for a horror film this isn't for you but if you want a funny fantasy adventure film this is for you. Short run time, plenty of action and laughs makes this film quite watchable even if you don't like it. An exciting, entertaining and fun fantasy adventure comedy; though some of the special effects are campy the comedy makes up for that.

You see, I was just talking the other day with someone who was deeply offended that Sam Raimi released Army of Darkness, and that it was an insult to the whole Evil Dead Trilogy.

"aidanratesmovies","8","1","1","6 May 2020"," My favorite of the bunch
","Funny, entertaining, and absolutely ridiculous- Army of Darkness may not hit home on every front, but it is certainly the best film in the franchise. The film is largely held superior by Bruce Campbell's larger than life performance, which is both hilariously over the top, and incredibly entertaining and stupid to watch (in the best of ways). The film takes a much different approach, for the most part, than the previous installments, which some may call as a fault, but I think it is what makes it so uniquely enjoyable. The film works best when it is doing its own thing, instead of relying on the messy timeline of the films before it. The gags and visuals are quite enjoyable, although some do not hold up super well today (mainly the skeletons). The films pacing is far greater than the other films, providing a solidly entertaining, and very odd ride, that is enjoyable from start to finish. The films biggest flaw is when it relies on previous film ideas too harshly to a fault, and relying on miscommunication tropes, and formulaic attributes to tell its own story. Best said, it is better when it is being original, instead of when it is not. In the end, Army of Darkness was a surprisingly enjoyable third installment in a film franchise I never quite enjoyed as everyone else, but i'm glad I enjoyed this one. It's often very funny, amusing, and so ridiculous it's hard to take your eyes off of the screen.
My Rating: 8.25/10"
"gbill-74877","4","1","1","16 April 2020"," Too silly
","I like how Sam Raimi didn't just trot out another cabin movie per the usual kind of horror film formula, and I also like how he wasn't afraid to retell the ending of the last movie when setting up this one. I really hoped to like this one more, given what I thought was a creative transition back to the year 1300. His special effect work is pretty cool as usual, and I think my favorite moments were when the false books attack. There are also all sorts of homages in here which were interesting to see, e.g. the stop motion animation work of Ray Harryhausen with skeletons in Jason and the Argonauts, Errol Flynn as Robin Hood, and the Three Stooges.<br/><br/>For me though, it just wasn't my kind of film. It shifts the tone of the previous movies from horror/comedy, with emphasis on the horror, to action/comedy, with emphasis on the comedy - and the comedy is too damn silly for me to find funny. The film seems to go out of its way to be stupid, having the main character say cheesy lines like ""gimme some sugar baby"" before having sex with a woman he's met, and all sorts of other bits that I groaned over. The story and action scenes end up being pretty standard too, certainly not keeping up with the special effects, though I have to say, I loved the ending."

","'Evil Dead.' The original 'video nasty.' 'Evil Dead II.' The half sequel, half remake, three quarters reboot of the original 'video nasty.' 'Army of Darkness.' The sequel to one ending of the remake of 'Evil Dead' which sort of follows on, but also kind of creates a new continuity which then gets erased depending on which version you watch and then how you interpret what follows in 'Ash vs The Evil Dead.' Confused yet? It doesn't matter. Basically, if you're a fan of cheesy horror-comedies (or just love Bruce Campbell as much as I do) then you'll have a blast with 'Army of Darkness.' Despite 'The Evil Dead' franchise's 'liberal' attitude to continuity, no one seems to care. That's probably because its fan-base is just so damn loyal that they forgive these frequent lapses in story-telling and simply enjoy the films (and now TV show) for what they are - dumb, silly - and very, very gory - fun.<br/><br/>'Army of Darkness' carries on this tradition. Yes, you probably should have watched at least 'Evil Dead II,' but this (sort of) third instalment will hardly punish you for not knowing its entire back story. Basically, a man gets trapped in medieval times and has to fight his way back to the present. However, it just so happens that the man in question has just so happened to have a lot of experience in slaying disgusting monsters and manages to do it without the use of a hand and an array of dry quips (and a shotgun - that comes in pretty handy, too). Yes, it's none other than 'Ash,' played effortlessly by Bruce Campbell.<br/><br/>If you've never heard of Ash/Bruce Campbell, it's actually quite hard to tell where one ends and the other begins (assuming they're different people to begin with). He's certainly not your average hero. He's definitely not politically correct and fits perfectly with the whole 'Evil Dead' feel of gore and gags. It never takes itself seriously and delights in spraying more unnecessary pints of blood all over the screen for as long as possible (most of which ends up on Bruce one way or another!).<br/><br/>I suppose if you're completely used to 'modern horror' and like your films 'dark, gritty and realistic' then you may hate 'Army of Darkness' (and the whole 'Evil Dead' vibe). The special effects are pretty cheap-looking (not much computer-generated effects here, mainly blue screen and practical effects). It's hardly scary, choosing self-knowingness over true horror. But it certainly is disgusting. And great fun. There's a reason why the 'Evil Dead' films have stood the test of time (and why its dark and gritty remake of 2013 is barely worth talking about). 'Army of Darkness' is a shining example of a great film that can be made without the need for a massive budget (although, compared to the original 'Evil Dead's' budget, I guess 'Army of Darkness' was 'expensive!'<br/><br/>Hail to the king of B-movies and the whole 'Evil Dead' franchise."
"classicsoncall","6","1","1","30 June 2018"," ""I say we stay here and fight it out!""
","I can understand how this film wound up a cult classic but it did very little for me. It's difficult to categorize what genre it's in, as it combines elements of horror, sci-fi, comedy and camp, along with a lot of farcical nonsense. So maybe that's the appeal for dyed in the wool fans who have watched it over and over again, judging by it's positive reviews on this board. I have to admit though, the concept was cleverly outlandish, taking a modern day housewares clerk and transporting him back to the medieval ages along with his car and a chainsaw. Lots of possibilities there, but then it degenerated into a lot of downright silly battles against evil demons and a whole host of skeleton warriors. I guess that's where the Army of Darkness comes in. Without acknowledging it's origin in the 1951 sci-fi classic ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"" (one of my favorite movies by the way), our hero Ash (Bruce Campbell) is given a secret password to retrieve a deadly scripture known as the Necronomicon. However it sounded to me like the second word in the phrase 'Klaatu, Barada, Nikto' was changed to something like 'Verata', or at least that's the way I heard it. The original usage of the term in the earlier movie was also used as sort of a password to let a supporting character advise an alien robot that it's Master Klaatu was in trouble. In retrospect, now that I think about it, the usage of 'Klaatu, Verata, Nikto' here might have meant the whole picture was in trouble. (But in a good way for all you loyal fans.)"

Its possible to divorce the experience from the franchise and have fun with it, silly and irreverent fun with a Saturday morning cartoon feel to it. Campbell is suitably ostentatious as his new, one-liner spewing self and the physical comedy on display is enjoyably impressive, as well. In its series context, though, it loses all the grit of the prior titles and, as such, the mix between horror and humour is incredibly imbalanced.

But from the filmmakers perspective, it's a lovable piece that wears its cheapness on its chest. That's a wire, there's a green screen, that's a voice over on a plaster skeleton standing in place. It's so endearing.<br/><br/>The cheapness isn't what makes this movie fun for me, it's how much fun the actors are having. Bruce Campbell is a joy to watch, spouting one liners and having plaster skeletons thrown at him from off-camera. The extras waving their swords haphazardly are having a blast, the director is, the stars are, and it translates to a big dumb smile on you, the viewers, face.<br/><br/>I don't have to explain this movie to you. Most likely, you've already seen it. If you haven't, you're missing one of the best B-movies of all time, a spoof of the sword and sorcery genre disguised as a silly horror movie disguised as an homage to the Three Stooges."
"andrewnmiller","10","1","1","14 August 2017"," Hail to Bruce Campbell and Sam Raimi, baby.
","Following my viewing of Evil Dead II, I was so pumped to watch the final installment of the Evil Dead franchise and sure enough, it didn't let me down. From start to it's ending, Army of Darkness is a non-stop fun ride, packed with great humor, a haunting score, solid directing and Bruce Campbell.<br/><br/>Picking up where the end of the second movie left off, Ash Williams is sucked though a portal and finds himself in medieval England where he is enslaved by a local lord and is led to a castle where he is tossed into a pit and kills a Deadite and begins to form a relationship with one of maidens at the castle, but still wants to return to his own time. With the assistance of the castle's wise man, Ash learns that only the Book of the Dead has the power to spend him back, so Ash gallops off to retrieve the book, only to unleash the evil upon the people when he doesn't utter the correct worlds. Now, Ash and the remaining castle defenders must stop the Evil Dead before it destroys them.<br/><br/>When the first Evil Dead movie came out in 1981, it changed the horror genre forever and six years later, Sam gave us a sequel that was even better than the first one, now with Army of Darkness, Raimi has given us the ultimate cult horror movie and while some trilogies fail with producing a great third movie, such is not the case here as Army of Darkness is able to be a fine sequel without having to throw the quality of the first two movies out the window.<br/><br/>As with the first two, the budget is quite small at around 11 million and yet the movie still is able to build a frightening and exciting fantasy domain with impressive sets like the castle, an old windmill and a graveyard which do look fantastic as do the visual effects, showing the same level of effort and passion Sam and the crew put into the other movies and they still hold up wonderfully to this day with a mix of prosthetics, make-up, masks, and blue-screen which help make the world come alive as does the make-up on Evil Ash which is also impressively done, but when it comes to the effects in the film, nothing beats the stop-motion skeleton army which seem to have been lifted straight out of a Ray Harryhausen movie. With the budget being 10 million easily being viewed on the screen, Sam and the crew clearly had to be more imaginative and the results look incredibly real and intimidating and are able to produce a creepy and valid ambiance that is rarely seen in today's horror films.<br/><br/>The directing here in again top-notch. Sam Raimi continues to use his trademark peppy and unconventional style when filming Army of Darkness and it works a treat. One of the reasons I admire his films so much is because of Sam's unbridled ability and readiness to put the viewer's amusement center stage, not to mention his camera work here is nothing short of perfection here, making great use of fast-moving cuts and shots, while the score by Joseph Loduca and Danny Elfman is creepy and unsettling and compliments the movie nicely and Bill Pope's cinematography is simply beautiful to behold.<br/><br/>While Evil Dead 2 managed to balance the horror and comedy beautifully, Army of Darkness does add a lot more humor to the mix and while that will turn some people away from it, I feel that it works in the movie's favor. The scene of Ash forgetting which words he needs to recite when retrieving the Necromoicon and alternately hiccups on the last word and the outcome is him being eye-poked by a bunch of skeletons is truly hilarious or when he attempts to take a false version of the Book of the Dead only to be almost engulfed by a vortex or when Evil Ash has a shotgun pointed up his nose but the scene that had me laughing my head off the most during the course of the movie is where after the evil has chased Ash into an abandoned windmill then is attacked by numerous tiny villainous clones of himself that come out of a shattered mirror and they proceed to attack him by ramming a fork into his back and one jumps down his throat, truly one of the best scenes in the whole trilogy that'll have you in stitches the whole time.<br/><br/>As with Evil Dead and Evil Dead 2, all the cast in Army of Darkness play their parts well. Marcus Gilbert is incredibly straight laced as Lord Arthur, providing a candid contrast to Ash's tomfoolery while Ian Abercrombie brings a certain charm to the role of Arthur's wise man as does Embeth Davidtz as Shelia, the women who catches Ash's eye. Richard Grove rounds out the cast perfectly as Lord Henry and even Bridget Fonda and Sam's brother Ted Raimi have some memorable moments, but as with the last two films, Bruce Campbell is the reason to watch this movie. I can't say it enough how Bruce is and will always be Ash Williams, no questions asked. From starting out as a frightened pansy in the first film to being a demon slaying bad-ass, his character has matured as the movies were made and here, he is in his element as your ordinary American Joe with his shotgun, cocky attitude and one-liners, but still manages to maintain the same level of swagger and charisma that he had in the first two movies as well as continuing to give us tons of awesome physical comedy as well as showing us insensitive weakness, over-the-top scene chewing, and irregular bravery.<br/><br/>Go watch Army of Darkness if you haven't seen it already, I can't recommend it enough."

","This film is the continuation of the first evil dead movies (although it is supposed to be a stand-alone movie). This time, Ash goes to the medieval ages and must return to modern times.<br/><br/>This movie is much more concentrated on slapstick than it is on gore, which was a little bit of a downer to me because I do like my gore from Evil Dead 2. But I suppose it was done on purpose because it is supposed to be different from the other Evil Dead movies.<br/><br/>Bruce Campbell as always, gives an amazing performance as the tortured Ashley Williams. The effects, are on point, just cheesy enough to provoke a laugh. I also love evil Ash as the villain of the film.<br/><br/>One thing to mention is that in my opinion, this movie has the best one-liners from the whole Evil Dead series (except ""groovy"" and ""eat this"" from the second one).<br/><br/>I do not have a lot of problems with the film, it is just what it needs to be. A fun continuation of the Evil Dead series. I am giving it a 7/10 because this movie fails to do something different for the genre or do something mind-blowing like the first two."
"filmdescriptions","8","1","1","17 December 2016"," I Hope They Don't Make A Remake Of This Gem
","As a fan of the first two films, which introduced me to Bruce Campbell. I can say this third installment is a worthy follow up. The pit scene and Sam Raimi's name, you can't go wrong. The artwork put into a film of this caliber is fantastic. The humor of the onlookers, the spirit, and everything seems to all be there. And you are cheering Ash on with the crowd as he is fighting like a gladiator. The book of the dead, the Necronomicon is the basis of the whole film. You destroy that book and Ash would never even be in this mess. He just wants his life back. Though this film is ""S-Smart."" And it is a win! A lot of points earned for the epic battle with the ""deadites."" If anyone has read the book the ""Swan Song"" by Robert R. McCammon, you know what I'm talking about. Though this is kind of like referencing the parking lot when everybody is butting heads, it does its own thing. I am for Raimi's artistic direction and all, but things spin out of control as far as is direction. This needed to be explained to me. How Ash managed to fix his car that dropped from the sky, and then had time to turn it into a battle rig, is beyond me. Some things like this make no sense. I understand this took a while to orchestrate, or at least it looks that way, but the deadites are already dead. Why on earth would they be needing wooden shield roll-aways? they are ""bags of bones."" Anyhow, I will say this is a very original work and Sheila is a hoot. There are parts that suggest an admiration for Brian de Palma's ""Carrie, 1976"" involving her. Sheila ""got real ugly"" when she copies Carrie White (Sissy Spacek) standing in front of Ashes car. This was really my only complaint. Raimi could of thought of something better for this shot, something more original. The only difference from Carrie using her powers is Ash abandons his vessel. So she just woke up one day and was a crazed strung-out possessed zombie? Oh well, still cool. Good resolve at the end by Raimi, bringing us back to the main objective of the whole film, the book. My final thought is the whole film could be in Ashes imagination as he is working. And then he wakes up in his bed, and realizes it's all a dream. The score was interesting and I think anyone who is a fan of Steven Spielberg's, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, or Tim Burton's, A Nightmare Before Christmas will appreciate this."
"NateWatchesCoolMovies","10","1","1","4 December 2016"," getting groovy in the middle ages
","Sam Raimi's Army Of Darkness completes his demented Evil Dead trilogy in high style, and with way more off the wall humour than the first two, which made you laugh while simultaneously going straight for the jugular with gore. Slapstick seems to be the theme here, as Ash and his trusty accessories of destruction find themselves catapulted straight into the heart of the Middle Ages, where the denizens of the Necronomicon have somehow once again found him. Joining forces with a medieval King, and hopping into bed with a shapely princess (Embeth Davidz), Ash uses his modern day know-how and sassy disposition to battle hordes of skeletal beasties and flying deadites, with occasional breaks for absurd humour and near surreal set pieces. My personal favorite is when he finds himself under attack from numerous pint sized versions of himself after setting off an ancient spell in the nearby dark forests. ""Ramming speed"" they chirp as they jab him in the ass with a metal fork and giggle like demonic Borrowers. Only in these movies, man. The change of setting from a cabin in the woods to a castle allows for a much larger scale of action, involving entire armies and much more moving parts. The deadite horde has a satisfyingly creaky, Harryhausen- esque way of moving, and look great when blown to bits by the ol' boomstick as well. They also inherit the silliness and near constant mischief of the demons from the first two films too. Whether it's trees, deer heads, zombies or skeletons, anything that materializes as a result of that book just seems to have a flair for bizarre and childish shenanigans, kind of like their trademark mode of behaviour. That too is what makes these films so distinct; they're horror comedies, yes, but not in the sense that Scary Movie or Young Frankenstein is. They're like a clown with ADHD prancing about the place and destroying things in their own special and unhinged way. Different from the other films in the series, no doubt, but a welcome and very successful departure."
"MaximumMadness","8","1","1","26 November 2016"," ""Army of Darkness""- The biggest, broadest and zaniest of the ""Evil Dead"" film trilogy. Just a darned good time all around.
","Since the first entry roared onto screens in 1981, the ""Evil Dead"" franchise has been a special and important one for fans of the deranged and the ridiculously hilarious. A series built around an expert mixture of laugh-out-loud comedy and disgusting gory horror, Sam Raimi's cult classic film (and now television) series is B-movie royalty, with an ever-growing and ever-rabid fanbase. However, even with a bigger-budgeted 2013 reboot and a popular new Starz television series, perhaps the most ambitious and broad entry in the ""Evil Dead"" saga is still the 1992 swashbuckling epic ""Army of Darkness""- the third theatrical release.<br/><br/>We pick up right on the heels of the whacked-out climax seen in ""Evil Dead II""- our cynical, oafish hero Ash (Bruce Campbell) is sucked through a magical portal and lands back in time in the Middle Ages. After running afoul Lord Arthur's (Marcus Gilbert) men and proving himself worthy by battling ""Deadites"", Ash is sent on a mission to collect the dreaded Necronomicon in order to use its spells to send him back to his proper time. However, through a bit of complete idiocy, Ash not only collects the book, but also raises a massive, malevolent force- the Army of Darkness. And so, he must assist Arthur in training his men to face this vile threat, and try to stop the Deadite hordes once and for all in order to get back home...<br/><br/>The film absolutely belongs to star Campbell and director Raimi, who take their low-budget tricks and ramp them up to the next level thanks to a bigger budget and studio backing. Campbell is a B-movie god for a reason, and that is because he's just so much fun, no matter what. His amusing over-acting and sarcastic cool- guy demeanor make him just a blast and a half to behold, especially when paired with such great material. He plays Ash not quite as an ""everyman"", so much as a ""likable jerk."" He's the sort-of character you wanna sock in the jaw one moment for acting so deplorable, but then take out for a beer in the very next when he says something clever and amusing. And Campbell's definitely born to play the role.<br/><br/>Sam Raimi excels with his trademark kinetic and off-kilter style and crafts a brilliantly entertaining tale. Part of the reason I and so many others worship him is for his rampant talent and willingness to put the audience's entertainment and emotional state first and foremost in his aim... whether it be with a gritty thriller like ""A Simple Plan"", a superhero epic like ""Spider-Man 2"" or indeed a bizarre ""Three Stooges""-meets-Swashbuckler epic like ""Army of Darkness"", he commits. His keen use of brilliant slapstick humor and sharp dialog shine, and he delivers yet another creepy-yet-comedic masterpiece.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is just perfect. Marcus Gilbert plays it straight as Lord Arthur, who is a good sort-of straight-guy foil to Ash's buffoonery. Ian Abercrombie and Embeth Davidtz add a degree of class and elegance in their respective roles as a Wise Man working for Arthur and a young woman who quickly catch's Ash's eyes. And Richard Grove rounds out the cast quite nicely as Duke Henry, a sort-of rival that Arthur is strongly against, and blames for much of his troubles. There's also some nice cameos by Ted Raimi and Bridget Fonda in small but memorable turns. Add to that an amusing and wild score courtesy Joseph LoDuca and Danny Elfman, the gorgeous cinematography of Bill Pope and the creepy and eerie effects of KNB and you have just a perfect team to build this third chapter in the ""Evil Dead"" story.<br/><br/>While it may falter here and there due to some studio-mandated re- edits and cuts and the fact that despite its own excellence, it can't quite reach the insane brilliance of ""Evil Dead II"", ""Army of Darkness"" is still a very worthwhile continuation of the much- beloved cult-favorite series. It's a joy to see Ash once again, and it delivers the screams and the laughs at a mile-a-minute. And for that, I must give it a very good 8 out of 10. Hail to the king, baby!"
"tankace","8","1","1","15 November 2016"," One of the most epic small budget films of all time!
","Army of Darkness is the final installment in the Evil Dead trilogy and it was the most successful of the team grossing 21.5 million dollars and has also the most jokes and slapstick moments of the three, but by no means it isn't bad. That is something I admire with this series, as the movie had more jokes and slapstick, they became also funnier and kept their quality while doing it. <br/><br/>Another out come of this flick was that Bruce Campbell with his sarcastic, goofy and physical approach to his role, got the B-movie stardom and rightfully so, as for the director Sam Raimi well for his work about his work Sony decided that he would direct the Spiderman movie, nine years after the army of skeletons made their assault. In other words, no Army, no Spiderman and the Superhero genre we all know and love ,it wouldn't be as big as it is nowadays.<br/><br/>To the flick itself, it stands alone pretty easily for it manages to contain in the first minutes all the story line of the previous film, so everyone has the needed knowledge to figure out what is happening. As for our protagonist, Asley (HAHAHAHAHAHAHA) he time-traveled in to the thirteenth century and as it is obvious he wants to go back. The scene though a bit cheap are close enough to the real deal in order to accept them and everyone will remember who Ash go the control of the castle, ""This is my Boom-stick!!"", one of the most epic threats in movie history. And to the final battle of the garrison against the Army of the dead lead by the evil- half decomposed Ash!<br/><br/>To make justice to the battle I have to write for it separately from the rest of my analyses for the film. It is a great stop motion work with the soldiers, which is also a pretty nice homage to the fight in Jason and the Argonants of 1963. The cinematography is on point ,so when something blows up is nicely done and doesn't get you out of the rest ,like with someone else( Bayhem). Finally to the comedy during the siege is on point always fit every event is in and the one of the best insults I have ever heard ""Baby you got really ugly"" ,trully Bruce Campbell is the man.<br/><br/>As for the ending ,it is known that are two of then, in the theatrical Ash return home and ""Hail to the king"" and in the Raimi wanted to put ,he slept to much and he is now on a post-apocalyptic world. In all honesty the second fits with the tone of the movie better, but personally the first is more of my preference because ,Jesus Mr Williams has past from enough misadventure already and with it Ash vs Evil Dead could happen ,so bonus points to that.<br/><br/>All in all is an awesome film and recommended to fun of horror , comedies , B- movies and anyone alive more or less ;). Have a good one and always remember the words Klaatu Barada Nicto, in any case you find yourself in a graveyard ;)."

","The ""Evil Dead"" trilogy is among the greatest film trilogies of all time, and is easily my favorite horror film trilogy (it's actually my favorite horror film SERIES, on top of that). This trilogy combines horror and humor more successfully than any other. They're are masterpieces when it comes to entertainment and fun, and ""Army of Darkness"" is no exception.<br/><br/>It's quite different than the other two ""Evil Dead"" films, due to it having a less dark tone, and a more mainstream feel (on top of this, it's also set in a much different time period than the first two). At times, it feels much more like an action comedy than a horror comedy-but it's extremely entertaining regardless. Most of the humor comes from some of the most well executed slapstick I've ever seen, and there's also plenty of quotable lines and a great comic performance by Bruce Campbell.<br/><br/>With its brilliant special effects, hilarious dark comedy, and thrilling action, ""Army of Darkness"" remains one of the most entertaining movies I have ever seen."

","This movie must be one of the all time great action comedies. The acting stands out as he portrays a misogynistic hero type. With those chops and that chin what could go wrong. The most far fetched action adventures fully loaded with all the characteristic of the paternal archetype. This story nailed it and the plot is only surpassed by the clear lack of budget for graphics and costumes. I enjoy watching this movie over and over again.

I hope they make another just like it."
"schroeder-gustavo","Null","1","1","18 March 2016"," Cult Classic
","Army of Darkness A.K.A. Evil Dead 3 is once again directed by Sam Raimi and it's the epic return of Bruce Campbell as Ash, our hero with a chainsaw for an arm. The Evil Dead is one of my favorite movies ever and Evil Dead 2 is so different that's it's also pretty good in its own right (although I am one of those weirdos who prefers the first Evil Dead). While the first film in the series was going for a campy horror tone, the second one was more of a goofy campy horror movie and now Army of Darkness leaves all the horror behind and focuses 100% on comedy.<br/><br/>The movie is a slapstick comedy and it never tries to be anything else. It's goofy, schlocky and it never takes itself seriously, at all. I love the set designs, costumes and makeup too. It's all pretty schlocky and weird but it's so great especially because of the movie's tone. I love the skeletons that move in stop-motion. And I really love about the first 30 minutes of Army of Darkness, it's constant laughter. After that however, after the scene Ash goes into the mill, the movie starts to go downhill. The comedy doesn't always work and it becomes very hit or miss. The story also becomes predictable when everyone thinks Ash will abandon them to die and it's so obvious that he's gonna stay and fight. The battle feels way too long (even if it's not) and it's because not all of the humor works. Oddly, I found so many similarities between The Two Towers and Army of Darkness. Many shots and set designs of the castle during the battle looked pretty similar to the battle of Helm's Deep in Lord of the Rings. Also some of the things that happen are very similar: like Henry's army arriving to save the day when all hope seems lost. It's like when Gandalf shows up with the Rohirrim.<br/><br/>Anyway, Army of Darkness is certainly not a great film, I probably wouldn't even call it a good film but it works (for the most part) and there's a reason it's become a cult classic by now. Bruce Campbell is amazing and delivers some of the best one-liners ever and it's just a movie that has so much energy. It always puts a big smile on my face."

","I didn't have a whole lot of expectations for this movie. All I knew was that it was a really good comedy, which after watching I can verify that. <br/><br/>Army of Darkness isn't a horribly plot-driven movie. It's clear that the humor is the primary focus, and it does it quite well. The plot never stood out as being particularly bad or horribly rushed because it was very clear that that was the intention. But nevertheless, it was still did feel rushed at points and some parts felt like they could have been drawn out a bit more. <br/><br/>The characters aren't anything worth mentioning. The main character just exists for cheesy one-liners, and everyone else just to provide information on the plot. Once again, it's clear that this is the intention and for the most part it works pretty well. <br/><br/>The humor in the movie is great. It's full of goofy stuff from the 1990s, as well as lots of great cheesy moments. It's often over the top to the point of goofiness, and everything else is just as goofy, especially the one-liners.<br/><br/>Overall Army of Darkness is a whole lot of fun to watch. While it's not superb, it's very intentional, and its obvious that this is the case. In the end I'd certainly recommend this movie to anyone simply looking to zone out and have a good time, because this movie is just that."

I love how he is just your typical guy who doesn't give a damn about anything or anyone but wants to try in saving the world. I began to watch this film last night as I saw that the quote in the movie ""Hail to the King baby"" was copied into the Duke Nukem games. Heck I even thought Duke Nukem from my childhood originally said that with his own words but, unfortunately he copied other quotes from different movies. Ah well, who wouldn't like him, he's awesome!<br/><br/>I liked how this movie was set out including a different era altogether. You would never think it was part of the Evil Dead movies, except Bruce Campbell and the cabin that appeared a little at the beginning of the movie!

And yet, here is Army of Darkness and it's one of my favourite movies of all time. While the horror is there, painful mutilation and things from the nether regions of hell appear in pretty much every scene, it's the comedy that shines through.  I laughed my ass off, and much of that has to be credited to Bruce Campbells performance as much as the writing and direction. Despite the weird and wonderful situations he finds himself in, our reluctant hero battles on with a handy wisecrack and his chainsaw fist.<br/><br/>Highpoints have to be the over-the-top battle scenes against hordes of undead and skeletal warriors, who are obligated by movie history to look and move as if Ray Harryhausen had animated them.  Ash and evil Ash battle it out across medieavel ramparts, wisecracking all the way and kicking record amounts of ass.  Low points for me are some of the out-and-out horror scenes at the mill, but since I'm no fan of horror that's not surprising.  I am willing to put up with a little of it though, if it means I get to watch a movie that is as much fun and as full of action as this one.  Cinematic candy?

More interesting is that the book now lies on a cemetery and Ash will have to retrieve it in order to manage to get back into present time! Well the movie would have been a bit shorter if the book have been teleported right with Ash. Well let's believe this!<br/><br/>Ash, also has a chain saw instead of one of his hands to fight the creatures which terrorise the medieval kings and knights.

What really draw my attention on the army of darkness, was the ""over the top"" aspect of the movie, in other words: It does not get any worse then this. The old stile of making these very bad special effects is somehow more interesting then the now-days horror movies. In the time of The evil deads, the crew was working really hard on making it look as good as possible, and they succeeded. the army of darkness looks more like a slapstick kinda flick instead of the first evil dead that scared the hell out of me, being a young boy back then.

","MILD SPOILERS!!!!<br/><br/>The question is often posed: ""Why is a film of such dubious merit so beloved by so many people?""  The simple answer is is that ARMY OF DARKNESS is just so much fun to watch.  It remains director Sam Raimi's campy throw back, a film that preserves the traditions of B-grade cult classics and Ray Harryhausen's stop motion special effects.  It exudes such delight at the act of making a movie, of telling a story, it is hard to resist.  It is not a great film but it is an entertaining tale complete with an army of skeletons, knights on horseback, foul demons, a beautiful female lead and a Delta 88 Oldsmobile.<br/><br/>ARMY OF DARKNESS opens with the ending of EVIL DEAD II, which sees Ash (Bruce Cambell) deposited in the middle ages via some kind of magic portal (the actual physics on this are a little sketchy), only to be enslaved. He is eventually released to seek the infamous book of the dead, which has the power to purge evil from the kingdom forever.  This journey is perhaps the highlight of the movie.  As Ash wanders through haunted grave yards and battles miniature duplicates of himself, the full scope of the film's comedic intentions are developed.  All this leads to the climactic battle sequence with the forces of the undead (although some of the magic is lost when so many of the spring boards used by the stuntmen are plainly obvious). Will evil rule the day, or will good etc, etc.<br/><br/>The charm of ARMY OF DARKNESS falls mainly on the shoulders of the main character, Ash.  As portrayed by Bruce Campbell, he is a square jawed dolt, who as Raimi says ""...would looks up to an imbecile.""  It is this quality that makes him instantly likable.  He is arrogant, loud, angry, and dumb. Ash is supplied with puerile one liners (""groovy"", ""come get some"", ""gimme some sugar baby""), that you can almost imagine this guy practicing in front of a mirror on a Friday night.  He's a jerk but we like him all the same. In the end he proves to be a hero, which considering the complete lack of character development, is oddly satisfying.<br/><br/>ARMY OF DARKNESS will also live on as a film that was not given a chance to live up to its full potential.  Due to a situation over the rights to the sequel of SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, on which producer Dino De Laurentiis and Universal Pictures clashed, Raimi was left with little money to complete the film.  So little in fact, that they could not afford main titles, instead using the rather lame animated opening sequence.  The lack of funds also resulted in composer Danny Elfman writing the 'March of the Dead' theme (that was meant to be used under the main titles; see above) for one dollar. That, as well as massive studio interference which saw entire scenes cut and the ending reshot completely.  However, the situation has been corrected with seemingly dozens of DVD releases, each more comprehensive than the last, which allows ARMY OF DARKNESS to live on beyond the truncated theatrical version.  ARMY OF DARKNESS has all the makings of a cult classic, so give into the silliness and check it out. 8/10."

","The first time I saw this movie was at a screening of Evil Dead, EDII and AoD. After the completion of ALL THREE, who should walk on stage but Bruce himself for a hilarious question and answer session. His answer to when EDIV might come out ""It will come out...when monkeys fly out my butt!"" It seems that Sam Raimi took particular delight in torturing Bruce throughout the trilogy (mostly in EDII and AoD).<br/><br/>As for AoD, it is easily my favorite of the three. It is hilarious from beginning to end, with the obvious 3 Stooges references to the more subtle spoofs of earlier movies such as the Disney flick ""Bedknobs and Broomsticks"".  Yes, the effects are cheesy and the castle is a matte painting but WHO CARES?  I'm sick of movies with bloated budgets and computer-generated actors. Not everyone has a 100 mil budget to work with and Sam Raimi was making this on a shoestring budget (for the time).<br/><br/>Possibly the funniest scene in the film is Ash versus the mini-Ashes in and around the windmill. This is NOT a scene to be missed and fits perfectly into the topsy-turvy world that Ash has fallen into and now has to get himself out of. Bruce Campbell is quite possibly the quirkiest actor in the business (yes, even quirkier than Johnny Depp!).  He has no hesitation about doing small parts if they're interesting (""Escape from LA"" and ""Spiderman"", notably) yet has the presence and talent to carry off leading roles with penache.<br/><br/>More power to you Bruce and may AoD live forever!"

","I'll never forget the first time I saw Army of Darkness. It was on one afternoon on Sci-Fi channel when I was about 8. I thought it was funny but didn't truely enjoy it until I rented it in high school. This movie is a comedic gem of the 1990's. Ash is one of the greatest on screen characters in recent history. Bruce Campbell, although not the best actor in the world plays Ash perfectly. The movie is full of smart*ss comments from Ash to the townspeople, deadites, and anyone else who steps in his way. The ending, which is pretty much a low budget Helms Deep from LOTR:TTT, is a spectacular ode to old stop motion films such as Jason and the Argonauts. This is one of those films that our kids can turn on in 20 years and still get the jokes and gags.

","Well, I love it. It is so appalling that it's good! Surely that's the whole point of it. The entire film is nonsense and any connection with the two earlier films is purely accidental.<br/><br/>Bruce Campbell is wonderful. He's one of my all-time heroes and this film is his piece de resistance. Surely he added all of those incredibly funny one-liners as he went along? You couldn't script such rubbish! The scene where he splits into Good Ash and Bad Ash and fights himself is hilarious, as is most of the rest of the film.<br/><br/>Personally, in the same way that I think Tim Burton made a mistake calling his film 'Planet of the Apes', I think it was a mistake to call this film 'Evil Dead III'. I can see why they did but I think people then watch with an expectation, one that this film certainly will not live up to. It's about the unscariest film I've seen - and so does my nine year old grandson, who thinks it is hilarious. It's his favourite film."

","What happened here? I don't quite understand how this works...<br/><br/>Two fantastic, disturbing, and fun horror movies shocked and amused us at the same time, The Evil Dead and Evil Dead II. Evil Dead II left us with an amusingly unfortunate and suggestive ending, Ash got sucked into the portal and found himself in medieval times.<br/><br/>Okay, so he's in medieval times, it does leave the expectation that the next movie would be more of an 'adventure' than a horror, but this still isn't quite what was expected. Instead we got this strange comedy 'spin off' if that's what we can call it, Army of Darkness.<br/><br/>If you haven't already guessed by the fact that the title doesn't even include the words ""Evil Dead"", this is going to be very different...<br/><br/>The problem is, although a very entertaining flick on its own, especially for somebody who hasn't seen the original Evil Dead movies, this movie hardly bares any resemblance to the original 2 films. Ash is a different character alltogether, his cowardly behaviour and developing insanity are gone, and have been replaced by a one-liner spouting superhero who likes to say ""baby"" a lot. There is no gore at all. There are only 3 'deadites' or possessed people from the original films and they are all at the start(the only part which had even a remote resemblance to the original 2 films) the rest of the movie is filled with living skeletons with English countryman accents.<br/><br/>I'm sorry to sound harsh about this film, but you just don't think Evil Dead when you see a man's face stretched out of proportion like a cartoon and shaking it back into shape.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong though, this is a good movie. It's thoroughly entertaining. Just try to forget it's an Evil Dead movie. Don't be expecting an ""Evil Dead 3"", because it doesn't work as one, which is probably the reason why New Line insisted there was no ED3 in the film's title. The relationship it shares with the original ED movies is pretty much the same as ""Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare"" shared with the ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" movies. It involved the characters, but it was different, and pretty much just a big joke.<br/><br/>It's best to see Army of Darkness as a fun flick made to answer the people who wonder ""Wouldn't it be funny to see what actually happened to ash in medieval times."".<br/><br/>As I said in my summary, it's like The Three Stooges meets Willow and The Mask. It's a fantasy adventure, with cartoony out of proportion slapstick humour."

","Some people may think that these movies (Evil Dead, Evil Dead 2, Army of Darkness) were intended to be scary.  Well, um, duh, not really.  Yes, they are horror themed, and if you were truly scared by any of them, well, that means you haven't seen a real horror film.  So I'm here to state that these three movies are meant to be fun.  You can't find better B acting with a better B plot.  The original Evil Dead was made on a college budget.  Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell both attended Michigan State University and filmed it as a film project.  With the two follow ups, Evil Dead 2 (which is not a sequel, but a remake) and Army of Darkness are sort of poking fun at horror movies.  Completely worth watching if you are a true horror movie fan. These three, including Army of Darkness have become Cult Classics for a reason.  Why else would they release 50 (yes, an exaggeration) different special edition DVD's?"

Now it has descended into a farce, a farce that had me laughing so hard I had trouble breathing.  From the title ""Bruce Campbell vs Army of Darkness"", you can tell what kind of movie you're in for.  The skeleton army looks ridiculous and the special effects used were the worst I've seen in decades, and this whogivesacrap attitude about the whole movie is what makes it work.

","Army of Darkness completes the Evil Dead (Sam Raimi) trilogy - where we find that Ash, the hero, has been transported back to the Dark Ages in England where he accidentally unleashes a huge ""Army of Darkness"". This movie is completely different (in my opinion) than the previous two - there is much more emphasis on slapstick than schlock (see The Evil Dead). More comedic - this film reminds me a lot of the Three Stooges sort of painful slapstick stuff. Ash (Bruce Campbell) is portrayed as a witty action flick movie star (it works!) where he is seen taking on the evil hordes whilst flicking off one-liners a la Arnie style. Even though the movie is only 80 plus minutes long - it tends to drag around two-thirds the way through.

So I'm probably part of the minority that thoroughly enjoyed part 3 over it's predecessors. Why? Director Rami was beginning to graduate into a more polished film maker by this time with less of the rough edges that were in the first two (many may rightfully debate that this is part of their 'cult status' appeal). And Campbell had many moments that proves he's 'leading man' material. His acting is much more assured and FUNNY in this one.<br/><br/>So at $12.99 plus tax for the 'Official Bootlegger's Director Cut', just couldn't pass it up. Love that original ending (equally love the 'reshot' ending too!). Miss that ""I'm the guy with the gun"" line though.

It's simple, it's short (at only 81 minutes), it's entertaining, it's funny, it's a solid popcorn flick. Raimi mentioned his intention was making something identical to ""Jason and the Argonauts"" and flicks like those.  I personally am not a fan of that film and unfortunately had to watch in my high school Latin class (I think I fell asleep through most of the film).  But the action scenes in this movie are very engaging and the character of Ash has been transformed from wimpy anti-hero into comic book hero, equipped with his killer chainsaw and campy sayings.  That ""jack-s**t"" line is absolutely marvelous.  I haven't checked the memorable quotes section yet, but hopefully it's there.  I also loved the scene where Ash was fighting with Embeth Davitz's character, now possessed and looking like a monster.  She says, ""You used to think I was beautiful.""  Ash replies, ""Honey...you've gotten a lot uglier.""  There's a good deal of hilariously campy one-liners like that, which made me smile with delight.  <br/><br/>*********SPOILER AHEAD**********<br/><br/>Some say that the alternate ending would've worked out better, but with an energetic action extravaganza like this, I think not, though the alternate ending was pretty nifty and made me laugh.  But I'd much rather it end with Ash battling the demons at S-Mart in the present day.  If I were in a theater, that would be the moment I'd start cheering.  Besides, it came unexpected.

Now he has to find the Book of the Dead to stop and army of Deadites from awakening and destroying a kingdome. As you would have guessed, he accidently unleashes the Army of Darkness. What I liked about this film is that the blood wasn't really exaggerated, except for the start of the movie. From then on, it was seemingly realistic blood and gore, and not a lot of it. The acting has improved by ten points this time, even from Bruce Campbell, making him the best of the bunch. This movie was bizarre in it's own little way, but not as much as Evil Dead 2. There were times that you'd laugh because it was so stupid and wierd, and other times when you'd laugh because it was funny.

When they realized they weren't getting it, they went for a half-serious, half-comedy idea. For this one, I think they had about $300 to do the movie, and went for an all-out comedy movie. They succeeded in making one of the worst movies I have ever seen, but made it hilarious at the random, and unexplained jumps and objects in the movie.

And Army of Darkness or Evil Dead III or whatever you want to call it (apparently there are five or six different titles) is like the three stooges with evil flesh-eating dead things. I consider this flick an homage (pronounced in that fancy-pants European way) to the artistry of the Howard brothers (not forgetting, of course, the efforts of Mr. Fine).<br/><br/>I howled every time I watched it.

Some viewers complain about Bruce's acting style, but it's totally in character with the rest of the film. As a bonus, we're treated to an early glimpse of Embeth Davidtz, who of course went on to Schindler's List and a turn in another great subversive film, Matilda. The homage to Ray Harryhausen in the finale is great. I had a friend complain to me that the special effects in the movie were great up until the Deadite battle, which he considered cheesy. I think he missed the point. This is a fun movie, pure and simple. Sam has moved on to bigger things, and turned into a ""serious"" director, which is a shame.

Based on the original ""Evil Dead"" which was more horror based with great camera work, Army of Darkness continues the story line with ever increasing cleverness.

The movie is fast paced and very funny. In a way, it's not for the same audience who liked the first two movies, but it's still great."

","This movie is a must see. It is a classic. If you have ever seen ""The Evil Dead 2: Dead At Dawn"" then you'll understand where ""Army of Darkness"" came from.However, Army of Darkness is SO MUCH better than The Evil Dead 2!!! I would classify it as a ""fantasy/action/comedy"" movie rather than a straight up horror flick.<br/><br/>In fact, one gets the impression they started filming The Evil Dead 2, and by the end they realized that their idea worked better as a comedy. (The Evil Dead 2 actually gets pretty funny towards the end and it shows the birth of Ash Williams (Bruce Campbell) as a modern day action-hero. A shot gun strapped to his back and a chainsaw for an arm. It just doesn't get any better than this.<br/><br/>Plus you get to see the classic Evil Dead ""Shaky-Cam"" (when two people strap a camera to a board a run through the woods fast a hell.)<br/><br/>Its one of the most entertaining movies I've ever seen.

","Put simply, this is one of the best action-adventure films ever made. Bruce Campbell is absolutely awesome in this flick. He's the model superhero: funny one-liners, fast moves, a great shot, and a ladies man; what more can you ask for an action film like this. Campbell's Ash makes Indiana Jones look like Mr. Rodgers! Campbell isn't the only great element for this movie. You got great medival backdrops, horrifying monsters, and great special effects. The other actors, especially the lady who played Sheila (I forgot the actresses' name!) portray their roles convincingly well, too. ""Army of Darkness"" is a great film to watch on Halloween night, even though this movie isn't really that frightening, but it will give you chills up the spine. So make way for the ultimate action-shock fest: ""Army of Darkness!"" Hail to this king, baby!!!!"

"JW-30","9","1","1","20 July 1999"," How to make a cult movie
","Many movies have been touted as cult movies and dissappeared as quick as their hype. This one shows how a real cult movie is made.<br/><br/>First: don't take yourself too serious. Even, no, especially with comedies. Little is more awful than an comedy that seriously tries to be fun. This movie is fun not only because of the script, the screamingly funny one-liners and the excellent goofball macho acting by Bruce Campbell, but because you can feel the fun the whole team must have had during making this one.<br/><br/>Second: take a handful of excellent, but under-rated actors. According to the motto ""lots to win, little to lose"" they give much more intense performance than actors with a reputation.<br/><br/>Third: money is not that important. Freedom is. The Effects look sometimes cheesy, but they are fun nevertheless. What elsewhere would have been a blooper adds to the fun here. And the more freedom the production crew gets, the more creativity and details they put into the film. Of course, this very nice and fun movie could have been the box office hit, but forgotten afterwards - the rules of what cannot be done and what has to happen for a hollywood production are also the rules of how to make boring movies. If Producer, Author and the crew don't care much for those rules, you get movies like Dark Star, El Mariachi and this one.<br/><br/>Third: Stay in peoples minds. After you've seen it many times, you still should enjoy it the next time. It doesn't matter how you get this done; make it so people keep remembering the movie. AoD manages with its humour and some pictures you can't get out of your head.<br/><br/>So this is a cult movie. A cult movie cannot by definition be everybodys piece of cake, so you may find it boring. But else, believe me, you find yourself quickly not only liking, but loving it. And that's the last point: polarize.<br/><br/>Everything else has been said. Have fun. (And I am not closing with a quote! :)"

In the end I would have to say that if most horror films followed the same method of not taking itself too seriously than it would probably help such movies as I know what you did last summer and Urban Legends."

KNB proves themselves with some terrifically unmatched F/X sequences.  Campbell is in fine form, showing that Ash is the ruler of the universe.  He obviously knows how to save the day, no matter the circumstances.  All of the performances are top-notch and, better yet, the script is in good shape.  I've read it.

The greatest director of all time (Sam Raimi) has done it again with some great visuals and a lot of style in the making.

","If anyone can view this film and then say to me that Sam Raimi is not an ""auteur"", I'll cram the entire Evil Dead trilogy down their throat.  Sam's movies are always fun and visually unique, and Army of Darkness is no exception.  Here, Bruce Campbell's Ash character becomes a sort of wise-cracking action hero, as opposed to the zombie punching-bag he was in the earlier films, and the focus of the series shifts from comedy-horror to supernatural comedy-action.  The film is a total trip from start to end, and Raimi's oddball camera tricks coupled with Campbell's over-the-top performance add to the fun.  Also listen for some great one-liners, which have been ripped off in other media (Duke Nukem, most notoriously).  A must-see for anyone who likes total escapism."

","Simply amazing. Pure, unadulterated, almost guilty cinematic fun. Sam and Ivan Raimi's character Ash from the Evil Dead series returns in this sequel. After being sucked into a time vortex he finds himself in medieval, feudal Europe. Ash faces trial after hysterical trial, from poker-wielding mini-Ash's, to a ""Bad Ash"" alter ego (""Good, bad, I'm the guy with the gun."") as he quests for the Necronomicon to rid the world of the evil and send him back to the 20th Century. The over the top, ultra-macho yet hilariously inept Ash is perfectly played by Bruce Campbell. The wild, frantic and funny script is flawlessly complemented by Sam Raimi's ultra-kinetic cinematography. With Army of Darkness, Raimi shows that he's a true auteur with a definite style that exponentially enhances the narrative. He's having fun, and so do we. All in all, it's a filmic treat that never ceases to entertain and be so much fun, it almost shouldn't be legal."

Bruce Campbell (TV's Hercules: The Legendary Journeys and Xena: Warrior Princess) returns as the macho and offbeat hero Ash, not only armed with a ""boom stick"", but one-liners as well.  Unlike the first two ""Evil Dead"" films, this third installment has no gore.  Instead, it references classics such as ""Jason and the Argonauts"", ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"", and ""Gulliver's Travels.""  Also, the soundtrack is cool; especially Danny Elfman's ""March of the Dead.""<br/><br/>Picking up where ""Evil Dead 2"" left off, Ash gets transported back to 13th century medieval times surrounded by a bunch of ""primitive screwheads.""

""The Book of the Dead"") and must correctly recite the magic words ""klatu, verata, nektu"" or the dead will wake up.  He fails and has to deal with the walking skeletons.

Lines like ""Hail to the King Baby"" and ""Good, Bad, I'm the guy with the gun"" and ""Who wants some?"" make this movie great.

Joseph Loduca's score is dynamic and sweeping, containing many great themes; especially 'Building the DeathCoaster'. (There's also a theme made by Danny Elfman, The March of the Dead).

","The third movie in the Evil Dead series, Army of Darkness doesn't quite live up to its predecessor, but is a very good movie in its own right. Sucked into the past after the events of the movie, Evil Dead II, Ash finds himself in Arthurian England. In the midst of a war between two kings, Arthus and Henry the Red, Ash is mistaken for one of Henry's vassals by Arthur. He eventually proves that he is not one, and that he has technology superior to either side in the form of his Boom Stick. He then must find the Necronomicon in order to return to his own time. A hilarious movie in many ways, but in no way a horror film, Army of Darkness deviates far from the Evil Dead series. Bruce Campbell does a wonderful job as the ever tortured, and ever egotistical  Ash.

Big time movie buffs will appreciate AoD's throw-backs to earlier cinema (""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" and ""Jason and the Argonauts""), and the amusingly uncharacteristic casting choice of ""Schindler's List""'s Embeth Davitz as Sheila, Ash's love interest, but there is enough in this impishly clever flick to make it a must-see for anyone looking for funfunfunfunfun!!!!

It delivers and it delivers it hard, shunning out any other B-movie that I can think of. It stars the underrated Bruce Campbell as the one-line-spitting-shotgun-blasting-chainsaw-hacking Ash Williams. This movie, being one of his only starring rolls next to the other Evil Dead movies, is creative and funny. It isn't as gory or scary as the first Evil Dead movies but keep in mind it also has a completely different plot. The first 2 were located in a cabin in the woods and this one is located in a barren area in medieval times. Theres not much that I can find that bothers me about this movie except that the end of Evil Dead 2 is different than what is shown the beginning of Army of Darkness. The end of Evil Dead 2 shows Ash saving people from a flying beast and the beginning of AOD shows him as a slave, but you can't let that ruin the movie. It is a great movie and my favorite at that and I look forward to Campbell starring in a leading roll sometime soon. RATING **** out of ****"

","Spoiler alert! What a groovy film! Having seen the previous 2 Evil Deads, I was expecting something like the second one- but it was nothing like! We pick up, as the second one did, on where we saw Ash last- dumped in the medieval desert with only that damn car, a double-barreled Remington shotgun, chainsaw and his wits to help him out.  From here on in, what we know from the first 2 films hardly applies- only slight gore, no zombies barring Sheila's possession (which we hardly see) and no trees. But this film wasn't intended to be a retread of what had gone before. Instead, we get a prototype of 'The Mummy'- the Brendan Fraser one. There's so many fantastically funny, quotable lines in this that the duller, 'gayer' parts-and ropey effects- can be excused. 'This is my BOOMSTICK!', or 'Klaatu, berada, Ni-(cough)!', or 'You'll die in the graveyard before ya getit!' However, having seen 'The Mummy' before this, I was left feeling that 'Army' could have been of the same quality, if not better. It just feels like it lost its way, sad considering Bruce Campbell rocks so hard, the lines are great, the comedy holds its own blah blah.. If there had been a tighter plot, with a better use of Danny Elfman's score (no big music over the battle, but over Ash preparing his car! WHY?

I cant think of a single person who doesnt like that film, and the lines that live long after the film has finished(""groovy."", ""look whos laughing now!"" etc.). Evil Dead III was somewhat of a disappointment. I guess I was expecting another EDII, but it was not to be; The gore which supplemented the humour and made it special was taken out and replaced by just plain stupidity, like the stretched face scene.

","I saw the series in reverse... AoD then DBD then the original. The movies just got funnier. Evil Dead 1 was just a B Grade Horror movie, but in Evil Dead 2 Dead by Dawn, you could tell that the tongue was firmly in cheek. I consider this to be the original because I didn't get what the 'Thing in the woods' was until I saw Evil Dead 2.<br/><br/>Army of Darkness has all the qualities of a cult classic, and is easily one of my favourite movies of all time. The way that Bruce Campbell plays Ash is outstanding. He is like a cartoon character in the way he expresses his emotions and his one-liners are superb.<br/><br/>Not only did this movie inspire the game Duke Nukem 3D it inspired Doom, after all it was Ash who was the first guy to run around killing zombies with a chainsaw, shotgun and sheer coolness."

It starts off showing the end to Evil Dead 2 (Which also is a great movie!)when Ash gets sucked into the portal and transferred to medieval times where he is sentenced to die in the pit(a classic scene).He proves he is worthy in the pit and asks the wiseman to teleport him back to normal time.

Well, you would be forgiven for thinking so.<br/><br/>The amazing thing is that this is, quite simply, one of the best films I have ever seen.  It is also probably responsible for setting up a new genre, that of ""comedy fantasy horror"".  The unfortunate thing is that the original ""Evil Dead"" movie became so associated with the ""Video Nasty"" tag in the 80s, that anything attached to the franchise tended to be avoided by anyone except horror fans.<br/><br/>This is a real shame, because many people who would have otherwise enjoyed the film immensely, were put off by the association.<br/><br/>All I can say is, that as a person who is not a great fan of the original Evil Dead movie, this is one film that I have watched an unhealthy number of times, and will continue to do so."

Bruce Campbell cracked me up with his strings of hilariously macho one-liners, and everything is dark but taken very lightly to provide an amusing entertainment.  Some scenes are gory, but that's part of the fun because it's done in such an obviously silly manner.  For one, try shooting a shotgun over your shoulder while looking at the opposite direction!!!  But the funniest and most rewarding scene has to be the end sequence in the supermarket.

It's easy to se why these films are loved even after all of this time. From an actual character arc (i.e. Ash goes from wimp, to sorta-wimp, to one bad mofo in the course of 3 films), to great special effects, and camera work that will knock your socks off, this is truly a classic.

Like Evil Dead and yes, Evil Dead 2, this movie has the familiar Ash, only this time he's got a chainsaw arm and read to kick some undead booty. With legions of skeletons and all sorts of other horrible things, this combines a sort of medieval feel with the beseiging of a castle with a hilarious futuristic hero with swift one liners such as ""Groovy"", and ""Swallow this"" (in reference to a remark made by a zany ghost thing.

"bonjerke","10","1","1","22 October 2001"," A great movie that is often misunderstood.
","I remember seeing Army of Darkness for the first time nearly two years ago. I immediately became obsessed with it and the other films as well in the Evil Dead trilogy.  While Evil Dead is great, and Evil Dead II has its moments, it is Army of Darkness that stands at the head of the pack and deservedly should be recognized as the greatest B-movie of all-time.<br/><br/>The genius behind this film is that it appears to hypes itself up to be some great horror masterpiece but is really a comedy instead(just read the back-cover of the movie before watching it and you'll see.)  Every cliche that is commonplace in bad horror movies is made apparent in Army of Darkness, yet the movie does nothing to disguise itself from the fact that this was done on purpose to ridicule the common faults of bad horror movies.<br/><br/>I love watching people complain about this movie. ""That isn't possible, there is no way a belt can knot itself around a chain like that"" or, ""How can he shoot off 32 rounds from a shotgun without reloading?""  People who mutter these comments often miss the point of the movie.  Those things were added on purpose.  YOU ARE NOT SUPPOSE TO DISSECT THIS MOVIE AND TALK ABOUT WHAT IS AND ISN'T POSSIBLE.  You are supposed to just sit back, forget about the laws of nature, and enjoy the great one-liners by Bruce Campbell(God of B-movie actors) and the hilarious and idiotic plot created by Sam Raimi. This is a movie about pure entertainment, not dramatic and artistic values.<br/><br/>In this way, Army of Darkness is often a misunderstood film.  People try to look and find substance when substance isn't there to begin with(which is the reason people love it in the first place.)  If you have never seen this film, go out and watch it as soon as you can.  However, as I have warned you above, don't try looking too deep into it.  Just sit back, get ready for some cheesy lines and a plot made out of velveeta, and enjoy."

","There's a lot of fun stuff in this movie, especially from Bruce Campbell (the quintessential King of Camp), and Sam Raimi is definitely a talented director, but it doesn't quite compare to the previous movie, Evil Dead II, despite its bigger budget.  I think the problem is that the fun and charm that made Evil Dead II so good comes off pretty forced and more obvious in this movie, especially with the cartoony sound effects and Campbell going REALLY over-the-top as Evil Ash and the Tiny Ashes.  The best stuff was with the army of skeletons (brought to life with puppets and stop-motion animation) bickering with one another.  I only wish that they could have been stop-motion in the fight scenes and not stuntmen in cheap suits."

","Ash has carved himself a niche (as well as a few witches) as a cult hero, and Army of Darkness is the vehicle that really is what Ash is all about. Whilst Evil Dead was one of the best horror movies ever, and Evil Dead II was one of the best movies ever, Army of Darkness is the best Ash ever, so come and get some.<br/><br/>I see no reason to go into the plot of this movie as it really is secondary to the outlandish humour, slapstick and fun, so much so that the fact that there is a plot makes it even more funny. You could get away with a lot when you have Bruce Campbell as your star - his mere presence on the screen makes you laugh sometimes, and his one-liners are priceless.<br/><br/>Ash works for S-Mart, in housewares, but as soon as he is called upon to save the world from the deadites again, he can ride horses, is a master of martial arts, is deadly with a shotgun, and can swordfight also - this is what I call pure escapism, and brilliant.<br/><br/>Get the lads around with a crate of beer, and watch this movie and I guarantee you will love it - except if you look for reality - of which there is none, and why should there be - it's Ash after all.<br/><br/>Army of Darkness - a masterpiece of unadulterated comedy that makes no claims to be anything other than a vehicle for the excellent Bruce Campbell."
"benjohnt","9","1","1","29 August 2001"," Hilarious horror-comedy fun.
","Army of Darkness is the third in Sam Raimi's 혩The Evil Dead' trilogy. Previously, the films were aimed at a select group of viewers; those who could stomach the gallons of blood(and occasionally, bile) splattering across the screen. They turned out to be extremely popular with this audience; to the extent that this latest effort has much improved financial backing. This turns out to be a mixed blessing.<br/><br/>In order to be commercially viable, the movie needed to aim for a wider audience. Thus, the gore is toned down greatly, which will disappoint those who enjoyed the slapstick brutality of the first two films. However, the increased budget does allow for more extravagant visual effects during the fight scenes. In my opinion, they enhances their entertainment value- more than the lack of blood shown on screen diminishes it. Another consequence of increased funding is that the film has a much grander scale to it than either of the previous Evil Dead films. This is mainly due to the more impressive sets, as well as the hundreds of extras involved.<br/><br/>
I thought the script to this movie was hilarious. I particularly liked Bruce Campbell's mean-spirited, but witty, anti-hero Ash. His disregard for the feelings of others is evident from the beginning of the film, as he addresses the medieval populace as `primates', ridiculing their `primitive intellect'. I found seeing a character such as this in a main-stream movie refreshingly amusing, especially with Campbell's performance.<br/><br/>
The supporting characters, while given relatively little screen time, were expanded well enough for me to care about what happened to them. Once again, the emphasis is on humour; I thought some of the character's mannerisms were hilarious. Such as King Arthur's method of taking his sword from a `sword boy' squatting in front of him. He grabs the handle offered to him, and stomps the servant to the floor. His subject falls backwards, keeping hold of the scabbard and thus removing it from the blade.<br/><br/>
The plot itself often makes little sense, but it doesn't take itself so seriously that this is a problem. Some of the less believable moments do actually add to the comedy. For example, Ash finds a conveniently placed book entitled `Steam Plant Operation' in the boot of his car. With the aid of a medieval-age Blacksmith, he then uses the information in the book to construct a steam-powered engine for the vehicle.<br/><br/>Unlike 혩Evil Dead II', this movie follows on from the events portrayed in the film preceding it. In a neat twist to the continuing story-line, in 혩Evil Dead II', Ash read a history of what happens in 혩Army of Darkness'. Little did he realise that later, he would be sent back in time and that he was reading about his own future.<br/><br/>To conclude, I found watching this movie to be seriously fun. While there are no life changing lessons to be learnt here, I thought it worked brilliantly as a piece of humorous entertainment. 9/10."

","Bruce Campbell is captivating (read: decapitating) as ever in this great sequel of Evil Dead 2.  He plays the arrogant hero with unsurpassed facial acrobatics.  'Army' is less experimental, shows off it's big budget and has totally different brilliant action scenes that kept me laughing (hysterically pounding with my feet on the ground).  It has a more solid plot (no matter which version you choose), better actors than The Evil Dead (doesn't actually matter, because Campbell rules anyway, especially when he's on his own), eviscerating art direction, a walnut stock, cobalt blue steel and a haired trigger.<br/><br/>But seriously: it was the first movie in the series that I saw ('94) and I was immediately caught up in Raimi's web.  Moreover, I can't resist any movie which features Bruce Campbell since Army.  They both blow the Evil Dead concept to almost epic proportions here.  Cinematographer Bill Pope gloriously continues Peter Deming's stunning work on Evil Dead 2.  E.g. the 'Ash/little Ash' scene in the mill is fabulous.  Unfortunately, the hard-core experimental b-movie appeal is (almost) gone with the arrival of Dino De Laurentiis.  Still, you can call me in the middle of the night to watch it again anytime.  The ultimate recommendations after seeing this one should be Chinese Ghost Story (1987), Braindead (1992) and of course Evil Dead 2 (1987), although The Evil Dead (1982) started all the fun of course. Oh, and the terrible waster Evil Dead Trap (1988) has NOTHING to do with this one.<br/><br/>More serious (far-fetched) recommendations about guys trapped in the wrong time/system are: Catch-22 (1970, Nichols) and Brazil (1985, Gilliam) and maybe even Kafka (1991, Soderbergh), Le Procès (1963, Welles).

","Army of Darkness plays out like a sick, existential nightmare of a tangled protagonist's web of inner demons, set up against the backdrop of a premise that all to gladly parodies itself in the name of good comedy; but backfires as the premise gets water thin; and the audience is left to wonder if horror movies have embraced laid back nostalgia as a substitute for sheer terror and dauntless tension.  As compared to Raimi's ""The Evil Dead"", this film plays out like a sick and syrupy snow cone that's been allowed to sit out on a late summer afternoon, on a porch, for a little too long.  As a result, it is a nauseaus mess, at times.  I still enjoyed the symbiotic interplay of the characters, and the story and dialogue should keep any enlightened existentialist glued to their chair, and the movie runs at a breakneck pace, and brings back fond memories of fond times past, in a good-natured, devil-may care, David Lynch awe-inspiring way.

The rest of ""Army of Darkness"" however is dull and silly! Okay, Bridgette Fonda has a cameo appearance and Bruce Campbell is as great as usual, but if you wanna see real funny horror trash comedies check out Frank Henenlotter´s ""Basket Case"" or ""Frankenhooker"", as well as ""Mother´s Day"" or Peter Jackson´s ""Bad Taste""."

Anyway, all the stupid spirits and stuff are presented being very idiotic and brainless in the film, instead of scary and sadistic. The acting is not impressive, i would say effective, like the direction. The two endings are nice, although i prefer the original, the best one is the second(spoiler) in which ash gets in the nightmarish(!!) near(!) future. What else?

","Army of Darkness is a film that concludes the Evil Dead series.  The previous two films were excellent examples of classic horror comedies, but lacked something that Army of Darkness has.  In my mind, I think the classic one liners of Sam and Ivan Raimi put the icing on the cake.<br/><br/>Army of Darkness is a film that touches upon good versus evil.  You may be saying that this plot has been covered many times before.  Even though this is true, Army of Darkness puts a spin upon this that, in the end, will have you wanting more.  Ash is the hero that is sent back in time, in Evil Dead 2, to the time of King Arthur.  Ash needs to win the respect of Arthur, capture the book of the dead, defeat the army of the dead, and get back to his own time period, the 20th century.  While trying to accomplish these objectives, Ash spurts out classic one liners, endures a tremendous amount of pain, and entertains the audience to the maximum.  I ask everyone to at least give this movie a chance.  GO to your local Blockbuster, and pick it up.  You will not be disappointed.  In the end Ash will have you muttering his own words.

It is rife with film references that only a true geek could appreciate, on top of that it parodies everything from ""The Day the Earth stood Still"", ""The Wizard of Oz"", ""Jason and the Argonaughts"", and more than anything else, the previous two Evil Dead Films, that are truly Cult Classics.<br/><br/>Bruce Campbell's ""Ash"" who appeaed in the two Evil Deads, is the archtypal Alpha Male, shotgun wielding, with a chainsaw for an arm (literally), and over-done chisled looks which almost mock the notion of what makes a good looking man.<br/><br/>Ash thinks he is control, which often leads to his undoing. Especially when he finds himself in 13th century england after being sucked into an odd vortex at the end of Evil dead 2. The inhabitants of the realm find themselves plagued by the ""Deadites"" an army of undead warriors brought to life by the same evil force which has inhabited the settings of all 3 films. The run-ins with these creatures culminates in an climactic battle between humans, skeletons and Ash's mutilated clone.<br/><br/>Only Ash has the ability to defeat these monsters, but how will he get back to the present? A little Hocus Pocus, wouldn't hurt.<br/><br/>If you want to see an excellent film taht will make you laugh... go rent ""Annie Hall"".

","This is perhaps my favorite watchable movie of all time. It's always fun, always a laugh, and totally enjoyable. Though I think that the viewer is best served by watching all movies in chronological order, AoD also works as a fine stand alone movie, which is how I first watched it.<br/><br/>Bruce Campbell and Sam Raimi's sence of slapstick makes it the funniest thing since Blazing Saddles in the comedy genre, and the special effects were for the time the most complicated use of animatrons. With a falling out of animatronics for use in crowd scences, it'll probably remain a unique landmark.<br/><br/>The best part, I feel, about AoD is the fact that it's good for watching over and over. I usually can't stand movies a second time around. The buildups become tedious, the relationship conflicts trite.

Some people say this movie is scary, but it is absolutely not.  It's a good action flick with hilarious scenes.  If you like movies that are one part action and one part comedy, then you'll like this.  The funniest parts of the movie are when Ash gets beaten up or made to look like an ass.  This movie focuses more on all this c**p that happens to Ash, a clerk at a typical Wal-Mart like store while he has no idea what the hell is going on.  It's one of those movies where the main character you feel sorry for, but not for long because it's so hilarious (like in ""The Big Lebowski,"" one of my other reviews).  This is a good movie for, if you're a kid, to bring to a sleepover because there are absolutely no boring scenes, it's all just good action and comedy.

","Army of Darkness brings the Evil Dead Trilogy to a close (for now at least) with the funniest instalment.  Evil Dead was horror with comedy, Evil Dead 2 was comedy with horror, but Army of Darkness is comedy with fantasy.  As Sam Raimi admits, it's less a homage to horror films but more to the old Ray Harryhausen classics like Sinbad or 'Jason and the Argonauts' (most obviously the army of skeletons).<br/><br/>There are numerous different versions of the film, each with their own good points, although the recent Director's Cut release is the one Sam Raimi considers to be the most complete.  This has 15 minutes extra footage beyond the American Universal release, including the original ending.  Here in England, the original release was far closer to this new Director's Cut, though there are welcome additions.  Most noticably, the battle with the 'army of darkness' is much longer and features some amusing fight scenes which were previously cut for running time.  The longer version also fills in a number of plot holes and, as Raimi points out, sorts out many of the continuity errors.<br/><br/>Opinion is generally divided on the subject of the ending.  The original American release featured a re-shot ending where Ash, back in the present, fights an evil-dead-hag in a shopping mall before finishing with the famous ""Hail to the king, baby"".  This is much funnier than the official ending and it's a shame it's not included as an extra on the Director's Cut.  However, it's easy to see why Raimi and Campbell prefer the original, 'downbeat' ending.  It fits the tone of the film better, and bears closer relation to Evil Dead 2 by ending on a cliffhanger.  It also has more interesting implications about what could happen in a sequel, should one ever be made. The one complaint I have about the Director's Cut is the replacement of the legendary line, ""Good, Bad.  I'm the guy with the gun"", with the international version's ""I ain't that good"".<br/><br/>Personally, I think newcomers to the series might be better off seeing the 80 minute version (or perhaps the international version) first, but those who've seen the first two films should stick with the more complete and more satisfying 96 minute Director's Cut."

","**WARNING** The following contains a plot summary of Army of Darkness.  If you want to enjoy the movie without knowing the plot ahead of time, do not read the paragraphs below.<br/><br/>Bruce Campbell dons the mantle of our beloved hero Ash in the third of the Evil Dead series.  This is almost a completely stand-alone movie, and can be watched without having to view the previous two.  Bridget Fonda makes an ever-so brief cameo in the beginning as his ill-fated girlfriend from Evil Dead 2.  Why make an appearance in a movie like this if you have never been involved with the project before?  As Bruce Campbell himself said, when asked the same question, ""Would YOU turn down Bridget Fonda if she asked to have a small role in Army of Darkness?""<br/><br/>The Book of the Dead, or Necronomicon, opens up a space/time gateway to medieval England, and Ash, along with his Oldsmobile, land with a thud. He is happened upon by a scouting party who mistake him for an enemy spy. After proving his worth to the nobles and peasants by fighting a Deadite in a breathtaking pit sequence, and winning the unwanted attention of a young maiden, the ""magicians"" of the court tell him that the only way to get back to his own time is to once again find the Necronomicon, which contains the needed magical phrases.<br/><br/>On his quest for the Book of the Dead, he spends a night in an old, dilapidated windmill.  Evil magic is afoot, as his reflection in a mirror takes on a life of its own, calling itself Evil Ash.  After a short scuffle with Evil Ash, Ash whips out his trusty boomstick, shoots Evil Ash dead in the face, and utters one of his famous taglines, ""Good...bad...I'm the one with the gun.""<br/><br/>Traveling on, he finally comes across his prize...or prizes as the case may be.  Ash comes across a dark altar with not one, but three Necronomicons. Remembering only part of the incantation needed to take the Necronomicon from its resting place, coupled with choosing the wrong book, Ash makes a costly mistake.  Evil Ash is raised from the dead, his face half-blown off from Ash's gunshot.  Being formerly part of Ash (his reflection), he knows what Ash knows, and knows where Ash will be bringing the Necronomicon. Evil Ash uses his dark power to raise a Deadite army, with which he will lay siege to the town and castle.<br/><br/>Ash, returning to the castle with the true Necronomicon, finds himself playing peace-maker between the locals and a neighboring town, who have been overtaken by the Deadite army.  The two factions settle their differences, and make their stand against the Deadites, but not without initial loss. The young maiden who had caught the eye of Ash, is spirited away by a Deadite winged scout, and brainwashed into joining the Deadites.<br/><br/>The Deadite army surrounds the castle, and Ash, being the ingenius hero we have all come to know, uses his knowledge to devise semi-modern weaponry to use against the Deadites, including gunpowder-tipped arrows and transforming his Oldsmobile into a battletank.<br/><br/>In the end, all is well.  The epic battle is won by Ash, Evil Ash is blown apart by a cache of gunpowder, the spell over the young maiden is broken, and the Deadites break ranks and flee.  Ash uses the Necronomicon to return home, but not without one last surprise.  A superb gem of a movie that deserved much more credit than is granted it."

","When it comes to cheesy cult cinema starring Bruce Campbell, I am a fan. Bruce has a certain panache that other actors do not have. I do not think that he would be accepted as a mainstream hero, however go into any comic book shop and ask them who there favorite cult actor is and chances are that a good percentage will say Bruce Campbell. He possesses ineffable characteristics that attract a fervent following. His characters have minimal differences like any of Clint Eastwood's western portrayals. They are always cocky, austere, and always ready for the one-liner quips. His portrayal of Ash in the Evil Dead series is no exception.<br/><br/>
Army of Darkness is the third film in the Evil Dead series. It is more silly, less gory, and more irreverent than Evil Dead II. Unfortunately, like most 'cult' films it was a disappointment at the box office and there will be no fourth film (as of yet). Army of Darkness takes place after Ash defeated the phantasm in Evil Dead II and then was sucked into a vortex that sent him into the medieval past. A slight discrepancy between II and III is that in II he shot a flying 'deadite' creature and was revered at the ending in two, but in three, he begins in chains as a prisoner.<br/><br/>
He escapes his fetters with the help of his ""boomstick"" and is sent on a quest to find the Necronomicon -- the book of the dead. This will help him get back to the future as well as rid the land of the evil curse. However, he has to say the right words before picking the book up. Otherwise, he will unleash the ""Army of Darkness."" Can Ash do this without screwing up?<br/><br/>
Raimi, who also directed Evil Dead I and II, has an eye for allusion. There are more Three Stooges references in this film then a Mel Gibson flick. He also alludes to Taxi Driver and Rambo. There is even an issue of Fangoria in Ash's trunk. Raimi's schlock sense of humor is a bizarre mix of slapstick and horror. One of the funniest scenes is when an army of mini Ashs confronts Ash and one of them jumps in the mouth of Ash and in order to kill it Ash swallows boiling water. It then mutates Ash into two separate Ashs -- on evil and one good. The banter between the two provides some ecstatically funny scenes. <br/><br/>Army of Darkness has the best use of skeletons since Jason and the Argonauts. They are an integral part of the latter half of the movie. Of course, I liked most of this movie. Sure there are plot problems and logical mistakes, but I enjoyed this film because of its originality and Campbell's character. One of the reasons this film has a cult following is because there are not many films similar to Army of Darkness. However, this film has not been accepted by the mainstream, it is embraced by a select fanatic few.<br/><br/>
Alternate Ending: <br/><br/>I am going to be vague describing my feelings on the ending. I do not want to spoil it for anyone who has not seen the movie. I have not seen the new DVD version that has many extra scenes. I am referring to the special edition Army of Darkness that has the alternate ending after the credits.<br/><br/>
Supposedly, the alternate ending was the original ending. While I enjoyed watching it, I felt the theatrical ending was stronger. While the alternate ending had a twist that was akin to its predecessor, it reminded me too much of the ending for Planet of the Apes. The theatrical ending was more aesthetically pleasing to me. I felt it was more true to the movie. It also left an opening for a sequel."

With it's over-the-top one-liners and cool action, this is one of those films that is sure to please any fan of bizarre film making, horror or even comedy.<br/><br/>What I really enjoyed though, was the character Ash.  He was just, IMO, one of the coolest guys ever to grace the big screen.<br/><br/>The downside to this film is probably that it was too short!  It was only 81 minutes!<br/><br/>4/4<br/><br/>Highly recommended"
"Wolfie-9","8","1","1","22 August 2000"," The Deadites want to kick some Ash!
","This is the third movie in director Sam Raimi's ""Evil Dead"" series, and it's definitely the funniest.  ""The Evil Dead"" was pure horror, while ""Evil Dead 2"" mellowed out somewhat.  ""Army of Darkness""... okay, sure - it's still horror; anything with an army of the dead is going to have horror.  But it's funny horror... 'Fake Shemps' (the Three Stooges routine with the skeletons in the graveyard and later with the Deadites), Ash's inability to remember the phrase 'Klaatu Barada Niktu' (from the movie ""The Day the Earth Stood Still""), his parody of the sword-wielding hero (chainsaws, anyone?), a double-barrel shotgun that fires four times without reloading, Sheila the Ash-kisser... even the Deadites themselves are funny.<br/><br/>The acting is a little wooden in spots - Bruce Campbell has said that he's gotten better with every movie he's done (and he has), but this is one of his early ones.  The stop-motion skeletons are stiff and jerky, but they're supposed to be... that's also part of the fun.  Some of the other F/X aren't as smooth as they could be, but they're easily survivable... you don't go to a movie just for the F/X anyway.  Makeup is a little patchy in spots, but that's also something that doesn't detract from the movie.<br/><br/>The plot is nothing new - ye olde 'reluctant (and somewhat inept) hero who eventually saves the day'.  Yet in Raimi's hands, it hits new heights of silliness.  Raimi has also gotten better with every movie he's done, but there are still a few spots in this where it doesn't flow quite that smoothly.  Even so, there's never really a dull moment.<br/><br/>For any of you wondering, that really is director Sam Raimi's car that Ash uses... according to reviewer/author/actor Bill Warren (he's known Sam Raimi for almost 20 years now), Raimi uses (or used) that Olds in every movie he did in the beginning - which means that it got seriously banged up on the set.  Everything you see in the trunk of the car - including the chemistry textbook - are really what Sam Raimi has in the trunk of his car... there are no product placements here.  Another Raimi touch are the 'Fake Shemps' (you have to be a Three Stooges fan to get that reference)... yet another is having his brother(s) - such as Ted Raimi - in the movie, even if they're uncredited.<br/><br/>Humor and horror might seem to be an odd mix, but it works out well - I'd recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys the Three Stooges and slapstick, or any Mel Brooks movie.  In terms of acting and plot, I give it a 7... in terms of humor, I give it a 9 - for an average of 8, which is a heck of a lot better than a lot of stuff coming out of Hollywood these days."
"johnedko","10","1","1","15 August 2000"," Definitely Fun
","When making a movie, there comes a time when you realize that the production might not be viewed as totally serious.  Some moviemakers then try to recut or reshoot scenes to make it serious, others just give up and can the project.<br/><br/>Others say ""What the heck"" and push onwards, going completely over the top and creating a masterpiece of goofy moviemaking. And that is what Army of Darkness is, a truly masterful movie that brings tears to my eyes every time I see it."

"zombizilla","Null","1","1","10 August 2000"," Good as a stand alone film, but no Evil Dead
","Army of Darkness, when looked at as a singular film, is funny as hell and of course Ash rules!  This film was released as both a stand alone and a sequel to Evil Dead II.  I made the mistake of watching this film the first time back in 93 as a sequel, and I was disappointed.  First of all, they show Ash working in a Walmart-type store.  I'm thinking to myself, ""didn't he timewarp to a medieval world with his car and a saw attached to his arm at the end of E.D. II?  Why is he here?"".  From there on, I lost all respect for what Raimi was trying to do; trying to please both E.D. fans and gain new ones with an original movie.  It just doesn't work on that level.  The lack of plot continuity threw me off.<br/><br/>But as a stand alone flick, it rocks!  Funny as hell and cool fx.  I remember when I saw this movie for the second time with a friend, he started humming the theme from ""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"" because he thought this movie was stupid.  He just didn't get it; it was, for the most part, meant to be that way, with groaner one-liners and silly skeletons.<br/><br/>If you've seen the first 2 E.D. movies, don't rent this expecting a continuation of those movies.  Just enjoy it for what it is."
"sixstrngy","10","1","1","5 August 2000"," Work of Art
","I've been watching this movie since it came out in '93.  I was in 3rd grade then.  The movie becomes better each time I watch it.  Bruce Campbell is the King of the Kings.  He rates an eleven on the ""I kick ass scale"".  I haven't seen a movie yet to top this one.  I realize that this is basically what the other 200 reviews state.  Oh well.  201 now.  I also just met Ted Raimi at a comic book convention.  He's a pretty funny guy.  He's making cameos all of the entertainment industry.  Well, that's about it."
"trianii","Null","1","1","4 August 2000"," A corny movie that's worth watching repeatedly!
","Ok, no big secret here. This movie is downright CORNY. However, its is far better than a LOT of non-corny movies that I have seen! A man from modern times is transported to medieval times, and must retrieve the Necronomicon, or Book of the Dead, to get home. Corny, but interesting at the same time.<br/><br/>The fun factor here has to be the highest of any movie I've seen in the past. Don't worry about intricate plots and confusing storylines-this film is just for laughs and excitement. It's really a comedy disguised as a medieval horror flick.<br/><br/>Although many would disagree with me, I think Bruce Campbell (Ash) put on quite an impressive display of acting. I mean, who could possibly imitate that crazed face he makes as he lops off his right hand with a chainsaw, or that expression of shock and agony (which I thought was the funniest part in the whole movie) as a nail embeds itself into his foot! Also, his one-liners are terrific. ""Good, bad, I'm the guy with the gun."" has got to be one of coolest quips ever spoken by a movie hero.<br/><br/>The undead skeletons that appear in the latter half of the film also add a great deal of laughs, with their evil-but-comical remarks. Trust me, these monsters are anything BUT frightening, but I think of it as a welcome change, and an original innovation compared to the gory, terrifying beasts of most other horror movies.<br/><br/>Overall, I don't recommend this movie to a die-hard fan of the horror genre. I do, however, recommend it to individuals who are just seeking an evening of entertainment and laughs. Trust me, don't pay attention to the corniness, just sit back and giggle. This film isn't meant to be broken down scientifically, because if it is, one can find many imperfections (firing more rounds than a shotgun can hold without reloading, falling to the ground from a high castle wall without receiving any noticeable injuries, etc.).<br/><br/>All of this said, Army of Darkness is a lot of fun to watch. Don't just listen to me, though, go and view it yourself."
"clawsss","9","1","1","21 July 2000"," I give 9/10
","Bruce Campbell is the man! He excellently portrays the reluctant hero in this film. Even though it has a different title from Evil Dead I and II, it is definitely a part III! The film does a good job of mixing humor and action, just like any good action flick should. And just like Evil Dead II, it has it's funny parts. But in the end, the hero saves the day, get's a replacement hand after losing it in Evil Dead II, and get's the girl! Isn't that what being the good guy is all about?"
"sillias","10","1","1","20 July 2000"," What can I say?
","This movie is the greatest creation of all time.  I have never laughed more, nor been more amused, by such a thing as a movie prior to my first time watching Ash shred the newly undead.  The amusement one could see worked into every scene made it just so great.  If one couldn't see that this movie exists solely to make Sam Raime laugh, then one missed the WHOLE FRIGGIN POINT.  Sit back, relax, and laugh your head off.  It's the only good thing to do, trust me!  Who cares about the sacrilige of it (I've had to deal with some people telling me how horrible all that demonic worshipping was, and how I was going to burn in hell for liking the movie)?  Just enjoy! PLEASE!"

","A friend once convinced me to watch Army Of Darkness when it first came to video.  I was sure I wasn't going to like it because I was not a big fan of the horror genre.  (Nothing wrong with horror it's just not my cup of tea). After about ten minutes I was rolling on the floor and realizing that the film was the best bang-em-up adventure I'd ever seen.  There was a level of violence so prolific is was comic.  I had to rewind it and watch it again the same night.  It was allot like the first screening of Independence Day, though I say there was allot in Army of Darkness that was much better for the budget than ID4:)"

The underrated Bruce Campbell returns to his role as Ash and gives one of the coolest performances from any movie I have ever seen.(I believe this has the best one liners of any movie ever) The plot is a continuation from the first two movies and is pretty solid. The special effects are a bit campy, but they are enjoyable. A very enjoyable film that gets my highest possible recommendation. A 10 out of 10."

It's not for everyone: if you roll your eyes at campy humor, grimace at continuity errors (how many *are* there? Count and see!), or expect flashy special effects, you may not get the proper groove out of it. It is for those who enjoy silly humor, low-budget movies, Bruce Campbell's work on TV, or for that matter TV's 'Xena' and 'Hercules', which he and the Raimi brothers have worked on. The DVD features a 'bonus' of sorts, as the Wayne and Garth types who did the special effects are interviewed."

","This movie must have the funniest skeletons I have seen in any horror movie. That plus the fact that Ash, the main character, suffers more physical abuse than any action hero before him makes this movie a must see. Don't try for a moment to make sense of this movie,just sit back and enjoy the ride and get ready to laugh you're head off with this movies array of physical humor as well as verbal gags, jokes and one-liners. This movie is silly but fun and it works quite well, unlike other movies following in its footsteps.

","Awesome movie!  Kinda cheesy, but awesome.  This movie proves that film making is not just about aesthetics, cinematography and mise-en-scene.  It proves that you can simply have FUN making a movie!!!  Who cares about the story.  Who cares about the plot.  What I care about is that this movie is just so FUN to watch! Bruce Campbell is a great actor and his one liners, which are rather immature and foolish, are hilarious.  Bruce Campbell's one liners are so funny that the people who created Duke Nukem 3D included them in the game! <br/><br/>     The Undead army of skeletons (obviously influenced by Jason and the Argonauts) are incorporated into the film very well and are animated with stop-motion photography, life size models and guys in suits. <br/><br/>     I recommend this movie to anyone.  I loved it so much I bought the special edition of it which has the alternate ending and the ""men behind the army"" special.  Now I want to get the director's cut.  Again, this movie is awesome.  It will give yo u plenty of laughs and it will be one in which you will want to watch over and over again."

The only third movie that's better has to be SCREAM 3.<br/><br/>Well, how good is EVIL DEAD III? Let's put it this way: It's groovier than THE EVIL DEAD and it's funnier than EVIL DEAD II. If you have seen the two first movie, and feel like watching a comedy, see ARMY OF DARKNESS!<br/><br/>Sam Raimi directs quite ordenal, and the action sequences are actually pretty great. The script is fabolous, funny and exciting at the same time. But most of the entertainment is in Campbell. <br/><br/>The highligts are many: Ash fighting small Ash-smurfs, Ash fighting ""Bad Ash"", Ash fighting the ordenal demons, Ash fighting the book of the dead, Ash fighting the army of darkness, Ash fighting skelletons... To make a long story short Ash fights a lot. And you have to love the one-liners: ""Hail to the king, baby"", ""Get a load of the 21:st century"", ""Come get some""...<br/><br/>

","This movie was so tacky, so repulsive, so brainless, that is was beautiful. If taken seriously may leave the wrong impression.  This film is the pure definition of a Cult Film, and was probably one of the most enjoyable experiences of poor taste in all of my 19 years.  You'll laugh so hard, you'll scream, you'll scream so hard you'll laugh.  If you like this film, then of course see its predecessors the ""Evil Dead"" flicks.  Some of the fight scenes reminded me a little of the ""Princess Bride"".  In the words of ""Ash"", the film was ""Groovy""."

","The first time I saw Army of Darkness, I really didn't like it because I was actually expecting a George Romero type zombie film.  However, I have seen it plenty of times since and now consider it one of my favorites. !!**THIS CONTAINS POSSIBLE SPOILERS**!! The reason I like it so much is because the film doesn't take itself seriously.  Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell probably knew they were making a rather stupid movie and made it laughable rather than serious. If you watch carefully, there are inconsistencies in plot and continuity EVERYWHERE.  Ash's shotgun comes out of nowhere after he climbs out of the pit, the demon climbs out of the pit even though it was crushed moments earlier, and Ash constantly fires more rounds than the gun holds.  Even the back of the box doesn't describe the plot accurately.  But you can tell that they had fun making this film and as a result it's fun to watch as well. I think it slows down and gets a little too silly in the middle, but picks up again for the ending battle.  The S-Mart ending alone is worth renting this.<br/><br/>So if you like action/horror with plenty of laughs and one-liners, rent Army of Darkness, and if you like it, check out the Evil Dead prequels. 8/10"

Rolling down cliffs, falling from the sky and hit repeatedly in the face by evil undead makes up only what the actor endured.  His character Ashe finds himself tortured terribly as he searches for a way home after his untimely transportation into Medieval times. Ridiculous stunts fill every moment of this remarkably entertaining film as Bruce Campbell spews forth one-liners that every actor attempts to attain. The camera shots are resplendid and unique.

Not to mention the fact that the success of this film paved the way for Raimi et al.'s later projects (ie, Hercules and above all Xena).

","Bruce Campbell is ultra-cool in this follow up to the wonderful ""Evil Dead 2"".

Sure, thought of as a sequel to ""Evil Dead 2"" it's a little disappointing, but I guess that's why it's not called ""Evil Dead 3"", they didn't want people to think it was another haunted cabin movie. And I'm glad they did something different instead of getting repetitive and doing the same thing over and over like other horror series. <br/><br/>""Army of Darkness"" stands on it's own as a great movie (despite annoying parts, like when Ash illogically builds a mechanical hand instead of keeping the awesome chainsaw hand he starts the movie out with). Ash is a great hero, a wise-cracking guy who's always in over his head. I think this movie should have been rated 'PG-13', not 'R', as there is no gore or anything, just a guy fighting cartoonish skeletons. It's in the same spirit as the Brendon Fraiser ""Mummy"" movie, although much more witty.<br/><br/>I guess that's all I have to say about this movie. It's good. Thank you."

Watching the films back to back its very surprising how 'advanced' the third film appears when compared to the orginal.<br/><br/>While the first 2 (espically the first one) had a very gritty feel and look, AOD is more of a big budget film and seems to be targeted to a wider audience rather than 'slasher fans'. Also the gore factor seems to be reduced from the previous film.<br/><br/>There is more jokes and humourless lines in this one and Ash is prehaps much more likable maybe due to the fact that he is both the big hero and an absolute coward at the same time. I guess it makes a change from having strong brave heros rather than ash who acts like a selfish git who cares only about himself.<br/><br/>The film also has 2 different endings depending on which country you live in...America (and some others which i cant remember) gets the happy ending while japan and the UK (and a few others) get the sad ending. Having seeing both endings I thought the sad ending was a bit of an anti climax and disappointing although it seemed to fit due to the fact the first 2 also had endings which had  Ash in a bad situation.

","It is almost unbelievable that my favored horror film (along with ""Halloween"") and my favored comedy (along with nothing because no other film can keep up to this one) belong to the same trilogy. The Evil Dead is the most frightening movie ever and Army of Darkness is just terrific. When seeing this one I became an instant Bruce Campbell fan. Why does no one in the film business notice what a great actor he is?<br/><br/>The story: After having been sent to the Middle Ages in Evil Dead II, Ash must get the Book of the Dead (""Necronomicon"") to go back to the 20th century (no fox). But he screws his mission and accidentally resurrects the Army of Darkness. Now he has to fight a horde of skeletons with the aid of Prince Arthur and Henry ""Mr. Fancy Pants"" the Red.<br/><br/>There's one reason why this movie is so fantastic: Bruce Campbell. He is a born comedy actor. The way he says his lines makes any other actor look like a beginner. This doesn't mean that the film doesn't have any good ideas on its own. On the contrary the story comes up with extraordinarily funny things. Ash doesn't only have to fight the deadites but also Bad-Ash, zombies, books(!) and little Bad-Ashes.<br/><br/>I'm very lucky I didn't listen to those people who told me that this film s...., ah, is bad.<br/><br/>My rating: 10/10 (Bruce Campbell rules, hail to the king)"

Some of these moments include when Ash(the hero) uses a shotgun almost like an automatic riffle, when his medieval girlfriend(her name is SHEILA, which I don't think existed during that era...) is captured by a flying monster, which looks like what it is: an actor in a cheap costume. Also, Ash speaks only in one-liners. Examples: ""Good, bad, I'm the one with the gun..."", and the classic "" Take that, you She-Bitch"". Overall, this movie is an horror/comedy that focuses much less on the horror part than Evil Dead 2.

I highly recommend it to anyone who's having a movie watching party and wants a flick that's a lot of fun to watch with a big group of friends.<br/><br/>There have been lots of crappy comic book movies in recent years (Batman and Robin has to top the list), and while AoD isn't based on any comic book, it is probably the best filmed version of comic book sensibilities I have seen. It's goofy, funny, exciting, while never taking itself too seriously. Bruce Campbell would be a great super-hero in any movie, and here, as Ash he's just about perfect.  Sure he's got the block chin, but besides that, he is a fantastic physical comedian, and a highly underrated actor.<br/><br/>The effects range from cheesy good to cheesy bad, but even at their worst they only add to the goofy fun.  For those looking for the horror or very black comedy of the previous two Evil Deads should look elsewhere, or at least expect AoD to be quite different.

I have enjoyed other Evil Dead series and this one is the last one for Ash to battle against evil deadites although the film plot goes in a somewhat different way from other two series. Perhaps the Army of Darkness, Evil Dead3, could be a comic and adventure film rather than horror. The amount of gore and violence is much less than the other two sequels. In particular, the army of the dead at the end of the movie reminds me of seeing an old classic legend. Besides this, the Army of Darkness is overall too funny and humorous to be a single horror flick like Evil Dead and Evil Dead II but this black comedy is surely nice to enjoy at home"

","I think that what make this film, and its two preceding films so amazing is the character Ash. Never has there been such an obscene depth of character. He goes form the depths of cowardice to the heights of heroism. You go from loathing him to loving him. From groaning to gleeful. Aside from Indiana Jones and Ferris Bueller there is no better person to take on any situation than Ash and I think that is why he is so lovable. He has the dumb luck that Jones has and then the smugness of Ferris.<br/><br/>Well the movie may have doomed Raimi's career. It is by no means a studio picture and he was forced to cut some 15 minutes and shoot an alternate ending. It's about the closest thing to Big Trouble in Little China we've seen in a while (also you should check out Brainsmasher a Love Story). But he was back with Quick and the Dead (which was a delightful intertwining of two cliche western story lines to produce something quite original). Oscar contender Simple Plan and now For Love of the Game. Is this all a ruse to lure the studios into funding Evil Dead 4? We all hope so.<br/><br/>If you like larger than life characters who kill everything, get chicks and have really awesome lines(John McClaine working at S-Mart) the you love AOD.<br/><br/>You should have seen it already!"

","EVIL DEAD was experimental horror. EVIL DEAD II just plain sucked. ARMY OF DARKNESS is a new kind of experiment. A terrific blend of action and horror.<br/><br/>The EVIL DEAD movies aren't really together though. EVIL DEAD II was kind of a remake and kind of not. (It was kind of confusing) ARMY OF DARKNESS takes place after EVIL DEAD II but kind of changes the ending of EVIL DEAD II.<br/><br/>
At the end of EVIL DEAD II Ash goes back in time and is surrounded by soldiers. They say he is the saviour that will save them from the ""deadites"" and go HAIL! HAIL! HAIL! Ash screams nooooo!<br/><br/>At the beginning of ARMY OF DARKNESS Ash goes back in time and they take him prisoner.<br/><br/>EVIL DEAD is more of an H.P. Lovecraft type story, based on Sam Raimi's test short film Within The Woods. It experiments with Sam Raimi's facination for gore effects he had since he was a kid.<br/><br/>ARMY OF DARKNESS, experiments with horror and action! And the ACTION is really a must see. Sam Raimi can even Jim Varney look like and ACTION STAR with this directing techniques! It is really a style of his own. It sort of seems like he is inspired by Robert Rodriguez because they are kind of similar but far from being the same! The cute one-liners are also a gem.<br/><br/>I actually like this one BETTER than EVIL DEAD. It's more original. EVIL DEAD II is really stupid and makes no sense. I don't like that one.

While it's still unique it fails to live up to the evil dead name.And the main reason is: 1)The writers/director ran out of ideas.

And leaves you with a result of the three stooges mixed with Monty Python's Holy Grail.

","This is the kind of movie people either love or hate. It's silly, knows it's silly, and has fun with itself. If you pride yourself on all the foreign and ""art house"" fare you have under your belt, or often refer to movies as 'films' this one probably won't be your thing. However, if you can adjust your expectations and a part of you you're not real proud of revels with glee at the sight of a man with a chainsaw for a hand blasting away at zombies and skeletons with a double-barreled Remington, this could be your lucky day.<br/><br/>Bruce Campbell, an underrated and underused actor, is way over the top as the vain, dense, almost cowardly Ash. His mixture of bravado, misogyny, and stupidity makes for some great throwaway lines. He's basically an okay guy, but can't quite get anything right. When called upon to remember three magic words (think ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"") he forgets one of them and tries to cover it by coughing, unleashing an army of the dead. Sample dialog:""Well, didst thou say the words?""...""Well, maybe I didn't say every single little syllable, but basically, yeah, I said 'em."" You get the idea. Any movie that contains dialog like ""Let's go, she-bitch"" and ""It's a trick. Get an axe"" is going to get my nickel every time.<br/><br/>Any attempt to deconstruct this film will end in heartbreak, I assure you. Go watch ""My Dinner with Andre."""
"HarmenB","5","3","7","3 February 2002"," Not really funny, baby
","I'm afraid this movie is only truly enjoyable for Bruce Campbell/Sam Raimi worshippers. It doesn't even get close to Evil Dead II, Raimi's previous movie with Campbell, when it comes to hilarious fun. Of course I had to laugh, but only for 3 or 4 times (just like the 3 guys I was watching it with), and mostly because I couldn't believe we rented such an unfunny B-movie. Besides that it's certainly not creepy or even exciting, due to the incoherent directing by Raimi. A movie with a crazy plot like this has so many oppurtunities for good jokes and 'shocking' moments, and it's really a shame that only a few are being used by the director. Go watch Evil Dead II or Braindead/Dead Alive by Peter Jackson instead if you want to see some serious over-the-top gore and fun.<br/><br/>But I have to say that there's one good thing about this movie, it somehow brought back that nice ""elementary-school-birthday-party-creepy-but-funny-movie""-feeling...<br/><br/>Rating: 5/10"

","Ash (Bruce Campbell) is thrust into midevil times to battle evil with some helping ""primitive minds"".
His boomstick, and chainsaw arm are working overtime in this classic comedy/horror film that was kicked off in the 1981 cult film ""Evil Dead.""
The cameras, facial expressions, and one liners are going full force in Army of Darkness. This is the sequel that Raimi decides to go nearly full nonsense...after dabbling with sillyness in evil dead 2.
I am a huge fan of these movies, and Campbell.
In short, Ash is training primates (who know nothing about molecular structures) to assist him in fighting countless undead subjects, (lead by his second, evil self).

","Turning ""Evil Dead"" into a long-running, crowd-pleasing horror series seems unlikely, but that's what director Sam Raimi has managed to accomplish. This second sequel is equal parts big-studio picture and giddy, gonzo bloodbath courtesy of Raimi, who clearly relishes the opportunity to paint the walls red with a significant budget, and stuffs the movie full of winning one-liners, hilarious comedic interludes and so much blood and guts that it's impossible to resist. Bruce Campbell again makes for perfect horror hero: He's chiseled like a Disney prince, has attitude for days, and does all of it with tongue planted firmly in cheek, like a horror-land Indiana Jones. This one is always enjoyable, but it's even better with a boisterous group of good friends."

It was cold and raining and my buddy thought I was full of s--- when I yelled at him to stop. He shot me a quizzical look and asked me why. ""Back there,"" I said: ""It's Sam Raimi- the guy who made ARMY OF DARKNESS."" Whereupon he informed me that I was full of s---. ""Just let me out and go around the block and pick me up,"" I begged: ""I just want to see him in person."" And he did. And I did. Then we went and saw ARMY OF DARKNESS. I warned him going in that it wouldn't be half as good as EVIL DEAD II (which we'd both loved); afterward, he thanked me for the heads up: he was better able to accept the movie for what it was (and wasn't). I've been a Raimi fan since first I laid eyes on THE EVIL DEAD, but I've often wondered if he really GETS the difference between Stupid and Funny. They can sometimes go hand in hand, but the truly FUNNY things in Life aren't usually the STUPID things (which tend to infuriate rather than please us)."
"Sandcooler","7","2","4","26 April 2013"," My least favorite of the trilogy (but still pretty awesome)
","I've always liked the serious (though I use that term very loosely) aspects to the ""Evil Dead""-saga a bit more than the comedic bits, so ""Army Of Darkness"" was definitely an acquired taste for me. The first one was a pretty straight-forward horror movie, the second one cleverly mixed bone-chilling horror with comedy, but this one is just pure slapstick. And to be honest, I still don't know how to feel about that. I laughed a lot during this movie and some scenes are just incredibly inventive (Ash fighting his evil clone has got to be the highlight), but on the other hand things are getting really self-aware now. The second one was already the sheer definition of tongue-in-cheek, but at the same time it never felt forced. This one does, mainly because Ash is such a cartoon character here. 80% of what he says is supposed to be a clever one-liner, which gets a little tiresome by the end. On the other hand though, are B-movies that much less entertaining if you know the makers are in on the joke? I wouldn't say so, and ""Army Of Darkness"" is a movie that's just impossible to hate. It's a dude with a chainsaw fighting zombies in a medieval castle, what flaws can a movie like that really have? ""Groovy""!"
"kargaan","10","2","4","24 July 2010"," Must see cult classic!!!
","Army of Darkness is without a doubt the best installment of the Evil Dead series. Army of Darkness is more or less a sequel to Evil Dead 2. But don't worry you won't have to see Evil Dead 2 to be picked up to speed to what's going on since the story so far is summarized by Ash in the beginning of the film. The Story is about a man named Ashley Williams(Ash) who goes to a cabin with his girlfriend. Unspeakable terror happens at the cabin because of an evil book called the Necronomicon and Ash is sucked into a vortex that brings him into the middle ages. Because the town their is infested by evil, Ash is asked to retrieve the Necronomicon to banish the evil. The Army of Darkness is released because of a mistake made by Campbell and it's up to him and his army to rid the town of evil. Army of Darkness is an outstanding movie even to this day. Ash is funny, his lines are memorable, and the special effects are original and astonishing. If you haven't seen this movie stop reading this review and GO SEE IT. This is one of the greatest cult films of all time!!!"

God knows had I seen the others first, I might not have even been able to make it to this one.<br/><br/>Amazingly enough, despite the fact I hated the first two movies in the trilogy, I do like this one. Sure it's corny, but it's supposed to be. I don't consider ""Army of Darkness"" to be a ""B-movie"", I think it is an imitation B-movie, and at that it succeeds.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen the other films in the series...DON'T! You can watch this one and still get the same effect. The opening moments of this movie recap the events of the last, and do so effectively so you won't need to see the other movies to understand what's going on. Trust me, you won't want to watch them. I learned the hard way.<br/><br/>On its own, ""Army of Darkness"" is a cheesy horror comedy that makes for a few good laughs. I would recommend checking it out.

"gavin6942","8","2","4","7 May 2007"," The Third in the Evil Dead Story...
","After Ash Williams (Bruce Campbell), housewares, is transported back through time and space, he finds himself in a village that must fight the Evil Dead (the Deadites). To defeat them and create a portal back to the future, Ash must retrieve the Neconomicon and face great peril: miniature versions of himself, demons and other baddies.<br/><br/>Usually a film of this caliber would not get such a high rating. The acting is cheesy, the plot rather weak and the costumes are poorly constructed (no one can possibly believe this is 1300). Even the dialog is unusual and the camera shots (a Raimi staple) are just not very solid. But somehow the film pulls it all off -- making the viewer believe that all this was done intentionally (and apparently Hollywood believed it, too, since they gave Raimi the Spider-Man franchise).<br/><br/>We get more of the slapstick humor we found in ""Evil Dead II"" and the Bruce Campbell many horror fans have grown to love. Only now he is trapped in medieval times. This is clearly the lesser of the three films (the horror element is lessened and the humor aspect raised, which I think hurts the overall feel). Yet, you'll find it hard to watch one without the other.<br/><br/>Bill Moseley makes an appearance as the Evil Deadite Captain. You can't tell it's him, and I'm willing to bet many horror fans who love Moseley are not aware of his part in this film. It's an odd paradox: ""Army of Darkness"" is probably a better loved film than ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre II"", but Moseley is better known from the latter (and now ""Devil's Rejects""). Confront Bill about this if you ever run into him.<br/><br/>Bridget Fonda also makes a very brief appearance. It's very strange... but maybe not so strange once you've seen her in ""Jackie Brown"". That Fonda clan is a strange bunch...<br/><br/>But anyway, lacking a great plot or gore or nudity or even professional acting, this film shines and will remain a cult favorite long after I'm dead. As much as I'd love to tear it apart for the critical flaws, I just can't: my love for it is right up there with the love from the other fanboys. All I can hope is that they eventually get around to an ""Evil Dead IV"" (which I guess will never happen now that they've approved ""Spider-Man VI""...)"

We were both amazed we were liking this movie so much.<br/><br/>Army of Darkness comes off somewhere between camp, comedy and action heroics.<br/><br/>I think you have to be in the right mood to appreciate this movie. For example, I love Godzilla movies, but, after drinking a beer, Godzilla can be so much more fun. Watching professional wrestling can be a lot of fun after drinking a beer too.<br/><br/>It's said, some movies are so bad, they are funny. Sometimes, I think, movie makers can sense their movie isn't that good and so try and skirt this line between bad and 'funny'. Army of Darkness may be trying something else. The special effects aren't that great and sometimes it's as if the movie could have been filmed in your house or your backyard or something. The mundane atmosphere makes the movie-itself seem that much better? Perhaps it's the main character Ash (Bruce Campbell). He says and does all the things you wish you could do. Perhaps Army of Darkness gives us a great action hero, yet just enough comedy and silliness it's acceptable to give in to it."
"fertilecelluloid","8","2","4","20 October 2006"," Great piece of pulp entertainment
","This third installment in the cult series has a thin connection to its predecessors. Ash (Bruce Campbell) is whisked back in time to medieval days where he must locate the ""Book of The Dead"", the tome that originally summoned the ""Evil Dead"" from beneath a cabin floor. The guy is such a dope that he only remembers part of the simple incantation for summoning the creatures and sending them back to their resting place. More a Harryhausen-style fantasy flick than pure, juvenile horror, it is, nevertheless, insanely entertaining if you're prepared to run with its non-stop craziness. The climax, which involves an army of skeletons marching on a castle, is pure, old school Harryhausen and even recalled a great Al Sarrantonio novel I'd read, ""Skeletons"", in which skinless nasties get up out of their graves and proceed to do bulk damage to the human race. Raimi's direction is inventive and the effects are wonderful. More deliberately comical than the other two, not as gory as the second entry, but a great piece of pulp entertainment, nonetheless."

","Army Of Darkness, also known as Evil Dead 3, is a funny and well-made movie. Ash is transported to the year 1300 A.D. after something goes wrong at the end of Evil Dead II. All sorts of crazy and funny things happen. It's a very short movie, but that doesn't stop it from being a great movie. It's simple and too the point. Army of Darkness is just such a great movie. Bruce Campbell does a great job portraying Ash, as usual. The fighting scenes are exciting. The main villain looks like something from Spawn, the Todd McFarlane comic book. It's not as good as Evil Dead II: Dead By Dawn, which I gave a 10 out of 10, but Army Of Darkness is still an awesome movie. 9/10"
"Aaron1375","9","2","4","7 July 2006"," The ending to a very good, but rather odd set of movies.
","The first movie was Evil Dead then came Evil Dead II and finally this little gem, Army of Darkness. The first one was almost pure horror, while the second interjected some humor here and there, but was still mainly a horror while this one has very little horror at all and is more of an action comedy. Once again this movie sort of picks off where the previous movie leaves off, sort of as we have our hero Ash transported back to medieval times where he is mistaken for a member of an opposing army. The previous movie had him hailed as a hero right away, but here he is taken prisoner and forced to fight the evil dead in a very cool pit fighting scene. He quickly wins the respect of the ones who tried to kill him and he is sent on a quest to fetch a book that has the ability to send away the evil dead and help him get back to his own time. What ensues are some very funny scenes and a rather big battle at the end which is also rather funny, lets face it seeing a guy picking up obvious fake skeletons and acting like they are attacking is just humorous. Bruce Campbell is great in this movie, however no one else in the cast really sticks out all that much except for the main villain who also just happens to be Bruce Campbell. Still he carries this movie and he is enough for one funny action horror movie."

","This is definitely Sam Raimi's best movie. No one but him could have made such a tour-De-force. I have always admired Raimi, his way of shooting and all his camera-acrobatics (at least until this one movie......), which I think represents an unmistakable trademark. The story starts right where The Evil Dead 2 left about 8 years before, but since the first lines it's clear that this movie is gonna take a different way. The movie itself is already funny (of course in a horrific way), but the winning at-out, that something which gives it the push to get beyond, is Bruce Campbell's re-interpretation of an old favorite character, the brave and unstoppable Ash, who, as usual, is fighting zombies, monsters and demons while pursuing the ill-famed Necronomicon, the latter ravenous and conspicuous as ever. Bruce's acting and mimic skills are here really in evidence, he shows a great feeling for his character but most of all he makes you laugh, he makes you laugh a lot with his unforgettable sentences and his unique, exuberant fight style. Any Raimi fan will love it."

","""Army Of Darkness"" is a movie that Horror fans in general shouldn't miss. it's an insane medieval epic with Horror tones and of course, the classical black humor displayed by Bruce Campbell. If you are a fan of the Evil Dead movies you will likely truly enjoy the third installment. Although it's not as gory and twisted as the previous Evil Dead (which was like being in the roller coaster after a few drinks) it's still damn entertaining. I would say it's a ""cool"" movie (although I don't like to use that word for description purposes).<br/><br/>Well, the plot has nothing to do with Evil Dead II (except for the ending) but still brings the deadites now as an army, and demons as the main villains. This time Ash assumes 100% the role as a ""hero"" and confronts an Army Of Darkness. Ash also demonstrates he's not only a demon hunter, but also a brave man that risks his ticket home to battle the army and save thousands of people.<br/><br/>The special effects are surprisingly good. It's believed that in order to make an epic movie you need a huge budget but Sam Raimi gives us a lesson with creative f/x and wicked battle sequences. You don't need millions of dollars in order to create a great epic and AoD demonstrates it.<br/><br/>""Army Of Darkness"" is a sui generis Horror epic. Maybe I'm wrong but it's the only movie I can think of with such elements as medieval settings, battle sequences between demon armies, and a futuristic hero with a chainsaw. Thank you Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell. If you miss demon possession from the previous movies, don't worry, there are a couple of scenes involving demons with the adequate make-up and that will please you. <br/><br/>The movie is a must see for those who are into 90's essential Horror. Give the movie a chance and get into the great but unconventional script. You might enjoy it."

","Whether you watch the entire trilogy every month or only watched this movie because a friend made you, you can pretty much agree that the thing that is really driving the movies is the character of Ash. At the beginning of the story Ash is the calm simple person that we all are (the S-mart employee in this movie) but as the story progresses, he transforms into the chainsaw wielding ultimate badass with a sawed off shotgun that we all wish we could be. The character of Ash is in his prime from the point he says Groovy in Evil Dead 2 until the point he says Groovy in Army of Darkness when he replaces his chainsaw with a metallic hand. The chainsaw hand and the sawed off shotgun are a large part of the character of Ash. So why does Sam Rami decide to give Ash his hand back and make him fight with medieval weapons in Army of Darkness. With out the Ash from the first Evil Dead movies, Army of Darkness seems to be almost a different genre of movie. The final battle seems to be more like Jason and the Argonauts than Evil Dead. Still the movie is not without its moments. The first encounter between Ash and Badash one of my most memorable. (This one actually does involve the use of a shotgun) Also everyone knows the Boomstick line. (I went to high school with kids who could recite the entire monologue) All in all the film is a good one. It is very funny and deserves the cult status that it has achieved in this day and age. Although I personally wanted to see more of Ash in action, I guess I will just have to pray for Evil Dead 4."

Him and his girlfriend Linda (Bridget Fonda) travel to a deserted cabin, where they find The Book Of The Dead and a tape recorder. Playing the recording releases the evil that lives in the forest, which takes Linda and possesses Ash's hand, which he cuts off. Skipping the main story of the 2nd film, Ash is pulled into a vortex and ends up in 1300 A.D. The people, especially Sheila (Embeth Davidtz), distrust him right away and throw him into a pit, where he defeats a monster. Proving his worth, they send him on a quest: to retrieve the Book of The Dead, which can send him back to his own time and help them defeat evil. Through Ash's bungling, he releases the Army of Darkness, lead by his evil twin, which soon kidnaps Sheila and plans on conquering the town people.<br/><br/>An interesting end to the series. There's no graphic violence as in the previous 2 films of the series (Although there is some light scares in it), and is heavy on laughs (Lots of Three Stooges references), and uses interesting references (Any fan of ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"" would pick up on the words that Ash uses).

","This is the final chapter in the Evil Dead series. If you haven't watched either Evil Dead or Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn don't worry. This movie has nothing to do with the first Evil Dead and neither does Dead by Dawn. But enough about that. This movie fills in the blank spots right in the beginning so you don't have to worry about missing something vital. This movie seems to back away from the extreme use of gore and instead uses a more of an adventure feel. Ash is now trapped in the past and in order to get back he needs to get the Book of the Dead from a grave yard. Seems simple, but Ash can't quiet remember the three words the wise man told him to recite before removing the book. So Ash awakens an Army of Darkness and ticks off the whole medieval culture he's currently living in. Overall the movie is pretty good, more fixation on comedy than on anything remotely scary. The movie is pretty cheesy which could be a problem if you don't like cheesy humor. Ash does have some pretty good catch lines, I mostly recommend this to the Evil Dead fans but some who didn't like the first two may very well find this one a fresh step in a different direction."

However I have seen a few clips of this film online and i decided to check out the whole thing and honestly, pretty good. Obviously the CGI is pretty bad, but the film still holds up because of the fact that most of it is done practically. The costume work and small stop motion pieces of this movie pleasantly surprised me. I think what brings this film down is the protagonist. Ash just is... annoying. I don't enjoy how arrogant and mean he is at times. I get that he is supposed to be a rough and tumble type of guy from the 20th century but he is basically a dick to everyone except for this one girl, and he's only not a dick to her because he wants to sleep with her. This film is weird, there is a scene in the middle of this film that just felt so out of place. It's like they threw all their cool fight scenes are costumes out the window for some incredibly stupid CGI comedy part.

","The ""Evil Dead"" series gets lots of deserved love. But in the midst of all that love the original film, it's re-imagining, the comics and now TV series over shadow part three. Just because it doesn't have ""Evil Dead"" in the title this is an epic film. Slapstick humor, violence, gore are all on display in this criminally under-rated masterpiece of a the beloved franchise. Side note: There are many versions of this film available due to many different factors most involving the studio not approving of certain aspects of the film. It's all good but the bootleg/director's cut with the original ending is the must see."

","Some movies are good, some are bad. Some movies are so bad they're good. Because of this, some people try to make some movies that are so bad they're good. If you try to fail and do so, have you succeeded? Well we don't have to ask that question with this movie, because it's not bad enough to be bad or good, and it's really not good. Thus we conclude it's a mediocre attempt at being so bad it's good.<br/><br/>Our hero the brazen braggart Ash goes back in time, where he is the Chosen One who will defeat the Army of Darkness...provided he can remember a few simple syllables. That's really it as far as the plot goes, along with the whole deal with Evil Ash the doppelganger leading the Army of Darkness. For some reason, it sounds better on paper, and it really shouldn't have.<br/><br/>That said, this movie still has it's tongue-in-cheek charm. Ash's lines are made-for cult favorites, and the action is wonderfully banal. One of the strongest parts of the movie has to do with its pacing, how development is discarded to just get the action moving from scene to scene. For instance, the wise man continuing nonchalantly with his speech after Ash dispatches of a Deadite that interrupts them.<br/><br/>It is quite definitely a fun, good time not meant to be taken seriously, more fun especially with friends and a good crowd.<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"

","Through the tell-tale fake sets, the cheesy acting, the excessive growling of ""Bad Ash"", I was not laughing.  I was yawning, shifting in my chair, and trying to keep from falling asleep.<br/><br/>Definite spoilers.  It's time to break it down.<br/><br/>""Army of Darkness"" is, I suppose, the third in a series of equally crummy movies.  I have not seen the first two, so I am unable to comment on them. However, the beginning of ""Army of Darkness"" gives us a glimpse of the end of the second one, and I could tell it was just as awful.<br/><br/>""Army of Darkness"" is unsuitable for those who enjoy well thought-out movies.  It cannot decide whether it is Action/Adventure, Horror, or Comedy, and this constant struggle for a genre is anything but satisfying.  Some of the one-liners were funny, yes, but everything else was just really lame.<br/><br/>At first I liked the movie.  It reminded me of a really cool PC game known as ""Serious Sam"".  However, ""Army of Darkness"" strayed too far past the action/adventure boundaries and went right into Transylvania.  I was shocked at the sudden change.  First Ash, our rough and tough macho hero who cannot be stopped, was in a medieval castle, then suddenly in a twisted world of scarred trees, plastic boulders, and an unbelievable graveyard. ""Unbelievable"" meaning I can't believe that they actually thought people would accept it.<br/><br/>There is a scene involving a windmill that is just outright stupid.  Small spawns inexplicably emerge from Ash and cause many troubles for our hero. This scene goes on and on, almost endlessly.  Another scene involves Ash attempting to escape from skeletal hands that appear from the ground, and for at least a minute or so we watch as he lies flat on the ground and tangles with these hands.  Scenes like these, in which an event deters from the story way too much, occur often.  I was very annoyed.<br/><br/>And let's not get started on those ""Deadites"".  I say that if you don't have the power or technology to do it, you shouldn't even try.  These things are AWFUL.  Gave me a headache just watching them try to walk.<br/><br/>Then there's the actual filming.  Some parts got so blurry that I was tempted to either fast forward or just hit ""Stop"".<br/><br/>The character development is weak, the plot is sub-standard (how many times have we seen undead creatures attack a castle?), the villains are superimposed on a crummy blue screen, and every single set seems as though it was made to look phony.<br/><br/>The hero, Ash, is not so bad.  He provides a little comic relief (too much in some areas) and enough sarcasm and toughness that helps the movie to its feet.<br/><br/>But the rest of the movie drags it back under.  It's a flop.  I should probably go into how awful the music sounded, but then I'd end up writing a ten page essay on how screechy music destroys any decent score.  Reminds me of ""The Shining""...<br/><br/>All in all, don't watch this movie.  It's a shame.  The first twenty minutes or so are interesting and fun, but the rest will just give you a headache. And then the end..."
"Wturnerbill","6","3","9","28 June 2002"," Am I the only one that was disappointed?
","When I was a kid Evil Dead was my favorite movie. Evil Dead II wasn't far behind and I thought they'd never make another sequel. In 1993 ads for Army of Darkness popped up on TV and I almost dropped a load in my pants. I shook with antisipation. When I finally saw the movie, I was crushed. If it wasn't a sequel to Evil Dead, I'd probably like it. Army of Darkness could have been the perfect opportunity to explore Evil Dead in a medieval setting, but it was squandered on stooge style antics. (slight spoiler) I absolutely hated it when, after the love interest is possessed and killed, she comes back to life and in one piece for the finale. In Evil Dead, There is no return from  possession and there is no return from death."

","I am not averse to mixing comedy and horror, but if the individual aspects themselves are worthless, how can you expect the aggregate to magically gain some substance? Impossible, just ask your local symbolic logicist.<br/><br/>
Simply watch the first five minutes and you will realize that the horror department is bankrupt, comedy must come to the rescue.<br/><br/>
With corny comedy, there's that which is funny because it is so absurd or so obvious that the mellowed air of the laid back film promotes laughter. Army's brand of corny comedy was more of a ""it's funny because it's stupid"" humor. If this is your type of humor go for it, but for me, 'Army' is a 'Princess Bride' without the dialogue and a 'Naked Gun' without the jokes. Now that is funny, think of watching 'Naked Gun' without the jokes. It's actually not, and never again shall I."

","I love all the other films in the Evil Dead series, but there's no getting around the fact that this one just sucks. I get the feeling that anybody who considers this film a ""classic"" either saw it when it came out and enjoys it purely for the nostalgia, or was raised by one of these people and forced to watch it over and over again until they felt the same way as their mentally challenged parent and/or guardian.<br/><br/>The ""comedic"" aspects are borderline-retarded slapstick that are the cinematic equivalent of a man making funny faces to amuse a newborn child, the ""action"" sequences are aggressively tepid and hardly worth watching, and the only ""horror"" to be found here is the aforementioned horrifically unfunny ""jokes"".<br/><br/>And it's not even that I don't enjoy unrefined humor, at east when it's done well. It's just that seeing a man make funny faces and voices while getting hit in the face... isn't funny.<br/><br/>Some of the other reviewers noted that this film as a ""copious amount of gore"", which sincerely makes me wonder if they watched the same movie that I watched.

","First, let me say I knew EXACTLY what I was getting into when I rented this. I love Bruce Campbell, and I love camp, and the idea of Bruce Campbell taking on campy skeletons while spouting off campy one-liners was too great to pass up. And it certainly has its moments: the free-falling car in the beginning is classic, and Bruce is too cool for school kicking demon butt with his sawed-off shotgun and chainsaw, while being an arrogant jerk to the villagers he's helping.<br/><br/>Yes, those parts are all good. But there's FAR TOO LITTLE of them. Half of the movie is just some screwed up Saturday morning cartoon! I was hoping to see Ash being a badass and killing monsters the whole time, but instead I had to sit through this slapstick humor that seems to be aimed at 5-year-olds. Honestly, for all you die-hard fans of this movie, is it THAT entertaining to see Bruce fighting with 4-inch-tall versions of himself? Is it THAT entertaining to see him being attacked by a flying book? There was too much goofy and childish stuff going on, and I sure didn't expect that from a movie about a guy with a chainsaw for a hand. It has a few redeeming qualities, but I was mostly disappointed."
"gregsrants","6","2","5","19 February 2004"," Enjoyable, just don't tell anyone.
","Have you ever gone to a movie and completely enjoyed yourself with all the action, comedy and romp only to leave the theatre thinking that you may not even give the movie a thumbs- up if you were asked for your opinion? That is exactly the situation I found myself in after watching Sam Raimi's third installment of the Evil Dead series, Army of Darkness.<br/><br/>Army of Darkness picks up where Evil Dead II left off 5 years earlier. Ashley J. Williams (or 'Ash' as we have come to know him) has been transported back to 1400 A.D. where he must continue to fight for his survival and deliver the people from the evil Deadites. Armed with a shotgun and a chainsaw arm (this may sound incredibly ridiculous if you have not seen the second installment), Ash is prophesized to deliver the Necronomicon, or Book of the Dead, which will rid the English townspeople of the walking dead and return Ash back to 1993 so that he can continue as a clerk at the local S-Mart.<br/><br/>As odd or downright foolish that the plot may sound, Sam Raimi (Spider-Man) does a good job of keeping us entertained with a balanced mix of slapstick comedy and outlandish gore. Bruce Campbell (Ash) doesn't take himself too seriously and the results include such laughable quotes as 'Oh you little b**tards! Alright, I'll crush each and every last one of ya! I'll squash you so hard you'll have to look down to look up!'. These types of verbal exchanges definitely lighten the tone from the heavy blood soaked Evil Dead I and II entries.<br/><br/>But what ultimately makes Army of Darkness so sinfully enjoyable is watching all the fun Campbell and Raimi seem to be having with the character and the notion of a self-centered fool using his 20th century knowledge in 15th century Europe. Whether it is Ash building himself a new arm or uttering modern day witticisms ('Gimme some sugar, baby.'), the movie never takes itself too seriously and that is most of the fun.<br/><br/>In terms of special effects, the movie has both the best and the worst of what technology had to offer in the early 1990's. A scene where the army of the dead storms the castle is an ode to Jason and the Argonauts and the splendid work of effects master Ray Harryhausen. It is well crafted and choreographed and hi-light of the films effects. On the very opposite end of the scale is the scene in which Mini-Ashes run amok over the full sized Ash, jumping into his mouth, sticking him with a fork.you get the idea. The Mini-Ashes look like they were from a completely different film and the whole chapter on the DVD should be avoided if possible.<br/><br/>So now I come back full circle with my initial statement. I enjoyed viewing Army of Darkness, and am embarrassed because of it. The humor is definitely adolescent, but you feel like a diabetic enjoying a chocolate bar, savoring the taste and hoping no one witnesses your satisfaction. Sam Raimi, who also helmed Darkman, does his best with an $11 million budget (his later $139 million budget for Spider-Man showed his true genius), and you can image by the energy exerted in such a preposterous storyline, that the cast and crew had oodles and oodles of fun during production. Thumbs up. Just don't tell anybody.<br/><br/>Post note: For you star search enthusiasts, look for Bridget Fonda, hot off the heels of her role in Single White Female, as Linda.<br/><br/>www.robertsreviews.com"

","What happened to the horror elements? Although the first two Evil Dead films show some touches of pitch black humor and camp (much moreso in ED 2), the series to this point had gallons of gore and some legitimate moments of grotesque horror. In Army of Darkness, Raimi strips out the horror elements almost entirely, ups the slapstick humor and ends up with a film that feels like Jason and the Argonauts meets the Three Stooges.<br/><br/>On the plus side, this is the film in the series that features the best of Ash's misogynist, cocky and moronic one-liners. Bruce Campbell is such a great screen presence that he carries the film all by himself for a good half hour. The set designs are decent in a crappy Terry Gilliam kind of way and Raimi's visual flare and bizarro camera angles are always welcome.<br/><br/>The problem is the story and the change in tone. Around the midway point though the novelty of seeing Ash in the fantasy dark ages started to wear off and the humor in the film was a little too broad (i.e. juvenile) to sustain itself. I recently let my 9 y/o daughter watch Army of Darkness - she has NO tolerance for horror films and thought this movie was a riot. Army of Darkness isn't scary at all.<br/><br/>If Army of Darkness is the first of the ""Evil Dead Trilogy"" you've seen you'll probably like it a lot more than I did.

Everything from ""boomstick"" to ""gimme some sugar baby"" are memorable lines. Personally, for my money my favorite line is ""Good, bad. I'm the guy with the gun."" Bruce Campbell definitely carries this movie and Sam Raimi's stellar direction helps. Danny Elfman's orchestral score to "" March of the Dead"" is quite good, it makes the movie feel far more epic than it is.

Blending high energy jinks in medieval times with comedy horror staples, it's a riotous idea that mostly works. Of course one has to accept it on its riotous terms, this for sure isn't a pic for the highbrow crowd.

It's all breakneck stuff that's performed with a wonderfully self mocking attitude that's easy to warm to. It's a comic book brought to life and it never sags, but some of the cartoon sequence beasties sadly do look a little flat.<br/><br/>Great fun if prepared for what type of pic it is, it's not hard to see why it is so beloved in Evil Dead fan circles. 7/10<br/><br/>Footnote: There are alterante ending versions, of which I have only seen the downbeat time potion one - but being the miserable sod that I am, I love this ending."

","For those fans of the Evil Dead, you need not a review. This movie is just a continuation in the incredible series and that should be good enough. But for those who aren't familiar with the series, ""Army of Darkness"" is still a VERY entertaining stand alone film.<br/><br/>If someone were to explain the plot to you, you would think it sounds like the cheesiest movie plot you've ever heard. ""Dude, it's about this guy who sent back in time to like the medieval period and he's sent on a mission to kill a bunch of monsters and zombies, his evil twin and such to recover the book of the dead to vanquish the army of darkness."" It just sounds ridiculous. AND IT IS! And that's what's most appealing about it. It's got the ultimate B-movie appeal. It's filled with great humor mixed with slapstick and one-liners, it's a low budget production (if you're into that), and it's central character is perhaps one of the most enjoyable ever imagined.<br/><br/>Ash (or simply Bruce Campbell, the two have become interchangeable) is a very fun character for two reasons. First, he is perhaps the most incompetent hero you'll ever encounter and the only incomplete idiot. Ash truly shows that if you're going to be good at just one thing...be good at fighting the undead. Second, Bruce Campbell is a grade A Badass! Whether it's his Ugly American attitude of being loud, crude, rude, egocentric, and obnoxious or simply his attire of wielding a chainsaw for a hand and a shotgun he calls his boomstick, Ash always comes out as top dog. Campbell could easily give Norris, Stallone, Willis, and Statham a run for their money.<br/><br/>All in all, ""Army of Darkness"" just might be the most entertaining bad movie you'll ever see. Meaning it should be bad based on so many elements, but it's amazingly fun and memorable."

It is not often you see a great hero in a movie anymore. This is a movie I would definitely show to my kids just to show them that heroes are men, not wussies like movies today have to portray.

In fact, I really cannot comment on the rest of the cast except to say that they supported Campbell well.

Bruce Campbell is fun as Ash. He's still got it. He has some very well delivered lines that just take the cake. The story is fine. He's gotta battle the evil dead that attempts to reclaim the Necronomicon: Book of the dead.<br/><br/>So what's missing? The horror. The sinister and eerie feeling from the first two Evil Dead movies is not here, replaced by common slapstick humor that gets old in a hurry.

They should have focused more on the gritty and awesome one-liners delivered by Campbell and less on the slapstick. Campbell's liners are this movie greatest strengths. Nothing beats the lines of ""Yo, She-Bitch, Let's go!"" or ""This is my BOOMSTICK!"" Pure genius.<br/><br/>The Last Word: Alright.

","SPOILERS<br/><br/>There are very few sequels that could stand up to the original. Firstly, Evil Dead Two surpassed Evil Dead One with flying colors. Now, in my opinion, Army of Darkness surpasses Evil Dead Two and Evil Dead One. This is a lot like Evil Dead Two. By that, I mean, combining humor and horror. Quite frankly, I think this is way funnier than Evil Dead Two. <br/><br/>Army of Darkness begins with a summary of what happened in Evil Dead Two. Then, he's sucked in the vortex and finds himself in the Medevil Times. The Oldsmobile made it too! In the Medevil Times, he's claimed to be one of Henry's men. Ash is enslaved. A woman named Sheila thinks that he killed her brother and he is taken to the pit. His chainsaw and shotgun are taken away from him. Before he is thrown into the pit, however, someone else is. The man screams and a gigantic blood geyser, like another horror film, spews out. The horror film I am talking about is, of course, A Nightmare On Elm Street. Anyway, he is thrown into the pit. The pit is dark and foggy. That is never good in a horror film. And in this film, it isn't very different. A deadite comes out of nowhere and to make matters worse, the spiked walls start closing in. Then, a priest throws him his chainsaw. He decapitates the deadite and tries to climb up the wall.Then a zombie comes out of the wall. He cuts off it's hand. Ash uses his belt to grab a chain that lifts up. The zombie grabs Ash's foot. Luckily, Ash gets out of the pit and the spiked walls crush the zombie. Then he threatens the town with his boom stick to make them help him return home. But, the priest thinks he is the one who will help them fight off the deadites and save the town. He agrees only for help to return home in return. Ash needs to get the Book of the Dead because that contains the spells to fight off the deadites. While he does this, he falls in love with the woman who thought he was her brother's killer.<br/><br/>Then, the big day comes. The priest tells him to find the Book and say the words from the Day the Earth Stood Still. He finds the Books. Yes, there were three Books. After he receives numerous injuries from the first two Books, he gets the last Book. Unfortunately, he forgets the words and says them wrong, thus the Evil Dead is released.

"Quinoa1984","8","1","2","28 July 2005"," Raimi's evolved style of total comic book hilarity
","Sam Raimi's third (but possibly not last) installment in his 'Evil Dead' series shows Ash (Bruce Campbell, a cult hero of sorts) right after Evil Dead 2, now back in medieval times, still fighting against the unpredictably grotesque and bizarre Necronomicon. This is just a set-up though, like with most comic-books, for mostly a series of visual gags, in-jokes, puns, homages, and out-right hilarity and parody. In other words, if you're wanting to watch this for the same reasons you wanted to watch the original Evil Dead, you may be disappointed. This is the sort of evolution that Raimi has taken the series with: the first was a film from a filmmaker 21 years old, with an over-load of visual energy, pumping out one of the most visceral and inventive of all horror films. <br/><br/>The sequel went half and half- at times it took the sincerity and true horror of the first film, but it also had a lot to laugh about too, as it didn't take itself seriously for most of it. With Army of Darkness, it's tongue-in-cheek incarnate. Take a scene where Ash has just resurrected the ""deadites"" (through some fault of his own, mumbling the last word of his forgotten phrase to stop the curse from the book of the dead) to rise. He suddenly gets pulled down to the ground, and the skeletons from the graves have their way with him, in short, having a fight in the tradition of a Three Stooges skit (blocking eye-pokes and all). This leads up to the skeletons forming their 'army' of the title, and it's more like a wild send-up of Jason and the Argonauts than a real 'zombie' film as some horror fans might be mis-led to believe. By the time Ash gets out his chainsaw wielded on his arm, its become cliché all the way, but expertly clever cliché.<br/><br/>There is no 'message' from the film really, it's just a full-blown, ludicrous romp with the middle ages and the occult- and it's all the better (and gets better on repeat viewings like Brooksfilm comedies) due to this. And the film may or may not work for some depending on the stamina and prowess of Campbell, who for me is one of the funniest people working in low-budget films today (he comes up occasionally in big-budget films too), but may be a little too 'ham' for some viewers. Like Evil Dead 2, From Dusk Till Dawn, and Return of the Living Dead among others, Army of Darkness joins that handful of films that's for a select audience (it's not as graphic with its gore as in the first film, but its still in high gear), to have as a good 'party movie' with friends. A ""gas"" from start to finish, to coin a term that does apply well here as one of the better films of 93. A-"

"Blazehgehg","9","1","2","24 June 2005"," One of the greatest movies ever made
","Sequel to Evil Dead 2, Army of Darkness provides us with a smattering of genres laced with a break-neck high-intensity filming style, long before Sam Raimi became a hot commodity with Spider-Man. This film almost has everything you could ask for - Comedy, Action, Horror, even a little bit of romance - and, of course, more catchy one-liners than you can shake a boomstick at.<br/><br/>The story goes that Ash and a few friends of his trek up to a rickety old cabin in the woods - wherein they discover an ancient log from a researcher who studied The Book of the Dead - the Necronomicon. After unwittingly unleashing a horrible evil, one by one, everybody is either killed - or becomes part of the evil themselves. The evil even begins to infect Ash, through his hand - which he cuts off at the wrist. In a final moment of desperation, Ash recites an incantation from the Book, hoping to re-seal the evil. Unfortunately for him, things are never that easy... a vortex opens, swallowing the cabin, Ash, and all his belongings.<br/><br/>Once he comes out the other side, he discovers he has been transported to Medieval times, where his appearance was prophesied to bring salvation from the deadites - the very creatures he tried to vanquish in the woods that night. The only way he can get back home is by retrieving the very book that started the mess: The Necronomicon. Ash accepts the quest, but only so he can get sent home again - but in doing so, he once again unleashes a terrible evil; an evil that wants it's book back.<br/><br/>This movie is just really well made. The comedy and the action blend almost perfectly. Ash makes his transformation quite well - after surviving what can almost literally be described as Hell (Evil Dead 2), Ash emerges in this movie as brave, confident, strong, and perhaps a little insane - ready to face any battle the Deadites throw at him, with Shotgun and Chainsaw in hand. There are some inconsistencies involving certain events in the film (the items Ash keeps in the trunk of his car, for example), but given the over-the-top nature of the rest of the movie - it only adds to the feeling of fun radiating from the entire production. Evil Dead's B-Movie roots grow deep, and Army of Darkness, if anything, only lampoons and emphasizes that fact even more, with 100ft jets of blood exploding from pits, ninja-agility deadites, and three stooges parodies.<br/><br/>Even if you haven't seen Evil Dead or Evil Dead 2, Army of Darkness provides a pretty in-depth flashback sequence when the film starts - making it recommended viewing for anybody anywhere."

","First let me start by saying that Army of Darkness is probably the worst film i've ever seen, but only in terms of scenery. If anything though the the rubbish scenery is what makes this film so catchy. It is a really funny film, Bruce Campbell is simply classy in this film as a dopey hero. I actually didn't really like this film when i watched the first 5 minutes but because the film isn't too long i decided to give it a chance, that is a decision i don't regret. The bit that sticks in memory for me is when evil Ash takes off the lady's clothes in one movement while saying ""Gimme some sugar babey"". That was just a funny scene, another is at the end when Ash has to take 6 drops of that potion to wake up in his time. He gets distracted and takes 7, that was a moment of stupidity that made me laugh. If you feel bored and have 90 minutes to spare then why not watch Army of Darkness? It is a decent film."

Personally I LOVE this film, simply due to the fact that it pushes my buttons in terms of its humour. Whereas the first two movies were trying to be sincere in its horror but still kinda ending up funny, I admire how Sam Raimi just drops the reigns and says ""what the hell....lets have some fun"", and makes it intentionally funny. It works brilliantly. I like also how it pokes fun out of corporate America and the climate of consumerism we live in.

","*** out of **** (theatrical release)<br/><br/>
** 1/2 (director's cut)<br/><br/>Proving you can't keep a good deadite slayer down, Army of Darkness marks the return of Ash in the third film of the highly popular Evil Dead trilogy. Ash (Bruce Campbell) is no longer confined to the isolated cabin in the woods, now that he's been transported to the 14th century (don't ask), apparently somewhere in England.  He's seen as an enemy by the local Lord Arthur, but quickly becomes hero and savior to the people when he kills a couple of deadites.  Consequently, and in order to return to his time, he's sent on a quest to retrieve the Necronomicon, the Book of the Dead.  What should be a simple task results in the creation of the army of darkness, which Ash must battle to keep evil from spreading throughout the land.<br/><br/>Army of Darkness' plot is pure nonsense, sort of a mix of Monty Python and just about every fantasy movie you may have seen.  The entire movie's success is based on humor, and it delivers with consistent comic ingenuity. All traces of horror its predecessors had is all but gone here, those expecting to experience terror with their mirth will be sorely disappointed. Army of Darkness is a silly comedy from beginning to end, and it revels in its silliness.<br/><br/>Easily the movie's anchor and probably the only reason I couldn't stop giggling for all 81 minutes is cult fave and comic genius Bruce Campbell. Roles of this kind are perfectly suited for him, and he doesn't disappoint. Whether it's his sharp one-liners, priceless facial reactions, or general good-nature about making a complete fool of himself, Campbell is hilarious as Ash.  This is undoubtedly my favorite performance of his, period.<br/><br/>Director Sam Raimi shows off his usual kinetic style, delivering plenty of zooms and swirling camera movements.  Most of the action sequences (and there are a LOT of them) are played equally for laughs and thrills, but probably succeed at the former slightly more successfully than the latter. The only movie I can think of that managed to keep its action completely thrilling while consistently mingled with silly physical humor is Stephen Sommers' The Mummy (which obviously gained inspiration from this movie).<br/><br/>As much as I enjoyed Army of Darkness, it's not as if though the movie couldn't have been improved.  Some jokes fall flat and the concept of Ash fighting his evil twin hardly lives up to its full potential. While the intentionally cheesy and fun special effects and make-up effects are perfectly suited for the film, I would have preferred more sets.  Most of the movie is based around one castle (albeit a very large one), without even a small village surrounding it; kind of gives off that low-budget vibe (though it's easily the most expensive of the Evil Dead series).<br/><br/>The director's cut attaches another fifteen minutes to the movie, most of which neither hampers the movie nor enhances its enjoyment.  In fact, I would have welcomed this 96-minute cut if not for the alternate ending, which may be more in tone with the trilogy, but doesn't measure up to the hilarious S-Mart finale of the theatrical cut.  As far as comparison with its predecessors, it's different enough in tone to not warrant any comparisons, but what the hell, I'll give one, anyway.  Army of Darkness is more consistently enjoyable than Evil Dead 2 (which wasn't scary and only sporadically funny), but not up to par with the original The Evil Dead (which remains one of the most frightening films I've ever seen)."

","Not better or worse than Evil Dead II, just different.  Just as stupid, but just as loveable and hilarious.  Like its predecessor, this is not a film for people who can't appreciate sick, twisted, humor.  Like I said in my Evil Dead II review, if you're one of those people don't even bother with this film.  The rest of us with a sense of humor will sit back and spout ""Groovy"" from time to time.   <br/><br/>Everything that made Evil Dead one of the few great horror/comedies returns in Army of Darkness, only now the setting has changed, and the plot has been revamped.  Bruce Campbell reprises his role in a way only Bruce Campbell can; if you hated his lines in Evil Dead II, don't bother with Army of Darkness.  He's one upped the cheesiness and hasn't gotten any brighter, and no that's not a complaint.  <br/><br/>Sam Raimi returns to direct this third installment, again bringing his unique 3 Stooges-ish humor to his little horror/mideival world.  Ted Raimi makes about a half dozen appearances, oh yeah, and Sam's car is back for more abuse. <br/><br/>Army of Darkness throws back the restraints of its predecessors, and just goes all out to be the biggest laugh it can be.  I think it succeeds.  Kudos to anyone who can identify Danny Elfman's musical contribution (not that it's hard to identify Elfman's style).  Improved special effects, though dated now, they're fine for this film.   <br/><br/>All of my opinions on Evil Dead II stand and apply here, so you can read there if you want a little more information on why I like this film.  But basically, in a nutshell, Army of Darkness is extremely corny, but it knows exactly what it's doing, and it doesn't try to be anything more than it is: It's a fun ride with a dark atmosphere.  As stupid as most of the elements are, Army of Darkness is a fun move; therefor, who cares?  Sit back and have fun with it . . ."
"soranno","Null","1","2","25 October 2002"," Not enough laughs but plenty of action
","This film usually describes itself as more of a comedy than anything else but the humor is practically nonexistent when opposed to the incredible action scenes and great special effects. It makes up for its lack of humor with an abundance of action. This third installment in director Sam Raimi's ""Evil Dead"" series once again features Bruce Campbell as the brave but dense Ash. This time out, an evil magical book transports Ash back to medieval times where he must do battle with several Dark Knight foes before he can return back to his own time. As usual with these kinds of films, there's enough gore to keep fans of that genre interested."

","Poor old Bruce Campbell.  He just can't catch a break.  Once again, he's everybody's favourite punchbag, but at least he gets to deliver some cracking dumb-but-funny macho misogynist lines.<br/><br/>The film starts slowly and patchily, and it's no longer even pretending to be horror, or a gore fest - it's a slapstick comedy ""Cult of Ash"" vehicle, pure and simple.  That's not necessarily a criticism, and things picks up when the titular Army of Darkness appears - a dodgily animated but genuinely charismatic skeleton horde that are actually better actors than the generic mediaeval live action rabble!<br/><br/>The plot is painfully thin, and the whole film is basically a series of vignettes leading to excuses for a one liner or a quote (or, bizarelly, a *misquote* of Henry V).  Really, the only thing worth watching is Bruce Campbell as the various incarnations of Ash, but he is *very* watchable. Indeed, when Raimi and Robert Tapert went on to develop this ""psuedo historical slapstick action"" concept into the Herculese and Xena shows, it's amazing that Bruce was only given an occasional guest role.<br/><br/>All that said, Army of Darkness isn't something I could watch a lot. There's only really half a good film in there, plus some rather lame padding.  The thought occurs that it could probably be edited right down to a quality 1 hour TV special and not lose anything significant."

I love Lucio Fulci and the slapstick horrors of Peter Jackson (""Dead Alive"") and Stuart Gordon (""Re-Animator"" is a masterpiece).  But Sam Raimi's films never did much for me.  In each installment of the ""Evil Dead"" trilogy, he seems to be trying too hard--one-upping himself constantly in terms of horror and humor, but with neither of those elements being very strong to begin with. ""Army of Darkness"" is the third installment in the trilogy, a film that thinks it's a lot funnier and scarier than it really is.  Most of the time, Raimi wants to covey, as loudly as possible, ""ISN'T THIS HILARIOUS? IT'S OH-SO OVER-THE-TOP!"" when, in reality, it's not.  Special effects eventually take over the meager plot.  Bruce Campbell is a capable leading man who gives the material his all, but he's mostly reduced to uttering hit-or-miss one-liners.  Sam Raimi may have a cult reputation for these films, but there's a reason his recent, non-horror output (""A Simple Plan"" comes to mind) has been better: it's balanced and controlled.<br/><br/>4/10"

","(This review is for the 96-minute director's cut.)<br/><br/>A film that aims to please as much as ""Army Of Darkness"" does shouldn't be too hard to enjoy. But a weak story and flat characterizations did limit my enjoyment of director Sam Raimi and star Bruce Campbell's signature inventiveness.<br/><br/>The last of Raimi's acclaimed ""Evil Dead"" films that all featured Campbell, ""Army Of Darkness"" marks a major tonal shift for the series, as the horror elements that dominated the first two films are replaced by humor, and the eerie original setting of an isolated cabin is swapped out for an unconvincing medieval Europe.<br/><br/>Ash (Campbell), deposited in the Middle Ages at the end of ""Evil Dead II,"" makes an uneasy peace with Lord Arthur (Marcus Gilbert) and his people. Ash goes out to find the Necronomicon, the Book of the Dead, which has the power to send Ash back to his own time. Ash finds it, along with much trouble, all because Ash forgot the last word of an intonation he was supposed to deliver when taking the book. Leave it to Ash.<br/><br/>""Did you speak the exact words?"" Ash is asked by Arthur's bearded wise man (Ian Abercrombie), whom Ash calls ""spinach chin.""<br/><br/>""Look, maybe I didn't say every single little tiny syllable, no,"" Ash replies. ""But basically I said them, yeah.""<br/><br/>At the head of the evil horde roused by Ash's miscue is a familiar looking character, Evil Ash (also Campbell, in heavy make-up.) The series premise didn't start out being about Ash's stupidity, but that was what it became by ""Army Of Darkness,"" now doubled by Ash's cruel-but-equally-dim doppelganger.<br/><br/>Watching the two trade macho quips and get fooled by each other is fun for a while, but as ""Army Of Darkness"" goes on it becomes obvious Raimi doesn't have much else on offer this time. He's still got that ingenious hyperkinetic style, with POV shots of flying arrows and catapult boulders, but as a story it seems oddly artificial. The other ""Evil Dead"" films were artificial, too, but their accent on thrills and gore made this easier to accept.<br/><br/>Here Raimi and Campbell double down on the comedy. Sometimes, it works, as when Ash and Evil Ash first meet and we find out why Evil Ash gets to wear such over-the-top make-up for the rest of the film. Yet the reliance on catch phrases gets annoying, as every action scene seems an excuse for a close-up of Ash saying something like ""Come to Pappa"" or ""Gimme some sugar, baby.""<br/><br/>There are bits of story that seem to get away from Raimi and his brother/co-screenwriter Ivan Raimi, like an alliance between Arthur and a rival lord which comes out of left field. And why is Bridget Fonda in this movie? She's gone after two minutes in a non-speaking role, yet was at the time by far the most recognizable face in the cast. If it was an in-joke by Raimi, I didn't get it.<br/><br/>The director's cut also suffers from a lame trick ending, which I won't give away except to say it is both too obvious and too heavy. I would have minded it even more if I had cared about the characters.<br/><br/>Mostly, the problem with ""Army Of Darkness"" is that it both requires familiarity with the other two ""Evil Dead"" films to understand at a basic level, yet pulls away so dramatically from what you expect going in as to make that backstory not only unnecessary but counter- productive. It's a strange film on its own, often funny and exciting, yet on the whole disappointing, too."

","Army of Darkness is pulp art. It sacrifices being good using a normal centralized story design and instead it is good by executing unrefined, spattered entertainment from a different realm. Army of Darkness is a crazy comedy, not much of a horror. It's a unique movie with a great niche. Bruce Campbell is perfect as Ash. Campbell's animated acting throughout the film is consistently approving as it never gets stale. Embeth Davidtz is so lovely and such a great actress. Embeth emits a true capturing characterization of the good and evil Sheila. Sam Raimi does an excellent job with the Evil Dead series. Raimi's true abilities are brought to life within Evil Dead's type of genre. I've never seen The Evil Dead or Evil Dead II but a little, but I understand Army of Darkness to be distinctly different from its prequels primarily for its comedy and as such Army of Darkness is the best of the 3."

This will be right up some people's alleys, but I can't say I loved the change. <br/><br/>As the movie picks up where Evil Dead 2 left off, Ash is transported back through time. The evil of the Deadites and the power of the Necronomicon still wait for him in England's Dark Ages, however, and he's unwillingly thrust into a battle to save a castle full of people from the an army of undead. <br/><br/>Some people will probably welcome the shift in scope and total change in tone, but I really missed the vibe of the first two flicks. Sure, they were way over-the-top and occasionally campy/silly, but Army of Darkness is a completely different animal. I'll stick to the original two films over the silly action hijinks of Army of Darkness."

Following on seamlessly from the first two tales in the trilogy, its way bigger budget shows. EVIL DEAD 2: DEAD BY DAWN was a classic in its own right (will anyone, and I mean ANYONE ever top the plate-smashing sequence?) but this is another level up again!<br/><br/>Unless you are dead, one-dimensional, humorless  or just straight-out contrary, you could not fail to be dragged along here for a riotous and action-orientated laugh-fest. <br/><br/>After Ash and his beat-up Chev are sucked into the vortex in 2, they are spewed out in medieval times...none too gently either! It is the very mix of impossibly conflicting worlds that sets this film up for so much good-natured (and scripted) idiocy. A send up of every schlocky horror made, including itself, Ash battles the armies of the evil dead after he fails to retrieve the Necronomican without uttering syllable for syllable the immortal words ""Klaatu Barada Nicto."" Playing multiple roles here (check it out, if you didn't know already), Ash is the bravest knight of them all, wielding one-liners as dextrously as his broadsword and chainsaw.<br/><br/>This is fun with a capital ""H."" Amazing fx and Danny Elfman's stirring score is as good as anything he has ever done. It is NOT a film to analyse and critically disassemble, it is one to ride and kick-ass with! Perhaps the absolute highlight of the flick is the very last scene in the supermarket - ""Gimme some sugar baby."" No film to my knowledge has come up with any more inspired an ending.  <br/><br/>Bruce Campbell is so perfectly cast as Ash...he can never escape the role - nor would any of us ever want him too. For all that Brando, De Niro, Pacino, Davis (Bette), etc, have achieved, Campbell has topped them all as far as screen ""immortality"" is concerned.

I guess I wanted to see another Evil Dead 2 and this was certainly not it. The humor, which in that film was campy, was corny in this one. The monsters weren't realistic looking in evil dead 2, but they were kind of believable in the sense that you didn't look at them and know exactly what went on to create them. Here, they are too elementary. The bad guy leader is dumb looking and the skeletons would have been so much cooler if they didn't talk. As far as visual creativity, this movie really doesn't have it. The skeletons were done exactly the same decades earlier in Jason and the Aragnaughts. Alas, it was not a bad movie. It kept me watching, hoping that some creatures would be cool and I guess occasionally they were. It's fun, but clearly stupid fun. So if you're in that kind of mood, no thinking, just watching and laughing, then go for it. But don't say I didn't warn you. Fun but definately not funny."

","I absolutely loved the The Evil Dead, a brilliantly inventive splatter-fest that showed how a low budget needn't be a restriction on creativity; sadly, I found the sequel to be a bit of a disappointment in comparison, being little more than a rehash of the original, only with the horror diluted somewhat by director Sam Raimi's proclivity for slapstick humour. The very last scene in Evil Dead II, where hero Ash (Bruce Campbell) is thrown back in time to defeat a medieval 'deadite', did however offer a glimmer of hope, suggesting that a third chapter might be a little more epic in scope and would expound considerably on the Evil Dead mythos.<br/><br/>Five years after EDII, and I finally got my chance to see how Raimi's vision would pan out, securing tickets to an early screening of Army of Darkness at The London Film Festival; unfortunately, after a long wait in a pub knocking back Jack Daniels, I was completely rat-arsed by the time the performance started. The next morning, all I could recall about the film was the final shot, an impressive post-apocalyptic vista with Ash screaming in dismay at his eventual plight; this excellent bleak ending led me to believe that Raimi had made amends for the predictability and dreadful physical comedy of EDII and that I had just sat totally mullered through a possible future favourite.<br/><br/>When Army of Darkness got its official release, however, a second viewing revealed the film to be far from the inspired horror classic I hoped it to be: instead, I was shocked to find that the Three Stooges inspired buffoonery had taken complete precedence over scares. Army of Darkness was a relatively horror-free effort packed with drawn-out slapstick routines (albeit ones performed by skeletons and miniature evil versions of Ash) and that Ash had been turned into a jerk of massive proportions; worse still, the cool downbeat ending had been replaced by a dreadfully cheesy crowd-pleaser. Grrrrr!<br/><br/>The moral of this tale: if you're a huge fan of the visceral approach of the first film, but didn't care so much for the second, watch Army of Darkness completely blotto.

","Well, one thing you can't possibly say about Sam Raimi's ""Evil Dead"" trilogy would be that it's dull or repetitive! The series went from hardcore horror (""The Evil Dead"") to splatter comedy (""Evil Dead 2"") and this final entry is almost pure slapstick with only an occasional flash of gore. Bruce Campbell, who evolved incredibly as an actor, reprises his role of chainsaw-swinging hero Ash who's now catapulted back in time to somewhere early in the medieval era. In order to get back to his supermarket job in the 20th century, he has to join and train a castle community in their battle against evil. Ash's very own clone leads the evil troops and they largely exist out of walking 'n talking skeletons. ""Army of Darkness"" is a very funny and light-headed film that ignores the horror in favor of funny gimmicks and cheerful swashbuckling. That's not necessarily a bad thing but it's understandable that most people rate it as the least good part of the series. Bruce Campbell, however, is terrific and this definitely is the role that defined him as the ultimate horror icon of the last two decades. Some of his quotes are already considered classic by now (""Hail to the King, Baby"", ""Shop smart. Shop S-Mart"") and most fans are still secretly hoping for a third sequel. The ""March of the Dead""-theme by Danny Elfman is splendid and Sam Raimi's direction is as professional as ever. Unlike the previous Evil Dead installments, ""Army of Darkness"" may not be a genre milestone but it sure remains great fun to watch it over and over again."

He wants to get back to present day (1992) but has to get a book that holds the incantation and battle the evil dead.<br/><br/>Unlike the first time this is R rated--the first 2 were unrated but would have gotten an NC-17 easily. Also unlike the first two the accent here is on humor not horror and the gore is significantly toned down. Also the plot in this one is all over the place. It's fairly simple but Ash is constantly insulting everyone and telling bad jokes. Also it comes to a dead halt sometimes to indulge in some VERY violent (and unfunny) slapstick. The sequence in the windmill and when Ash first encounters the skeletons seem to come from a Three Stooges short! I hate the Three Stooges and I don't think I have to sit through TWO of their routines while watching a horror movie! On the plus side director Raimi had a LOT of money for this one and the special effects are dazzling. The stop-motion skeletons were just a joy to watch. Also Campbell's WAY over the top acting helps the story speed through its dull spots and Embeth Davidtz is very attractive and convincing as the love interest. Also the studio cut has a silly ending (with Bridget Fonda) but the directors cut has a more serious (and better) ending. This one just left me cold while I loved the first two so I can only give it a 5. The slapstick humor and stupid comedic lines were totally out of place in an Evil Dead film."

","Hmmm , a strange film as sequels go since EVIL DEAD 2 was more or less identical to its predecessor while this second sequel is an entire universe away from the original with only the comic book black humour giving a hint that it`s from the same franchise . Unfortunately because it`s set in a pseudo dark ages period it`s impossible not to be reminded of a certain film that was released last Christmas , you know the one where a group of humans are beseiged by dark forces . I said unfortunately because ARMY OF DARKNESS can`t help draw attention to itself for having a pathetically small budget , , the castle is obviously a matte painting in the long shots , many of the exteriors are obviously studio bound while many of the locations seem to have been shot in the Arizona desert . It`s also difficult not to notice how bad the cast are , Bruce Campbell is absolutely painful to watch while the rest of the cast fail to rise above substandard . It`s saying something about a film when the best performances are by skeletons , they really do give a meaty performance ( HA HA HA !) <br/><br/>So I wasn`t too taken with ARMY OF DARKNESS , the fact that I`d seen THE TWO TOWERS a few months previously didn`t help , but it`s really good seeing director Sam Raimi improving beyond all recognition since ARMY OF DARKNESS was made in 1993 and have no doubt he`ll be remembered alongside Peter Jackson as one of the 21st Century`s great film directors"

","Evil Dead is one of my top 10 horror movies of all time and Bruce Campbell as Ash in that was brilliant. Period. Evil Dead 2 did catch me off guard a little with its humour but it was an excellent sequel. I saw Army of Darkness upon its cinematic release back in 1992 and I recall thinking back then that in my opinion it just wasn't an Evil Dead movie, rather a fantasy that stars Ash and uses elements from the original story.
Don't get me wrong, Army is a well made movie. Wonderful sets (though that castle obviously is not English!), lots of action, great effects (more than a nod to Ray Harryhausen) and no end of humour (Monty Python's Holy Grail sprang to mind). This is a horror/fantasy comedy. And that is my problem. Too much of it in my opinion, this movie is all about Bruce Campbell and how much he can squeeze out of Ash. Fans of the character will delight in this but for me he quickly became more tedious than funny. I feel somewhat bad about awarding this 6/10 when I am such a fan of the original but had Ash been somewhat less in your face then I would have scored it higher.
Just finished watching the Director's Cut. I liked the additional material plus the ending (even though it has been ripped from a very well known sci-fi movie!).

The Evil Dead (1981) is the best horror film of all time in my opinion and my favorite horror film of all time. Third movie in the trilogy is alright. It still has a horror elements in, it is mixed with good comedy effects. Bruce Campbell as hero Ash Williams was terrific and excellent in his acting performence. Director Sam Raimi directed this film well. Was the final saga in ""The Evil Dead trilogy.""<br/><br/>This third chapter goes for more of the laughs rather then the scares and actually offers up a fun take on the genre mix director Sam Raimi tells. Ash is now trasnported in to 1300 A.D., in which he has to retrieve the book of the dead Necronomicon while he was searching on the graveyard for the book he accidently says wrong words and he awokes up ""the army of the dead"" and he doomes everyone with that action. While selfish, he wants to go home, but he decides to stay and fight againts the army of the dead.<br/><br/>This was the third and final saga in The Evil Dead trilogy before this movie was rebooted and get the series Ash vs Evil Dead with Bruce Campbell returning his character Ash. Never saw the series before, but Army of Darkness I like. I would say it is a step back from The Evil Dead (1981) movie because I love horror movies this is more lighter tone and more lighter aspect than a horror movie it self.<br/><br/>The problem I had is Bruce Campbell aka Ash dosen't use his chainsaw that much, he only use in the opening scene and that it is. Why this poster has Ash with chainsaw when he barely use it. Ash is iconic with chainsaw and his shootgun not without chainsaw. The third movie is more lighter, not creepy enough and not scary or terrifying enough. That's ym problem with this film. Evil Dead II (1987) is MILES way better movie this isn't.<br/><br/>They are 4 cuts of this film the directors's cut, televison cut, theatrical cut and international cut. I watched years ago Director's Cut I hated it that version of this movie, but Theatrical Cut is a bad-ass. I am glad I have theatrical cut on Blu-ray otherwise I would hate this film. Bruce Campbell also isn't happy with Collector's edition he also dosen't like those cuts on this film.<br/><br/>What can I say the film has a lot of action, good FX stunts, some creepy monsters, funny moments. Bad Ash and the Skeleton army I like that Ash mades weapons in the history. I love his new knight iron hand. I like the ending the finale in which Ash is in the store fighting with monster with his sexy girlfriend Linda. Did not know she was played by Bridget Fonda this time. The theatrical cut has better ending than director's cut (Ash waking up in a post-apocalyptic future where human civilization is destroyed) just dosen't fit in the movie and that scene too me was really disappointment and stupid!<br/><br/>Army of Darkness I like, I have Screwhead Edition on Blu-ray disc and I am still going to watch this movie.

I assume that's what happened to Bridget Fonda, who was reduced to an utterly superfluous cameo at the beginning of the film. Ash's voiceover states that he had a wonderful girlfriend named Linda (played by Fonda), who was taken away by the evil force that invaded their cabin in the woods. Fonda speaks not a word, nor is her character mentioned again after her abduction.<br/><br/>To add insult to injury, once Ash lands in Medieval times, he almost immediately takes up with another woman. Clearly, his mourning period for Linda was short-lived. The film's ending also implies a new love interest for Ash once he's back in the present day.<br/><br/>So I have to ask: why was Bridget Fonda even in this film?

Unfortunately the payoff isn't nearly as appealing as it seems to promise. Ash has been transported through time and has landed within a society of knights and kings. Hilarious opening has Ash narrating being swallowed by a time portal. Central plot regards his quest for the book of the dead so that he may return home as well as prevent a war. Cheesy special effects are distracting with an overlong climax that brings two sides together.

Embeth Davidtz is standard issue as a woman who at first doesn't welcome Ash but she becomes a demon who needs rescued thus paving the road to acceptance.

","A horror comedy, the third in the trilogy of EVIL DEAD films. This one sees Ash, the hero from the first two films, transported back in time to Medieval England as a consequence of the actions occurring at the end of the EVIL DEAD 2. A brief summary of the events in ED2 is shown at the beginning of the film to help those without prior knowledge to understand more fully the events that are going on. From the start Ash is immediately a slave and is forced to fight against a Deadite to prove himself to the King. Luckily, he still has his shotgun and chainsaw with him from ED2 and uses this to full effect in combating the evil. Once defeated, Ash journeys to a distant cemetery in order to retrieve the Necronomicon and return him to his own time. Along the way he finds love which I feel is a rather unnecessary addition to the plot. Ash unwittingly resurrects an army of the dead comprised of skeletons, all led by his twin, Bad Ash. Suffice to say his castle is invaded by these skeletons and Ash and his men must use 20th century technology to defeat this undead horde.<br/><br/>ARMY OF DARKNESS is an amusing comedy with a few horror elements thrown in but compared to the first two films in the trilogy it really isn't all that great. A weakness is that the film tries too hard to be funny and can be embarrassing at times. Another downfall are the enemies, while the stop-motion skeletons look convincing and are reminiscent of THAT classic scene from JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS, most of the time the skeletons are obviously being carried along by guys crawling just below the camera! If, like was originally intended, the army had been composed of zombies then we would have had some great gore scenes, but they decided to tone it down for a PG-13 release and we were left with this. The gore in the first film gave it the reputation it has and look at what has happened now. Good old Bruce does his best, playing straight-faced as always, but he lacks the manic-eyed character he had in EVIL DEAD 2. Still, he's once again a one man show, carrying the plot when it lets him down and making every line a classic, much-quoted piece of cinema history.<br/><br/>The film's main disappointment is in that it tries to cater for a wider audience whereas the low-budget '80s films didn't. It is a disappointing third (and perhaps last) in the series, but saying that it still has some good moments, and I'm only berating it because it's the follow-up to two amazingly good films. If this was a stand alone then I would praise it more highly, but as it is, there's a nasty taste left in the mouth after viewing. The Evil Force (p.o.v. demon chasing through woods) only appears fleetingly but it is still a pleasure to see it. But the setting and the atmosphere of the first pair of horror films are sorely missed, and this feels like a different thing altogether. Although ARMY OF DARKNESS is worth seeing (especially if you're a fan of slapstick), if you are looking for an intense, ferious horror comedy then I would recommend the superior EVIL DEAD 2."

Sure, it is ingrained in our mental movie logic that we have to compare movies to their sequels (so many look indentical) but these two films are so different that it is like comparing apples to oranges. This film depends more on its sense of fun visuals and lightens up on the splatter and that makes all the difference.<br/><br/>'Army of Darkness' picks up exactly were 'Evil Dead II' left off with our hero named Ash (Bruce Campbell) falling from the sky into a medieval world. The land isn't in engulfed in darkness but Ash's soon takes care of that when he is asked to go and retrieve the book of the dead. It required the pronouncement of Klaatu Barada Nikto (you heard that right). But Ash forgets the words and takes the book anyway and he soon finds out the consequences as the armies of the dead rise from their grave and the land is engulfed in the after-mentioned darkness.<br/><br/>The movie is just plain fun. The climax involves a war with Ash and the good people of the land using Ash's chemistry book to build explosives to combat an army of skeletons (just like the ones in Jason and the Argonauts). Director Sam Raimi allows the skeletons a second or two of screen time a piece but manages to give them fun personalities instead of just letting them be menacing.<br/><br/>Like most of Raimi's best work the movie is a work of visual invention. The best scene involves a bend on an old Irish fairy tale as Ash breaks a mirror and the reflection splits in several tiny Ashes who assault him and eventually end up climbing down his throat.<br/><br/>The key to the movie is the chiseled-chin hero played by Bruce Campbell who completely throws his dignity out the window in scenes like the one in which he is assaulted by several skeletal hands at once. He handles certain scenes that other actors would have been too vain to even attempt. He has fun with the dialogue handling lines like 'Hail to the King baby!' with perfect finesse and announcing himself to an opposing zombie as 'Ash, housewares!' 'Army of Darkness' is fun. I like how Raimi goes one step further and doesn't let his scene fall into stogy ordinary action. He does that with his best visual work like this and it's predecessor. I've even seen it in his lesser works. I liked the visual trickery of 'The Quick and the Dead' but longed for something resembling a story. I even saw his skill in his wonderful but overlooked 'The Gift'.<br/><br/>But here somehow all of the elements seem to fall into place just as they did in 'Evil Dead II' even if they aren't the same movie, the fun remains the same."

","Wow, this doesn't happen all the time, probably rarely, but I love a good make-up part three of a trilogy. Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Ocean's Thirteen and Die Hard with a Vengeance come to mind, but now, I will add Army of Darkness.<br/><br/>This is not to say Indy 2, Ocean's 12 or Die Hard'er were terrible, they really weren't, but the third chapter redemption is always refreshing. I will say, however, this does not apply to the Evil Dead (original) trilogy, as Evil Dead II, or The Evil Dead Redux, was just plain atrocious.<br/><br/>Not only was Army of Darkness a fun, exciting and often hilarious movie – thanks, Brucey! – but it's one of those rare sequels that takes the main character from the saga, along with some of the established themes, into a whole new dimension. You couldn't seriously be as far away from the first two chapters in regards to setting, direction or, uh, time period, as Director Sam Raimi took Army of Darkness.<br/><br/>Now, that all said, this wasn't perfect, by any means, and as much as I found it entertaining and original – for the series, that is – it's not a new take on period piece movies with swords, castles and grand scale battles. And as the movie progresses, it fell deeper and deeper into old film clichés.<br/><br/>Almost taking place immediately following the events in part II – and I emphasize the word almost, because they seemed to either forget what exactly happened at the end of the last chapter, or they wrote themselves into a corner previously and they hoped no one would notice, Ash (played wonderfully and hysterically by Bruce Campbell) is taken prisoner in the 1300s after being sucked into a vortex that was meant to rid present day of the ""evil dead.""<br/><br/>Without so much as a trial or sentencing, he's just tossed into a well of hell and, in good old fashioned Ash-way, he proves himself and lives. Some claim him to be a prophesied warrior ""from the sky"" to rid the land of evil by retrieving the same book that sent him back in time in the first place. Also, Ash-like, he'd much rather save himself and get back in (the right) time than help the villagers.<br/><br/>Ash must survive the evil dark lands/cemetery and it's amusing incarnations and bring back the book. Will Ash save his own ash, or care about other ash's when all hell breaks loose after his book journey?<br/><br/>Recently, in 2013, the remake (well, second remake, if you rightfully count the second installment as the first reboot) came out and, I'll take a guess, since I won't be seeing it for another few hours, reinvents the first wheel. My hope is that they follow that up with a remake of this, for, while this was often witty and had some pretty decent lines, I can see an even better version of this. There seemed to be a lot of missed opportunities by the writers and I stand behind them spending a little more time to get this even more hilarious.<br/><br/>Also, I am not always a fan of the ""Director's Cut"" of films. Granted, I applaud them for being able to show us their true and verified visions, but mostly, I find when a director takes advice from either crew members, or sneak-peak audience members, it's just plain good advice. In this case, unfortunately, I only had the ""Director's Cut"" to see and I recalled a different ending. While this one (no spoilers) was decent, and actually makes sense in regards to the events leading up to the end, it was a too-quick resolution. I YouTubed the original theatrical ending, found what I remembered seeing this many years ago when I first saw this and felt that one was longer, funnier, more exciting and deserved to be in all ""cuts"" of the film. Seriously, Raimi, how could you think your ""cut"" was better than the theatrical one?<br/><br/>Both endings worked, but, again, I prefer the original's. I digress. Even if you hadn't seen the first two movies, and I would highly recommend the first one of two only, this almost stand-alone is well worth your time for a little early 90s campy fun.<br/><br/>And who can go wrong with the great Bruce Campbell at his best?*<br/><br/>* - In comparison, his worst was just one movie back, Evil Dead II."

","The first film was brilliant, the second film was okay but mostly a rehash, and here the trilogy, if that's what you can call it, comes to an end, from director Sam Raimi (Spider-Man). Basically it continues from where the last film left off (although the events he lands in changes), where discount store employee Ash (Bruce Campbell) was pulled into a time vortex by the evil forces to land in medieval times, the year 1300 A.D. He is at first mistaken by Lord Arthur (Marcus Gilbert) and Sheila (Embeth Davidtz) as an enemy, but he proves his worth defending himself against the evil forces with his ""boomstick"" and becomes a saviour from prophecies. He is chosen as the man who will go on a quest to find the Necronomicon, the book (similar to the Book of the Dead) that will rid the land of the evil. He was meant to memorise the phrase ""Klaatu barada nikto"""" (the same phrase from The Day the Earth Stood Still), and when he screws it up it releases a more vicious evil, starting with tiny versions and a copy of himself. This Evil Ash he chops up, but it puts itself back together to become the leader of the Army of the Dead (or Darkness), consisting of loads of skeletons from the graveyard. In the end, after Ash led the army that did defeat the evil army, and getting close to Sheila, he did get to return to his own time, returning to the discount store, and killing another dead creature. Also starring Ian Abercrombie as Wiseman, Richard Grove as Duke Henry the Red, Michael Earl Reid as Gold Tooth, Timothy Patrick Quill as Blacksmith, Bridget Fonda as Linda, Patricia Tallman as Possessed Witch and Ted Raimi as Cowardly Warrior / Second Supportive Villager / S-Mart Clerk. Campbell is still reasonable as the now braver but still less tolerant victim warrior, the tongue and cheek gory moments and effects has some laughable moments, but you just know the first film will always be the best one, and this is just another near repeat, a not too terrible horror fantasy comedy. Okay!"

Everything combined to suspend disbelief most effectively, transporting the viewer back in time by presenting a movie that seems like it might actually have been made using 14th-century technology.<br/><br/>Seriously- I don't think this is the work that won Raimi the job of directing Spider-Man, but he and Campbell seem to have been having a great time.

","Army of Darkness is nothing like the first two evil dead movies. It has no gore, different setting, and isn't even a horror movie. It is like an action/comedy. I knew it would have a tiny bit more comedy, but I didn't think they would drain out all of the horror. They have really bad special effects, like when someone got stabbed you could tell so much that it was just like the knife you would get for halloween that goes in when you press it against something and out when you took it away, you could even see and hear it going out. I think they meant to for a comedic reason, but it got a little annoying. I just couldn't get into it, and it was pretty predictable too.

","Highly enjoyable, fairly mindless, funny addition to Sam Raimi's Evil Dead series - the third and last installment and easily the best and most engaging of the three as well. Bruce Campbell is back with a slightly different character motivation and past, but Campbell relies on his quick reflexes, both physical and mental, that made him famous in the first two Evil Dead movies as Ash and kicks it up not just a notch but three or four. Here he is obviously parodizing his character and those of adventure/horror films of the era. He is a walking one-liner amidst hokey plot contrivances, imaginative special effects(for its time bear in mind), and some pretty mediocre acting talents. But none of that really matters because Campbell and Raimi are out to make you laugh and Army of Darkness is no more a horror film than Fatal Attraction is a romantic comedy. Raimi is agile and adroit with the camera and innovative. I really liked the walking skeletons in the battle scenes, and Raimi gives them ludicrous lines to say to make sure no one confuses this with anything more than what it is intended to be. Campbell shines as he always does as a bigger-than-life persona with lots of comedic ability. The scene with the books was a real hoot as were his multiple fights with various demons. Though part of the Evil Dead series, this really has virtually nothing to do with the other two except for some names that are the same and some plot elements that allow Campbell to run, shout, contort himself in most amusing ways."

The plot summary, that a man falls back in time and ends up leading an army of knights and surfs against the 'army of darkness', should have given enough scope to create a memorable and enjoyable film. Unfortunately that was not to be. The characters remain paper thin and the plot lacks any depth of interest and is too simple and obvious. With what must have been a limited budget the effects are limited, but that would be OK if the plot and the characters engaged you. Its a relief to get to the end of the film.

"MatBrewster","7","0","2","3 May 2005"," Better Than he First, Not As Good As The Second
","Army of Darkness is the third (and so far final) movie in the Evil Dead Series. Before director Sam Raimi went legit with a series of critically acclaimed dramas and the Spiderman series, he was a low budget horror genius. Army of Darkness begins right where Evil Dead II ended, with Bruce Campbell trapped in medieval times to battle the deadites once again.<br/><br/>The trilogy started out in Evil Dead as a pretty straight horror movie. A group of people discover a book of the dead and unleash gore filled horror upon themselves in a remote cabin. Evil Dead II basically re-tells the same story with a different cast (except for the ever present Bruce Campbell), bigger budget and plenty of slapstick. The second movie is by far my favorite in the series. It keeps the ghoulish gore while adding hilarious physical comedy and some classic one liners. Army of Darkness furthers this tradition by adding even more slap stick and one lines while removing almost all of the gore.<br/><br/>What little plot there is goes something like this: Stranded in the middle ages Bruce Campbell is at first captured by a small army for being mistaken for a member of a rival army. Bruce quickly uses his ""boomstick"" to gain clout with his captors and is sent on a quest to recover the Necronomicon which will both send Bruce back to his own time and save the army from evil. Bruce being Bruce he gets the book and unleashes an army of the dead. There are two endings released for this movie. One happier ending was released in US theatres and another sequel set up unhappy ending seen in a theatrical cut in the UK and on many US DVD versions.<br/><br/>Raimi once again does a nice job creating a mix of horror movie cliché's (which range from Jason and the Argonauts to Gulliver's Travels) with the slapstick of the Three Stooges. Unfortunately the comic elements seem to take over this picture leaving the horror end of it as more of a backdrop. It feels more like a Zucker brother's movie more than a horror film. Most of the evil dead are formed as skeletons which only crumble when destroyed rather than burst into a mess of blood and guts as they did in the first two movies. This may seem to be an absurd complaint, but as a fan of gory movies I felt disappointed with that choice.<br/><br/>The cinematography is actually quite well done throughout most of the picture. My DVD copy is actually quite beautiful in scenes. Especially the exterior shots around the windmill. The use of color and lighting is well above par for most horror films. The pre CGI special effects effect the quality of the print in several areas, but still hold up as goofy Raimi effects. I kept thinking the picture was too pretty for what was actually taking place on screen. Bruce Campbell once again does a nice job of making Ash come to life. He delivers his lines with the comic timing of a comedian while still delivering enough pain to make his albeit over-the-top beatings believable. The rest of the cast is hardly memorable as characters or for their acting.<br/><br/>Army of Darkness still makes a nice end to the trilogy. In a way it makes a nice bookend to Evil Dead's pure gore horror with the single middle book being a mix between bloody gore and slapstick comedy."

","""Army of Darkness"" is different from most movies I see, as I'm not really into the whole comedy genre.  I had heard a whole lot about the movie from a whole bunch of people who loved it, but I wasn't convinced that a low-budget movie with an evil force that makes people go back in time would be worth my time.  And, for the most part, it wasn't.  <br/><br/>Yes, ""Army of Darkness"" does have its funny moments, but it wasn't laugh-out-loud hilarious.

But the movie, although the claymation is good and the cinematography decent, just isn't really that exciting.<br/><br/>In conclusion, watch ""Army of Darkness"" if you want a few laughs and you like spoofs.

"mysteriousbhat","4","0","5","13 November 2003"," The Right Approach
","The special effects in this movie are not grand and it was best that Sam Raimi made comedy more of a priority than horror. There is nothing more funnier than seeing Bruce Campbell shoot down skeletons with a shotgun and crack one-liners.<br/><br/>""Army of Darkness"" is the biggest of the Evil Dead movies. The budget exceeds the first two movies combined and it shows on screen. Bruce Campbell is shown in a different light again, this time as a ruggedly, handsome superhero. This approach is the best of the trilogy and displays Campbell's wide range of skills as an actor.<br/><br/>One complaint about ""Army of Darkness"" was the three mini-copies of Ash. The scene took well over twenty minutes and definitely took away what basis of humor the film held. The scene signified the comic horror movie to an overt humor fiesta. Thankfully, the film got back on track after a few more scenes.<br/><br/>By excitement, this movie ranks first. But by craftiness, Evil Dead II knocks out the rest. One must think why this intriguing, exciting horror series died out while others like Jason and Michael Myers has continued. Let's just hope Raimi gets Campbell back for one more ride because it would be worth it.<br/><br/>The question mark I had in ""Evil Dead II"" about the chainsaw man in the 13th century has finally been answered with an exclamation point and Bruce Campbell brings it with a punch. Worst of the series but that should not be taken as a negative."
"Angry_Arguer","Null","0","2","1 November 2003"," It'll Swallow Your Soul
","I loathe mindless entertainment junkies because they are more concerned about letting their collective brain cells deteriorate rather than do some critical analysis.<br/><br/>Why is Sam Raimi great?  Because he invests everything into the camera and its movement and nothing else.  Perhaps effects are the only thing that come after the cinematography.  That said, Army of Darkness concludes his ""Evil"" frame of mind.<br/><br/>Whereas ED2 parodies the horror cliches of the 70s and 80s and insults the pop genre surrounding them, ""Army"" tries to create its own pop influence. Needless to say, it's all too obvious in our culture now.  It is more coherent and slicker than its predecessor, but there's something wrong.  ED2 felt experimental and out-of-control, where anything possible could (and often did) happen.  Here it feels too formulaic, too mainstream.  As with the predecessor, we see more of the same with an even bigger emphasis on comedy.<br/><br/>I consider this Raimi's third best movie.  It is better than ED1, Darkman, Spider-Man, and the Gift, but still has some lacking qualities in the bizarre department compared to ED2 and the Quick and the Dead.  When it comes down to a challenge between Raimi and Tim Burton, though, I'll stay with Raimi.<br/><br/>Overall, despite being destructive to the social thought world, Army of Darkness is more referencing and appealing to the adolescents.  2.5 out of 5."

Poor old Ash has been stuck in a cabin with a bunch of murderous deadites for two nights and has now been catapulted back in time to the year 1300ad.  To put it bluntly, he's having a bad week.
