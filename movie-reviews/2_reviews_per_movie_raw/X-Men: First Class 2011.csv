","With Matthew Vaughn at the helm, X-Men: First Class is a classy, fun time that brings the best out of it's strong cast. The action scenes and dialogue pop with a ferocity, and breaths life into a incredibly engaging storyline."
"rachel-673-19946","9","474","606","26 May 2011"," A prequel that does not, in any way, suck. Amazing, isn't it?
","There came a point, about half way through this film, when I emerged from the world of wonder on screen, took stock of my emotions in that instant, and realized that yes, by God, I am LOVING this movie.<br/><br/>I didn't really expect to, of course -- although certainly, I hoped for it. With such an incredible cast, an able director at the helm, a story of Bryan Singer provenance and the inclusion of some of my favorite, if lesser known, X-types (Darwin! Tempest! Havok!), I was eager to see this beloved band of merry Marvel mutants redeem themselves after the massive failures of X3 and X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE.<br/><br/>Which they do. And how!<br/><br/>One thing that the avid comic fan must do when approaching this movie, however, is to divorce themselves utterly from almost all established four-color X-Men continuity. Oh, some bears up, but by and large this is a whole new origin story, a reboot of epic proportions, and yet it is a retcon so cleverly done, and one that offers up a such a delicious mélange of complex relationships and sensible motivation, that all of the many discrepancies inherent in having Mystique on the side of good or having Moira McTaggert a CIA agent simply do not matter. <br/><br/>Speaking of McTaggert, Rose Byrne is both comely and convincing in the role, and almost every other actor is perfectly, one might almost say forcefully, cast. McAvoy brings a kind of laddish charm to Charles Xavier that he mixes nicely with both decency and naïveté, and Michael Fassbender's nascent Magneto is relentlessly, even heart-breakingly, compelling. Their chemistry is electric -- theirs' is one of the most multi-faceted and sincere bromances the screen has seen in a good long while.<br/><br/>The younger cast all impress, though particular praise must go to Oscar-nominee Jennifer Lawrence as the petulant but pitiable Raven/Mystique (The Academy Awards have been good to young, hot X-chicks; let us not forget that Rogue herself, Anna Paquin, won for THE PIANO). Former child star Nicholas Hoult is also outstanding as the troubled Hank McCoy, and perhaps the most surprising kudos must go to teenage dream Lucas Till, who conveys the particular anti-social asshole-hood of the turbulent Alex Summers very convincingly indeed.<br/><br/>The biggest letdown in the movie, acting-wise, is January Jones as Emma Frost. True, she is appropriately ravishing, there can be no denying that, but she lacks the the zing of the written character. There is very little intelligence, snark, or even personality behind her interpretation of this most intriguing of mutants; she's just kind of Stand There and Look Pretty -- which, for one playing Emma Frost, is something a travesty.<br/><br/>The only other weight under which this movie really labors is the fact that it is a prequel, and it therefore suffers from the feeling of inevitability that besets all such endeavors. Anakin Skywalker HAS to go Dark Side. Bilbo Baggins HAS to find the One Ring. And Magneto HAS to turn against humans; Mystique HAS to join him; Xavier HAS to end up in a wheelchair. With these definite plot developments looming, their eventuation is bound to be a bit of an anti-climax.<br/><br/>And yet the fun part about X-MEN: FIRST CLASS is the journey it takes us on to get us there. Offering up plenty of surprises, some kickass action sequences, mighty fine special effects, sly humor and a killer cameo, it is without doubt the best comic book movie of the year – nay, decade – thus far. And considering how overcrowded that list is, this is really saying Something.<br/><br/>Huh. A prequel that does not, in any way, suck.<br/><br/>Amazing, isn't it?<br/><br/>-- Rachel Hyland, geekspeakmagazine.com"
"McGrit","Null","200","272","31 May 2011"," X Marks again marks the spot! Great Film!
","There are plenty of big action scenes throughout but it's the first half of the film that really impresses. Establishing these characters and the entire universe is done remarkably well and in a remarkably moving manner. This new spin on familiar ""bad guys"" Magneto and Mystique does give the actions and emotions for the characters a new level of appreciation and helps give them so much more depth and pathos. Both sides of the fence (Xavier's vision and Magneto's contempt) are advanced and the brilliance of the plot is that both sides are understandable and relatable. The viewer can simply sit and watch it unfold but also be emotionally invested in the journey. During the second half, plot threads move towards resolution and action picks up. Xavier is a shining example and his journey throughout the film matches that of Erik.<br/><br/>First Class never undermines the audience nor talks down to them and does all that is expected of it. It delivers great action, humor, effects and a strong connection between heroes, villains and those developing in between. The retro design is suave and making this a period piece gives it a cool and unique flavor. The collaboration between Singer and Vaughn apparently was a perfect blend. Vaughn did a brilliant job and Singer's vision from the first two films stayed in tact and was enhanced. I have to add that the score had a perfect heroic theme but was also moving and very well done. The overall impact of this film leaves you with a great sensation of a job well done. Fast paced yet filled with depth, spellbinding visual effects and a gripping finale. In the end, they succeeded in re-establishing these characters in a superb and interesting manner. There is more to offer and more depth to appreciate. I certainly can't wait for a sequel and inclusion of Scott and Jean from the original trilogy."
"Logan8888","Null","352","499","24 May 2011"," Grand-Scale Storytelling Mixed With Superb Action
","Fox can breath easy again because I think it's safe to say the even the extreme fanboys will be putting down their pitchforks and torches and smile after seeing this amazing film. I know for a fact that general audiences are going to love this movie. I know some fans can be irrational and hold on to their hate because they expect certain things they read in their books but I can't seeing anyone being that irrational when faced with a result that delivers what First Class manages to deliver. It honestly is a genre-defining movie on a level with any comic based film that has come before it. Everything in this movie is exceedingly better than what Fox delivered in their last two efforts with this franchise. Going back to the beginning and re-hiring the guy that brought us those films was a splendid idea. The acting here is superb and the dialogue is rich. Every character feels absolutely believable no matter what abilities they have on display. No cartoonish villains or cheese in sight, every side of the issue is presented by people who believe they are the ones who are in the right and the underlying message of tolerance and bigotry only add to the depth of this film. If not a genre-defining movie than maybe it redefines the comic book genre. It restores the sense of epic adventure and grand-scale storytelling that we saw in X2. In fact, it perfectly complements that great film and probably surpasses it.<br/><br/>This film is to X2 what Godfather 2 was to the Godfather. Seriously, First Class is an exceptional ""flashback"" look that links the best of the X-Men trilogy to the past. Instead of DeNiro playing young Vito Corleone we get James McAvoy as young Charles Xavier. Marlon Brando and Patrick Stewart made their respective characters popular but both were more fleshed out by incredible younger talent. I'm not placing the X-Men film itself on a par with the Godfather but both have become legendary in their particular genre. I am, however, saying McAvoy has a bright future as a complex and talented actor. Just like the young cast of Godfather 2 was legendary, the young cast of First Class has many great days and projects ahead of them.<br/><br/>Love this entire cast but Michael Fassbender delivers the best performance with an amazing presence and command of the screen. Everyone was extraordinary. What many expected indeed happens. By that I mean every scene that Fassbender and McAvoy are in together absolutely sing. It won't surprise anyone to know that Kevin Bacon, Oliver Platt and Jennifer Lawrence are superb in supporting roles but Nicholas Hoult did stunning work as the Beast and deserves some love as well. January Jones and Rose Byrne are hot as can be but aren't just simple eye candy. Sure, the story is compelling and the action is amazing but the performances elevate this movie far above a common summer flick.<br/><br/>Movie of the year so far..."
"RikerDonegal","10","295","425","1 June 2011"," Superb! Rock-solid script, two amazing lead performances (the film is basically a bromance).
","What you need to know about this movie before you go and see it.  1. Michael Fassbender and James McAvoy are superb. Each one, alone,  would have made the movie terrific, but together? Forgetaboutit! Every  step of the way, every scene, every emotion, these two men own the  movie and watching their bromance is a treat from start to finish. Make  no mistake about it, even when the world is on the brink of utter  destruction what really matters is how these two men relate to one  another. And when you watch the movie, you will care.  2. Everyone in the cast is good. Kevin Bacon has never been better, and  Jennifer Lawrence is wonderful. Rose Byrne and January Jones aren't  given much to do, Ray Wise and Michael Ironside only have a few short  lines, but - across the board - the entire cast are a delight.  3. The story is tight. You've got a bad guy with a plan, which he sets  about executing in A/B/C fashion. Against him, the good guys work  together. Their motivations are different, of course, but they pretty  much want him stopped so they unite. That's it.  4. Charles and Erik are fascinating characters. They debate. And  viewers can debate endless about them, and about who is right, etc. As  you watch you desperately wish they could stay friends, but you  understand why they ultimately can't. Even if they themselves, in these  early days, don't understand it yet. To have that so perfectly captured  in a Summer Blockbuster movie is part of what makes this a treat and a  future classic. But, aside from their relationship to each other, the  movie takes time to make each of them interesting in his own right. We  get to see Charles as a teacher, for instance, and come to understand  how he impacts upon the lives of those he tutors. Some of Erik's best  moments (away from Charles) are in his comments to Mystique about her  appearance, making it clear that this man has more to him than the  shadow of his past.  4. Most supporting characters have very little screen time. But that's  okay, since this isn't THEIR story, really. Of the bunch, it is  Mystique and Beast who are best served. Both have terrific character  arcs that - in a lesser X-Men movie - might have been the highlight of  the film. Here, their stories serve as quality background material to  the main event (Charles and Erik). Beyond that, we just learn enough  about everyone to know what they can do and like them a little bit,  mostly through their banter and most obvious character traits. Once  scene where most of the supporting characters are clearly terrified  will certainly go a long way towards making you care about them for the  rest of the movie. On the downside: Shaw's two henchmen don't get  ANYTHING to do except use their powers, and at the end of the story we  know as much about Emma Frost as we did at the beginning. But these are  the exception, not the rule.  5. Visually, this movie is a treat. The FX are good, no surprise, but -  much better - the actual sets/costumes are beautiful. Whether it's a  remote CIA lab or a lap-dance club, whether it's the Magneto helmet or  Mystique's everyday clothes, you are always admiring 'the look' of  what's on screen.  6. There are action scenes all during the movie, but - having said that  - the movie builds as it goes. The first half is more  story-heavy/character-heavy so that when the action REALLY starts we  care about everyone. And, again, it works. Even with the scant details  given their characters, when Banshee and Havok (for example) go into  battle you are invested in them to a certain degree.  7. There are surprises. Deaths, betrayals, cameos and name-dropping.  But, as well as being cool, all of this makes perfect sense for the  story/universe of the movies.  Superb! Rock-solid script, two amazing lead performances (the film is  basically a bromance). Haven't been this excited about the X-Men  franchise since X2: X-Men United."
"the_rattlesnake25","8","146","208","2 June 2011"," A franchise is reborn...
","Beginning with a crime-thriller and a fantasy film on his directorial résumé, it is safe to say that Matthew Vaughn may have already found his niche genre in the super-hero field despite only directing four films in seven years. His first super-hero project, 'Kick Ass,' opened in 2010 to solid critical acclaim and a finalized gross of three times the film's ordinary $30 million dollar budget. And after only two years, Vaughn returns with 'X-Men: First Class,' an origins story to accompany the Bryan Singer/Brett Ratner X-Men trilogy released between 2000 and 2006. It's intelligent, enthralling, well-acted, stylishly directed, and most importantly by focusing heavily upon the relationship between the two central protagonists, it does not feel like a conventional super-hero film.<br/><br/>Set within the political context of the Cuban Missile Crisis in the early 1960's, Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) is an up-and-coming Professor whose life is drastically altered when he is introduced to the other members of society who also share the same mutant gene as himself that supplies them with super-human abilities and traits. After stumbling upon the shape-shifting Raven (Jennifer Lawrence) within his mansion, the telepathic Xavier then encounters Erik Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender), the son of Jewish parents who were murdered during the holocaust by the narcissistic former Nazi scientist, Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon). Erik, who can manipulate all metal objects around himself, wants retribution and nothing more from Sebastian who is now a successful and evil underground figurehead who commands a team of mutants (Azazel, Emma Frost and Riptide) to do his bidding for him. But, once his plan for world domination is revealed, they find that it far exceeds the constraints of humanity, and Xavier, Erik and a rag-tag band of young, hide-away mutants (Havok, Beast, Darwin, Angel and Banshee) who were discovered by Charles, must combine their powers in one last attempt to stop Shaw from destroying the planet and humanity as a whole.<br/><br/>Instantly where 'X-Men: First Class' works is in regards to its two central characters; Charles Xavier played by an incredibly affluently sounding James McAvoy and a rage-fuelled Erik Lehnsherr played by a stern-faced Michael Fassbender. Their instant on-screen chemistry provides the drive and ammunition for the plot to carry itself forward. Both characters have differing ideologies and their constant clashes due to this aspect allow the script to be brought to life. Instead of simply infusing their relationship with formulaic violent clashes, Vaughn has instead opted for more articulated verbal battles between the two characters regarding their stance within the society they are now becoming a part of. Xavier is an intellectual being who believes that humans will eventually be accepted within society as equals alongside humans, while Lenhsherr believes that mutants will always be hunted and unable to live peacefully side-by-side with the human race, his evidence for this resides in the anti-Semitism and hatred he received at the hands of the Nazi party during the holocaust. This heavy-set contradiction in ideologies allows their relationship to be imbued with pessimism, while they may be shown as friends and fighting together initially, fans of the comic books and films in general know this does eventually turn into a bitter rivalry and it's this development which drives the plot forward.<br/><br/>Aside from the script, it would also be rude to not praise the action-sequences which take place within the confines of the 1960's X-Men universe. With a modest running time at two hours and ten minutes, there are more than a few well-choreographed action sequences that would adequately satisfy any of comic-book-to-film aficionado's wishing to see this film. Each character's power or ability is at some point represented in a destructive or defensive capacity, taking full advantage of the fact that while many super-hero movies tend to concentrate on the aesthetic nature of the artillery characters can be seen to withstand from governmental agencies or blindsided human opponents, here it is shown and constantly emphasized that human reaction would be futile due to the overwhelming power the mutants possess. These scenes also allow the less important characters to show their physical presence on-screen. For example, during the climactic fight sequence at the conclusion of the film, every mutant character that is identified to the audience is finally shown using their abilities to full capacity, most notably the henchmen of Shaw and the rag-tag team of Xavier and Lehnsherr. This therefore accounts slightly for the lack of depth that has been attempted in these secondary characters due to the time and story constraints.<br/><br/>While it is a very good and accessible comic-book/super-hero movie, 'X-Men' does also contain two central flaws. The first is superseded in a way by the strength of both McAvoy and Fassbenders performances, as Kevin Bacon is constantly overshadowed as the one-dimensional antagonist of the piece. His plot to ultimately destroy humanity becomes second fiddle to the ever intricate complex relationship between Xavier and Lehnsherr, and his appearance seems too modelled upon that of a James Bond villain. He has the slick hair, the beautiful women and the villainous underground Club to boot, but Bacon unfortunately doesn't have the charisma to be accepted as a worthy opponent to the protagonists. The other flaw has to do with a minor aspect of the production itself, as the non-diegetic music, most notably during the action sequences, begins to diminish in its impact as the film carries on, leading to it eventually becoming the generic, genre-related fanfare associated with the conventional comic-book films.<br/><br/>'X-Men: First Class,' is not your typical comic-book movie, it may contain certain elements associated with the comic-book genre, but by placing a heavy emphasis upon the strength of the plot and the script at the film's core instead of the action-set-pieces taking place, Vaughn has intended, and succeeded, in transcending the stereotypical conventions of the genre and has created a film which will appeal to a wide range of audience members."
"wafeys","9","75","110","3 June 2011"," Almost pitch-perfect!.... An X-tremely good job!
","What stands out in this movie (besides the look of some of the mutants), is the clever way in which all the pieces fall into place as a prequel which cements the backdrop and tone for the previous X-men offers. This one however, stands above them though for the consideration and tact that has gone into developing these understandably complex characters. Resulting in a more complete movie experience.<br/><br/>The leading cast do a brilliant job in giving you a sense of their conflict with ingredients such as prejudice, ignorance, a sense of belonging and bitter revenge giving the film a more humane feel than a lot of dramas allowing you to connect with the characters more easily.<br/><br/>The special effects- lets not forget, are top notch as expected, but surprisingly very in-keeping with the film and doesn't take away from the other elements of it. The violence is clean but present, pitched right between a young and adult audience. There's also a decent amount of ironic humour thrown in, which, considering the party tricks on offer (by that I mean the powers and peculiarities of the mutants), just comes and goes naturally without feeling forced as like a lot of comedy moments in films of late.<br/><br/>Bottom-line, this is a well-constructed, well acted Marvel film. I wasn't totally convinced beforehand, casting James McAvoy as the young Xavier, a full head of hair and northern accent doesn't seem the best fit after all. I can say that he fully realised that role and showed his range in playing a more commanding lead. Michael Fassbender has great screen presence and does a good shift as the Magneto to-be and Mr Bacon adds another interesting element to the story. All the supporting cast give a solid performance with everyone focused on the exciting job at hand and no weak links.<br/><br/>Easily worth the cinema admission and thank god they didn't make it in hit-and-miss 3d, there's just no need! The best of the X-men franchise."
"jacobmounter","9","171","274","1 June 2011"," Best Xmen film yet!
","Xmen: First Class is simply fantastic. Strong emotion and explosive action. The acting is top notch. Delivery from every actor is at it's best, more so from Mystique, Beast, Xavier and Magneto. <br/><br/>The story is more character based than action, however the action sequences are still superb. Personally i'd have liked to of seen it being a 15 and have a more adult but it wasn't a big issue. Also some more background story from the bad super's would have been good but again this wasn't too much of an issue and would leave some nice room for upcoming xmen movies. <br/><br/>I don't want to say too much but to break it down... Go see this film no matter what you are into. There is something for everyone. 9/10 easy"
"Joejoesan","8","95","149","27 May 2011"," The best prequel movie ever made... period
","Normally prequel movies are made because the main characters of the first movie died (or in the end achieved their goals) and the producers still want to make money out of the franchise. Think Butch Cassidy & The Sundance Kid, Psycho, the (still to be made?) I am legend and of course George Lucas's Star Wars saga. X-Men First Class also falls into that category, but I cannot imagine that anybody will be complaining about that. Director Matthew Vaughn created a great, thrilling and sometimes even moving picture that without any doubt will get raving reviews and be a huge commercial success. God knows both movie and director deserve it.<br/><br/>What makes X-Men First Class really work is the great story. It tells us about the beginning of the mutants and especially the friendship between professor X (a charming James McAvoy) and Erik Lensherr/Magneto (an impressive Michael Fassbender). Although they will drift apart at some time, you know that they will always have respect for each other. In this stage they even become close friends. <br/><br/>The movie opens during World War 2, when young boy Erik is taken to a concentration camp (like the opening of the first X-Men movie). There he meets Sebestian Shaw (a great Kevin Bacon), a scary Joseph Mengele-like scientist who likes to experiment on Jews and is especially interested in mutants. In order to force Erik into helping him he shoots his mother. Erik never forgives him for that and spends his whole life looking for revenge. Unfortunately he learns that Shaw is also a mutant. The scientist is even so powerful that it's almost impossible for Erik to kill him. Luckily he bumps into Charles Xavier...<br/><br/>What I also like about First Class is that the movie takes place in the past (the sixties) and uses historical events (the Cuba crisis and the Cold War) to make its point. Erik claims that no matter how many times mutants save the world, normal people will always see them as enemies. Professor X still wants to believe in the good of the people. With that message the foundation is laid for X-Men 1-3.<br/><br/>The performances in First Class are first rate. Kevin Bacon is a brilliant villain. His German is actually quite good and his opening scene can already be considered as a classic. He also speaks Russian in the movie by the way. Michael Fassbender (Magneto) represents the most exciting drama in the story. He's kinda like Darth Vader. You know he will turn to the Dark Side but you still hope that somehow he will stick with professor X.<br/><br/>First Class will be the beginning of super stardom for actress Jennifer Lawrence. She plays Raven in the story, a girl Xavier adopts as a real sister/best friend. She later becomes Mystique. Jennifer won critical acclaim with her role in Winter Bone and will play the lead in the much anticipated The Hunger Games movie, to be released in 2012. She is a great, vulnerable Mystique who later on chooses Magneto over 'her brother' Professor X. <br/><br/>So what's more to tell? January Jones as Emma Frost is sexy as hell, the special effects in the movie are great and there are not one but two cameos from actors from the first X-Men movie (and no, the second one is not Patrick Stewart). Unlike previous Marvel movies there is no extra scene after the end credits and Stan Lee does not have a small part in this one. Overall First Class makes you think of the Sean Connery Bond movies and the reboot of Star Trek (2009).<br/><br/>So... are you convinced? Just go see this excellent movie. Can't wait for its sequel!<br/><br/>9/10"
"mad_mandonna","8","104","172","1 June 2011"," Clever, exciting, funny and stylish. What more could you want?
","I love the Xmen, I won't beat around the bush. There are so many mutants, heroes and anti-heroes that you relate can to at least one of them. The franchise has had its ups and downs. The first two films made the superhero genre what it is today. Stunning set pieces, breath taking special effects and a group dynamic that was brilliantly cemented in the second film. The third struck a middle ground where the spectacle overshadowed the narrative but was still a fun ride, and the last title Xmen Origins: Wolverine, was the only miss-step in the series. Xmen first Class is really very good. It manages to keep up with the first two whilst retaining an originality in its own right.<br/><br/>The Direction is great, Vaughn's clearly got a knack for angles and keeping the audience engaged whilst the story chops and changes. The look of the film is modern, yet still has a 60's and almost retro look about it. The special effects are very good, though some how not quite up there with Xmen: The Last Stand. The energy is fast and relentless and the action sequences blend in with the dialogue sequences seamlessly.<br/><br/>The acting is very good, though Patrick Stewart and Ian Mckellen are definitely missed, McAvoy and Fassbender do excellent jobs and really are in keeping with the characters you already know and love. Emma Frost and Sebastian Shaw are deliciously malevolent and Moira Mctaggart is perfectly pitched. My only reservation about the acting in the film is of Mystique, who I believe wasn't quite right, her motives in the film don't seem in complete continuity with the rest of the films.<br/><br/>A sequel has already been planned and I shall be eagerly awaiting it. Having Storm back in the series would be a personal highlight for myself, but not necessary. I would highly recommend this film to anyone that has watched the original films and even for newcomers.<br/><br/>One thing I will add that I have noticed since watching the original trilogy is that in 1980 Charles is walking, but according to First Class he loses this ability in the 60's..."

"moviexclusive","9","71","118","1 June 2011"," A first-class summer blockbuster that packs awesome action, great character drama and outstanding lead performances to restore the X Men franchise back to glory
","The X Men movies followed a similar trajectory to another Marvel property ""Spiderman""- the first movie was a surprising blast, the second built on the merits of the first to deliver ever bigger and better thrills, but the third just knocked the wind out of the sails. And so like any self-respecting franchise would do, you go back to the beginning and start all over again- well, in this case, much much further back to the beginning.<br/><br/>The director with the unenviable task of rebooting one of the premier Marvel superhero titles is Matthew Vaughn, best known for subverting the genre last summer with the cult favourite ""Kick-Ass"". Here Vaughn tucks away the subversion for some mainstream summer entertainment and boy does he do a bang-up, and I would say, kick-ass job reviving the franchise.<br/><br/>Sure, it probably isn't as fresh as the first ""X Men"", nor as insanely brilliant as ""X2 United"", but Vaughn exceeds all expectations in creating an origins story that captures the heart of what the series was all about. But to do so, Vaughn has gone way back to the 1960s when the United States and Russia were locked in a Cold War and the prospect of World War III came so imminent with the Cuban Missile Crisis.<br/><br/>Vaughn in fact begins his story much earlier with a prologue that establishes the childhood days of Charles Xavier and Erik Lehnsherr. Whereas Charles grew up in an affluent but isolated stately home in New York, Erik was locked up in a concentration camp in Poland. It is there Erik first meets the Auschwitz doctor Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon), who kills Erik's mother in plain sight of him in order to get him to demonstrate his powers. The contrast is key- it is ultimately their childhood circumstances that will have far-reaching repercussions on their divergent paths in life later on.<br/><br/>And so while Charles becomes an Oxford academic on genetics and envisions a world where humans and mutants can live in harmony with one another, Erik is plotting his revenge against Shaw and cynical of the very utopia Charles cherishes. But when the fate of the world hangs by a nuclear thread, the two find a common enemy- together with the CIA no less- in Shaw and so put aside their ideological differences to fight alongside each other.<br/><br/>It isn't as simple as a union of conveniences- Charles and Erik fast become firm friends, and they band together to start a school for mutants. Among those recruited are the brainbox and soon-to-be-Beast Hank McCoy (Nicholas Hoult), the sonic-screamer and soon-to-be-Banshee Sean Cassidy (Caleb Landry Jones), the plasma-blasting and soon-to-be- Havok Alex Summers (Lucas Till), as well as the winged Angel Salvatore (Zoe Kravitz). Shaw also has his own army- icy Emma Frost (January Jones), teleporter Azaael (Jason Flemyng) and the tornado-spinning Riptide (Alex Gonzalez).<br/><br/>There certainly isn't enough time to give each of the multitude of characters a back-story, but at least Vaughn sets aside space within the spectacular action-packed climax for each of them to show off their unique superpowers. Rather, Vaughn and his frequent collaborator Jane Goldman (working off a story by Sheldon Turner and Bryan Singer) give weight instead to the central relationship between Charles and Erik, emphasising on the bond between the two close friends and their eventual descent into bitter enemies as Professor X and Magneto.<br/><br/>It is in the intimate character drama between Charles and Erik where the movie achieves its greatest payoff. Some of the best lines in the script are reserved for the witty interplay between the two characters, and are especially thought-provoking in their arguments for and against war and diplomacy. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender also share great bromantic chemistry with each other, and their excellent performances- one the dashing yet dangerous individual, and the other the charming and intelligent fellow- allow the friendship between their characters to be the rightful emotional heart of the film.<br/><br/>But to bring home the raison d'être for their disagreement is the budding relationship between Hank (aka Beast) and shape-shifting and future-Mystique Raven (Jennifer Lawrence). Their constant struggle to accept their extraordinary looks (Raven's blue form and Hank's hands- for-feet) or correct their perceived abnormalities so as to better fit into society crystallise the very humanistic message of the X Men series- that of embracing those who may be different from us, but who have every right as us to belong in our society.<br/><br/>Hoult and Lawrence are also outstanding in their own right, and the movie benefits tremendously from strong performances all around. Kevin Bacon is all smarmy menace as Shaw, while Rose Bryne brings a welcome touch of humanism as the rare human in the film to accept these extraordinaires. Veteran character players James Remar, Michael Ironside and Ray Wise add a touch of class to the proceedings, while fanboys will delight over a killer cameo in the movie. <br/><br/>The person who deserves credit for pulling it all together is Vaughn, who so deftly mixes fact and fiction to create an awfully plausible version of alternate reality. Ingenious was the move to situate the might-vs-right dynamic between Charles and Erik against the backdrop of the Cold War, the events of history providing both significance and gravitas, and Vaughn stages the events with terrific pacing and much aplomb. <br/><br/>With ""X Men: First Class"", Vaughn has breathed new life into a franchise that ran aground with its bland and formulaic ""Last Stand"" and an otherwise unremarkable ""Wolverine"" spin off. Admittedly, the storytelling could have been smoother, but Vaughn's reimagining of the X Men universe is more than robust, especially with an intelligent tightly-plotted script, outstanding lead performances and thrilling action sequences. It may not match the brilliance of Bryan Singer's first two films, but this is perhaps as close as it gets."

When pictures were being released I laughed at them with my friend. Beast looked weird and everything looked cheap. I went to the theater thinking, ""I don't know why I'm seeing this it's gonna be stupid.""<br/><br/>What they made was so much more than a prequel. A lot of the times when these movies are made there only function is to explain why everything you already know came to be. This actually had a story to tell. And was the beginning of a great franchise. Casting was good. Even their self referential jokes were good.<br/><br/>I don't know if Bret Ratner hated X-Men and was deliberately trying to ruin it but he did. Goddamn he did... So much that not only was the past the only place to go by the fact that they used time travel to correct this later on.<br/><br/>They made the characters real, who we know but different. They aren't set in their ways yet. Magneto has his evil foundation but he's not there yet. Xavier isn't the teacher but it does come naturally to him. It's fun to see them young doing what kids do.<br/><br/>The story is exciting and worth telling. A lot of really cool things happen. The 60s feel it's nice too.<br/><br/>Little did we know then they this was the start of saving X-Men."

","Am i the only one who thought this movie was bad and i mean REALLY BAD? Im not the best writer but i just cant resist writing something about this movie.<br/><br/>X-Men Origins Wolverine was one of the most disappointing movies I've ever seen, and i honestly thought that this one was worse! and in my book thats saying a lot!<br/><br/>I mean THIS WAS IT!!! This was the big prequel story that started the rivalry between Professor X and Magneto and THIS was the only history they had of being friends!?!? Thats it????? Was THIS the origin story that jump started the war between humans and mutants? Are you serious??<br/><br/>Mystique and Professor X are step brother and sister now!?................REALLY????? He tells her she will never have to feel hunger again and gives her a roof over her head and all that when they are still kids, plus they seem to get a long pretty damn good growing up, not arguing or fighting or anything like that (well maybe a little but definitely nothing serious) and then she betrays him that easily!!!! right after he JUST got shot in the spine!!!!!!!!!..............REALLY!!! You don't need to be a bad guy just to be yourself!! Was that the only motivation for Mystique to betray her brother and join Magneto to later become the evil blue bitch that we all know? And if i remember this correctly, wasn't Professor X walking in the beginning of (X men 3 The last Stand) when he and Magneto were visiting Jean Grey when she was still a kid? I believe he was, and he was a lot older then and already completely bald. Come to think of it! Professor X and Magneto were still friends at that age! which makes not knowing their history about their friendship even more enteresting because you can assume that they were friends for a loooong time! And you can only guess whatever could have happened to make them arch enemies of each other.....<br/><br/>Do you mean to tell me that Professor X can use Cerebro to track down any mutant on the planet and those were the ones they picked to recruit!!! A stupid butterfly girl, an annoying useless screaming kid, a worthless black guy who adapts to the situation for survival and then dies that easily! Havok or whatever with his stupid laser chest, ARE YOU KIDDING ME!? Then to top it off we have Butterfly girl chasing Screaming kid spitting on him and that was supposed to be exciting!? that is what they call action!?!? Is that one of the dumb action scenes that I read about that other people are so damn excited over!? That actually entertained you people..............?<br/><br/>The special effects in this movie looked like they came straight out of a movie that was made in the 90's. I witnessed some of the worst cgi ever viewing this movie! Every scene that contained cgi actually looked like cgi! Very ugly cgi! For example when Magneto stops the missiles shot at the beach and their just hovering in the air or the entire scene of butterfly girl chasing screaming guy, mystique her transformations looked better in the original X men trilogy, even the big radar a couple of miles away that Magneto uses his powers on to make it move looks fake. THIS IS 2011!!! I believe it has to be possible to make cgi effect that the audience obviously KNOWS about it BEING CGI but actually CANT TELL its cgi, am i right?<br/><br/>The more i think about this movie the more flaws come to mind and if i have to write all of them down its gonna take all night!<br/><br/>There has to be someone out there who agrees with me and who will put the flaws he noticed in a review or something.<br/><br/>Sorry for any misspells, I'm Dutch and my English is far from a hundred percent."
"lao4950000","10","15","22","19 June 2011"," This latest X-Men film is first class indeed! Superb acting by the new cast.
","This latest film to join the X-Men franchise injects new life and vigor into the saga. It is as much of a prequel as it is a reboot. From a strictly time-line point-of-view it is a prequel, being set in the early 1960s during the Cuban Missile Crisis. But from a storyline point-of-view, it is very much a reboot, with a whole new younger cast along with whole new interesting stories and relationships to involve them in.<br/><br/>The film goes all the way back to the beginning in 1944, in Nazi occupied Poland. Here, we are introduced to young Erik Lensherr. Erik is forced to watch his mother be shot right in front of him by Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon). The uncontrollable rage Erik then feels unleashes his powers and he then goes on to trash every metal object in the room. However, he is unable to focus and use his powers against Shaw, and so the main plot of the film becomes Erik's quest for vengeance.<br/><br/>In contrast with Erik's tragic childhood, we see the wealthy opulent lifestyle that Charles Xavier enjoyed. In this film, he meets young Mystique, and quickly adopts her as his younger sister.<br/><br/>Cut to 1962 where the rest of the film takes place. Adult Erik, played excellently by Michael Fassbender continues on his quest for revenge against Shaw. In this film, he has not yet become Magneto. He is not the villain, in fact he is a character we all sympathize with. Inside he is still the traumatized boy who watched his mother get killed right in front of him. What I love about X-Men First Class is that it finally adds layers to Magneto's character, he isn't just a one-dimensional cartoon villain.<br/><br/>And James McAvoy breathes new life as young adult Charles. Here, the young Professor X is a dashing English gentleman who uses witty pick-up lines on pretty college girls and chugs whole pints of beer. His expertise on mutations is what leads to his recruitment to the CIA by Moira MacTaggert (Rose Byrne). And it is through the CIA that brings Charles and Erik's paths together.<br/><br/>McAvoy and Fassbender have amazing on screen chemistry together, and this is clearly reflected in Charles and Erik's fast developing friendship. These two men are not just friends, they really see themselves as brothers. The casting for both Charles and Erik could not have been more perfect, you can definitely see how even decades later Professor X and Magneto stay lifelong friends even if they have opposite philosophies.<br/><br/>The other relationship that must be mentioned is the romance between young Beast (Nicholas Hoult) and young Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence). Their short-lived relationship is tragic yet poignant. It falls victim to self-hatred and the struggle for acceptance in a human society that all too often shows absolute cruelty to those who are different...........that is the key message of the X-Men and it is so beautifully played out by these two doomed lovebirds.<br/><br/>From watching this film, you actually want Erik and Charles to continue being best friends without any of the tragedy and mutant-against-mutant fighting. But alas, we all know how it all ends, so the ending of film can't show anything different. You finally see how Charles becomes paralyzed, the whole lead-up to that scene is just epically sad yet beautiful at the same time.<br/><br/>This was a wonderfully acted project and it also contains just the right amount of action scenes that we all love and demand from an X-Men film. I encourage you all to see it if you haven't already."

","The biggest problem of these prequels is it's kind of messy to the original X-Men movies. Well, the filmmakers said this is a reboot but there are some references to the original X-Men series. Anyways, ""X-Men: First Class"" is fun and had a lot of great action. It's the biggest X-Men movie ever made and it's better than the last two X-Men movies.<br/><br/>The filmmakers stated that this movie is a reboot but things from the old X-Men movies had an appearance to this movie. The problem of giving reference from the old X-Men movies to this reboot is it doesn't make this movie stand alone. Maybe the references only made for the laughs but if this is a prequel then it'll be a total mess.<br/><br/>The best parts goes to the action(obviously). Matthew Vaughn knows how to make big and awesome action scenes. The best parts also goes to the scenes of Michael Fassbender. He really steals the show. He made Erik/Magneto more dangerous than ever. It's fun and intense to see him do something menacing. The rest of the cast is also pretty good. James McAvoy gave a lot of heart to his role. Him and Fassbender had good chemistry.<br/><br/>Overall, ""X-Men First Class"" is good especially if you are looking for large scale action. I guess large scale is one thing that's missing to the first four X-Men films. X3 had a large scale action that left us hanging in the end. This one has the action finale that is intense and really big. Maybe the reference of the old X-Men movies is only made for the laughs. By the way this is Matthew Vaughn's thing. There's action plus comedy."
"James_Dickson","4","62","111","12 June 2011"," X-Men: Economy Class
","I'm prepared to forgive the film its poorly explained, misconstrued, evolutionary science, as it is a comic book adaptation after all, but that should not excuse the ponderous emptiness of the story, which detracts significantly from the promising beginnings established in the first film(s). Bereft of compelling character development, sinister undertones and brooding tension, the 'climax' of betrayal and inevitable, prophetic fulfilment were so poorly managed I was left feeling ambivalent and detached; while the rest of the film, with its cheesy 'nudge-wink' humour and clumsy, explanatory dialogue left me head in hands, knuckle-biting, inwardly-sighing and fidgeting with disappointment throughout.<br/><br/>I got the impression Matthew Vaughn wanted us to laugh AT the film, with a number of moments where this was seemingly encouraged (Wolverine's cameo, the bedroom scenes, Beasts appearance etc). Was he in fact being a lazy snob toward X-Men just because he had his own little adaptation in Kick-Ass? I had a bad feeling when I discovered Bryan Singer wasn't directing the third film, but little did I realise that X-Men: The Last Stand would actually look good in comparison to First Class. I now await any Kick-Ass sequel/spin-off with unexpected trepidation as I have no idea what Matthew Vaughn was trying here and I was amazed to discover Bryan Singer was actually involved in the creation of this messy film, which ended up being too much of not a lot.<br/><br/>All said and done, Fassbender and McAvoy put in decent performances, although Kevin Bacon as the central antagonist was truly underwhelming and un-menacing and if this is the best he's got to offer then he should go back to doing inconsequential cameo's in films like Planes, Trains and Automobiles, or make a prequel of tremors, or just give up. Any of which I would be happy with."
"Vinegaroon3","2","101","189","13 June 2011"," Silly, cheesy, contrived, bomb.
","Once again, I was prompted into seeing this movie because of extremely high IMDb reviews.<br/><br/>I could not disagree more with those who are rating this movie highly. Frankly, I thought it was terrible.<br/><br/>Where to begin....<br/><br/>I understand a movie dealing with a subject like X-Men requires a large suspension of disbelief. I was actually a fan of the first X-Men movie, but this latest incarnation was bad in so many ways I am not sure I am a sufficiently proficient writer to articulate them....<br/><br/>It was cheesy, silly, contrived, largely poorly acted, and simply ridiculous. The plot and antagonist reminded of the worst of the ""James Bond"" franchise, with the villain traveling around in a luxurious submarine with an attractive woman (who could turn herself into a diamond....riiiiight) hanging on his arm. He is going to destroy the world, of course, and smile and laugh while doing it so we will know he is really bad. Lame.<br/><br/>Despite spending a lot of time examining the history of the major characters, the film has almost zero effective character development. There is a ""Tinkerbell"" like character who flies around on dragonfly wings and spits fireballs. She of course is knock-out gorgeous, and is discovered while working as a stripper. Yes, I am capable of ""suspending disbelief"", but there was no point here. This was simply painfully stupid.<br/><br/>I know nothing of the X-Men comics, but I think the idea is mildly interesting as long as it is kept within limits. They managed to do this with the first movie. However, since the first installment they have become less and less focused on story and character development, and more and more based on ridiculous spectacle.<br/><br/>In the larger picture, I am simply going to have to stop paying attention to the ""Best"" ratings that show up first on IMDb when a new film is released. I have wasted too much money seeing highly rated films, like this one, that are simply terrible. I am convinced these reviews are not genuine and are quickly posted when poor films are released in an attempt to salvage some commercial success.<br/><br/>I sincerely hope this review will save some of you from making my mistake. This latest X-Men film is awful. Hopefully this review will be visible among the dishonest hype, and save some of you from wasting your time and money."
"timbob82","1","120","228","7 June 2011"," Truly terrible film benefiting from its own hype
","Rarely have I seen a film professing to be good that ended up being as bad as XMFC. <br/><br/>The back story altogether was silly and not just written to be taking place in the 60s, but seemed to be written as if the writers were living in the 60s. There was soooo much cheesy and corny crap. The yacht that turns into a submarine, the overly trusting CIA that takes super-powered people and lets them run wild recruiting kids to be super-secret agents for the government (what is this, Spy Kids?), the bad guy with the secret passageways behind the bookshelf and the table that spins around when you touch the secret panel...I mean all of that late 60s/early 70s James Bond flotsam that no one ever really did or had, but was all part of the ""isn't this cool, daddio"" culture of the time and so popped up in every action movie. I was waiting for there to be a mad scientist with a death-ray on the moon. So much for Vaughn's determination to bring these characters into a realistic setting. <br/><br/>Then, the most interesting characters were the ones most under-utilized. Havok, Banshee, Darwin, Azazel and Riptide were completely glossed over in favor of the already over-exposed characters. People complain about the X-films over using Wolverine and that they are tired of it? Well, absent him, who are the two characters most heavily utilized in the X-films? Magneto (the ever-villain, whose constant inclusion negates the use of far more interesting villains) and Xavier. The other two character focal points, Mystique and Beast, have also been done. So anyone hoping for some good character exposition on the new blood...sorry, you are S.O.L. Nothing here but the same old, same old. But then, on the topic of the characters who actually did get exposition... --Magneto. You get his initial entrance into the concentration camp, and then he is 30. 12 to 30...just like that. What happened in between? What happened between when he got liberated and the first scene with him in the hotel room spinning the coin round his fingers? It was bad story telling. They wanted him to be completely unencumbered with a job, friends, a home...anything that would ground his character in reality. They wanted him to be a clean slate of a character with one thing only: revenge on Shaw. Talk about a one-dimensional character. Plus, his turn-coat to being a bad guy was practically instantaneous. Yeah, he and Xavier had that very brief convo about mutants/humans sitting across the chess board, but that was really it. Then, a few meglo-maniacal words from Shaw in the reactor room and Magneto is ready to turn coat on the only people in his entire life that he has ever been able to call friend. Almost as silly as Darth Vader's turn in Episode III. <br/><br/>--Mystique...same exact problem. Her brother, best friend, only person in the world she really cares about. Not only does she betray his dream, not only does she go against every other one of her friends, but she up and leaves Xavier shot and possibly dying. I'd be one thing if she were a stalwart ""mutant and proud"" booster from the start, but she has only ever wanted to be normal and has known love, friendship and acceptance and she immediately turns away from her entire life and the beliefs she has had her whole life after a few kind words from a guy she threw herself at (who ultimately rejected her advances, btw). Her turn was sillier than Magneto's. At least he had the bad childhood to fall back on. <br/><br/>--Shaw. His motivation was wholly unbelievable. He was a completely one-dimensional villain. Why exactly did he want to do what he was planning? Here he is, a wealthy and powerful man who has never known anti-mutant prejudice due to his ability to pass for a human, as well as the fact that there was no anti-mutant prejudice at this time since mutants were an, as yet, undiscovered species. And yet, he is looking to destroy all of humanity. Oh yeah, and exactly how were the mutants to survive the nuclear holocaust? I don't recall anyone claiming all mutants were immune to radiation poisoning. So he was just a cartoonish Bond villain with no reasoning behind his motivation. <br/><br/>So characters were bad, style and execution of the plot was bad, action and FX were Michael Bay-esque in that it was random explosions and jump cuts that had too many things happening too fast to make an impact. Clichéd training montages. Terrible effects on Beast. Silly one-dimensional human characters. Some of the acting was passable, but some was flat out bad (January Jones, the Kravitz girl) and the ones that were good were really just OK. No stand out performances. And even if Fassbender and Macavoy could be seen as great, they weren't so good that the entire movie can hang on their performances. <br/><br/>Frankly, I think this film is a beneficiary of its own hype. Maybe a lot of critics who grew up in the 60s/70s were swept up in the nostalgia for their lost childhood and looked fondly on this film because of it. High critical praise and constant...never...ending...PROMOTION for weeks had people hypnotized into thinking this movie's release was going to be the event of all events. I think it got to a point where the people who were moderately excited about its release started hyping themselves up more and more at every positive review and every new trailer. Every new viral character spotlight and every crossover (come on...a Statefarm Insurance crossover?!?). Eventually, they just told themselves that this was the movie of the year and, for those people, it became a self-fulfilling prophecy. <br/><br/>I'd recommend passing on this one. Hopefully, they will reboot the whole series and make an X-Men movie that does the characters justice."
"Kia00","Null","47","83","29 May 2011"," Hugely Entertaining. Delivers in Every Way!
","An outstanding effort, what a superb early summer this has been! The characters, effects, and story were all beyond great. Bryan Singer is back and it clearly showed. Add director Vaughn's touch and both display an amazing vision. They manage to keep the story intense and flowing but filled with depth and heart. They also kept an eye on what has come before without being burdened or overly tied to it. If you've never seen any x-film, you'll still love this movie. That said, it builds for another installment and I absolutely can't wait to see it and to see where we go next. The Singer and Vaughn team also manages to deliver a little bit of everything, and I mean EVERYTHING. There's intrigue, romance, conspiracy, drama, conflict, historical context, retro flavor, fun, humor and of course, kick butt comic book style slugfests. <br/><br/>I think this is now the best comic book movie summer ever (even though it's not even officially summer yet) and I'm not exaggerating. 2008 was great but I think we have a new king. Thor was pure greatness and Captain America looks superb. This was the only question mark from Marvel's stable and they absolutely hit it out of the park. Erik and Charles are now given room to thrive and breathe, find their own voice and their own distinctiveness. The plot becomes more intricate as the situations become more dire. Not many adaptations have ever dug as deep as First Class. These are truly some of the most complex characters I've ever seen in a super hero based movie. They're a group of characters who are so well written and full of small, personal moments that they match the best of their rich, four-color origins. They become living, breathing people whom have pasts, presents and futures and I can't wait to see where this new cast takes us from this point forward.<br/><br/>I love this younger Xavier and the fact that his youthful flaws are fully on display. Charles is caught up in himself as most people are in their youth. He is proud and confident young man, and he's certainly not the selfless person that we saw in the X-Men trilogy. I love the fact that the writers were smart enough to convey these elements and show a young man in need of growth. They easily could've made him a ""mini me"" version of Patrick Stewart's Xavier. Instead they went much deeper and the result is much more interesting. Charles' relationship with Raven/Mystique is fascinating especially when you compare both character to what they will become later. She's an assistant to him and he cares for her, but his ego causes unintended consequences. At times, Charles gives off a condescending, big-brother attitude and that fits so well to the growth the character needs to undertake. You see it in the way he treats the others. In the trilogy, he's exorcised that from his personality. Here, his ego is on a par with Magneto and that makes for an interesting dynamic. <br/><br/>Overall, just like X2, I had a great time and thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this movie."

"tyreeewebster","9","11","16","25 June 2011"," X Men: First Class!
","Out of all of Marvel Studios' films, the 'X- MEN' franchise is one of my favourites. This is because of the great special effects, explosive action scenes, hot babes and the frequent comedic moments. When I heard that a prequel to the series was going to be made, my brother and I were really excited because we knew that it was going to be super AWESOME! And it was. But let's face it, the movie did have it's flaws, it being the lame writing or the not- as good as X Men 3- special effects, even my favourite mutant, BEAST had his flaws, but I'll get to him later.<br/><br/>PROS: The great parts about this movie was the near- perfect casting. James McCavoy is great as always as the awesome Professor X, as he showed us a side of the character we have never seen before! He was charming, cool and very courageous! Michael Fassbender was also good as Erik Lensherr (MAGNETO) and we also get to see how he became the menacing Magneto in the later movies. It's just his accent that jerked me off. Other than that, he did a good job. Other actors that were good were January Jones as EMMA FROST and Kevin Bacon as SEBASTIAN SHAW, he was a cool, likable yet believable villain. The writing was great, I loved the idea of including the clip about young MAGNETO from 'X MEN' in the beginning of the movie. The direction was very awesome, with the director being Matthew Vaughn.<br/><br/>CONS: I'm going to keep this part as short as possible because I don't want you to be turned off by the negative aspects and focus more on the positive. I guess my biggest flaw for this film, in my opinion, is the video game-like special effects. I don't know what it is, it's just that it didn't look as cool as the previous films, it was just too noticeable that it was CGI. Like I said at the beginning, the dialogue was a bit crappy, for example, at the end of the movie when MAGNETO is called by his real name and says 'Actually, I prefer... Magneto!', which my friend then turned to 'Actually, I prefer... Potato!' The make-up for BEAST kind of sucked, but it was still very well done.<br/><br/>Overall, this isn't a bad movie, it's a good movie! It's a fun Blockbuster Summer action film to enjoy with your friends, so if you're walking into the cinema, hoping to see something like 'THE KING'S SPEECH'. Then you'll be disappointed. But see it anyway... it's the X MEN! <br/><br/>See the movie! 9/10"
"jonnyhavey","9","11","16","18 June 2011"," ""Fluid Pace: Classy and Stylish Prequel""
","Director Matthew Vaughn is back for a more conventional super hero movie after wowing audiences with last year's ""Kick Ass."" He has redefined the ""X-Men"" series with a very stylish work of cinema as attempt two at creating a prequel is successful with ""X-Men: First Class."" Like ""Origins"" there are a plethora of characters that the audience has to worry about, however, with the smart use of time and space Vaughn develops the roots of various mutants with a fluid pace. James McAvoy (""Wanted"", ""The Conspirator"") and Michael Fassbender (""Inglourious Bastards"",""300"") set up the best on screen matchup of the year with their respective portrayals of Charles Xavier (Professor X) and Erik Lehnsherr (Magneto). The film commences as Erik is separated from his mother and killed by a man named Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon, ""Frost/Nixon""). This is followed by background of a young Charles as he befriends a very familiar character, Raven aka Mystic (Academy Award Nominee Jennifer Lawrence, ""Winter's Bone""). After this brief exposition, the audience is taken on a nonstop thrill ride as the mutants influence the Cold War. Erik embarks on a path of vengeance to kill Shaw. Since their last encounter Shaw has started his own mutant army and has a very dangerous right-hand woman, Emma Frost (January Jones, ""Mad Men""). Meanwhile, Charles and Raven are tracked down by a woman named Moira MacTaggert (Rose Byrne, ""Bridesmaids"") for their mutant expertise. Everything is connected in one way or another as the 1960s setting makes the film a cool cinematic rebirth to a new ""X-Men Trilogy.""<br/><br/>The Good: Director Vaughn reinvents the film series with a very well written script and a dark old school spectacle. Combining the classic feel of the 1960s and the Marvel comic book guise with McAvoy's ingenious, sexy interpretation of Professor X and Fassbender's rugged vindictive portrayal of Magneto makes this the best superhero film of the year. The casting of two big name congenial actors as antagonists (Bacon and Jones) along with giving their motive multiple purposes is smart cinema. Cinematography finishes it all off with a mixture of ""Mad Men"" flare in a comic strip.<br/><br/>The character development of Angel Salvadore (Zoe Kravitz, ""It's Kind of a Funny Story"") is very irritating, failing to produce a motive for her later actions. This can be attributed to the fact that even though Vaughn does a good job juggling the plethora of characters, it is inevitable that one falls through the cracks. Also, the fast pace of the film foreshadows a climatic ending which in actuality fails to impress after the interminable build up.<br/><br/>Vaughn is following in Christopher Nolan's footsteps as he transforms his second superhero comic into motion picture form. He uses more of a comic book approach than Nolan casting to perfection and creating one of the best prequels to ever be made."
"edmondoster","1","83","160","10 June 2011"," Magneto's PRAISE SONG to hatred. Worst X-Men movie to-date.
","This movie should had been named: ""MAGNETO"" or better; ""Magneto's love story with hate"".<br/><br/>ALL the previous Xmen films bespoke of friendship, camaraderie and humanity and the best positive traits associated with these basic qualities and these films contained the positive traits which define the Xmen... and what makes them attractive & engaging... for me at-least. ""First Class"" seriously lacks these good qualities. And it replaces all that was good, moral or engaging with the Xmen franchise with only one thing; Magneto's hate. Almost all characters in the movie, including the amazing, great character of Prof. Charles Xavier is, at the hands of the ""hooh-haah"" director Matthew Vaughn, reduced to ""second class"" citizens (yes, definitely, pun-intended) in order to allow the glorification of Magneto's HATE. <br/><br/>The ""chutzpah"" is in that the director does it, in plain sight, all the while asking us-- to applaud Magneto and to create in us, fans and viewers, a sense of wonder and awe about how ""cool"" Magneto's awful and cruel shenanigans throughout the movie, are. <br/><br/>Why is Magneto shown off in this movie as ""the underdog hero""? And why is this done, while trampling on other and better characters of the Xmen franchise? Why is Prof. Xavier reduced, in the hands of Vaughn, to a mere sidekick and 2'nd grade character, whose only existence, according to Vaughn's movie, is to showcase and highlight how 'cool' and defiant Magneto's bottom-line cruelty, is-- in almost every single scene in which Prof.X and Magneto appear together?? <br/><br/>I'm sure there are more knowledgeable and ""professional"" Xmen fans than me, out there, in the world. However, some things are very clear. No matter how good you're familiar with the Xmen or how many fan-stripes you have on your badges. Magneto is NOT the 'good'-cool-wow protagonist. He simply is NOT that. Prof. Xavier is NOT Magneto's sidekick-glorifier, whose sole purpose is to show how ""cool"" we should perceive (by Vaughn) Magneto as. Prof. X is so much... so much more than that.<br/><br/>And what's with Mystique? Why's she's Prof. X's girlfriend at first, and then she goes... how weird and ugly is that? What's that supposed to mean... I mean except that she's a... -- well, of a truly questionable character, you know?<br/><br/>Yes, I know what Vaughn is trying to get us convinced in; Magneto had ""that"" childhood, in the Shoah... Really? We knew that from the first shot in Singer's ""Xmen"". Does that condone the terrible things Lensher/Magneto does 'because' of it? Ask Vaughn; he knows. Vaughn says a big ""yes"". Oh... I guess that having that Shoah childhood allows Lensher to do EVERYTHING now, in the name of revenge. <br/><br/>In Singer's ""Xmen"" (2000), Singer trusts our judgment, to decide; whether we choose to view Magneto as a 'good guy'/'bad guy'. Vaughn doesn't ""trouble"" us with that issue; Vaughn is after ""cool""... that's what he cares about. <br/><br/>For Vaughn, the issue Good versus evil turns to a 'second class citizen' (pun intended, again) when 'the COOL factor' enters the game. Vaughn is so eager to present Magneto as ""cool"" and as poised as James Bond or Bruce Wayne, that he simply throws the fact that this character is utterly cruel & immoral, right out the window. Why not? The applaud sign goes up after showing yet another of Magneto's beastiality.<br/><br/>I read a reviewer saying that this new movie doesn't need Wolverine. Why? Because, according to this big-shot reviewer, Magneto 'more than makes up' for Wolverine's absence... Really?? At the ending of 2000's ""Xmen"", Wolverine sacrifices his life, knowingly and intentionally, in order to save Rogue's life. That's what makes Wolverine--- Wolverine. That's what makes him a hero, in my book. Yes, it's cool; those adamantium claws, that no-hold bars attitude...But these do not a HERO make. What Wolverine does for Rogue to live, at the end of 2000's Xmen, at the expense of his own life... that's what a hero make. <br/><br/>Contrastingly, consider what Lensher/Magneto does 'for' his mutant comrades/friends in the end of ""Xmen:FC""... -- Lensher disposes of his enemies (or more correctly; rivals) in a way that would Nazi sympathizers proud. --- He is responsible, even if in-directly, for the permanent maiming and crippling of the only man (Prof. X) who ever chose to try to persuade him to see beyond his selfish hate. --- He steals that's man sister/girlfriend (who was selfish throughout anyway... no big loss, but still), and eventually leaves that person abandoned, badly hurt and crippled permanently while he still goes out to pursue his still unsatisfied selfish goals for domination over those who 'don't see his way'. With friends like Lensher, who even needs enemies? Ask Prof. X. He learnt that the hard way. <br/><br/>Vaughn is so taken by admiration to Magneto, trying to pitch him off and out as no-less than the ""new James Bond""... that he (Vaughn) even gives Magneto a ""Bond. James Bond"" kind of line in the ending of the film... which is not only plain ugly... but also very condescending.<br/><br/>Problem is: X-MEN was never, at it's very core and it's most fundamental message-- a one-man show (like Bond or 'solo' superheroes)!!! X-men was, forever, a 'team-effort' showcasing & celebrating the need to band together and be AS A TEAM one for the other. X-men in many of it's incarnations, celebrated unity and celebrated TRUE friendship & camaraderie. That is... until ""hooh-haah"" director Matthew Vaughn came along with ""First Class"" and stripped the Xmen of their most valuable and True badge of Honor. <br/><br/>And Vaughn replaced that Xmen badge of Honor and all it stood for- - for one thing alone: Magneto's praise song, sung by Magneto (and Vaughn), applauding and celebrating hatred. <br/><br/>By going against everything the Xmen ever stood for... this movie becomes the worst X-men movie to-date and a major disappointment."
"chico-ortiz","1","116","232","13 June 2011"," amazed at so many positive reviews...
","Don't know where to begin, this was such a bad, cheesy, lame film! - and I'm an X-Men fan. The previous 3 seemed to have some intelligence, but this seems like it was made by some dumb-ass kid. I can't believe how many good reviews this has when almost everything about it was so poor.<br/><br/>The acting: overwrought and embarrassing (especially January Jones who was like a Playboy bunny just learning to act).<br/><br/>The characters: Prof. X - why the hell is he English all of a sudden? - was like a creepy, cheesy, horny David Cameron (which can never be appealing). Nothing like his character in the comics or other films - just bad and embarrassing. Magneto's accent came and went as it pleased (and I'm not even sure if it was ever supposed to be there, or what it was supposed to be), and he was as interesting as a piece of wood. Banshee was American, not Irish; Moira McTaggart was American, not Scottish. Unrealistic motivations and actions abound. The Beast's costume looked like Wolverine has rolled around in some blue fur and glue. Otherwise, it's a like a catwalk of one beautiful, posturing teen after another: every person, every random mutant, had to be young, beautiful, ripped, sexy - even if they were previously cab drivers or whatever. Totally unrealistic and all about image consciousness (ironic for the heavy-handed message about Mystique accepting herself).<br/><br/>The structure: a lot of running around aimlessly, with one anti-climax after another.<br/><br/>The setting: supposed to be early, pre-hippy 60s, but often came off like mid-late 60s, as if the set/costume/music people were a bunch of ignorami who just thought 'cool- 60s, mod, James Bond, shagadelic'. Really, really lame.<br/><br/>The sexism: women are mainly there for eye candy, and to be models of insecurity, and any excuse to show them in lingerie, in strip clubs, T&A close-ups etc. is greedily taken. Emma Frost is instructed by Magneto to go get her some ice, and she does so like an obedient servant. Angel and her fellow prostitutes are all beautiful, happy and fit, willing servants for the pleasures of men - not depressed, shaking, acne-scarred women debasing themselves to feed their families or their habits. Really irresponsible film-making - and before anyone says ""lighten up, it's just a movie"", remember that the comics were really good - and realistic - about social issues (despite the women's skimpy costumes!).<br/><br/>The racism: I can't believe reviewers haven't mentioned this - in a scene where Kevin Bacon says to Darwin (who is black), ""So you have two choices, you can do nothing with your powers and be enslaved..."" and at the word 'enslaved' the camera does a close-up on Darwin for a long few seconds... reinforcing the equation of black man = slave. Maybe the heavy-handed director was trying to suggest that Darwin would naturally relate to Bacon's speech given his race's history... but a few minutes later he's killed! - the old movie cliché' that the black man is always the first to die, once again! Truly an appalling piece of film-making, and not worth the half-price tickets I paid for."
"aaronjbong","10","43","79","24 June 2011"," An Excellent Prequel With a Compelling Storyline and Exciting Action Sequences; First-Class Entertainment
","""X-Men: First Class"" is an excellent prequel to the original ""X-Men"" trilogy. It has a compelling storyline chronicling the adventures of Professor X and Magneto, or should I say, Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr before they became enemies, as depicted in the three movies that form the original ""X-Men"" trilogy. Not only a compelling storyline, but ""First Class"" also promises amazing sequences of intense action. <br/><br/>""First Class"" chronicles the adventures of Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr before they became enemies. Set in 1962 during the Cuban Missile Crisis, the two met during a mission in which Xavier and the CIAs are trying to track down a guy named Sebastian Shaw, who apparently is a mutant and acts as a threat to the world. In that time, Xavier found Lensherr trying to stop Shaw from getting away using his mutant powers and told him to let it go as continuing to do so will result in the drowning of Lensherr and Xavier. Later, Lensherr and Xavier become allies and learn of Shaw's intentions of starting World War 3 that would bring mutants into rulers of the world with most of the world in turmoil. Xavier and Lensherr then decide to recruit other mutants and create a mini mutant army to stop Shaw from igniting the start of World War 3. Apart from stopping Shaw, ""First Class"" also tells the story of how Xavier and Lensherr became enemies and split the first generation of X-Men. <br/><br/>""First Class"" is truly a fantastic prequel to the popular ""X-Men"" series. With a compelling storyline, it has action-packed sequences that would keep audiences hooked until the end. The action sequences are much more exciting than that of ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"". The fighting scenes were very entertaining and should be enjoyed by audiences. <br/><br/>Besides the action sequences, the script, and the special effects of the film were excellent. The script had no awkward lines and the special effects of the film were real and life-like. The acting was also great and there was no problem with it. Well done!<br/><br/>Humor also plays a role in this film. In serious moments, sometimes to cheer the audiences up, humor is added. The jokes and humor in the movie was pretty funny. <br/><br/>Overall, ""First Class"" is a mesmerizing mixture of a compelling storyline, action-packed sequences, amazing special effects, and funny jokes. Matthew Vaughn has crafted a fantastic prequel that serves as a pleasant addition to the ""X-Men"" series (although ""Wolverine"" was disappointing). This movie has great storytelling and awesome sequences of intense action. <br/><br/>In terms of recommendation, ""First Class"" is a must-watch summer movie that should be on your list of must-see summer blockbusters of 2011. The compelling storyline will keep audiences interested, the fighting scenes should keep audiences excited, and the special effects should make audiences satisfied with the film. Anyone disappointed with the last ""X- Men"" movie, ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"", should be relieved after watching the new, fresh, and amazing ""X-Men: First Class"". <br/><br/>""X-Men: First Class"" is truly first-class entertainment. <br/><br/>Prince AJB's Rating: 10/10 (Excellent)<br/><br/>Thank you for reading my review on ""X-Men: First Class"". I do hope that this is a useful review for you to read."

","In 1944, in Poland, the boy Erik Lehnsherr unleashes his magnetic power when his mother is sent to a concentration camp. The evil Dr. Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) brings Erik to his office and kills his mother, increasing his abilities through anger. In New York, the wealthy Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) meets the mutant Raven (Jennifer Lawrence) and invites her to live in his manor.<br/><br/>In 1962, the CIA agent Moira MacTaggert (Rose Byrne) discovers the existence of mutants working with Shaw and the invites Professor Xavier to recruit mutants to work for the USA government. Xavier teams up with Raven, Erik and a group of young mutants. Sooner they learn that the evil Shaw has the intention of beginning a nuclear war to destroy the world and increase his power. <br/><br/>""X-Men: First Class"" is an entertaining film for fans of action films with superheroes that discloses the beginning of the saga of the mutants. The plot has many flaws, like for example: why Erik destroys Dr. Shaw's office, kills the guards but does not destroy the killer Shaw? How Xavier and Raven become best friends after a five- minute dialog? Why the lack of gratitude of Raven after the accident with Xavier in the end? The power of Azazel is so exaggerated that becomes impossible to be defeated.<br/><br/>Kevin Bacon is a great villain and the insertion in the context of the Cold War and using the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 as background is a funny joke. My vote is seven.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""X-Men: Primeira Classe"" (""X-Men: First Class"")"
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","12","19","9 June 2011"," The origin story that the ""X-Men"" universe deserves
","Superhero movies have been thriving in both Hollywood and public consciousness for almost 10 years now, and one of the biggest reasons has been the origin story. ""Spider-Man"" in 2002 revealed how the emotional power of a superhero's motivation can humanize even those characters with the most extraordinary powers. ""X-Men: First Class"" provides this oh so necessary background to a franchise whose last two film entries sacrificed depth of character for mutant and superpower pageantry. Wolverine might be the most popular character from the ""X-Men"" world, but the story of how Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr developed two different ideologies and became Professor X and Magneto encapsulates the comics' core. ""First Class"" recognizes this all the way.<br/><br/>When the action-packed but unmoving ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" was announced, it came coupled with the hiring of a writer for ""X-Men Origins: Magneto."" ""First Class"" essentially gives us that story. This is a film about Erik's decision to become Magneto and Michael Fassbender revels in the spotlight as the powerful metal-bender who eventually leads what becomes the Brotherhood of Mutants. Fassbender will continue to be an acting force to reckon with in the future as he brings incredible depth to a character already written so well.<br/><br/>""X-Men: First Class"" has to be the best-written superhero film since ""The Dark Knight"" and maybe ever behind the first two ""Spider-Man"" films. The script is loaded with thematic insights into the notion of being an outsider — the very notion that's made this comic so universally loved. The fascinating complexity of Magneto and Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) gets abundant attention and even the minor characters exude that feeling of learning to embrace and understand their powers and differences for the first time.<br/><br/>The film opens with a scene directly from the original ""X-Men"": a young Erik at a concentration camp gets separated from his mother and bends a metal gate. A Nazi doctor takes note of this ability and meets with Erik, eventually killing his mother in front of him as to provoke the anger that triggers Erik's powers. That villain happens to be a mutant himself, one who in the '60s becomes known as Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon). Erik's one goal is to avenge that death. This background alone, that of a Holocaust survivor, makes Erik such a challenging character for an audience. In his pursuit of Shaw, Erik meets Charles (James McAvoy), whose own quest to find other mutants with the help of a young CIA agent named Moira McTaggert (Rose Byrne) also has him tracking Shaw. As it happens, Shaw's plan is to incite the Cuban Missile Crisis and start a nuclear war, setting the stage for mutant supremacy.<br/><br/>Ian McKellan and Patrick Stewart are tough shoes to fill, but Fassbender and McAvoy make those characters their own while commanding the screen much like those venerated talents. Despite the film leaning heavily toward Magneto's story, McAvoy impresses here as a rallying leader figure. He has a youthful charisma that a bald wheelchair-bound Professor X never gets the luxury of wielding in the original films, but he demonstrates a maturity we've never gotten to see from McAvoy, who's always playing teenage or 20-something characters thanks to his boyish looks. The chemistry between him and Fassbender echoes that between McKellan and Stewart but in a much different way. With this film now in the ""X-Men"" canon, I think revisiting the original trilogy would actually make the original films' Magneto-Professor X subplots more powerful. That's how well the writing team captures their relationship and story despite the many other things going on.<br/><br/>Director Matthew Vaughn strikes a nice balance between the grittiness of a ""Layer Cake"" and the superhero fun of ""Kick-Ass."" Vaughn milks the most he can out of a PG-13 rating as some gruesome deaths are left to the imagination or shown simply without the blood. Graphic enough or not, ""First Class"" keeps a dark tone with the exception of all the teenage mutants learning to control and showing off their powers. Even then, they remain firmly rooted in the script's core ideas and messages.<br/><br/>""First Class"" forces you to keep track of several mutants, but only a couple feel hollow or ineffective. Despite being a comic book icon, Emma Frost appears to be nothing but a fembot as played by January Jones. A telepath like Professor X but with the ability to turn her skin into diamonds, she serves Shaw with seemingly no regard for her own interests, whatever they may be. Jones provides no edginess to the character, who essentially serves the same purpose as Mystique in the original films as the faithful but alluring evil ""assistant.""<br/><br/>Lawrence as Raven aka Mystique and Nicholas Hoult as Hank aka Beast represent an effective use of subplot. Both play young mutants who possess powers that exhibit physical characteristics. As young people, they wrestle with questions of fitting in or embracing who they are, which echoes the larger Erik/Charles storyline on a smaller scale.<br/><br/>Regardless your thoughts on ""X-Men: First Class"" as a stand-alone film, it unquestionably does great justice to the power of the ""X-Men"" story as a whole and reminds us why this message has universal qualities that all can identify with. Not only are there the questions of conformity, but also of human nature. The climax reminds us of one of the major differences between Charles and Erik: one has faith that humanity will come to accept mutants and the other doesn't. Although we've been trained to agree with Charles since Bryan Singer's first film in 2000, ""First Class"" helps us come to realize the power of Magneto's argument, proving he's not so much a villain, but a character with a darker and perhaps more realistic world view.<br/><br/>The talent runs very deep in this retro-fitted backstory to the ""X-Men"" universe that refocuses the franchise for the better. <br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com"
"porsche-bush","8","7","10","20 June 2011"," Great movie! Great actors! best prequel yet!
","usually I am not a fan of marvel comics, but i made an exception for this one :) If you followed the comic book series, it uses similarities from the comics to the movie. And we also get a cameo appearance from Hugh Jackman(Wolverine). I may have not noticed the infamous stan lee appearance that he always makes in the movies that deal with his comics. But I am sure it was there. I think its a great movie for ages 5 to adult. It has history, very mild violence, some comedy, drama, and romance. All the elements to live up to the X-Men franchise. It is not at all disappointing if you have knowledge of the other movies or the comic book series. That is the only flaw I see. It is definitely a tribute to the fans of X-Men. Personally I am a DC comic books fan, but if you are a comic fan or just a fan of the movie series your in for a treat :) but if you have no knowledge of either of those things you will be disappointed."
"premium90","8","7","10","18 June 2011"," This film is goooooooooood! Watch it.
","I believe most people understand the concept of the x-men by now. If you have seen the previous 3 x-men, you will definitely say this blows them away completely.<br/><br/>I have got to say, I found the previous 3 x-men films really boring. This prequel definitely has the edge and the director got it right! It follows how the x-men started and who these two main characters are.<br/><br/>The female characters are really sexy! Really sexy! I can't believe the cleavage in this film. Where did they find these characters.<br/><br/>This is a definite watchable film.<br/><br/>Anyway, without boring people - please watch it! It is on the same wavelength of batman alike. Very nice and good film at it's best!"
"MarcusJ13","8","7","10","14 June 2011"," Stylish prequel and a welcome addition
","When the words prequel and reboot are mentioned about the same film I get a little sceptical. I loved the X-Men series and so wanted this to be good. Gladly, this was a welcome addition and an example of a prequel that works brilliantly on many levels but also takes a few liberties in some areas. If you are very aware of the past X-Men films there are a few things that differ with the continuity that you'll be aware of. At first I was irritated by this but I realised that it it simply what happens when some prequels like this film are made. If this sort of thing does irritate you be aware of this and you may end up enjoying it after all. I sound cagey in this respect but I do want to keep this review spoiler free. Just be aware of this as there is special effort made for this film to show its individuality in many respects. <br/><br/>The performances were all good and some very good, Kevin Bacon as Sebastian Shaw occasionally came across as goofy for a villain but showed his worth when he needed to be threatening especially once the third act came along. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender did very well together and had a brilliant rapport. I thought it would have been difficult to replicate this given the chemistry that Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen had in the X-Men trilogy. They did very well together and I really believed their friendship, that is not to mention they do well in scenes when they are not together as well. The other mutants started out fairly same old same old but came into their own at the end. Although despite their somewhat weak introductions as characters I did find myself caring about then once that climax came along. There were scenes with plenty of tension especially involving Erik/Magneto that had a great deal to do with Fassbender's performance. The action involved was consistently good and also wasn't a constant in the film where the focus was very much on the characters and it also made me appreciate the action more when it came. The action got better as the film went on and there was a genuine effort by the film makers to make a film that could be both exciting in terms of action and make it a brilliant character story. <br/><br/>In summary if you enjoyed the previous X-Men films you should enjoy this one as it really makes an effort and the performances while not especially brilliant from the supporting characters were fantastic from the leads. These performances made me want to see McAvoy and Fassbender in these roles again. It features an amusing cameo as well."
"StarkTech","Null","19","34","3 June 2011"," It's textured, layered and flat out FUN. Works on so many levels. Movie of The Year.
","Overall, X-Men is a great film. It features outstanding performances (Fassbender and McAvoy are amazing), a smart script, and plenty of action. I love the fact that when we meet Erik (Fassbender) in this film, his life is more about revenge than anything else. Here, he's a lone wolf and he's on a very specific mission and he's Machiavellian in his approach to whatever ends justify the means. I also loved that we get to see why both Xavier and Erik want to be friends. You see the moment they meet. You don't just start the film and they're buddies and that's exactly what the story requires. We also get to see something quite tragic and deep about their relationship because it's not a small thing that makes it crumble. It's only one element in their relationship but it's as complex as it gets. This film is just so textured and layered and that's refreshing in so many ways.<br/><br/>They really have delivered a rarity in Hollywood – a prequel that not only outperforms the original film, but one that gives the audience credit. If you really want to enjoy the subtleties of First Class you should see at least the first two X-Men first. It's certainly not necessary because this films stands up all on its own but it makes it even more interesting. No time is wasted or needed explaining what they are about to set up but it's fascinating to see these characters introduced and eventually grow to what they become. We're treated to character and story development, expanding the X-Men saga rather than retelling it for everyone whom missed the first installment. Personally, I'm pleasantly amazed that Fox of all studios allowed the release of a blockbuster sequel that doesn't cater to the lowest common denominator. It's refreshing to be treated as something other than a drooling movie-going moron. X-Men First Class works on so many levels and I absolutely love it! <br/><br/>If you are concerned that this film may not live up to the hype, don't be. If this instant classic isn't the best movie of 2011, then this will truly be the best year in cinematic history. First Class is just flat out awesome."
"soul_scion","8","19","34","26 May 2011"," First Class Superhero Movie
","I had the good fortune of being invited out to the media preview of this film yesterday in London and as a result, was tres excited, partly because I had a gut feeling that this film, the fourth in the X-Men franchise, would surpass the two predecessors.<br/><br/>**SPOILERS ALERT*** Anyhow, launching into the content. Twas good, twas very good and I can't speak for the die hard fans of the series but this will be winner for mainstream audiences for sure - and once more restore the super hero genre somewhat. The action sequences were brilliant without being thrown in there just for the hell of it, the performances by James McAvoy as Charles Xavier was right on point and even Michael Fassbender was intense, tortured (and witty!) as Eric (save for the blatant Irish accent creeping in at the end of the film but that's really minor) Special mention goes to Bill Milner, who plays the young Eric - his scene in the Nazi office - enough said.<br/><br/>The film doesn't introduce anything new thematically, as it rotates around the concept of fear and hatred of the new and the misunderstood and questions of what evolution really means – it simply sets up (or rather builds upon, in reverse..?) the two opposing sides that will go on to be represented by Professor X and Magneto. And as most people know, I love going 'back to the start' and revealing what makes characters become who they are. Additionally, the pace carried the film well, considering it was over 2 hours long.<br/><br/>The film and the cast are all beautiful to watch, with solid performances from all, though its McAvoy, Fassbender and Bacon that do the heavy lifting. The score is intense but in parts I felt like it was doing too much of the work.The script was decent as well and there were only perhaps two lines that were lame in all, so for a super hero movie, that's pretty damn good going.<br/><br/>While the mutant characters were engaging enough and felt fully formed, the film painted the rest of humanity as rather dim and grey - I don't fault the movie for that really, it's nigh impossible to show the full spectrum of people but those characters supposedly in power – generals and whatnots, just felt like puppets – but I think that was the point. Talk about ineffective humans – especially those in authority (and doesn't that reflect reality? Ouch!) There were great moments of levity, mostly through Charles Xavier's lines but by far the best sequence was when Eric and Charles team up for the first time and begin recruiting – there's a brilliant inside joke thrown in there that references the original movies – and it had everyone in the cinema laughing.<br/><br/>What's more, on a more broad note, the film does keep that question hanging for you – what would you do if you were the more evolved version of the human species? It's a probing enough question but not one that is overbearing to the content or properly explored - which is a wise move, considering all the other movies pick up on that. So you leave feeling you watched a more than decent superhero movie with fair creditability and lots of fun to boot - that surpassed no. 2 and 3 (which isn't hard but if you get stuck in a formula it could go stale and smell bad, like the Star Wars going back to the beginning nonsense. It didn't do that - it got a new lease of life). Plus, if James McAvoy is in it, there's something of worth there, surely? From"
"james_c9110","8","8","12","29 July 2011"," X-Men First Class – The pre-boot of a dying franchise, directed by Matthew Vaughn (director of Kick Ass) and produced by Bryan Singer (directed X1 and 2), recipe for success?
","Two years have gone by since the release of the last X film; X-Men Origins: Wolverine. This being the origin story of the franchise's most popular character, so naturally expectations were high. However, when the film turned out to be nothing more than an action flick lacking character development, story and general attention to detail many fans, including myself, felt cheated. Rumors of other Origin projects, this time focused on Magneto and Deadpool, took off and fizzled out as soon as X-Men First Class was announced. This at first seemed like a wild stab in the dark for the studio after Wolverine failed to deliver. However, it eventually became clear that it would fill in the history for several main characters at once; Professor X, Magneto, Mystique and Beast, as well as introducing several new heroes and villains to the screen. Sounds too good to be true right? Well fortunately, it isn't!<br/><br/>This film may well be the best X-Men movie to date, rivaling only with X-Men 2. Finally there's something in this film that's been absent from the franchise for far too long: the ability to make us care about the characters. The majority of the film's characters are relatable and have their own personal conflicts such as insecurity, anger and loyalty. These are especially noticeable with James McAvoy's Professor X and Michael Fassbender's Magneto. Both actors have a brilliant fresh take on the characters. Professor X is far less serious than his previous portrayal. Yes he lectures students and advises the FBI, as you'd expect, but he's also out in the field fighting the bad guys with the rest of the team and is out drinking in bars when he's not on the job. He's young and it shows. Magneto here is vengeful, powerful but clearly human. He's been through some pretty dark stuff so has a right to be angry and Professor X knows this. These two together have great chemistry and their friendship feels real, even though we know that ultimately their views will separate them. The rest of the X-Men do get their time to shine, Mystique and Beast also deserve a mention for character chemistry, but they're all ultimately shadowed by Magneto and Professor X who seem to steal the show slightly. Although not all of First Class's villains are convincing, Kevin Bacon's Sebastian Shaw is casually brutal which really works for a threatening bad guy, and the bright red teleporting Azazel (yes, he is pretty much a red Nightcrawler) is pure ninja in a fight.<br/><br/>Moving on to the action, the fights between the X-Men and the Hellfire Club are brilliant and even the training is great to watch. First Class really does have some great jaw dropper moments. Sadly the film does have a weakness, well, depending on how you look at it. First class doesn't quite seem to know where it stands with the other X-Men films in terms of continuity. Hence the term coined at the start of this review; pre-boot. I'm not going to list all the things that stop it from linking up with Origins: Wolverine or X3, but you might just have to pretend those films didn't happen for it to all make sense. Some of us already were anyway"
"theycallmemrglass","9","8","12","22 June 2011"," Greatest ever Prequel movie. This XMEN is truly First Class
","Did the X-men film makers name this entry, First Class because of its quality? That was a bit arrogant of them to do that, isn't it? Well sorry, I think its inappropriate, it should be called X-Men: F**CKING AWESOME! What a movie. As far as prequels go, this is the greatest ( I'm not counting Godfather 2, that was half prequel). This is the only prequel movie of any series or franchise that is better than its originals. This film simply got it right in nearly every area. Mainly and crucially it got it right in the motivation, friendship/enemy developments of the main protagonists, Charles and Erik. The character that truly stands out is Erik/Magneto played brilliantly by Michael Fassbender, an ultra cool, dangerous, yet lost soul enraptured with inner hatred and turmoil. Whenever he gets into action or at an emotional high, he carries the most exciting and thrilling piece of aura about him complemented with a pulsating piece of soundtrack! Soundtracks generally should be subtle to drive a story but here, an exception can be made, as it enhanced an already bad-ass character into something I would disturbingly worship. Charles's journey was also done extremely well (played with incredible zest by James McAvory), as we see him shake off his young slightly womanising immaturity (which was fun to watch) ready to take on a huge responsibility for his own kind and to pursue his belief that there can be harmony between mutants and humans, an ideology that is in complete contrast to his friend Erik's who believes in the survival of his own kind, at any cost. Survival of the fittest. But no film can be truly great without a great villain. That box was ticked by Kevin Bacon's evil evil Nazi general and...boy is he evil and so damn COOL. I think I need help, I am being overdosed with evil coolness.<br/><br/>Its the character drives, motivations, and relationships that truly elevates this superhero film above most others. The pacing was exquisite and energetic. The tone was deliciously vibrant due to its 1960s backdrop. The actors were superb, all of them. Aside from Charles and Erik, Raven/Mystique journey was truly moving. Other characters also had enough attention for us to be interested in their fates. Actors will only perform their best when there is good direction so kudos to a fantastic job by director Matthew Vaughan. The story itself was clever and intriguing, integrating the well known Cuban crisis history with the fictitious mutant evolution.<br/><br/>I admit continuity with previous X-Men films is not tight, it is a bit loose despite obvious references to the previous X-men movies. But I would say it has better continuity than the Star Wars prequels.<br/><br/>There was just so much joy to be had in this film that I feel rather overwhelmed by it as I was not expecting a superhero movie with this kind character depth. Only Nolan's Batman movies retain that crown but this is a different universe, colourful, vibrant, intelligent and truly entertaining."

","As if the X-Men franchise was not complicated enough, what with spin off Wolverine and more to come, we now go back to basics with a prequel set in the 1960's, complete with reasonable period detail.<br/><br/>The film starts, not unsurprisingly, with the cause of Magneto's reason to hate. Mother and young son are swept up in the persecution of Jews, led by a scene stealing Nazi doctor, Sebastian Shaw. Kevin Bacon, an inspired and unlikely casting choice for this particular role. Whether such background material is suitable for a pure entertainment film, is perhaps debatable but the opening scene is strong and very effective.<br/><br/>Perhaps anything that makes a new generation hit Wikipedia to find out more, is no bad thing.<br/><br/>Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto (Fassbender) has every intention of enjoying his revenge stone cold and follows the ex-Nazi trail through South America and ending with an early standoff with his nemesis. There follows a very effective SFX scene with a quite spectacular use of a super yachts anchor chain, possibly the most realistic CGI sequence in the film.<br/><br/>The story switches to Charles Xavier (James McAvoy), initially using his telepathic powers to seduce women in leafy Oxford, whilst attempting to persuade his sister Raven/Mystique (Lawrence) that turning blue occasionally is really not the end of the world.<br/><br/>Charles and Erik come together in an uneasy friendship, following Erik's doomed attempt to kill Sebastian and his henchwoman Emma Frost (January Jones), a character that struggles to keep her clothes on throughout the film.<br/><br/>The pair come to the attention of the CIA via agent MacTaggert (Rosie Byrne), who discovers mutants led by Sebastian, are keen to push both the USSR and USA towards World War III. A task made easier as the Cuban missile crisis looms large with the very real possibility of nuclear Armageddon.<br/><br/>The CIA initially are somewhat reluctant to trust the mutants, but subsequently realise their potential and place them under the very loose control of MIB agent (Oliver Platt), who happens to have a ready built facility for just such an eventuality.<br/><br/>The team recruits more mutants and soon we have, Beast (Hoult), Havoc (Lucas Till), Darwin (Gathegi) and Angel (Kravitz) in training for the coming battle ahead.<br/><br/>The film is a risky move, prequels or reboots are not always successful; certainly we have a talented cast, good script and competent director in the form of Matthew Vaughan. The studio knows that a successful restart should spawn at least another film, if not two.<br/><br/>On the basis of this film they need not worry, this as good as it gets for a comic book reboot. X-Men never intended to emulate the moral complexity and darkness of the Batman franchise, the series always represented a brighter, more colourful world and that tone generally continues here.<br/><br/>There are certainly plenty of scantily clad women to attract the target audience but they do get some decent screen time and something to do, notably Jones and Byrne.<br/><br/>There is occasional humour to lighten the mood and Fassbender and MacAvoy make a good job of recreating the characters we already know. Bacon is a stand out, especially in the earlier scenes, although there is the faintest whiff of Austin Powers as the story progresses but this is a minor quibble.<br/><br/>The film does lag slightly in the middle phase, after a very strong start but picks up for a rousing although necessarily CGI heavy, send off. Most loose ends are tidied up and the stage is set for X-Men the ""middle years"".<br/><br/>Whether audiences need another rebooted comic book franchise, remains to be seen but this is quality fare and certainly no quick cash in.<br/><br/>Summary <br/><br/>Yet another comic book blockbuster but representing solid entertainment, with some fine character recreation, excellent effects and an unusually strong storyline.<br/><br/>Recommended <br/><br/>http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.com/"
"nikpathak","9","8","12","14 June 2011"," Mutant (fan) and Proud!!
","WOW... honestly this one is a genre-defining movie on a level with only some comic based films that have come before it. Though the Dark Knight was a god sent and a true testament to how every adaptation of a once thought ""kid"" genre can make big waves on the big screen – this one is certainly close behind and can be labeled as Batman begins of the X-men series. When you emerge through this wonder – on - screen film after a good 2+ hours, you feel proud to be X–men fan (mutants and proud).. . It's intelligent, enthralling, well-acted, stylishly directed, and most important focusing heavily on content rather than larger than life conventional super-hero films. Should they hide being a mutant, or should they have mutant pride? This question has been the foundation of nearly all of the X-Men films, so this may not be new territory, but the examination of how Charles and Erik become Professor X and Magneto, is what this movie is truly about<br/><br/>There are plenty of kick-ass action scenes throughout but it's the first half of the film that really impresses. Painstakingly establishing these characters and the entire universe webbed around the real life events of World War is done remarkably well to intricately weave the context of the Cuban Missile Crisis in the early 1960's. A lot of the time prequels to films can be pretty pointless, since you basically know how it's all going to turn out, but this film is that rare kind of prequel that actually succeeds despite us knowing where it's all going to lead to in the long run. The first thirty minutes jet all the way from Oxford, England, to Vegas, to Switzerland, to Argentina, Germany, and Rochester, New York. There are tons of building blocks that are laid in the first half, but the movie makes the transition from the foundation rocks to a suave tower, smooth and natural, a feat that is hard to explain in words, but makes the difference upon viewing the film.<br/><br/>Almost all actors are perfect, one might almost say forcefully, cast. McAvoy brings an excellent charm to Charles Xavier, and Michael Fassbender's Magneto can be compared with Darth wader style anti-hero origins (where the sky-walker character is transformed to a villain not be birth but by circumstance) rather than an downright evil characterization of the character in the other sequels. This could hardly be called a breakout role after the '300' performance, but it sure has elevated his status to lead role material. The other worthy notable younger cast is Jennifer Lawrence as the petite – vulnerable Raven. Aside from the script, it would also be rude to not praise the action-sequences which take place within the confines of the 1960's universe (Dear Director, the painstaking effort of showing vintage cars in a Nevada – Las Vegas set up is noted; bravo !!). Add to it the well-choreographed action sequences (just perfect – the thing which iron man II lacked) that are not over-the board but would adequately satisfy all the sci-fi fans wishing to see this film. The difference though is, while super-hero movies tend to concentrate on the aesthetic nature, where the super hero somehow has the super powers and the knowledge to use it, here it is shown and constantly emphasized that even though the characters have the power, they need to learn to channelize it.<br/><br/>The best part about what makes this movie a 'stand alone' blockbuster is the fact that a first time viewer of X-men series as well as an ardent fan would be equally entertained (For anyone uneducated about X-Men, First Class is an absorbing introduction. And best of all, it's not jumped on the 3D bandwagon just for the sake of it). However if one subtly divorces oneself from almost all established four-color X-Men continuity; the real class of the movie would stand apart. Can't think of a prequel in recent time which has done a reboot of epic proportions so much; that you actually can bank on fans scrambling back to watch the earlier versions in a quest to calm the urge to have joined the missing blocks mentally.<br/><br/>'X-Men: First Class,' is not your typical comic-book movie, it may contain certain elements associated with the comic-book genre, but by placing a heavy emphasis upon the strength of the plot and the script at the film's core, Vaughn has intended, and succeeded, in transcending the stereotypical conventions of the genre and has created a film which will appeal to a wide range of audience and not just sci-fi fans. With ""X Men: First Class"", Vaughn has infused new life into a franchise that was just looking to be fading with its bland ""Last Stand"" version and ""Wolverine"" spin off. Vaughn's re imagining of the X Men universe is more than robust, especially with an intelligent tightly-plotted script, outstanding lead performances and thrilling action sequences. Vaughn's grittiness of a ""Layer Cake"" and the superhero fun of 'Kick ass' was elevated to a completely new level in this film"
"ayoreinf","9","8","12","14 June 2011"," it's the X men can't help but love'em
","The X-Men are my favorite comic. The closest sci-fi comics ever got to real science fiction. Un like most comics its characters are far from cartoons, they're 3D characters - so no wonder they didn't need to add the special effect. The movie was true to these aspects of the comic, it even kept some of the original story, I wish it was even closer, but understand the wish to tell the story differently so I'm pleased with the fact that the concept remained the same. Using a real historic event as the backdrop to the story is also a good addition. And above all the actors all give their share to the final outcome. Kevin Bacon is superb, Michael Fassbender also excels. But as I said they all do well, and once you believe the characters and the story is good, what else is there to ask.<br/><br/>To sum it all: keeping the tradition of good X-man renditions in-fact it's better than the last of the original trio (didn't see Wolverine yet). So if you like the comic - go see it, if you like good thought provoking sci-fi go see it too, if you're none of the above you probably won't be reading this at all so that's it."
"uareariot","1","38","76","4 June 2011"," If you know x-men you will not want to see this movie
","First if you don't know jack about x-men except for the movies that came out. You might like this movie. IF you know anything about the x-men at all then you will hate this movie.<br/><br/>First lets go over the list of the original X-Men. Professor X: Check Cyclops: nope Jean Grey: nope Beast: Check Angel: Nope Iceman: Nope<br/><br/>Seeing how this is supposed to be the beginning to the movies it's half understandable not to have them in there as they appear later on in the movies that have already come out. However i have issues with the characters they did choose.<br/><br/>Magneto: never was an xman yet here he is. Mystique: also never an xman and is also the mother of Nightcrawler. Banshee: Finally someone who was an x-man at some point. He was never a kid when he was with the x-men and also he is from Ireland. No accent in the movie. Beast: Ah, here we have an original x-man. But what's this his mutation is big hand feet until he tries to cure himself? That's stupid. Also this does not even follow the movies where it shows him on t.v. as a normal person not yet transformed to the blue beast we know and love. However, the actor portraying him did a good job so i accept this change for the movie, if only that was the only thing the messed up. Angel: What's this? You said Angel wasn't in the movie! HE ISN'T! Instead some girl with insect wings who shoots crappy like puff balls out of her mouth is here and she calls herself angel cuz that was her stripper name. When she called herself angel i almost walked out of the movie theater. Havok: Cyclops' little brother.... as a teenager in the early 60's which pretty much makes him old enough to be cyclops father according to the xmen movie time line. Isn't this movie supposed to preclude the previous xmen movies??? Inconsistencies with the comic is one thing but with your own movies? Come on you can do better. Professor X: didn't mind how they portrayed him. Darwin: Who? The black guy who they killed off pretty quick.<br/><br/>Also many inconsistencies with other characters i won't go in to.<br/><br/>All in all this movie is a spit in the face to people who are x-men fans. Good action and good special effects don't make up for that fact."
"CaptainxBumout","9","15","26","16 June 2011"," Excellent movie.
","Now I'm sure everyone knows who the X-Men are and know about this movie. The trailer really didn't look impressive at all and if I wasn't such a huge Michael Fassbender fan, I probably would have waited to see this movie on DVD. I saw this the day it was released but my computer got a virus so I haven't been able to get a review out until now.<br/><br/>Keep in mind I'm a little biased since my favorite actor plays Magneto but I absolutely loved this movie. Sure this isn't about the original X-Men but I feel like movies and comic books are two different entities and if you like one and not the other then that's fine. I used to get upset about stuff not being faithful adaptations but now I don't care since all it does is help people find out about something and they hopefully want to find out more about it and find the original material.<br/><br/>The thing that makes this movie so great is that it's not really a superhero movie. I mean sure there are mutants with powers but this movie puts way more emphasis on the story and the main characters as opposed to nonstop action or way to many mutants with powers like in X-Men The Last Stand. This movie is basically a drama with superheroes in it. They utilized Fassbender and McAvoy to a great extent and Jennifer Lawrence (Mystique) and Kevin Bacon (Sebastian Shaw) did great as well.<br/><br/>I liked that they made the movie very dark (as dark as they could make it for PG13) much like The Dark Knight but added in a fair amount of light hearted moments. Magneto was a dark serious person while Professor X was more of an easy going guy. I thought it was a nice touch in seeing how he acted when he was young.<br/><br/>Of course there are a couple of nit picks I have with the movie. The kids weren't really given enough screen time but I guess it gave you just enough for the first movie and hopefully we get to see more of them in sequels. Also I liked January Jones in Mad Men but she really does not do any good as Emma Frost. Sure she's good to look at but she's given most of the screen time out of Kevin Bacons henchmen which is weird since she can't really act well. Also I don't think Azazel and Riptide even talk at all during the movie.<br/><br/>Overall this has been my favorite movie so far this year. I plan on seeing Super 8 this week so we'll see if that can top this movie. 9/10"
"MLeoCasas","4","9","14","21 February 2013"," Doesn't Hold Up
","I think the novelty of watching the birth of big names in this story has clouded a lot of peoples judgement. <br/><br/>Big storytelling problems:<br/><br/>1)The origins of both Magneto and Xavier were really sprinted through at the beginning of the movie. <br/><br/>2)The idea of Mystique being Xavier's foster sister not only isn't as interesting as her comic book origins, but also has absolutely no link in the original movie trilogy that this movie is supposed to precede.<br/><br/>3) This being the origin of the war (a war at least as politically, militarily and motivationally complex- and longer- than the historical Cold War) between mutants and humans, there was a lot of opportunity here to showcase more than the development of the school. I get that the complexity of the comic book world can't be compacted into thee films, but while watching the original trilogy I found this fantasy world far more challenging and interesting. <br/><br/>4) Kind of an addition to number 3: Magneto and Xavier's brief discussions about their opposing viewpoints come off so one sided in Charles' favor. The metaphorical subject matter here is oversimplified to a point where there is very little relatability and empathy with Magneto. Even for those of us (the vast majority) who disagree with Magneto, the original films did a far better job of bringing his humanity and personal struggle to light. One of the most extraordinary aspects of the X-men canon is it's realistic reflection of morality. What is morality? Does something have to be right or wrong? Does intent or motivation factor in any way? These questions were present in the comic books and weighed in heavily in the trilogy...they get lost in a Superman-esque depiction of Xavier's moral code pitted against Shaw's psychopathic rampage here in the prequel.<br/><br/>5) By having mutants be directly responsible for the entire Cold War (like ALL of it. Like against the will of humans...) a lot of metaphorical resonance is lost in the following story. These historical events helped shape our understanding and analysis of this fantasy world. That they have been ENTIRELY manipulated by the fantasy world itself is somewhat cheapening.<br/><br/>6) Almsot every human was very caricatureesque. It was very cartoony and hard to take seriously.<br/><br/>FIlmmaking Problems:<br/><br/>1) the CGI and special effects were a little lacking for 2011. I;m not sure how this happened, this franchise seems pretty big budget.<br/><br/>2) The screenplay was super half-**ss. This movie was scripted so that a blind man could understand every emotional detail. Even then though, the character development is shoddy and tends to leap in some way from one place to another throughout the film. The exceptions here being Magneto and Xavier....who hardly show any development at all. Their Friendship is a foot note, and their characters are at every stage fundamentally the same as the stage before. Too simple for young adult audiences.<br/><br/>3) Supposing you're one of those people who are like ""Dude, shut up, I watched this for action, adventure, bad**ss visuals..."" i give you that that's totally part of the magic of the both comics and movies...but were you satisfied with sh*t like banshees lame flight scenes? Or Magento's underwhelming displays of power? Or how about Havok's greatest display of strength being his cutting a statue in half? The one scene with any good edge of your seat action was when Shaw raids the military base. Period.<br/><br/>4) The villains, without exception, were hard to watch because they were all acted poorly and given very little exposure.<br/><br/>Sidenotes:<br/><br/>-The wolverine cameo was stupid and gimmicky.<br/><br/>-The beach scene was anticlimactic.<br/><br/><ul><li>Magneto blaming Moira for Charles' injury lasted about 30 seconds and either needed to be elaborated upon or cut entirely.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Charles telling Raven to go with Eric was indefensibly stupid, uncharacteristic and again, in no way relevant to the story of the trilogy.</li></ul><br/><br/>-Who chose the lineup of mutants here? Just super underwhelming. And none of them do anything too cool with their powers. It was like watching a b-string circus. I'll admit I'm kind of excited see if Mystique and Azazel's affair and Nightcrawler are incorporated in the future though.<br/><br/><ul><li>Jennifer Lawrence, Nicholas Hoult and James McAvoy gave the only good performances in this movie, and even then (with he exception of McAvoy, who seems to genuinely be trying to squeeze water from a stone here) the performances are brought down by the story, screenplay and generally poor filmmaking.</li></ul><br/><br/>This is a really successful franchise...like really very successful. Who OKed this? How many people were down, read/watched/reviewed this before it's release and were like ""looks good to me."" Seriously. This movie didn't hold up to precedent, and without the novelty, if the comic books and trilogy hadn't been around, it would have flopped very very hard."
"Coolphill","10","19","35","1 June 2011"," Movie of the year!!!
","WOW!!! Mathew Vaughn has done it again! This absolutely wipes the floor with x men origins wolverine and X men the last stand, and in my opinion is even better then x men 1 and 2. The story is so well told, all the characters are brilliantly fleshed out and every one of them either has a really interesting character arc or is just awesome or funny. The script is perfect ranging from effective humour, to really dark but emotional scenes (especially a stand out one in a concentration camp), the action is both inventive and astounding with some very clever uses of powers. But the best thing about this is how well every character is explored and how they show some real depth here, in my opinion this is even better intellectually then the dark knight. Everyone gives a great performance too. Nicholaus Hault brings pain and frustration to the character of beast expertly, as does Jenifer Laurence to the character of mystique. but ultimately this is a film about Charles and Erik and when they need to James Mcavoy and Michel Fassbender really display magnificent acting capabilities and presence, the film charts those two coming together as friends and then falling apart, and it does so brilliantly and there performances cement this. I cant recommend X- men first class enough See more"

","Just like X2, First Class is a film classic that will endure and resonate for years to come. Bring on the Next Class! <br/><br/>Both Erik and Charles are two of the coolest and most charismatic characters to ever hit the big screen. Now I know why Magneto was reading ""The Man Who Would Be King"" in X2! I really love this film. The acting is superb and the dialogue is rich. Every character feels believable. No cartoonish villains, every side of the issue is presented by people who believe they are the ones who are in the right, and honestly felt that way. This movie delivers on its characters, and the action scenes are there only to advance plot and build character, and that's the best kind of action sequences. The X-Men have hit their stride again and while still at Fox... go figure! <br/><br/>Xavier is a fleshed out and complex character. Mystique proves why she's a fan favorite. Magneto is a vicious but charming and persuasive bastard. Hank is a tragic and endearing figure. Alex is filled with emotion. Darwin is pure empathy. Emma is as sexy as sin. Shaw is a perfect villain. The FX is Oscar worthy. What's not to love?"

","It's not very often you get a fourth film in a franchise that's of high quality (though I guess this is technically the fifth, if you count X-Men Origins: Wolverine), but X-Men: First Class manages to buck the trend and reinvigorate the series. A lot of the time prequels to films can be pretty pointless, since you basically know how it's all going to turn out, but this film is that rare kind of prequel that actually *succeeds* despite us knowing where it's all going to lead to in the long run. What makes this story interesting is that there are some surprises along the way, such as the fact that Charles Xavier met Raven Darkholme/Mystique as a child and they were good friends growing up. Then there's the matter of how Charles wound up in a wheelchair. The circumstances surrounding how he became paralyzed may surprise you.<br/><br/>A large part of what makes First Class successful is the casting. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender are at the centre of the story this time around as Charles Xavier and Erik Lehnsherr, and both actors convincingly portray younger versions of the characters first brought to life by Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen in the original X-Men movie. McAvoy plays a different kind of Xavier than you might be expecting, but despite the difference in personality to his older self, you can nevertheless see how he will turn into the wise person we know he will become. Meanwhile, Fassbender is exceptional as a young Erik. His rage and impatience for humans and those who wronged him in the past, combined with the fact that he is not straight-out ""evil"", makes him a complex villain-to-be.<br/><br/>Then there's Raven, played awesomely by Oscar nominee Jennifer Lawrence. Watching her relationship with Charles from a young age allows us to see a side of Mystique we have never gotten previously. Their friendship is another great dynamic in the film, which allows for some very memorable/emotional scenes. You can understand why she feels the way she does, and what her issues are. And while Charles starts out as a close friend/brother type to her, it is Erik who really knows Raven and what she yearns for: acceptance for who she is. Hank McCoy (soon to become Beast), played by Nicholas Hoult, is another who is struggling with his outward appearance - courtesy of him having hands for feet. There's a romance between Raven and Hank that starts to blossom, and the two of them together are far less forced than the romantic relationships that plagued the previous films. They can understand where each is coming from, but sadly Hank makes the mistake of thinking they *should* hide their true appearances and he's a bit of a shallow jerk to Raven at one point. However, Erik encourages her to embrace her true identity and accept who she is - which is important, given that she decides to join his side in the end (the scenes between Raven and Erik, although brief, are excellent). In lesser hands, the younger versions of Mystique and Beast would not have been nearly as successful as they are, but Lawrence and Hoult are perfectly cast and bring much depth and nuance to them. The lovely and talented Jennifer Lawrence gives an especially stand-out performance.<br/><br/>Kevin Bacon makes quite the effective villain as Sebastian Shaw, and his right-hand woman, Emma Frost (Mad Men's January Jones) is definitely dazzling when she's showing off her diamond form.<br/><br/>Other characters on both the 'good' and 'bad' sides are given less to do and some are developed more than others, with varying degrees of success. The young X-Men recruits provide some entertainment when they're together, hanging out and (thanks to Raven) crafting code names for themselves. It's good that we got these scenes of them bonding together as a group, because before too long, everything goes to hell. There are casualties, betrayals and switching of sides.<br/><br/>The writers have crafted a very fine film that should restore faith in the X-Men franchise that perhaps some people had lost after that last couple. Director Matthew Vaughn ensures that you are never bored throughout this movie, his direction maintaining interest the whole way through - though not because of an overload of effects. Story is put first this time around, and First Class is all the better for it. There's not this need to throw CGI about all willy-nilly simply to keep you invested. It's the human drama between the characters which makes this film stand out. Having said that, when the effects do eventually come on display, they are quite something.<br/><br/>Some might have issues/questions regarding continuity between this film and the ones before it, but I was surprised by how much thought actually went into making this film fit with the others (even going so far as to match the first film's opening scene almost shot for shot). There's numerous nods to the previous films and characters, some more subtle than others, not to mention two memorable cameos - which come in the form of Hugh Jackman (who gets a great one-liner as Wolverine) and Rebecca Romijn (a clever nod to future Mystique).<br/><br/>It's not often that a franchise manages to bounce back after becoming rather lacklustre (and without rebooting everything), but this one definitely succeeds at it. And if the quality of this film can be maintained, here's hoping for more adventures with these young mutants."
"daniyalkhan857","8","4","5","2 April 2015"," X-Men: First Class (2011)
","The Movie is simply fantastic. Strong emotion and explosive action. The acting is top notch. Delivery from every actor is at it's best, more so from Mystique, Beast, Xavier and Magneto. What I also like about First Class is that the movie takes place in the past (the sixties) and uses historical events (the Cuba crisis and the Cold War) to make its point. Erik claims that no matter how many times mutants save the world, normal people will always see them as enemies. Professor X still wants to believe in the good of the people. With that message the foundation is laid for X-Men 1-3.<br/><br/>Overall, this isn't a bad movie, it's a good movie! It's a fun Blockbuster Summer action film to enjoy with your friends. See the movie!"
"MBunge","7","4","5","10 June 2011"," Fits perfectly well alongside the first two X-flicks
","The fairest things you can say about X-Men: First Class is that it is clearly at least the 3rd best X-film, it may be the best written movie that's ever credited 6 people for the story and screenplay and it is absolutely one of the best prequels that's ever been made. Those all sound like more backhanded compliments that I intend or this motion picture deserves, but they are the most accurate descriptions I can come up with.<br/><br/>Set primarily in the early 1960s, the story concerns how Professor X (James McEvoy) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender) met and began their lifelong enmity over the place of mutants in human society. They're brought together by their pursuit of Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon). Magneto is after him for Shaw killing his mother and torturing him as a boy in a Nazi concentration camp. Professor X has allied himself with the CIA and is after Shaw to stop him from starting a nuclear war between the U.S. and the USSR, something Shaw thinks will destroy humanity and empower mutantkind. Each side assembles their own team, with shape-changing Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) among the good mutants and telepathic lingerie fan Emma Frost (January Jones) highlighting the bad guys.<br/><br/>The Martin Luther King Jr. vs Malcolm X dynamic between Professor X and Magneto is blended with a plot and visual style straight out of a 1960s spy movie. Now, it's more like a really good Matt Helm flick than James Bond, but these filmmakers use that groovy look and sensibility to create one of the best representations of classic super-hero imagery without it feeling too ""comic booky"". By funneling super-hero tropes through the 60s spy genre, it almost effortlessly normalizes them without having to compromise them.<br/><br/>The script juggles a big cast better than any other X-film and about as well as any action flick ever has. Yeah, most of them are cannon fodder or cardboard stand ins, but they're never obtrusive or annoying and they all orbit quite well around the quartet at the heart of the story. The mutant vs. human debate of Professor X and Magento is unfolded into an assimilation vs. racial pride standoff between Mystique and the Beast (Nicholas Hoult). The script even manages to expertly mirror its era by giving Magneto the revolutionary appeal of 1960s social turmoil, and casting Professor X as too weak and accommodating, which deliciously plays off the template of the first two X-films where Magneto was the aging radical still grasping at revolution while the Professor's approach had actually built something meaningful and lasting.<br/><br/>The action scenes are good, though they become less effective as they become more overtly super-heroic. There are a couple of tremendous cameos. The continuity of the first two X-films is mostly respected and enhanced. And this movie finally resolves an argument that started with the original motion picture. Yes, Magneto's comic book helmet does look kind of goofy when you faithfully reproduce in the real world.<br/><br/>First Class doesn't have the dramatic depth of X-Men or United, but it's a fun, funny and exciting summer experience. It's a shame the flaws of The Last Stand or Wolverine may have soured folks on mutant cinema and scared them away from this one but if you enjoyed the first two films at all, you should definitely give this one a look."

","OK so first off why make this movie after they made X Men Origins Wolverine? Am I the only one that noticed Professor X walking towards the end of X Men Origins Wolverine? At the end of this film they showed him getting shot and being wheeled around in a wheel chair.<br/><br/>I am thoroughly disappointed with Stan Lee and his decision to make this god awful film. And I am appalled at how many fans like this film. If you want to support the X Men stick to the comics at least they have an excuse for messing up the story line by adding whole series and they end up being a dream or something. Like when Wolverine dies my favorite comic by far. Look I cant tell you what to do but before you waste your money on this terrible film think about how upsetting I must be to write this review. I LOVE X Men but not the movies. If you are a true fan you will skip this film and not believe the reviews by other people who are probably getting payed to write them."

After you succeed to reset and empty your brain, clear your memory and deactivate your judging abilities (I.Q=0), then you will have prepared yourself properly to accept passively, without resistance all action in the movie and then you'll truly enjoy it as a life-time experience, until the last line of the credits! <br/><br/>Still in that brainless condition with a dumb, frozen smile in your face, you'll come back here and add a raving review about the awesomeness of the movie! Then, you'll become automatically a member of the Next Brainwashed Generation!<br/><br/>Unfortunately they target mostly the teenagers -vulnerable, with no mature shields yet..."

","It's a complete terrible tedious rubbish of a movie. All positive reviews here are fake! The story was very boring. The SR-71 Blackbird aircraft should only have one or, rarely, two seats, and it is not hollow inside. The submarine had a way too large interior for its size, not to mention its interior was completely unrealistic. The scene with the missiles at the end was embarrassing to watch. I'm not sure why there are so many positive reviews. One might begin to wonder whether somebody is manipulating the system. And how could this movie possibly have an 8.0 rating? I no longer trust IMDb and its ratings. IMDb has become corrupt, unfortunately. I demand that IMDb does something to fix this."
"aaroncrews","8","5","7","23 June 2011"," Best X-flick behind X2. I love you Michael Fassbender
","Man V. Freak Evolution has a new name By Ryan Crews 3.5/4 Stars<br/><br/>There once was a tale of a more evolved human kind. A band of outcasts known as the future: the mutant kind. Their story has been and continues to be told through an up and running X-Men franchise, made fresh by its latest installment, X-Men: First Class. First Class is a world class prequel that exposes the pasts of two old chums (as they are seen in the original films: X-1, 2, & 3). Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto (a five-star performance by Michael Fassbender) and Charles Xavier/Professor X (a jolting James McAvoy) join forces to defeat the energy absorbing antagonist, Sebastian Shaw (an evil-intent Kevin Bacon) and his squad of mutant baddies with mutant domination on their mind. The film delves into Fassbender's (Inglorious Basterds) medal-bending maniac's soul-driven desire for revenge against the Nazi regime that stole away his family and into McAvoy's (Atonement) telepathic visions of a mutant and human co-existence. As Lehnsherr misinterprets fascist hatred as the foundation of all human nature, his innocence is lost which develops the passion of Magneto's inner Frankenstein monster. The hatred brewed turns him into the very same prejudiced man that he preys upon, impervious to McAvoy's philanthropic attempts at getting in his head. The direction by Matthew Vaughn (Kick-Ass) pays homage to Bryan Singer's take on the first two films which adds a depth to the X-Men that had not shown up in the past two installments (The Last Stand and Wolverine). Its storyline is as intriguing as a superhero plot gets. It plants the X-Men straight into the 60's Cuban Missile Crisis and morphs history to its advantage to add to the powerful effect of the film, and the effect is groovy baby. Nicholas Hoult is ferocious as the mad scientist, Hank McCoy/Beast. He comes in and leaves a mark almost as if asking what would a comic book movie be without the nerds? The only weak side of the acting pool comes from Mrs. Betty Draper herself, January Jones (Mad Men) who plays a very comic book feeling villain known as Emma Frost. Frost could have been a dynamic, cinematic creation if only Jones didn't look like she was just there to look hot and read her lines. First Class is full of spectacular visual effects, intense, crafty acting (congrats, Fassbender for the role of the year, so far) and cerebral summer fun without all of the worries of skin cancer. It's an enthralling ride that gets in your mind like Xavier himself as it is full of freaks, geeks, and mystique's (pun intended, nerds). It's totally worth a single days pool-fair."

","I've seen all the X-Men movies and I wasn't sure if I would have liked this one, too. I didn't like James McAvoy that much and I feared that this movie could prove a letdown. I was wrong. The movie is great, well directed, CGI good to watch without being more important than the movie itself and - most of all - the acting was really good. McAvoy and Fassbender were great in depicting Xavier and Erik. Their emotions look real, not acted, their chemistry great. And the other characters work well, too, villains and good guys. I liked also the Bondesque style of the part during the 60s. Drama and humour are well mixed and they give depth to a good action movie. Just a last line: Magneto is right in distrusting humans."
"ssvikas","7","6","9","14 June 2011"," Quality acting and a fresh story!
","The success of the prequel, X-Men Origins: Wolverine in 2009 seems to have prompted the movie makers to shift focus to prequels. In First Class, the story goes back even further and traces the lives of Professor-X/ Charles Xavier and Magneto/ Erik Lehnsherr, their friendship and their eventual fallout. <br/><br/>Although the X-Men trilogy had done good business in the last decade, prolonging the same would have meant more battles between Xavier's X-men and Magneto's Brotherhood of mutants on their differences on how to deal with humans. But, in a prequel, the story can be altered; which is conveniently explained as a 'reboot'. <br/><br/>The film introduces us to young Erik Lenhsherr who loses his parents during the holocaust. The rage triggers his mutant powers of magnetism which the Nazis seek to tame. Cut to his adulthood, a grown up Erik (Michael Fassbender) seeks revenge. Simultaneously, we are shown Charles Xavier's (James McAvoy) opulent childhood, his gift for mind-control and growing up with Raven/ Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence).<br/><br/>Set in the 60's during the Cuban missile crisis, it involves a fictional plot with Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) who is keen to trigger World War III and usher in a mutant rule. We are shown that Shaw was formerly the German official who spotted Erik's powers and is a mutant supervillian. The CIA seeks Xavier's help to tackle Shwaw. Erik and Xavier's paths converge as they join hands to thwart Shaw. <br/><br/>In a way, the story belongs to Magneto. He's not shown to be a villain but someone who carries scars of the holocaust which, in a way, has desensitized him from connecting with humans. Fassbender's lone-wolf portrayal, Machiavellian approach, styling and a Cold War backdrop bear an uncanny resemblance to James Bond flicks. Needless to say, he's done exceedingly well to carry off his role.<br/><br/>James McAvoy is credible as the mentor to his creed and also helping Erik harness his powers sans rage. Curiously, barring Xavier's British accent, none of the others, especially Erik & Shaw seem to speak with an accent reflecting their ancestry. Other characters like Raven, Emma Frost or Hank had the potential but weren't emphasized. <br/><br/>As much as the story took its liberties, the end couldn't have been anything else. Magneto had to turn against humans and Xavier had to end up in a wheelchair. The problem is that the ending looks rushed and hardly spends much time on the 'why' of things, and that too parting ways when their mentor, Xavier was badly hit.<br/><br/>First Class also differs from its predecessors since it doesn't rely excessively on special effects or high octane thrills associated with this genre. Still, it has people flying, disappearing, a bit of fire, ships and people levitated, etc., all without a minute being wasted. It offers enough to satiate action-hungry fans. In all, it's a worthwhile watch."
"EvangelionManFromTheOtherSide","8","7","11","19 June 2011"," Nicely crafted, and full of originality.
","There are many moviegoers, who are annoyed by the constant releases of superhero movies. Some may even say that superhero flicks are ""the reason behind Hollywood's decline in quality."" I really disagree with what these people say. Superhero movies can be fun to watch, but not all of them are great. I think the major flaw with recent comic book-based movies is that they lack originality, the thing that allows to distinguish one superhero film from another. Yes, I sometimes think that some superhero flicks are the same in terms of content, except with different powers. <br/><br/>However, X-Men: First Class was something new, something... original. Since the film is a prequel, originality was the last thing I expected. First Class felt like a brand new film, free from its predecessors. It had charm as a distinct superhero flick, something that Vaughn's previous film, Kick-Ass, came to lose as the film progressed. Although it had its own flaws, X-Men: First Class did not get tedious as the film progressed, and I think it's one of the best superhero films of the last few years.<br/><br/>As the title (mildly) implies, the movie focuses on the origins and early days of the X-Men. It is also set in the backdrop of Cold War. Charles Xavier is a telepath who takes interest in other mutants, and hopes for society to accept them. Erik Lensherr is a Jew, who is hunting down former Nazis as revenge for the death of his mother. As the tensions between America and the Soviet Union rises, Charles is recruited by the CIA to stop mutant Sebastian Shaw and his Hellfire Club, who are planning to start a third World War. At the same time, Erik attempts to complete his revenge job by killing Shaw, who was the man responsible for killing his mother. Eventually, Charles and Erik meet and form a friendship. Together, they recruit young mutants for the CIA, in hopes of stopping the Hellfire Club and their diabolical plans. <br/><br/>The well-assembled cast was basically the high point of the film. McAvoy nails his performance as young Charles Xavier. But the scene stealer of the film was Fassbender, who ""magnifying"" as young Magneto. In addition to the two main leads, the supporting characters were also nicely cast. Lawrence, as Mystique, was a great replacement for Romijn. I've yet see Winter's Bones, but seeing her performance in First Class brings up expectations for the film. Kevin Bacon's role as main antagonist Sebastian Shaw was fantastic. It was like seeing a combination of his role in Hollow Man (mediocre movie) and Frost/Nixon (great film). Byrne, again, was typecast as ""a morally righteous character"", playing CIA agent Moira MacTaggert. Byrne, as an actress, is really underrated, but most of the characters she portrays are too similar to one another. Platt played a minor, yet quite likable character, the Man in Black. Seeing him getting killed off during the first hour of the movie was disappointing. Did he really need to die so early? Wait, I reinstate. Did he even need to die in the first place? Ironically, I wanted his character in 2012 to die in a painful death, yet he survived in the film. Jackman reprises his role as Wolverine in a cameo, and it's absolutely hilarious.<br/><br/>The thing that First Class did that X-Men: Wolverine did not was it allowed the audience to view humanity again, like in Singer's films. Although I enjoyed it, Wolverine was too concentrated on the revenge concept to be called really good. In my opinion, making the film a fictional biography would've made it more inspiring. First Class also allowed the audience to see the philosophy of mutants in society from two perspectives: Xavier's belief that society will one day accept mutants, and the belief of Erik that mutants must make their own ""brotherhood"" within society. In the previous X-Men films, the latter idea was not emphasized enough. Indeed, it was brought up, but First Class made it much more relatable. <br/><br/>The CGI was quite detrimental to the quality of the film. It's better than the bloated effects of Prince of Persia, but it still didn't look convincing enough. Especially the part when the submarine washes ashore on the island. When it comes to superhero films, visual effects are pretty much essential, and the VFX of First Class was not pretty.<br/><br/>The writing served as quite a problem for the film. The story and the characters were written fine, but the dialogue had quite the problems. Mystique/Raven's (repeated) line to the Beast, for example, was beyond clichéd. Also, Magneto final line was not really stunning. Criticizing clichéd dialogues in blockbusters may not be an obligation. Still, the scripting in First Class felt like an exception.<br/><br/>Incorporating the Cuban missile crisis into the plot was the best thing that ever happened in a X-Men film. I'm quite fond of seeing actual historical elements in fictional stories. Hence why I loved the storyline of Metal Gear Sold 3, which also utilized Cold War aspects within the fictional mythology of the series. Kennedy appears in an archive footage, by the way.<br/><br/>Overall, Vaughn has done a fine job crafting a unique superhero flick. As I've said earlier, the CGI was far from being an Oscar contender, and the dialogue suffers from predictability to laziness. Nevertheless, the cast and its direction make the film highly enjoyable. X-Men: First Class is a great way to spend two hours with solid entertainment. If the new X-Men films continue to be more like First Class, then I don't mind the franchise continuing for another ten years."
"scottshak_111","9","7","11","15 June 2011"," Sheer Class! Sheer First Class !!!!!!!!
","Matthew, the mighty, Vaughn. I've seen all four of his movies and I must say he has never disappointed me so far. Layer Cake is still the most mind-boggling movie of all times. I can't get rid of Stardust from my mind and Kick-ass is the finest flick I've ever come across and my collection still retains it(Waiting for the sequel Kick-Ass 2: Balls to the Wall, keeping my fingers crossed for that). Matthew Vaughn was definitely the guy I'd go for, that was the first reason why I wanted to go watch the flick.<br/><br/>Actually, there were a couple of more reasons why I wanted to see this movie real bad.<br/><br/>James McAvoy, reason no.2, with awesome movies like Wanted and Atonement to his name, 'him in the boots of Charles' - I was a bit inquisitive.<br/><br/>Reason no. 3 - Magneto, My favourite character in the X-men saga (with Cyclops sharing the same position in the list) I was not sure whether Michael Fassbender was the right person for it(But you know what? He was impeccable as Erik.) <br/><br/>Reason no. 4 - The awesome trailer and the trailer's music. I couldn't help humming the music every now and then.<br/><br/>Reason no. 5 - Kurt's(Nightcrawler's) father Azazel, I was looking forward for this guy because Marvel Comics had manifested him as one of the most powerful mutant(tel-e-porting in a different dimension even in the Mutant Chronicles is no joke, Right?) Although they modify the story every now and then (Geez !!! what about the part where Mystique falls in love with Azazel in Germany and conceives Nightcrawler?)<br/><br/>Reason no. 6 - The Oscar nominated actress Jennifer Lawrence(for Winter's Bone) had bagged the role for Raven? ""CURIOUS""...........!!!<br/><br/>Reason no. 7 - Rose Byrne, I am watching her movies ever since I saw her in Troy and Wicker Park. Was looking forward to watch her as the famous Moira MacTaggert.<br/><br/>Reason no. 8 - Kevin Bacon, Although the trailer 'hardly' showed him hither and thither, I was looking forward for his role as Shaw and guess what he proved to be the finest of all! Reason no. 8 - A big fan of Marvel Comics and the X-men saga. So no questions there.<br/><br/>Some great acting by the entire crew with the HellFire Club's lead Kevin Bacon as Shaw, Riptide(he never spoke, dumb-ass! What up), Jason Flemyng as Azazel(now that's called skillful), January Jones as Emma Frost and of course the X team as well with Nicholas Hoult as Beast, James McAvoy as Charles, Fassbender as Magneto, Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique etc. The movie was kick-ass and worth watching. The screenplay was brilliant. Vaughn, no words to express his direction and Kevin Bacon along with Michael Fassbender and James McAvoy stole the show."
"NJRocker091188","10","7","11","14 June 2011"," Makes For A Great Movie/ Comic Movie/ Summer Flick.
","First,I'd just like to say for those of you whom hated this film,there is something you need to keep in mind.And that is, that this film isn't just a prequel.It is also in a way a reboot. It is as if we are forgetting the disappointment of X3, as if it didn't happen. It is like the only movies that came out where X-Men and X2.<br/><br/>If you where to actually pay attention, and look back, you would note that this movie starts of just as the first one did. Clearly indicating, that the director, as well as writers made this film in a way to be a remake. Therefore, this is not just a prequel, it is a reboot.<br/><br/>And obviously, with Professor X ending up wheelchair bond at the end, it also shows that we are in fact starting over.<br/><br/>A side from that, this film is in fact excellent.<br/><br/>I cannot say that this film is not at all flawed. But, at the same time, I do not see a reason to not declare it as excellent.<br/><br/>With excellent performances from James McAvoy, and Michael Fassbender. As well as a great script, and store line. I am not trying to state that the rest of the cast did not give a excellent performance, but James and Micheal where truly excellent.<br/><br/>Other then performance from the actors/ and actresses, and the nicely written script/ story line, there are other things that I liked about this movie. I liked how as the viewer, I finally got to see Professor X and what he is like just as Charles Xavier. You get to see him as more then just a mutant with mind powers. We get to explore a little bit of what he is like as a young man in his 20's. You also get to see him as he shows off his mind power. It was also talked about in the first two films, but never really shown.<br/><br/>And then there is Erik Lehnsherr / Magneto . We get to understand a little bit more about his past, and why he became the villain that we know him as. Exploring his past as Erik, and seeing him and his power develop.<br/><br/>The next person we get to learn a little bit about is Raven / Mystique. In stead of just seeing her as a blue bad ass, you actually get to learn about her as Raven. We get to see both her sides. I also knew there was a lot more to her then just being a bitch, but, it was never really told. And, we get to learn about her relationship with Erik.<br/><br/>Now, I am not going to get into detail about ever character. But, the point is, if you never read the comics, or you did, but didn't read them all. Either way, you get to learn a little bit about some of your favorite characters. This film unlocks some information that wasn't giving to us before in previous films.<br/><br/>And another thing about this film that I really liked was that he got to see Professor X as a teacher. It was talked about how he was a great teacher but, again, it was never really explored. So, in this film, you actually get into some detail.<br/><br/>And last but, not least, I really liked the whole war setting. I thought that made for a great plot line.<br/><br/>So, as the viewer, you get some great special effects, some excellent performances, a excellent script/story, a long with some detail about some favorites, and there past, as well as relationship with each other. And of course, a excellent plot.<br/><br/>X-Men: First Class makes for a down right great film, excellent comic book movie, and a excellent summer flick."
"malcoms-flicks","10","7","11","6 June 2011"," Another great installment. But where to rank it!?
","I almost want to say 'hands down, best X-Men movie thus far' but I just cant decide. First class did have it all. The writing was pretty clever, the way they wrote the main story around the Cuban missile crisis. The actors portrayed every character flawlessly. There were beautiful women; beautiful men for that matter, and plenty of action and momentum to keep you pumped throughout the film. Even a cameo that made a few hairs stand up, from sheer BAD- ASS. <br/><br/>We are inducting this movie into the franchise; and with honor I'd say. Its not a reboot or a sequel or even a prequel. Just another story line in the creative world of X-MEN. We started with the first 3 films followed by the epic spin off 'Origins: Wolverine' and now we get to witness how it all started with 'First Class'. These first four films success are greatly thanks to Wolverine. Played by, in every film, Hugh Jackman. Geniusly I am definitely gonna add. I think we can all agree, for sure, that Jackman cannot be out played for the role of everyones favorite X man. Not just the almost freakish way he physically looks like the character but the way he becomes Wolverine is what really takes you away. This is where the conflict comes in as far as where to rank the new installment, critically. Taking the franchise in a new direction, first class introduces characters not as popular as Wolverine. An X-Men movie without him!? This may be a disappointment to movie goers. Despite these new characters, you most definitely will not be disappointed.<br/><br/>First off, I have to say excellent job to Michael Fassbender playing Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto. Right away, his performance makes the absence of wolverine extraneous and makes way for a character even more powerful and just as conflicted. Fassbender Plays magneto brilliantly as well. Before this film, Magneto was arguably, the top super villain created. Post film, I will say with confidence ""thee number one"" super villain. As its told in this film, Erik Lehnsherr is a Jewish German whose family is taken to concentration camps in 1944 Nazi Germany. But is emancipated by Sebastian Shaw played; wonderfully evil by Kevin Bacon, to be an apprentice slash lab rat. As Lehnsherr grows up, he is fueled by hate for what had happened to him and his family and sets out for revenge. He advances his powers with rage and anger, becoming an extremely powerful and deadly weapon. Within his campaign he meets a man named Charles Xavier, played by James McAvoy. Who for the first time in his life, gives Lehnsherr some sort of vision and feelings besides his tunneled focus for revenge charged by hate.<br/><br/>McAvoy brings into being, a Professor X with a bit more spice then I would have expected, compared to his older self played perfectly by Patrick Stewart in the first three installments. Despite his early mild frat boy style we still see Xavier compose the authentic trait of compassion we all know to be Charles Xavier. It was a nice surprise to see a young, newly deemed professor, with other things on his mind, like girls and having fun rather then his life devoted focus for helping mutants and man kind alike. As we see the professor start to develop that life long devotion, James gives us a benevolent, yet thrilling ride into those big shoes Xavier will have to fill to become Professor X.<br/><br/>With a mutual compassion for the discovery of new mutants, Together Erik and Xavior become a team, finding and offering mutants a chance for something great. We get to see mutants like Havok, and Beast played by Lucas Till and Nicholas Hoult and other familiars like the young Mystique played by Jennifer Lawrence. These young group of kids struggle to harness and control their great gifts, with the first of many lessons taught by Professor X. With common enemies, the team helps agent Moira MacTaggert, played by Rose Byrne, and the CIA find the extremely dangerous Sebastian Shaw. A mutant powerful enough to turn humans against each other using nuclear war, with the intention of the extinction of homo sapien and the rise of mutants. <br/><br/>This is an epic adaptation and one of many possible story lines in the X-Men universe. Its a story of coming of age and fulfilling your responsibility for who you are meant to be. A tale of a two sided coin where on one side a man raised by hate and fear believes our species to be an ignorant race and will only fear what they do not understand. Which will lead to a violent vindication towards mutants, and a war to the death. While on the other side, another man believes that even though this may be true, there is good in everyone and this war will be fought to educate the world to result in peace and unity. No matter the side, war is inevitable and both sides will fight for their beliefs, at all costs. <br/><br/>As a Marvel fan boy, keep um coming! There are so many characters and so many ways Marvel studios can take them. Maybe there are some things that didn't exactly happen in the very first comic book. Or maybe the time line is a bit off here or there. So what, these stories are wonderful cinematic adventures! We can rate these movies all day, and each film will see every spot on the rank line, but no doubt, each one are incredibly entertaining and totally fun to watch. If you're like me and these Marvel films bring you back to when you were Wolverine fighting Magneto on the playground at lunch, or if you have never even heard of the X-men you will enjoy them all. As far as rank goes 'Hands down best X-Men movie thus far' Why don't you guys see it, and let me know."
"froebusiness","2","35","76","4 June 2011"," This movie is horrible
","OK, where do I start? It's hard to imagine that there is an X-Men movie out there that is actually worse than Wolverine Origins, but it exists. Guess which one it is! X-Men: First Class starts off with some promise and then fails so miserably to deliver that I tried to get refunded on my snacks that I bought since they were ingested while I was watching this terrible excuse for a movie. I soon remembered that they were purchased at Stop and Shop, however, and was not able to do so. I don't know what the hell is going on, but for some reason critics are calling this an entertaining summer movie. I think these ""critics"" are either hammered, payed off, or inept. <br/><br/>To me, an entertaining movie is one that leaves the viewer with some form of contentment after it ends; characters develop, plots and subplots merge, and there is a cohesive quality to the thing that makes it one whole film and not just a bunch of scenes thrown together in a somewhat logical manner. X-Men: First Class felt like the latter. The acting is sub-par, and the emotions are forced and laughable. Beast looks dumb as hell, and none of the new mutants have any pizazz. <br/><br/>The biggest problem this movie has is its severe lack of faith in its audience. For example: when Professor X does telekinetic shenanigans, the camera shoots from his head into another person's head just so that the viewer knows that he is now in that person's head. I mean, that's movie magic people. Come on, you don't have to make a POV mind bullet to let us know what's going on, and you don't need to do a slow zoom in on a character for 3 full seconds to hint at a possible love interest (Mystique).<br/><br/>I'm rambling here, but I don't feel like planning out an essay for this review because this movie doesn't deserve it. I'm not sure what's going on in the world because people seem to be mutually accepting of this horrible movie, but please, for the love of God, don't waste your money on this wanna be reboot; it is not worth it. However, if you want to see a bunch of semi-talented actors talk way too much, fight way too little, and clumsily make their way through a terrible re-imagining of the Cuban Missile crisis, be my guest. Hey, you're probably dumb, so you may like it."

","Matthew Vaughn started to shine as a new star on Hollywood's dimly lit sky with Kick Ass. So I was keen on watching this new X-Men prequel, but sadly it was everything what Kick Ass was not. The worst casting ever made for a superhero movie. Imagine Mystique as a fat faced youngster, or Toad in a red costume, looking like a B movie action hero.<br/><br/>Poorly written dialogues, 15 year old Visual Effects reminding me of a low budget movie, nonexistent action sequences and a meaningless story makes this a painful experience, you never want to experience again in your life. This is the absolute low end of the X-Men franchise."
"erick_151","1","23","48","30 June 2011"," No Climax! All Hype! Biggest let-down ever!
","This movie, which is my first to review, was the biggest cinematic let of all time! We have all seen previews that make us think a movie will be something it is not, but that's not even the problem here.<br/><br/>The problem lies in the ultimate buildup, which was quite good, with no climax. The movie pitters out midway through and never recovers, in fact it gets worse. It actually feels like they ran out of time and money and were writing the story as it goes. The confrontations are lame and forced.<br/><br/>In summary, the first 30 minutes were an 8.8/10. After that the next 20 are about a 6.5 and the final hour is a slow decay from there down to 0 and then negative. You know it's bad when you are in California and nobody even claps at the end of the movie. The fact that this is on the top 250 movie list is insulting to all movies ever made.<br/><br/>Final thought: All of the previous X-men movies were better than this junk. I think that people are either paid or film staff is encouraged to write positive reviews when in fact, the movie sucks. That is the only way this has a positive rating."

","In a world where mutants lived camouflaged among humans, Charles Xavier, a mutant who can read minds, starts recruiting in preparation for an imminent battle with a malicious group who is determined to start World War 3. This movie presents the beginnings of the X-Men, how each of them began to use their powers, their struggle to accommodate with humans and the battle that separates them into two distant factions.<br/><br/>It manages to tell its story in an entertaining and thrilling way alongside all the awesomeness generated by the mutants and their powers. It's unexpectedly captivating and the fact that it leaves almost no question unanswered regarding the origins of the mutants makes it even more interesting. I have to admit that one or two aspects of the ""young ones"" are a bit exaggerated and awkward but that doesn't affect the overall quality of the film. It was a pleasant surprise from this franchise and I can only hope they will maintain this level in the upcoming titles."
"ThomasDrufke","9","2","2","3 March 2017"," Mutant & Proud
","There are a lot of great things about First Class, but I think the one that sticks out to me the most (even after years and tons of viewings) is that it works as both a reboot and prequel. Even though the continuity has since been mingled with even more, this film did such a great job of resetting the universe without tarnishing what came before.<br/><br/>In large part, the strengths of the film lie with Matthew Vaughn's direction. Up to this point, I liked most of the X-Men films, but even the people who have loved the series would say that there wasn't much ""fun"" to be had. The original X-Men trilogy took itself very seriously and rightfully so. But there's something to be said for a mutant story that poses similar thought provoking questions and themes like before, while also making a fun adventure out of it. Vaughn does a wonderful job balancing the two.<br/><br/>Setting an X-Men film in the 1960's meant having to recast all of the recurring characters. Luckily, casting was something 20th Century Fox had no problem with. I don't think we could have dreamed of a better pairing to take over the roles of Professor X and Magneto than James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender. Perhaps, some would say that the two of them have outdone their counterparts, Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan (I, myself being one of those people). Much like the film itself, McAvoy and Fassbender put their own spin on the characters, but bring enough similarity in their performance to understand the connective tissue between the pairs.<br/><br/>Something the new trilogy of X-Men films does incredibly well is use the decade the films are set in to enhance the overall story they were going for. First Class is set in the 60's, and uses the Cuban Missile Crisis as the film's climatic sequence. But it uses it in a way that doesn't exploit that event, instead, gives a reason for there to be tension between Charles & Erik. This film and Days of Future Past nail the relationship between those two more so than any X-Men film to date.<br/><br/>Going back to the fun stuff though, the rest of the mutants are made up of mostly throw away heroes and villains. No one was really asking for characters like Azazel, Riptide, Angel Salvadore, Havoc, Darwin, Banshee, or even more Mystique. But even as much as these characters could have felt like throwaway characters, Vaughn managed to build them into the story in a creative way. Everyone has their own arc and moment to shine. In fact, my favorite part of the film involves Charles & Erik recruiting, and subsequently training everyone. It's classic superhero stuff.<br/><br/>Overall, First Class makes good with its new cast and setting. Matthew Vaughn transitioned what was originally planned as a Magneto origin story into a wonderfully balanced comic-book adaptation. One that nails the characters motivations and mindsets in a refreshing but respectful and realistic way. <br/><br/>+Charles & Erik<br/><br/>+Recruiting & Training<br/><br/>+Score<br/><br/>+Vaughn's directing<br/><br/>+Setting adds to the story<br/><br/>9.4/10"

","Narrating the origin story of the many significant characters in the X-Men universe & set in the 1960s during the Cuban missile crisis which put the entire world on the verge of a nuclear Armageddon, X- Men: First Class mainly concerns the close friendship between Charles Xavier & Erik Lehnsherr before they turned into archenemies and adopted the names of Professor X & Magneto, respectively.<br/><br/>Director Matthew Vaughn brings an entirely fresh approach & style in almost all filmmaking departments here and succeeds in balancing its quality action with impressive storytelling without ever letting down the entertainment factor. Tightly edited from start to finish, the film looks absolutely fantastic, thanks to its vibrant cinematography, state-of-the-art visual effects & sensational score.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, the entire cast is pretty well-rounded & each member is pretty convincing in their given roles. James McAvoy plays Charles Xavier aka Professor X while Michael Fassbender is in as Erik Lehnsherr aka Magneto, and the performance as well as chemistry between these two is what makes this film work so wonderfully along with the fine input coming from the rest of its supporting cast.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, benefiting greatly from its brilliant direction, strong script, magnetic performances from McAvoy & Fassbender, terrific visual effects, tight editing & a marvelous score, X-Men: First Class comes out as a highly potent package that guarantees a cinematic experience which is surely going to entertain & astonish its viewers in more ways than one."

","I avoided this for years s. Thinking it was going to be naff. But no. It's great fun!! It's got a cool 60s bond vibe. Fassbender is going all out bond in this. Jennifer Lawrence is adorable! Emma Frost is like a later day Farrah Fawcett It's measured. It's well paced. It's cool. It's sexy It's almost as good as the first X Men film. It just lacks good old Wolverine. But the performances here are great. If like me, you had your doubts, forget them. Sit back and enjoy this. We need more 60s themed super hero movies lol.I'm looking forward to watching the sequel already. It's reaffirmed my love of X-Men films. After the Wolverine movies ruined them a bit."
"undeadfearz","8","2","2","28 May 2016"," The best X-Men film
","You're probably thinking that my opinion of this film being the best X-Men film is totally wrong - but hold on. Many people simply dismissed this movie, because there is no Wolverine (not completely) or Ian Mckellen or Patrick Stewart, and it is another origin story we didn't need. they could not have been more wrong. <br/><br/>First Class is a stylish, fun and downright emotional film. The actors have been perfectly cast, with the highlight being Michael Fassbender as Magneto/Erik Lensher. As usual, Fassbender makes you connect with him on an emotional level, and we get to see his story arch evolve as he goes from scared child, to revenge seeking bad ass, to a slightly wiser mutant, who resembles the Magneto of the original trilogy. <br/><br/>Alongside him is James McCavoy as Professor Xavier, another great piece of casting here, who brings a witty charm and charisma we'd never expect to see from Charles, as well as the serious tone and eloquence that have received from Patrick Stewart. Both younger alterations of Magneto and Xavier are different from the originals, but we see them start on the path towards their older selves. Whilst there was sometime spent on building their friendship, I only wish there had been more, and the impact the end of the movie has on Charles (in Days of Future Past) feels slightly overwhelming, as the relationship between the two could've been stretched out further. <br/><br/>The rest of the cast are great, with Jennifer Lawrence as a young mystique/raven, not yet set on her path of wrong doing, as well as Nicolas Hoult as Beast/Hank. The script is bolstered by the backdrop of 1963, and the Cuban missile crisis, which adds a sense of realism to the movie - which can be difficult when there are people with devil tails and others who can catch the explosion of a grenade. <br/><br/>The movie also does the comic due respect, finally introducing the classic yellow uniforms, steering away from the Blade style black leather, and the movie has a uniquely retro feel to it. <br/><br/>The majority of the emotional scenes revolve around Magneto, as the movie attempts to humanise the yet-to-be villain. The standout involves a scene where Xavier helps Magneto boost his powers - it is truly emotional and makes your hairs stand on edge, further bolstered by the acting talents of McCavoy and Fassbender. <br/><br/>Other good points are that the special effects are good, the action if creative and always fun to watch, and the music is a respectable score for such a good film. Whilst there are many references to the previous X-Men films, I don't feel that you need to have watched any of the others to appreciate First Class, although it might help when it comes to a certain hilarious cameo. <br/><br/>Nick Paul"
"mattmaclean","3","13","25","13 August 2011"," Very bad.
","I have to say I made this account simply for reviewing this tile. I was shock to see that it had an 8/10 on this site. I can certainly see how the movie could be entertaining, but good? No. For me this ruined much of the mystery of Charles and Erik's relationship.<br/><br/>So these two 'friends' only knew each other for a couple days/weeks before they became enemies. I got the impression their relationship was much more extensive than this.<br/><br/>I enjoyed all the other x-men movies, the first being my favourite. I am not a huge x-men fan, I really only know the movies so I have no idea if they match up with the original works, but I can say for certain that first class doesn't match up with the first three films at all. This thing had more gaping plot holes then a shotgun wound. And if it wasn't supposed to connected to the other films why was there a Wolverine cameo?<br/><br/>The breakdown:<br/><br/>Acting: Decent, but nothing spectacular. I found the scenes where Charles helps the other mutants with training extremely hard to stomach.<br/><br/>Plot: The idea of this was something I had interest in. Seeing how it began, but after seeing the first preview I was thinking it looked very bad. But I was disappointed because it turned out to be much worse. It seems like a bad attempt to quickly show the history between Erik and Charles. And again, so many plot holes with regard to the other films.<br/><br/>CGI/special effects: I thought they were done well. Though beasts face was horrible, I love the way they did it in last stand.<br/><br/>Action: I felt myself yawning during these parts. I didn't really enjoy a single action sequence in the whole film.<br/><br/>Casting: Not bad actors, but I felt no one was really into it.<br/><br/>Final thoughts: Basically watching this movie and then thinking about it made me a little angry. If you like superhero movie you'll probably see this no matter what I say, I suppose I would too."

Magneto for once never had his powers as a child, he developed them later on on his adulthood on account of disease. Xavier was not crippled by a stupid ricochet but by the physical consequences of an astral battle with the King of shadows. Havok, now there's a kicker... him appearing way before his brother Alex. Are you serious!? And again with the diamond form of Emma Frost... Sebastian Shaw the absolute bad guy!? well played there, but he was for a long time an underling of Magneto, and does not die from a ""coin disorder"" -.-' he's immortal (yes one of the X-Eternals like Sam Guthrie)!!!<br/><br/>And Xavier and Mystique's brotherly love!? really!?<br/><br/>Please stop ruining these characters... how does Stan Lee uphold this is beyond my capability of understanding...

","""I will count to three and you will move this coin.""<br/><br/>This is yet another entry in an apparently never ending line of sequels-prequels-shmequels Hollywood keeps turning out, these days. The script sucks, the director is utterly incompetent, the main actors are miscast, the secondary actors are wasted. The entire movie is made of plastic (poster included).<br/><br/>The script is a joke. It was written by committee and not even a good one. None of the writers have any major works to their credit and to make maters worse - as if that was even possible - the story is written by none other than Bryan Singer: the guy who ruined every super hero movie he ever touched.<br/><br/>The entire movie is nothing more that one huge introduction. Introduce super hero (sorry, mutant) number one. Check. Introduce mutant number 2. Check. Introduce mutant number 3. Check. And so on and so forth. Should they do anything interesting? Anything at all? No, no, no. God forbid they'd do something exciting.<br/><br/>Dear writers, this is a prequel, we get it. You have to introduce people, we understand that. But by Golly, why did you have to make them so excruciatingly boring? Couldn't you find them something interesting to do? Anything?<br/><br/>The director of this movie is one incompetent bastard. There is nothing that says: ""Hey, that was interesting."" Nothing. This is just one big music video clip, but without the music. The sets are very similar with the ones in Superman Returns: big, expensive and unrealistic. And dead. There is nothing that says: ""We live here"". No. There should be a big sign on the door saying: ""Vacancy. Rooms to rent. Butlers to hire. Everybody's gone fishing. Big discounts!"" (and in smaller letters) ""The place stinks!""<br/><br/>The actors are terribly miscast and/or underused. James McAvoy is completely miscast as Professor Xavier, he doesn't look anything like the comics character or like Sir Patrick Stewart, for that matter. Plus his only ability seems to be touching his head with his fingers: ""I'm gonna put my fingers to my head and I'm gonna smack your arse"", he seems to say. Plus he is given the stupidest lines ever: "" Remember, true concentration lies between rage and serenity."" No kidding! Really??<br/><br/>Michael Fassbender seems a little more adequate, but nothing about him says: ""Look at me, I'm Magneto"". And to make maters worse, he is not spared the idiotic writing either. I mean, the Nazi doctor kills his mother and the poor kid goes on a rampage killing everybody, but he doesn't kill the guy who did it? Really? What the heck! This is joke, right?<br/><br/>Everybody else is wasted in this movie. Oliver Platt and Michael Ironside have a few lines, and Ray Wise is on the screen for about 2 seconds.<br/><br/>X-Men: First Class. More like third or fourth class, if you ask me. 2/10."
"preppy-3","4","13","26","11 June 2011"," At its best is was OK
","A rebooting of the X-Men. It gives us the origin of Dr. X (James McAvoy) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender). They are no longer brothers--Dr. X is a brilliant scientist and Magneto saw his mother brutally killed in a German concentration camp. Most of this takes place in 1962 during the Cuban Missile Crisis (so we can have a younger--and hotter--cast). Sebastian Stan (Kevin Bacon) is an evil mutant who (with some followers) wants to start a world wide apocalypse. Dr. X and his band of good mutants set out to stop him.<br/><br/>The special effects are top notch and this movie clearly was made on a BIG budget with incredible locations and such...but I was bored. The script is VERY slow and the constant ""winks"" at the audience (dialogue that clearly shows future events) gets tiresome. The evil mutants are never introduced by name (except for Emma Frost) and their powers are never explained leading to confusion (in the audience). Add to that is the totally unnecessary length (this film could have wrapped up in less than 2 hours), plot holes all over the place and historical inaccuracies galore. Even worse some of the acting is terrible--Lucas Till is dreadful as Havoc and McAvoy is bad too. Even worse is Bacon! To top it all off the one black mutant is killed off early on! I thought that kind of scripting went out in the 1960s! It struck me as ridiculously racist. On the good side--Fassbender is GREAT as Magneto and January Jones is terrific as Emma Frost (although she is captured far too easily--and never even attempts to escape). A cameo by Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) is hysterical and easily the best part of the movie! The use of multiple screens during the training sessions were nice too. But, all in all, I found this boring and pointless. I was looking at my watch more than the screen! A 4 all the way."
"pauli10","4","7","12","29 April 2012"," X-Men and An Extra Slice of Cheese
","This is not a good film but let's start with the plot. Set during the Cold War, a mutant named Shaw (that rhymed :) ) is attempting to start a nuclear war between America and Russia in order to wipe out all humans and leave the remaining mutants to live amongst the cockroaches. I'm not entirely sure how Shaw expects the mutants to eat, drink and live on an ashen bum hole of a planet but I digress. Cue the X-Men and perhaps one of the cheesiest films to ever get a high grade on IMDb.<br/><br/>The dialogue is, in a word, cheesy. With actors doing the best with what they have, for the most part. Michael Fassbender's fantastic interpretation of an Irish Magneto really is distracting as you try to work out at what point the German Jew picked up his Gaelic lilt. It's okay though as Fassbender lets it go from time to time just to play with our minds.<br/><br/>As mutants go there is a decent array of unique mutants that at least makes a change from the three films that preceded it. Though I felt some were a little weak and, well, looked a little silly. Banshee in particular seemed able to crack glass but in a fight situation relied on flying away from danger. Look out for the first time Banshee learns to fly and the appalling CGI employed. On the whole they all felt a little weak with the exception of Beast and Havoc. Even here, these mutants feel under used. Accepting that they are merely learning their powers and very young I expected them to be used more, for fighting yes, or learning about their characters, the film does neither.<br/><br/>There is little in the way of character depth here with only Magneto really been a fully realised character. I don't think the actors can be blamed here. Without spoiling anything, look out for Mystique/Raven's fantastic heart wrenching (sarcasm) scene when she must decide between A MAN SHE HAS SPENT HER ENTIRE LIFE WITH AND WHO COULD BE DYING and another guy who just tried to kill everyone.<br/><br/>The film also contains a training montage...need I say more? With a plot that makes you go, ""He's planning what..?"", dialogue that makes you cringe and underutilized mutants, X-men first class is disappointing."
"robert-kaleta","Null","7","12","17 July 2011"," Ruined potential...
","As I am a huge X-Men fan, having read the comics and watched the animated series many, many, many times, I eagerly waited for the ""First Class"". I hoped the writers would stick to the comic story-line, as they mostly did in previous movies. But after couple of minutes, I was already thinking - ""This can't be good"". <br/><br/>First, Xavier's and Mystique's friendship - where that come from? I think it was done purposely, so Mystique could be in the movie at all - joining Magneto at the end and making legitimate ground for her character. Than there's the scene, when Magneto's mother is killed - why on Earth Erik didn't kill Shaw then, instead of crushing tables and cabinets? And most of all - team. Havok and Banshee were OK, but the girl with wings who looked more like Wasp from Avengers? What happened to Bobby Drake or Warren Worthington? Oh, I now what. ""We have shown Iceman as a teenager in X-Men (1), so he can't possibly be alive in 1960's"". That's the biggest plot hole in the whole X-Men film universe - by messing around with characters age (not mentioning lack of characteristic Scottish accent of Moira MacTaggart), it caused weird time continuum where some heroes are already mature and battle-ready, and some are never mentioned (Cyclops, Jean). <br/><br/>Adding to that, some things weren't explained in the film at all, like: who's Emma Frost? What is she doing with Shaw? What's a Hellfire Club? Who the heck are these guys helping Shaw? And why? And there's plenty of more such things. <br/><br/>On the positive side I have to say that fight scenes are pretty damn good - quick and well made. So as for actors - they are quite good at portraying comic book heroes and villains; and brief Wolverine cameo was worth every second of it :) As for the plot, my feelings are that it was a tool to establish a starting point for a future exploitation, and not a material for the movie itself. The whole movie looked like it's only goal was to make Professor X handicapped, Magneto an evil mutant and Mystique his accomplice. The Cuban crisis idea was neat, but because of all that, it served only as a battlefield for good and bad guys. <br/><br/>Summing it up, I have to say, that it was a good movie if you just want to watch some nice special effects sequences, but for a real X-Men fan, this film's story is too much stretched form the original to give a eyes feast."
"toqtaqiya2","8","7","12","12 July 2011"," X-Men: First Class is a must-see superhero film.
","X-Men: First Class is a good summer blockbuster. Director Matthew Vaughn (Kick-Ass) crafted an engaging and entertaining film that, in the X-Men film series, is bettered only by X2 (2003). It acts as a prequel/reboot covering the origins of the X-Men in an alternate history where the powerful mutant Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) attempts to ignite a nuclear war between the USA and the USSR. Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender) are signed up by US intelligence to foil Shaw's plans, and in the process they become good friends. The CGI is not perfect, but it's put to very good use. The story is solid (helped by the good script) with doses of effective humor throughout. Strongest in the film is the characterization. There are several notable performances. Bacon, McAvoy and especially Fassbender are in excellent form. The supporting cast is fine too (Nicholas Hoult, Zoe Kravitz, Jennifer Lawrence being the standouts). Better superhero films have been made, but First Class is definitely a WOW movie. It's a good example of what summer movies should be like. I recommend seeing it."

It goes very deep and reveals the back stories of even the more mysterious characters. I was hooked about five minutes in. This is perhaps the best superhero movie I have ever seen. The acting was sensational. I especially liked Michael Fassbender as Eric/Magneto. He really made his character believable. I'm anxious to see more of his work. And I didn't just like the acting, but I liked the character as well. It was interesting to watch him develop and change throughout the movie. Kevin Bacon also did a fantastic job portraying Sebastian Shaw, the villain who, as it happens, was responsible for the Cuban Missile Crisis and the almost start of World War 3. Better add that one to the history books:p -Funny thing, I didn't recognize him as Kevin Bacon until the end of the movie.

","Holy cow, what a movie. Nerd Alert! Michael Fassbender and James McAvoy are superb. Each one by themselves would have made the movie terrific,when sharing the screen? Unbelievable! From to start to finish, incredible.<br/><br/>Kevin Bacon has never done better,Jennifer Lawrence is awesome, Rose Byrne and January Jones don't have much importance, Ray Wise and Michael Ironside were dispensable, but all in all the cast was spectacular.<br/><br/>The story is really well written. Kevin Bacon has a plan. Against him, the goodies work together. Their reasons different, but more or less all they want is him stopped. <br/><br/>Charles and Erik are interesting characters. They argue. And we can argue forever about them, and about who is right.<br/><br/>As you watch you desperately wish they could stay friends, but you know why they ultimately can't. Even if they themselves, in these early days, don't know it yet. To have that so perfectly captured in a<br/><br/>movie is part of what makes this a treat and a future classic. Aside from their relationship to each other, the movie takes time to make each of them interesting in their own right. We see Charles as a teacher, and come to understand how he impacts upon the lives of those he teaches. Some of Erik's best moments are in his comments to Mystique about her appearance, making it clear that this man has more to him than his past. <br/><br/>One scene where most of the supporting characters are clearly scared will certainly make you care about them for the rest of the movie. Unfortunately Sebastian Shaw's henchmen don't get anything to do except use their powers, and at the end of the story we know as much about January Jones as we did at the beginning.<br/><br/>The FX are crazy good,using actual sets/costumes was a good idea. There are action scenes throughout the movie, the movie grows as it continues. The first part is more story so that when the action starts you care about the characters. Deaths, back-stabbings,awesome cameos and name dropping ensues. <br/><br/>Awesome movie, really cool script and two incredible lead performances.<br/><br/>I really hope they continue to build from this story. 9/10 One of the best movies in a long long time."
"Mhea","4","6","10","11 November 2011"," one of the most disappointing films of the decade
","I actually registered to IMDb now, just to let people know how bad a movie this is. As I am a big fan of X-men and quite liked the previous movies (although the third one not as much as the first two, and completely excluding wolverine origins), I was eagerly awaiting this prequel. I was seriously disappointed.<br/><br/>First of all, the plot is slow, boring, and weak. It doesn't even make sense if you have watched the other three. As some other reviewers have mentioned, there is a scene in the third movie when Charles and Erik visit the young Jean. People have mentioned that Charles is walking when, according to this new movie, he should be in a wheelchair. however, have no one thought about the fact that Charles and Erik are still friends? Why else would they go together? Furthermore, since when were Charles and Raven step-siblings? I think she should have been excluded from the movie altogether. I love the character of Raven/Mystique in the previous movies, but she doesn't fit into the plot of this one. They have many other interesting characters (although poorly developed) that they could have explored instead. Some of the characters included, were just silly. Why would they possibly want Darwin-guy and butterfly-girl for a team of highly trained fighters? Surely there are better powers to think of. I also know that all powers in x-men requires a stretch of your sense of logic, but as a zoologist I must say that there is no way she would be able to fly with those wings. Give me Angel any day!<br/><br/>Second of all, the plot is so extremely slow, boring, and weak. Should it even be referred to as action if you are struggling to keep awake? It seems as though there is now an action recipe that you have to follow in Hollywood. The problem with that is that it makes it boring and predictable. Also, has no one else noticed that it is basically the same story as the first movie (remember when Magneto uses Rogue to channel a weapon that will mutate the heads of state attending a world summit), with a bit of the third? They seem to think that if they take the plots of a couple of other movies, mix them together, and place them in a different decade, no one will notice.<br/><br/>Third, the cast was weak. McAvoy and Fassbender, I believe, do the best with what they were given in terms of plot and script. January Jones has never managed to impress me with her acting, and yet again she failed to do so. She would be better acting out a statue! I will only give one comment on Jennifer Lawrence, and that is that it is tough to play a character that is so well liked and has been expressed so beautifully by Rebecca Romijn. Kevin Bacon.... no words can begin to describe the horrible mess he made out of the villain. Maybe it was the plot, maybe the script, but you would think that an actor with that many years in the trade would be able to add more dimensions to a character, or even play that one dimension well. Magneto as a villain works so well because there are so many aspects of his personality. Shaw was a caricature of a villain, completely one-sided and uninteresting. <br/><br/>The last thing that I will comment on, because writing down everything that bothered me about this film would result in an essay, is the cgi and makeup. Why is the cgi worse in this movie (2011) than in X-men (2000)? Are we suddenly moving backwards in time in technological advancement? Raven's transformations into mystique were bad. The battle-scenes were bad. The execution of the ""powers"" were bad. As for Beast, they should have stuck to the makeup they used on Kelsey Grammar. His lips didn't even move when he was talking, making the close-ups of him cringe-worthy to watch. <br/><br/>I'm going to stop there, although there are many more things that needs to be said. Watch it if you are in bed with the flu and bored to death already. If you can find better things to do, don't watch it!"
"krachtm","5","6","10","8 September 2011"," A breezy popcorn movie for kids.
","I'm perfectly willing to accept that certain characters and plot points must change when you adapt from one media to another, especially when you're talking about a two hour action movie aimed at kids. However, the liberties taken with the characters in this movie are simply too much for me to wrap my head around. Sebastian Shaw is a WWII Nazi war criminal? In the comics, he's an amoral, American businessman who joins a secret society, kills all the leaders, and usurps control. That's a pretty scary guy. Does he really have to become an over-the-top Josef Mengele stand-in? Charles Xavier and Mystique are now step-siblings? OK, I'm willing to accept Shaw as a Nazi war criminal if I must, but this is just bizarre. Most of the characters have their nationalities switched around for no apparent reason. Furthermore, their ages are all messed up, with Havok (Cyclops' younger brother) being particularly paradoxical, now that he's old enough to be his elder brother's father. Seriously, I can forgive a lot of stuff, but this is just sloppy beyond belief.<br/><br/>OK, so the continuity is all messed up, the characters and their interactions are completely revamped, and this is apparently meant to be a reboot, not a prequel. How is the actual movie, once you get beyond the issues regarding the source material and continuity? Well, I'd like to say it gets substantially better, but there are several really annoying aspects to it. First of all, there's a token black guy who's introduced and then almost instantly killed off. Seriously? I can't believe that we're still doing that in 2011. Emma Frost, the White Queen, was never one of my favorite characters. I always felt that she was one of the worst examples of the objectification of women in comic books, and she's played completely straight in this movie. Her stripperific costumes are toned down quite a bit, however. The X-Men, after weathering an attack by Shaw and his associates, go through an intense week of training, where they each suddenly have individual epiphanies and become self-confident bad asses, getting beyond whatever psychological issue was holding them back. Ugh. It reminded me of a horrible 80s movie, but, luckily, we were spared the training montage set to Eye of the Tiger. However, what really annoyed me was the ease with which characters flip-flopped between good and evil. One simplistic speech is enough to change almost anyone's mind, it seems. Then again, this is a comic book movie for kids and young adults, so I guess you can't really expect anything deep. Action movies aren't generally known for their deeply philosophical dialogue and strongly written characters. The X-Men have never been intellectual, highbrow entertainment, but they were written better than this, and they deserve better than this."

","Forget everything you have seen in other prequels - this may well be the film of the series (Even without Wolverine). It is certainly a group effort and it is superb.<br/><br/>Every scene and every actor delivers a deeply satisfying film that perfectly prequels and expands the X Men series.<br/><br/>For this reviewer, this was easily the best film of the series so far - the script has real purpose and drive - and the action doesn't kick in too soon - we get tons of back story and character development, something of a rarity in action summer blockbusters.<br/><br/>All in all, probably will not best Transformers or Pirates at the box office, but it certainly deserves to - hugely better than expected - and a good film all over."
"gigan-92","10","6","10","4 July 2011"," Not Since X2 Have I Been So Amazed
","I honestly underestimated this movie, But I can say now I was no less than stunned. And how my doubt would have been lessened all the sooner had I known Matthew Vaughn was directing. Yes, under his direction we don't get a Brett Ratner purely action driven mainstream flick, or a Gavin Hood cliché fest. The amazing thing is that this is a prequel/reboot so the vast majority of the audiences have an idea of what's going to happen.<br/><br/>The brilliant thing is the screen play still packs quite a bit of surprises into it all. The story is highly involving and best of all the characters portrayed here are interesting and the actors playing them talented. Jennifer Lawrence is a very good Mystique, and James McAvoy I knew from the start wouldn't fail me. Michael Fassbender was perfect as a young Magneto, putting so much emotion into the villain every second of his screen time astounded me. Emma Frost is given much more screen time this time around, and is a lot better portrayed by January Jones. Beast was awesome, damn it, the characters all get their moment of awesomeness. I can't possibly go over all of them in this review without dragging it on. I can only add that Kevin Bacon was quite the antagonists and Zoë Isabella Kravitz was a very luscious Angel.<br/><br/>And the score by Henry Jackman was undeniably awesome. It has a modern feeling to it yet so packed with emotion and sharpening each moment. Definitely see this one because it takes a giant sh*t on the likes of ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" and "" X-Men Origins: Wolverine""."

","It has been a long time since I enjoyed a movie that much! If one looks at it as the reboot part of what it is and looks at it separate from the other movies it's even easier to love. The inconsistencies bothered me a little the first time I watched it, but only at the back of mind. By the time I got home I already wanted to see it again, and by the time I got back to the theater to watch it again this weekend I had decided to accept it fully for what it was and I enjoyed it even more. I had nothing else to do that day and watched two other movies I had never seen before but re-watching First Class was still the highlight of my day. On top of all that, through this movie I've discovered quite the love for James McAvoy. ;) I've spent all week finding and watching everything else he's ever been in! <br/><br/>To make a long story a little less long, they would be crazy not to make a sequel to this movie!"
"vaidya-abhishek","9","6","10","20 June 2011"," Fantastic introduction that will blow you away
","After already creating four X-Men movies making a fifth one may be considered pushing it but instead X-Men: First Class came as a fresh surprise with a new perspective. For all not new to the X-Men this movie is a nice surprise as the plot look away from the classic 'human hatred towards mutants' story to a more mature and balanced story. rather than build up from the fame of the previous X-Men it starts fresh and allows the laymen audience to better understand the X-Men world and the characters.<br/><br/>The best thing about X-Men: First Class is the fabulous manner in which the characters are introduced and developed. the audience may feel a bit lost in the beginning but the film quickly unravels. James McAvoy does a fantastic job of portraying Charles Xaviar with his casual charm and trusting voice. Michael Fassbender also provide the perfect contrast portraying Magneto as the mysterious character he is. that combined with a great cast make this movie an enjoyable and entertaining experience."

","I love superhero movies. However, very rarely do I say that they are good movies.That being said, this was a great movie.<br/><br/>There are many great things going for this movie. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender were absolutely brilliant. I was stunned at the level of acting I saw from these two considering this very rare in superhero movies. I border on saying Fassbender's performance is Oscar-worthy.I haven't seen a performance this good since Colin Firth in the King's Speech. McAvoy also gave a very impressive performance. <br/><br/>As with most comic book movies today there were liberties taken from the comic book but I excused it as it was pulled off fairly well. The plot was much more driven and on course as opposed to the previous installment which was all over the place.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence as Raven/Mystique was much better than the previous actress and she added life to the character. There really wasn't a bad acting performance seen as in the other movies.<br/><br/>The visual effects were incredible. Seeing Magneto pull the submarine out of the water was breathtaking and didn't look fake like many other movies. <br/><br/>I would say go see even if you're not a X-men fan as I was quite impressed."
"NORTHPOINTMJM","Null","6","10","14 June 2011"," The tone is breathtakingly perfect.. GREAT Film!
","After seeing this wonderful film I have to ask one question... can certain fanboys please shut up now about how this thing differs from their comic books? Apparently, a few fans couldn't leave their own expectations, cartoons and comic books at home. Too bad they assume ""they're doing it wrong"" by judging the film they see versus the one that's running in their fanboy head. Maybe that matters to a few but when the people involved deliver such an outstanding movie, does it really matter? <br/><br/>Bring on Scott, Jean and Ororo in the sequel and in Xavier's true solo ""first class."" A movie this good is guaranteed at least a few sequels. Personally, I love this movie. It rivals X2 as the best of the bunch. The tone was breathtakingly perfect. Setting it in the early 60's was brilliant. This gives the film something no one really has seen before in these type of films and certainly elevates it from the X-Trilogy. As a fan of that trilogy, it is everything I was hoping for and maybe a bit more. This is the Xavier and Magneto story everyone has wanted to see since X1 and it's done remarkably well. There's no question that this film is going to surprise the doubters and frustrate the haters. There's no way anyone could hate anything about this movie unless they went in to view it wanted to hate on it. Wonderful in every way."
"gritfrombray-1","10","6","10","13 June 2011"," Outstanding!
","I tend to approach prequels with caution. Caprica is seriously lacking as are many others. Without dragging things out, this film has a first rate cast and engaging storyline. Something I believe the other X Men films lacked. They were all good films with amazing actors, the third film being a bit weak but they were all character stuff and wafer thin story lines. This has plots, ideas and many gap fillers of Mutants' introduction into society and provides a wonderful sub plot staged around a very significant part of American history. The script, action and characters are all excellent and so many idiots are watching this on download or computer screens. Do so at your own peril as this is one for the big screen. Restored a lot of faith in Marvel movies.... Oh, and I have a whole new respect for Kevin Bacon after seeing this!!"
"kunalkhandwala","9","6","10","13 June 2011"," truly, First Class!
","X-Men: First Class is exactly what every super hero franchise should have; a back-story about the origins of protagonists that builds their moral character for future iterations. Director Michael Vaughn introduces us to young Charles Xavier, whose telepathic abilities would make him a leader of the X-Men in the future and Eric, whose tragic loss in childhood would make him harness his magnetic abilities to overpower greater forces. Their friendship that brought the First Class of mutants together, would eventually see them parting ways to either moral end. The stylized action and class we saw in Vaughn's impressive 'Kick-Ass' is replicated here in a James Bond like epic, set during the cold war with super heroes who save the day.<br/><br/>Kevin Bacon plays the doomsday villain, Sebastian Shaw, whose abilities can harness any energy around him. With the cold war at its highest tension point, he plans nuclear Armageddon during the Cuban missile crisis. Meanwhile, the young Charles has grown up (James McAvoy) with Raven, aka Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence), whose mutant abilities can take on any human's appearance and together, they discover fellow mutants with some help from the CIA. Erik's (Michael Fassbender) vengeful pursuit of Shaw brings him in alliance with Charles as they recruit mutants into their team to save mankind from the threat of annihilation in the Cuban seas. <br/><br/>Outstanding performances with the sheer intensity of Michael Fassbender and composed intelligence of James McAvoy delineate the determination and ambition of their younger characters whose friendship will be forced to the other ends of morality when they grow into Patrick Stewart's Professor X and Sir Ian McKellan's Magneto.Even though in shorter roles, Kevin Bacon, Jennifer Lawrence, Nicholas Hoult and Rose Byrne are impressive. For a super hero movie, the acting is indeed First Class. Not to forget, the visual treat of January Jones as Emma Frost.<br/><br/>Vaughn consistently builds the dramatic tension with the situations between USA and Russia, Shaw and Charles, and finally, between Charles and Erik. The backdrop of the Cuban missile crisis and Shaw's doomsday plan remind us of the Mr.Bond but with the X-Men as heroes, Vaughn brings a truly unique dimension to good v/s evil. <br/><br/>The special effects as the mutants test their powers, are dazzling.The sequences involving Magneto lifting the submarine and then stopping a barrage of missiles are jaw dropping.Vaughn leaves no stone unturned in unleashing action that is visually striking while some exemplary acting keeps one engaged in an intriguing plot. X-Men:First Class is not only a system reboot but it also sets certain standards for super hero films especially this season. Seldom has it been so much fun in going into to the past of our favorite characters and relating every incident and event with who and what they become. Not since the transition of Darth Vader himself, has it even been so pleasing to see a villain proclaiming himself as Magneto did. <br/><br/>The lines of morality are blurry and one cannot take sides too easily in the formation of the X-Men and while being entertained, one can clearly sense the feeling of fulfillment in an almost flawless story that you wouldn't want to see the end of. This is truly, a First Class adventure you don't want to miss....<br/><br/>8.521 on a scale of 1-10."
"kidlantern67","9","6","10","10 June 2011"," First Class all around!!!
","I went to see X-Men: First Class on Saturday afternoon with my lovely wife. As the end credits rolled a sense of real satisfaction from watching an incredibly solid film washed over me. I liked the movie a ton but would my wife feel the same? She hasn't read many comics and doesn't follow the exploits of most superheroes. In other words, she represents the general audience when it comes to superhero fare. The film was able to garner high praise from her with the epic statement, ""If you see the guy in our building who sells bootleg DVDs and if he's got X-Men: First Class, buy it. I want to see it again."" <br/><br/>Now kiddies, I by no means condone or comply with the purchasing of pirated videos. I categorically do not! But if that is your cup of tea who am I to judge. But the fact that my wife a non-comic book fan was totally enthralled and entertained by this film is no small feat. I know I annoy the hell out of her with my fan boy rants and ravings, but she tolerates it because she loves me. Aw! But I digress. <br/><br/>X-Men: First Class hit so many nails on the head it should apply for a carpentry license. The casting of James McAvoy as Professor X and Michael Fassbender as Magneto originally drew some skepticism from this humble reviewer. Patrick Stewart and Sir Ian MacKellen seemed to be born to play the roles they made even more famous in the previous three X-Men films. How could McAvoy and Fassbender top these fine thespians? They didn't top them but they definitely matched them. McAvoy, who was told not to do a Stewart impersonation, gave the role of young Professor X a sense of joy, wonderment and hope that Stewart's portrayal lacked; which isn't knocking Stewart, by no means. X-men: First Class portrays a Charles Xavier before he became wheelchair-bound, so of course his world would seem a little brighter and rose-colored. McAvoy pulls off this Pollyanna portrayal with perfect aplomb. McAvoy is one of the best young actors of our time. He is solid in everything he does. See Wanted, Atonement and The Last King of Scotland to see how good he is.<br/><br/>Michael Fassbender's portrayal as Magneto, Master of Magnetism, is spot on. While Sir Ian played Magneto as a man full of pi$$ and vinegar that has seen it all, Fassbender meanwhile plays the future villain exactly the same but with a little bit more gravitas and pathos. Fassbender's portrayal is so human you can't help but like his Erik. Even as Magneto's quest for revenge begins to take permanent root, gut- wrenchingly you begin to actually root for the man even though you know he will become the murderously human-hating purveyor of Superiority. <br/><br/>Director Matthew Vaughn masterfully weaves a tapestry of swinging 1960's James Bond-like intrigue, Munich-style man-hunting and Marvel Comics mayhem with pitch perfect plot and pacing. Together, this becomes a crazy quilt of must-see appeal. Vaughn shows us three dimensional characters that we want to know even more about. Because of his direction and assist with the script, Vaughn gives us a Mystique we never saw in the first three films. She goes from partially- clad set piece to full-fledged character as portrayed by Oscar-nominee Jennifer Lawrence. <br/><br/>When I first heard about Kevin Bacon playing Sebastian Shaw, I must admit it gave me pause. I was like, ""Mr. Footloose himself playing one of the nastiest X-Men villains of all time? No way""! But after seeing X- Men: First Class, my world view was a little shaken. Now Bacon is a great actor, we all know this, but sometimes folks are miscast; Jessica Alba's Invisible Woman anyone? After seeing Bacon do his version of a Bond villain I had to admit it; he did his thing! That's a term used in around the neighborhood. With his mutant ability to absorb energy, Bacon's Shaw absorbed our attention with his slick oiliness every time he was on screen. <br/><br/>Honorable mentions go out to Rose Byrne as Moira MacTaggert, Nicholas Hoult as Beast and January Jones (wooden acting didn't bother me here) as Emma Frost for their performances. It was cool to see Moira finally fleshed out by a capable actress in Byrne. And Hoult was nerdy-fun as hairy Hank McCoy. Hopefully we'll see more of this actor in the future. Other X-Men, Banshee (Caleb Landry Jones) and Havok (Lucas Till) are given appropriate screen time and give the film much needed comedy relief. <br/><br/>Make sure you see the mutant gathering montage in the middle of the movie. There are some mutant cameos not to be missed; one in particular is laugh out loud funny.<br/><br/>X-Men: First Class is definitely on the level of X2 and easily surpasses the miss that was X-3. Although X-Men: First Class, plays fast and loose with not only the comics' continuity but the previous movies as well, I suggest checking that simple fact at the door when seeing this film. I know there will be Hardcore fans who won't be able to get past that but please get over yourself otherwise you will be missing one of the better superhero films ever made."
"Aaron1375","9","6","10","6 June 2011"," This X-men movie is a first class ride.
","This X-men movie was great, out of all the X-men films this one ranks second to the second as X2 still holds the title as number one X-men film. This one is not to far behind, the only reason I did not give it a 10 are some problems this one has when tied with the other films. I know they say it is a reboot, but if that were the case why were there so many things tying this to the other films? Seriously, in a reboot you would change costumes and looks of characters, in this one when the young X-men wear their costumes for the first time Beast's costume looks like the one he wore in The Last Stand when he commented that he could not believe it used to fit him. That and it opened with a scene that looked as if it came right out of the first film, the awakening of a young Magento's powers. Enough of whether it is a prequel or a reboot, what it was for me was an entertaining film. The story has Eric (later to be known as Magneto) trying to find the man responsible for the death of his mother, a man who goes by the name of Sebastian Shaw. Meanwhile, Charles Xavier is writing papers and is a bit of a flirt as he and a young woman by the name of Raven have formed a special bond. Well it is not long before the two meet up as there is a wonderful scene where Eric finds Sebastian, and the army finds them both on Sebastian's boat. They soon join up and begin recruiting other mutants as Shaw has other mutants working for him so they think they need more to help in their struggle against him. The action is great here culminating in a great battle at the end and the full awakening of Magneto's powers. The effects are really good in this one too as is the acting. Nice to see Kevin Bacon in an extended role in this movie, when I first saw he was going to appear in this one I was afraid it would be nothing more than an extended cameo. The guy they got to play Magneto was great as I could actually see him looking like Ian McKellen when he ages. The guy playing Xavier is good too, just do not see him looking much like Patrick Stewart, but this goes back to the point of whether this is a prequel to those films or a reboot. I am sorry, but to me it seems like a prequel so the thing that happens to Charles at the end of this one does not really work in the context of the third film as in that one he and Eric visit a young Jean Grey and Charles is walking, also the fact that at the end of this one they are essentially against each other so chances are they would not be visiting her together unless even Eric felt her powers were in need of guidance at the time so he agreed to accompany Charles because of her being such a special case. Also, the end of Wolverine has an appearance of Charles at the end and he is walking, this one can be explained as the appearance of Charles could be akin to what Emma Frost did to the Russian dude here in that he simply made himself appear to the young X-men. Like I said though this may be a reboot making all these points groundless except for the many things tying this film to the other four movies. Other than this gripes it was a totally solid film, the best I have seen so far in the summer of 2011, mind you there are still many movies I intend to see. I also have to say this film features one of the best villain deaths ever, of course after that death the birth of one of the best villains ever begins."
"tavm","8","6","10","3 June 2011"," X-Men: First Class is another worthy entry in the Marvel Comics film series
","Having previously seen the three X-Men films not to mention read the comics during the Chris Claremont '80s, I had a big interest in seeing this depiction of the beginnings of the team of hero mutants as founded by one Charles Xavier. That said, the real exciting action doesn't go into high gear until near the end but by then there is real compelling drama concerning the main characters of the later known Professor X (James McAvoy) and his initial friend-turned-nemesis Magneto (Michael Fassbender). They along with Kevin Bacon as someone Magneto wants vengeance against-Sebastian Shaw-make the film truly worth seeing and brings this entry down to earth whenever things seem to take a direction that I'm not sure of. Having said that, the director Matthew Vaughn is one who takes care to make sure the other mutant characters don't get too much short shrift so on that note, X-Men: First Class comes highly recommended."
"killerkitestrings","9","6","10","3 June 2011"," I was pleasantly surprised.
","I went in expecting, you know, just another X-men movie, with nothing really exceptional or different happening. What I saw was the best X-Men movie to date. All the actors played their parts well and believably, there was a lot of action in it, and it was just an all around enjoyable movie. There were very few cheesy or useless parts in it. <br/><br/>When you watch this movie you are able to feel each character... their motivations, etc. Whether they are a ""good"" or ""bad"" character. In fact, the lines between the good and the bad are a little bit blurred in this movie, which makes it seem more realistic. Different characters have different motivations, which may be beneficial to one group while detrimental to another. Overall, it was a great movie and I hope it does well."
"ajs-10","9","6","10","1 June 2011"," Excellent
","It isn't often I get to see a film on the first day of release, but due to a timely week off work I was able to make it to the first screening at my local cinema. There was no need to rush, the other eight people there were well spread out and I had an entire row (or six) to myself! I guess I should talk about the film that's why you're reading this after all. Really enjoyable with quite a complicated plot but I found that despite a running time of over two hours it really flew by! Testament to the writers, actors, director and everyone else involved, it's a big thumbs up from me.<br/><br/>We are told the story of how Charles Xavier founded his school for mutants in 1963. How he and his best friend, Erik Lehnsherr, later to be known as Magneto, had differing visions for the future for mutants. The stories of Hank McCoy (Beast) and Raven (Mystique), amongst others, are also told, particularly how Raven grew up with Charles but ultimately couldn't see his vision. The narrative is set against the Cuban Missile Crisis, which, for the purposes of this story, is manipulated by one Sebastian Shaw, who has his own reasons for wanting to start a nuclear war. Shaw also has a very strong significance to Erik but I'm not going to tell you about that here (no spoilers here).<br/><br/>Great performances all round, particularly from; James McAvoy as Charles Xavier, Michael Fassbender as Erik Lehnsherr / Magneto, Kevin Bacon as Sebastian Shaw, Rose Byrne as CIA agent Moira MacTaggert, Jennifer Lawrence as Raven / Mystique and Nicholas Hoult as Hank McCoy / Beast.<br/><br/>As we have come to expect from these films, the special effects are of the highest quality. Fortunately this does not distract from the excellent plot that gives so much more depth to the main characters. There is a fair amount of humour as well, look out for a very brief appearance from Wolverine (very funny). Over all, an exceedingly well made film that I hope becomes a big hit. It's intelligent without ever talking down to the audience and I really enjoyed it. I would be happy to see it again and it's already pencilled in to be added to by DVD collection Recommended.<br/><br/>My Score 8.5/10"
"n_burli","2","9","17","18 September 2011"," Have all the fans gone mad?
","I cannot believe the fact that I literally had to go looking for a bad review to convince myself I'm not the only one. The film was the most disappointing series ever made, and this is saying a lot since Wolverine used to be the worst series in my book. Mathew Vaughn clearly does not know how to make a super-hero film.<br/><br/>The story looked like it was written by a 10 year old. The only convincing characters were Xavier & Magneto, the rest were just there to fill screen space. Before I watched the film I saw the trailer and I thought ""This is gonna be the best film ever"". The fact that they had the balls to merge a fictional story with an event that actually took place in history was a bold move. However, the presentation was just pathetic. This film will probably be epic through the eyes of a 14 year old but any age-group beyond that should have walked out of the theater laughing his/ her ass off. There comes a time when one must be able to differentiate between cliché & originality. ""Mutant & Proud"", are you kidding me? WE KNOW they're mutants, we know they have super-human powers, saying mutant over and over and over again does not make the message any clearer. ""You want the Mutants? Take them, just let us normal people go"" The dialogs could not be worse.<br/><br/>Why would anyone make fun of super-hero abilities? Especially the ones depicted in the film. I can understand Beast, his feet are quite ugly. The scene where the two security guards come about and start making fun of the kids was nothing but hilarious. <br/><br/>Xavier and Eric are supposed to have had a rich history, not something that just ends within a span of two hours. Apart from the fact that Xavier gets paralyzed in the dumbest manner possible, did they HAVE to do it so soon? Is this the history of how Charles Xavier looses his legs, is this the history of the friendship between him and Magneto? Is it really? This is it? Nothing more? No epic battle sequence between the two symbolizing the end of their bond? When I thought of the break of friendship between the two I was thinking Naruto & Saske (Apologies to those of you who don't understand you may Google it out and get the facts in an instant). <br/><br/>Kevin Bacon as whoever the hell he's supposed to be has done the most ridiculous acting I have ever seen. The Diamond chick was a blond in the most Literal sense of the word, and what was up with Xavier's students? He uses Cerebro to find an army and those guys are the only ones he could find? Are you serious? If I have the power to contact other Mutants I'll make a whole damn' army with it, not recruit some no good kids who have no idea how to fight (or act).<br/><br/>The scene with Magneto killing the three guys in the bar could have been so much more. A stab to the head rather than the stomach, a slit to the throat (depicted by a blood splatter to the wall) than a pussy stab to the hand, to which the reaction was like he was on opium. If the gun in my hand is being controlled not by my own will, my first reaction would be to let it go!<br/><br/>So fine, Magneto had to turn against everyone. Mystique had to come to his side, but mere dialogs aren't enough to satisfy an audience. There was nothing emotional about it, nor was it tragic, and honestly, I saw it coming five minutes after the film started.<br/><br/>The Visual Effects looked like it was from the 70's. I swear to god Star Wars (1977) looks more realistic than this.<br/><br/>This film could have been the greatest origin story ever. There is no reason to ever believe that this is even close to a good film, especially for the fans. I really shouldn't say this because I'm agnostic, but God help the future of this series."
"adrinit","9","5","8","24 June 2011"," What a surprise!
","I gotta confess something: when I saw the ""X-Men Origins"" I said to myself: ""For Christ's sake Marvel, PLEASE STOP making x-men movies, 4 movies are quite enough to saturate the story!"". The movie was not that bad, actually. But several and several movies from one single comic is something that deserves concerns.<br/><br/>Well.. When I found out that a new X-Men movie was about to debut, I got excited, but at the same time, concerned about saturating EVEN MORE the comic. OK, the trailer looked AWESOME, fantastic actors and amazing special effects. ""WOOOW!"", I thought. But after seeing this movie, the first word that came to my mind was ""WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW!!""... man, it worth SO much! Without a doubt, the most terrific from all previous. In addition to an excellent script and memorable dialogues, Charles Xavier, played by James McAvoy, was absolutely captivating..Excellent choice from director Matthew Vaughn. I gotta say that ALL the support cast was great too. (WHAT WAS THAT LINE PLAYED BY WOLVERINE??? LOL!!!)<br/><br/>But for Magneto, my fav. character, played by the fantastic Sir Ian McKellen in the previous ones and now played by Michael Fassbender, I must write a separated paragraph. Fassbender, what a stunning actor! He completely stole the scene. His feelings for revenge and friendship, all mixed up with his fears and traumas, developed a remarkable performance to the audience. Magneto is that unique type of villain that people LOVE to hate. And Fassbender seemed to know exactly what that means :) It was kind of sad to see his friendship with Charles Xavier ruined by his hate and desire for revenge. But the final scene of them, man.. was epic!<br/><br/>For me, personally, was a delightful surprise. I recommended to all my friends to go see this movie. But Marvel, PLEASE, 5 movies is quite enough, OK? The fifth movie was the highest achievement, don't need to make any other after that, seriously :)"

It was made for your demographic.<br/><br/>If on the other hand you expect decent acting and direction in your comic book movies, together with some comic relief, an intelligent script, and effects that allow you to suspend disbelief instead of looking at your watch during the big CGI scenes, this movie has -none- of those things, not one iota.<br/><br/>Kevin Bacon? great actor, awful comic book movie villain. Rest of the cast are no-names, and it shows, painfully. The script is trite white hat/black hat fare, dredging up the Nazis in case you ""Moscow, Russia"" folks can't figure out who the bad guy is. Maybe three comic relief moments in the film, no one in the packed theater with me laughed... ever. In fact, I suspect everyone else in the theater was busy looking at their watches with me.<br/><br/>Painful and very dishonestly hyped here and elsewhere."

","I thought that the movie was great. Other then the scene where shaw kills magneto's mother, the beginning of the movie starts off a little slow but once Moria mets Xavier, the story starts to pick up. James McAvoy was an awesome Charles Xavier. You see him go from young party guy to a more distinguished man. I wish at the end of the movie they would have explained why he is bald but hopefully we will find out in the sequel. Michael Fassbender as Magneto is prefect. By far the best performance in this film is Fassbender. He is a huge star in the making. I think the movie did a good job with their friendship and showing at the end that they respect each other but they disagree and must go there separate ways. Kevin Bacon as Sebastian Shaw was surprising very good and a great villain. The scenes on the beach are awesome. I was very happy with the movie overall and I am so excited for a sequel. Hopefully they will add Cyclops or Gambit, or at least someone more well known then Banshee or Havok. Matthew Vaughn did a great job. He should direct every X-Men movie for now on. I thought it was one of the best superhero movies that I have seen."

","There are a few things that a summer blockbuster should be. First and foremost, they should be entertaining. Summer is all about being big and being fun. Secondly, they should be well made. Good acting, good direction, good script...films in general should have this, but a good summer film can back up it's special effects and action with quality filmmaking. And finally, they should focus more on the deeper things, like themes and humanity than their shallow action or comedy elements. First Class, much to my surprise, embodies all of these and creates a truly wonderful summer blockbuster.<br/><br/>While many might be skeptical that the fifth X-men film would certainly be one of the worst, the fact is, it's probably the best. Where the other films tried to focus on the Marvel universe and the wow factor of the X-men and their powers, pleasing fanboys with wonderful visuals and nods here and there, First Class puts it's characters first. Sure, it's nothing we haven't seen before, but the focus on the characters first is a welcome change. In fact, it makes me think of the original X-men film, a film which is now more than ten years old. The quality of the filmmaking here is leagues beyond the original film. Here we have top notch performances, and while there is certainly no outranking Patrick Steward and Ian McKellen, the entire cast for First Class seems to work so very well. I can't remember enjoying the entire ensemble cast from the original trilogy as much as I did here. This is certainly thanks to Matthew Vaughn, who seems to do an extremely good job handling origin stories. Much like he did with Kick Ass, this film is well grounded, despite featuring a large number of mutant power-fueled action sequences.<br/><br/>And that's the real trick here. The film strikes the perfect balance between action and drama. There is one scene in particular between Charles and Erik that is very touching and goes far beyond any scene from any of the previous X-Men films. The action is very fun too, and some of my favorites of these involve Banshee's combination of flight and super sonic super powers. Suffice to say, while this film could have simply been a great action film with great performances, in the same way Thor was, it goes beyond by adding a load of heart. There's even some nods to the original films, including an applause inducing cameo, that will have fans salivating. <br/><br/>Suffice to say, I can't praise the film enough. It's certainly not without it's flaws. Kevin Bacon's performance, when in comparison to the others, is a little underwhelming. As others have said, he hams it up. And it's not even so bad, except that everyone else just plays their parts so well, his seems a little, as stated, underwhelming. Other parts seem to be thrown in without much to do, namely Darwin, who is barely on screen. But these are minor complaints, as this is a fantastic comic book film. While Marvel's lineup has come a long way, their films continue to get better and better. First Class is a large step in the right direction for the X-Men series of films. If they were to say they were giving the series a reboot, with this kind of quality, you would have no complaints from me."

","I'd read a few reviews all saying the same thing: very good film, just a bit too fast-paced and with some ropey CGI; could have been the best X- Men film.<br/><br/>I disagree. It IS the best X-Men film. Yes, there is some ropey effects at time, and Michael Fassbender's Irish brogue comes out in the last 20 minutes of the film, and that's the only reason I didn't rate this a 10! Even so, the film is tightly directly, brilliantly filmed and scored; the plot is engaging and exciting, and the central performances are superb. I didn't think I say this, but: Sir Ian who? Sir Patrick who? (N.b. they are still brilliant, but McAvoy and Fassbender are too)<br/><br/>I won't go overboard, but the film had me on the edge of my seat a lot and I was SO happy to see what I wanted: a real bad-ass Magneto. Erik, as he is here, is like a proto-Bond with superpowers and a bad attitude. I loved the re-use (and subtle re-filming) of the original concentration camp opening, and the subsequent rage shown by Erik when his mother dies. Nazi helmets never looked so figure hugging... and Michael Fassbender steals every scene he's in (in my opinion). <br/><br/>Oh yes, and there's a brilliant cameo from a certain hairy actor who delivers the film's ""f-bomb"". <br/><br/>In summary, a exciting reinvigoration that I will see again and again, ignoring the tiny tiny flaws."

Matthew Vaughan's sense of storytelling in this new chapter of the X-men series is wonderful. It is a great way to introduce basically new characters in a new chapter of their lives that we have never seen. It has a good sense of mood, with a fun atmosphere. The overall style to the film is great, with good set pieces and clothing to fit in with the 1960s time period. It is possible to have an X-men film without Hugh Jackman's Wolverine for over a minute. With a good b-plot, good music, fun,smart storytelling, Vaughan's new X-men characters will be beloved!"
"Sisiutil","5","3","4","12 January 2013"," Undone by its best scene
","The best scene in X-Men: First Class is, arguably, the brief cameo by Hugh Jackman/Wolverine. Unfortunately, that scene also undermines much of the logic of the film.<br/><br/>Just in case you aren't aware of it, a young Charles Xavier (Professor X) and Erik Lehnsherr (Magneto) encounter Wolverine in a bar as part of their efforts to recruit mutants to a team they're forming. They introduce themselves; he promptly and rudely tells them to go away, which they promptly do. It's a very short, very funny scene, a crowd-pleaser, and arguably one of the best scenes in the film, if not the best. It also, unfortunately, ruins the movie.<br/><br/>I can live with a prequel introducing continuity errors into a franchise, which X-Men: First Class does. I can live with an adaptation from another medium making significant changes to established characters--again, the film does this several times. What I cannot accept, however, is a film where supposedly intelligent characters repeatedly make stupid decisions, committing the same mistake over and over, and thereby undermine all their efforts to achieve their goals.<br/><br/>Back to that scene and how it illustrates this problem. Assuming that at least some of the facts about Logan from the comics and X-Men Origins: Wolverine are still true in this semi-reboot, Logan is an extremely experienced and talented fighter who is over 150 years old at the time of this story. Xavier and Lehnsherr are going up against a team of powerful, mature mutants, and yet they abandon recruiting this formidable warrior after a one-sentence brush off. Instead they bring in a group of children, essentially, who are under-powered and/or have little to no control over their powers. It logically would have taken years to shape those X-cadets into anything resembling a potent fighting force--time which, according to the logic of the story, Xavier and Lehnsherr didn't have.<br/><br/>And frankly, the kids aren't very interesting characters. Even if the scene with Wolverine had been dropped to avoid calling attention to the problem I've outlined, it still wouldn't help this charisma-challenged first X-Men team. The movie works best when it focuses on Xavier and Lehnsherr and their complex friendship. The writers could have left out the X-babies and just used Prof X and Magneto and we'd have a much better film. Either that or they should have been recruiting a group of older, more experienced mutants who would have been more of a match out of the gate for Shaw and his cabal.<br/><br/>There were some things I liked about this film (mainly the Xavier/Magneto bromance, but also the many exciting action sequences) and others I didn't (such as the awkward insertion of anti-mutant sentiment, January Jones' underwhelming portrayal of Emma Frost, Mystique's under-written motivation for joining Magneto, the many anachronisms such as Banshee's hairstyle, etc.) Overall, I was disappointed because with a few simple changes X-Men: First Class could have been a much better movie. The first two X-Men films still haven't been equalled. Bryan Singer, come back to the director's chair, we miss you!"
"ironhorse_iv","7","3","4","12 December 2012"," X marks the spot
","This movie is hard to say if it's a prequel or reboot when the movie opening is similar or the same with that of the first X-Men 2000 movie. At first glance, it can be confusing as it looks like the audience is watching that movie. Erik Lesherr aka Magneto (Michael Fassbasser) seek for the death of Klaus Schmidt aka Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) for the death of his mother during the Holocaust. It takes him forever to find the right time to kill him and the movie fails to connect the dots between what happen to him from childhood to adulthood. Due to the film absenting much of his past, the audience is to believe through flashbacks that he suffers from harsh experiments by Shaw or that he went to work for him, but deep inside wanted to kill him. What ever happen, 1962 Magneto is now on a hunt for Shaw. Michael Fassbasser is brilliant in the role, as he able to speak Spanish, French, English, & German very clear, unlike Kevin Bacon whom Russian and German doesn't match what's coming out of his mouth. Still Michael's voice spokes different between him speaking a foreign language to that or English. His English is in a higher pitch. Michael is able to act in a sinister matter without speaking, and able to portray a man in rage. Magneto soon become a good friend with Charles Xavier aka Professor X (James McAvoy) on his quest when Xavier save his life. McAvoy was able to portray a new light of Charles as a smart young sexed up, self-serving man while having the selfless, egoless good for mankind ideas. Sooner than later, these two men would end up being enemies as both men have different views of life and revenge. Professor X is against murder despite him trying to kill a character later on the film, and him knowing Magneto kill people in the past. There wasn't a hero to really follow and get behind. Fans are not supposed to firmly get behind Professor X or Magneto as they are supposed to see both of their points of view and be a little conflicted. Then with shape-shifter Raven aka Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence). Mystique was never a good person; she was always a manipulative borderline sociopathic monster. But in this one she was one of the good guys despite she was friends with Charles since childhood but totally abandons him paralyzed. Jennifer Lawrence just seems awkward in the role, due to the make-up and CGI being not that good. In some scenes where she changing her form; the body and face doesn't match. She willing to hit on the male leads, as well as supporting character Dr. Hank McCoy aka Beast. The actor looks awkward in the Beast form. The Beast's make up and suit was just not menacing enough. It needed more build to it to make Beast look strong. Charles and Eric go off to find other mutants to join their team against Shaw and his group whom trying to start World War 3 between Russia and USA using real life events such as Cuba Missile Crisis. They got CIA officer MacTaggert, Banshee, Darwin, Havok and nearly got Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. Wolverine would only have the only curse word in the movie. Having Wolverine introduced in the film was to bring the comic fans and fans of the previous films to see the movie, but having Darwin introduced just to be used to be killed off. As for most of the other characters they were only present so the film could demonstrate various powers using today's special effects. Banshee, Havok, etc were nothing but cardboard cutouts. They had no character development what so ever, they were there simply to look cool. Shaw's group made out of Riptide, Angel, Azazel continues to create chaos while Shaw's strongest member Emma Frost (January Jones) put the final touches to the plan, getting the Russians to move their missiles to Cuba. January Jones's Emma Frost isn't much of a character, but more like eye candy. She wears skimpy to no clothes during the film. She gives nothing to the role, like Kevin Bacon gives nearly nothing new to Sebastian Shaw, but the 1960's look to the character. The 1960s setting of X-Men: First Class had that James Bond look. The scene in the bar in Argentina can pretty much look and acts like Michael Fassbender pitch perfect as badass, charming, ruthless and sweet Sean Connery's style personality while having that tense moment western shootout. They did a cool job representing the period like showing old Las Vegas, and the way the character dress in a way it still felt muscular and action-oriented as if reading the 1960's comic book. The X-Men yellow and blue costumes resemble the ones in the original comics, while looking space age for the action scenes. The action scenes were great in the film. Most of the visual and special effects work out. Henry Jackman composed score worked for the film as it goes into a heroic epic super hero theme to disjointed disturbing beat when Magneto does something bad. The film does an OK version of paid homage to the original source material while taking it in a new direction with a fresh, young cast, but it does go wrong with the lore of the story to the point it's beyond fixable. Writers do whatever they want with the characters and their origins and powers and such that the movies don't follow each other. It doesn't even follow the first team of X-men from the book, but if comic books fans are able to turn their mind off and just watch it as a stand alone film. It's watchable. The film has to be an alternate history for the X-Men to work. It stilled a better film, then the previous films like X-Men 3 & Origins."
"wen77","4","3","4","26 May 2012"," back of the class *potential spoilers*
","If you are going for mindless big action fun, you'll probably be mildly amused and then forget all about it. The special effects are standard not mind blowing, but sufficient. I find personally it is the subtle touches, the emotion evoked rather than big flashy gestures that impress and those were lacking. The jokes are cheesy but in places fun.<br/><br/>The fundamental reason this fails is the very same reason that the Return of the Sith failed. Neither of these films respect the inherent conflicts of the main characters and fail miserably to use them to their full potential. For me this film was exciting for one reason and one reason only, the Charles/Erik back story. To see enemies as friends, drawn together by a secret that alienates them from the world, to see prejudice and fear pull them apart until they stand on opposite sides of a chasm they don't know how to bridge. This was the heart that was missing from this movie. They are portrayed as blandly civil allies, temporarily bonded but always clear on their path- which might have worked if that path had been diverted at any point- it wasn't and we know it isn't in the future, the limitation of the prequel. Further potential is squandered in the sister/brother relationship between Mystique and Charles. It could have been a great opportunity to develop Charles and knock him from his perfect perch, as he has the position, easily abused, of benevolent benefactor, as well as friend. Instead he is once again blandly civil in every aspect. Mystique as the premier female baddie of the franchise, is reinvented as mild, sweet and apparently in love with every lead male, which (minus the last point) had potential, yet again it is handled with a shovel.<br/><br/>The emotional wasteland is made all the worse by the painfully linear storyline. What happened to Erik after he was separated from his family?Answered in the first five minutes. How has this shaped him as a man? The next five minutes. Which also make sure you know who the bad guy is, just how bad he is and leave no confusion about his villainous interests and why he is working with mutants. Also shoehorned in are various other convenient set-ups which make sure we get instantly bang up to date. So that the next film, which while I'm sure it will have some funky 70's disco tunes, will be pretty much exactly the same in all the respects that matter as every other film in the franchise, just without the wit, depth or resonance that Singer brought to the first two."
"asda-man","4","4","6","19 June 2014"," Should go straight to the chokey!
","I should probably start by saying that this is my first X Men movie. They've never interested me before and neither has any superhero movie really. I've never seen Captain America, Thor or even The Avengers which everyone seems to rave about. I just find them a bit silly and geeky. If I was 10 years younger or a fan boy then I might like them, but I'm not. I'm not completely against superhero films though. Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy features two of my favourite films of all time (TDK and TDKR) but they have an element of realism and are just exceptionally made.<br/><br/>I decided to give First Class a go because everyone was raving about the latest X Men film, Days of Future Past. Plus, I had heard a lot of great things about First Class and it was directed by Matthew Vaughn who directed the brilliant Kick-Ass (another comic book film I actually really like). However, this film really didn't live up to its hype.<br/><br/>I just don't understand all the love for this film. I found it pretty laughable from the moment it started with the terrible child actors and melodrama verging on parody. The moment where Erik's mother gets shot by Nazi Kevin Bacon (no, I'm not making that up) should've been heart-breaking and really emotional, but the scene just ended up being a joke! The bombastic music, the over-acting from the kid and Kevin Bacon and the rushed directing just meant that I couldn't take the film seriously. Unfortunately the rest of the film continues in this manner.<br/><br/>First Class is definitely a film only kids or fan boys would appreciate. It's so daft and contrived with flat characters. Kevin Bacon is a complete caricature as the villain and the X men themselves are also very cartoony. James McAvoy's character was particularly obnoxious, although I did enjoy Michael Fassbender's slightly more complex character of Erik, who ends up turning into a caricature villain for little reason.<br/><br/>Even though the film is over two hours in length it still feels very rushed and withdrawn. The constant globe-trotting meant that you never knew exactly where you are or what's going on! The screenplay is also terribly contrived and very cheesy. All of the dialogue feels incredibly forced and I couldn't help but curl my toes with the end line where Michael Fassbender says, ""No not Erik... I'm Magneto!"" Some of the imagery was also just downright bizarre! A man puts his head in a fish tank and grows gills whilst a stripper flutters about with fairy wings whilst shooting fire from her mouth! I don't know what the writers were smoking, but I'd try some!<br/><br/>I also found the film quite sexist. It seemed compulsory for all the female characters to show as much leg as possible, even those who worked in the FBI. The FBI agent even goes a step further by stripping down to her bra and pants to covertly follow a bunch of prostitutes into a location. Most, if not all the female characters were objectified in some way and I found it a little depressing. Jennifer Lawrence's sexy blue character was even given ageless cells or something, which explains why she doesn't age in the later films, even though the men do because otherwise she wouldn't be sexy anymore.<br/><br/>Most of the action relied on CGI and a lot of it looked pretty appalling and I think it will age extremely badly in a few years time. Having said that, I did quite enjoy how off the wall the action scenes were, especially the last half hour where a submarine levitates out of the ocean, an anchor slices a ship in half and fifty missiles are deflected back into the ocean. It's just insane, and so daft that it's actually really fun to watch.<br/><br/>I was never bored during First Class because it was very entertaining, but not in a good way. It was kind of so bad it was good and I started to have fun counting all of the contrived and cheesy lines. I find it baffling how seriously well-liked this film is though. Everything about this film is very over-the-top from the acting to the action sequences. It's also very poorly written with dull characters making puzzling decisions. The way Jennifer Lawrence's character suddenly joined the bad side wasn't explained at all! First Class is a complete mess, but it's a pretty entertaining one. I won't be wasting any money on Days of Future Past though."

This is saying something considering the fact that Wolverine is my favourite X-Men character -although he does feature with an amusing cameo.<br/><br/>One of the things I loved about this film was seeing the origins of many characters and seeing how relationships formed and developed. It was interesting to see the contrast in this film from the main three, particularly regarding Professor X and Magneto.<br/><br/>The fact that this film is a prequel to the main films means that anybody could watch it and understand the story line. I definitely recommend this film to anyone and I think that those who would not normally watch this genre of film may be pleasantly surprised."

","Well I'm a fan of X-Men - not in a fanboy way - I've read a few comics, grew up watching their cartoons - so generally am quite forgiving even of the more mediocre x-men films. This film however for me just dropped the ball. The guy playing Xavier was simply awful, not only a bad actor but unpleasantly smug too - a smugness that seeped into the tone of the whole film. Also the film felt strangely low budget and well... grey.. lacking panache.<br/><br/>Overall I found it baffling how an X-men film could be so dreary and left me wondering why the film was even made as it seemed to lack any passion or creativity."
"redbud211","2","4","6","22 November 2011"," Disappointment
","Totally agree with the review by wally_greeneyes_dee (posted in June). This movie did not stay true to any of the characters of X-Men at all, in any fashion.<br/><br/>If you go into the movie knowing anything about the X-Men and their relationships going forward, nothing in this movie parallels. Professor Xavier is not as controlled and stoic, but more of a loose cannon. None of the characters act in any resemblance to their comic-book persona.<br/><br/>The dialogue is cheesy (although we can allow for some of that, being based on comic characters). It is hard to explain in detail everything that is exactly off about this movie, but overall it is just wrong in so many ways that at the end you feel very let down."
"fleetstar","4","4","6","9 October 2011"," Hmmmn................I don't think so.
","Well, where to begin. Unfortunately I read the X-Men comics in the 1960's, and this doesn't reflect the style of those stories.<br/><br/>Why is that Hollywood film makers, think that they can change everything into what they want it to be. What was so bad about the original comic stories that they have to be re-written into something that changes the essence of the whole experience.<br/><br/>Where were the original X-Men, Cyclops, Iceman, Angel etc and do we really need the relationships changing this radically. This type of alteration is unforgivable. Go and see Kenneth Branagh, and get him to make the thing properly.<br/><br/>I haven't really any complaints about the acting, as everyone did a good job. As a film for anyone unfamiliar with the early X-men comics I suppose it could pass for a reasonable superhero film. It's just really sad that this chance to make an excellent origin film has now probably gone for good. <br/><br/>I won't be rushing to watch the next one. Poor job, must try harder !"
"SpeedyEric","10","4","6","3 June 2011"," X-Men: First Class
","Many of you have heard them all; sequels, prequels, spin-offs, remakes, and reboots, but ""X-Men: First Class"" is something different: a refresh.<br/><br/>The best description of a refresh I can make is where the film makers take a film series, make a prequel type movie, but make a new continuity while putting in elements audiences can recognize from the original films. Producer Bryan Singer and company did a smart move with ""X-Men: First Class,"" similar but different to what Christopher Nolan did with his Batman films. Even if you haven't seen any to all of the previous films, you won't be left in the dark.<br/><br/>Many people would say that 20th Century Fox and Marvel Comics refreshed the film series because the previous 2 films did not meet expectations (even though I like them), but I would agree that this film helped put the franchise back on course. Now I get why they meant when they said that ""The Wolverine"" won't really be a sequel to the 2009 film. I'm hoping the planned sequel in this new series will continue to give us the mutated goods.<br/><br/>Marvel has been pretty successful with their 2011 films so far. ""Thor"" was awesome, ""X-Men: First Class"" was genius, and I'm crossing my fingers for ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" I give ""X-Men: First Class"" a solid Roman numeral 10 (if you know what I mean)."
"judywalker2","4","7","13","25 September 2011"," Quite boring
","I am really surprised that so many people liked this movie. I found it quite boring. Maybe they thought it was a good idea to cast Kevin Bacon as a psycho ex Nazi mutant scientist but I think it was really, really a bad idea. The two leads were okay but for the most part the story was just so, so and really didn't help define the characters at all. In fact some of Erik (ultimately Magneto's) actions are inconsistent to what he should have done with all of his power. Again the character of Charles Xavier is a weakling who is way too emotional about his friends to be effective as a leader. The comic book Xavier has always been better than anything they have put on screen, small or large."
"ThomasMagnumPI","Null","7","13","9 June 2011"," MARVEL is definitely on a roll. Superb Film!
","MARVEL is definitely on a roll! It all started with the huge success of X-Men over a decade ago. So, it's fitting the high water mark comes this summer with X-Men First Class right in the middle of it. Thor was great earlier this summer and Captain America looks even better. Iron Man and the Hulk kicked butt recently. So, if Marvel gets their hired out characters rolling, the sky is the limit. I don't know about Sony's Spider-Man but Fox managed to return the X-Men to greatness. Can't wait to see what Fox does with the next Wolverine and the whole world is eagerly awaiting the Avengers to assemble! <br/><br/>One of the best improvements about First Class over X-Men is that much valuable screen time is spent on background character development. They actually pick up from the scene of young Magneto shown in X-Men. I believe that was probably needed in the first film, but they had so much else to introduce that they got away with showing much less. That's the beauty of this film and now I see why they choose to save Scott, Jean and Storm's introduction for future films. Taking the proper time to establish Charles and Erik was a must and it is very well done. Even in X2, the newer characters that were introduced got very little time devoted to their past. It worked but the way new characters are introduced here works better. People in general are smart and can read between the lines, thus negating the necessity for cumbersome background information in general. Some of that is on display here but they truly flesh out the characters that need it the most. Apparently the director figured out this delicate balance because First Class flows smoothly, with hardly a stutter along the way to break up the action but still delivering an intelligent and moving film."
"LinJason","9","9","18","1 June 2011"," A blockbuster mutant with hybrid powers of an entertaining spectacle & a good film
","Some call this a brilliant franchise reboot, while others might say that it's the star of this summer thus far. I say that X-Men: First Class is a blockbuster mutant, one that sports the hybrid powers of a commercial box office cash cow, an entertaining spectacle, and a good film. Dramatically fueled by some great cast performance, X-Men: First Class makes sure that the message of being different and proud to be, gets across firmly.<br/><br/>Usually from the first frame of the film, you'd know through some insane gut feeling if it'd be a good film. X-Men: First Class is one such film that sends good vibes as it begins in 1944's Poland during World War II. The first chapter of a young Erik Lehnsherr who is able to bend metal gates when emotionally charged, especially of grievance and anger.<br/><br/>That very Erik, as most of us know it, will eventually become Magneto.<br/><br/>Erik is well portrayed by Michael Fassbender who exudes a charismatic demeanour of a classic British spy/gentleman. In aid of simplifying that, think of him as a good resemblance to a young 007 - James Bond. <br/><br/>Daniel Craig should be worried.<br/><br/>Everything points towards that, with the Cold War setting and a offshore stand-off between the US and the Soviet Union in Cuban waters, two of the greatest powers in history. There's an innuendo hint at the real-life Cuban Missile Crisis as they used it to create tension, although not to suggest factual evidence.<br/><br/>Wait, or did mutants actually had a part in it?<br/><br/>That is very much so in the first two thirds of the film when Erik befriends a young Charles Xavier (James McAvoy), who manages to inspire him to goodness that enlightened his magnetic potentials. Strength comes from somewhere between anger and serenity, that sentence alone underlined the core virtues and wise maturity of a young Professor X.<br/><br/>Much like how Charles is the glue to all the mutants featured in this film, Director Matthew Vaughn (of Kick-Ass fame) did an exceptional job and inspired us that blockbusters aren't just a measure of blatant bang-bang-booms and exorbitant senseless sequences. In maintaining a great momentum and pace throughout the 132 minute blockbuster, he confiscated the entirety of the audience's attention span of interest and never giving back until the credit roll.<br/><br/>There's a much desired focus on the story and character development (credits to a big team of story and screenwriters), which in my opinion is the greatest strength of the film that gives it a worthy edge over so many blockbusters that have revolved around the weary tried-and- tested formula. The dialogues were kept witty and at times amusing, which is uncommon of the one-liners often abused by summer blockbusters. Keep in mind that this is another Marvel superhero adaptation, so my expectations prior to the screening was somewhat along the line of a loud routine entertainment.<br/><br/>I was so wrong about it.<br/><br/>There's spectacular action when called for, but never saturated and overboard. Just what'll suffice and contribute to plot plausibility. For that, Vaughn gains my admiration and respect when most other blockbusters have the pressure of installing intentional crowd-pleasing plot devices with the ""more is more"" mentality when it's really just senseless overkill.<br/><br/>All the action you'll find are very nicely coated by stellar visual effects (by the likes of Weta Digital) and scored by Henry Jackman's influential music. I'd also like to add that the score played a critical role in veiling this film with the intended serious overtone and gave it the right feel that also helps with setting the right rhythm. Think along the line of how music gave Avatar its atmospheric life and how it also made Inception feel so grand and mysterious. Production values are very high indeed, especially when you can expect a naval confrontation between an American fleet and a Soviet fleet disturbed by the play of mutants.<br/><br/>Not all of the sideline mutant characters enjoyed adequate limelight in an attempt to avoid the overcrowding disruptive effect on the plot, but Raven (Jennifer Lawrence), Hank McCoy (Nicholas Hoult), and Emma Frost (January Jones) were given some and they made good of the opportunity. Some even offered the audience great eye-candy that doesn't feel forced upon.<br/><br/>Before you'd begin to think that nobody remembers the bad guy, there's Kevin Bacon as Sebastian Shaw (also the nightmare nemesis of Erik's ill-fated childhood) who really resembles an ambitious Hitler with menace. Memorable and rather short-lived in my opinion, but there's no doubt about Bacon's performance here (we're talking about a veteran here, after all).<br/><br/>So there's a great cast, good star performance, alluring story, gripping pace, pleasant eye- candy, high production value, beautiful visual effects, and appealing action sequences. That doesn't sound like a blockbuster, it's a mutated form of it.<br/><br/>Mutant and proud.<br/><br/>Oh and that's not all, also do watch out for a crude brief cameo by a key familiarity."

So that was a slight put-off right at the beginning.<br/><br/>And it DID slightly remind me of Batman Begins with the boys the age they are...<br/><br/>Sadly, this film is not about telling a good story, making you like/love the characters, and making it exciting with fast-paced and mind- blowing special effects (never mind a good story...).<br/><br/>As one reviewer wrote, I too sat wishing I could watch a Transformers film instead.<br/><br/>This film is superficial, wildly edited into short fragments and longer boring passages, has no good special effects, has annoying music, cringe-worthy dialogues, stupid characters with no depth or any development, and the Nazi theme as well as the Bay of Pigs theme was pitiful.<br/><br/>Professor X was screaming NO!!, I was inwardly screaming: Why the hell not?! Just kill the Nazi. For heaven's sake, pacifism only goes so far...lol Later as well - throw the bombs back on them, why the hell not??!! Following orders could have been a good theme taken up, but no, it's an American popcorn film - blown up, filled mostly with air, and totally tasteless unless you add fat, sugar, or salt. <br/><br/>Which they failed to do.<br/><br/>James McAvoy was wrong for this, Michael Fassbender spoke bad German as well (dialogue coach gone awol?) but passable French, Kevin Bacon was my favourite in this as mentioned, and it was a pleasure to see him die - I mean that in a good way.<br/><br/>Bad film."

","Incredibly because I had read more than a dozen reviews on IMDb before I saw the movie and went in expecting to be very entertained. Every review said the same thing 'Great movie!' I settled back, a smile on my face, and after the first ten minutes I went 'Uh? Is this really the plot - that this mutant-powered kid after seeing his mother shot, and after trashing a room full of heavy metal objects, and after crushing two Nazi soldiers inside their helmets, DOESN'T at least try to kill the guy who killed his mother??"" Then it seemed to get worse. The acting was so bad that I was waiting for the joke to be sprung on me - this must be a play within a play, where the play within is really obviously poor...<br/><br/>An hour later, remembering the glowing, enthusiastic reviews, I checked my ticket in case I was not seeing the same move. Then I told myself the second half must be amazing, how else could anyone admire this drivel? The costumes were embarrassing: they reminded me of an Austin Powers farce; the dialogue was so amazingly clichéd that I was guessing the next lines without effort, or error. The director seemed to be missing, presumed dead. The CGI was CGI; after the third time thru watching Raven turn on her blue-skin I was starting to think fondly of Transformers 3. The plot seemed to have been designed by a committee; I imagined a room full of brainstorming writers saying things like 'Wait! let's put Kennedy in there? We got any footage? Cuban Missile Crisis!"" ""Right! hey we need some really heavy type Russian general types, like in Dr. Strangelove only different."" ""Yeah, and lets put a twist in there where after the mutants have saved humanity, all the ships, get this Russian AND American, blow them to smithereens for no apparent reason."" ""Oh yeah, I love it!"" After what I was sure had been 2 hours I ran from the theatre as the credits rolled. I was amazed to find it had only been about 100 minutes. Time flies when you're having fun, and drags when you're not.<br/><br/>My 17 year old son loved it. When I told him I thought it was stunningly bad he asked me if I was in a bad mood. I didn't feel in a bad mood, although my mood had been better when I bought my ticket. I said, ""No, I don't think so. I just think it was a very poor movie.

","""X-Men: First Class"" is an first class ""X-Men"" movie.<br/><br/>""Kiss Ass"" director Matthew Vaughn and scenarists Ashley Miller, Zack Stentz, and Jane Goldman have done a marvelous job depicting the back story to the first ""X-Men"" movie. Furthermore, they have done something ingenious by using Cuban Missile Crisis as part of the story. As Sebastian Shaow, Kevin Bacon makes a superb villain who rarely delivers a threat he doesn't carry out. In his first scene with a young Erik, he threatens to shoot Erik's mom at the Nazi concentration camp if Erik doesn't move a coin on his desk. When Erik cannot summon sufficient power to move the coin a millimeter, Sebastian Shaw shoots her stone cold dead without a qualm. Shaw's cold-blooded murder of Erik's mom triggers a rage in him, and he crunches a small metal ringer bell, some filing cabinets, and then the helmets of the two German soldiers holding his mom. Later, when a high American ranking officer threatens to commit suicide and take Shaw with him, Shaw snatches the hand grenade away from Colonel Hendry and pulls the pin. We watch as he absorbs the explosion before Hendry's eyes. Bacon's villainy knows no bounds. Later, James McAvoy appears as Charles Xavier before he receives his title as a university professor, and Michael Fassbender is the adult form of Erik Lensherr. Erik is in hot pursuit of Shaw. He travels to Argentina to track down Shaw, but he finds only two of his associates in a bar. One says he is a pig farmer and the other is a tailor. Erik disposes of both of them in a slick showdown, stabbing the pig farmer in the hand twice. In one terrific scene, when he finds Shaw aboard his yacht, he uses the anchor of Shaw's yacht to destroy the yacht. <br/><br/>The first scene in the Nazi camp bears an amazing resemblance to the scene in director Bryan Singer's original ""X-Men."" After that creepy scene, director Mathew Vaughn stages the eventful scene in his office with Erik when he guns down his mother. As he leaves Erik alone, he presses the coin into his palm that he had asked Erik to move. Vaughn and his writers show us Charles Xavier at an early age when he encounter Raven for the first time. She is in his kitchen after dark attempting to steal food when he walks in on her with a baseball bat. He exposes her for a fraud because she is masquerading as his late mother. The confrontation concludes with blows as Charles and Raven become life-long friends. <br/><br/>Eventually, the C.I.A. recognizes the presence of mutants when Xavier reads their minds and Raven performs her shape-shifting tricks before their eyes. Meantime, Erik has grown up, and he is searching for Shaw. This time he doesn't have as much luck with his adversaries as he had earlier with a Swiss banker and two Nazis hiding out in Argentina. Shaw and his two mutant friends evict him from their yacht. At the same time, CIA Agent Moria MacTaggert (Rose Byrne) has been on the trail of Shaw. Since she cannot convince her superiors that mutants exist, she invites a recently graduated Xavier to CIA Headquarters with Raven alongside to advise them about the reality of mutants. Naturally, Moria's CIA superiors aren't impressed. Nevertheless, Moria and Charles pursue Shaw.<br/><br/>The showdown during the Cuban Missile Crisis is skillfully orchestrated and watching Magneto levitate a submarine out of the Gulf of Mexico is impressive.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman's profane cameo as Wolverine makes the movie and seals its continuity with the other ""X-Men"" epics."

First Class goes back to the very beginning of the story of Professor X and Magneto showing us their journey to friendship and destruction. The movie is technically a prequel but it more or less plays like a reboot so that it is very accessible to new viewers but still has several nods to the previous films that will keep fans interested. The movie brings back Bryan Singer(who directed the great X-men and terrific X2) as a producer and brings in Matthew Vaughn(of Kick-Ass and Stardust fame) as the director.

"pod-927-362493","9","6","11","5 June 2011"," An Honest Opinion for X Men First Class
","Firstly, this was the first X Men film I have seen. And boy, after watching it in the cinema, it sure did deliver beyond expectations. For some reason which I'm still not certain of, the X Men films never really did attract me, maybe because I thought it would just fall into the stereotype of traditional over rated Marvel releases that have you falling asleep because you feel like your watching the film for the sake of it. Back to the point, this film had me walking out of that cinema with a smile on my face so wide, the grand canyon would be put to shame. This wasn't a smile of ""oh that really entertained me"", no, because films are not for entertaining, but for gripping you and pulling you into that screen. This sure did that. Box ticked for sure. <br/><br/>Lets start with the cast, and wow, just brilliant. The relationship between each and every single member of the cast was just astonishing. This was because you could feel it, not just see it. I loved James McAvoy's performance of a dry sense of reserved humour backed up with that Oxford knowledge, which I believe gave him the edge over Michael Fassbender, who I must say should not be left in the dark. The sense of emotion was beaming from Magneto, maybe he does actually have magnetic powers, because he sure did attract me to his sense of feeling for those whose his character had lost. But of course, me being me, I do like a villain! Therefore I say, take a bow Kevin Bacon. For me, Kevin was my personal favourite from the film. His edge of darkness and sly character really carried a strong performance throughout. He really took centre stage with this and did not hold back on anything, his movement, voice and charisma just had me grinning all the way. He had everything a marvel bad guy should have. An evil background, arrogance, slyness, and of course, a really cool costume. Well, a really cool helmet which was taken from the latest NASA space shuttle. <br/><br/>Next, what else gripped me from this film was of course, the Directing of the cast. For this, I take my hat off to Matthew Vaughn. And from some reliable sources, ""he should have done the others"". And after seeing First Class, you can clearly see why. As the saying goes, he did exactly what it says on the tin, he did a first class job! This was because he did not play it out like the good guy catching the bad guy, he added levels which had the mind ticking over constantly. I found myself asking myself, what happens next, oh my gosh where will it go now, and stating I was not expecting that. And that is what a brilliant director does, he reaches out beyond that fourth wall and draws in the audience, making them feel a part of the story, getting them to look in all directions, keeping them guessing until that final scene.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm not a film critic. All of the above probably has no sense in it. I'm just trying to give an honest cinema going opinion of what I saw. And what I did see, was simply, amazing. It blew beyond all expectations, had me transfixed for the entire journey, had me smiling, wondering and enjoying. The choice of cast, which was strengthened by the bond of the young uniting to take down evil, lead with expert knowledge, took this film to the max. The screenplay with the thrilling and jaw dropping battle scenes in comparison to the one on one scenes which were intense yet heart felt had me feeling like this was worth the money. For a first time X Men viewer, this is a feature that is worthy of any audience and does everyone who took part proud, it is an outstanding achievement in the industry of film. Just brilliant."
"Vezon123","10","6","11","4 June 2011"," Man by nature is being tuned to a whole new categorical.
","In fact, the fact that the highest ratings of the movie titles with ""X-Men"" can not inspire the viewer, whose goal in going to the movies - a bucket of popcorn, cold ""Cola"" and lots of positive emotions directly from the spectacle, which he expects to receive . At the same time there were fears that the movie can be a tedious and cloying, especially after the promises made by Matthew Vaughn from the movie to make complicated mix of youth melodrama, like ""Twilight,"" and other things, that so typical of the summer blockbuster. However, all expectations after the scene display their talents Eric were some dull, useless, because the movie - it's not just action and melodrama, it is also an element of culture, an element that can, if desired to embody anything.<br/><br/>Rant on the topic of how good the story was not worth it, because he's really good, but no more. It has some inconsistencies and small plot ""appendixes, but they do not do anything wrong the general concept for how to write off all at the expense of"" the starting point ""and the fact that this film adaptation of comic books, comic books, moreover, is not the most famous Russian public, it turns pretty easy. No, nothing delusional and objectively excess is not observed, but difficult to call all of these plot moves riding genius. The script just fine. More precisely, even so: is simple, because even good.<br/><br/>Everything goes through some sort of unwritten plan, as usual, and I must say, very confidently. Sometimes even a thought that, come this tape years ago, eleven commercials, will it be now, if not universally accepted classics of the genre, or at least included in the list of his rules.<br/><br/>In ""First Class"" There is nothing flowery and, often, fills all the empty space. All lines are the heroes have a logical ending, and perhaps that's why nice to watch all this action. Yes, of course, who would be there that may say, but the pathos is also present, but, in fact, it strongly enough in comparison with many similar bands, and when it is, the characters seem even heartier, perhaps, may have even some on-screen life is waking up.<br/><br/>All this, of course, is not very easy and very pleasant to an eye a couple of James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender. Their duet looks as organically and naturally, because guys are not devoid of distinctive features and play their characters with great devotion, that neither can not affect the overall level of acting. Just a little surprised by the ease McAvoy, but this is the surplus of the image, not otherwise. Fassbender is, in fact, magnificent, and I say this almost without exaggeration. His image is powerful, hot, passionate and extremely interesting artistically.<br/><br/>Mummery excellent main characters and a good story canvas strengthened and that the action as the main driving element of most summer blockbusters, which, incidentally, ""X-Men"" could be considered with interest, looks almost the most minor details of the painting. Yes, everything is done at the highest level and the director of most scenes you can put a solid ""five"", but ""First Class"" is surprisingly skillfully won it on the feelings of the characters, not how beautiful or, conversely, they are operating their awful abilities.<br/><br/>In general, turned abruptly on all sides. Tape is without doubt a good and attractive, but in this case, probably all. It seeks not to be supersereznoy and raise topics that she does not pick up on the forces, and this is its main advantage. ""First Class"" - a reference sample of summer blockbuster, which must appeal to many. It's simple and delicious. In the film, there is nothing complicated and abstruse, and the curse for this Matthew Vaughn makes no sense. Bright, interesting, funny and very, very pleased to see the old-new characters in the new-old guise. Only Logan is not changed."

"blacklist-1","10","8","16","9 June 2011"," These X-Men live up to their title. It's first class all the way!
","Like many audience members of Hollywood cinema, I am a big fan of the X- Men franchise, despite having never read the comics. The first two films in 2000 and 2003 were massive hits and I loved them. But then tragically X-Men 3: The Last Stand made an unwelcome appearance on our screens in 2006. For me it was one of the worst superhero movies I had encountered and this is where like many franchises that do sequels, by the third most have been wrung out and I thought X-Men has run it's course. But then thankfully in 2009, director Gavin Hood decided to do a prequel of mutant Wolverine, which I really enjoyed and restored my faith in the franchise in what I thought was broken.<br/><br/>When initially I heard there was going to be a fifth X-Men with the origins of Magneto and Charles Xaiver I was excited and even more so when I heard it was a prequel/reboot, where after First Class, there is a commission for two more. I looked at the reviews on here and was taken aback at how hyped up this movie was. I will be honest I was a bit sceptical after recent films that I have seen at the pictures I have seen that have been hyped up and been for me highly over-rated, one being the terrible superhero movie Thor. <br/><br/>However I am more than pleased to say X-Men First Class lives up to it's reputation by the audience and fulfilled it's title by being first class all the way. I would say it is the best superhero movie of this year and arguably the best I have seen since Batman Begins (2005 and yes even better than The Dark Knight!). One thing I was very pleased about with this X-Men film is the choice of director Matthew Vaughn who from Kick-Ass appreciates that character substance and plot development is as important as the action sequences and special effects and X-Men First Class is the same. <br/><br/>Coming in at 132 minutes, Matthew Vaughn impressively has packed a lot in with the story that is balanced well consisting of different mutants coming together like Eric/Magneto (Michael Fassbender), Raven/Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence), Hank McCoy/Beast (Nicholas Hoult), Sean Cassidy/Banshee (Caleb Landry Jones) and Alex Summers/Havok (Lucas Till) headed by Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) who is supported by human CIA agent Moira MacTaggert (Rose Byrne). They are against the other mutants, who include Emma Frost (January Jones), Janos Quested/Riptide (Alex Gonzalez), Azazel (Jason Flemyng) and Angel Salvadore (Zoe Kravitz, who changes sides from Xavier's to Shaw's) who are headed by Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon). They have to stop him from using the Russians to start a war against humans by disguising it through the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962. Meanwhile another plot that is prevalent throughout is Eric's desire for revenge against Shaw who was his creator of his powers and who killed his mother with a sub plot of a potential romance between Raven and Beast.<br/><br/>The things that were great about this film that I expected was the superb special effects (I was also pleased that Vaughn decided not to do this in 3D), the action sequences were beautifully choreographed and were enormously destructive and exciting (though just as a little small gripe, I wish there had been a bit more action) and the script though basic did have flashes of wit with some nice comedy (with a small, but fantastic cameo appearance by Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, who gets a great one liner).<br/><br/>The biggest strength though is the character substance and plot development and the acting. The characters of all the different mutants are set up nicely as we learn about their different abilities and they all get their moments to shine. There are great performances across the board particularly by Bacon as Shaw who had a subtle but sharp malevolence, January Jones as Emma Frost and Jennifer Lawrence as Raven, but the driving force behind the plot development is Fassbender and McAvoy. They both give excellent performances as Xavier and Eric with some great chemistry on screen. You can clearly see the pain in Eric's eyes as he is consumed with his desire for revenge as all he has known all his life is pain and anger (which helps use his powers) in contrast to Xavier's (a comfortable and painless lifestyle who is smart and quick witted but with a gentle nature). <br/><br/>Throughout Vaughn cleverly distinguishes through the dialogue and actions of the two, the differing ideologies and objectives that they both contain as alliances are formed and broken and mutants switch sides. Throughout this divide is apparent as Eric tells Xavier that they as mutants will never be accepted by humans and that they should form their own society and rise to rid the world of humanity (mirroring Shaw's desires), whereas Charles wants to protect them and hopes one day they can co-exist side by side peacefully. The only reason Eric stays alongside Charles is to kill Shaw as they need to stop him. This divide in mutant/human existence ideology is cleverly mirrored in the sub-plot romance between Raven and Beast when Raven wants to be seen for who she is, but Beast wants to look normal like humans.<br/><br/>In the end Vaughn has created a film that will appeal to all who are new to the franchise and are loyal fans of the older films. He understands specifically what the audience expected and he delivered. And the fact he can intuitively guess what audiences wants is what I think partly makes this such a success. As I said they are going to make this prequel/reboot a new franchise and to that I say yes please as X-Men First Class is really that brilliant."
"griffolyon12","10","8","16","3 June 2011"," Forget the G-Men, these are the X-Men!
","Professor Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr (a.k.a Professor X and Magneto, for those not in the know), meet and become friends, then tragedy corrupts their unique relationship when mankind refuses to accept them for what they are. As it is, there are always two sides to the same coin. Erik carries a Nazi coin the entire movie, a memento that helps him remember his mother's killer; a nice touch by way of screen storytelling, giving us viewers a visual cue to remember the character's emotional anguish of watching his mother gunned down before his eyes. However, the coin that Erik and Charles reside upon flips up into the air at the end of this film, but this is not about which side the coin lands, but how we get there.<br/><br/>X-Men: First Class details the days before the X-Men, the days before Charles and Erik were known as Professor X and Magneto. These were the days that Charles was a silver spoon playboy, who is compassionate, but may be too cocky for his own good. Compare that to Erik, who grew up in a Nazi concentration camp to watch a mutant named Sebastian Shaw murder his mother before his eyes. Now, as a young man, Erik scours the globe to avenge his mother's death and kill Shaw. Yes, this is the 1960s! The Cuban Missile Crisis! A time of great divide, and at a point in American history, right before everything just kinda goes South. Sebastian Shaw is manipulating the Russians and the U.S. to start World War III, and Charles is recruited by the CIA to help create a mutant division and stop this war. With Erik's help, Charles trains many young mutants to make up this team, from Mystique, to a personal favorite of mine, Beast.<br/><br/>There is a sophistication to X-Men: First Class. Director Matthew Vaughn evokes the visual style of 1960s pop art in his direction, using kinetic visuals and fanciful camera movements to create a sense of being lead through this world, but never feeling as if we're being pushed. Vaughn in particular should be commended for being able to balance the dual origins of Charles and Erik, as it takes nearly the first half hour to finally see these two meet. The first thirty minutes jet all the way from Oxford, England, to Vegas, to Switzerland, to Argentina, Germany, and Rochester, New York. There are tons of stamps on the suitcase within the first act alone, but Vaughn makes the transitions smooth and natural, a feat that is hard to explain in words, but makes the difference upon viewing the film.<br/><br/>With an arc of revenge, Michael Fassbender gets the meatiest role to play as Erik, but to say that James McAvoy does not succeed as Charles would be incorrect as well. To be honest, Erik is the scene stealer of the entire movie. This is Magneto as he has never been seen before. For once the viewer does not see Magneto as a manipulator of the plans, but actually use his powers in action, as a soldier, an action hero who must find a place between peace and anger in order to truly master his powers. Seeing Charles trying to teach Erik how to master his powers, shows how these two characters develop such a memorable friendship, keeping up the mantra of the entire movie. There is very little told, it is always shown to us, making X-Men: First Class a visual masterwork, and a joy for escapist popcorn entertainment with the action exhilarating, and all of the cast looking as if they had fun (especially Kevin Bacon, knocking villain, Sebastian Shaw, out of the park).<br/><br/>With that all said, X-Men: First Class all boils down to being comfortable in one's skin and how should someone different approach being different in normal society. Should they hide being a mutant, or should they have mutant pride? This question has been the foundation of nearly all of the X-Men films, so this may not be new territory, but the examination of how Charles and Erik become Professor X and Magneto, is what this movie is truly about. The journey these two men go on is exciting, beautiful, and heartbreaking, making X-Men: First Class must see entertainment.<br/><br/>I give X-Men: First Class a 10 out of 10!"
"nagyistvanandor","3","9","19","12 June 2011"," The worst X-movie ever! Can't Hollywood get over of the Bat-effect?
","Ever since I stepped out of the cinema, something so did not felt right about the movie. I watched it in English too, and all though its cleared one of the things that did not made sense to me (In Hungarian there's a translation mistake, which makes it sound the William Stryker in First Class is the same how we meet in X-men origins: Wolverine and X-2, and not the Father of him.) But that was only a slight difference, and the others still remained there. I checked the Faq section of First Class and finally I got some answers, but totally not the type of answers I would have liked.<br/><br/>""Is ""First Class"" a prequel or reboot? It's both actually. First Class goes back to 1962, to a time before Charles Xavier and Erik Lehnsherr took the names Professor X and Magneto, making it a prequel in the X-Men franchise. However, there are changes in continuity because, as director Matthew Vaughn explains it, we ""were trying to reboot and start a whole new X-Men franchise and therefore, making a film work on its own two feet was far more important than trying to be referential to the prior movies."" . In short, First Class is an attempt to take the characters back to an earlier period (a prequel) from which future movies can be rebooted.""<br/><br/>So thats a replay to many of the things which did not feel right about X-men First Class. Personally to represent how I feel about this ""brilliant"" idea I would send Wolverines words to the Director and Story writers of First class. The ones he says when Charles and Eric approach him at the pub... <br/><br/>This fact alone blows down, 5 stars from the movie. Why the hack was there any need to reboot a great and developed tale? Dose Matthew Vaughn has a brain size of a peanut? and cant remember / keep in mind 4 movies? Not to do things which conflicts with the other movies? Or simply he just has zero Creativity and could not make up something, Like Hank Mccoy/Beast developed a machine which makes him able to look like a human for a period of time. //In X-2 we see him as a human. // Its don't even need to be genetic solution, a hologram or something could do that as well. Or for another example which got people confused in Wolverine movie... hint that the government toked blood sample from Emma Frost, which later on Stryker could use for his experiment, and the girl how we see in the end of the Wolverine movie, and claimed to be Silverfox sister aren't really Emma Frost, just a girl how Stryker experimented with.<br/><br/>So generally I would say First Class has a huge lack of story development. And the answer ""oh its a reboot so it doesn't need to match with the other movies"" don't make it a bit better, just even worst. <br/><br/>Over all the story wasn't so bad, quite watchable, if You can ignore the things I listed above. Acting was good, I cant complain to any of the actors. Visual effects was nicely made. But the concepts, and development of the movie is quite lame. I don't feel its a well though trough tale, no surprises like ""Oh i did not see that coming"". Its kinda showed what it should have shown, without creativity and lots of laziness... and ""oh its a reboot"" aren't an excuse. Thats whats makes X-men First Class The worst X-men movie ever, and makes it barely reach the line Watchable.<br/><br/>So like I say in the beginning of my review... Director and writers of X-men First class: Go F Your self's..."
"toastandcereal","2","7","14","19 September 2011"," Stupidly bad.
","I haven't read the comics (though I plan to) but I have watched all movies and enjoyed all of them. I was so looking forward to watching this movie, one of my friends who is a movie buff loved it a lot and understandably I wanted to see it as soon as I could.<br/><br/>I wish I hadn't wasted those two hours of my life. The whole movie feels like a Bond film, just like a lot of other people here have said. There's the classic Bond villain who wants to kill everyone without an actual explanation, his blonde sidekick who does everything he tells her to and looks like a Bond girl. The submarine with the hidden room is horribly Bond-like too. I can understand why Magneto wants to kill Shaw so much, anyone would want revenge, but this movie is just stupid. The movie cuts from Magneto being 12 years old in the war to 30 years old. What happened all that time? Was he just getting high, and steadily angrier about his mother's death? Also, I'm not sure if anyone else noticed this, but why did Magneto have to keep changing from English to American to German, and then randomly at the end, IRISH? I HATED the way Mystique just left her best friend who has loved her and cared for her most of her life, with a bullet in his spine, to go off and have adventures with Magneto. Just because you get bullied for being a 'freak' doesn't mean you leave your best friend on the floor potentially dying. It just goes to show how much the director of this film doesn't 'get' the X-Men story. The women in this film are all exploited as sexual animals, constantly in underwear or tight fitting clothes or short skirts. They all have to look perfect. I also didn't appreciate the comment one of the FBI men say at the end after the female FBI agent tells them about Xavier's kiss. He says 'This is why women shouldn't be allowed in the FBI' or something like that.<br/><br/>I hated the whole film, I truly feel like I've wasted 2 hours of my life. If you like this movie, you're an idiot. Simple as. It wasn't even boring, it's just that it was so bad that I wanted to throw my laptop at the wall. Download it for free if you're going to watch this crap."
"moviemavens","9","7","14","11 June 2011"," One of this decade's best superhero movies (http://themoviemaven.posterous.com)
","The original ""X-Men"" in 2000 propelled the meteoric rise of superheroes into the next decade and beyond. The first installment was followed up by a spectacular second, ""X2."" Unfortunately, the third, ""The Last Stand"" (with the change of director from Bryan Singer to Brett Ratner) fell flat. Crammed with too many characters, it's big on style and nothing else. ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" has its moments. Director Matthew Vaughn (""Layer Cake,"" ""Kick-Ass"") with Singer's return as a producer brings back the ""X-Men"" that fans worship.<br/><br/>""First Class"" is more of the origin story of the future Professor X (Patrick Stewart) and Magneto (Ian McKellen). They're young men learning about who they are, what they're capable of, discovering their superpowers and others like them, and where they stand in the world.<br/><br/>The story opens in Nazi's concentration camp, where metal-bending Erik Lehnserr (Michael Fassbender, ""Pride & Prejudice""), as a little boy, was separated from his family. Discovered as a mutant by a psychopathic doctor (Kevin Bacon), he's forced to mentally move a coin and fails, resulting in the tragic death of his mother. What follows is a terrifyingly powerful scene as Erik's power is unlocked by rage. He carries this deep-rooted anger to adulthood, turning into a vengeance-seeker and later a full-blown villain.<br/><br/>Telepathic Charles Xavier (James McAvoy, ""Wanted"") grows up in a sprawling, remote estate. One day he finds Raven/Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence), a shape-shifting blue mutant, masquerading as his mother in his kitchen. Since then they live together like brother and sister. There's a glimpse of their university days, where Charles is quite a charmer with the co-eds and eventually becomes a renowned professor in genetics mutation.<br/><br/>A CIA agent, Moira MacTaggert (Rose Byrne) stumbles upon the existence of mutants while in pursuit of Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon), which turns out to be the same Nazi doctor who killed Erik's mother. Sebastian is also a mutant, with the power to absorb and release energy force. He's accompanied by diamond-encrusted Emma Frost, twister-spinning Riptide, tailed devil Azazel.<br/><br/>An underwater incident leads Charles to Erik, where Charles saves his life. From then on their friendship grows. Erik's intensity is balanced by Charles' calming influence. They travel together to track down the other mutants - wing-sprouting Angel (Zoe Kravits), ear-splitting Banshee (Caleb Landry Jones), ape-like Beast (Nicholas Hoult), evolving Darwin (Edi Gathegi), fiery Havok (Lucas Till). Their relationships with the mutant proteges display their mentoring ability. The training at Charles' estate to control and manipulate their powers for good provides some of the lighthearted scenes.<br/><br/>Even with a common bond, Charles and Erik's ideological differences drive them apart. Charles believes that mutants and humans can co-exist peacefully, whereas Erik seeks to destroy for fear of being dominated.<br/><br/>With Sebastian playing the United States and Russian governments to start World War III, the world now discovers the mutants and their abilities during the showdown off the Cuban coast. Erik is most powerful with Charles' assistance when he can find that place mentally between rage and serenity. Sebastian meets his demise in a fitting fashion.<br/><br/>Once the missile crisis is averted, however, the humans, united by the fear of the unknown, turn against the mutants. With Erik out of control, Charles tries everything in his power to turn around the situation. Charles is struck and ends up paralyzed. The moment comes when the mutants, influenced by their own personal experiences, must choose side in determining the future of the human race.<br/><br/>The retro design and archival news footage provide ""First Class"" an authentic feel. It's unfortunate that it's missing a few of the main mutants; most notably Wolverine, Storm, Cyclops, Jean Gray. If you blink, you'd miss a surprising cameo or two.<br/><br/>It's a thrill to see the superb special effects be put into exhilarating use; the interesting mix of superpowers, an anchor ripping off a ship, submarine and missiles suspended in the air. But that's not what makes ""First Class"" a real first class. It's a lot more than good versus evil. The dynamics of Charles and Erik's intense friendship, underlined by solid acting, is the strongest point. The genuine human emotions and implications - rage, pain, agony, fear, isolation and longing - to be ""normal,"" to be tolerated for being different and be accepted in society are the pillars of the story.<br/><br/>An extraordinary blast from the past, ""X-Men: First Class"" will go down as one of this decade's best superhero movies!<br/><br/>The MovieMaven (http://themoviemaven.posterous.com)"
"mego_spillane1234","9","7","14","3 June 2011"," Seriously just watch this film!
","Okay when treking to the cinema to see this please bear in mind that it was the third time i'd been in a week. I needed something to do so off I treked to see x-men. I thought the first two in the series were good but come on the last stand was actually shameful and wolverine wasn't exactly a masterpiece. So although I expected to enjoy it I wasn't expecting that much..<br/><br/>The film was far better than I expected, I mean i should have guessed really Vaughn is a pretty good director (stardust is a secret fave of mine). Its refreshing to have wolverine out of the way with only a quick cameo, I mean what is everyones obsession with him anyway! James Macavoy is charming, I found myself dreading the moment when he loses the power to walk far more than I should have.Fassbender is also great, and both men make you forget that two of the worlds greatest actors have previously played them. The action is intense and there's more than enough to satisfy anyone. The effects were also pretty good especially when the beast becomes full on blue, as much as I missed Hoults incredibly cute face, he also looked great in blue.<br/><br/>The standout for me was Lawerence as Mystique, she was great and brang substance to an important role. I've never really liked the character before but now I'm seeing her in a different light. Bacon is a crafty villain with a cool white interiored submarine but I seriously thought he was going to start dancing (i recently watched footloose for about the 50th time).<br/><br/>Okay the films not perfect but its pretty good, Jones as Emma Frost was underused and the screen felt a bit overcrowded at times because there literally tons of mutants. But I'd say it's one of my fave so far this year, well way better than water for elephants thats for sure! btw i have spent a lot of time since i saw this movie attempting to move various metal objects with my hands and have sadly failed."
"son_of_cheese_messiah","3","5","9","28 August 2014"," David Cameron assembles the C-(list) Men
","X-Men: First Class is a typically slick product of modern Hollywood; well made in its own way, but rather flat. It is one of those films that the more you think about it, the worse it becomes. Things happen because they look 'cool' in the moment rather than make sense.<br/><br/>Nice to see what David Cameron was up to in his Bullindon Club days before he became UK Prime Minister. James McAvoy does an astonishingly good impersonation of him, only more slippery and creepy, if that's possible. But it seems to undermine the great Professor X that he should be using his telepathy to seduce girls, something of a low trick and one that cannot be merely dismissed as youthful high jinks. Perhaps he should call himself Professor Sex instead.<br/><br/>I can certainly see why fans of the comic are appalled by the lack of fidelity to the original but I can also see why the film makers would want to go their own way. It is amazing, however, that they would choose such a crew of c-listers (with a few z-listers), some of whom are very little known even among comic fans. And like many badly written films, it leaves more questions than answers.<br/><br/>Why was Havok chosen in preference to his brother Cyclops? Who are Angel and Darwin? <br/><br/>Considering this is a PG-13, isn't the level of violence very disturbing, especially the slo-mo murder of Sebastian Shaw at the end, but also the indiscriminate killing of humans in the compound? Why would Shaw take the time and trouble to break into the compound, mass murdering people, say to the mutants ""you're either for us or against us"" then leave with only one mutant (the feeblest one at that) leaving these potential enemies alive? He even makes it even worse by killing one of them for little reason thus angering the rest? <br/><br/>Why for that matter is the one black character in the film seem there merely to be killed off as quickly as possible? He seems to go unmourned by the x-men as do the humans in the compound. Why is the potential massacre of sailors at the end seen as worse than this actual massacre in the compound which the X-men do nothing about? <br/><br/>Why does Mystique walk away from her oldest friend (Professor X) when he's just been crippled? It probably says a lot for the banality of the script that just about the last line in the film is David Cameron saying ""I can't feel my legs""."
"chaos-rampant","Null","5","9","10 September 2011"," No class
","Say, you wanted to see a bunch of sketches that explain the X-Men as we've come to know them; how Magneto came by the helmet, what threw Xavier on the wheelchair, a bunch of ironic reversals about who sides with who as eventually the deck is stacked. You will probably have a good time.<br/><br/>Everything else is mostly dismal. When the arch-nemesis warns a bunch of fresh-cut mutants they are going to be 'enslaved' by the human majority, the filmmaker cuts to a close-up of the one among them who is black. It's this much without class, without some finesse. For the entire movie we fly back and forth; from Vegas, where the ideal place for the lavish, secret hideout - accessed no less by a revolving couch - is adjucent to a strip joint, to the 'concealed CIA base' that is a dozen acres covered with buildings that look like CIA. Or freely, magically transported outside the home of a Soviet general only there to be reminded that our presence could light the fuse of another world war.<br/><br/>It is James Bond stuff at best. Like with James Bond, the filmmakers attempt to infuse some credulity to the comic-book shenanigans by situating them inside swathes of history that hold some familiarity and allure. So, everything is hastily crammed inside the box that reads Cold War history. There are ex-Nazis hiding out in Latin America - with a veiled reference to Colonia Dignidad. The climax is a liberal enactment of the Cuban missile crisis.<br/><br/>Oh, we're served again with 'us and them' trite dilemmas, as in all the previous X-Men films. There are people who are understanding, awe-struck before the mysterious powers, but a handful of them; most are ignorant dumbasses or the scheming scum we have come to understand populate the upper echelons of the military - secret government aristocracy.<br/><br/>What is basically left, is the noisy, effect-laden attractions; watch this because you can't think of a better movie where a submarine is lifted out of the water."

"bennyhagen","2","8","17","10 June 2011"," Uncool.
","X-Men: First Class pushes the envelope by further developing the present form of mainstream crap. The ""phylosophical themes"" featured by this talky little movie consist exclusively of stupid commonplace and the banal scenes illustrating the concept of separation and such run on kindergarten level. As a wise man once said: ""If you have nothing to say then just shut the f+*k up"". And yet again, not shown to you, like, visually, but talked about and explained verbally. Similar to Venezuelan soap opera. Let me just hand out a big f/ckyou here.<br/><br/>Characters are superficial and underdeveloped. Except of somewhat competent James McAvoy actors seem uninspired. Dialog matches daytime drama standards and worse. Superpowers are just not cool and the visual execution seriously lacks fantasy. The fact that almost everything you see here has already been done in the previous x-men movies and in much cooler ways lets me reshape into a question mark. Visual design also lacks fantasy, some of it is horrible. The work of the department responsible for the make-up effects is atrocious, Beast and Mystique look like muppets. Here goes the other f*ckyou.<br/><br/>Despite a Wolverine cameo logical connections to the former trilogy are missing completely. I didn't know this was a reboot but however, the question emerges, why rebooting something that has been decently executed before (let's forget about X3 for a minute here). Why destroying the former movies and make something even more remote to the comics? Surely it has to do with money, so let's bow before the gods of marketing.<br/><br/>People in the cinema seemed to like it, I guess they found it awesome and intelligent. I have no doubt that anti-intellectual sh-*/t like this will continue setting standards and increasingly shape upcoming movies in it's own image as box office numbers show it is well matched to the demands of it's audience.<br/><br/>2/10<br/><br/>Whatever talented, passionate people might have accomplished throughout movie-making history, most successful production will always be the WWF."
"jedi-jones","5","8","17","5 June 2011"," One Quick Rewrite and This Could Be an X-Spoof
","You know there's a problem when you start making up MST3K-style gags in the middle of a movie. X5 has a good opening sequence and goes steadily downhill from there. There is some solid acting and a couple of exciting scenes, but the plot gets more implausible and the characters more laughable with each passing moment. Eventually you realize you're not going to see anything new, that this is as predictable as the typical prequel, and that your time is best spent making up jokes.<br/><br/>It's not good when the most memorable image from the movie is Kevin Bacon wearing Magneto's helmet. This is not something that longtime X-Fans have been dying to see on the big screen as far as I know. Aside from the decidedly unthreatening helmet, Bacon would have been a better villain if he spoke with a German accent the whole time as he did in the introduction. The filmmakers forgot a basic rule of pulp films which is that foreign accents equal villainy.<br/><br/>They also forgot another rule of comic book movies, which is that ""comic panel""-style scenes are stupid, as Ang Lee's Hulk demonstrated. Yeah, we get it, this is based on a comic book. We don't need to be hit over the head with it. They also spent too much time focusing on how the characters' names get made up, a now tiresome comic book movie cliché.<br/><br/>Other than Xavier, Magneto and Mystique's story lines, which are largely rehashed from the previous films, there's almost nothing that works as drama here. The march to Nuclear War was as contrived as I've ever seen that done. I honestly think Superman IV did a better job by just having Lex sneak up and push the launch button himself. X5 asks us to believe that all you have to do to start nuclear war is threaten/buy off/seduce two generals (or whoever). As if neither countries' presidents nor other officials have any say in the matter, but are just puppets of these two guys. The powers-that-be then do stuff that's so despicable, Professor X looks like a dolt for continuing to have faith in humanity. It brings to mind Dark Helmet's point about evil always triumphing because good is dumb.<br/><br/>More rehashing comes when this movie sloppily shoehorns in a redo of the ""cure"" subplot from X3. Beast claims he can normalize his appearance yet retain his powers. But since his powers are a physical ability caused by his body being in the mutated shape that it is, what he says makes absolutely no sense.<br/><br/>First Class also suffers from the old ""Submarine Crew"" problem of having a bunch of characters that are necessary to perform functions in the story, but are woefully underdeveloped. Half the characters here serve no purpose other than to be special effects. I think even Professor X realizes his new recruits are disposable, since he almost kills one of them in some reckless training exercises without giving it a second thought. The movie signals that it doesn't consider the new characters important by putting together an extremely slapdash special effects sequence to introduce them.<br/><br/>Then there's the ""Batman Begins"" problem of running out of decent new characters to introduce since they're up to the 5th movie already. Hence we end up with a ""G.I. Joe: The Movie (1987)"" Big Lob-esque mutant who has the strangest, most inexplicable and illogical power since Spider-Man's spider sense...at least the version that was so sensitive it could warn Spidey if he wrote a bad check. His power to basically ""do anything he needs to do when he needs to do it"" strains credibility as much as it induces humor. There's usually something off about new characters written into an adaptation that weren't vetted through the normal channels the pre-existing characters were. If you recall, Big Lob's great military specialty in G.I. Joe was that he could dribble grenades like a basketball, or something.<br/><br/>Worse yet, every somewhat interesting new character is dispensed with perfunctorily. Instead of having a big psychic face-off between White Queen and Xavier as a change of pace from shooting, kicking and punching, she's all but forgotten about. Much more could have been made of the human allies of the mutants, but the Bill Richardson-esque CIA agent and Moira basically vanish after they perform their duty in the plot, one of them in the most anticlimactic way since what happened to Xavier in X3.<br/><br/>Let's also consider X-Stripper, whose power is that she can give you one hell of a ""buzz"" in the champagne room. She makes me question the strategy of rounding up every single mutant to create this elite task force. Let's say there was a mutant who had the power to pass enough gas to stink up an entire aircraft carrier. Would they want him on the team too?<br/><br/>There remain lingering questions. How do the X-Men operate their jet without being shot down? How does Beast single-handedly build the thing in the first place? Exactly what happens to all the energy that one character absorbs at one point? I feel like I was cheated out of a big explosion here. How exactly would Xavier pull off eluding the CIA? Shouldn't he set up shop outside a Pakistani military base to be more inconspicuous?<br/><br/>This movie is ridiculous enough that with one slight nudge it could become a raucous comedy. One mistake was not deflating some of the hot air by putting more humor in the movie. There's only one funny line and few attempts to create any kind of comic relief. This series needs to lighten up. Or at least do something different. That didn't happen here. People are going to get sick of comic book movies if they keep showing us the same movie they've already shown us twenty times before (no thanks to you, Harry Potter, for popularizing this idea). It also helps when these movies make sense."

","It definitely got the action right, and it's so loaded with fancy mutant superpowers that any X-Men fan will surely love it. The pacing is good, both directing and acting are decent, and overall it does have the potential to deliver a great deal of entertainment to sci-fi and action lovers. Unfortunately, it's also pretty far from a perfect film. The plot is predictable, the scriptwriting is extremely cheesy, and several themes were copied directly from X-Men (2000) and X2 (2003). Predictable? Given that it's a prequel the ending is bound to be given, but when everything until then is about equally obvious, the narrative clearly has a problem. Cheesy? This film has so many so awkwardly unnatural and over-the-top dramatic lines it's almost physically painful to watch at times. Unoriginal? The fact that the entire background for Erik is based on the same themes as the background for Wolverine as presented in X2, and that this background defines the recurring themes of First Class speaks for itself. The thing that bothered me the most, though, was that the film encompassed so many interesting stories and managed to connect them and properly attach them to the main story - but that it constantly felt like it never got the chance to actually explore any of them sufficiently to make them more than superficial add-ons. Could it be that what the narrative here really needed was less action, less superpowers, and more emphasis on the actual characters?"

","Saw this on the day it came out. The local Cinema was packed with audiences, though sadly not for this but perhaps fans of Pirates and Kung Fu Panda 2. Which is a shame as this more darkly comic, brutal and engaging sequel is more than what the 4th instalment of the Pirates' films has promised.<br/><br/>This film has the subtle whit, the daring and brutal action (coin scene), emotion, character development and welded plot that is required from these types of superhero/comic films. This film succeeds where the rushed complexion of X3 and Wolverine: X-Men Origins left us feeling hollow.<br/><br/>This film is most on par with X2 (X-Men 2/X-Men United), exceeding X1 and surely exceeding X3 and Wolverine combined. <br/><br/>The real stars are James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender as the brilliant Charles Xavier (Prof. X) and elusive Erik Lensherr (Magneto) respectively. They play the parts will similar presence and calibre of their former counterparts Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen. They reinvigorate the characters adding further depth, energy and a likability which allows us to develop an affection for them and we become sympathetic to Magneto especially as he deals with internal demons and the power he releases. <br/><br/>Kevin Bacon' Sebastian Shaw as the central villain really is a surprise. He pulls it off excellently with good amount of Machiavellian manipulation and power, which stems the actions of Magneto. He doesn't do internal monologues or make some small evil scheme feel like a grandiose escapade, to quote a beloved character from ""The Dark Knight"", 'some men, just want to watch the world burn' by initiating WW3. As well as being a period piece, the backdrop of the Cuban Missile Crisis and the intense climate of fear and paranoia driving the countries leaders is well told. Very much akin to Alan Moore's Watchmen and subsequent 2008 film by Zack Snyder. Additional to him is the femme fatale, right-hand woman, January Jones' Emma Frost who can rival Prof. X. She provides an excellent performance, chivalry is definitely not dead. The young mutant cast is an ensemble of likable, learning kids who get thrown into the mix very early on. The key themes identified were Acceptance and Dominance; Prof X and Magneto. Conflicting ideals that sometimes meet head on and diverge violently. <br/><br/>Matthew Vaughn didn't herald much of the creative ideas of this film, as the hand of Bryan Singer is felt in the control of plot and character development. But regardless, there IS character development! Dir. Matthew Vaughn has pulled off a excellent superhero summer action film with enough endeavours and allegorical metaphors to keep us busy. It doesn't feel too Bryan Singer-esqe but it feels rejuvenated with a much more mature sense of style. <br/><br/>Overall - 8.5/10<br/><br/>I have to watch this again."

","Seriously. Where are all the good reviews coming from? Yeah it was cool to see Xavier and Magneto as young people. Yeah the Cold War storyline was interesting and had a ton of potential. Unfortunately, that potential was utterly squandered in an absolute mess of sloppy filmmaking. <br/><br/>Rather than write a long-winded, critical essay, I'll just make a list of the awfulness:<br/><br/>1. Plot holes big enough to drive an aircraft carrier though. So Xavier has equipment that allows him to find mutants all over the country. And he finds a group of dumb, undisciplined kids with powers of varying uselessness. Dragonfly-stripper-girl? Really? <br/><br/>2. Absolutely useless and insulting cameo by Wolverine. In the horrible montage in which Xavier and Magneto go out searching for the useless mutants, they come across Wolverine sitting at a bar, who tells them to 'f*ck off' before they can get two words out, at which point they just turn right around and walk out. You'd think that they'd at least TRY to convince the one mutant on their list who has extensive military training and sharply-honed instincts to join them. And since Xavier has these telepathic abilities, he'd know that Wolverine is also involved with another secret military operation, a fact which juuuuuust might be of some use to him as he builds his team and looks for resources. <br/><br/>3. They fly around in a modified SR-71 with a big internal passenger bay and the ability to hover. Really? I know they're going for a period vibe, but they couldn't come up with something original instead of insulting our intelligence by using a famous aircraft design and bastardizing it in the most ridiculous way possible?<br/><br/>4. Horrible CGI effects. Seriously, were the CGI guys from Babylon 5 the only ones available?<br/><br/>5. Kevin Bacon. As a Nazi war doctor. Need I say more?<br/><br/>6. Completely implausible and insulting reasons for Magneto and Mystique to flip on Xavier. Especially Mystique. <br/><br/>7. The fight between the mutants is probably the worst combat scene ever put on film. Literally.<br/><br/>8. Did I mention Kevin Bacon? Yeah, because he and January Jones also start the Cuban Missile Crisis. <br/><br/>9. 1950's period setting is completely phony and feels totally tacked on. <br/><br/>There's probably a lot more, but this is just what leaps to mind immediately. It was really THAT bad. I'm giving it four stars because the director managed to keep the boom microphones out of all the shots, and the camera upright. Also January Jones has a spectacular rack and the chick that played Mystique was cute as well."
"zak-jftj","4","4","7","30 June 2011"," Don't know if i needed to see the other films to get it but...
","I base a good film on three things: a good story line, good acting and/or lots of impressive action. I guess the good acting may not in itself make a film good but it certainly helps.<br/><br/>I started watching it and for the first ten or so minutes i thought ah this looks like it might be a good film, although possibly slightly confusing. The acting in this first part seemed mostly solid so i give it 7/10. However, as the film continued the plot seemed to become increasingly simplistic and predictable causing it to be very dull. The story dragged out with moments that lasted far too long and scenes that seemed like they were only there to make the film a length worth watching for the increasingly ridiculous cinema prices.<br/><br/>Other than the first section the acting seemed mostly weak with no particular stand out characters. I never really thought that i had a connection with or felt emotion for any of the characters apart from at the beginning. I thought that Dr. Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) was the only exception as he seemed to have a solid set of lines and he played the part well<br/><br/>Finally the action element was the joint weakest with the plot. There was very little action with odd spouts of poorly choreographed violence. I thought that Havok (Lucas Till) looked like a badly mimicked iron man that wasn't nearly as cool. The action scene near the end was, i thought, a shambolic, disorganised mess. It seemed very anti-climatic and given that it's a superhero movie the action is what most people will go to see it for.<br/><br/>So overall given that the movie doesn't fulfill any of the above criteria I must say that the film was a disappointment because it could have been so much better. I have, however noticed that the majority of the other reviews have been very positive. I cannot imagine how this is possible other than if they are all avid followers of the x-men series. The only other reason is that there could have been several things that this film explained, answered or linked about the last films that were as of yet unanswered which made it a good film. If this is true please feel free to make me aware of it. As this was the first x-men film I have seen I realise that it may have been beneficial to see the previous ones so therefore I cannot really advise those people who have seen the others in the series but to the ones that haven't I would personally save your money for Transformers which is a significantly better film for those looking for a true action superhero movie. For these reasons I give it a rating of 4/10"

","I went to see this movie based on the IMDb rating of 8.3! Rarely do we see a title with such a high rating so it must really really good right? Right from the start of the movie the story is completely irrelevant to what the X-Men (and women) are, and I mean completely, it went on and on for about 20 minutes and the topic kept on re-emerging throughout the movie until the end, the guilt and the guilty, the revenge, etc... No spoiler here don't worry. This movie franchise has clearly been hijacked by a group of people that not only don't know how to make movies are terrible at writing scripts and worse at casting. The only person that saved this movie is James McAvoy, everyone else's acting might as well fit out of a teen/pre-teen TV show basically, even Kevinv Bacon was no convincing, I found myself looking around for an exit sign.<br/><br/>What happened to the Hugh Jackman and Halle Berry caliber? This movie is so cheap and so disappointing from start to end."

"reeseslightning","4","3","5","20 September 2011"," Mediocre Fun *slight spoilers*
","Overall, I could've really enjoyed this movie but there are too many confusing points. *minor spoilers*<br/><br/>First, let's go over what annoyed/confused me:<br/><br/>1. The ending. <br/><br/>Okay, we all know that Professor X is paralyzed eventually. Yet, in this film, he's supposed to be paralyzed at a young age but in X-Men: The Last Stand, he's seen walking with Magneto to Jean Grey's house and in X-Men: Wolverine, he's standing by the plane as the mutants come from the building. So which one is it?<br/><br/>2. Mystique and Professor X grew up together???? <br/><br/>Where on earth did that come from? For two people who were so close in their youth/young adulthood, I find that to be yet another inconsistency that takes away from the story. The whole time I could only think, ""Why does Professor X and Magneto have such a complicated bromance in the first trilogy if they knew each other for only a few weeks, but there is zero mention of Mystique and Professor X when they've known each other their whole lives?"" <br/><br/>3. Um, what happened to the lifelong friendship between Professor X and Magneto? <br/><br/>In X-Men: The Last Stand, we see Professor X and Magneto are seen as still friends because they go to together to Jean Grey's house. Yet, the ending shows that the pair's friendship ended on the beach in 1962.<br/><br/>4. Emma Frost<br/><br/>I get January Jones' character in the film. Really, I do. Every film needs its cliché blonde bombshell that does nothing except run around in skimpy clothes. But! Wasn't Emma Frost in X-Men: Wolverine as a 17 yr old (give or take a year)? What happened to her sister? What happened to her after she was caught by Professor X and Magneto?<br/><br/>There are too many loose ends and not enough answers to questions that have been raised.<br/><br/>Okay, now let's get to the good points:<br/><br/>1. Michael Fassbender and James McAvoy in the same movie? Yay!!!! To me, Michael Fassbender can do no wrong and the casting of these two were brilliant. <br/><br/>2. Miscellaneous.<br/><br/>Okay, the special affects were super cool(except Emma Frost's diamond effect is way different than in Origins) and the mutants were pretty awesome. Granted, I know these names are supposed to mean something, but I never got a chance to know them due to the massive amount of rushing through the story lines. <br/><br/>3. Cameos<br/><br/>There were several nice surprises from Hugh Jackman to Rebecca Romajin. They added a little something familiar to the story, even if they were totally unnecessary and added to the confusion of the timeline (Wolverine).<br/><br/>Overall, I liked the movie. But if the writers had actually watched the original trilogy and thought through the connections, I'm sure it would have been even better. I liked the casting, but the actual storyline went from an origin story, to a story that resembled a learning community(meaning, we got to see Professor X actually help these mutants and we saw them bond), to a cliché 'let's foil the villainous take over the world plan' and then rushed back to a 'this is why the x men/brotherhood have a love/hate relationship' story.<br/><br/>It could've been so much better if they had focused one of the three story lines. Personally, I found the best part of the movie was watching Xavier work with the mutants. They should have taken a different, less confusing road with the ""First Class"" idea. <br/><br/>I gave it 4 stars because the parts I did like, were brilliantly done but everything else came between them and ruined the fun. Now, I'm left scratching my head trying to piece together the connections."
"BenceHartl","6","3","5","4 September 2011"," Mediocre action movie with several embarrassing moments
","Everything went wrong with the X-men movies when Bryan Singer decided to stop directing them. The first X-men film was an amazing picture with excellent cast and superb directing despite the lower budget. X2 was even better, larger, deeper than the first one. Then Brett Ratner and the producers managed to screw a great story with just simply wrong timing and cutting and unnecessary rewritings of the script. I don't even mention Wolverine which was a mediocre Hollywood trash on the level of Daredevil or Elektra.<br/><br/>The story here in X-men - First Class is not bad, you can feel that Bryan Singer had some ideas during the writing session. But the final result is very, very disappointing. We have a lot of interesting characters here but no time for a reasonable dialog between them. The young versions of our admired heroes are saying the silliest lines - repeatedly! - to each other with harsh, annoying, nonstop score in the background. The viewer has the feeling that it's just a two our long trailer of some summer blockbuster-wannabe - and I know it was meant to be a summer blockbuster but after the first two episodes I was expecting much-much more from this franchise.<br/><br/>Matthew Vaughn is an otherwise extremely talented director, I love all his previous movies but this is lack of any of his virtues. Maybe the ironic view or the humor is missing here which he had before in Stardust or Kick/Ass. X-men is probably not that franchise where you can turn things to a grotesque, sarcastic direction, Vaughn tries it a couple of times and he usually fails. (There are some scenes that are supposed to be funny.) Okay, and what about being cool? Layer Cake is one of the coolest movies ever made, but that also can be said about X-men and X2. Well, this movie is unfortunately not cool at all. Maybe it tries too hard to be cool but this huge effort to overdo everything makes it undignified and embarrassing.<br/><br/>The cast is superb though. It's nice to see that the producers had some money for the actors too not just for the action sequences. James McAvoy is great as always, Michael Fassbender is a perfect young Magneto, he just has some stupid lines and he can't do anything with them. But we have here the amazing Kevin Bacon, the very talented Jennifer Lawrence (watch Winter's Bone instead of this film), the coolest chick of the picture: January Jones (in a very silly costume - most of the costumes were probably borrowed from the wardrobe of Kick/Ass) and such great actors as Michael Ironside for insignificant tiny roles. Sadly, the script doesn't make an opportunity for any of these great actors to do something memorable.<br/><br/>Well, at least the action sequences are pretty spectacular. However, there's nothing you haven't seen before in the earlier movies - or in somewhere else.<br/><br/>Briefly: X-men - First Class is a mediocre Hollywood trash with wasted talents, ruined ideas and nice action sequences. Enjoy if you can."
"DarkVulcan29","9","3","5","3 June 2011"," Puts the X in excellent.
","Like Star Wars and Star Trek, now it's the X-Men turn to get a back story.<br/><br/>The story takes in place in 1962, a young college student named Charles Xavier(James McAvoy), before he was known has Professor Xavier, is asked by Morina MacTaggert(Rose Byrne) to help figure out an evil mutant named Sebastian Shaw(Kevin Bacon) and his crews plan. Charles befriends a troubled mutant named Erik Lennsher(Michael Fassbender), before he became known has Magneto, He and Charles recruits other mutants, but will they all be able to be a step ahead of Shaw? <br/><br/>An improvement over X-Men:Origins Wolverine. The effects are incredible, so are two surprised cameos, by whom I won't say. McAvoy and Fassbender give descent performances. So does Kevin Bacon as the villain, he just really gets under your skin. I liked the back story, and the 60's setting. A true delight for X-Men fans."
"m-ark11","1","22","68","3 June 2011"," Worst movie ever
","I went and saw this movie on opening night because I love the X-Men, unfortunately my favorite comic series let me down tonight. First Class was the worst movie I've ever seen. First off, the acting was terrible. I was extremely disappointed by all the characters' acting except Magneto. Secondly the script, dialog, and directing were completely mundane and inept. The lines were stupid and poorly written. A 3rd grader could have written a better script than that. The directing didn't make any sense. Halfway through the movie the camera goes into this split frame view showing each of the characters four times at once that just made me think that the director was screwing with people.<br/><br/>All in all, I would not recommend anyone goes and sees this movie. In fact you would have to pay me to see it, and if I would have known it was going to be so bad I would have definitely not paid for it."

I watched based on its IMDb Ratings ..BUT please stop these fake posters trying to prop up a horrible film ...it makes the Rating system useless for Users actually looking for a good film !!! where do we start ? The characters are nowhere like the Comic books ..first class? wasn't that suppose to be Iceman, Cyclops, Beast. Angel and Marvel Girl/Jean Grey? Now we have Mystique - a step sister of Xavier, Havok Alex summers the younger brother of Cyclops in the comics actually old enough to be his grandfather ..Banshee and Moira McTaggert are American?? ha? ...it's like lets cash in on the X-Men name and just find cool powers and use and abuse them without any respect for the original characters ... You could almost forgive this if th movie were good but ...<br/><br/>Second - how cheesy is the acting, how wooden are the characters and how by the book and unoriginal are the script Also if anything needs a REBOOT ..it isn't Spider-Man ..it's this whole FOX X-Men series ..it stinks and its all over the place. Hell it doesn't even tie with properly with the later X-Men trilogy properly as characters are all over the place in age and years and how they met.An example is when Xavier was looking through Cerebro and we see a young Storm ...well X-Men was suppose to be 2000, Storm here looks about 6yrs in the 60s meaning Storm is at least in her 40s in the X-Men trilogy which she clearly is NOT !!..not to mention this whole Cyclops/Havok relationship among other things Marvel needs to get back their characters like Spider-Man, Fantastic Four (another cheese) and X-Men from FOX studios who make a habit of totally raping their characters.

"afrodisiac_spell","Null","4","8","30 August 2011"," Lack of personality this movie is..
","It's entertaining yes..for the eyes especially. It's the only reason why I give it 4 stars instead of 1. To spend the next 120 minutes with super power hero versus villain kind of action, then this movie is acceptable. But to be called as the prequel of the X-Men? Don't think so..<br/><br/>I kept on wondering on the first place after I've done watching this movie, what's missing? And I found what's was missing, through some quite genuine reviews from some of the honest intelligent reviewer (and perhaps whose truly a big fans of X-Men).<br/><br/>The whole story is lack of personality, and especially the characters. Quoting one's comments (Sasson's I think): ""X-MEN was never, at it's very core and it's most fundamental message- a one-man show. X-men in many of it's incarnations, celebrated unity and celebrated TRUE friendship & camaraderie"" Looking at the character, you just won't feel any connection, emotional attachment kind of feelings (despite the fact that the movie was trying to bring out such a heavy topic as ""accepting your self""). Some character just pop-out (and even die in instance), for no meaning at all. There's no teamwork, no moral questioning (instead we're being directed that this one is good, that one is bad), it's just plain and shallow.<br/><br/>A bunch of teenage with super power are gathered around the world (or it's just America?), and suddenly they all friends with each other?? Don't they have their own personal issue? What it seems to me, they all just instantly click with each other, hang around together, showing off their ""super-power"" abilities, making it looks like a totally cheap suck-off powers.<br/><br/>You totally can't relate to the characters, that you won't even regret when one of the character is dead. Taking one extreme example, what's the ""butterfly girl"" so called as Angel character is actually gone for? Well, yes she got the curvy body, and beautiful dragonfly kind of wings (not mention her acid saliva), but then what? Suppose if this character being taken off from the movie, it won't affect the storyline whatsoever.<br/><br/>Some of the reviewer says that the CGI effects was lame. I think it's not pure lame, but maybe lack of artistic touch. I've seen Raven shape-shifting her body like so many times in this movie, but it's nothing artistic about the shape-shifting scene. She would just, literary deformed in instance along with those blue spiky things going around her body.<br/><br/>I remember watching the first sequel of X-Men, and being fascinated by the way Mystique transform her body. With silhouette, camera move slowly following her transformation. That's what I called artistic, not just a plain effect on the eye! In the end, I just don't understand how this movie get's reviewed with such a high score in IMDb. I shouldn't really trust all the reviewer in here (is it possible that they're being paid to write??) as you shouldn't trust plainly on this review. But go ahead, watch the movie, and see if it's actually true what I've written in here (along with some other ""genuine"" reviewer who not hesitate to give the 1 star score).<br/><br/>Sorry for any grammatical error, English was never my mother-tongue anyway^^"

","I didn't expect anything from this movie. I was 100% sure it was a very low budget spin-off with almost no advertising. I didn't want to spend 8,50  (x2) to go to see it in theater. Anyway I was forced to, mostly because there was no room for ""Transformers 3"". Let me point out that I'm a comic book maniac/reader/collector so I watched every comic book related movie by far. I have to admit that this one is the best I've ever seen. The reason? it is a STORY, with characters, thoughts, dialogues and so on... It's not a blow-up-everything summer blockbuster, but a very well played drama. If you liked chris claremont's x-men, where the action was the last part of the stuff you'll LOVE this movie. Michael Fassbender (Magneto) and James McAvoy (Xavier) perfectly fit their roles. Even Kevin Bacon is perfect as Sebastian Shaw. And what about Mystica? I think she's waaay better than rebecca romjin stamos from the first 3 movies... OK she's less hot, I must admit it, but After this movie I consider her a better actress than the model rebecca. some side notes: - as a comic book fan the most notable thing to remember is that x-men have their blue/yellow original costumes. And they rock! - I'm very interested in history (I mean, general history - the one you study in school), so I think that the part regarding Magneto's background and cold war is really well done - as an architect I have to say that rooms, furniture, and design objects are perfect. The guys who worked at the settings earned their pay.<br/><br/>Did you remember Elektra or ghost rider? well, the times have changed.

"jboothmillard","8","4","8","22 June 2011"," X-Men: First Class
","The Marvel X-Men franchise has really grown since the first film, three original films, a prequel for Wolverine, and now this prequel seeing possibly the two most significant characters and how and why they became what they did, from director Matthew Vaughn (Layer Cake, Stardust, Kick-Ass). Basically the film opens in 1944 with twelve year old Charles Xavier (Laurence Belcher) meeting ten year old Raven (Morgan Lily) and being happy to find someone else ""different"", because he is a telepathic, and she has the ability of shape-shifting into other people. We also see young Erik Lehnsherr (Bill Milner) in the Nazi concentration camps forced by scientist Dr. Schmidt (Kevin Bacon) to show his ability, of course it only comes out with rage, seeing his mother shot to death for example, he can bend and lift all metals. Nearly twenty years pass, Professor Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) has graduated and published a thesis on mutation, and Raven aka Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence), who keeps her true form hidden, is living with him as his adoptive sister. Erik Lehnsherr aka Magneto (Michael Fassbender) meanwhile has perfected his metal based power, and he wants revenge for the death of his parents, by of course killing Schmidt, real name Sebastian Shaw, who has an ability himself, to absorb energy and use it as defence. After witnessing a plot by Shaw to have a Colonel's identity stolen in order to have missiles made ready to attack, Dr. Moira MacTaggert (Insidious's Rose Byrne) needs Xavier with his theories and knowledge of mutation to convince the CIA that mutants exist, and that Shaw is a threat. While sponsored by the unnamed Man In Black Suit (Eraser's Oliver Platt), they manage to track the threatening man down, and just in time to stop Erik from killing both the terrorist inside the submarine, as well as himself. Entering the CIA secret ""Division X"" facility, they meet another mutant Hank McCoy (Skins' Nicholas Hoult), who has hands for feet, and has created Cerebro, the device that used by Charles can track all mutants of the world, so they can recruit them. Along the way they find and train Angel Salvadore aka Wings (Zoë Kravitz, Lenny's daughter) who sprouts angel like wings, Armando Muñoz aka Darwin (Edi Gathegi) who adapts to an environment, e.g. gaining gills to breathe underwater, Alex Summers aka Havok (Lucas Till) who can emit cosmic energy waves to attack, and Sean Cassidy aka Banshee (Caleb Landry Jones) who has powerful vocal cords causing waves of sound, that can help him fly and attack. While Charles and Erik meet Emma Frost (American Pie: The Wedding's January Jones), the rest of the mutants as the secret facility are found by Shaw, along with his gang of mutant villains, including Azazel (Jason Flemyng) who can create streams of paralysing and destructive energy and also teleport, and Janos Quested aka Riptide (Álex González), and he wants to recruit them to other side, he manages to get Angel, and Darwin is killed. After the facility has been destroyed, Charles takes the remaining mutants to be trained at his family mansion where they all perfect their powers, Hank created a formula he thought would get rid of the mutant gene, but for him it only made it increase and he turns blue to become Beast, and they all get protective uniforms. While the Cuban Missile Crisis is going on with the involvement of President John F. Kennedy, Shaw is wearing a protective helmet that stops Charles being able to connect to his mind, and he does everything he can to cause World War III. The mutant heroes fight off the villains with their perfected abilities, and against the wishes of Charles, Erik fulfils his desire to kill Shaw, and taking the telepathy blocking helmet with him, and he unintentionally gets Moira to shoot Charles in the spine. The end of the film sees Erik leaving with his new cohorts Mystique, Angel, Riptide and Azazel, Moira promises Charles, who is bound in a wheelchair, not to reveal his desire to open a school for mutants, but he erases her memory to make sure, and finally Magneto breaks out Emma Frost. Also starring Hugh Jackman as a brief Logan aka Wolverine, Rebecca Romijn as a brief older Raven aka Mystique, Total Recall's Michael Ironside as Captain and Home Alone 3's Olek Krupa as Soviet Captain. McAvoy makes a superb young Professor X, Fassbender may not be bothering with an English accent like Sir Ian McKellen but is just as terrific, Bacon is indeed a fantastic villain (I didn't even know he was starring), I will say it does start a little slow, but once half an hour or so has passed you are definitely hooked by the great performances, the action packed fight scenes and of course the amazing special effects to take you to this extraordinary alternative universe, a brilliant fantasy action adventure. Very good!"

","Am I the only one who thinks this movie was ridiculous and simply bad? I mean McAvoy's and Fassbender's performance was awesome but thats not enough. Apart from the bad CG and the predictable plot there's a lot in this film that disturbs the overall experience. How about the SR-71 blackbird for example. You can barely fit two people in there and yet here they are cruising around with 7 people and as if that wasn't enough the plane starts hovering in the air like a harrier.... SERIOUSLY!?

Charles lives in a well-to-do family and grows up with Raven (or Mystique). He earns his Professorship and studies mutant. James McAvoy, who plays Charles Xavier, stumbles in between the brink of war initiated by Sebastian Shaw (star Kevin Bacon).

They soon recruit more mutants on their side, coach them on their abilities and work together to stop Shaw from starting the war between America and Russia. Erik has another extra intention though. Amazing acting from the stars brought out the best of all the characters - Emma Frost, Beast, Banshee, Havok, to name a few in the movie.<br/><br/>The development of this movie is great- a blend of high adrenaline pumping action scenes with depth on characterisation. We follow the lives and struggles of the mutants, silently standing on their side. Hugh Jackman makes a cameo appearance for Wolverine- keep you eyes open! The effects of the movie are sufficient to blow your mind away with missiles and explosions, tornado and waves.<br/><br/>The great thing about X-Men movies, particularly in this latest one, is that it has a solid storyline that packs a punch, relives the characters from the comic and leaves every fan with a taste for more! Spectacular! Definitely an ideal pick for the weekend ahead."
"shatteredrifle","9","4","8","7 June 2011"," X-Men: First Class - Refreshing Comeback for a Decade Old Franchise
","For those familiar with the X-Men movie franchise, X-Men: First Class is like drinking a glass of iced tea on a sunny day --- a nice break from all the complicated things that happened in the previous four movies. For first time viewers, it's a ticket to an alternate world full of beauty and hate, a world full of hope and fear.<br/><br/>This is an example of a movie that was actually better than the trailer, an achievement in today's age of overly-hyped productions. First Class knew where it was headed and what points to hit. At the opening scene, we are sucked into young Magneto suffering at the hands of Nazis. Although this almost identical scene was already shown in the first X-Men movie, this gives us a chance to see where the struggle for mutant survival starts. Throughout the film, this struggle boils up and finally leads to the inevitable confrontation between humans and mutants. Matthew Vaughn did a great job in not making the film a teen whining fest. Instead, we are treated to a nice blend of action and story which makes you anticipate what will happen next. The cast of characters is diverse; some favorites like Mystique are brought back while lesser-known mutants like Banshee are given a chance to shine.<br/><br/>This could hardly be called a breakout role for Michael Fassbender (300) given his performance in other films, but it sure has elevated his status to lead role material. He portrays Magneto with a deadly charm that actually makes you root for him. James McAvoy also did a solid job as Professor X. However, I cannot help but feel that First Class sympathizes more with Magneto than Professor X. We know of Magneto's past, and the movie focuses a great deal on his revenge against Shaw, but what about Xavier? We see him as a child, but not much more about his life that would make his character more interesting.<br/><br/>The X-Men have always been a symbol of non-conformity, and that aspect is fleshed out excellently in First Class. In a world where being different is frowned upon, there are just these few who just stick out even they do not want to. Another good point of the film was that it was able to tackle the side of the humanity. Because humans are naturally resistant to change, they attack and try to eliminate something that they don't understand. In the end, they get to accomplish a sense of warped unity born out of fear, at the cost of alienating another group of species, the ""homo superior."" In a sense, First Class also shows humanity's own struggle for survival.<br/><br/>Close-minded comic book fans may tend to dislike the film, seeing that it has deviated a lot from canon. For one, Beast is the only original X-Man (aside from Charles Xavier) featured in this film. However, this has opened a lot of doors for other people to actually get interested in the history of the group, a history so rich that it is almost impossible for a casual viewer not to be immersed in the lives of these mutants who just want to be who they were destined to be. Some may call this industry move mainstreaming, but being a comic book fan myself, I'd like to think of it as a big shout out to everyone that superhero movies have heart and are not just venues for amazing special effects.<br/><br/>There was great expectation for X-Men: First Class, and for the most part, it has delivered. It proves there are a lot more stories to tell about these accidental heroes and villains, stories which will keep us at the edge of our seats and will make us crave for a whole lot more."
"jon.h.ochiai","10","4","8","5 June 2011"," Between rage and serenity...
","Passionate James McAvoy as Charles Xavier implores his dear friend Erik Lehnsherr (sullenly charismatic Michael Fassbender) to let go and harness his innate power, ""True focus lies somewhere between rage and serenity."" ""X-Men: First Class"" is about rediscovering one's power and choosing one's life path. In ""First Class"" the difference between the hero and the villain may be choice. Director and Writer Matthew Vaughn's ""X-Men: First Class"" has unexpected pathos. Set in 1962 ""X-Men: First Class"" compellingly tells the origins of the X-Men mythology. This is surprising given the numerous writers involved: Ashely Edward Miller, Zack Stentz, Jane Goldman, Sheldon Turner, and Bryan Singer (writer and director of the first two X-Men movies). Singer's signature narrative strands resonate here. Charles rescues Erik, who almost forfeits his life all for vengeance, reminding him, ""You are not alone!"" <br/><br/>For Singer, ""X-Men"" has always been his allegory of courage in the face of prejudice and fear. In ""X-Men"" Mutants, ""Children of the Atom"", are born with special powers. Consequently, neither Human, Mutants are feared and forced to conceal, who they are. Like all discriminated, Mutants have lost the freedom to be. Although with some whimsical patches, ""X-Men: First Class"" is amazingly somber. Its gravitas sources the period, 1962 during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Vaughn authentically recreates 1962. ""X-Men: First Class"" has a retro James Bond look and feel. The art deco lines are elegantly clean. The wardrobe has slender lines and muted tones. Unlike other X-Men movies, this one is sexy. Vaughn has January Jones and Rose Byrne in cool 60's lingerie, in context of course. He even inserts the benign homage to ""Basic Instincts"" with stunning Jones. ""First Class"" is visually stunning. At the spectacular story arc Erik (Fassbender), harnessing his power, lifts a submerged submarine into the sky.<br/><br/>On the downside ""X-Men: First Class"" has at least two too many mutants and subplots. They are distracting. The power of ""First Class"" lies in the relationship and transformation of Charles and Erik. McAvoy and Fassbender embody a formidable force. We are invested in their chosen fate. James McAvoy at first occurs as Harry Potter playing Xavier. He is deceptive in his compassion and strength. Unintentionally, he is the critical foil of the dominant dark presence of Erik. Through McAvoy's undying belief in the vestiges of nobility in Erik, we witness the tragic fall. Charles pleads with Erik, ""Killing will not bring you peace."" Erik reminds, ""Peace was never an option."" Fassbender is powerful. He is going to be a big star. As Erik, he compassionately leverages his pain and rage. Fassbender brilliantly hints at Erik's innate nobility and the cost of his forfeited humanity. Ultimately, Erik's fall from grace occurs when he succumbs to vengeance. To that end, Kevin Bacon is amazing as Sebastian Shaw, the man who created and cursed Erik. Bacon is awesome and convincing in his malevolent presence.<br/><br/>""X-Men: First Class"" recreates the opening of ""X-Men"". It is Poland 1944, young Erik is separated from his family as they are taken to the Nazi gas chambers. Immersed in fear and rage, Erik discovers his Mutant power over metal as he effortlessly twists the steel fence. Nazi scientist Shaw (Bacon) recognizes Erik's gift. In unspeakably ruthless act, Shaw coerces Erik to summon his power. Erik's life becomes ruled by vengeance. Back in wealthy English estate, we learn that young Charles is a telepath of uncharted ability. Not only can he read minds, he can also manipulate them. He befriends a fellow Mutant in Raven, a blue skinned shape shifter. Charles takes her in as his sister. Beautiful Jennifer Lawrence plays Raven as the young woman she becomes.<br/><br/>Charles and Erik's lives follow apparently divergent paths. Now 18 years later, Erik searches for Shaw in Argentina. Charles is at Oxford University with Raven. He is finishing his doctorate on human mutation. However one move ahead, Shaw is in Las Vegas generating his master plan to ignite World War III. CIA operative Moira MacTaggert (spunky Rose Byrne) witnesses Shaw in surveillance of Hell Fire Club. Byrne provides great spirit as Moira. Requiring expertise on Mutants, Moira seeks out Charles. Charles knowingly aligns forces with the CIA to bring Shaw to justice. This leads to the inevitable collision with Erik's path of vengeance. Vaughn masterfully orchestrates the tragic hero story and world brinkmanship.<br/><br/>There are so many Mutants on both sides of the fight. January Jones makes a seductive turn as Emma Frost, a telepath who can transform to diamond. Nicholas Hoult is strong as the angst ridden and innocent scientist Hank McCoy. The other X-Men classmates are cool, but get lost in the noise. Jennifer Lawrence brilliantly fleshes out Raven, who comes to terms with her own identity and leverages the plot tipping point.<br/><br/>""X-Men: First Class"" lives and dies in the brotherhood of Charles and Erik in the battle of good and evil. Through the performances of McAvoy and Fassbender, the lines are poignantly blurred. Triumph is solemn, and the fall from grace is tragic. ""X-Men: First Class"" may be the best X-Men movie. And it is just a great movie."
"Coneydogg","Null","4","8","4 June 2011"," a classic and a genre-defining movie!
","This second go around for the X-Men is as good as the first if not better. I seriously hope this is the start of another trilogy. Sure, they have a lot to live up to but this film seems more sophisticated and has a better story than the very first X-Men movie, which was primarily about setting up this universe. Here, the characters previously introduced are fleshed out in a comprehensive and cohesive manner, and the newly introduced characters are blended in seamlessly with the story. The cast-selection is perfect, even in the established roles. I had my doubts whether anyone could fill Patrick Stewart's or Ian Mckellen's shoes but that really wasn't the case. These actors just took the younger roles and played it perfectly. I loved the action and the heart of this film and, again, it all perfectly blends with what's come before without relying on it at all. This stuff stands on its own and stands tall.<br/><br/>I remember back in May, my friend and I walked out of the theatre after seeing Thor smiling. We loved that film and anointed it the best of the summer. Well, maybe we were a bit hasty in our judgment. I knew this X-Men movie would be better than X3, but I wasn't expecting to walk in and see a classic and a genre-defining movie. Thor still rates right at the top of the summer but right now, X-Men First Class is the best movie of the year. Bring on the sequels!"
"Meven_Stoffat","6","4","8","3 June 2011"," The movie we should have gotten after X2
","I grew up with the X Men cartoons- ah, the childhood memories. I remember reading the comics and wishing I was as cool as Magneto, Wolverine, Beast, etc. I remember when X Men 1 came out... and oh man it was F'ing cool. I wanted to be like Wolverine. I loved that Cyclops' name was Scott. I got it on VHS for Christmas and I was 9 years old. I think I nearly wore out the tape!!! <br/><br/>X2 was probably the best of the original trilogy, in my opinion. It was the perfect mix of fanservice and crowd pleasing. When X3 came out, I was excited... but was so disappointed when I went and saw it. What happened? Who were all these random mutants??? What purpose did they serve? Why was all this story crammed in? And X Men Origins ran the franchise even further into the ground. Quite frankly I was done with the X Men franchise by then.<br/><br/>And then, ANOTHER X Men movie gets made. Oh dear. A PREQUEL???? George Lucas made 3 tragedies that were prequels. But wait... Michael Fassbender is in it, as is James MacAvoy!!! And it's directed by Matthew Vaughn. That's when I decided, OK, I'll start taking this movie seriously now. And then I saw the trailer... I was excited... This is the X Men I want to see.<br/><br/>And believe me. This movie ROCKED. Me being the geek I am, I went and saw it today. And trust me, it does NOT disappoint! X2 was my favorite of the series, but it looks like I have to reconsider. I'm not kidding, this movie is what I wanted to see after X2. <br/><br/>This is, as I stated, a prequel. The first half may disorient you a little- it focuses mainly on Erik and Charles. We learn of Erik's childhood in Nazi-occupied Poland, and how he came to terms with his magnetic powers. Whereas Charles, the man with clearly the better childhood, comes to terms with his mind reading abilities. We follow them through thick and thin- Charles' academic ventures and relationship with Raven and Erik's vengeful outings. We do see them meet, one night when Erik unsuccessfully tries to stop Sebastian Shaw, the film's villain, and his crew.<br/><br/>This leads to the meetings with a few Youth with mutant powers. Raven, who can turn into another person easily is automatically in, we have a scientist with feet that can grab, a woman with firefly wings, A man with a sonar, a man who can adapt, another man who can wreak havoc with some destructive powers. This leads to Charles' creation of a school for these people, so they can prepare for their part in the Cuban Missile Crisis- a crisis fronted by Shaw.<br/><br/>Honestly... wow. I can't believe I actually liked a new X Men movie for once. At 132 minutes, not a single moment is wasted. The movie moves at an effective enough pace- equal amounts of action and character are to be found. There is a lot of great humour too, and the climax in Cuba is one intense nail biter. And they managed not to screw up the character arcs- except the fact that Charles loses his walking ability in the 60s yet at the beginning of X3 he can be seen standing. But that movie fracked lots of arcs up anyways, so I don't count it.<br/><br/>The acting is PHENOMENAL. Fassbender gives quite possibly the performance of a lifetime. His controlled rage and mannerisms are just... BRILLIANT. He manages to nail the role completely and carry the film in the palm of his hand. MacAvoy surprised me big time here as well and excelled as Charles. And Kevin Bacon was fantastic as Shaw. Honestly I can't think of a single bad performance, all were great.<br/><br/>In short, this film is the movie that defines ""Awesome summer movie"". It is the perfect mix of fanservice and crowd-pleasing. Even if you don't like X-Men you will still love this movie. By far the best movie of 2011!!!<br/><br/>OVERALL: 10/10<br/><br/>PROS: -Awesome script -Lots of action -Amazing performances -Great pacing -Not a second wasted<br/><br/>CONS: -...uuuuuuuuuuhhhhhhhhhhhh..."
"rparham","8","4","8","3 June 2011"," A prequel that works
","Typically when a film franchise decides to move into prequel territory, it rarely bodes well for the quality of the final product. There are, of course, exceptions to the rule, and X-Men: First Class is one of them. First Class brings the X-Men film franchise back from the land of mediocrity it seemed headed toward with the previous entry, X-Men Origins: Wolverine, and manages to mine some strong character material by revisiting where everything began.<br/><br/>X-Men: First Class opens in Poland in 1944 (and actually features footage from the original X-Men movie) in which we see young Erik Lensherr tortured by malevolent Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) where he learns to harness his magnetic powers, but only when put through severe emotional trauma. Meanwhile, in America Charles Xavier comes face to face with another mutant, Raven Darkholme, and his family takes her in as an adopted sister. 20 years later, Charles (James McAvoy) is studying for an advanced degree in genetics, Erik (Michael Fassbender) is on a mission to exact revenge on Shaw, and the world at large is just becoming aware of the existence of mutants. Shaw is hatching a plan to turn humans against one another so he and other mutants can emerge victorious from the carnage if humanity goes to war with itself, and only Charles and Erik, who begin recruiting mutants to help them thwart Shaw's plan, stand between humanity and nuclear war.<br/><br/>Many prequels exist simply to fill in the blanks between the known details of a franchise, and X-Men: First Class does tread some of that territory, as to be expected. But, for the most part, First Class works best when delving into the relationships between the characters who would be already established in the future X-Men films. The film focuses a fair amount of screen time on fleshing out Charles and Erik, as well as Charles and Raven, giving their interactions a degree of tragedy and pathos when viewed from the lens of the future. Raven, portrayed by Jennifer Lawrence, gets the majority of the depth that had not even really been hinted at in the other X-Men films, portraying her as someone who views Charles as much more than just an adopted brother, but also having to come to terms with the fact that her natural appearance, covered in blue scales, causes others, even Charles, to flinch, and she begins to realize that her path and Charles' will diverge in the future.<br/><br/>One of the strengths of First Class is in the casting of Kevin Bacon as the villainous Shaw. Bacon manages to deliver both a magnetic and threatening performance, someone who is always seemingly one step ahead of the people around him that he views as inferior to his evolved self. While Bacon is hardly restrained, he doesn't take Shaw over the top into the realm of parody or silliness. The other standout is the always engaging Michael Fassbender in the role of Erik. He embodies the rage and desire for revenge in Erik, on a mission to avenge his tragic past while also never trusting the humans surrounding him. When Fassbender is on screen, he commands the scene, and gives Erik a strong, memorable presence.<br/><br/>Lest you think X-Men: First Class is all darkness and unhappiness, it actually has a rather light touch at times. Director Mathew Vaughan manages to infuse the proceedings often with, dare I say it, a sense of fun, especially in scenes where the various X-Men are learning to use and harness their powers. There is also a degree of homage in many scenes in the film, both to the era in which it is set, the swinging early '60s, and to films of that era (you can't watch the scenes set in the war room and not think of Dr. Strangelove). There is a bit of tweaking of stereotypes of that era, such as sexism and the intolerance that was beginning to melt off society as the decade progresses. <br/><br/>X-Men: First Class is by no means perfect. In an attempt to hit many of the bases of setting up the future films, some elements feel a bit rushed and unexplored, glossed over instead of being given the room to breathe that it sometimes feels like it needs. Also, as with the initial three X-Men films, not all the characters are given the opportunity to be fully drawn, and some of the more peripheral characters are left underdeveloped.<br/><br/>That said, X-Men: First Class performs what would almost seem a cinematic miracle: it manages to save a franchise that many had written off. It is unsure what the future holds for the X-Men films, but if a few more like First Class can be served up, then they will be worth watching."
"yj20022002","10","4","8","3 June 2011"," First Class in every sense
","X-Men First Class is spectacular in every way. It tells the story of how Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr meet and begin a unique friendship. They form an alliance to attempt to stop a confrontation between the U.S. and the Soviet Union in a world teetering on the brink of nuclear war. The plot is very well written and executed, but it takes a back seat. The true gem of this movie is the character study between these two friends and future enemies. How their personalities and political views interact drive every element of the film. These are some of the most complex and well-written characters you'll ever see in a superhero or any film. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender were excellent in the lead roles. The rest of the cast deserve very high marks as well, especially Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique, and Nicholas Hoult as Beast. The movie never crumbles under the weight of being a prequel and the feeling of inevitability that comes with it. It still manages to surprise and entertain, even though some of the story is known. It also fills in a few blanks as well. It is a film that takes itself and it's audience seriously, which is refreshing. An instant classic for the action genre as well as the superhero film genre. A can't miss for anyone who enjoys good filmmaking"
"jack-pedder","9","4","8","3 June 2011"," Possibly the best Marvel film so far
","It's not 'The Dark Knight' reader. Don't go into first class expecting a gritty, boundary pushing superhero movie that will totally blow you away. It's honestly a tad formulaic, a few of the special effects are a bit off, the concept is a bit silly, the nitpick list could probably go on for a while...<br/><br/>Despite this, I absolutely loved this movie. X-men one was good, but too short and anti-climactic, X2 was a great blockbuster that really ramped up the franchise, X-men three was kind of a let down but not as bad as some say, Woloverine was just a bit rubbish, it had it's moments but... meh, First Class I feel, puts them all, even 2, to shame.<br/><br/>Let's start with the performances which I must say were all excellent. James McAvoy's Charles Xaivier (Professor X) was charming, intellectual and just plain likable, I think he really got it down to a tee. The same can be said of Michael Fassenbender who's Eric Lehnsherr (Magneto) was tragic, rage filled and in a lot of cases quite frightening. Without giving anything away, there's this scene in Argentina and I mean... DAMN! It turned into like a Tarantino film, it was thrillingly put together. Honestly this is an awesome Magneto. He owns the screen whenever he's there. The Villain, Robert shaw, played by Kevin bacon really strikes a chord on the douchometer scale. While I didn't really like him I think that was the point. He was a great overly nasty villain who the rest of the cast were able to play off perfectly. I really, really hated this guy, which was great. As for the rest of the cast they were all great too. Mystique was far more interesting here than in the prior three films, Beast was a good sort of metaphor for ugliness and the attempts to stop it, CIA agent Moria (or whatever her name was) was good, hell they were all good.<br/><br/>I think the film was actually more a character piece than anything else. The action scenes were great and all but it's the characters, the performances, the scripting that make this film shine above most of today's blockbusters. I'm not saying it will blow your mind, nor do I think it will change your outlook on film, but a a summer popcorn film, it is one of the best of it's kind.<br/><br/>My favourite Marvel film was probably Spider-man 2, but now, good god does this give it a run for it's money.<br/><br/>I hope Marvel will carry on to make movies of this high an entertainment value.<br/><br/>I love this film, it's a big exciting summer blockbuster, definitely the best of the year so far, with lots of action and lots of thrills that ultimately boils down to a character study on race, Human relations, and a friendship tragically falling apart under conflicting ideals.<br/><br/>9/10"
"blackmambamark","8","4","8","3 June 2011"," Matthew Vaughn just stabbed this series in the heart with an adrenaline needle
","The series that started out as MARVELS prize stallion in the film industry, has since been raped in the ass by films such as ""Wolverine"" and ""X-Men: Last Stand"". How can you possibly go forward with a series that has been tarnished twice? Well, you do what they did with Batman.....you start from the beginning. Yes, i know that this is truly NOT a reboot, but the studios are hoping that this leap back to the past will create a jump start on a series that was thought to be all but lost.....let's hope they're right for a change.<br/><br/>I can easily say this without feeling any regret.......this is without a doubt the best X-Men movie created. Yes, i know that most of you ""X2"" fans will be throwing your hands up in the air. But let me explain why.....<br/><br/>First off, the character development in this movie is amazing. Director Mathew Vaughn does an incredible job of making every single good character likable, and every bad character hateable. Watching a young Professor Xavier get drunk and hit on women. Watching a young Magneto cover the globe killing Nazis......uh, i'll watch that any day of the week. And since we're on the topic of Xavier and Magneto.....my god, if you thought the original combination of Ian McKellan and Patrick Stewart was amazing......wait until you see the combo of James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender. No, i'm not saying that this duo is better, but i'm not saying it's worse either. Never in my wildest dreams did i think anyone could compete, but these two are really something special to watch on screen. Even before they cross paths. Their characters alone could make an entire picture. Especially Michael Fassbender as Magneto. In my opinion, he's the one who stole the show.<br/><br/>As far as story lines....it's a bit of the same old stuff, just in a different time period. But this go around seems much fresher. It offers a much more different take and a broader spectrum than the typical 'These are humans, and these are Mutans...now fight'. It delves more into the history aspect, which to any guy, is always cool.<br/><br/>However, the only slight problem i had with the film was towards the end, right before the final battle. You have all these characters who just came together, and you're really ready to watch them finally go crazy after watching this amazing montage of Xavier helping them. And right after this happens, they drop some plot points out of nowhere. I get WHY they had to do it, but the placement felt just a bit off to me. I think if they spread them around the movie instead of having it come out of nowhere towards the end, then maybe it would have been okay. But does it take anything away from the film? Absolutely not.<br/><br/>Bottom Line.....i said it once, and i'll say it again. This is the best X-Men movie i have seen thus far. Everything from the acting to the storyline......it was amazing. And even thought i think a lot of people will give all the credit to the acting, which in a way they're right.....i however, give it all to Director Matthew Vaughn. He took a story which easily could have been crapped on by producers and studio exec's, and he made it his own, and he made it fresh and fun. Even if you disagree with me and say ""X2"" is still better...you still won't be able to deny the fact that this is certainly the most entertaining of the bunch. Without a doubt the best movie i have seen so far this year. Captain America and Green Lantern.....the bar has been set."
"DICK STEEL","10","4","8","2 June 2011"," A Nutshell Review: X-Men: First Class
","Bryan Singer's involvement in this film is a good thing, with his producer credit as well as getting involved in the story together with Sheldon Turner, since he was responsible for the first two critical and commercial hit of the X-Men films being able to show that an ensemble comic book film can work. But since a new direction was called for to wash away the bitter aftertaste of the latter two films of the franchise, in comes director Matthew Vaughn who did a class job in playing this film to its strengths, keeping the pace tight, the action eye popping, and the dramatic elements engaging. It seems like Vaughn is on a roll here in his choice of projects, and I'm hoping this one does well enough to warrant yet another outing with the X-Men, so long as the focus remains on wanting to tell a solid, strong story first like this one did, and not opt for something loud and mindless.<br/><br/>There are many elements of this film which made it enjoyable. For starters, having it go back to the good old 60s was an excellent move par none, taking us back to the point of the US- USSR nuclear crisis, where the US had strategically put nukes in Turkey, and the USSR soon to be responding with its own countermove involving Cuba. The historical context makes it a little bit more in line with our reality, though having the audacity to suggest that the evil mutants led by Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Six Degrees Bacon) and his team of Emma Frost (January Jones, playing a character who will probably be a fan favourite after this), Riptide (Alex Gonzalez) and Azazel (Jason Flemying) have starring roles in stirring up the super power rivalry to WWIII proportions.<br/><br/>The plan is simple, and in Sebastian Shaw we see the precursor of the mantle that Magneto / Erik Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender) would pick up from, since it's an Us Mutants against Them Humans mindset they adopt, preferring a more vocal outburst of opposition against discrimination, even if it means annihilation of those who are ordinary. Followers of X-Men the comics or the films would find this theme familiar, but in Vaughn's film, ample time is provided to develop the arguments against, and the very sexy arguments for this cause, with lines being deeply divided thus showing why and who decided to join which side of the war.<br/><br/>Then of course there's the strong friendship between Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and Magneto which was always hinted at in the earlier films, but this one brings us back to the origins of their friendship which developed so strongly given their unison to battle a common enemy, but their inevitable drift when their ideals and methodology start to differ drastically, one obviously preferring violence and using whatever means necessary to further the cause, and the other opting for a more peaceful approach, preferring to do good to convince us two-timing, fearful humans that those more powerful aren't necessary harbouring intentions to enslave, but just yearning for a peaceful co-existence. Both McAvoy and Fassbender excel in their leading roles as friends who will turn enemies in due course, making it all the more poignant when we see them do battle shoulder to shoulder now, knowing what will happen in the near future.<br/><br/>If it was an Origins film that was still mooted, then this one takes the cake indeed, with scenes showing off younger versions of Xavier and Lehnsherr, together with that of the other X-Men such as Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) who forms a tight relationship with Xavier before identity crisis meant a souring of sorts to what the future story would hold, the intelligent Hank McCoy/Beast (Nicholas Hoult), Banshee (Caleb Landry Jones), Havok (Lucas Till) amongst others in the first class fold, tutored and mentored personally by Xavier to harness their powers, before the big bang action sequence that expectedly combined everyone's strength to do battle against those on the opposite side.<br/><br/>Art direction was also down to a pat, where computers are large and imposing with plenty of buttons, gauges, valves and humongous tape drives, and who can forget the pristine looking Blackbird jet plane making its debut as the de-facto transport of choice for the X-Men, and that predominantly yellow suits also given a reason for the characters to don them. The ensemble cast of relative unknowns in leading roles also worked wonders, especially those amongst the new recruits since they are predominantly younger and are quite raw in the art of combat, and making mistakes, rather than being all too invulnerable, is the rule of thumb here. Visual effects are flawlessly employed to showcase their various powers.<br/><br/>X-Men: First Class brings us back to the time that examines the history of the X-Men before events of the first film kicked in, where Wolverine was still yet to be thrown into the Weapon X project, and before the likes of Jean Grey and Cyclops came into the picture. Keep your eyes and ears peeled for plenty of easter eggs and subtle references made in terms of what we already do know of the characters in the earlier films, and the irony in dialogue, making this X-Men first class indeed. Highly recommended, and a definite favourite of the summer films so far."

Yes I know that recent films get distorted ratings but this is taking the biscuit. <br/><br/>I'm struggling to picture the people who have rated this highly... perhaps overweight Marvel comic nerds, or 12 year old kids, or both, all gagging for the next X-men where all they want to see is an array of superpowers (sorry to ruin it but this is pretty much the plot of the movie.. introducing new characters and their powers.. fun for 2.5 hours if you're about 10)<br/><br/>To put this into perspective, I'm a 22 year old student from England who quite liked the first X-men movies and, in general, LOVE the top 250 on IMDb. If this list wants to retain any respect whatsoever, this film MUST go. Somehow. Just delete it from your records, please, like it never existed. I saw it with a group of maybe 30 other students. I think 3 or 4 people didn't hate it. The rest of us spent the following hour in McDonalds taking the mickey out of some of the more cringe worthy lines, poorly acted scenes, ridiculous plot, oh the list went on. Actually if you're looking for a great laugh after the film, then this is perfect. <br/><br/>Oh and this is my first ever review. Purely because I like IMDb ratings, but this one is SO off the mark it's a joke. Peace"
"purpleismanly321","9","5","11","11 June 2011"," Brilliant movie, should definitely see it.
","This was, honestly, an excellent movie. The dialogue was scripted well, and I could feel almost every emotion the characters were feeling. When Darwin died, I was sad. When they were fighting in the beach scene, I felt pumped. I'm surprised this wasn't the only one, or at least made it so you didn't know that there would be a sequel. Hopefully, there will be a sequel. Most Marvel movies KICK ASS. Ever seen Kick Ass? That was great. Thor? Awesome. Spiderman? Also, great movie. Truth be told, comic books are fantastic, and movies based on comics are fantastic-ly awesome. It's a win-WIN situation. For anyone who likes the X-Men comics, most Marvel comics, or, for that matter, movies in general,you should definitely see it."

","After two disappointing instalments, X-Men fans needed some heroes themselves, people who could revitalise the series and luckily, we got that with the director of the first two films and the man who was originally picked to direct X-Men: The Last Stand. The Bryan Singer/Matthew Vaughn combo was able to give the series the kick it needed, making a fun and action-packed film.<br/><br/>In 1962, the privileged Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) has graduated from Oxford University with a PhD in Genetics and has a very close relationship with his adopted sister, Raven (Jennifer Lawrence). On the other side of the coin is Erik Lehnsherr (the always awesome Michael Fassbender), a Holocaust surviving, hunting Nazis around the world, overall badass. Both are recruited by CIA agent Moira MacTarget (Rose Byrne) to help stop the Hellfire Club, lead by Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) and his group of powerful mutants; Emma Frost (January Jones), Azazel (Jason Flemyng), and Riptide (Alex Gonzalez). As the Hellfire Club manipulates the United States and the Soviet Union towards nuclear war, Charles and Erik go on their own recruiting drive to train mutants for their team, including Hank McCoy (Nicholas Hoult), Alex Summers (Lucas Till), and Angel Salvadore (Zoe Kravitz).<br/><br/>From what should have been a disaster of a film, Vaughn pulled it out of the bag and made a really fun summer blockbuster. Compared to Singer's whose X-Men movies were dark, in both story and style, Vaughn made his X-Men film a lighter and more colourful film, with a strong mix of drama and comedy, very much like Spider-man and Iron Man. Because of the quick production time some of the CGI is a bit ropey, but Vaughn proves himself a talented director with a great visual style, from his montages that interject comic book visuals to his action scenes. Vaughn ensures that there is plenty of mutant versus mutant action and just like in the Singer films, mutants use their powers logically. Some of the comedy is predictable, but still funny and the action scenes were tense, unlike Brett Ratner's approach in X-Men: The Last Stand who broke up action sequences with humour.<br/><br/>The plot itself is very similar to the James Bond film Tomorrow Never Dies, since it comes down to an outside force trying to start a war for their own ends. Continuing with the Bond film there is a certain feel in the early part of the film with Erik's global travelling and the scene with Moira in bra and panties, which was very much like something from a Bond or even Austin Powers movie.<br/><br/>X-Men: First Class is a film that focuses on characters and relationships, a strength of any good action film, or as I see it, an X-Men film with action in it. There are strong ideologies being formed with Shaw taking the place of Magneto in this world. There are also ideas about how government circles and intelligence agencies would react to the discovery of a new breed of humanity. The Nazi Scientist was very much like the Emperor in Star Wars, pretty much saying ""let the anger consume you"".<br/><br/>What X-Men: First Class needed in order to be successful was a strong chemistry between McAvoy and Fassbender, which we got. They have a yin and yang relationship as they share a goal but have two different ways about how to achieve it, yet you can still believe they are friends. Many of the supporting cast members were strong, Bacon is of course, intelligent and powerful with a sinister Southern accent and capably assisted by the beautiful January Jones. Some of the characters were sidelined, but I am sure they will be developed in the sequel.<br/><br/>As a fanboy, I could make a list of things the filmmakers got wrong from the comics and continuity with the first three films, but it was so well made as a stand-alone movie it doesn't really matter. Really, it's just as much a reboot as it is a prequel. There are also plenty of cameos that will keep fans happy. X-Men: First Class is the best X-Men film since X2: X-Men United."

Some of the makeup (Beast) was not very good, and Emma Frost was bland and boring. Some of the first class were underdeveloped ( Darwin, Havok, Banshee) but beast had an excellent arc and was well acted, overall very enjoyable and funny.

"CinematicInceptions","8","2","3","10 December 2015"," More than you expect.
","While this prequel has its faults, it was great to see another big budget and box office movie that gave us a great story with some depth. Even if movies like this don't involve a lot of risk of getting bad reviews or not making enough money, this was clearly made to be better than it needed to be. Whether the result is good or bad, that's something the world needs more of. I will take this preliminary paragraph to also say that this is the only X-Men movie I've seen, but I have a decent grasp on how the other movies work in relation to this one.<br/><br/>The plot was basically action driven, but not in a spy thriller way. You need to understand and be curious about the villain's plan to appreciate the rest of the film, but it's not that hard to follow. That said, it is useful to have a little background knowledge about the Cuban Missile crisis. The nuclear warfare element is certainly not new, but I don't think the cinematic world will do away with it until there is a permanent solution to the threat of nuclear war in the real world. Connected with the nuclear war plot is the conflict over whether humanity can be trusted with the knowledge that mutants exist. In this case we have three different approaches to this. Charles' approach: humans are equal to mutants and just need to be reasoned with. Erik's approach: humanity is the enemy because they always hate what they don't understand. And Shaw's approach: humanity is inferior and should be extinguished so that nature can take its course. Charles' trust in humanity is what really makes him the ""good guy"" protagonist.<br/><br/>What I saw as the greatest feat of this movie was character writing. They weren't put together perfectly, but they are written the way characters should be written. All of the mutant's powers contributed to their arcs and personalities in ways that felt like how real people's personalities work. Charles' ability lets him see into people and understand them, and he consequently has sympathy and respect for those around him. This is shown best in the instances when he decides not to employ his telepathic abilities. Eric's constant anger is perfectly explained in how his magnetism works. He thrives on his ability and only ever uses it through rage, so it is rather tragic when we see him lapse deeper into his hatred and fear of humanity at the end after Charles tries to help him become a better man. The whole subplot of Raven and Hank (Mystique and Beast) being conflicted over whether to express their mutation openly is also related to their mutations. This was a shaky basis for the justification of Mystique joining Eric, though. Even Shaw's hunger for war was well-motivated, or it at least made sense. As an audience, we don't agree with Shaw's intentions by any means, but we at least see where he's coming from. Of course, this is limited to the main characters that are developed throughout, but that's not to say that the minor characters aren't written well.<br/><br/>As we've seen with other prequels, there are some necessary events that have to take place so as to maintain continuity. Here, I found that some of these things felt a little forced even though they didn't detract from the overall product. Charles getting shot in the spine worked out okay in the moment, but him talking about going bald was a little bit much. Erik becoming Magneto was better, but then the other mutants choosing sides didn't work out as nicely. It just wasn't necessitated by this movie on its own.<br/><br/>The special effects weren't as spectacular as you might expect for this sort of movie, but the cinematography and directing were awesome. The script and acting were both slightly above par, but you could have a reasonable gripe about either. Henry Jackman has a great and empowering score to accompany the visuals.<br/><br/>If you're looking for action, but want it to be more than just a bunch of fight scenes strung together, this is a great pick. It seems to be conducive to fans of X-Men in general. Just as a warning, the female roles are a little objectified. It's not to an obscene or offensive degree, but it could be annoying to some people. But in a nutshell, it's interesting, entertaining, very well-done, and will stick with you. Overall Rating: 8.4/10."
"justingivens-37319","8","2","3","27 September 2015"," The second best X-men movie
","This movie is by far one of the best X-men movies. The plot twist is very intriguing where it has Wolverine (Huge Jackson) going back into the past in order to alter the future. Also in the movie, the X-men face an enemy like never before which forces Professor X and Magneto to work together. <br/><br/>This is the type of movie where you have to watch from start to end because the director, Bryan Singer, is always throwing little hints and flashbacks that connect all of the previous X-men movies with this one. You won't need to watch all the previous movies in order to understand this one; however I would suggest watching the previous movie X-Men:First Class (2011) because that movie is most directly tied to this one.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a great movie that is very enjoyable no matter if you read the comic books or not."
"Tweekums","8","2","3","23 September 2015"," A fine origins story
","This prequel shows us the origins of the X-Men. It opens in the same place as the original film as Erik Lensherr, a young boy in a Nazi concentration camp, is separated from his mother and somehow bends the metal gates with his mind. This is witnessed by scientist Dr. Klaus Schmidt who decides to research the boy's powers. Across the Atlantic another meeting is taking place; young telepath Charles Xavier finds a shapeshifter, named Raven, stealing food from his kitchen; rather than alerting anybody he is happy to meet somebody else with powers and befriends her.<br/><br/>The action then moves forward to 1962 and Erik is searching for Schmidt while Xavier is receiving his doctorate in Oxford. Schmidt, now calling himself Sebastian Shaw, is trying to engineer a war between the United States and the Soviet Union with the help of three mutants. One of his meetings is witnessed by CIA agent Moira MacTaggert; her report about mutants is disregarded and she sets about finding an expert in the field Xavier. Once on board he sets about finding and recruiting other mutants, including Erik, to stop Shaw. It emerges that Shaw is also a mutant who believes that non-mutant humans must be eliminated. Once Xavier has found a group of young mutants he sets about helping them get the best of their abilities will it be enough to stop Shaw and prevent a nuclear war?<br/><br/>I must admit when I started watching this I wasn't expecting anything special as prequels often fail to live up to the original films; largely because we know that main characters must survive thankfully I was wrong. While we knew certain characters would survive that didn't weaken the story; there were plenty we didn't know about and what we learn about the early lives of familiar characters is interesting. The cast does a great job with Michael Fassbender being particularly effective as Erik the troubled man destined to become Magneto, James McAvoy does a fine job as Xavier and Jennifer Lawrence delightfully portrays Raven as she comes to terms with her differences and becomes Mystique. The story is exciting and nicely incorporates real life events, namely the Cuban missile crisis. The special effects are top notch making the impossible look believable. Overall a fine origins story that fans of the original and people new to the franchise can enjoy."

From there, they became full-grown adults, or mutants, and will soon meet each other and create a team to help the government.<br/><br/>The acting in this film was simply spectacular, primarily Micheal Fassbender as Magneto. I loved his acting, and it gave a nice, menacing feel that a villain should have.<br/><br/>The effects in this film was over-the-top, and there was a adequate amount of action. The scenes were just right for its age group, it was not too violent. At the same time, the scenes were awesome, especially those with Micheal Fassbender and James McAvoy.<br/><br/>Over all, this film is one of the best X-Men movies to date.

"Leofwine_draca","5","2","3","20 May 2014"," Superhero prequel fails to breathe new life into tired franchise
","X-MEN: FIRST CLASS is a film that aims to breathe new life into a somewhat tired franchise (so far consisting of the original trilogy and two stand-alone Wolverine stories) by telling the back story of the Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen characters from the original movies. Thus we're handed a bright young cast of up-and-comers who engage in their own superhero adventures.<br/><br/>The setting is the early '60s, at the height of the Cold War. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender, playing the early versions of Stewart and McKellen respectively, recruit some familiar and not-so familiar mutants to help them wage a war against generic bad guy Kevin Bacon. What follows is watchable but overlong and fairly underwhelming, offering exactly the kind of CGI-heavy spectacle as the other films in the series while failing to engage the brain properly at any time.<br/><br/>It goes without saying that McAvoy and Fassbender - particularly the latter - are by far the best things in this movie. The rest of the cast, including Jennifer Lawrence, are lacklustre and some of them, such as Nicholas Hoult playing a goofy boffin, are downright embarrassing. Bacon's on autopilot, while Rose Byrne gives one of the most excruciatingly wooden turns I've seen in recent months, a surprise given she was pretty good in previous movies like SUNSHINE and 28 WEEKS LATER.<br/><br/>Like the STAR WARS prequels, this film was conceived of a way of starting afresh while at the same time bringing back some old and much-loved characters who are a guaranteed box-office draw. But the film rings fairly hollow, and while it works as a bit of spectacle, it's one of those movies you forget about straight after. It says something that the most excitement I had was seeing one of my favourite character actors, Michael Ironside, in a role amounting to little more than a cameo as a ship's captain. I find Matthew Vaughn a hit and miss director and this is more miss than hit, unfortunately."

Do not get me wrong, these actors/actresses play their parts (for the most part) pretty well. There are a few minor exceptions (Jennifer Lawrence, whose acting is a bit hit and miss). For the most part the recasting choices are pretty good with James McAvoy playing Professor X and Michael Fassbender as Magneto. Do notice that Wolverine is not a major character in this film (all he gets is a cameo). If he was going to have a cameo why bother with putting him in the film at all? Either he is a major character in the film or not in the film at all. No between. The directing in this film is pretty good as well. I have not watched any other Matthew Vaughn films to be able to compare, but it gives me hope for a lot of his other films should I decide to watch them. The action is done pretty well with some great scenes that are some of the best in the entire X-Men film franchise. The plot is fairly simple.

Its new cast is great as the young characters, especially McAvoy and Fassbender who - along with a nuanced and layered script - convincingly portray the origins of their respectful yet tumultuous relationship. It doesn't quite capture the spirit of the original, but has a lot more life in its presentation and provided a successful revitalisation to a franchise that was running out of steam. Like its predecessors, it is at its best when pondering the thematic quandries at the heart of its core concepts but it also has a few stand-out set-pieces and some nice dark, yet understated, brutality (the concentration camp makes a return). It isn't wholly necessary but the prequel idea wasn't entirely played out at this point and this feature does a lot with the origins of interesting characters, unlike 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009)' before it, and started the series in a new, and initially fresh, direction. 8/10"
"MaximumMadness","8","1","1","13 October 2017"," ""X-Men: First Class""- A well-constructed and oft-thrilling backstory for the iconic mutant team!
","Since its debut in 2000, 20th Century Fox's ""X-Men"" film franchise has stood tall as one of the longest-running and generally most successful comic-to-film franchises of all time- currently boasting ten entries and with several more sequels, prequels and follow-ups looming on the horizon. But it hasn't always been a smooth ride as any fan will tell you, and the quality of the individual films has ranged from stellar to sub- par, depending on the entry and the creative team behind them. And this is best exemplified by the first five entries... with the original two films being very fun and well-constructed action- adventures, only to be followed-up by two lackluster let-downs in the form of ""The Last Stand"" and ""Origins.""<br/><br/>But then something magical happened. After a two-picture absence, original director Bryan Singer returned to produce and co-write the fifth chapter in the ever-growing saga, with Matthew Vaughn taking the reigns and assembling a talented cast of relative newcomers. And together, these brilliantly creative minds unleashed ""X-Men: First Class"", a quasi-prequel that gives us the previously hinted-at backstory of Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr, and how they became the best of friends before turning into bitter enemies. ""First Class"" is a very well assembled and often thrilling installment in the franchise that boasts strong visuals, likable characters and a surprising depth!<br/><br/>Haunted by the death of his family and his own exploitation at a Nazi prison camp during his youth, Erik Lensherr (Michael Fassbender) seeks to use his mutant powers of magnetism to strike back against his former tormentor- a twisted man named Sebastian Shaw. (Kevin Bacon) At the same time, young telepath Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and his shape-shifting adoptive sister Raven/Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) find themselves pulled into the world of the CIA by agent Moira MacTaggert (Rose Byrne), to be used as consultants working against Shaw. Eventually, the two men meet and form a strong but begrudging friendship, putting together a team of mutants known as the ""X- Men""... But Lensherr's past agony and pain might be too much of a burden on the group, and threatens to tear them apart...<br/><br/>The strength of the film lies in the surprisingly thoughtful and complex story that Vaughn and Singer weave, in addition the keen visual direction and highly likable cast. The story is an emotional roller-coaster, with many twists and turns to keep the audience invested all while still grounding the plot in real human relationships. Much of the film is centered on the interpersonal friendships between Erik, Charles and Raven, and they give the story a strong foundation to build upon. At its heart, ""First Class"" is a story about damaged people, and how confronting the past can either save or destroy us. Thankfully, the film avoids being bogged down in constant turmoil through clever humor brought about by the youthful energy of the team, and it strikes a fine balance. It's never too harsh to be entertaining, nor is it ever too fun to be impactful.<br/><br/>Vaughn's brilliant eye for composition and flow never ceases to amaze, and ""First Class"" is arguably the most visually arresting film of the franchise. Vaughn's films always have a certain ""hyper-reality"" to them in terms of style and tone, and it mixes well with the series that Singer has established. There's plenty of eye-popping action and subversive thrills to be had, in addition to some subtle and very intimate scenes. It's a very well-made film. And this is only made all the better by the magnificent cast. McAvoy and Fassbender both command the screen with their performances, and are each given many a moment to shine as they go through life-changing experiences. Particularly Fassbender, who is just awe-inspiring as the man who will become Magneto. I also quite enjoyed Lawrence (in her pre-""Hunger Games"" days) and Byrne in their more supportive roles as the women in Xavier's life. Both have unique and clearly defined character arcs and add a lot to the film. Other parts played by the likes of Nicholas Hoult, Lucas Till and Caleb Landry Jones as members of the ""X-Men"" team are pitch- perfect in their casting. And of course, special commendations go to the delightful Kevin Bacon, who does a great job as a scenery- chewing baddie that you'll just love to hate. Also, keep your eyes peeled for a surprise cameo that I won't spoil, but made the entire film for me!<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I do have to say that there are some minor problems holding the film back just shy of perfection. While the movie is well-paced and well-structured for much of its run-time, the third act is a bit messy and relies too much on generic clichés to strike home with the same impact as the rest of the film. In addition, the fact that the film is a prequel does rob a lot of the suspense as we know who will live or die and how it will all end. And finally... despite being a prequel, the film makes some rather unorthodox choices that really bugged me and contradict what came before. Yes, it was only ever meant to be a sort-of ""quasi-prequel"" that would bend or change canon and continuity when needed. But the fact it tries so hard to tie into the original trilogy while also incessantly changing key details of the previously-established backstory does genuinely annoy me as an audience member. And that's not spoiling anything, because it happens throughout the entire film.<br/><br/>""X-Men: First Class"" might not be a perfect film, and the questionable choices it makes in regards to the canon and continuity of the franchise might alienate some hardcore series fans. But that doesn't change the fact that it boasts a remarkable cast, keen visual direction and an absolutely wonderful storyline filled to burst with emotion and pathos. It's a darned-fine film and overall a fantastic prequel to the excellent original. And I give it a very good 8 out of 10!"
"ChocolatePrince","8","1","1","16 August 2017"," X-men First Class is a solid reboot.
","X-Men: First Class is arguably the best of the X-Men series which comes as a relief. Part of the reason why First Class is so successful is that it places emphasis over the characters rather than plot. At the heart of the movie is the relationship between Professor Xavier and Erik Lensherr. The movie does an excellent job of crosscutting between Erik and Professor Xavier's childhood to showcase how their unique mutant powers have shaped them. Erik grew up in a Nazi concentration camp in Poland and Charles Xavier grew up in an affluent mansion in upstate New York. <br/><br/>Needless to say, when Erik and Charles eventually meet each other as adults, it's clearly obvious that these two have very different ideology's about how to do deal with humans, and the film plays with this idea to some degree. Charles Xavier first meets Erik Lensherr for the first time in Miami, and the rest of the film showcases them recruiting other mutants. Unfortunately, the film has X-Men in the title, so there are other supporting mutant characters integral to the film as well.<br/><br/>Alas, most of these characters are underdeveloped, and because of this, you come to know them by their powers instead of their personalities. However, the performances by James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender are good enough to anchor the film. Fassbender, in particular, is a standout he plays Erik Lensherr as a charismatic James Bond type with a real chip on his shoulder.<br/><br/>His performance as Erik Lensherr is absolutely magnetic if you forgive the pun. Xavier, however, is a little bland, but this is due to no fault on McAvoy's part. The writers obviously couldn't figure out how to make Xavier a more compelling character. Fortunately, McAvoy's performance is good enough to make up for this oversight. Jennifer Lawrence is good as Mystique/Raven she gives Mystique a certain naive sweetness. Kevin Bacon is also excellent as the megalomaniac mutant Sebastian Shaw.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, his character is never really given any real depth, he's simply a one-dimensional villain. The film also would have benefited from exploring the creator/monster dichotomy between Sebastian Shaw and Erik Lensherr a bit further. It was one of the more intriguing ideas in the film that was left unexplored. Overall, X-Men: First Class is an entertaining action film with good performances from its two leads, and it has some pretty kinetic action sequences scattered throughout the film. The film is definitely a must see for those that were disappointed with the last two X-Men films."

","X Men is one of my favourite franchises of all time I've liked most of them but I wasn't entirely sure if this film was going to be my cup of tea but I could not have been more far off and could not have loved it more. The whole plot of this film revolves around the friendship between Xavier and Eric, even though we knew that they were eventually going to fall out the filmmakers could not have done a better job at portraying their friendship. They are very well set up as very different characters and feel as if they can both achieve what they want through each other. The chemistry between James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender was amazing and it helped to make the film much more investing. Jennifer Lawrence was also fantastic in this movie as Mystique she real carried her characters conflicted nature throughout. The villains in this film were also fantastic, ill admit their motivations were a bit conventional but it terms of pure threat level and back story they were done just right and set up as the perfect opposing force to the mutants. Another thing that I loved about this movie is that all the characters contribute something to the plot whether it be through there abilities or opinions it proves that the X Men franchise is much more than just pure superhero entertainment but thought provoking drama that in some ways mirrors real life. We got to see things in this film that we have never seen in any of the other films in this series, for one we see younger more relatable versions of Professor X and Magneto, we see Charles as a young bachelor and his humble beginnings, we see a vulnerable and in some ways reckless Magneto and it not only adds something to this film but to the franchise itself. Another thing we saw in this film that we've never seen in any other X Men films is he actual recruitment and training of the mutants, we get to see just how Xavier did it and lived up to all expectations. When we eventually see the fall out of Magneto and Professor X it's heartbreaking, we see just how similar yet different both of them are and it really helps to give context to the rest of the franchise. <br/><br/>This film was not only a gift to all fans of X Men but a very entertaining, thought provoking drama that builds up and gives context to a lot of events that we've heard about in the other films. All the casting was perfect, McAvoy and Fassbender have absolutely amazing chemistry and is easily one of this franchises best instalments. <br/><br/>100%/A+"
"generationofswine","7","1","1","19 November 2016"," An Honest Review
","I wasn't the biggest fan. I'm not going to say that it is the absolute greatest, or even the greatest X-Men film on earth.<br/><br/>Honestly, if you were to ask me, they should have just killed the franchise after the travesty that was X-Men The Last Stand. And killed it in the same way that you put down a beloved yet rabid dog.<br/><br/>But clearly they didn't and instead they gave us the oddest reboot I've ever seen.<br/><br/>I can't really complain about this one like I do so many others. And I'm inclined to give them some very serious props for how they did it. They effectively killed absolutely every argument I have against reboots and remakes.<br/><br/>Most of the time, with reboots and remakes, the complaint is that they are doing it because the originals were popular and made money and want to bank on that success, however they tend to redo it in a way that takes out all the charm that made the first ones so beloved, rewrite the history that fans love in such a way it's insulting, and dumb it down to appeal to the masses whilst upping the special effects in the hopes that no one notices.<br/><br/>Usually it's all done with the explanation that ""Millennials don't understand satire and/or dark humor."" At least that is how it went with Robocop, The Evil Dead, Nightmare on Elm Street, Scream, The Amazing Spider-Man, and so on and so forth.<br/><br/>X-Men: First Class seems to break the remake/reboot laws. Rather than re-writing the history (because the first two were really good) and destroying everything that made them so loved...they rebooted the series in the past, recast the actors, and largely left the future chronology in place.<br/><br/>And, to reassure audiences that they weren't destroying everything they loved, they added the opening scene of the very first X-Men movie and made sure to add as much Googie architecture as possible while siting well remembered past events to assure us that, yes, what we loved is still alive and present.<br/><br/>It shut people like me up. I can't hate on it for being a reboot because it addressed my concerns and moved on nicely.<br/><br/>Plus the cast was great. Michael Fassbender was awesome, January Jones, Caleb Landry Jones, and Rose Byrne were outstanding and to add a cherry on top they threw in Kevin Bacon as the Big Bad.<br/><br/>Was it because Bacon is awesome or just to give people my age a link to Jennifer Lawrence so we can still play 6 Degrees? Who know? The only problem is that, by rebooting it, they left a lot of the source history completely jumbled. The characters were largely left hanging and, though it worked for a while, the jumbled characters made the reboot franchise kind of fall apart in X-Men: Apocalypse.<br/><br/>So 7 of 10 IMDb stars. It was a solid movie and I loved that they took the time to reboot it in a way that would kill all my instant reboot hatred...but had they written it a little tighter, it could have lasted long as a killer franchise."
"tankace","9","1","1","15 June 2016"," The mutants are back!!
","X-men First Class came out in 2011 and it is a reboot-prequel of the original trilogy who end with the Last Stand ( what a dumb movie) and it is awesome . Until I see X-men Apocalypse I will review the installments of this franchise which with this flick came back from the dead!! To the film itself ,is set in the sixties during the Cuban Missile Crisis and we meet the younger versions of Magneto, Professor X, Mystique and Beast, who try to stop the World War III for happening. To the cast everyone plays his or her role close to excellent with James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender stealing the show.<br/><br/>What I liked was that they both want the best for their mutant brothers and sisters but the means they prefer are as far as it get ,dispute that their friendship is totally real. Bonus fact Fassbender is the better Magneto than Mackellen and I stand to my view!! To the rest Jennifer Lawrence ,before becoming Katniss ,plays Mystique and she rocks, you totally believe that she wants nothing more than to fill part of a bigger team ,the same goes for the Beast, who is my favorite character of the X-men since I can remember myself and his depiction here redeemed the character from his first appearance in the Last Stand. The only character that felt a little shallow were the team of the villain of the story, apart from Kevin Bacon who was the epitome of an arrogant, mad scientist,but it was not so bad to break the movie.<br/><br/>Now to the theme, because every superhero no matter who great ,over the top or Strange( for Dr Strange :)) he or she is has a theme ,which is the fuel for the actions that they do. Spiderman's is responsibility ,Batman's is justice, Punisher's is vengeance and so on. To the X-men the theme is as I previously wrote to find somewhere to belong and face the racism of the rest of the society because of their powers. And here we get it and then some ,with Magneto been the Malcom X and Professor been the Martin Luther King of this universe and in the end their view are both right!! ( Although personally team Magneto) <br/><br/>In summary the movie is great and its only weaknesses , which to find you must nit pick, it is the the villains ,except from the leader and their plan .But its strong parts is the rest characters , the action, the setting ( in 1963 the first X-men comic was published so they literally return back to the basic) and the alternate history from our own ,which the creators of the movie made. I like it due to it answer indirectly a big question ,what would the world today be like if heroes like that of the myths walk among us!!A thing of Beauty!! You should definitely see it if you have not already."

","X-Men: First Class (2011) is an Awesome Action superhero flick based on a comic book mythology of X-Men where it all begin. This film is close good as X2 it is my third best favorite X-Men film. I love this film! I love James McAvoy as Charles Xavier aka Profesor X later, I love Jennifer Lawrence as Raven/Mystique, I also love January Jones as Emma Frost and Michael Fassbender as Erik Lensherr alias Magneto. Gosh I love this film I was entertained from beginning till end. I love this movie, It is a great prequel to the X-Men movies James Mcavoy as young Xavier is great choice and everything of this movie is just Great.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence is amazing as Raven/Mystique I never saw her like that as been a good person, I always though she was bad. In First Class tells the story how everything was. How Eric and Charles become friends and later becomes enemies. The film is actually set from the first X-Men film when we see that boy in a Nazi camp in Poland it is the same scene from the first X-men Bryan Singer directed. X-men First Class is the best prequel movie that explains the X-men characters and their universe with a good back story. Vaughn struck gold casting McAvoy and Fassbender as Young Professor X and Magneto, these two stole the show, especially Fassbender as Magneto, he was amazing... X-Men First Class also had a great supporting cast with Kevin Bacon, Jennifer Lawrence, Rose Byrne, and January Jones. We are also introduced to a lot of new comers that played their roles perfectly.. The plot is pretty simple; we see how Charles and Erik meet and deal with their powers that they aren't comfortable dealing with because they are afraid society won't accept them, We also get to see how they eventually choose sides between good and evil! Which is very exciting, I know a lot of people (true Comic book readers) had issues with the actual choices of the First Class characters, but the ending of this movie will set up for those wanted characters to be in the sequel I'm sure, so hopefully the fanboys will ease up a little bit once production gets going on that! X-Men First class is up their as a top Comic Book movie adaptation and shouldn't be overlooked by anybody who is uneasy because of the past screw ups in the franchise. Just see this already if you haven't. <br/><br/>I love this origin film, the acting in here is superb, the action scenes are awesome. I love that the plot I set in 1962, that you can see Las Vegas in here. I love that Eric and Charles are getting all the mutants together in battle against Sebastian Shaw. There is Beast for the first time in it. We last saw him in X-Men: Last Stand.Showing Magneto's strength and powers what he can do is amazing. Matthew Vaughn did an awesome job as director of X-men he did amazing job directing my all time favorite film Kick-Ass (2010.)X-Men First Class is easily the best of the entire series. The movie is high-tech and well-acted, with lots of action and noise as it portrays the origins of the X-Men, a group of about a dozen mutants (so far). It begins in a Nazi prison camp, where young Erik Lehnsherr is forced to witness a tragedy and finds he can control metals with his mind — but only when he's angry. He grows up to become Magneto and is played by Michael Fassbender, the lean Irish actor who the buzzmeisters say will become a big star from this film. Heaven help him. He was so good in ""Fish Tank,"" ""Inglourious Bastards"" and ""Jane Eyre"" (2011): must he play Magneto to become a star? For that matter, Raven/Mystique is played by Jennifer Lawrence, just nominated for a best actress Oscar. Now she's a blue shape-shifter with scales. The price of stardom.<br/><br/>I love the plot on how they blend those characters from the beginning till those moments where you should be like ""whoa its that it for him?"" but its nice. Also I'm into the acting of the characters and damn kudos to Kevin Bacon & Michael Fassbender for just an awesome job on how they deliver the script into those characters. I mean just a big credit to those guys. The special effects are just awesome to the film as expected especially on the climax part. I love X-Men: First Class to death one of the best films ever made! <br/><br/>Following the classic Marvel mythology, X-MEN: FIRST CLASS charts the epic beginning of the X-Men saga. Before Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr took the names Professor X and Magneto, they were two young men discovering their powers for the first time. Before they were archenemies, they were closest of friends, working together with other mutants some familiar, some new, to stop the greatest threat the world has ever known.<br/><br/>X-Men: First Class is a 2011 American superhero film, based on the X-Men characters appearing in Marvel Comics. It is the fifth installment in the X-Men film series. It serves as a prequel of the franchise.

","Origin Stories are Really-Cool. It is the Foundation of All Mythology.

With the Single Super-Hero Concept the One Beginning Cannot Really be Changed That Much Without Causing Blowback of Behemoth Proportions.<br/><br/>This is Another Exciting, Extraordinary, Execution from the Marvel Universe. Setting the Film in 1962 and Wrapping it Around the Cuban Missile Crisis was Inspirational and the ""Brink of Nuclear War"" Plot Adds a Certain Depth to the Thing. Kudos to Director Matthew Vaughn Along with Some Great Casting and Flashy and Superb SFX from John Dykstra.<br/><br/>It Brings Along Social Commentary that is Delivered Amongst the Overwhelming Visuals Making it Easy to Absorb.

","As a kid, I collected some comics, mostly ADVENTURE from DC about the Legion of Super Heroes, some Superman, and from Marvel, some Fantastic Four.<br/><br/>DC was known as better heroes, while Marvel was known as ""better characters"".<br/><br/>In those days, those were about the only two real choices. The India Ink artistry was unbeatable. And it was the days before hacks began drawing pictures which had every hero with a 90 inch chest.<br/><br/>So, I'm not a die-hard comic fan, but I'm not a completely free agent, either. I see this film from both sides, roughly, but mostly from the middle.<br/><br/>This super hero film has something for everyone, I believe. It seems to stay fairly true to the comics, as I recall, certainly to the emphasis on characters.<br/><br/>For non comic fans, it has good characters.<br/><br/>The directing, I think, helps a lot. There really seems to be an emphasis on only two characters, with a brief attempt to show glimpses of three other characters, and a very small hint at four other characters at the very most. The others may as well be called ""Extra Number One, Two, and so forth"".<br/><br/>Really, it is about two characters. They aren't brothers, but they behave as brothers. They are in the founding father days of a super hero group.<br/><br/>Charles is the charismatic one, the one you would expect to be the older brother if they were brothers. He is mature and composed. He even reminds me of my older brother.<br/><br/>Alex is the more emotional one. He has a good heart, and has good intentions, but one could say he has a ""dark side"". He isn't evil, but he isn't ""good"". There is one time when I believe he crosses the line. They are teaching a young man how to use his power of vocalization to fly, and Alex pushes him to a certain doom if he doesn't use his voice correctly. In the comic world, it's acceptable as ""sink or swim"", but in ""sink or swim"", you can always toss a line to a drowning man. I suppose here that Alex had a back up plan to use his power to somehow save the poor boy if he ""sank"".<br/><br/>At the climax, Alex has a bout with Humanity, in which he seems to want to kill a beautiful young woman for a bullet that hits someone he cares for. He obviously never intends to really kill her, but to coax another character to stop him, as he takes his time. Many of us have been in this ""someone stop me"" situation before.<br/><br/>What I think is best is the work done on the five characters they explore. However, I think that's laziness for a full length film to only explore five characters to this degree. Even many of the ""heroes"" and ""villains"" are just fillers, basic extras.<br/><br/>What I didn't care for were the action scenes. Again, a film has to have something for everyone. And special effects are needed for the geeks. I did like the simplicity of some of them, however. This made it more of a good balance of action and character.<br/><br/>The weakest moments were the action moments. At one point, the villains wipe out the self important CIA team and the guards. It wasn't badly done. It was overly done, though. It seems to have been a case of ""lets give the dorks in the audience some more silly bloodthirsty killing scenes"". Fortunately, this was a small part of the film, and looked to be just an effort to appease the dorks.<br/><br/>The direction for establishing the two central characters was outstanding, no doubt about it. We get Alex and Charles in reaction to almost everything, sometimes in unison, sometimes in differences."

Superb entertainment delivered by Matthew Vaughn of Kick-ass fame, directing an engaging and dynamic cast. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender are entirely convincing at Xavier and Lehnsherr, and they have strong support throughout a well-constructed story from both A-listers and up-and-coming young stars alike. Jennifer Lawrence is again worthy of great plaudits essaying the troubled Mystique and January Jones is the screen equivalent of super glue to the eyeballs. Kevin Bacon has no trouble convincing as the personification of evil and the action hinges around his hideous masterplan, which is straightforward in its scope, but as usual with X-men it's the personal relationships where most of the real fireworks are flying.

It's a very good movie, I'm not going to say that it's excellent, there were a few things that I didn't like. But hell... I was smiling from ear to ear after the credits, I expected one more silly movie, and i got a very intelligent, funny, and with great performances movie. From the beginning it was very good, the Magneto's childhood and Xavier's were really interesting. Magneto's one put me back to the first X-Men movie, it brought me back so many memories. After that, I have to say that Michael Fassbender is the best of the movie, but he's not the only good thing, also James McAvoy was outstanding. There were a lot of good performances that made the movie very very enjoyable. the relationships between the characters were well placed and developed, as the one between Magneto and Xavier, between Mystique and Xavier, Mystique and Beast. The script was really good, nothing like the X-Men Origins: Wolverine that was awful. The movie is not perfect. It had its mistakes. But they are minutiae. Nothing that impede us to enjoy this great movie with great actors, and of course nice fx. You can almost cry with Xavier and Magneto in the scene where Professor X makes Erik remember his most happy/sad memory. You can identify yourself with the characters in a perfect way. They are very well constructed. This is one of those movies that makes you love it and remember it with affection."
"SheldonChau","8","1","1","23 July 2012"," X-Men: First Class (2011)
","X-MEN: FIRST CLASS does a lot of things right in providing smart and exciting entertainment with strong lead performances and a solid origin story. James McAvoy charms as a young Professor X as he brings both the charisma and intelligence required to portray the revered character in a genuine, respected, and eventually sympathetic manner. Likewise, Michael Fassbender commands the screen with his powerful presence as Magneto; he displays an impressive control of emotions, balancing a coolness when calm is needed with the pain and intimidation and anger that conflicts and fuels his character for much of the narrative. This film hinges on the quality of these two leading roles given the enormity and relevance of the two characters in the Marvel comic book lore. And as the film's highest marks, both McAvoy and Fassbender deliver. <br/><br/>With that said, the film, as entertaining as it may be, has its flaws. Kevin Bacon plays Sebastian Shaw with your typical supervillain destroy-the-world (or something similar) mentality in which he smirks and smiles and scoffs his way through the film. His henchmen are even more one-dimensional - an especially stoney performance from January Jones. Additionally, Vaughn can't help but include campy elements like his depiction of Cold War threats and visions, corny thick-headed generals, cliché military leaders barking out cliché orders in cliché environments - elements that add an excruciating cartoon factor to an otherwise smart narrative; flaws that dumb the film down by resorting to lazy developments that reflect the typical run-of-the-mill Hollywood blockbuster. These shortcomings are unfortunate since FIRST CLASS does offer a compelling story that delves deep into significant societal issues that include prejudice, race, and an us-vs-them mindset. These themes were always a strength of the X-Men universe and an asset that proves vital to this narrative arc, and Vaughn successfully nails it here. <br/><br/>In the end, FIRST CLASS is a very good movie that rises above its X-Men peers. It delivers a last act in which the acting, visual effects, and action come together to form a gripping and sufficient climax. Composer Henry Jackman's score also stands out and makes watching X and Magneto grow into their personas that much more riveting. Though the flaws are frustrating, Matthew Vaughn's film is still well-made and marks an auspicious new beginning for the franchise."

X-Men: First Class is an origin story for the X-Men, obviously, but the internal conflict in it makes it soar above other superhero movies. Charles (played by James McAvoy, who was great) and Erik (played by Michael Fassbender, who is fantastic in everything he's in) are both mutants, leading a team of other mutants - but at the same time, their personal philosophies differ so greatly that it gives a lot of tension to the film.<br/><br/>The performances in this film are all great - Jennifer Lawrence, Kevin Bacon, and Nicholas Hoult all stood out to me especially. The movie has great action and great dialogue as well. However, I thought certain moments were rushed, leading to some either awkward moments or really abrupt ones.<br/><br/>Overall, definitely see X-Men: First Class! I give it a 9."

","I've never been a big fan of the X-Men movies, but this is really a spectacular film.<br/><br/>The time period fit more to this kind of story than the others, as comics were a much bigger thing in the '60s, so it kind of felt right. It just worked. The acting was great, the action was pretty exciting, and the story was investing. I must say, the ending felt just a bit anticlimactic in comparison to the rest of the movie, but there was plenty of tension in it, and there's a moment that will make you shiver.<br/><br/>This is a fun, emotional movie. One about friendship, betrayal, acceptance, and going separate ways. It's not for everyone, but you'll probably enjoy yourself."
"jsaus63304","8","1","1","30 June 2012"," Surprisingly good-kind of a history lesson
","I grew up reading DC comics and lived through the Cuban missile crisis when I was in high school. Marvel comics came a little late for me, so I was unfamiliar with a lot of their characters. I have seen all the other X-Men movies and while I enjoyed them, I was a little lost in the characters, their powers and their origins. This movie, much like Batman Begins or Star Wars I, fills us in on the beginnings of characters that we have already been exposed to.<br/><br/>It is really neat that the writers weaved the missile crisis with historical clips into the story. Just as I was out of the era of the characters, the majority of viewers will be unaware that the crisis was very real and very serious. I just hope that they do not believe this is the way it was actually averted. Perhaps it will encourage a few viewers to look into the history of it and the Cold War of that era. While they are at it, since the beginning of the movie was set in a camp during the Holocaust, a look into that era and the mindset of a few people would add to your understanding of how the mental and emotional being could be affected by the experience.<br/><br/>For those who like action and special effects, they are all there and pretty well done. There is nothing there that I can remember saying that I have never seen anything like that before. The computer generated graphics do not have the pasted up look that you see in many attempts. The nice thing is that the movie does not consist of nothing but action and special effects-there is actually a decent story line. That in itself is becoming quite rate in most movies.<br/><br/>All in all, this was a good attempt to fill us in on how it all began. Obviously, the ending set us up for a sequel. I am looking forward to it to further fill me in on the story line from the earlier movies."
"axlrhodes","8","1","1","16 May 2012"," Another franchise reboot....but this one's good.
","After three X-Men films and a pretty poor origins story attempt for Wolverine in a film of the same name, i might be forgiven for feeling a little underwhelmed by the prospect of sitting down for over two hours and watching another reboot of a popular comic book franchise. Turns out, contrary to my expectations, i had a great time. This is an origins story that attempts to entertain you rather than bog you down with exposition. The film is surprisingly light on it's feet and has many fun action set pieces as well as some eye catching sets and sexy performances. Michael Fassbender shines for the good guys as Magneto while Kevin Bacon seems to be having the best time of his career in his role as a bad guy. My only disappointment was the performance of James McAvoy, i found his character hard to believe and more importantly, hard to like. Something just seemed a little forced. Full credit must go to Matthew Vaughn for pulling this off. I was a huge fan of Kick Ass and if it weren't for how much i loved that film, i may never have tried this. I'm glad i did."
"jackharding89-1","8","1","1","9 April 2012"," a loud and proud preface with balls and brains to spare.
","First class by name, first class by nature, this explosive chapter in the wilting X-Men film anthology is not just the best of the bunch by an absolute mile, it's also a complete game- changer. Following the abysmal Last Stand, it couldn't get much worse for mutant buffs. Then it did; the awful Wolverine origins tale of rise and maul was a daft and rushed affair rife with flaws and frailties. It was the Batman and Robin of X-Men movies. Back to the drawing board, then; the failing franchise in desperate need of its Batman Begins.<br/><br/>Enter Kick-Ass helmer Matthew Vaughn and co. with a heady and rousing cold-war embroiled script charting the genesis of the original mutant coalition lead by then chums Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and Erik Lehnsheer (Michael Fassbender). Before they were worn, sworn enemies and answered to Professor X and Magneto, the two forged an elite class of mutants to help bring down a band of baddies hell-bent on sparking World War 3. X-Men: First Class chronicles the events that made the early-day mutants X-Men fans know and love and love to hate while shedding light on some unfamiliar faces like nasty Nazi Sebastian Shaw (a dastardly Kevin Bacon) and the seductive Emma Frost (January Jones).<br/><br/>Featuring a horde of nods and groundwork to what lies ahead in both the comics and films, Vaughn's vision is an action-packed and highly satisfying benchmark in superhero cinema. Yeah, yeah, Chris Nolan's Batman renaissance may be the bee's knees but to class it in the superhero niche with the likes of First Class would be wrong. OK, they're both inspired renewals of mainstream material with top-class acting but ask yourself this; would you see a submarine being plucked from the sea by a magnetic man in a Batman movie? Exactly.<br/><br/>Over-the-top First Class undoubtedly is, then, but that's not to say it's ridiculous in its scope and execution when its context is considered. Set in the sixties and amongst the paranoia surrounding an imminent nuclear war, the film's historical backdrop helps establish an air of fidelity despite being pure baloney. There is plenty viewers can relate and refer to; prejudice, friendship, love, loss, anger, revenge, Nazis, the Cuban missile crisis, war and peace. <br/><br/>The brunt of the film's class lies within its cast, though; both McAvoy and Bacon give exceptional and highly-convincing character performances inside their taut and tailored roles but it's Michael Fassbender who owns all. Complex, tortured and conflicted to the core, who better to take on the vengeful Holocaust refugee than the intense and immense method man. The German born thesp of Irish descent turns in yet another absorbing performance of great concentration and great effort. His measured turns in the likes of Hunger, Fishtank and Inglorious Bastards ensured he earned the praise and respect of film buffs but seldom that of the mainstream. Until now. With this film and this performance, Fassbender can no longer be ignored. He could well be the best thing to happen to big-screen acting since Christian Bale. Expect more from him. It's rare for a film of this ilk be praised for its acting. Without it, the emotional impact and poise of key scenes would be lost. It's the best the action/adventure genre has had to offer since, you've guessed it, The Dark Knight.<br/><br/>X-Men: First Class is a spectacular slice of high-octane, globe-trotting cinema and is nothing short of a revelation that action film fans and X-Men nuts should ready themselves to marvel at; a loud and proud preface with balls and brains to spare. Add to that a chic and pulsating score, a wry Hugh Jackman cameo and the urgent need for a follow-up and you're left with two words. You know what they are; first...class."

","I am a huge fan of X-Men series, and I must say that X-Men: The First Class is my favorite of the all. At first, I didn't expect that much, but I absolutely enjoyed the movie and loved it after all! <br/><br/>New more kinds of X-men and mutants are awesome, and the past of Professor X and Magnito is so interesting. Especially about Magnito, I think this movie is successful to make the character more lovable and attractive. Watching the time Charles and Eric were close friends was very nice. It is described with delicacy and care, so that the movie is somewhat heart warming, and somewhat thrilling. The tragic past of Eric makes me understand why he so hates normal humans and how the figure Magnito was created. He is not an evil nor villain at all, but he should keep fighting. And i think the fact makes X-Men series more profound and cooler.<br/><br/>This movie clears everything up of the previous ones and contains a story about all of them, so it's meaningful for people who love X-Men. Now I am waiting for the next one. X-Men always feels good. <br/><br/>James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender were great actors to play Charles and Eric respectively. Kevin Bacon was the best. he was a real villain in the movie."
"shawneuser","8","1","1","6 March 2012"," The Best of the X-Men Franchise
","The X-Men series, after a great start, was so run into the ground starting with X2's ridiculous ending, that I wasn't even interested in seeing this in the theaters or on DVD. <br/><br/>Then, one night, I accidentally caught this on cable, and I was shocked by how good of a movie this is. It completely held my interest throughout, mostly thanks to Michael Fassbender and James McAvoy who were perfectly cast as the friends who would one day lead separate factions of mutants. <br/><br/>This movie is about THEM, and they carry it. McAvoy brings a charming playfulness to Professor X that you never saw coming while still having that determination to do right and good no matter the cost that you expect from the character. And his powers, little used in the original movies, are incredibly impressive. Fassbender at first blush would appear to be a one dimensional, out for revenge, character, but as the movie progresses, layers to his character are pealed back. No matter what he is doing, even when brutally disposing of someone, you never get the sense that there isn't a good man inside of him.<br/><br/>The two are unstoppable together, and yet, they are fated to oppose each other.<br/><br/>The birth of Magneto is not unlike Anakin turning to Darth Vader. There are definitely similarities completed by the donning of the helmet at the end. The difference is that this WORKS. It is believable that Erik would become Magneto, and you understand why he does. <br/><br/>It is also completely believable that Raven would join him, and that Xavier would let her go. Erik taught her that she could be who she was instead of searching for human acceptance. For Xavier, mutants being accepted by humans was always important. By letting that go and accepting Erik's view, Mystique was able to accept herself. <br/><br/>There simply wasn't time to give every mutant in the show a backstory; so I forgive the movie for that. Many of the mutants, like the bad guys, were there primarily for the action sets, and that is fine. Kevin Bacon is always a good bad guy and his Sebastian Shaw is truly a formidable bad. He had to be to stand up to Xavier and Erik. <br/><br/>I think his demise is one of the best villain kills in cinema. LOVED it. <br/><br/>Emma Frost was an underused character that ultimately served as little more than to add some sexiness to the movie. I am a little curious as to why she seems to have two mutations while everyone else has one, but I suppose its that way in the comics. <br/><br/>The backdrop of the 60s and the Cuban Missile Crisis gave this a real world conflict feel that I believe added to the uniqueness of the movie. If nothing else, it served as a constant reminder that this was a prequel. <br/><br/>I also like that Rose Bryne's character added a normal human to the X-men ranks. <br/><br/>Did the Wolverine cameo make sense? Doesn't the guy age? It was another strength of the movie that it didn't hinge on Wolverine. His character is relatable so he worked well as the main in the first movie, but he is too one-sided to be very interesting for long. I can sum Wolverine up in one sentence- I am always angry. That isn't going to hold my interest for 4 movies.<br/><br/>Props to Michael Fassbender and James McAvoy. You have made the X-Men great again."

","When I watched this film, I honestly expected it to be a load of codswallop. Seriously, another X-Men movie - and a prequel, no less! I went in with low expectations. But this film was pure awesome. Special effects are top notch, dialogue is intelligent, sequences are engaging, action is awesome, characters are very believable, the soundtrack is brilliant (it kept rolling through my head for months) and the list goes on. Fassbender's Magneto has some really good acting and very quotable quotes, while Xavier is pure coolness. The other mutants are also likable and there isn't really anything to complain about in this film as far as I can see,<br/><br/>Very possibly the best X-Men film."

","Director Matthew Vaughn, helmed for his Kick-Ass, has done it again. With a brand new set of actors (watch out for the special appearance of Logan), Matthew Vaughn has opened a fresh start from the X-Men trilogy. The story is well presented and James McAvoy truly is capable of representing Charles Xavier amongst others such as Jennifer Lawrence (Winter's Bone) as Raven. The music score is also truly entertaining as well as matches the scenes appropriately. <br/><br/>However, apart from its minor defects that many will tend to overlook, X-Men First Class is huge step forward from its dragging, mediocre & star-studded predecessor trilogy.<br/><br/>Therefore, don't hesitate to watch this film in the cinema.

","First: I love SF and Fantasy. So does my son. We've been to this movie in the cinema, as we've seen the previous movies, with positive anticipation. However, the director seemed to find it necessary to bring in some light and totally misplaced humor, like the encounter of the younger Xavier and Magneto with Wolverine. The characters - though in line with the other X-men movies - were superficial and bland. While there was a certain allure to the story, it was also a cliché; the Nazis were evil again (like an Indiana Jones movie).<br/><br/>Furthermore, the film was ripe with impossibilities (such as the Blackbird lifting the submarine). Obviously a matter of cinematic freedom has been applied, but combined with the other factors it caused us (and the entire cinema) to laugh at serious bits of the movie.<br/><br/>We also felt that the cinematic effects were not as spectacular as the previous movies (for example the diamond woman).<br/><br/>All-in-all, the movie was entertaining and certainly a must for the die-hard x-men fan, but it fades in comparison with the previous installments. It felt like a quick wrap-up and a little cliché."

"tomgillespie2002","6","4","9","12 June 2011"," Rushed and unspectacular, saved by Michael Fassbender
","Things were looking good for the X-Men back in 2003. The first film was a box-office success and was a pretty solid blockbuster. Then X2 came and the bar was raised not only for X-Men films, but for superhero movies in general. Bryan Singer had made an exciting action film that had interesting, fully-developed and endearing characters. Then Singer dropped out in order to make Superman Returns, and for some reason left the job to Hollywood s**t-stain Brett Ratner. X-Men: The Last Stand was an over-populated, lazily directed mess, and Ratner had thought it would be a good idea to cast Vinnie Jones. It seemed to be the closure of the X- Men series, until X-Men Origins: Wolverine came along and gave a backstory to fan-favourite Wolverine. Even though it was directed by the Oscar-winning Gavin Hood (who directed the excellent Tsotsi), it was the worst of the lot. Studio interference has made it a bumbling, boring mess of a movie. But still the X-train carries on, and still had the ability to attract rising director Matthew Vaughn.<br/><br/>Set in 1962, it follows a young Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) who is graduating from University and living with his best friend Raven (Jennifer Lawrence). Xavier is seemingly fascinated with genetic mutation that has given him the gift of reading minds, and given Raven the ability to morph into anyone. Meanwhile, vengeful concentration camp survivor Erik Lensherr (Michael Fassbender) is on a mission to find the fled Nazis that led to the death of his parents, and, ultimately, to find Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon), who first discovered his gift for magnetism. Shaw is now on a quest to strike a deal with the U.S.S.R. that will lead to the destruction of America. Lensherr realises he must join forces with Xavier and recruit new mutants in order to fight this threat, and eventually being accepted into a discriminative world.<br/><br/>One of the underlying themes of the X-Men films is the idea of discrimination against the mutants. It is the key thing that eventually lead to Xavier and Lensherr (later to become Professor X and Magneto) ultimately becoming enemies. Xavier feels that the best way to show the human population that the mutants do not pose a threat is to rise above the 'racial' hatred. Magneto takes it as a way to feel superior, and therefore hell-bent on teaching the humans a lesson. Magneto feels deeply about this due to his childhood in Auschwitz, and the death of his parents. This deep-rooted hatred is explored early on in First Class as Lensherr scours Europe killing people on his Nazi list.<br/><br/>This is one of the problems with First Class, as the film is bound to the fate that we as the audience already know. Xavier must lose the use of his legs. Magneto and Raven (later to become Mystique) must become evil. Hank McCoy (Nicholas Hoult) must turn into Beast. The Cerebro must be built. Often the film becomes so insistent in developing these ideas that it loses focus on its own storyline and characters. As a result, the plot can often feel muddled, and the new mutant additions are thinly-conveyed and uninteresting.<br/><br/>The one true masterstoke in the film is the casting of Michael Fassbender. I've long been an admirer after seeing him as Bobby Sands in Hunger, and then go on to make Fish Tank and Inglourious Basterds. He portrays Magneto torn both by anger and helplessness devised from his childhood, and plays it with utter conviction. His early scenes travelling across Europe are the best moments in the film, and makes me wish they had gone ahead with their earlier plans in giving Magneto his own origin movie. McAvoy, however, although possessing a lot of charm, suffers from having Patrick Stewart's shoes to fill. His friendship with Raven is just not convincing.<br/><br/>There's a definite feeling that the film has been rushed. Vaughn's earlier efforts in the fantasy field - Kick-Ass and Stardust - flowed, and never lacked in the special effects department. Here, the film seems to frantically pacing for the climax, with no real moments of character development, and some of the special effects don't come near to the standards of other films these days. It is, though, undoubtedly enjoyable. The action scenes don't exactly blow anything out of the water, and don't even surpass the original two, but they are at least fun. I hope if they do make another film, they concentrate on the story rather than looking at the future, and set the foundations for what could become a solid franchise in it's own right.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"

"bobthegrinch","5","4","9","11 June 2011"," Not bad but the reviews have been kind
","I'm a fan of Mattthew Vaughans work. I can take or leave layer cake but Kick Ass was entertaining and I love Stardust. Initially I believed him to be a great choice to direct a new x-men film. My enthusiasm was dampened somewhat as details about the film began to emerge but the relentless tide of positive reviews led me to believe that this indeed was getting the X-men franchise (depending on your opinion) on or back on track. Well they're half right.<br/><br/>What this film does get right is the dynamic and the essence of Magneto and Xaviers relationship and McAvoy and Fassbender deliver the goods. The casting of these two roles is, for my money, the films greatest success.<br/><br/>However Magneto's turn to the dark side is presented as a reaction to a certain character and the Nazi regime. He is so consumed by his quest for vengeance in light of what they did. However his response to the atrocities committed against him and the emotional trauma caused, in light of his intelligence and the genuine emotional affection he displays for his friends doesn't, for me, chime with his decision to pretty much adopt a Nazi philosophy of destroying a race he deems primitive next to his own by the end of the film. I know that we have to get to the point where Magneto does hate humans, but, if he's adopting the philosophies of those he's spent his life hating, I feel we need to see him pushed further than he is in this film.<br/><br/>In fact the last 40 minutes of the film is busy rushing through events to get them in line with our idea of who these characters are and not giving characters enough space to breathe. As a result almost every other character disappears into the background and makes little to no impact. The exceptions being Mystique, an okay performance and the only other character with any depth, and to a lesser degree Hank McCoy. Unfortunately, Mystique's 'mutant and proud' rhetoric and while her point of view is understandable, the constant repetition of 'mutant and proud' gets clunky and seems a little heavy handed and she turns her back on her best friend without really feeling any guilt, even though he's bleeding out and has just lost the use of his legs. Beast gets more screen time than the other X-lings, however the script allows the absolute minimum character development possible. The dialogue literally spells out the motivation for his actions but it happens over the course of a few brief scenes and it feels motivated more by a film makers need to get him blue and hairy than because we feel the characters discomfort with being different is that extreme or emotionally affecting.<br/><br/>Beyond that those points, there's little to talk about. There aren't any bad performances in the film but no other characters get enough depth or time on screen to make an impact or make us care. The villains in particular are very shallow. Kevin Bacon brings nothing special to a forgettable role, I can't claim to remember Sebastian Shaws reasons for anything he does, but he's serviceable. Emma Frost disappears half way through the film and seems completely wasted in this (at one point she is put in a position that she is shown to be capable of getting out of but for some unexplained reason doesn't). I can't understand the choices behind the other underwhelming villains. Azazel does the scrapping we see in the trailer but fails to excite in action the way Nightcrawler did in X2. Riptide has a power that is visually uninteresting and I don't think speaks while Angel Salvadore is a bewildering choice as her powers seem visually and practically pathetic. If you're going to cast villains who, ultimately, do nothing but fight, I don't understand why you wouldn't pick the more visually interesting or those who's powers would make for more exciting action scenes. Had to cut your fight in the mind sequence because it's similar to Inception? Why not replace Riptide and Angel with characters that would allow you to show us something we haven't seen before? The action in the film is perfectly serviceable but it lacks any tension and is pretty uninvolving. I don't remember being wowed at any moment in this film.<br/><br/>All in all it's not a bad film, but the reviews have been kind. I'll still look forward to Matthew Vaughans work, but X-men first class represents the closest he's come to a miss step for me. This would've worked better if it had focused more on Charles and Xavier and not bogged itself down with trying to show us the formation of the X-men and including a lot of events and characters they didn't have time to cover properly."

"faisal_khatib","8","4","9","9 June 2011"," Kudos to Matthew Vaughn for bringing this stale franchise back to life.
","Prequels are so flawed in their concept that they suffer from the feeling of predictability. This can weigh down a film if it isn't one that gives its viewers a ride of a life time. X-Men: First Class not only stays afloat, but shines at that with some thrilling action/emotions, a tight script, fantastic chemistry between the lead actors and excellent special effects.<br/><br/>First Class was always about establishing the base to the original trilogy but the way this was done is remarkable. The movie starts out with a prologue staged during WWII that shows the childhood of Charles Xavier (Laurence Belcher) growing up in the comforts of home in New York while discovering his power and a little sister/friend in the form of Raven (played by Morgan Lily), and Erik Lehnsherr (Bill Milner) locked up in a concentration camp where he meets doctor Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) who kills Erik's mother to force a magnetic reaction out of him fueled by rage.<br/><br/>Fast forward to the 1960's with the Cuban Missile crisis around the corner, Charles (James McAvoy) is en-route to becoming a professor of genetics while Erik (Michael Fassbender) is clawing his way towards Shaw for revenge. What follows next are a series of events that results in Charles saving Erik's life. Thus begins the drama between the two lead characters that is the heart of the movie. The chemistry they share with their humorous interaction, their clash of ideologies and their general perspective of the future is beautifully scripted.<br/><br/>The character transition from a proud but naïve Xavier to selfless Professor X; an angry and confused Erik to a powerful Magneto and an unsure Raven to a proud mutant Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) is handled with utmost care and aptness. The casting was spot on with all three actors delivering a convincingly flawless act.<br/><br/>Support comes in the form of Hank McCoy aka Beast (Nicholas Hoult) whose constant struggle (along with Raven) to undo his physical mutation for better acceptance into the society is a shot at how humans perceive, alienate and fear anyone with visible or invisible abnormalities. Nicholas Hoult as the geeky super intelligent Hank is believable and it was great to see this child artist mutate into a full grown actor. Him as Beast was a letdown as the makeup seemed to be a hindrance for dialogue delivery plus his act wasn't as convincing as Kelsey Grammar in X-Men: The Last Stand.<br/><br/>Moira MacTaggert (Rose Bryne) is the sole human connection in the movie who believes that there is indeed something good that can come from the mutant race. Sean Cassidy/Banshee (Caleb Landry Jones) is the nervous teenager unable to channel his powers and unsure how he could use it to do any good. Caleb looks and acts the part though his action scenes were a little unimpressive. Alex Summers/Havok (Lucas Till) is the volatile one due to the lack of control over his powers. Not much acting was required from Lucas apart from making sneer comments and looking pretty, which he did quite well. Armando Muñoz/Darwin (Edi Gathegi) was a short act and Edi impressed.<br/><br/>Moving on to the dark side, Sebastian Shaw through money, mutant powers and fear, puppeteers the American and the Russian governments/army to make moves enraging each other towards an eminent nuclear war that would destabilize humankind. Kevin in the opening scene as the doctor in the concentration camps is manically brilliant with what sounded like perfect German. Unfortunately his character as the *energy sucking* mutant was a 'typical super hero film villain' but then that is what he was.<br/><br/>Emma frost (January Jones) as Shaw's mind reading crystallizing side-kick was like watching a plank with curves. Her lingerie scenes make up for the eye candy of the film and that's about it, there's nothing more to her character. Janos Quested/Riptide (Álex González) and Azazel (Jason Flemyng) were Shaw's henchmen; lots of mutant action but not much say, which was a waste of two good actors. Riptide didn't have a single line in the whole film. Angel Salvadore (Zoë Kravitz) was the 'good girl gone bad' mutant who wants to stop hiding. Apart from being an angry/abused girl there wasn't more to her character either.<br/><br/>As expected, there are plenty of action scenes in the film, giving each character enough time to show off their powers. The graphics and visuals are spectacular as well, though the soundtrack takes a backseat in comparison. There are a couple of cameo roles in the film as well, one of which induces big laughs from the audience with just one line.<br/><br/>Director Matthew Vaughn's choice to give utmost importance to the relationship between Xavier and Erik; their verbal battles and inevitable differences has managed to make this movie more than just a comic book action film. Even the uncertainty Hank and Raven share is a nice side story that makes you feel their anguish and connection. Vaughn's ability to create a whole new universe with a mixture of facts and fiction makes you wonder what really happened in reality. Kudos to him for bringing this stale franchise back to life."

","X-Men: First Class takes us on a strange journey. It takes us back to the land of ""might have been"".<br/><br/>The source material has been doing this for years, of course. Alternate timelines, possible Earths, parallel universes are old hat for the X-Men. Heck, some of their members come from such times and places. But the cinematic X-Men have more or less avoided such toys.<br/><br/>Until now. Ignoring X-3 and Origins: Wolverine (no. stop. don't. police.), the film postulates and explores missed opportunities. The tragedy of roads not taken. And it does this all without Wolverine hogging the screen! (Not to say that there just might be a cameo of some sort, bub.) By taking this unconventional approach, the franchise has not just been rejuvenated, I believe that it raises the bar for live action super-hero films in general.<br/><br/>Magneto and Professor X. They were friends, once. But who was responsible for the creation of whom? Why are they each other's arch-foes? Let's travel back to 1962 and find out, shall we? The young, spoiled Charles Xavier we meet has lived a life of privilege and wealth. His powers are easily hidden. If anything, he's more interested in using them to chase women and score educational opportunities than change the world for the better.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, a mysterious man named Erik is systematically traversing the globe, hunting down the men who made his childhood a living hell.<br/><br/>Both end up on a collision course when they run afoul of the enigmatic Sebastian Shaw, the self-appointed ""Black King"" of mutantkind, who's rapidly manipulating world events to the point that the Children of the Atom just may be the only living things left.<br/><br/>Charles' and Erik's respective arcs consume most of the film, but much focus is also had on Hank McCoy and Raven Darkholme, perhaps better known as Beast and Mystique. Neither can go out in the world without hiding what they truly are. Both long to be normal.<br/><br/>But is their freakish appearance truly a curse? Do they need to be ""cured""? Or do they need to be proud? The tragic results of their haphazard experiments with being normal drive the points the film wishes to make home just as powerfully as Erik magnetically drives his points home in certain intense scenes.<br/><br/>Don't be mistaken. This movie, despite the teen goofing, 60s spy film cool, and general bright production design gets very dark before the end.<br/><br/>And it's unafraid to take this darkness to its logical conclusion.<br/><br/>We may mourn for Beast and Mystique's relationship being starcrossed. We may sigh and shake our heads at Charles' foolishness in not understanding just the wrong things to say to a man on the brink.<br/><br/>But the irony is, these same failures create hope, and heroism, where before was only hedonism and hidden villainy.<br/><br/>The final truth: By having his youthful blinders ripped away, his legs crippled, and his friendship betrayed, Xavier finally understands what a terrible place the world actually is. And this gives him the fire he needs to be a shining light of goodness in it.<br/><br/>By damning himself, Erik creates the method by which the world may ultimately be saved.<br/><br/>This is deep, mythic story-telling here. It's the sort of fresh start Marvel's mutants needed. Here's looking to much more to follow.<br/><br/>(Originally appeared at http://fourthdayuniverse.com/reports)"

","OK here we are then: a superb trilogy under our belt, an excellent Wolverine prequel. What are the odds that the latest X-Men movie can maintain the excitement, enthralment and style we've grown to love? Absolutely no question - bang on the money! (Take notes Disney - PoC4.)<br/><br/>First Class really, really is just that. An epic background story to explain the characters we know and define some new ones we want to know more. Extremely well-acted (even though the younger selves had HUGE boots to fill re Patrick Stewart and Sir Ian McKellan) - simply brilliant. I CANNOT wait for the DVD or the next (hopefully also) brilliant movie, so I'll be using my telepathic powers to convince some younger family members that they should really go and watch this movie and, OK then, if I have to go with them (tut) so be it!"

","A revealing prequel to the X-Men saga. Unlike any movie of the trilogy, this one has a decent plot and good characters development. Indeed, it allows us to discover how everything unfolded and why the characters are in the predicaments that they are in the trilogy. Many of the characters that we have in the X-men trilogy are replaced by younger actors in order to fit the story which is happening in the past. For instance, James McAvoy has taken over Patrick Steward as Professor Charles Xavier and Michael Fassbender as a young Magneto. Together they both offer a different and new perspective on the rivalry those two characters have towards one another. Highly Recommended!"

","I never was much interested in comic book action movies. But Chris Nolan got my attention in the Batman series. Then Mathew Vaughn's Kick-ass became one of my favorites. Then when I heard he was making a x-men prequel, I decided to see the trilogy. <br/><br/>And thank god I did... This movie was one of the most stylish, brilliant and cool movie in years. But otherwise, the experience of it was remarkable. Charles Xavier and Erik's character were very well performed(they are my favorite in the entire series). The movie surprisingly is less in action and more in drama and that makes it more powerful. Bryan Singer did a good job on the story. But it somehow doesn't do justice to the original trilogy. But then, who cares? This movie begs to be enjoyed in the highest quality. <br/><br/>The music is rocking and has a great feeling about it. The cinematography makes it more clean and sharp. The whole Production is good. <br/><br/>Action movies on comics have always been fair. But I think the era is changing now.... X-men is the best comic according to me because it is metaphorically similar to the ""special ones"" in our own human society. And battles did take place for the same reason in reality. X-men First Class depicts this beautifully through the friendship of two mutants who eventually end up as foes. <br/><br/>Truly First Class... 9/10 (I took off one star point just because the story has some loop-holes. No spoiler!)"
"Snakethemidget","6","3","6","4 October 2011"," Marvel struggles to be deep
","Ever since Watchmen hit the markets, movie makers have began to re-make their super-hero movies but this time with the intention of making the movie deep and a bit philosophical... I call these movies Super-Heroes for Adults.<br/><br/>Watchmen was one extreme of such movies where the character driven philosophies presented were most primary compared to the action or the plot in general... X men is the opposite extreme. X-men had one philosophical idea to present which was that natural selection would favor the more fit new mutant species and the movie is the genesis of the Humans VS mutants battle for survival. This is the best and if not the only good thing about the movie (the scene with hugh jackman was a nice touch). <br/><br/>The acting was horrific if not worse than Christian Bale in Dark Knight. Beast, Mystique, Laser dude, screaming dude and most of all the butterfly girl were absolutely terrible if not laughable, while the rest where okay. The scene where butterfly girl decides to change teams and instantaneously becomes perfectly okay with the idea of starting a 3rd world war and wiping out the whole human race was one of cinema's worst acted scenes in history. They all change from being alienated kids to Hitlers and Stalins (Including mystique who even had to dump her brother).<br/><br/>Not even a slight sign of any thought process or emotion is displayed by each and every character that switched teams (be it in the beginning or in the end) with the exception of Magneto (the only consistent character in the whole movie).<br/><br/>Also, the manner by which the world war almost began is very unconvincing. Threatening to kill army generals or seducing them with imaginary sex is by no means enough incentive for them to start a nuclear war that will end the world.. also .. do these generals run the country? and why do they even meet with the guy? <br/><br/>The plot is extremely predictable and poor. The dialogue is generally dry and spoon-feeding the viewer through repetition of the same idea (New species VS Old) over and over and over again. The action is okay if not less than the previous X-men movies. <br/><br/>All in all the movie is entertaining and only slightly more deep then previous ones (but definitely worse acted) so its worth the time. Dark Night and Watchmen are better in every single aspect. I am afraid of how bad the next spiderman will be."

It spoils all good things about sequels.<br/><br/>I love X-Men 1 and 2 so having Bryan Singer involved here is only thing that made me watch this movie. But 2 things are starting to get in a way to make these movies better.<br/><br/>First is 2nd world war and Cold war inspiration for a plot. Second is unpleasantly weak acting job by James McAvoy. Reason is for such a great mentor he is suppose to be hi is very unconvincing. Remember he is training people with amazing, often lethal powers. He lacks presence authority you can feel. In contrast to that Patric Stewart performed this part perfectly. And as main actor here that is why this movie failed despite the all good things about it. Michael Fassbender is one that did best acting here.<br/><br/>All else is good action, effects, even screenplay is surprisingly interesting for Hollywood standards these days. And potential is there. Will see if next one is going to be better as this one feels in no way connected to sequels."
"DarthVoorhees","Null","3","6","24 September 2011"," Tough...
","I don't know what to think about 'X-Men First Class'. It's a film I've thought a great deal about because I am a fan of the comic book film genre and especially the X-Men. It's a film that has some great strengths but also a major problem which has been bothering me with repeat viewings of the film. There are moments in 'X- Men First Class' which match the best the comic book genre has to offer. Ultimately though the strengths and weaknesses of the film come from my favorite character of the series, Magneto.<br/><br/>I believe Magneto might just be the best comic book character ever even rivaling Batman. If comic books are the modern day form of tragic melodrama than Magneto is the greatest character to come out of this idea. He is so compelling a character with such clear and cut motives and is in this case played so compellingly by Michael Fassbender in an absolutely brilliant performance that I think he really could have stood alone here. I would pay to see a picture of Magneto hunting down Nazi and developing his Mutant ideology, which I expect the proposed X-Men Origins Magneto would have dealt with. Fassbender is absolutely brilliant in the role. He exposes a vulnerability, frailty, and rage that really befits this great character. Through the course of the X-Men mythology I find myself agreeing with Magneto ideologically more so than Professor X and this film is no exception. Fassbender's performance is as good as anything we have ever seen in a comic book film maybe on par with some of the performances in 'The Dark Knight' if a comparison is needed.<br/><br/>The problem is Professor X while we do get a great performance from James McAvoy comes across as weak. I find it kind of odd that someone like Xavier has the nads to give Magneto life lessons. While Xavier was picking up chicks awkwardly in the pub in England Magneto was in a quest for retribution. Xavier just kind of comes across as a spoiled brat in this film. He offers nothing to this partnership because Magneto is by far the more mature and learned character. McAvoy's Xavier spends a great deal of the film infatuated with a stupid cut out CIA character called Moira MacTaggert. Why? I don't know, she's so incredibly bland other than her groovy auburn hair. I don't identify with this Professor X in the least and the Mystique origin only adds to it. What kind of person would do that to his best friend and almost sister? McAvoy is less than subtle in showing Xavier's fear of Mystique's true nature. Perhaps showing Xavier's flaws was necessary in developing the character. I don't think any sensible audience member engaged in this story would choose Professor X over Magneto and the film asks you to pick a side in the sand. The choice is so incredibly clear here.<br/><br/>And yet it isn't...unfortunately so. 'X-Men First Class' biggest problem is its ending and in order to give my opinion of the film I have to indulge in some pretty big spoilers. Kevin Bacon's Sebastian Shaw is a really decent villain to a certain point. I love the fact that he is a Nazi. I love the fact that he plays the stupidity of the Cold War and American and Soviet representatives to his advantage. And what is more relevant is that he is the one who caused Magneto so much pain and shaped his views on humankind for the absolute worst. This really perfectly builds up to a final confrontation between Magneto and Shaw and what happens in this climactic moment? Shaw is given the entirety of Magneto's mantra to the point where Magneto's only retort is ""I agree with everything you just said but unfortunately you killed my mother""... this infuriated me as a viewer and fan of this character. Essentially you have throw away Magneto's entire motivation, his entire view of the world, his mission to save the mutants from another holocaust, and threw them away in favor of a really insignificant revenge story. I don't care about Magneto's mother other than the fact that her death made him see the world in a different light. What you do by giving Shaw Magneto's mantra is make the Magneto character useless. You say Magneto is no different than this sadist Nazi only he had to get rid of the person who killed his Mommy. No! I couldn't take that especially after Fassbender created such an interesting character. And the thing that gets me is that this could have been solved by making a few simple changes. Would it not make more sense for Shaw to be in it for himself? To have this new utopia from nuclear holocaust emerge with him as it's unquestionable leader? Wouldn't Shaw be even more evil if he wanted to rule OVER mutants instead of with them? Then Magneto could be vindicated in his wanting to protect his new found race with Xavier. You still could have Xavier and Magneto falling out over the same basic thing in the end and the movie would still work and even work better! <br/><br/>I think I was more forgiving in the sense that I sought a sequel but I really doubt there will be one. McAvoy and Fassbender are too big stars to indulge an X-Men series. By the end of this film Magneto and Xavier have drawn their lines in the sand for good. I would have liked to have thought there would be more to this friendship that it could develop and nurture itself and eventually have a bad falling out. In essence Magneto and Xavier are the best of friends for two weeks and become enemies right away. Unfortunately and it is so disappointing to say Magneto's side is Shaw's side and he became everything he supposedly hated and that is tragic."

"Christian_Dimartino","9","3","6","16 July 2011"," The best one yet.
","I have been a hardcore X-men fan since the beginning of the series, so going into X-men: First Class I had unanswered questions. Why is Xavier in a wheel chair? Why are Magneto and him enemies? Thats the premise of the latest film, and director Matthew Vaughn answers all of the questions.<br/><br/>James Mccavoy and Michael Fassbender are excellent choices for Xavier and Magneto. The film shows how they first met. Xavier was friends with Mystique(Jennifer Lawrence) and he believed in the greater good. Magneto wasn't a bad person. He just wanted revenge on Sebastian(the wickedly evil Kevin Bacon), a Nazi who becomes too power mad.<br/><br/>Magneto and Xavier team up together to make a mutant school, and with the help of a government agent(Rose Byrne), they try to take care of wrong doers, and well, The Cuban Missle Crisis believe it or not. And you are hooked.<br/><br/>Vaughn takes the time to study the characters. Its the longest film in the series yet, and that because Vaughn has a lot of story to tell. The acting all around is triumphant, especially from McCavoy, Fassbender, Lawrence, and Bacon. They bring depth to these characters, and you care about them deeply.<br/><br/>I think that X-Men: First Class is the best X-men film yet, and I was pleasantly surprised because I thought it looked cheesy. But I really liked it. It answered all of the questions i've wanted answered since the beginning, and unlike X-men: The Last Stand, it takes its time getting to know the characters.<br/><br/>Though I won't deny that it drags on a little, First Class is exciting and thrilling and is definitely one of the Summer's grandest films so far. X-men hasn't been better, and I liked every film so far. I hope Vaughn returns for another one, because if there's been five, there's got to be more where this came from.<br/><br/>A-"

"melgarcia40","9","3","6","5 July 2011"," Just a blockbuster summer action movie, but what a blast!
","For all people complaining about X-Men: First Class, one must not forget that, first and foremost, it's supposed to be a summer movie, not an art-house one. As Mr McAvoy says it himself, it's not supposed to change the world, it's supposed to be fun and entertaining. And for this, X-Men First Class completely achieves its goal.<br/><br/>I'll start with the quibbles: a few crappy lines, characters underused (Havok, Banshee, Darwin...), and some really bad CGI at times (Beast is particularly botched), and some hardcore fans will complain about (very minor) inconsistencies, etc ;but in comparison to the overall greatness of the movie, I can easily close my eyes.<br/><br/>The directing is nice, could have been a little more audacious, but fine nonetheless. The script is good, and the setting of the action in the sixties, intertwining mutants and history during the Cold War was a fantastic idea. It gave the opportunity to the set and costume designers to have fun to recreate a James Bond-alike atmosphere, and visuals that are just delicious.<br/><br/>The movie cleverly mimics X-Men opening scene, with the young Magneto i AUschwitz, and provides a great back story as well as some witty answers to some of the questions that arose from the first movies (it is important to note that this movies doesn't take the 3rd and 4th ones, which is great since they were both horrendous movies).<br/><br/>Now, discussing First Class without mentioning the cast is impossible, since this is really where the movie surpasses all the previous four.<br/><br/>Kevin Bacon as a villain is, unsurprisingly, an epic win. As usual, he is a master when it comes to portraying evil sly characters, and he was also great speaking German and Russian in this one (not pitch perfect, OF COURSE, but still, it was great to have him ACTUALLY say the lines and not being dubbed).<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence and Nicholas Hoult did a very good job in portraying teenage angst, insecurity and self-loath, they made their subplot really engaging.<br/><br/>But it is obviously the two leads, James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender that shine during the whole movie, they are just stellar, even if, considering the focus put on the characters, Fassbender is the one the steals most of the show. He is impeccable as Magneto, conveying his anger, sorrow, darkness and desire for revenge with sheer perfection. However, MvAvoy's part was a much subtler one, less showier, but all in nuances, and it's simply a delight to watch his dashing, rubbish-flirt, yet empathic version of the young Xavier. Therefore, when the two share the screen, it's just dynamite: their chemistry and talent irradiate and lift up the whole movie.<br/><br/>All in all: this is not a ""great movie"" on a philosophical point of view, but it's a real great moment of entertainment supported by an outstanding cast."
"fivefour192000","2","3","6","18 June 2011"," Dreadful.
","Two things, first: <br/><br/>1. I LOVE X-Men, both comics and movies. Always have.<br/><br/>2. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender are spared from this, because they were fine. Great, in fact. The best thing about this movie is when the two of them are on the screen at the same time.<br/><br/>With that said, there are no words for how disappointed I was in this film. When I first heard of the movie, I was a little excited, though not that interested in an origin story. Saw the previews, thought it looked terrible. But then I heard great things, from people I trusted. So I go, and by the end of the movie, I was laughing at the utter stupidity of the film.<br/><br/>The script is more than terrible, and when you add in a cast like this (again, except McAvoy/Fassbender), it gets even worse. There was just no care or emotion inspired in me for any of the other characters in the film, at all--I'm looking at you, January Jones, Jennifer Lawrence, Oliver Platt, and Edi Gathegi. Then, by the end, it devolves into a near-farcical level of parody. <br/><br/>The best thing about X-Men, both in comic and earlier movie form, was that it was preachy without ever SEEMING preachy. It always had such a good story with such great character dynamics that you never really felt like you were being drilled over the head with something. But (spoiler here) if I had to hear Jennifer Lawrence say with her creepy, childish gumption ""Mutant and proud"" one more time, I might have died of laughter.<br/><br/>The effects are nice, and the direction is well thought out, at least (even if the editing/sound/music do their best to try and ruin even that). Put it this way, regarding the editing of the film: there was more than one time when I pulled out the old line from MST3K: ""Scene budget must have ran out."" It just stops mid-scene and cuts to something else, sometimes completely unrelated to the previous one. <br/><br/>All in all, I'm starting to think that I'm the crazy one. Normally, I agree with the majority of critical opinion, both from my friends and from this site. But I'll say this, and despite being a person prone to hyperbole, I'm being as serious as I can: if I never see a movie this bad at the theater ever again, I'll be happy."

Apparently I have to write 10 lines (a bit like at school), so I have to 'flesh out' my one-word opinion. I really only wanted to say it was ""crap"" because that word summed it up so well .... less is more. The actors mostly seemed like a bunch of amateurs with a set of special powers dreamt up by a 7 year-old. The girl with the wings looked like someone out for a hen party. And I thought they said earlier in the film that the girl who changed into ice could not do it again because of what they did to her .... but she did it again later!

The script writing is absolutely dreadful. And I am a scriptwriter and director myself. The dialogue is the finest from someone who just dropped out of high school. Don't get me wrong. The film has some great action scenes. But this is only a few. VERY FEW. This isn't deliberate to make the ending more suspenseful. The whole film is filled with melancholia of social isolation and 'your beautiful just the way you are' conversations.<br/><br/>For those who say this is the best out of the trilogy... they are just saying that because it's a film that makes the X-Men's past official. But you could even guess how they have become X- men. It doesn't really introduce you to anything different. <br/><br/>I love comic book films, and I've never really disliked one. But I did for this one. Trust me, the only characters that are somewhat enjoyable are two main actors that is plays by Prof. X and Magneto. However, with a girl who's talent is being a bug shooting spit fires, or a man being able to only scream loud, and a guy to creates whirl winds (storm copy) seems like an excuse to show off ridiculous talents to make things even between good and evil. <br/><br/>If you're a fan of the comic and film culture, you might wanna give this hire.

If you look at the X-Men comic books they fought a wide variety of villains, each with their own different agenda- unfortunately in this movie every villain has the same agenda just as before- destroy the human race- like, how many times has that been done? Why not just watch the first 3 X-Men movies? Why bother with this? <br/><br/>Prof X (James McAvoy) now is younger, can walk and has hair and is a free-loving hipster in the 60's while Magneto (Michael Fassbender) is a suave, James Bond-like assassin. Director Matt Vaughn tries a new retro look for a 60's era reboot of the franchise but unfortunately it falls back to the same clichés that screwed up the franchise in the first place- namely that the movies are totally different than the comic books they are based on. If you look at the best comic book movie adaptations such as Raimi's Spider Man or Nolan's Batman movies they are very faithful to the source material.<br/><br/>The X-Men franchise is almost totally different from its roots: with the exception of Beast this X-Men team is completely different from the X-Men's first class of the comic books (Havok is supposed to be Cyclop's younger brother but here it seems he is more like his father and his powers are completely different- and inexplicable and not to mention that his back story is never revealed so you don't even know how he fits in to all of it)- there are even massive logic gaps in continuity (in one scene the entire US government knows about the existence of Xavier and his mutants and towards the ending it seems only one CIA agent is aware of it and in another scene a secret agent spies on a mutant telepath in the other room and the mutant is completely unaware of it even though she's suppose to be able to read minds). With the exception of Xavier, Magneto, Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) and Beast (Nicholas Hoult) all the other characters in the movie are nothing more than plot pieces and exist solely as gimmicks. This points out to another weakness in the franchise: too many mutant characters and not enough script to develop their personalities so this means you hardly notice or care about them if they die.<br/><br/>Sure, the 60's retro look set pieces are nice and the special effects are up to par but the rest of it just isn't there."

","'X-MEN: FIRST CLASS': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>Prequel to the other four 'X-MEN' films detailing the origins of the first 'X-Men' team (in 1962) and focusing primarily on the friendship, that later turned to rivalry, between Charles Xavier and Erik Lehnsherr (who later became known as Professor X and Magneto).  The film was directed and co-written by Matthew Vaughn (also well known for adapting another popular comic book to film, 'KICK-ASS').  The script was also worked on by five other writers including Bryan Singer (the filmmaker behind the first two, much more loved, 'X-MEN' films), who was also set to direct this film before taking a producing seat instead in order to helm another project.  The movie stars James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence, Kevin Bacon, Rose Byrne, January Jones and Nicholas Hoult.  It's not quite as good as the first two installments but it is far superior to the last two.  Despite a somewhat rocky start it's an extremely satisfying and entertaining thrill ride that is sure to please most die-hard fans of the comics and movie series.<br/><br/>The film opens with a scene from the first 'X-MEN' movie in which Erik is a child in a German concentration camp in 1944 and bends a metal gate, using his mutant ability to control metals, in an attempt to free his parents.  A scientist named Sebastian Shaw (Bacon) witnesses this and while trying to provoke the boy's power murders his mother.  Several years later Erik (Fassbender) is now obsessed with revenge.  While trying to murder Shaw he teams up with Xavier (McAvoy), the worlds most powerful telepath, who teaches him to harness his inner rage and better control his powers.  The two lead a team of young gifted mutants such as themselves in conjunction with the CIA.  Their ideas on what's best for their kind of course clashes and eventually challenges their friendship.<br/><br/>The film is not as fun as the other installments, it's slower paced and extremely moody, but it is more serious and in many ways more faithful to it's source material. There are several inconsistency flaws with the other film chapters (if you thought the 'STAR WARS' prequels were bad, they're nothing compared to this) which is why many fans thought the filmmakers should have done a completely new reboot rather than a prequel. The inconsistencies don't really effect the overall quality of the film though. Once again they tried to pack too many characters and too many major events into one film and it's far too convoluted at times, early on, but it does pick up and get better as the film goes along.  The major characters are well thought out and relatable. The film, as with the entire series, grapples with the difficult society challenges faced with being an individual and different than the norm. This is where the movie is the strongest in many ways (as with the early two films), battling discrimination is a very emotional and serious topic for many and this chapter once again does an admirable job relating the issue. The action is of course stellar as well and Vaughn is once again in top form behind the camera. The performances are impressive all around once again as well, especially Fassbender, who's a star to watch out for. I'm becoming a big fan of Lawrence and she's good in this movie but it's hardly comparable to her Oscar nominated work from last year (in 'WINTER'S BONE'). Still it's nice to see her giving any of her talents to a comic book fanboy film like this. There's some nice surprise cameos as well. The film is pretty much grade A material all around. The hardcore nerds of course will never be pleased with anything that isn't the page reincarnated panel by panel on the big screen but most fans should be thrilled.<br/><br/>Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1S3pjephF8"

","Well let's be completely honest Hollywood had lost their control over the X-men film-saga when ""the last stand"" came out. The bigger is better principle isn't always the right way to go. And it's a shame they need reboots to deal with the issues created by shitty films. <br/><br/>It's even worse when the reboot fail. But this is NOT the case with ""X-men: first class"". I was afraid I had seen a bit too much promo clips and so on. But even this was not the case. I can gladly say the promo's don't give away too much. <br/><br/>The story doesn't really climax in the movie. When Michael Fassbender's Magneto is faced with Kevin Bacon's character, it builds up to a lot more expectations than what is delivered on screen but this being said the film introduces new characters which is more than welcome. And again in comparison to ""Last stand"" they introduce them more properly. It's not here is character Y, and this is his death, we needed somebody to kill. <br/><br/>After seeing this I'm hoping Marvel will continue making movies but I'm also very much so actually hoping they do this with eye for detail, respect to the intricate story lines and quality of the film! <br/><br/>In ""First Class"" they prove they haven't lost the battle with ""X-men""!"

Hello! You have super powers, did you ever think of fighting back? Shaw makes some hideous speech to convert them to other side and when only the fairy girl joins, he leaves the rest of them behind (to fight him later of course) oh except for making the adapter dude spontaneously combust without the effects of the explosion (like death) affecting the others. See how dumb this all sounds? Well its like this for 2 hours and a bit. <br/><br/>Mystique is kept in the background most of the time and her character is regularly seen making stupid comments and stupid decisions.

","Another fantastic 2011 summer release! The thing i like with this and the Transformers franchise is they only keep getting better and better! This instalment being a prequel tells a lot of the origins of Magneto (Michael Fassbender) and Xavier (James McAvoy) and how the good and bad alliances were formed. Another great one for fans of Cgi (As i am ) The story turns back the clocks to 1960's during the time of the missile crisis between the US and Russia! As World War 3 seems eminent, both Magneto and Professor X work together as a villain Sebastian Shaw (played brilliantly by Kevin Bacon) plans on using his powers to use WW3 to eliminate the human race altogether making earth a planet for mutants only. A great prequel which in my mind could be used also as a vessel for more prequels if Matthew Vaughn hopefully wants to. To me this is the best comic book super hero franchise presently going and i hope to keep seeing more!"
"Dory_Darko","10","3","7","3 July 2011"," X-ellent in every way.
","Here on IMDb, X-Men: First Class has garnered the highest rating of all films in the X-Men franchise so far. Given the fact that this film features only a few of the familiar characters of the previous films, portrayed by different, younger actors, and the complete absence of Wolverine, the (current) rating of 8.1 somewhat surprised me. That was before I had seen it...<br/><br/>Being a pretty big X-Men fan myself, I was excited to see this, regardless of plot or characters. However, I was also a little wary of what to expect, for the reasons stated above. I suspect that anybody reading this might feel the same way. But rest assured, any doubts were quickly dispelled no later than the opening scene. First Class starts off very well, with the exact same opening scene as the first X-Men, featuring a young Erik Lehnsherr being separated from his parents in a Nazi concentration camp. What follows after this familiar story is something completely new and particularly dark and brutal. I won't give away any important plot lines, but suffice it to say there won't be a single person left wondering why Magneto is so resentful of ""normal"" people. This event also sets the tone for the rest of the film, and, to a great extent, explains why First Class is such a success: this film is all about character. Whereas all the other films were mostly about cool superheroes and special effects, First Class is all about character development and the history of those who would later become Professor X and Magneto. This concept might have failed big time if it wasn't for the superb screenplay. I take my hat off to whoever managed to incorporate every little, but crucial, character and storyline and made it flow together so beautifully. Literally everything comes together in this film, everything you might have wondered (why is Xavier paralyzed?) is given a credible and fitting explanation. <br/><br/>Another real strength of FC is its cast. Everybody in this film is right where they should be. Kevin Bacon is the perfect villain (but we already knew that), James McAvoy not only looks, but sounds and moves like the young Charles Xavier would. Jennifer Lawrence is a convincing, young (and believe it or not, insecure) Mystique. All other characters are perfectly cast as well, humans and mutants alike. However, I feel that most credit is due to Michael Fassbender, an actor I am now ashamed to say I had never even heard of before. The way he portrays the 30-something Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto is stunning. His entire physique, down to every little twitch in his face, truly captivates all the pain and agony Erik has had to endure throughout his life. It makes you sympathize with Magneto and understand why he is the way he is. Whereas the ""old"" Magneto was little more than a bitter old man who despised Homo sapiens for undisclosed reasons (with no discredit to Ian McKellen intended here), Michael Fassbender does something I thought was almost impossible in a superhero flick: he gives Magneto a soul.<br/><br/>In case I might have given the impression that X-Men: First Class is no more than some wishy-washy character drama, don't worry. There are plenty of awesome action sequences and special effects to keep the more adrenaline-pumped movie-goer satisfied. And before I forget: there are two small, but awesome cameo appearances which I know you will enjoy <br/><br/>Finally, a small note on parental guidance: I was absolutely baffled to see that half of the audience consisted of parents with small children. Like I said before, this is not just another cool superhero movie. X-Men: First Class features elements which are quite dark and graphic, and especially the scenes portraying Nazi brutality are not intended for a young audience. Personally, I would say 14 is the appropriate minimum age. <br/><br/>With all that said, I would recommend this film to anyone, even to those of you who aren't X-Men fans. It doesn't happen very often that I can't find a single flaw in a film, but I guess this is just one of those rare cases. Great directing, great acting, great everything. Period."

The scenery in this film is stunning as well.

"jimmy2","9","3","7","15 June 2011"," X-cellent prequel
","Ladies and gentlemen, I present one of the best films you'll see all year. 'First Class' is, indeed, first class, and returns the X-Men name back to cinematic glory.<br/><br/>One of the key ingredients for this movie's success is the emotional resonance that the audience gleans from the characters. The screenwriters, producers, and director seem to fully connect with the X-Men mythos, and while this movie is not 100% true to the events in the comics, the emotional resonance is intact, and that's really what matters most.<br/><br/>Another key ingredient is the cast, which is practically devoid of A-list actors. These actors put their best foot forward, even at the risk of being typecast, which in my view, is very honourably. It goes to show how much respect the material is garnered.<br/><br/>As an example, Michael Fassbender has to be the most intense actor in recent memory. His performance in Inglourious Basterds only hints at the intensity that he displays in this film. His Erik is at times sympathetic, other times morally reprehensible, but we as an audience fully understand the reasons behind his actions, almost like we can put ourselves in his shoes if we experienced the same trauma he experienced. This creates as close to an Oscar-worthy performance as one can possibly hope to achieve. To not get a nomination would be a crime.<br/><br/>James McAvoy's excellent performance as the future Professor Xavier is the other side of the coin to Erik's intensity; he initially represents conformity to the homo sapien ideal rather than homo superior. He uses his gift as more of a means to pick up women rather than more noble and heroic pursuits. It's not until Moira McTaggert enters his life that he acts on those pursuits, even if he's initially compelled by the CIA to do so.<br/><br/>Xavier's initial meeting with Mr. Lehnsherr is a life-changing moment; he went from being pacifist to activist after knowing first-hand what Erik went through during the Holocaust. This, in turn, leads to an understanding between the two that develops into a deep friendship that will be tested later in the film.<br/><br/>The accompanying cast holds their own; Jennifer Lawrence as Raven makes a complete character metamorphesis from someone who's eager to please in order to conform, to someone who's fully comfortable with who she is. Conformity vs free-will is a component that is examined time and again throughout the film at pivotal moments to great effect.<br/><br/>I haven't even touched on the time period when the movie takes place, which has about as much to do with the plot as everything else. Another well thought-out component.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this film if you are into the X-Men, or just into really good movies. You will *not* be disappointed."

The SFX were superb .The settings, the house, everything was superb.<br/><br/>It does an excellent job in setting the scene for the future films with incidents and one liners.<br/><br/>Fassbender is visually an excellent choice for the future Magneto.

","An x-men movie without Scott(cyclops) and Jean Grey?, man , its gonna be boring !!!, that was my initial reaction, but this movie definitely takes the x-men series to an altogether new high.<br/><br/>Story : In short , the story revolves around the origin of the initial x-men characters, professor x, magneto, and mystique. also joined by a few others as well, in the Cuban missile crisis backdrop. the story is very well written , and actually has a lot more depth to it than the other x-men films.<br/><br/>Characters & Acting : It was amazing to see the characters of Magneto and Professor x, with powers toned to close perfection to fit into a brilliant movie, the balance created was the key to the movie, a special mention to James Mc Avoy , he had nailed the character completely, in fact the performances were equally strong throughout the movie but rather a little weak when the younger breed steps in, but thats cos they dint have enough of screen time and development time.<br/><br/>Special Effects : The films C.g.i was at the best above average, it almost looks pre-production level near the climax sequences, but apart from that, the , they work, they work because of the background score complementing it so beautifully, some very beautifully choreographed sequences to look out for here !!.<br/><br/>Sound track : the sound track by Henry Jackson was simply put ""Awesome"". It adds a whole new level of involvement and intensity to the movie, very interesting cues and strong sounds, though a drawback could be that the viewer gets a little fatigued around the middle. else we can say it adds brilliantly !!<br/><br/>Directing : Admittedly, i loved kick ass, but X-men is a wholly different kind of a story, but, Vaughn , pulled it off with utmost style.<br/><br/>Conclusion : There really isn't anything to point out in this movie, and it is rare to see a movie getting so many things right , just go and watch it !!<br/><br/>p.s : i would be extremely cool to see what Mathew Vaughn would do once all the characters step in !!"
"3xHCCH","9","3","7","9 June 2011"," An Excellent Must-Watch Prequel to the X-Men Saga
","Another Marvel X-Men film, another excellent summer blockbuster! Of all the characters in the Marvel universe, I find the X-Men to be the most interesting of all. This story which explores the beginnings of not just one, but the two most powerful senior X-Men can certainly do no wrong. <br/><br/>At first, I was worried about this film being a teenage movie with a lot of teenage angst going on. Wrong. This film is a very mature treatment of the close friendship that developed between the brainy privileged Charles Xavier and the troubled angry Erik Lensherr, and how they forged the beginning of the mutant organization on Earth. We are brought into the Cold War and the Cuban missile crisis as the historical backdrop of this story. The main antagonist is the mad and greedy Dr. Sebastian Shaw who also has his own army of mutants. <br/><br/>The acting of the cast was also faultless, led by James McAvoy (as Charles) and Michael Fassbender (as Erik). As can be predicted, the turn of Erik to the Dark Side was the more intense character arc, but the Charles angle was not left weak. There was a touching subplot featuring Raven (Mystique) and Hank (Beast) about mutant appearances, which actors Jennifer Lawrence and Nicholas Hoult also portrayed very well. Veteran Kevin Bacon does his slimy best as maniacal Dr. Shaw, with the help of the sexy January Jones as the icy Emma Frost.<br/><br/>This type of movie, being a prequel, is the type where the beginning and middle are more interesting than the end, which we already know what happens beforehand. I loved how they tied everything up very neatly in the details about each character we all know very well. Director Matthew Vaughn navigates the main story and its subplots into one coherent, entertaining and exciting whole. Bryan Singer, director of the first two (and best two) X-Men movies, is also on board here as one of the writing team. Awesome special effects complete this overall excellent package. A must watch, most certainly!"

","I just saw the movie and throughout the movie there wasn't a moment where i thought this should have been avoided or something's missing. The performances from Michael Fassbender as Magneto and James McAvoy as Prof. X were outstanding. The always inspiring, loving, motivating and a born leader character of Prof. X was portrayed beautifully by Jason and the ever witty, evil, brawny and hothead Magneto was simply superb. The relation between them was portrayed splendidly. Each and every character responded beautifully to the awe inspiring direction and beautifully written script. A true pre-prequel(pre pre coz i consider wolverine as a true prequel) to the trilogy. Even surprising cameo by Wolverine was soothing and added savor to the script. The sound effect, animation and cinematography was outstanding. The plot was laid firmly and the story evolves beautifully keeping in mind about the trilogy. The most surprising thing was the relationship of Prof. X and Mystique. The trilogy haven't had shed light on that but in this movie it was portrayed beautifully. Each and everything was perfect.<br/><br/>I would recommend this as a must for every fan of the series and believe you won't be disappointed.<br/><br/>My score is 9.2/10. (.8 for the action sequence which could have been made a little better)"
"ththaymes378","9","3","7","6 June 2011"," Everything the first four films should've been, and everything a summer film should be!
","Okay, yes, looking back there are some continuity issues that are only further confounded by character appearances in films three and four. And Hugh Jackman's cameo may only work to further drive this point. But watching the film, I never once thought of these issues, because i was focused on the film in itself. I'd call it an alternate universe (Remember people, this is a COMIC BOOK movie! Such a thing is NOT unheard of!) even with the same Wolverine from the original films. Moving on from there, this film is simply perfect as a summer tent-pole. It has a balance between the scope of an epic and the closeness of a personal story, even with all its characters. Its action is exhilarating and even the non-action sequences are capable of drawing you in. The acting, writing, and direction have the right mix of humor, seriousness, and emotion. The world created here is a wonderful blend of James Bond and Marvel - though the latter's traditional prejudice is downplayed a bit. But it is X-Men nonetheless. Lastly, unlike all the other films, it is actually an endearing story - one that you can invest yourself in and is more than an attempt to make money. I would recommend this to everyone I know."
"Carycomic","5","3","7","4 June 2011"," It completely contradicts the last two movies.
","Which is the only reason I don't give this a perfect ten. MacAvoy and Fassbender are superb as early day versions of Charles Xavier and Erik Magnus Lensherr. And, even the transposition of Darwin and Tempest from their early 21st century comic book appearances, to the Cuban Missile Crisis, I can deal with.<br/><br/>But, what I cannot abide is needless rebooting with no regard for the memory of the older movie-goers, or credit for their intelligence.<br/><br/>Emma Frost was ten years younger in X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE (which was set mostly in the 1970's) than January Jones' portrayal, here. Of course, fan boys like me can easily ret-con that by saying: ""Oh! Maybe the one in ORIGINS is this one's namesake niece. Maybe even her daughter! After all, Silver Fox did call her 'my sister.' Which could imply some kind of adoptive sibling relationship.""<br/><br/>But, not so easy to ignore is the fact that this prequel depicts Xavier being accidentally crippled by Moira McTaggart. Whereas, in the flashback prologue of X-MEN: THE LAST STAND (set circa the 1980's), he was seen as perfectly ambulatory. _Walking_ into the Grey family's residence, to meet adolescent Jean, side-by-side with Lensherr! <br/><br/>How are you going to explain that one away, Fox and Marvel? A bitter, time-traveling Romulan from the 24th Century? I don't think so.<br/><br/>In short; the movie wasn't bad. But, in this case? ""Not bad"" is just not good enough."
"honorhorror","8","3","7","3 June 2011"," A great production with some rough corners.
","Before I went into cinema for X-Men:First Class, a few media reviews really had cranked up my expectations. So, let's be honest, and say that this movie was so close to meet my expectations. <br/><br/>The filmmakers did a fantastic job knitting up everything in the first act, made it very character-driven. Nothing in the first 40 minutes makes you feel half-cooked because neither Charles' nerd personality nor Eric's washed-up revenger aura ever feels old. The whole movie basically feeds you with a great sense of retrospective spy movie. The same approach was at its peak in another superhero marvel--The Incredibles. It works fantastic if you factor in the fact that X-men:First Class is not a cartoon. There are action sequences set throughout the movie deliberately minimizing the use of CGI, which added significant believability to the film. <br/><br/>The 2nd act, which to my surprise, didn't really slow down for character-building. The movie is fantastic in bringing actions and characters to a balance, which worked just like the first two X-men films. <br/><br/>I was ready to be bombarded by the massive amount of CGI in the climax of the film, which if not for the restraining, smart usage of special effects during the first half, would not be so obviously artificial. That issue, along with my hectic expectations for the drama between Charles and Eric did make the climax of the film a bit, uh, unsatisfying. I was really thinking about if they can wrap up everything until Charles said half-mockingly, ""I'd soon be bald.""<br/><br/>The new Mystique, played by beautiful Jennifer Lawrence, was at the heart of the whole drama side of this action film. Mystique's character building was maybe the best compared to the main guys, Charles and Eric. Mystique's struggles of identity crisis, despite its cartooned roots in X-Men universe, is heartfelt. It's especially true to those living in a multi-ethnic environment. Mystique was so outstanding that both Charles and Eric had left something to be desired, in my opinion. Charles and Eric on the other hand, felt like they were already in their full-blown form. It's kind of hard not to factor in my own interpretations and assumptions when I tried to appreciate their development. <br/><br/>At last, the movie is complemented with a great score. 8/10. Way to go, X-Men. If you like to hear about my interpretation about Charles, please feel free to read on.<br/><br/>So, here's my interpretation about Charles's development in First Class. Charles was born in the upper class of his world, which formed his view of the world and mindset in a mainstream way. His mind-reading abilities allowed him to walk in the rains of social life without getting wet, which formed his illusion of being the mighty leader/father figure of mutants. If not for Magneto, he'd probably never feel the pain of belittled, incompetent, and incomplete. His disability to walk, along with the loss of his sister, aka Mystique, humbled him and sent him on the way to be closer to the a father figure/authentic peacemaker. Alas for Charles, no matter how many times he had read Mystique's mind, there were actually more delicate matters than he could fathom that was going on in her. Don't we, the self-respected intellectuals often do the same with our families? We sometimes feel like what's truly important is only arm's length away, yet in our frustration we turn to pervert or twist it.

The movie gives a great background of how the X-men came to form what we all know them for. The movie can be seen as a prequel for the previous movies and it really makes you understand everything about X-men that you may be wondering about. If you were a fan of the previous X-men movies, then you forget about those after seeing this. i honestly cant say enough about this movie.

"tha_mongoose","8","3","7","1 June 2011"," Vaughn's got the formula
","I'll preface this by being completely blunt. After watching the last X- Men, Rattner's bastard child, I was skeptic about another potential waste of my time.<br/><br/>However, what made X-Men: The Last Stand mediocre made First Class splendid. First we have the cast. Halle Berry and Hugh Jackman are both questionable actors. Add Famke Jansen and Ana Paquin and you're heading for disaster. Which is what The Last Stand was. Even Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart couldn't save it, surrounded as they were.<br/><br/>Fast forward to First Class and the quality already begins with the choice of director. It was inevitable that the man that brought us Layer Cake (and then showed his hand in the super-hero milieu with Kick-Ass) could somehow pull a decent X-Men movie off. No easy feat considering our expectations after what we'd seen before.<br/><br/>The fresh set of actors selected for First Class was its crowning achievement. Fassbender and McAvoy are sublime together. Bacon's chemistry with Magneto is dynamite. Another phenomenon was present: even seemingly redundant (in their secondariness) roles were played by solid actors (such as the American and Russian ship commanders, and their politician counterparts). <br/><br/>January Jones' good looks were put to their proper use, even if there was no palpable difference between her character Emma Frost and Cadence Flaherty, and Byrne showed heretofore unseen ability, if a little tame in comparison with the others present. Nicholas Hoult, after playing such a different person in Skins, was a pleasant surprise.<br/><br/>First Class is another of Vaughn's marvelous brand of superhero movies. What we'd already seen in Kick-Ass we see here: the acting is so believable, and the story so carefully and craftily woven, that the end- result is more than just popcorn entertainment.<br/><br/>You can usually tell how good a movie is when its length imposes no boundaries on your viewing of it. Well, First Class's 2 hours passed by in 5 minutes. There wasn't a single frame too many of cheese, the strings played in the right moments, and it seamlessly integrated first- rate action with an engaging plot.<br/><br/>This is what movie-making is all about. Other directors should learn from Mr. Vaughn. He is an exquisite picture-maker. Hats off to you sir! 8/10."

","Just came back from an advance screening ! Personal best movie of the year so far, there is no way on earth transformer can match it,however, on the dark side of the moon maybe.<br/><br/>Overall the movie is fairly fast paced, kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. I am usually quite good at sensing the direction of the plot, if the ending is obvious as a result of good vs evil, then I consider myself good at sensing how. But this one didn't even give me a long enough of a break to think of how ...and the ending is mildly surprising and also makes a lot of sense and ties well with the previous 4 movies.<br/><br/>Story wise it is also really good, especially for a superhero/Sci-Fi/action movie, the script packs quite a punch, and the depth is deeper than your average super sized pop corn bag offered at your local theater! <br/><br/>Don't wanna give out too much detail so someone might get too hyped and lose the pleasantly surprised fact except: This movie is really a nice balance of Sci-Fi, fantasy, action, drama, super hero-comic adaptation, a little short side on the romance(not a bad thing in my opinion ,you want romance in this?seriously ?), comedy...<br/><br/>Really, a group of talented people who promote balance that can actually understand it !

","This movie, would be great for someone who knows absolutely nothing about the X-Men and their abilities. They spend the better half of the movie explaining who people are, and what their abilities are. If you already know this stuff however, the movie does drag quite a bit.<br/><br/>The movie is funny at parts, and well thought out, but it could of done with limiting all the back story given. I didn't need to watch a half hour montage of a training lesson for each of the hero, when they could of trained in more real life situations. Beast is in the movie, so it's not like they couldn't of made a mock-up of the training equipment they have in the school Xavier eventually gets.<br/><br/>I suggest waiting on this one.

","I read about all the major Marvel and DC characters in the comics when I was younger. At the time, the X-Men were probably the best written on a consistent basis. But I don't think they were ever as well written as I felt they were in this movie. And I don't think I ever cared about the characters as much as I did watching First Class. The relationships between Charles and the two main villains, Magneto and Mystique, are so poignant. I think I responded to this movie more on an emotional level than any other comic book movie. The Avengers might be more fun, and Winter Soldier might be more expertly crafted, but this one has the most effective melodrama. It's almost a tearjerker, although not in an overly sentimental way. The fact that Charles Xavier taught Magneto to believe in himself, but then they still turned against each other--almost coming to blows, but still caring about each other-- well, that was the major achievement, more so than any special effects."

"manendra-lodhi","8","2","4","29 October 2012"," ""Best of all x-men films.""
","Why I have considered this one as the best of all the X-men films, is that the story was the best among all. Other films were concentrated on the conflicts between, the two gangs but this one developed emotions and friendship properly. The franchise has rebooted the series with a prequel. The story is about the early lives of Professor X and Magneto. I must say that Michael fassbender as magneto has looked very authentic. In fact the entire cast has done a wonderful job as far as the acting is considered. The feeling to see magneto and professor X working together was awesome. They would have made an awesome team. The differences were genuine and to me both looked right in their own places. It is full of action.<br/><br/>PROS: <br/><br/>Raising some thought provoking questions; the film is a piece to watch at least once. If the human race is going to meet some of these mutants in reality than obviously, normal people would fear from them. They have powers with which they are lifting submarines from the sea. How could humans feel safe living with them? This is an important question because humans cannot consider them equal to them and live peacefully. It is imperative that man is an animal in all ways and these mutated people will someday lose sanity and start doing weird things. There is no way of convincing humans that we will be safe forever. On the other sides if we see it from the point of mutants, they are also not wrong in thinking that humans will try to destroy them someday. Professor X plays the role of a saint in this. But it is nearly impossible for him to control everything. I am with Humans on the subject.<br/><br/>The visuals are satisfactory and the film is not crowded with them unnecessarily. The story is the backbone of the film. You'll eventually want for more. The cinematography is good especially in the end and all fights. The new characters had proper time based on their capabilities. The film has done true justice to its purpose of introducing the two major characters of the franchise.<br/><br/>CONS: <br/><br/>The film in the second half seemed to rush a lot. The training and everything was going so fast that it looked to be a race to complete the film. 20 more minutes wouldn't have been a bad idea.<br/><br/>MESSAGE: ""Everyone needs friends."" <br/><br/>VERDICT: ""A recommended watch."""

","All these very positive reviews on here must be from people whom didn't see the first X-Men movie because this one pales in comparison. I really liked the first one, but this one was just not that good. The actors and characters are not as good and the story line is much slower.<br/><br/>The main plot is how Magneto and Xavier were friends at first and worked together but then parted ways as Magento saw their mutations as a way to dominate humans. They find other mutants in the most boring musical montage. The only redeeming character is the baddie played by Kevin Bacon. He was a great bad guy.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: After seeing it, I say skip it."
"Enchorde","7","2","4","3 November 2011"," A surprisingly good prequel
","X-men: First Class is a very good and entertaining action movie, much better than other spin-offs from the X-men saga. In my mind, it might be the best since the original X-men, even though I missed a few of the characters from the sequels.<br/><br/>But being a prequel, which is always tricky, First Class does it very well. I'm actually impressed how the story was written as to be both fun and not overly evident, but at the same time keeping the integrity of the ""following"" movie.<br/><br/>Of course there are lots and lots of special effects, most of which are done very well. It fits the story, and never feels out of place. Maybe not too hard to accomplish since a story like this needs a lot of special effects.<br/><br/>I liked many of the ""new"" characters as well. Not being familiar to the comic X-men world I can't say if they're true to the comic, but they felt right in the movie. Not sure if they can return in an eventual sequel since they do not appear in the ""original"". They have also found a good cast to the characters, McAvoy does it good as a young Xavier, but can't unfortunately not really compare to Patrick Stewart. Then Fassbender is better as Magneto. Lucas Till and January Jones fits their characters nicely, but perhaps best is Kevin Bacon as the villain Shaw. Bacon is underrated and it is nice to see him in a leading role.<br/><br/>In all this is an entertaining movie, mostly because of good action. It is not as good in the humor and one-liners as the original, mostly delivered there by Wolverine, whom does have a cameo though. It is a very good prequel though, and I would be interested to see if and when they continue the saga.<br/><br/>7/10"
"Ryan_MYeah","8","2","4","24 October 2011"," A slick origin story. Stylish and gripping.
","I guess the way to start this review is to tell you what I thought of the other films. I thought the first two films were great. Then came the dreaded downgrade in quality that was The Last Stand. I thought the Wolverine film was enjoyable, but flawed overall. This new entry is now a pleasant return to form.<br/><br/>Rebooting the time line of the series to the days of the Cold War, the film follows the early days of the founding X-Men, Charles Xavier (Played by James McAvoy), a highly intelligent telepath, and Erik Lensherr (Played by Michael Fassbender), a man with the powerful ability to control metal. Once they meet, they form a team of others like them, those with extraordinary abilities (otherwise known as mutants). But danger starts to arise when an enemy team of mutants, led by the powerful Sebastian Shaw (Played by Kevin Bacon), begins to initiate a chain of events that would begin World War 3 unless the X-Men can stop them.<br/><br/>First Class not only excels as an action movie, but also manages to feel fleshed out, and three dimensional, instead of feeling like a monotonous back to back action set piece. Director Matthew Vaughn and the film's powerful cast give the film an unusual heart, specifically between the complicated friendship between Xavier and Lensherr (McAvoy and Fassbender are a perfectly matched duo). But let's not forget the film's attention to other themes, such as prejudice and conformity. The narrative is not always perfect, and Fassbender has brief habits of slipping in and out of accent, but everything manages to be solid.<br/><br/>As far as action goes, this a fun ride to sit through. Each action sequence is impeccably paced by Lee Smith (The marvelous editor of Inception), including the film's epic and enrapturing third act. There's also a stylistic attention to visual detail, whether it be the elegant production design, the well done visual effects, and fantastic makeup and sound design. Oh, and I also got a kick out of a brief cameo by Hugh Jackman.<br/><br/>First Class is the best of the comic book summer, and I give it *** out of ****"
"PittsburghFilmCritic","Null","2","4","17 October 2011"," A First Class Movie
","Despite the success of the original X-Men movie trilogy (2000-2006), based on the failure of X-Men Origins: Wolverine, the new X-Men movie, X-Men: First Class, which arrived in theaters Friday, had most comic book-turned-movie fans uneasy. Furthermore, the mediocrity of the first Fantastic Four movie, Thor, and Superman Returns, make the creation of a successful superhero coming-of-age/beginnings film seem impossible.<br/><br/>However, the 132 minute X-Men: First Class proves that super hero movies are far from finished. Boasting spectacular acting performances by James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender and Jennifer Lawrence, an incredible script, and stunning visuals, this movie is one of the first must-see movies of the 2011 summer.<br/><br/>X-Men: First Class also manages to succeed where the other aforementioned comic book movies failed – it is action-packed and thrilling. The movie is reminiscent of the sensational 2008 superhero movie, The Dark Knight in its fast-paced yet digestible storyline – X- Men: First Class brilliantly traces each characters physical, emotional, and mental development in the movie, while simultaneously showing the viewer each characters motivation, past, and, to an extent, future. These moments of development play pivotal roles in the film, but they are integrated into the main action of the plot, so the movie doesn't have the now common feelings of slowness and transition associated with character development.<br/><br/>Moreover, the movie is strong enough to stand alone – meaning that the viewer doesn't need to have seen the previous X-Men movies to understand and enjoy this one. However, the director, Matthew Vaughn, makes sure to drop plenty of subtle jokes (including a brilliant cameo from one of the actors in the earlier movies) to keep the more intimate fans satisfied. The movie doesn't stay as true to the comic books as many of the more obsessed fans would like to see, and to that, I simply say, stop going to the movies to watch books. If you want to see something that closely follows the original plot line, curl up at home, alone, in bed, with your snuggie and apple juice, and read your precious comic books."

","This fifth installment of the X Men series is by far the best of the bunch. Building on the saga that director Bryan Singer started, this is made on a much bigger budget of $160M compared to that of $70M for the first X Men movie.<br/><br/>The story picks up where the first X Men saga started, in the Polish concentration camp run by the Nazis where young Magnito (Bill Milner) started to show his unusual power. A mutant version of Dr. Mengele, Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) wants to pick on young Magnito's talent, and in the process murders his mother. Some years later in the early '60s, Eric/Magnito (Michael Fassbender), now a grown young man, wants his revenge on Shaw, and is on his trail. In the mean time, young Charles Xavier (Laurence Belcher), finds kindred spirit with also very young Mystique (Morgan Lily). They grow up together in Xavier's home all the way up 'till Xavier graduates from Oxford with a doctorate degree. They team up with mutant genius Hank McCoy/Beast (Nicholas Hoult) who invents Celebro to locate other mutants. Soon the first batch of X Men is formed (Not the same crew the first X Men were in the comic book series) which includes Magnito, and Banshee who will later become their enemies. By this time, CIA has been introduced to the existence of the mutants, and starts to show their interest. One of the interested party is colonel Stryker. Magnito, still out for his revenge, involves Xavier and other X Men on the battle against Shaw.<br/><br/>This is the most polished in terms of production out of all X Men movie series. The screen writers did an excellent job of integrating the origins of X Men saga without hiring back the original actors of the series. Although it's a prequel to the first X Men movie, the movie has freshness that makes it stand alone as an original chapter in the X Men's saga. While other producers continue to trash the Marvel franchise, this series is amazingly consistent in their quality with producer Bryan Singer, and other talented writers, and directors holding the quality together. <br/><br/>I loved the plot, and the character development of each of the X Men the way it was shown on this movie. It's an original story, but one that I'm sure will make Stan Lee, and Jack Kirby proud.<br/><br/>There were some period piece screw ups in the props like seeing Revox A77 recorder which is a product of the early '70s, and Bose 901 series III speakers which are the product of the early '80s. Fashion, and the buildings were of much more modern vintage than the early '60s when this story is supposed to be taking place. But overall, they didn't mess up the mood of the story too badly.<br/><br/>This was a first class production, and even if it wasn't a spectacular hit at the box office, merits a sequel done by the same team of creators."
"agmoldham","5","2","4","30 September 2011"," One of the better ""blockbusters""
","I didn't enter the movie with high expectations, but must confess to enjoying the latest prequel more than many of it's counterparts.<br/><br/>The film starts with one of the scenes from the original movie and then flashes backwards and forwards with the majority of the film based in 1962.<br/><br/>Here we find Xavier and Magneto becoming aware of their powers and finding others with special powers. The film is very well scripted and in common with the better films in the X series you really feel empathy or at least understanding with most of the leading characters. As with other prequels you always have a very good idea about what the ultimate conclusion will be but it's a great ride getting there and thoroughly enjoyable."
"kaycee-martin92","9","2","4","23 September 2011"," The best film in the series thus far
","Despite being a long time fan of the X-men movie franchise when this movie was released I wasn't exactly desperate to see it. I'm going to put it down to a lack of promotion. I was hardly aware of the movie even existing when I made the last minute decision to see it at the cinema. <br/><br/>I rate this film a 9/10, based on my personal enjoyment. I loved the character development (minus that of Angel Salvadore), enjoyed the SFX and the storyline. I particularly liked seeing a young Mystique and watching the way she develops into who she will be in the future. I also thoroughly enjoyed seeing the basis of both Banshee and Beast. I didn't believe January Jones wrecked the film as much as others have made her out to have; she definitely wasn't a highlight, but I didn't find it ruined the film either (if you ask me, people are just being picky). I loved the casting of the film and the action scenes. The story kept me engaged.<br/><br/>The one thing I find annoying is the way the films do not ever match up. For example: Emma Frost as a teenager in 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine' is saved from ""The Island"" and taken in by Professor X to his school, while in this movie she is a grown and established mutant fighting against Professor X in his youth prior to a school ever being established. None of the films are ever consistent with each other which can be mildly annoying; but I choose to judge a film on its own rather in comparison to other movies. I would enjoy it more if they all added up and molded together.<br/><br/>An overall enjoyable and well executed film for the X-men series. It is thus far my favourite."
"mschal5","2","2","4","23 September 2011"," Perfect for the uninformed reader
","This movie is perfect for those moviegoers who have an interest in the series without actually knowing anything about the true origins of this series. <br/><br/>For those who have actually read the original comics, myself included, this movie is a travesty in every sense of the word. This movie butchered the original storyline, and constantly added and removed characters just for the sake of adding a little variety to the type of mutants that have been shown in the other movies. In reality, by which I mean the reality of the Marvel Universe, the only correct person on the team was Beast and the writers found a way to screw that up as well. Beast did not undergo his transformation until he sustained massive amounts of injury; he was not given a choice about the serum, if he didn't take it he would have died. Moira MacTaggert did not work for the CIA, but was a Scottish scientist; Mystique was not alive at this time; Emma Frost was not alive at this time. One of the most blatant errors is the fact that Alex Summers is in this movie, while his brother Scott (Cyclops) is not even mentioned and he was part of the actual first class of mutants. The only thing the writers got right was the period of time in which the first class existed. Screen writers need to stop trying to alter an already good story; the story is already laid out for you in the comics, all they need to do is expand on it a little. That is the good thing about the comics, they do have a large enough storyline one just needs to read enough issues. <br/><br/>As I stated at the beginning of the review, this movie is perfect for those who base all their knowledge of the universe from the other movies. They are content with seeing new, shiny mutants mixed in with a few favorites and a cameo or two. However, the writers should tailor the storyline for the actual fans who might be more interested in seeing a movie in theaters if the universe isn't butchered, like the way it is here. I guess this movie is no different than any other based from some form of literature; the general masses are content with shiny colors and loud noises, while those with knowledge are doomed to lament for the desecration of a piece of art."
"jonno-ice","8","2","4","19 June 2011"," Turning a leaden franchise into box office gold
","X-men First Class is a film that just feels good.<br/><br/>It is by no means a perfect film, but the keys to its success are its good bits burning up the bad bits. In other words, I did not walk out of the theater remembering the unpleasant pieces of the film.<br/><br/>X-men First Class's plot line is given in the title, and the details are the origin of two types of mutant, those who are good and those who are bad. The set pieces of the film are based around the Cuban Missile crisis, and who can save the human race from its destruction, or create its destruction <br/><br/>Sound familiar?<br/><br/>Well, that's because it is, but the key aspect of the film is not this plot line, but the execution of this well worn storyline. <br/><br/>The ambiguity of the characters is vividly portrayed, and I believe it is at least one of the elements of the film that makes it so engrossing. For example, the character of Erik Lensherr, given as the super villain of the series, is hard to nail down as a simple villain. For every (supposedly?) evil act he commits in this film, there is a reason for that act. We understand why he is doing it, and we sympathize with him, even agree. <br/><br/>Deep character study and exposure is similarly exploited in Lensherr's ally and later opposite number, Charles Xavier. We also sympathize with him; he is a man with heart. This facet of the character is developed so well by the filmmakers, that when the character is 'wheelchaired' (I'm sure this is an obvious plot point even to the most naive viewer) I felt a genuine jolt of emotion surge through my body. <br/><br/>The special effects in this film are only used on top of the character development and storyline, like a layer of cheese on a particularly tasty pizza. This is also what sets the film out from other (so called) blockbusters in recent years. Effects are used only to polish off the human drama taking place on screen. And would you know it? The special effects and action sequences have a real weight. A certain scene at the end of the film involving some serious military hardware was eye popping, essentially because I was so invested in what was happening on screen.<br/><br/>Naturally, there are some faults with the film, the film score is a touch wooden and some of the younger cast have some poor acting moments. The issue of too many characters is rather obvious with this type of franchise, and despite the fact in cannot be helped, it does weigh the film some.<br/><br/>But as I said, the little bit of bad by no means outweighs the good, and the filmmakers have made a double investment with me – I will be returning for at least one more sequel."

The special effects aren't over the top. They don't need to be because the storyline is quite decent. Michael fassbender and james mcavoy both shine in this movie. Michael fassbender brings a lot of intensity and anfry malevolence to the role and james mcavoy adds some youthful charm to professor xavier. My only complaint would be that January jones is just present as eye candy. I also felt that nicholas hoult struggled a bit when it came to credibility but maybe thats just me."
"sg100","8","2","4","9 June 2011"," Good. Well worth seeing
","Good. Well worth seeing. <br/><br/>It's a reboot, so some of the character back stories may not make complete sense to anyone who knows the original history. Set in 1963 the film centres around the meeting of Charles Xavier (Professor X) and Eric Lensherr (Magneto) and the founding of Xavier's school for the gifted. <br/><br/>Eric's personal back story is given as flashback, and will seem remarkably familiar to anyone who's seen the previous X-films. Charles's story is somewhat different to what we've seen previously. <br/><br/>XM:FC explores the usual territory of difference and prejudice, but this time devotes a good proportion of the first third of the film to some good old fashioned, bond-like action. <br/><br/>The middle portion, as would be expected develops some of the other characters - this part drags a bit, but then again I'm probably not the target audience, not being a teenager. <br/><br/>The final third ratchets up the action and dramatic tension, if not quite as convincingly as the beginning. <br/><br/>I had some concerns about slight overplaying by the three main stars - Magneto twisting the air as if he had a Nazi's throat in his hands, and Prof-X touching his temple as if he was a circus mind reader. But I'll forgive them both some slight overacting, they didn't take it too far. Kevin Bacon on the other hand, took the 'big acting' a couple of steps further, but it seemed to suit his style and the evil ego-maniac character he played. <br/><br/>The kids all played their parts moderately well. <br/><br/>Overall, quite well done. As good as, may be better, than the first two X-films, and definitely better than the poor third on. The main praise should go to Matthew Vaughn, Jane Goldman and Bryan singer for a good action film."

","I had my hesitations going in to watch X-Men: First Class. I'm a big fan of the other films (for the most part), but this one seemed lackluster. The previews were somewhat misleading, however. So much more happens in the movie, and I was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>Firstly, I applauded most of the casting. Some very fine actors were included in this ensemble. Also, the storyline was great. It was the perfect mixture of background, action, humor, and mystery. It provided background into what made Magneto who he was today, as well as many of the other characters. This, mixed with the freshness of the young mutants, the typical lets-stop-the-bad-guy superhero plot, and the backdrop of the Second World War, kept me interested from start to finish. <br/><br/>One of the main things that made me love this movie so much was the amount of action and spectacular special effects jammed into the movie. Too much of stuff like this can seem cheap and gimmicky. I don't feel that was the case here, however. The X-men movies have such an array of potential, with all the different powers at hand. I'm glad they used it. Every other second I was wowed by their spectacular display of powers. Each action sequence fit in well with the plot, they had meaning. <br/><br/>In summary, First Class was a surprising treat.

"TheMovieDiorama","7","0","0","11 May 2020"," X-Men: First Class absorbs the heroic energy of its predecessors and outputs much needed youthful power.
","The Cuban Missile Crisis. A sociopolitical confrontation between the United States and Soviet Union having uncovered the latter's strategic tactic to deploy ballistic missiles in Cuba. What was supposedly an act of war between the biggest power nations on the globe, had in fact been initiated by genetically mutated individuals. Specifically Sebastian Shaw and his Hellfire Club, possessing the ability to absorb energy and transform its kinetic flow into raw strength. Humanity fear the mutants for their range of inexplicable abilities, outcasted by society. And thus, decimating the already existing stage of evolution through potential World War III will soon make room for a superior race of mutants and propel Shaw's exclusivist perspective.<br/><br/>A decade had swiftly passed since the initial release of X-Men, its fanbase and quality diminishing upon the release of latter sequels and spin-offs (poor Deadpool...). Franchise producer Kinberg suggested a loose adaptation of X-Men: First Class, and so Vaughn was employed to resurrect a rapidly declining series. How? By starting afresh. A prequel to the X-Men film universe. Establishing the discovery of mutants, the origins of both Professor X and Magneto, the conception of cringeworthy team names and, most importantly, how the X-Men themselves formed. From its promisingly dramatic introduction of Erik, as he becomes embroiled in grief and rage in the confinement of a Nazi concentration camp, to the altruistic intervention of the October Crisis of '62. Vaughn, alongside three other screenplay writers, managed to balance the general entertainment of superhero shenanigans with personable origins stories that held narrative gravitas, not seen since the exquisite sequel 'X2'.<br/><br/>The sole reason why First Class works as a prequel, is due to its foreshadowed acknowledgement of future relationships within the mutant community. Commencing the feature with Charles and Raven suddenly befriending each other, although unexplained, serves as lucid breadcrumbs for their eventual disintegration, as shown in prior entries, allowing viewers to become invested in each origin tale. Same with Erik's tantalising partnership with Charles. Everyone and their dog knows of their morally differing rivalry, however divulging into the events that initiated that contention allows audiences to experience complete different characters and how they developed over time. Charles in particular, a polite yet ego-fuelled telepathic, soon adopts the patriarchal figure for all things mutant that fans have known since the first film release. And that's exactly why First Class works. It's not just the extravagance of young mutants learning to harness their powers, from Havok's energy blasts to Banshee's ultrasonic screams. It's the tantalising origins of Magneto and Professor X. They singlehandedly give this prequel life, whilst never losing vision of the multilayered story that is to follow. Every notion, motive and emotional complexity interlock with each other to create a precious seed that has the opportunity to grow with its characters. McAvoy and Fassbender, undoubtedly, slaughter the entire competition. Their dynamic chemistry, ambitious acting abilities and sensational emotional connection truly rejuvenated the franchise. Bacon a close third, portraying a suave morally righteous antagonist with ornate bravura.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the female characters were somewhat lacking in intensity, turning First Class into a masculine showdown. Byrne's MacTaggart emphasising that notion by portraying the ""woman in a man's world"" archetype. Her, much like Mystique, Frost and Angel, seemed to have utilised their sex appeal far too often in the attire and abilities they reside in. Mystique especially, whom is a complex character, underplayed by Lawrence who was swallowed up by her male counterparts. A shame really. Various mutants, and there are plenty, were presented as tools instead of legitimate characters. Banshee, Riptide and Azazel in particular. A chance to showcase the visual effects that had been succinctly integrated. Darwin was adapted incorrectly, considering his theoretical invulnerability in ""adapting to survive"", and regrettably a wasted mutant within the film franchise.<br/><br/>Still, accompanied by Jackman's charged score and instantly epic theme tune, Vaughn's First Class manages to resurrect the X-Men that had since been buried on more than one occasion. Its broad scope and blockbusting visuals, condensed into an origin tale of two opposing ideologies that would exquisitely mould the themes of mutant supremacy and equality for future instalments. Despite the occasional clumsy plotting, it manages to be both entertaining and narratively complex, which is substantial enough to reinvigorate everyone's thirst for mutant heroics once more."
"williampsamuel","8","0","0","5 May 2020"," A First Class Origin Story
","X-Men First Class is just the thing to set the X-Men franchise back on solid ground. With strong acting, first rate action scenes, excellent directing, and more and better character development than the average popcorn flick, First Class puts the X-Men brand back on solid footing.<br/><br/>With a title like First Class, this movie is obviously a prequel, taking us back to the X-Men's beginnings. The story follows Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and Erik Lensherr, aka Magneto (Michael Fassbender) through the experiences that would make them the characters we recognize from later years. They're opposed by long time villain Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon), who in this version was the Nazi scientist who experimented on Erik in the death camps. Now he's hatched a plot to create a new ""master race' of mutants, one that does not bode well for humanity. Also included are Xavier's colleague Moria McTaggart, X-Men stalwarts Beast and Banshee, and fan favorites Emma Frost and Mystique.<br/><br/>The story is very good overall, even if veers quite a bit from that established in the comics. (Mystique as Charles's adopted sister?) I very much enjoyed the Cold War tensions and the alternate explanation for the Cuban Missile Crisis. I enjoyed even more the time spent on the main characters. Charles has lived a privileged life. His telepathic abilities have given him a deep empathy, and he is guided by the belief that he and other mutants will gain acceptance by using their gifts for the good of mankind. Towards this end, he joins the CIA's paranormal division aid in the fight with Shaw, and to recruit promising talent.<br/><br/>Erik has had a very different experience. The first manifestation of his powers took place upon entering a Nazi concentration camp, and in the following years he learned to harness that power by using his fear and anger. Now he is driven by a desire for revenge against those who wronged him, chief among them Sebastian Shaw. He's also filled with the belief, not unfounded, that what happened to his people will happen again to mutants. The difference in the pair's worldview is summed up in brief exchange over chess. Erik ""You think that all the humans are like Moria"" Charles ""And you think their all like Shaw.""<br/><br/>Plus the movie finds time to explore Mystique's insecurities and clinging need for love and acceptance, plus Beast's struggle with the well... beastly nature of his powers. Each member of the team is a well defined individual, with recognizable traits, rather than a mere stock character. And the filmmakers never forget that most of these people are practically kids. There are plenty of budding romances, and some rather ill-timed parties. Even Charles is a rather smooth talker around the ladies, and knows how to have a good time, which will come as something of a surprise to those who know only the serious, wizened Professor X.<br/><br/>I must confess that I didn't recognize any of the actors on sight, with the exception of Bacon, but I expect we'll be seeing much more of them in the future. They effortlessly fill their roles as idealist, conflicted future super villain, brilliant but awkward scientist, and more, and they bring a touch of believability to utterly fantastic scenarios. I would give McAvoy especially high marks. Without an actor of his skill, this film's version of Charles Xavier would never have worked.<br/><br/>The fight scenes are well done, and feature some non-obvious uses for the hero's powers. And there are some truly inspired visuals, particularly the one with the sub (You'll know it when you see it.) I will caution you that this isn't a movie for small children. There are some very frightening bits at the beginning and end, and most fanboys can tell you that where Emma Frost is involved, things are rarely family friendly.<br/><br/>For most audiences however, I would highly recommend X-Men First Class. It's action packed, often funny, and delivers on the excitement. But what lifts it above most similar offerings is the insight it brings to human nature and the lesson it brings about overcoming our basic instincts to truly prove that we are the better men."

","When the trailer for this film was first shown to me during some movie that I can't remember the title of, and I remember thinking, ""this looks TOTALLY BADASS!"" And guess what? It is. First Class serves as an extremely fitting double entendre of a title. The story takes place in the 1960s, with America and the Soviet Union on the brink of plunging the world into nuclear war. Erik (AKA Magneto), as we leaned way back in the first X-Men movie, is a small child taken from his parents during the Holocaust, and Charles (AKA Professor X) is a rich kid who has learnt of his ability to read minds. Both parts are played with incredible subtlety and emotion by Michael Fassbender and James McAvoy, respectively. Fassbender brings a perfect underscore of hidden menace that is completely faithful to the part, as everyone knows that Magneto and X go their very separate ways eventually. McAvoy, by contrast, always seems cool and calculated (to be expected of a hyper intelligent mind reader), until those few, very special scenes where he realizes he can no longer influence Erik to stray from the bad path he will inevitably take. The plot is basically X-Men Origins, which, without the Wolverine in the title, that would be just as fitting as First Class. Erik and Xavier are recruited by the CIA to help avert the coming apocalypse. They smartly know that they of course cannot do it by themselves, but instead discover (in a truly hilarious scene), that they aren't alone before they have even begun. They use Hank McCoy's machine called Cerebro (see X2 for further information on it) to find a whole generation of mutants, though we only get to see six or seven of them. In one of the few truly good montage sequences so cliched in film these days, these select mutants are discovered and recruited by the duo to aid in their war against war. These mutants play a surprisingly important role in the film, and admirably, none are used as vehicles for special effects showcases. Each one somehow manages to be depicted as fully characterized, fully human characters, and this is the trait whose lack is what plagued the previous two X-Men films. This exemplifies the stellar script that has been assembled for this film, with absolutely zero lines that seem campy or out of place. The same can be said of the various scenes, with each one having its own significance and meaning that helps drive the story forward. All of this is handled deftly by director Matthew Vaughn, whose previous film Kick Ass feels entirely modest and small by comparison. When I learned that this was the director assigned to the project, I was skeptical from the beginning, because I was worried that there would be unnecessary scenes and humor just stuffed in for good measure, as was done in Kick Ass. However, I am happy to say that I was wrong. Completely. In fact, I will say, wholeheartedly, that this ties X2 as the best film in the franchise, and even tops in in quite a few respects, making First Class at the very least equal to X2. Bryan Singer's two X-Men films paid a bit too much attention to the story, and sometimes seemed to just throw characters at the proverbial wall. This film pays equal attention to both aspects, and is a better movie for it. While it is not a subgenre definer, like The Dark Knight or Spider Man, it is a very good film that should be remembered alongside classics such as these."

The political overtones did not feel contrived or served as mere lip service but was integral to the story and the character's arcs. Visually, Vaughn is successful presenting a 60s vibe fit for the film.<br/><br/>My only real gripe for this is Magneto's arc.

","X men:First Class, the fifth installment of the X Men Film Series substantially uncovers the genesis of the mutant group of X Men(spearheaded by Prof.Charles Xavier) and the antagonist rival mutant group Brotherhood Of Mutants(marshalled by Erik Lehnsherr(familiar as Magneto)) to tackle the eternal unacceptability of mutants in the conventional human world.The movie has recurrent skewed allusions to Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962.
The film chronicles the confrontation between the aforementioned mutant groups with Sebastian Shaw, who is hell-bent on intimidating humans and usurping power to hegemonize the world.
The film flaunts an ensemble cast of Michael Fassbender, James McAvoy,Kevin Bacon and Jennifer Lawrence flunks at engendering the desired thrill, generally anticipated from the X Men films.The storyline is too predictable, and though Matthew Vaughn steers the film on individual acting performances, the ensuing chemistry between Fassbender and McAvoy fails to build up, thus rendering the film lacklustrousness and insipidity.Tough the inception of the mutant groups is effectively depicted, but fails to live up to the desirable expectations.
The ending seems illustrious and set-up, and though the conceived idea was beyond doubt, erudite, it's subsequent portrayal seems to be much below par.The risk of the commencement of third world war through the exploits of Sebastian Shaw seems a bit too far-fetched.The entire narrative of the cold-war was skewed to suit the film, with rare allusions to true facts.

","Prep for ""Dark Phoenix"" begins with the first of the prequel films for the main X-men series.<br/><br/>Erik Lensherr (Michael Fassbender) discovered his magnetic mutant powers under extreme duress as Sebastian Schmidt (Kevin Bacon) exploits the Nazi's reign of terror to instigate his own experiments. 12 years later, the now renamed Sebastian Shaw is interfering in both the Military and political landscapes in the US and the USSR, which brings him to the attention of the CIA, who contact Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) an expert on genetic mutations to assist them. But Lensherr has not forgotten the terrors of his youth, and is looking for revenge.<br/><br/>It was interesting to watch ""First Class"" again after all these years. In a few aspects, particularly from a visual standpoint, CGI has moved on quite a lot in just the 8 years since and a few of the effects don't stand up that well. There's no ""weight"" to a lot of them and a few specific examples, Beast running with Xavier as one, just look awful. Away from those concerns though, the film is pretty solid. It has one of the most straightforward and logical plotlines of film in this series, I understood the motivations for each of character and only really found that Mystique's ""accepting who she really is"" turnaround came without sufficient motivation. It's got quite a lot of humorous moments and a few references to the wider series, McAvoy talking about losing his fair, the Stryker family making their first appearance, what looks like a young Storm, Cameos from Rebecca Romjin and, of course, Hugh Jackman.<br/><br/>There are issues beyond the CGI. Michael Fassbender's accent wavers throughout and he's very Irish in the scenes towards the end. It's a little odd to see Mystique throw herself at both Beast and Magneto at a couple of points, you feel like they wouldn't make those choices were the film being made today. Minor quibbles in a very entertaining additional to the franchise."

","While prequels always hold the distinction of being the one type of movie that you know how it will end, seeing how they get there is certainly entertaining. Much like the Star Wars prequels gave us a point before the original trilogy to learn more about the background of the characters, the X-Men prequels manage to do this, but with a much better result. My only major qualm with prequel trilogies is that, while the mainstays of the franchise were there in terms of characters, the only ones who maintained their actor from the first set of movies were relegated to cameo appearances. This is only heightened by my opinion that the original X-Men trilogy's cast was perfect in almost every way. That being said, with the prequel trilogy now complete, the younger cast has definitely grown on me as well, James McAvoy's Xavier being my favorite of the prequel group.<br/><br/>Because X-Men: First Class starts well in the past, it does follow the ""origin story"" plot, not only of its main players like Professor Xavier (James McAvoy) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender), but of the start of the X-Men themselves. What's also nice about this is, because it occurs in the historical past, a certain element of ""altered history"" is present to make the whole plot feel somewhat more anchored in reality. It was also fun to see the X-Men in the trappings of the 1960's as well.<br/><br/>Of course, since this film came out more than a decade after X-Men (2000), the visual effects were certainly better than they had been. I appreciate the work Matthew Vaughn brought to this series as well. He's no Bryan Singer, but his directing was at least better than Brett Ratner.<br/><br/>With a retro feel and some flashy effects, this prequel was an entertaining film to watch. I give X-Men: First Class 4.0 stars out of 5."
"MickeyTheConstant","8","0","0","20 February 2019"," Really Good X-Men Movie
","I am a massive comic book geek and the X-Men were always my favourites. I loved the first 3 movies including The Last Stand. Will review that another time. Even so, the franchise was waning a bit and I felt First Class totally reinvented it. The issue with the previous movies was that the actors were aging a bit especially McKellan and Stewart. New blood was needed. Taking it back to the 60s was a great idea. People have been moaning about inconsistencies and timelines but hopefully by now they will have watched Days Of Future Past which explains things better and rationalises things. Big ticks in the box for the new recruits. For me Fassbender will always be the ideal Magneto. He just looks and acts the part. In the comics at times Magneto is bordering on being a tad unstable and Fassbender captures that. McAvoy was good also as a young Professor X although I did not get a real feel for him in Days Of Future Past where he is a hippie and a bit washed up. I thought the Hellfire Club were great too. The action sequences were top notch. My gripes, hmmm, Fassbenders Irish accent coming out often, the huge focus on Mystique who in the comics is not that big of a character and also the lack of screen time for Emma Frost who is a big character with strong powers. She got minimal action and seemed there for eye candy only. The visual look for Beast was poor also. Anyway, only a few gripes for what was a great movie."

Mutants don't wanna be seen as those monsters. Especially Mystique, here played by Jennifer Lawrence who never fits into that role as good as Rebecca Romijn. The best moments of the film are between Fassbender and James McAvoy as Charles Xavier. Director Matthew Vaughn understands perfectly that these two are friends who are stronger and better together but are divided by their different worldviews. Sebastian Shaw, the leader of the Hellfire Club, is a nice villain for this origin story. He works way better than anything that X-Men: The Last Stand threw at us.

","The pacing of the first half of the movie is so fast that it's the responsible for all the movie's flaws; the motivations for joining the team aren't convincing or rather they made all the mutants aren't different from each others (actually it is one motivation that you should understand yourself), the humor didn't work for me (despite the fact that the jokes aren't bad at all) and the dull dialogue between the villain and the heroes revealed all the evil plans. But actually this very pacing made this movie one of the most entertaining superhero movies I've ever seen. Also, all these flaws are only in the first half of the movie as I said and they are nothing if we compared them to the many positives of this movie; the visuals are stunning, all the performances are great (specially from McAvoy and Fassbender as well as their characters), Magneto's dramatic scenes in this movie maybe are the best in the entire franchise, the cheesiness in this movie is amiable and amusing, even the humor gets much more better in the second half of the movie. the action sequences are stylish and the plot is simple but strong. without a doubt it's one of my favorite X-Men movies."
"Floated2","7","0","0","15 October 2017"," Successful start of the franchise
","X-Men: First Class is the first film of the X-Men series that we seen start which released few more sequels. This film tells the origin story of how the superheroes became what they were and shows how it all started. The film is fast paced but at times slows down to show the in depth details of each character. Of all the things that went right with this film, was casting of James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender as the young versions Patrick Stewart's Xavier and Ian McKellen's Magneto respectively. Bringing the dramatic polish they honed on such films as Atonement and Hunger, they give soul and believability to what could otherwise have been a tragic, worthless repeat of the empty. Overall First Class was a successful and engaging start to a successful franchise which has grown over the years."

"alindsay-al","9","0","0","17 May 2016"," A fantastic resurgence of the franchise
","With X-Men apocalypse coming out very soon I thought I would re watch this film and I think it's even better then the previous times I've watched it. The premise is set in the 1960s Where a young Charles Xavier and Erick lensher meet and form the X-Men against world war 3. James mcavoy plays young Xavier in this film and I thought he did a great job in this film. He understands the character and does a great job of bringing out the younger side of him who is intelligent and wise but has more social skills. Michael fassbender plays lensher who is on a quest for vengeance. I love this character because it has so many layers to it he tries to do good but you understand the rage inside of him and how it consumes him at times. Also the chemistry between the two actors is awesome with them really playing well off of each other. Kevin bacon plays the villain Sebastian Shaw and he does a really good job as the over the top bad guy. He does have a bit of depth to him and I really like his relationship with fassbender in the film. Nicholas hoult plays hank mccoy, aka beast in this film and he does a really good job in this film adding allot of depth to the characters and also his development with mystique does work for this film. Rose Byrne plays Moira mctaggert in this film and she is a good companion in this film because she is the human involved so you see most of the actions through her eyes and she does a good job. Jennifer Lawrence is a great actress but I would see her portrayal of raven aka mystique wasn't that interesting. For the most part she is just a partying teenager troubled with the way she looks. I mean it does kind of work when paired with beasts arc but it just wasn't that interesting to me. The story has a great relationship between mcavoy and fassbender where you truly understand both of there points of view as they try to survive as mutants. However, my main problem of this film is Shaw's overall plan. No spoilers but it just doesn't make much sense at all with the information that the film gives you. The script has some great dramatic moments and dialogue between it. It also has little well placed humour that makes the characters feel real. The style of the film is great, with the action scenes being more hard hitting but also a spectacle. Overall this is a fantastic film that should be seen by all comic book fans."
"sandnair87","9","0","0","11 January 2016"," 'X-Men: First Class' Makes The Grade!
","X-Men: First Class unfolds by deliciously setting up the yin-and-yang between the mutant population's two most powerful people. On the one hand is Charles Xavier (James McAvoy), who is eager to help mutants like himself - he's a telepath - and his shape-shifting best friend Raven (Jennifer Lawrence) and seek acceptance from non-mutant humans. On the other hand is the metal-manipulating Erik Lensherr (Michael Fassbender), who's bent on destroying the former Nazi scientist (Kevin Bacon) responsible for killing his mother in the Warsaw ghetto in 1944.<br/><br/>Set primarily in 1962, the script sets up Charles and Erik as allies. Their mission is to stop that Nazi doctor, now a businessman named Sebastian Shaw who also has mutant energy-absorbing powers and has gathered his squad of mutants, from pushing the Americans and Soviets into launching a nuclear war. But in battling Shaw, Charles and Erik also argue between themselves. Charles seeks acceptance of mutants from humans, even encouraging his lab genius to create a serum to make mutants appear ""normal."" Erik takes a more radical stance, arguing mutants should never have to hide who they are and should fight humans, even the more sympathetic ones.<br/><br/>Using the Cuban Missile Crisis as a backdrop, X-Men: First Class delivers a riveting action drama, mixing whiz-bang special effects with a story of Shakespearean proportions, and in the process writing a fascinating mutant-based alternative history of the early 1960s. Dropping a genre film in the middle of a historic event immediately and successfully adds depth, substance and helps place the characters in the proper chronology.<br/><br/>On the acting front, McAvoy's Professor X is more relatable than Patrick Stewart's in the original trilogy. He is still as much a genius, but maintains his boyish charm and an accessibility that has yet to have been afforded to X's character. Fassbender similarly takes his Magneto to a new place, trading the campiness of Ian McKellen's character and focusing more instead on Erik' anguish and tragic past, delivering a standout performance. Together they provide a wonderful centerpiece for the film with their two characters, displaying some great chemistry.<br/><br/>But the glue that holds the whole film together and balances everything on a thin wire like a stage magician is Matthew Vaughn. He keeps the complex globe-hopping story moving fluidly, peppered with moments of good humor and high drama. The movie deals with the age old dilemma of power over peace, but credit is deserved to Vaughn for managing this aspect so attentively, and being delicately precise with the emotional baggage involved. Most superhero movies would not even attempt to cover a subject like this with such a high maturity level.<br/><br/>Whether or not you're an avid fan of the comic book series, this class graduates with top marks!"

","I rarely if ever have added a spoiler to my reviews here, and I shall not now. <br/><br/>First I'll say that I've recently been watching the entire X-Men series in chronological order for essentially the first time (I'd seen the first film when it was released but watched it again here), and went in without any influence or expectations (I don't even read the story off the box first), so each film was watched with a thoroughly open mind. Since I'm not going to review each one on IMDb, I'll only say that the only one that I didn't like was ""Wolverine: Origins"". That movie was awful; the rest were good to very good.<br/><br/>I expected First Class to be marketing on the X-Men franchise but without adding anything unique or relevant to the story; however, I was pleasantly wrong. In fact, I found it to be quite entertaining, well acted, and slightly significant to the rest of the series. <br/><br/>Only minor complaint was, could they have hired actors to play young Magneto and Professor X that look any less like their older counterparts? When the only physical requirement for casting was that they were thin, white, and British, it made the whole connection with the older versions too difficult. Neither styles nor mannerisms presented by Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen were attempted by the younger actors."

","I was always a bit lukewarm about the original X-Men trilogy, and was really underwhelmed by the Wolverine back story prequels, so I've come out the other side of this film concluding it's the best one yet (still to see Days of Future Past).<br/><br/>The one feature I did always look forward to in the originals was the confrontation between Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen as the respective goodie and villain, and James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender's channeling of their older counterparts is probably the highlight of this picture. In terms of the film itself, it's a fairly well crafted plot, nicely paced, and well acted - nothing too special, but a solid watch.<br/><br/>I think the element of this movie that elevates it above its predecessors most, however, is the thought that has gone into the development of the characters, and background of the story. With the originals, CGI was still growing in popularity, and quite large sections of those films were spent oohing and ahing at the various mutations and asking 'what can this one do?' and there is a bit of this in that (the girl with the bug wings stands out), but it doesn't take centre stage as with those previous efforts, to the benefit of the film overall. Being set amidst the backdrop of the Cuban Missile Crisis, there's a nice political subtext when unraveling the motivations and backgrounds of the two leads, and that context gives a lot more weight to the story than with the first three films and the Wolverine origins stories, which seemed to exist in bubble-like isolation from the real world at times.<br/><br/>So a strong 7, I look forward to seeing the next installment if it's anything like this one."

Still, I've heard a lot of bad things about Lawrence, but I thought she was quite good. I thought both Fassbender and McAvoy were aces, and their relationship incredibly satisfying.

I thought, for a prequel - which, let's face it, is just an excuse to milk a few extra quid out of the franchise's audience - it was actually okay. It did a good job of showing us a backstory that we didn't know, i.e. how Professor X and Magneto went from friends to enemies (George Lucas could take note as to how to write prequels!). Everything seemed to fit together well and tie up all the loose ends. Plus there wasn't too much pointless action and the special effects seemed just right (although I just watched Transformers 3, so I'm all CGIed out right now!). It felt more like a spy film with super powers.<br/><br/>All in all, good fun.

However director Matthew Vaughn has injected a lot of love and verve here.<br/><br/>Like X-Men 1, the film starts in a concentration camp during World War 2 where Dr Schmidt/Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) is experimenting on Jews and Mutants including a young boy called Erik Lensherr.<br/><br/>In New York City, a telepathic boy, Charles Xavier meets a young shape-shifter called Raven (Jennifer Lawrence), whose natural form is a scaly blue-skin.<br/><br/>Xavier invites her to live with his family as a sort of foster sister.<br/><br/>After graduation from Oxford University, Xavier later meets the more volatile Lensherr who discovers that Shaw is also a powerful mutant and wants to take him down for what he did to him in World War 2.<br/><br/>Yet at the same time there is something about Shaw's outlook that attracts Lensherr and this causes friction with Xavier.<br/><br/>Here is an origins story that really meshes with the X-Men films as we see the forming of the friendship with Professor X (James McAvoy) and Erik Lensherr/Magneto (Michael Fassbender.)<br/><br/>Both actors excel in their roles.

It's a good start especially if the most important part of this exercise is to get good young actors to refresh the franchise. James McAvoy is the new Charles Xavier. Jennifer Lawrence is Mystique. Nicholas Hoult is Beast. Michael Fassbender is Magneto. With them as well as others, the franchise looks to be on solid grounds. As for this movie itself, it's a little bit slow at times. I think we're suppose to go weak in the knees every time a new actor for each iconic role is revealed. It's still great to see the new actors in action. They'll probably grow into their roles in the next movie. This is a solid starting point."

The film is 132 minutes long, but honestly, felt much longer. I was bored at parts, and this you do not expect from a film franchise that is action-based. I like Jones as Emma Frost. She became my favorite character and the only other character I found myself cheering on besides Magneto. I would have liked to see a different actress play the young Mystique because I felt her acting to be poor and lackluster.

","It is interesting how this movie came about, as the other X-Men movies were being made th writer/director/actors often had to make a reference to what might have happened in earlier years, in the time when the characters were younger. Thus ""X-Men Origins"" was made. There is a good explanation of the process in the DVD extras.<br/><br/>While this story actually begins in the 1940s during the Nazi suppression of the Jews, most of it takes place in 1962 when the characters would have been in their 20s. In fact, to take advantage of real historical elements, the climax of this movie is the October 1962 Cuban Missle crisis, and the young X-Men have a role in its outcome.<br/><br/>James McAvoy is Charles Xavier and Michael Fassbender is Erik Lehnsherr, who becomes known as Magneto. This story shows how they were friends, and started out on the same side of justice. It also shows what contributed to their going in different directions, and how Xavier ended up wheelchair bound. <br/><br/>The most evil character is Kevin Bacon as Sebastian Shaw, intent on facilitating a Third World War. Jennifer Lawrence of most recently ""Hunger Games"" fame as Katniss, is Raven here, eventually becoming known as Mystique.

","This is by no comparison the best X-Men movie to date in my opinion. Director Matthew Vaughn previously known for his shocker film Kick-Ass brings the story of how the friendship of Magneto and Professor X became a rivalry. The movie is set during the events of the Cuban Missile crisis which is a nice tie in and introduces several characters from the comic books to us. We get a stellar cast led by Wanted star James McAvoy and rising star Michael Fassbender. Kevin Bacon stars as the main villain behind all the treachery and a person foe to Magneto's character. The film is well paced, and although we don't go too in depth with each of the individual mutant characters, it's enough to make you care fro the ones on screen. There is great dialogue written into the script which never enters the cheese factor and keeps it pretty straight forward. There are great action set pieces along with amazing FX and steady camera work that doesn't shake up the action to the point of it being blurred. This is a fun, energetic and relentlessly entertaining movie from start to finish. Even though he is not behind the directors chair, Bryan Singer was part of the experience of making this movie and it shows through subtle nuances. We also get some great cameos, one in particular which brought the house down with laughter when I was in the theater.

The new first class runs 132 minutes and is directed by Matthew Vaughn.<br/><br/>This story is set in the 1960's with Charles Xavier and Erik lensherr and the young x men learning about their abilities during the time of the cold war Cuban missile crisis. This film bring s back characters raven/ mystique played by (Jennifer Lawrence), Hank McCoy/ beast played by (Nicholas Hoult) from previous films. The first class introduces Banshee played by (Caleb laundry Jones) havoc played by (Lucas Till), Darwin played by (Edi gathegi). They are brought in by the cia to help prevent a chance at possible nuclear war aka; the Cuban missile a crisis of the 1960's that is being fueled by fellow mutant and mischief maker Sebastian Shaw and his crew of trouble making mutants.<br/><br/>While talking a tour of the cia hank show's Charles a machine he invented called cerebro. It s' meant to help find other people with similar powers like them. They go about finding other mutants such as Riptide( Alex Gonzalez),Angel Salvador( Zoë kravitz), Jason Flemynug Azazel), Banshee(Caleb Landry Jones), and Havock (Lucas Til). They find out that a fellow mutant Sebastian Shaw ( Kevin Bacon) and his cohorts Riptide( Alex Gonzalez) Jason Flemynug ( Azazel) and the beautiful Emma Frost ( January Jones) have their own plans to create world war 3. The struggles the x men took to learn and harness there abilities with the help of Charles Xavier was very well told.The story of magneto from the time he was a child in the prison camp to his obsession with Sebastian Shaw, who murdered his mother right in front of him as a child took on batman begins type tone.He sets out across the country to find clues and discover who he is and take revenge on Sebastian Shaw for his mother's death.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the films use of the script to mention the future. They had a scene where a young hank was showing Charles cerbo. Hank asks Charles are you sure you don't want to shave your head before you use it Charles say s don't touch my hair. Charles makes reference to him teaching and says before you know it I'll be old and bald. The cameos of Huge Jackman/wolverine, and Rebecca Romijn / mystique add to the appeal of the film. While Charles and Erik are out looking for mutants they come across wolverine in a bar they introduce themselves wolverine just looks at them says go F yourself. Rebbecca Romain shows up when a young mystique tries to seduce Erik and she asks do you like this side of me.<br/><br/>I have to admit the one thing I didn't like was Kevin bacon as a villain he didn't cut the mustard as a far being a villain. Other than that they did a great job bringing the x men franchise back to the beginning excellent script, acting , the use of old news footage to reenact the cold war. I think it was the best marvel film I have seen so far. I give the x-men first class 8 out of 10 stars."

","The movie starts by introducing young Erik and Charles. Erik in the concentration camps, Charles meeting a young Mystique for the first time. What's not explained is where Charles was or why Mystique was even there to begin with. Was it an early school for mutants? Was she an intruder? Nothing was explained other than showing Charles to be a gentle soul and that would carry over throughout the rest of the flick with the exception of him using the same pickup line to hit on chicks in bars. No trailer advertised Kevin Bacon to be in the movie at all so there was that reaction from the audience when people recognized him. It was kinda like seeing Sigourney Weaver and even Michelle Rodriguez in Avatar. The best bit of acting in the whole movie? Bill Milner's, who played young Erik, facial expressions after seeing his mother shot in front of him.<br/><br/>Despite the large cast of characters, this is a plot-driven movie. It all revolves around the Cold War, specifically the Cuban Missile Crisis. In this case, you know there's a twist and it ain't a bad one but the execution was weak. I like how they took a real life event and used it as a backdrop for the growing mutant phenomena. I don't like how almost everything was watered down. I don't have much for complaints about the acting but this is essentially a war movie that focuses on things going on outside of the main conflict, mainly the mutants.<br/><br/>Mutants are introduced slowly but surely and X team members are given code names along the way. Reminds me a lot of G.I. Joe Renegades but that's a very well written cartoon. The script here isn't bad. The direction is what's lacking. It just doesn't come across as serious enough and I can understand why considering the franchise. There are those emotional, crying moments but not enough hardcore, violent ones. Nothing to make you really wanna hate the protagonist (Bacon playing Sebastian Shaw). Shaw's ideals are like those of the primates in the Planet of the Apes movies (minus Aldo) where mutant shall not kill mutant. Can't hate the guy for that, can you?<br/><br/>Lots to like but let's look at the characters and how the lack of attention in that department hurts the movie. First off, during the gentleman's club scene, they show a lot of scantily clad chicks. Where's the problem with that, you ask? The movie is based in 1962. Chicks didn't look then the way they do now so it was bad casting on that front. It's like casting Olivia Wilde in Cowboys & Aliens; a movie based in the 1800's.<br/><br/>The hair styles are another issue. Alex Summers has a pretty modern do along with the Angel character. Emma Frost's hair, and emotionless characterization, was atrocious. It looked like she was wearing a wig with a whole can of mousse in it. Just terrible. Speaking of Angel, considering her real life heritage and skin color in the movie, would she really be openly employed as a stripper in a predominately white club in the 60's? And with tattoos? Redbone's got it bad enough these days, imagine how it must have been back then? And being a 60's based movie, it didn't have a 60's feel at all.<br/><br/>And my biggest complaint is the characterization. X-fans know who the Darwin character is. The way he was killed didn't make sense considering that he constantly evolves to survive. That includes becoming pure energy as proved in the comics. I'm surprised they even used Darwin in this movie. The actor who played him looked the part perfectly, I'll admit that. But why they always gotta kill the black guy first?<br/><br/>There were some issues with nationalities but you don't hear anyone complaining about it like whitewashing in movies like The Last Airbender. Moira's supposed to be Scottish. Banshee Irish. Does Magneto really look or sound Jewish to you? He was underpowered when the movie started but suddenly has greater control and levitation abilities at the end. Charles' influence certainly couldn't have been the cause of that level of change so quickly. Script issue! That's when Magneto goes villain but it wasn't on the level of Hulk Hogan going Hollywood at Bash at the Beach '96. What could have been this great cinematic moment didn't have enough behind it to matter which is exactly how the overall viewing experience can be described.<br/><br/>You'd think the ending of the movie with all the special effects like the raised submarine would be totally epic but it's not. The problem there IS the special effects. The submarine crash looks just as bad as the plane crash scene in Air Force One. They should have hired the people who did the plane crash scene in Knowing because that looked very realistic. Is there sequel potential here? I'd say there's definitely room for more X movies but they should stand alone like the James Bond flicks.<br/><br/>The movie checked in at just over 2 hours. Didn't feel like it was too long or too short. The movie was entertaining but it's too simple for my taste. I like my movies with more depth and a less comic-book style ending than the one it presented. I give this 5.5 out of 10 stars. Nothing special or memorable really happens and it's not worth paying any amount of money for but if you're an X-fan, you're gonna see it anyway. You're better off waiting for the DVD because you'll be disappointed shelling out the dough at a movie theater for this. Then again, some are more easily impressed than others. I'm part of the others. Don't bother sticking around after the credits. Nothing happens to the verbal dismay of those who stuck around hoping for something."

","I simply loved this movie, finally i saw something that i could relate to my childhood comics, i love the X-men and Wolverine, my brother would instead love Spiderman, x-men was what life was all about for me, the difference and accepting difference, tolerance agaisnt others that think and are different of you, this movie has all of it, but more, it show us character dept in a way that even Hugh Jackman never did, i love wolverine and i prefer the actor that made magneto in this movie, the ending is one of the best, u can even empathize with Magneto in the ending speech, i mean, u understand and u can relate with the bad guy! it almost lurches u into his side, i think half of the x-men fans agree with him and half agree with charles, the heroes are amazing and even not having such great powers u prefer those heroes to Harry Potter friends, or Twilight vampires and werewolfs, and the bad ass of this film Shaw? it's so great what kevin does with him, the way he acts the villain, i mean, i never given a damn to Shaw, i thought he wasn't that powerful, never understand his importance and now i can understand he's truly something, but the geniality behind all this is the story behind Magneto, his character is the best, the scene in the bar should embarrass Tarantino ""Inglorious Bastards"", just thought the queen of Hellfire should have been played by a better actress, but anyway, definitely way better then the other X-Men movies, it should have started with this one, cause in this one they respect the characters, it's not a bunch of good looking kids showing up to be heroes, this heroes are real good actors, and it shows in every second of the movie, looking back on the other movies they seem so bad compared to this one, Brian Singer for me is not a good director, this one is starting to be a great one, i just hope they do the same with Wolverine what they did with X-Men, cus i didn't like Wolverine movie either, and i hope, even though i loved Magneto character in this one(i hated him in all the others, it was simply bad) i want to see another foe, Magneto is not the only foe of X-Men, how is it possible that with 5 movies about X-Men and Wolverine, we didn't got to see Apocalipse or Sinister? it's an imperial that the next movie has one of those, even if Magneto is so damn good in this one! For me the only X-Men movie so far, u can burn the others..."

","Another good X-men film, guys! I have to tell you, I saw this almost a week after its release and I thought ''the theater will be empty''. I was freaking wrong. Every one was there for this film, turns out X-men are pretty popular in my country too.<br/><br/>When I first learned that this movie was in the works, I felt somehow disappointed. I hated ''X-men Origins: Wolverine'' and I always used to say ''why can't they just leave us with the original trilogy?''. I really liked the first three (X-3 was a bit of a let-down). But when I saw the movie I changed my mind. It was one of the best comic book movies I've ever seen!<br/><br/>The casting was very good and the script is well written and it gives us a chance to see our beloved characters (Professor X & Magneto) back when they were young, friends and how/why they became adversaries. The CGI is incredible -might I say it's better than Thor's a bit- and the music very intense. But the best thing was the direction. Matheww Vaughn was better than I would have hoped, with incredible shots, characters' depth and a perfect tone for the film. It's not as dark as ''The Dark Knight'' but it wasn't as comedic as ''Fantastic Four''.<br/><br/>The thing I enjoyed more was the characters they chose for the story. Every single mutant plays a pivotal role in the film. There is only a few things I didn't like. Magneto's uniform when he departs the team ( Ian McKellen's was better by far) and I expected Magneto and Professor X to be friends since 17-18 years old. This doesn't happen in this film. They meet each other far later. But their relationship is explored in very good way.<br/><br/>To sum it up, either you are a comic book fan or not, you must go and see this movie. It's clever, it's entertaining and with a nice climax. It's worth it. You 're even gonna enjoy the little cameos they've put in there for comic geeks.....Go see it my friends..."
"shez-dogg","8","3","8","16 June 2011"," A really great REBOOT
","First of all, this movie is a reboot, NOT a prequel, of the X-Men franchise. This means that, according to movie law, it doesn't have to be awful! Yipee!<br/><br/>X-Men: First Class is the story of the start of X-Men. It is set during the cold war, when Charles Xavier and Eric (aka professor X and Magneto) meet. <br/><br/>It is important to mention that this movie does not have Wolverine in. Yes, I hear you say, how can you have an X-Men film with no Wolverine? That's like cereal with no milk! (and if you eat cereal without milk, you're weird) But there is no gaping hole in the movie, as it is like no other in the franchise.<br/><br/>The beginning is actually set during the holocaust, when Eric's powers are being discovered. Throughout the movie his anger and pain from his experiences come through in the form of a thirst for his tormentor's blood. <br/><br/>However, Charles Xavier's pretty care free youth seems to reflect his calm attitude. It is actually a surprisingly impressive performance, as his interaction with the other characters (especially Eric) is really very convincing. His mentoring makes him seem like that really good teacher you had in school. <br/><br/>The dialogue, I admit, is sometimes quite weak, but on the whole the script is solid. The direction is also solid, with some very tense parts (usually involving a rather angry Eric) are pretty edge-of-your-seat. <br/><br/>On the whole, this movie is very enjoyable. It's not flawless, it's not jump-up-and- celebrate good, but I would definitely recommend it, as I really liked it. Not much goes wrong in this great cold war/superhero movie."
"lordbyte","4","3","8","12 June 2011"," Weak film, the only actors who showed any form of character were the baddies
","The new heroes are weak. It seems they just made up powers at random and shoehorned them in just to not look like they took them from any other comic. None of them get any decent character building, and the ones that do come out as total a-holes. Only half-decent characters are the ones masterfully played by both bad guys (Magneto and the villain of the film). Mystique at times tried to put something into her role but the terribly clichéd writing made her feel just as unreal and one-dimensional as the others. Even as a pop-corn film it just irritated the s**t out of me, and the plot-holes and shoehorned humans are bad 'mkay ending just ruined it all for me. I was glad it was over. Too long, too clichéd, too one-dimensional. They tried nothing new, they didn't even try to make the characters memorable, and only two actors actually brought something to the screen. The special effects were good though. 4 out of 10."
"Eternality","8","3","8","3 June 2011"," While it is too much of a stretch to call First Class a great superhero film, it remains to be one of the better efforts in recent years.
","The X-Men films have seen Bryan Singer (The Usual Suspects, 1995), the Oscar-winning Gavin Hood (Tsotsi, 2005), and even Brett Ratner (Rush Hour trilogy, 1998, 2001, 2007) taking on the directorial roles. Now put Matthew Vaughn onto that list. Fresh from the success of Kick-Ass (2010), Vaughn delivers again a blockbuster that effortlessly blends brawn and brains in a motion picture that not only entertains, but provides this summer with a title that is worth remembering. With four quite excellent features to his credit, Vaughn is now surely one of the few aces working in Hollywood.<br/><br/>In the universe of X-Men, Vaughn's film is a prequel to all the other films, though it could also be classified as a reboot (or preboot to a reboot?) of a franchise most well-known for Hugh Jackman's Wolverine. He does make a funny cameo here, but Vaughn's intention is to show that X- Men is more than just the man with metal claws. In X-Men: First Class, the popular characters are now played by a new set of actors, with James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender leading the way with their portrayals of Charles Xavier (or Professor X) and Erik Lehnsherr (or Magneto).<br/><br/>The film shows how their characters come into light, and how they evolved into who we know they are today. A large supporting cast is headed by Oscar nominee Jennifer Lawrence, who plays blue shapeshifter Mystique. Set in the early 1960s when America faced the threat of the Cuban Missile Crisis by the Soviets, First Class chronicles literally the formation of the first batch of X-Men recruits as they battle evil mutants (led by Kevin Bacon's Sebastian Shaw) hell-bent on starting World War III.<br/><br/>First Class takes a while to pick up as back stories are told with some detail, but when it does eventually speeds up after about thirty minutes, it becomes tremendously engaging. The film is well-edited, especially a ""recruit training"" sequence midway through that not only makes effective use of alternating split-screens that pump up the adrenaline, but provides a key emotional moment between Charles and Erik that would have far-reaching consequences. The action sequences are visually engrossing, but more importantly, they are directed with clarity so that we know what is happening.<br/><br/>Although I feel that Vaughn's film is slightly overrated, I still think it is a pretty decent superhero film. It comes with several flaws though, most notable of which is the lack of character development and motivation of the supporting mutant characters. At a considerable ""long"" runtime of about 135 minutes, I thought there should have been ample time to address this. Another problem is that the setting is a tad too sleek and futuristic for a film set in the 1960s, such that when John F. Kennedy's black-and-white televised speech comes onto the screen, it seems jarring to the eye.<br/><br/>While it is too much of a stretch to call First Class a great superhero film, it remains to be one of the better efforts in recent years. With Fassbender finally anchoring a lead role in a major Hollywood film, it is a good opportunity to see how talented the German-Irish actor really is. With news that there could be two sequels to this, I am all for that to happen as long as Vaughn continues to write and direct, with Singer producing.<br/><br/>GRADE: B+ (8/10 or 3.5 stars)<br/><br/>www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com <br/><br/>All rights reserved."
"MartinHafer","8","3","8","3 June 2011"," While not the best of the Marvel films, it's highly entertaining and fun.
","I am not a comic book fan. I like films based on the characters but unlike my oldest daughter and many in the audience, I was not looking to see if this movie is exactly like the X-Men comics. So, if you are such a fan, I might not be the best reviewer to read. However, I did notice that this movie pretty much ignored this hard-core audience. Unlike practically every Marvel film for the bast decade or two, there was no cameo by Stan Lee--none. And, unlike the typical Marvel film, Fox chose not to include any special extras scene at the end of this film (though there was a cute cameo with Wolverine part-way through the film). Because of this, I felt bad for the audience, as I saw it at the midnight show on opening night--and could see and hear the hard-core fans' disappointment--in particular because there was no appearance by Lee. According to my insanely devoted daughter, she read Lee's tweets and apparently he was never even asked to do a cameo for ""X-Men: First Class""! Sadly, the film seems only intended for the casual viewer when just a tiny bone would have pleased the fan base.<br/><br/>Now as for the film itself, it was great. The script was highly imaginative and managed to incorporate real-life events into the X-Man universe. Little did I realize that the Cuban Missile Crisis was actually instigated by the Xs!! In addition to a dandy script (where, incidentally, it sure looked like there was a love connection brewing between Xavier and Magneto), I liked the acting, action and pace. At well over two hours, I was happy as there were no obvious lags.<br/><br/>However, being a natural born complainer, there was one other big thing that bothered me. There was a great black X-Man character but he was handled horribly--and I could see the black audience feeling alienated by some DUMB decisions in the film. First, in one scene, the word ""slave"" is used--and the camera pans directly on the black character! Second, only minutes later, the black guy was DEAD!!!! This is an offensive cliché---and although I am NOT a politically correct nut, it was obvious and ticked me off, as it was totally unnecessary. Could this have been handled better...heck, yeah!! A minor thing that bothered me (I am a retired history teacher) is that many of the characters' hair styles were from 1962 but many were also straight from 2011. Another minor one is the use of songs that didn't yet exist--such as WWII soldiers listening to Edith Piaf's ""La Via En Rose""--a song that came out in 1946--a year after the war. These were a bit sloppy but were minor mistakse. Still, it is a good film--well worth seeing and fun--just a few mistakes short of perfect."
"neil-476","10","3","8","2 June 2011"," Rock solid and hugely enjoyable
","I don't want to rehash the plot of this X-Men origins movie - either you don't care because you're not interested, or you're looking forward to the movie and want to find out for yourself, or you're so keen to know that you've looked it up already. Suffice it to say that, like the best adaptations, there's enough of the original material to remain true to the spirit, but enough variation to keep you interested and surprised. It is a very satisfying story with - so importantly! - a very good script.<br/><br/>The film is brilliantly cast and the performances are uniformly excellent, with the central performances of McAvoy and Fassbender being the note-perfect glue which holds the whole thing together (please excuse the mixed metaphor!). Jennifer Lawrence's Raven is also a creation of shifting emotional layers.<br/><br/>The effects and set pieces are executed flawlessly, with the sole exception of Emma Frost changing back from diamond form, which doesn't really convince (neither does January Jones, who doesn't really convey very much of the Emma Frost I expected).<br/><br/>There is a single, completely unnecessary, F-bomb.<br/><br/>Overall, though, this film is great fun, terrifically entertaining, carries some emotional wallop, and has jumped straight to first place as my favourite X-Men film."
"raj_ak_ajodhia","9","3","8","1 June 2011"," Way better than the previous X-men installments
","So I just returned from the cinema, and well,I'm really pleased. The 1st thing you may notice is that this movie differs from..well..all other previous marvel movies! While these movies mostly focused on effects and action sequences and (unfortunately) less on the storyline,X men 1st class stands out both in action and storyline! There's character development, great action scenes, outstanding acting with a great supportive cast, what more can you ask!!!!!<br/><br/>Sure when looked at things like continuity,there are many things that will bother you, but just enjoy the ride for what it is!!! Not everyone may like this movie,cause it's different and maybe quite lengthy,but overall it's definitely worth a try!<br/><br/>For me 'X-men 1st Class' is better than the recently released THOR and as good as DC's 'The Dark Knight'."
"jonathan-mccann","10","3","8","1 June 2011"," Forget continuity and accents and this is very enjoyable.
","I'll keep this brief.<br/><br/>Pros Excellent setup/style and overall 60's feel right down to a young McAvoy Charles saying ""Groovy :P when hitting on the ladies in an English pub. The action was great the effects were 90% good. The comedy and tragedy were both there and delivered well.<br/><br/>Cons The thing that lets this down is the sounds most importantly the voices in relation to their characters. Emma Frost, Moira and Banshee sounded very wrong and the blue versions of mystique and beast did not have the trademark un-natural voices.<br/><br/>Very good reboot nonetheless. THis does not tie into any of the other X films well."

","X Men: First Class is a real comeback for a franchise that could of, but didn't, loose its original 'shi-bang' as it were. This new addition to the series has brought it back to life, and back better than ever, this instalment is by far the best with fantastic acting, superb directing and mind-blowing action.<br/><br/>Not only does this film deliver a new, untold story, but it also caters for those non-X Men fans with funny lines, character development and plays at a fast and exciting pace. This addition also ties up various loose ends that the previous films (although chronologically latter films) didn't answer, with the odd joke along the way.<br/><br/>Not forgetting the cameo with Wolverine, that was fabulous, I doubt that was cheap.<br/><br/>X Men: First Class has a franchise of its own, and I hope to see another soon."
"evan_harvey","7","4","13","7 June 2011"," It's okay. Not brilliant, but better than Origins: Wolverine
","The latest X-Men movie is okay. The best one is still X-Men 2. #1 was good. #3 sucked. Origins: Wolverine was disappointing, and the latest effort is not too bad. Unfortunately, though, there's nothing really good about it either.<br/><br/>Other than charting the rise of Professor X and Magneto, it's all a bit dull, I found. It lacks drive and at times feels more like a rehash of concepts from the first 3 in the series, rather than the exploration of something new.<br/><br/>It takes place during the Cold War, which is because it's really the last event after World War 2 that the US wasn't facing unpopular coverage over. Unfortunately, the Cold War, and specifically the Cuban Missle Crisis doesn't really resonate that much anymore.<br/><br/>The story was written partly by Bryan Singer (who worked on the first 2 X-Men films before Brett Ratner insulted us with X-Men 3), and it's a little out of sync with both X-Men 3 and Wolverine, not that it matters too much however.<br/><br/>The cast all do okay. I was afraid that it was going to descend into a teen flick with all the mutant kiddies, but it managed to steer away from that.<br/><br/>Kevin Bacon stars as the antagonist, but he's largely useless (apart from inexplicably going from a German accent to an American accent) and somehow becoming a super-mutant.<br/><br/>Overall the script was okay, but lacked a certain something. It's hard to put my finger on it, but it just seemed a bit light and a bit shallow. The mutant powers were all a bit weak on the goodies' side, whilst the baddies had the cool stuff.<br/><br/>Overall, 7 out of 10."

The fact Cerebro was ALL of the sudden there made by Xavier and not together with Magneto. Sudden characters shouldn't even BE there as of yet which screws up the time frame.

","So I saw all of the initial reviews and ratings about this film and was psyched to see it. Some people were saying it gave ""The Dark Knight"" competition for best comic book adapted film of all time. Are you kidding me? This film was just like every other X-Men movie made. There was nothing new or unique about this one. I have to admit that the film had some great potential and throughout the film I was sitting on the edge of my seat waiting for the film to make a turn for greatness. It never came. The actors did a good job, but some of the screenplay was so flat that it took away from the film. <br/><br/>The difference between a film like ""The Dark Knight"" and ""First Class"" is that ""The Dark Knight"" brings a serious, dark, and realistic tone while ""First Class"" continues the same trend X-Men have always been on. There is nothing magical about this film. There were some great scenes and cameo appearances, but overall this movie let me down tremendously. I was expecting so much more from a film that got 87% from RottenTomatoes. Is everyone joking? Do not have high hopes for this one.<br/><br/>6/10"
"AlienatorX","2","2","5","4 April 2016"," I don't understand what all the fuss is about
","Are we watching two different movies everyone? I have heard nothing but praise for this movie. Over and over again people crying that the X-Men movies are finally returning to their former glory (I think the MCU might have given them a bit of inspiration personally) and I've even seen this film on more then one list of best superhero films ever. Butit's really not that good guys. Now I know what people like about this film; the relationship between Xavier and Magneto. I agree it's well done; how they help to shape each other, how they get on so well, how they have similar goals and all that sort of thing. They really do work well together but their relationship is not enough to save this movie. Firstly the period setting is nothing short of pathetic; I've seen period Superhero movie (The Shadow, Captain America: First Avenger) and this movie doesn't hold a candle to them. If you didn't tell me it was set in the sixties I wouldn't have guessed because the move does such a poor job of convincing you that it's set in another time period. The villain in this movie is painfully weak and coming from a series that has brought us one of the greatest villains ever in Magneto having a villain this uninteresting is nothing short of criminal. In fact except for Magneto and Xavier all the characters in this movie are plenty bland. I'm also not a fan of the CGI in this movie; it seems to cover nearly everything in the film in this sheen that makes it look plastic. The racism thing manages to be even more ridiculous in this movie too; highlighted by one scene where a Russian ship and an American ship (literally seconds after the Cuban missile crisis) put aside their differences and turn their weapons on the mutants. That's just small child writing superhero comics level of stupid. Also am I the only one disturbed that every woman in this movie is portrayed in a sexual way? Every single main female character in this movie is in a sexual position at least once in the film. I can't be the only one that finds this troubling. On a minor note do you know who that red demonic looking mutant is? The one who's the main villain's sidekick? The one who can teleport? His name is Azazel. In the comics he's the last member of an ancient subspecies of mutants who created the human idea of the demon (he's also the father of Nightcrawler with Mystique but that something else entirely). Azazel is actually a villain in his own right and having him being a toady to a weak villain like this is nothing short of criminal; this is made even worse when you learn he was played by a British actor, not just any British actor but Jason Flemyng. This is such a waist I could cry. Overall Xavier and Magneto and great, five stars for them alone but the rest of the movie doesn't match up."

In first class we explore the origins of the x-men, and we witness the beginning of the relationship of Professor X and Magneto. <br/><br/>X men first-class had a great story, in which they borrowed real events and added mutants! IT was awesome, first class also makes us love the characters since we see how they develop and how they choose their actions, we also witness how Charles Xavier wants them to fit in. First class was beautifully directed, Matthew Vaughn did a brilliant job, we really got the 60's feel, the props, the camera angles, the planes the weapons the setting EVERYTHING gives the viewer the 60's feel. The casting was OK,i mean James McCavoy, Michael Fassbender and Kevin Bacon were all great but I didn't like January Jones as Emma Frost. The screenplay was amazing it was filled with great quotes! One thing I was disappointed about in First Class was the character development of Magneto...it seemed like he turned evil overnight.<br/><br/>Another thing was the choice of the X men to be in the film, I would have loved to see cyclops and storm since they were Xavier's first students, but Marc Waid made it work and at least we got to see Havock (cyclops's brother) <br/><br/>OverallFirst class was a great film and definitely the best Marvel film out there i give it a 7.8/10"

Xmen and X2 were OK, but with the third movie, everything just went downhill, and I lost my hope in superhero..... until TDK appeared in 2008.

","A long-time collector of comic books, my expectations were high when Bryan Singer's 'X-Men' came out. Happily, my expectations were met and I enjoyed the movie. Singer's 'X2: X-Men United' blew me away, taking superhero films to a new level. Singer then left to make the disappointing 'Superman Returns"", leaving Brett Ratner ('Rush Hour"" trilogy) to direct the extremely disappointing 'X-Men: The Last Stand', which was followed by Gavin Hood's ('Rendition') 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine'; which was also a letdown. After 10 years and 4 movies, the X-Men franchise had run its course. To usher in a new era, Bryan Singer was brought in as a producer and Matthew Vaughn ('Kick-Ass') as director of 'X-Men: First Class'. There was belief that a prequel movie was the way to go; and the script put together was first class, like it's title.<br/><br/>'X-Men: First Class"" is the story of two boys, who become men, and the moments in their lives that defined them. Erik Lensherr (Bill Milner, Michael Fassbender), grows up in war torn, Nazi occupied Poland. Torn from his parents and then being used as a test subject due to his ability to control metal, by the diabolical Dr. Schmidt (Kevin Bacon), Erik spends much of his young adult life trying to find and get revenge on the evil Doctor. Simultaneously in Westchester, NY, Charles Xavier (Laurence Belcher/James McAvoy) discovers a girl, a shape-shifter disguised as his mother, in his kitchen searching for food. As Charles grows, along with his adopted sister, the shape-shifter named Raven, he graduates from Oxford University as an expert in Genetic Studies. The CIA, thanks to Moira Mactaggert (Rose Byrne) recruits Charles to help in capturing the terrorist organization known as the Hellfire Club; Emma Frost (January Jones), Riptide (Álex González), and Azazel (Jason Flemyng), led by Sebastian Shawn formerly Dr. Schmidt (Kevin Bacon). As the CIA and Erik converge on Shaw/Schmidt, Charles saves Erik. As their friendship grows, they are organized with putting together a team to track down the Hellfire Club. Along with scientist, and fellow mutant Hank McCoy's (Nicholas Hoult) creation Cerebro, Charles is able to locate and enlist a team of young mutants, along with Raven to help their cause. Joining them in the fight is: Angel (Zoë Kravitz), Banshee (Caleb Landry Jones), Darwin (Edi Gathegi) and Havoc (Lucas Till). Things escalate as the team must work together to not only stop Shaw and the Hellfire Club and save the world from a nuclear war but show that although they are different, they are still human.<br/><br/>'X-Men: First Class' is about revenge, war, and prejudice. Although the movie is about super powered individuals, it's predominantly story driven. There's action, but not loud, intolerable explosions or gunshots we've grown accustomed to in summer movies. There's CGI, but it's done within the story and doesn't feel like it's overwhelming. The ensemble cast wasn't full of A-list actors, but the casting was solid and each performance was memorable. Kevin Bacon's Dr. Schmidt/Sebastian Shaw was campy, but not overdone and January Jones' Emma Frost is absolutely stunning. The relationship between Xavier and Raven was convincingly genuine. Michael Fassbender made Erik/Magneto a very conflicted character, and made the role his own. Overall, 'X-Men: First Class' graduates with the highest of honors, and a Masters degree in entertainment.<br/><br/>Summer movie Grade: A+ (My favorite movie of the summer so far!) Age Appropriate meter: 10+ (not much entertainment for younger children)<br/><br/>visit our site at www.twodudreview.com"
"ramharshvardhan","10","2","5","29 July 2011"," The best X - Men movie ..... Absolutely Brilliant !!!
","This might not be the best movie of 2011 but it sure is the best X- Men movie of all time and surpasses the last four movies.<br/><br/>Every scene is crafted with dedication and the end says it all. The screenplay deserves a special mention here which is very tight and there are no loose ends. Most of the scenes are interconnected with some or the other which keeps the watching delicious and joyful. For example, the starting scene where Shaw kills Eric's mother and hands over the coin to him and the ending scene where Shaw is killed using the same coin is great synchronization.<br/><br/>Fassbender has done great justice to the role of Magneto and the name suits him better. He is on par with McAvoy in terms of performance and the two share a great chemistry. I loved Fassbender in this film, especially in the ending scenes. All other mutants are passable and good.<br/><br/>Overall, this great film should not be missed by people who like well-crafted movies and its a great fun to watch with a bunch of popcorn. Especially with a genre like this, its a must-go !!!"
"Maleplatypus","Null","2","5","18 July 2011"," A very, very good movie
","When I don't press FFD button while watching, the movie must be good. When I don't pause the movie while watching, for whatever reason, it must be very good. When I recommend it, it must be excellent. This one I recommend. Perfect casting, music, camera, editing, directing, acting, you name it. It is not simple to ""swim"" within the boundaries of a (so to speak) fairy tale (or fiction) and yet remain entertaining and not insulting viewers' intelligence. This movie has it all worth watching more than once. Every bit of it radiates the enthusiasm of the people involved. It provokes emotions. Definitely stands out in ordinary movie industry production. Take your time and watch it. Spend some quality time with yourself/friends. And, of course, have fun as I did."
"devayanghosh87","9","2","5","16 July 2011"," The X Factor
","Well to begin with I am a huge fan of X-Men comic series and i know it is a mammoth task to bring these characters and to put them in a movie which does justice to all the characters.The previous Xmen trilogy was successful in building a story for the series but didn't do justice to a lot of characters apart from the big bosses.The latest installment of the movie is not quite true to the comic book or the original Xmen storyline but it sure does justice to the moviegoers.Matthew Vaughan being the great director he is has done an excellent job of weaving such a great story and bringing together a sterling star cast.James Mcavoy and Micheal Fassbender do justice to Professor X and Magneto' character respectively and Kevin Bacon is diabolical as Sebastian Shaw. My verdict:Great movie,must watch for Xmen fans as well as those who are familiar with the franchise."
"leonguyen_fuhimatsu","8","2","5","10 July 2011"," The best of the sequel!
","The film, overall, is a really good film for its genre. The story, music, visual effects,... are all acceptable in accordance with entertaining films. But there are some mistakes that hinder the film from becoming a big success.<br/><br/>1. The acting is so poor, especially James McAvoy. His performance couldn't transfer the image of a pacifist professor to me; he gave me an impression as foolish, weak person. After this film, I just think that Xavier is wrong, it is Magneto who is the right one. I can't even feel his must-be-very-painful injury when he is shot. This character compared to the old Xavier, seems to have no link, no at all... a very bad performance. Lucas Till's(Havok) performance is transparently the worst. And some other young actors though not bad but obviously not as good as the actors appearing in the first 4 films. To make up for that, Michael Fassbender (Magneto)and Jennifer Lawrence (Mystique) are rather good in this film. Mystique is probably the most thought-provoking protagonist in the film. The director has done a really good job in developing Mystique's emotion, opinion and the relationship between her, Magneto and Beast, which is the most beautiful thing in the film.<br/><br/>2. Some scenes are not persuasive and quite ridiculous especially the one when the mutant ask each other to ""show"" their abilities and the training part, which are all so childish.<br/><br/>3. The action scene in the end of the film is obviously the highlight of the film, the most anticipated scene. But it is too short, probably only 15 minutes-long compared to the 130-minute length of the film. The scene has not been pushed to the limit, remains a bit disappointing and lack actions.<br/><br/>In conclusion, despite some limitations, it is still a very enthralling action-hero movie, which is surprisingly meaningful. It doesn't simply talk about the discrimination against the mutant, the film encourages the minority of the society, who are somehow unlucky, like the disabled, gay ... to break the stigma and integrate with the society. Through this film, and thanks to Michael Fassbender's standing-out good performance, I no longer feel hatred to Magneto and his partisans (especially Mystique). He, in some ways, is right; he has suffered much and now he has the right to retaliate. Human being are just too arrogant and selfish to accept the fact that some other more revolutionalized being can defeat us, the human being. We can kill the animals to extinction; put prices on land, soil; destroy the environment... so there is no reason why the mutant cannnot kill us. This fact definitely makes us think a lot, look back ourselves and you will figure out many things.<br/><br/>In the end, you are sure to have a really good time watching this film. You won't feel regret for the money you purchase for the ticket. <br/><br/>X-Men: First Class is definitely the best among the X-Men films to date!"
"Paranoyia","9","2","5","8 July 2011"," Simply awesome. The best in series or a fantastic reboot?!
","""X2"" was up until this one the greatest. I am not sure if ""The First Class"" is a reboot or not, but it sure better be. James McAvoy as Xavier and Michael Fassbender as Magneto are both a delight to see. Also their scope is far above that of the ones in the previous X movies. Yes, Ian McKellen was magnificent as Magneto as well, very intimidating too. Yet Patrick Stewart as Charles Xavier were actually pretty weak (because he's more of a TV actor mostly and it shows), not to mention every bit of his acting was screaming ""Picard!"" at you. As the rivaling duo they just didn't work well, because of Jean-Luc, I mean Patrick... McAvoy- Fassbender interplay is far better, thusly.<br/><br/>There were significantly less characters this time around, but all of them were a lot better developed and used appropriately, as much in action scenes as in social ones. When will Hollywood learn that less is actually more when it comes to most things, especially movies where every minute counts for something? Take notes, you amateurs of Hollywood, praised or otherwise, this is how you do it right. Matthew Vaughn (first ""Kick-Ass"", now this) is from now on in my top three favorite directors, alongside Edgar Wright (I know I riffed on ""Scott Pilgrim"", but it was due to a bad company I had whilst watching it, loved it after rewatching, still think the Zelda references were stupid though) and Chris Nolan (""Memento"", ""Dark Knight"", ""Inception"", need I say more?).<br/><br/>I have a minor critique though. I spotted a tiny hole in a dialogue script: Erik said he thought he was alone in his powers, yet he witnessed Emma Frost in her full glory a few scenes before. I might spot some more if I watch one more time, but surely it's just a tiny remark, not even worth mentioning that much. The biggest complaint I have is that the final battle with Sebastian Shaw, which was a pretty cool and devious villain in my opinion (played by the terrific Kevin Bacon), was very anticlimactic (but not the ending to the whole movie). Surely a great mutant villain with such a cool power as Shaw should have been entitled for more.<br/><br/>As for the rest of this film. Watch it, watch it in a theater. With all the garbage Hollywood is spewing lately this one definitely stands out. Even if that weren't the case ""The First Class"" is a superb movie in its own right."
"moviejunkie123","10","2","5","7 July 2011"," One of the best movies this year! Much more than I expected!!
","Just watched this movie last Tuesday.I know I was sorta late as it has been on for about a month already. But i was waiting for my friend who just finished exams. Anyway, back the the point. This movie gave me so much more than i expected! I am so excited and grateful that I got the chance to see this movie in the cinema!!! To be honest, I didn't feel like to watch it straight away when I saw the trailer in the first place. Maybe its because of the actor who plays Charles. (Im not saying he is not good at all.In fact, he is AMAZING!). According to all the XMen movies i've seen so far, the main character (Wolverine) is always strong and powerful with those muscles. That brings me this impression：when we talk about XMen movies, it has to be manful with those actions in it. but apparently, the main actor in this movie is totally different, well at least James doesn't look like as that strong as Hugh Jackman. so when i saw the trailer, i was like: what? this the main the character? hmm, seems not much like what I have in my mind as usual. But James didn't disappoint me at all! He gave me another concept of XMen series. In this movie, Charles is such a gentleman and he is kind to everyone, even to the bad guys, He accepts all the mutants and has always tried to lead them to the right way. However, he is also strong inside.when he faced the coin crossing through his head (physically its Shaw's head but its Charles's mind), he didn't give away, he still held it until the very last minute. we can imagine how much pain he had to suffer at that time(both physically and emotionally),he was seeing it happening and sorta let it happen right in front of his face, and all the reason is Erik! his best friend. I think at that time, he felt not only the pain on the body, but also the pain that Erik betrayed his trust.Thanks to James, he really did a fantastic job there. Michael and James had a couple of fabulous scenes together for sure. The end of the movie is so touching and powerful. I nearly cried when i saw Charles telling Erik they do not want the same thing in tears. I was simply moved by him. Overall, I would definitely recommond this movie to anyone who likes to enjoy the real good movies (Not those only rely on 3D or technical stuff). This movie has the great story line which makes a lot of sense and both of the main actors(James and Michael) really have brought their characters alive. Love Love this movie!!"
"steven-marshall99","10","2","5","5 July 2011"," The best of the X-Men Franchise
","I was very sceptical about this film, I thought all the prior X-Men movies were a bit too grounded and never quite hit the heights of an epic summer action blockbuster e.g. the Dark Knight, Spider-man 2 etc so when I first viewed the trailer for this film I thought oh great more of the same. But after seeing the second trailer I was a little more open to it, the positive reviews helped as well then I saw it and I was blown away. While not perfect it does something better than all the prior X-Men movies it delivers on every level. Whilst not as good as the Dark Knight or Richard Donner's Superman it comes darn close, I'd put it alongside Batman Begins as it has potential to be even bigger in a sequel. It has it all epic action scenes, fantastic performances and a story that flows superbly. I absolutely loved this film and cannot wait for a sequel; 10 out of 10."
"QueerVamp20","Null","2","5","5 July 2011"," Not what I expected - But Awesome!!!
","X-Men First Class is basically part of the story of how charles xavier and magneto became who they were in the previous trilogy. Now, I am not a comic book reader, but I love the movies.<br/><br/>The story: A young Charles Xavier begins a friendship with a mutant everyone knows (Mystique) - As time goes by - more mutant friends are made but new enemies are beginning war - But as the mutants are fighting against the villains - the human race become a threat too - but who are they a threat to? Is everyone against everyone? <br/><br/>In this movie you get to learn how some mutants got their names and how war began between mutants and humans. The mutants in this movie are awesome and original. They have some very interesting abilities, especially the villains. There is a decent amount of action, however I would've liked to have seen more - The acting is decent but not great. I feel as though Kevin Bacon's role could've been better - I have seen him do better. The ending seemed a bit rushed, however, this movie left possibility for a new and even more interesting X-Men franchise."
"jenngrayxx","10","2","5","4 July 2011"," Best of all X-Men combined
","I cannot believe I waited a month to see this film. It's a terrific story set against a nicely-woven time period where you can understand and empathize with the world's fear, panic, and with all of the characters....all of them. <br/><br/>All of the funny comments, cameos, names of ""senior"" characters, all were noticed. This is definitely my favorite of the entire franchise. It's hard to say who stole the show (Michael Fassbender) because all of the major performances were so well done. <br/><br/>The relationship between Magneto & Charles is the reason I enjoyed the first X-Men so much, and I loved seeing this from the beginning. Fassbender very astutely captures the pain and anger of Magneto and I couldn't take my eyes off of him."
"ollie1939-97-957994","9","2","5","4 July 2011"," The Best of the Series!!!!
","This is by far my favorite of the X Men movies. This is the most interesting of all the series and probably my favorite superhero movie based off any Marvel comic book. I never read the comics so my only experience with the X Men were the movies. Apart from X men 2 which I thought was a fun movie, all the previous X Men movies were average summer blockbusters. This one is far better than all of them mostly because of the cast.<br/><br/>James McAvoy and Michael Fassebender do the best performances in the film as Professor Xavier and Magneto. Fassebender in particular does a good job as he has to show himself as a tortured soul who will later become the main villain of the Xmen series. The other actor also do a good job like Kevin Bacon as the mad Sebastion Shaw. Hugh Jackman also has a great cameo as Wolverine. The only bad performance I could think of was January Jones as Emma Frost as her performance is pretty wooden. Otherwise this is the best film to come out of this summer so far and one of the best superhero films ever."
"hoang_hai_linh97","10","2","5","3 July 2011"," This movie is beyond my imagination
","This is the first X-Men movie I have ever seen and to be honest, I didn't have much expectation. Additionally, I sat in row B, which was unbelievably close to the screen. In spite of the fact that my neck hurt so much after walking out of the cinema, I have had a marvellous experience with X-Men: First Class.<br/><br/>It is amazing. Just genius. I feel so thankful that human is given the ability to imagine. And what I have seen is far beyond anything I can ever imagine in my head. I admit that apart from the Harry Potter series and Avatar, I hardly ever take any fiction movie (the kind of movie where people have super power, they come from future, they have super weapon, they come from another planet blah blah blah...) in a serious way. And this completely changed my mind.<br/><br/>The plot, well, maybe still has some holes. But the acting is wonderful, especially the 2 lead actors. Kevin Bacon is a great great great villain. Michael Fassbender plays the role of Erik very believable. And James McAvoy (professor X)? he is simply so wonderful in every aspects. The effect is superb and the music is just incredible. This movie will surely make you WOW with its coolness.<br/><br/>Really, the best movie of this year until now : )"
"velkots","9","2","5","1 July 2011"," A fantastic movie
","This movie was fantastic. I absolutely loved the actors they chose for Xavier and Charles and Mystique and their performances were great! I did think that a few of the mutants were kind of silly and far-fetched, like the butterfly girl. However, most of the mutants seemed to be very consistent and well written. It was interesting to see the story of the two main mutants and learn about how their world was before the start of the x-men series. I'm hoping they make more x-men movies to boot! There are so many more plots they can explore, a major one being Apocalypse. All in all I give this movie a 9 / 10. It does have some flaws...Like one inconsistency with the previously released Wolverine movie where at the end of the wolverine movie he is walking, but in this movie, where he's younger, he's already lost the ability to walk."
"aadc1","Null","2","5","29 June 2011"," Stands out from standard comic screen adaptations.
","The filming style is mainly in short sequences.

Written in ( ) you see the most suitable movie of the actor. And a new discovery (for me): Michael Fassbender (very cold acting, which I love, and also very language skilled).<br/><br/>The story makes sense and shows how everything began (Once more this has become a standard in the filming business. I think Star Wars Episode I, 1999, started this mania.)<br/><br/>Normally comic adaptations are boring, childish and for fans only.

","X First Class was incredible, the plot was amazing and you really understood a lot that you didn't in the original 3 X-Men movies. I admit I was both excited and very nervous about watching this film, because I had so much expectations for this movie and they want above them. James McAvoy is perfect for the role of a young Charles Xavier. I was actually impressed with every actor/actress chosen for their roles. I saw all of them as who they were supposed to be. Jennifer Lawrence also blew me away as the role of Mystique. I had never seen her act before this movie, but was glad they picked her. Words can not explain how well Michael Fassbender makes us relate to Magneto in a way that we can understand all of his actions and even want to be on his side. I just think this movie was everything good. To any X-Men fan, you must see this movie. You will thoroughly enjoy it."
"FlashCallahan","9","2","5","26 June 2011"," Don't touch my hair.....
","Before Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr took the names Professor X and Magneto, they were two young men discovering their powers for the first time.<br/><br/>Before they were archenemies, they were closest of friends, working together, with other Mutants (some familiar, some new), to stop the greatest threat the world has ever known.<br/><br/>In the process, a rift between them opened, which began the eternal war.....<br/><br/>Strangely enough, one of the most under-hyped summer movies this year, turns out to be one of the best Marvel Adaptions made. Thor and Captain America have the biggest pull this year, Because of the avengers, bu this is a classy film, proving that Vaughn is one cool director, and a great storyteller.<br/><br/>He has got one of he best casts of the year, and managed to get a great performance from everyone of them. McAvoy and Fassbender are simply wonderful as X and Magneto, and kudos to them for not copying their older counterparts ala Ewan Macgregor in the Star Wars prequels.<br/><br/>But the best thing about this is Kevin Bacon, and his sinister verging on the edge of brilliance/highly camp Shaw. He steals every scene he is, and exudes evil as much as he consumes energy.<br/><br/>But as always, with films with a lot of characters, a lot get lost in the fray. Jones is lost, and just spends the time looking pretty, The guy who can make wind doesn't even spout a line, and Flemying should have been used more.<br/><br/>The set pieces here are spectacular, and surprisingly very tense. The attack with Erik and the anchor is exciting with great editing and use of effects, and the attack by Azazel dropping the 'men in black' from the sky has to be one of the set pieces of the year up to now.<br/><br/>It's not just an event movie, this has to be the best X-men film made up to now, and thats down to Vaughn and Goldman thinking beyond the effects and giving us a great story, references to the fates of the X-men, characters to care for, and a narrative that is easy to follow.<br/><br/>And plus we have one of the best cameos of the year.<br/><br/>So all in all, it's not just a great summer movie, it's probably one of the best films released this year."

","Well i'm not a fan of the X-Men series, but the concept of being fan in itself is quite stupid.

I mean, that's the kind of movie i'm prepared to watch when having a bad time in the toilet, and the Turkish one, or when having a hangover, which is basically what this movie makes you feel.<br/><br/>I wonder how soon the IMDb ratings will become relevant again. Perhaps the day people learn to evolve from computer to intelligent human beings. The binary ratings are a pain in the ass. And probably in part a result of some sound commercial tricks (when will CAPTCHAs will be introduced?). Just look at the ratings of the bottom 100 ""Dream Well"", and you'll probably come to the same conclusion as mine."
"estebangonzalez10","8","2","5","17 June 2011"," It's all about Michael Fassbender and James McAvoy
","¨We have it in us to be the better man.¨ I will be honest with you guys: I didn't think this movie would work without Wolverine, after all he was the heart and soul of the previous X-Men films. Hugh Jackman was the reason why I had enjoyed the other movies so much and I thought this film would suffer without this main character (it would be like a Pirates of the Caribbean movie without Jack Sparrow). I was wrong! X-Men: First Class works really well as a prequel/reboot to the franchise for one main reason: The casting of Michael Fassbender and James McAvoy as the two lead characters: friends turned archenemies Magneto and Professor X. The relationship between these two characters and the two outstanding performances these talented actors give are what make X-Men: First Class the best superhero film since The Dark Knight. I know we have been bombarded with superhero films lately, and they are actually all pretty decent thanks to the strong background and depth these characters have been given in the comics, but this one is really worth your time. I loved the direction that Matthew Vaughn (Kick-Ass, Stardust, and Snatch) took with this film by letting the center of the plot revolve around the relationship between Erik Lehnsherr (Magneto) and Charles Xavier (Professor X). We really come to care for these two friends who we know will become enemies in the future, but can't help but root for them to get along in some way. Fassbender and McAvoy really deliver outstanding leading performances and the scenes between them are the heart of the movie. X-Men fans won't be disappointed.<br/><br/>The movie begins during World War II as the Nazis are trying to separate young Erik from his parents. While they are taken away Erik begins to bend the metal fences with his mind until a soldier knocks him out. One of the Nazi officials named Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) questions Erik before killing his mother in front of him since he is unable to move a metal coin. Later Sebastian discovers that Erik's powers only work when he is angry and therefore begins to train his prisoner. The movie then jumps to the present: it is 1962 and the world is at verge of another World War. Tension between the United States and Russia is high; the Cold War is at its boiling point. Sebastian is trying to take advantage of the situation and wants a nuclear war to begin. By his side he has some mutant friends: Emma Frost (January Jones) and Azazel (Jason Flemyng). On the meantime Erik Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender) is after Sebastian and wants revenge. Erik isn't the only one after Shaw, an FBI agent, named Moira (Rose Byrne) discovers that he is trying to start a nuclear war and sees the mutants therefore she decides to investigate and discovers that a young student has done some extensive research on human mutation, his name is Charles Xavier (James McAvoy). Charles knows that there are many mutants with special powers like his in the world. He even adopted one and began to teach her how to deal with her power: Raven (Jennifer Lawrence), alias Mystique. Charles begins working with Moira in order to stop Shaw. He also befriends Erik and together they begin to round up other young mutants with special powers: Angel (Zoe Kravitz), Havok (Lucas Till), Hank McCoy (Nicholas Hoult), Banshee (Caleb Jones), and Darwin (Edi Gathegi).<br/><br/>It was very interesting to see how the X-Men story began. The scenes where Erik and Charles teach the young mutants how to deal with their powers and master them remind us that these two guys are in a way very similar to each other. They both have great respect for one another; they are both excellent teachers and want to help their fellow mutants, but Erik never was able to deal with the pain of losing his parents and has grown resentful towards humans. This is what separates the two: one is motivated by hate, the other by grace. The same happens with the young mutants and there is no denying the fact that some will go along Erik's path, while others will follow Charles's. We all know that Magneto's brotherhood will be in constant battle with Professor Xavier's X-Men, but what we didn't know (at least film wise) was how the two groups went their separate ways. It is this friendship between the two main characters that we know will end, what builds the tension for a very satisfying finale. On a side note I really didn't care for the rest of the mutants. They were just that: secondary characters. What made the movie work entirely were these great scenes between McAvoy and Fassbender. The rest was just unremarkable in my opinion. Jennifer Lawrence and Kevin Bacon gave good performances, but the truth is that the movie really revolved around Erick and Charles, and these two actors did a great job to make up for a somewhat mediocre script. I really enjoyed this reboot/prequel and it has taken the franchise to a whole new level.<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"

"LloydBayer","8","2","5","17 June 2011"," X Men :First Class ushers in the 2011 summer action mania.
","Every year, a highly anticipated movie officially launches the summer action fiesta. For 2011, this is it! Look no further, X-men: First Class has thrown the gates openwide open.<br/><br/>In almost unaltered history, the film dates back to the early 1960s era of suspense and dread. John F Kennedy is the president of the United States of America and the whole world braces for what is sure to be nuclear Armageddon. If you are thinking 'Cuban Missile Crisis', then I have your attention. However, before the world got to this predicament, we need to go back to the European theatre of World War II. In a concentration camp at Auschwitz, Occupied Poland, young Erik Lehnsherr witnesses his mother's brutal murder. During this traumatic event and fuelled by anger, Erik unleashes his secret power-much to the amazement of the perpetrator, Doctor Sebastian Shaw. Across the Atlantic, a young Charles Xavier discovers powers of his own. Before long, Xavier is a distinguished academic living with the shape-shifting Raven (who would later renegade and be called Mystique). Dedicating his life to avenging his mother's death, Erik Lehnsherr bumps into Charles Xavier, spawning an instant friendship and powerful bond. Together, and with their mutant friends, they are the CIA's last hope in averting a nuclear crisis that culminates into a spectacular face-off between American and Soviet naval forces.<br/><br/>With all due respect, Mathew Vaughn does a phenomenal job as the director of this prequel. But fans of the Marvel comic book and the X-Men franchise will always look back to Bryan Singer for giving us the first two titles: X-Men (2000) and X2: X-Men United (2003). In fact, this installment is almost entirely the handy work of Singer, who not only co-wrote the script, but also produced the film. What he did not do was direct the movie, and that was a last moment decision due to pre-committed schedules for filming Jack the Giant Killer. So, having received the raw materials on a silver platter, all Vaughn had to do was execute it, take for take. In doing so, Vaughn has successfully re-vamped the X-Men franchise with such grandeur, a spin-off trilogy has already found its way to the drawing boards. On the whole, everything works here; from a captivating and intelligent screenplay to exceptional character development to fantastic action sequences. Whether you are a Marvel comic-book fan, X-Men movie fan or an action movie junkie, right from the start, through the 130 minutes to the end, you are sure to be entertained. Visuals are top notch, oozing CGI in many scenes. And to think, Vaughn has pulled this off without the need of those cumbersome 3D Spectacles. <br/><br/>As a prequel, the script is pure ingenuity and takes us back to a time before Erik and Charles became the archenemies we know them to be. It is also a time when mutants are discovering and practicing their powers in secret. Aside from the mutant origins, embedded in the script is a parallel history relating to the Cuban Missile Crisis and birth of the Civil Rights Movement. The ingenuity of this is grafting history with fiction and having the audience accept its plausibility without having to state it as based on actual events. Forrest Gump was the first film to have pulled that off. First Class builds on this concept in such a clever way, that the script is studded with historical events. Another aspect of the screenplay also brings to mind a distinct James Bond theme. Maybe it is just the opinion of this reviewer, but chronologically, Bond's cinematic debut (1960s) is around the same time frame scripted for this movie. It is left to be seen if Vaughn intended for this as a mild undertone. <br/><br/>Onto star performance, and most notable for his role as the young doctor in The last King of Scotland, James McAvoy is nothing like the Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) we have seen before. McAvoy's Xavier is drastically different, egotistical, brash, and a flirt on the loose. On the other hand, Michael Fassbender dons Sir Ian McKellan's suit as Erik Lehnsherr. Like McAvoy, he too ""paints a fresh canvas"" for the character who would go on to become the ruthless 'Magneto'. Although McAvoy and Fassbender are perfectly cast, I have to say the latter has the edge in terms of drawing you in. In doing so, he never steps on McKellan's toes, but brings out an unseen side of Erik Lehnsherr. When I mentioned James Bond earlier, I was referring to Fassbender; for some reason, his character carries a distinctive MI-6 persona. Another worthy mention should go to Kevin Bacon as the villainous Shaw. I don't want to spoil the surprise, but Bacon's Shaw plays a key role in bringing the world to the brink of war. For the time period portrayed, Kevin Bacon is the only actor whose character dons an accent. In doing so, he almost gets his German and Russian accents to a believable level. Perhaps, Vaughn did not feel the actors needed to work on their accent and that could be why none of the other actors actually bothered with an accent suiting the setting. Aside from McAvoy, Fassbender and Bacon, watch out for a plethora of good contributions from January Jones, Jennifer Lawrence, Zoë kravitz and loads more as newly discovered mutants along with cameos from Oliver Plat, Michael Ironside and you guessed it, Hugh Jackman. <br/><br/>For a summer opener, X-Men: First Class does not disappoint. As a prequel, it pushes boundaries, raises the bar and broadens the scope of expanding this franchise. At a time when all we see are sequels and 3D gimmicks, this film is a surefire summer winner. If you have been following the series, you will love First Class. If you haven't, don't worry, Vaughn and Singer have successfully re-booted a dying franchise; there will be more to come."

"ced_yuen","Null","2","5","16 June 2011"," 'First Class' is to X-Men what 'Casino Royale' was to James Bond - rejuvenation
","'X-Men' has been saved. It never quite reached the painful lows of the 'Batman' franchise under the misdirection of Joel Schumacher, but after the last two distinctly average outings, the franchise faced an uncertain future. Not anymore: X-Men has been restored to its former glory. 'X-Men: First Class' is to X-Men what 'Casino Royale' was to James Bond - rejuvenation.<br/><br/>The film occupies the perfect spot between fan service and accessibility. There are things that long-time X-Men fans will recognise and appreciate, and for them these geek snippets will enhance the overall experience. However, these references are never laboured. Blink and you'll miss them. Newcomers never feel as though they are outsiders - this is the perfect jumping-on point.<br/><br/>Forget 2009's 'Wolverine' – this should have been called 'X-Men Origins', because that's exactly what it is. It is about a young Charles Xavier and his fascination with human evolution. It is about young Erik Lehnsherr and his desire to avenge the death of his family in the Holocaust. This is the story of how they become Professor X and Magneto.<br/><br/>It's not about super powers. There are a lot of them, but that's not the point of the film. The focus is primarily on the characters. They're not superheroes and supervillians just yet, they're just people, trying to deal with mutations – which is far more interesting than explosions and fights.<br/><br/>The mutants have differing attitudes towards their 'gifts'. Some are proud while others are ashamed. There is a sense that these mutations really affect the lives of some characters. Mystique, seen in previous films as a sassy and confident shape-shifter, is revealed to be sensitive and highly insecure. The mutants are much less one-dimensional and, as a result, more real.<br/><br/>The depth of these characters is complimented by the outstanding acting. Michael Fassbender is sublime. There have been comments about his Bond-like performance and while this is true, it is a gross oversimplification of his character. He perfectly straddles the line between good and evil, between rage and serenity. His performance has such depth that it is easier to empathise with him than to condemn him for his crimes.<br/><br/>Look past his bitterness and violence, and it is possible to see a confused, tortured soul simultaneously seeking peace and vengeance. Fassbender's Magneto is an interesting character, so impressively portrayed that it actually makes Ian McKellen seem dull by comparison.<br/><br/>James McAvoy does a great job as a naïve, arrogant version of Charles Xavier. His character is not as interesting as Fassbender's, but that has more to do with Matthew Vaughn's decision to focus on Magneto's development. Nonetheless, McAvoy and Fassbender have great chemistry, resulting in a double-act reminiscent of 'Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid'.<br/><br/>Their performances are strong enough to cover up the weaker acting, most notably from January Jones, who is wooden and vacant. She relies greatly on her revealing costumes, but they fail to distract from the fact that she blinks more than she acts.<br/><br/>With a well-written story and impressive lead acting, 'First Class' is an excellent film in its own right. However, it is praiseworthy that Matthew Vaughn has managed to make a film of this quality that also ties in with the pre-existing films. The X-Men franchise could end here, with this instalment as a perfect background for Bryan Singer's 'future' efforts.<br/><br/>Alternatively it could carry on, and, judging by the strength of this one, nobody would complain. Very rarely does a follow-up challenge its predecessors in terms of quality or intrigue, but 'First Class' is such a film. In fact, it may be the best 'X-Men' yet."
"jmcginn174","9","2","5","16 June 2011"," New X-MEN better than the Old.
","Like many people was hesitant about a new X-Men movie that was part prequel part reboot. I have a fondness toward the first three X-Men movies. And Unlike many people out there I really enjoyed X-MEN 3 and think it is a really underrated movie. Sure Brett Ratner's directing wasn't great but the story was good and so was the action. I also love how they weren't afraid to kill off the main characters. My biggest problem with the movie was the over abundance of characters the threw into the movie. I know it sounds like I'm giving a review for X-Men: The Last Stand but I wanted to make it clear I really like the previous films and wasn't sure about a reboot/prequel just like I'm nervous about the new Spiderman movie. Though after seeing this movie I view it more as a prequel.<br/><br/>Now I was wrong X-MEN: First Class is a great movie and will probably be the best comic book movie of the summer. With the already underwhelming THOR. THE GREEN LANTERN which in all honesty doesn't look that good and CAPTAIN America which I really hope is good.<br/><br/>One of the first things I need to talk about is the actors and many people may not recognize or remember. First Kevin Bacon who hasn't been in a lot of movies recently steals the movie as Sebastian Shaw as he brings such live and zeal to the character and I'm disappointed he won't be around for the enviable sequels. Then there's James McAvoy who hasn't done anything recognizable outside of Wanted. He plays Charles Xavior who I will always remember as Patrick Steward. He was the perfect Professor X. Still McAvoy did a good job as a you Xavior. Michael Fassbender as Magneto I had never heard of and again I had a fondness for the excellent actor Ian McKellen. I thought Michael did a excellent job as a young tortured Magneto and he even looks like a young Mckellen. Next I need to give a shout out to the movie great movie SUNSHINE and the actress Rose Byrne(Moira MacTaggert) who has been in many good movies and is a great actress. Then there are two supporting characters who I don't think had any lines but were great. The two are Riptide(Álex González) and Azazel(Jason Flemyng) who stole the show from the young X-MEN which include Havok, Mystique, Beast, and Banshee. That was one of the small flaws with this movie was them. I just didn't care that much about them. It felt like they were taking space from the more important characters like the relationship between Xavior and Magneto. One last thing I always like to give a shout out to actors who don't get enough work and aren't well recognized. The first is Oliver Platt who character has no name in this movie but plays a high ranking agent in the CIA. Oliver Platt is a fun actor who doesn't get enough work. The last person is Michael Ironside who plays a Captain of a American Navy ship. Michael Ironside isn't a star but a great supporting actor who's had great supporting roles in such movies such as Total Recall, Top Gun, Starship Troopers and others. Though you might recognize his voice more as he's done work for The Splinter Cell game series as the lead Sam Fisher, Superman: The Animated Series, Justice League / Justice League Unlimited to name a few.<br/><br/>The story that was blended into actual history was done really well. Especially Sebastian Shaw using the Cuba Missile Crisis for his own end was well done. The biggest problem I had with the story was the pacing of the movie. It's a small flaw but I wish they had edited out the scenes where the new X-Men students were training. I just thought they weren't really necessary but I think I might be nit picking with that. The action was really great especially in the middle of the movie when Shaw invades a CIA base. The climax was really good but they could have edited a few seconds out of it but again I think I'm nit picking with that when the action was really great.<br/><br/>The directing by Matthew Vaughn was really well done but he's had practice with his three earlier films in Layer Cake, Stardust, and Kickass which were all good films. Again the only flaw I had his directing was the pacing of the film and editing.<br/><br/>Oh yes the two cameos by actors from the first films which confirmed for me that this movies and the ones that follows are prequels. The first and longer scene was with Hugh Jackman as Wolverine though he probably hasn't been taken by the government yet. That scene was great and funny. Then there was the quick appearance of Rebecca Romijn which I though was nice.<br/><br/>Overall this movie was great and out does any of the previous films which were good and I can't wait for the next film."
"AbhinandhBabu13","9","2","5","15 June 2011"," Superb
","The Movie is really great. But I am left with some doubts. In X-Men Origins Wolverine at the end of the movie it is shown that Professor Xavier(played by Patrick Stewart) walks out of an aircraft and saves the escaping mutants. It shows him not to be in a wheelchair, which is quite contradictory to that in the new movie. Also in X-men United it is said that Magneto was the one who helped Dr. Xavier to build The Cerebro at his Mansion. I hope that will be cleared in the next movie. It was also never previously mentioned that Beast was the one who invented The Cerebro. And of course in the previous movies Mystique is not shown to have any connection or affection to Professor Xavier."
"tieman64","Null","2","5","15 June 2011"," Bring back Bryan Singer
","The ""X-Men"" franchise works best as a giant chess game, in which one team of highly specialised mutants are pitted against another. Like chess pieces, each mutant has its own gifts, powers, counters and weaknesses, and each must swear allegiance to one of two kings: Professor Xavier, who fights for peace and a brotherhood between mutants and humans, or Magneto, a Nietzschean villain who sees mutants as the master race.<br/><br/>Because of the ""chessboard"" nature of the ""X-Men"" source material, and the near-queer love affair between the opposing kings, the action in the early ""X-Men"" movies had an interesting tension. Many of the better moments in the previous films simply involved Xavier and Magneto jousting with words, sparring like modern Wizards, or eyeballing one another over a literal chessboard. Unfortunately none of the film's have particularly interesting scripts, and so eventually they all degenerated into big budget punch ups.<br/><br/>The early ""X-Men"" comics mirrored the social movements and upheavals of the 1960s. Professor X and Magneto alluded to Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, and the comics did their best to include ethnically diverse characters. ""First Class"", set in the 1960s, was itself co-written by both a woman and a homosexual (writer Jane Goldman and Bryan Singer, director of the first two movies), and genuinely tries to grapple with Cold Wear era sexism, feminism and racism. Unfortunately the film was directed by Matthew ""Kick Ass"" Vaughn, a mediocre director who perverts every idea his writers cook up, and corrupts everything in the pursuit of his dumb notions of ""cool"".<br/><br/>And so much of ""First Class"" uncritically features female mutants stripping down to their bras, panties, stockings, garters and high heels. Characters are either strippers or whores, whilst others are tied suggestively to beds and tortured. The script wants to align the Nazi's subjugation of Jews to the state sanctioned racism of super powers to modern sexism inside and outside the workplace (CIA agents are constantly belittling women etc), but Vaughn simply can't handle these things. The result is a wannabe James Bond film which salivates over its retro sexist narrative and plays up its racism and sexism for kitsch value (hence the presence of actress January Jones, who stars in the retro sexist ""Mad Men"").<br/><br/>Still, some interesting ideas slip through Vaughn's fingertips. Rather than a saintly good guy, Professor Xavier becomes a cross between a sleazy pervert and a benign patriarch, and parallels are drawn between his treatment of women and the way other oafish men in the film treat women and minorities. Despite his lofty ideals, Professor X is a pimp, every bit as authoritarian as those he despises.<br/><br/>The film tries to approach issues of race (a token black guy's death is meant to conjure up the ghosts of KKK cross/corpse burnings), but makes big missteps. Vaughn ensures that a team of white American superheroes ends up on Professor Xavier's side, whilst Magneto's ""brotherhood"" ends up being composed of everyone ""foreign"", black and female. The film then goes on to focus on Xavier's X-men rather than positioning us to empathise with Magneto and the plights of his minions. In villainizing and marginalising ""enemy mutants"", the series is guilty of exactly what it tries to condemn. It's a franchise angry at bigoted humans (who villainse the Other, all who are different), but which gets its kicks off whites beating up token, undeveloped evil mutants.<br/><br/>In terms of action sequences, ""First Class"" is mostly useless. Bryan Singer's action scenes were rather special, using silence and tension well. Vaughn, however, has no spatial sense, eschewing elaborate set pieces in favour for plot excess, cheap shocks and snappy cuts. There isn't a single decent action scene here (a butterfly chasing a screaming kid? Seriously?).<br/><br/>The first three ""X-Men"" movies starred two heavyweight actors as Magneto and Xavier: Patrick Stewart and the cunningly cast homosexual actor, Ian McKellen. Actor James McAvoy fills Stewart's big shoes well in ""First Class"", but Magneto's character is a mess, painted so demented and violent that all sympathy is lost. One of the best things about the ""X-Men"" franchise was the way humans, Xavier and Magneto all were, in a sense, ""right"", their actions somewhat justifiable. Here, however, Magneto nonsensically bounces from psycho to good-guy to raging psycho.<br/><br/>Of course, the fact that Brett ""super hack"" Ratner directed the conclusion of Xavier and Magneto's relationship - Xavier's death in ""X-Men 3"" - makes following this new duo somewhat pointless. Ratner has already ruined these characters' history. Why follow them if their relational climax is ultimately in Ratner's hands? <br/><br/>The film's plot is reheated Cold War nuclear missile nonsense (this is what sparked a global war between humans and mutants?), the kind of tale that bad B movies rendered stale long ago. Beyond this the film plays like a giant game of connect-the-dots, Vaughn too busy trying to tick boxes and link his film up with X-Men lore. Strange then that the film so heavily ignores X-Men continuity. Rather than long-time friends, Magneto and Xavier, in this film, know one another for a matter of moments, Vaughn singularly uninterested in their rich history, rivalry, friendship and relationship. Why make a prequel if you're simply going to rush through X-Men mythology and end up right back at the status quo? And why does the film rush toward robbing a young Xavier the use of his legs, when earlier X-films show Patrick Stewart walking when much older? In any case, Vaughn has achieved the extraordinary; he's made a film worse than Brett Ratner. ""First Class"" is just so new and shiny we don't realise it yet.<br/><br/>7.5/10 – Worth two viewings."

","Though many have falsely labelled this the Batman Begins of the X-Men franchise, it is undoubtedly the reboot needed for the franchise after 2009's disastrous X-Men Origins: Wolverine, and while it doesn't have the pulsating energy of Kick-Ass nor merit the bravo of Batman Begins it does provide the much needed direction after films 3 and 4.<br/><br/>It'd be fair to call this a prequel too, back tracking to the origins of its famous founders of the X-Men. James McAvoy stars as smooth talking Charles Xavier, a recently successful graduate and Michael Fassbender as the tormented victim of WWII who seeks revenge. The two ultimately meet and share the same goal for wanting to help fellow mutants but go to extreme and opposite lengths to achieve this goal.<br/><br/>Vaughn yet again proves there are still areas to be found and new notes to be struck in the superhero genre. The action has never looked (or felt) more intense, the drama more emotional but rewarding and the general experience one that will surely be relived by people who aren't just hard-core comic book viewers.<br/><br/>However it would have far more impressive as a debut for a first time director, and you can't help but draw comparisons to Vaughn's previous (and in Kick-Ass's case: better) work. It lacks the brilliance for someone who knows how to handle the genre and material he is presented with, but don't get me wrong for the fast-paced ride it proves to be X-Men First Class is a lot of fun, and with an unexpected cameo, great chemistry – particularly between Fassbender and McAvoy and a story that is both satisfying and original it's definitely worth a look. <br/><br/>Just don't go in expecting too much – you may be left feeling slightly disappointed."
"ascavera","8","2","5","12 June 2011"," An Absolute Excitement.. Two Thumbs up!!
","When they announced that the new X-men was a work in progress, I was wondering whether there was anything to build on, the series was in shambles and following Wolverine:Origins it was downhill all the way. It was a pleasant surprise, however, when X-Men:First Class hit the big screen. The Screenplay is top notch and expressive, setting about just the right mood to convey the notion of the original comic book adventure. They do build on certain issues like the Prototype X-jet and the Cerebro, trying to tie up certain loose ends in the past. Yes, Charles Xavier walks about, until the end of the movie and one would not guess how his team came to be called the X-men, talk of introducing an idea to a telepathic head.. The special effects rock and it is as fascinating to watch Havoc and his energy blasts as it is to see Magneto try and hold a submarine back, underwater..I have never been so glad at movies based on comic books ever before.. Having said, in essence, that the crew have done a great job, I come to one point I find rather bothersome. James McAvoy seems a little distraught throughout the whole movie, quite unlike his older self in the past movies, the quiet, calm, expressionless self.. I think this was a bit of an overwork, compared to what I remember from my comic reading days, and I would have loved to have seen the unperturbed, sensible portrayal of Professor Xavier. It is a great movie overall, despite the fact that one story element is a bit overworked and out of sync with its comic counterpart. The movie is basically a spin-off from the original storyline, and the way I look at it, it is a reboot to the franchise, and now they have something more to build upon.."
"troy-manatunga","5","2","5","11 June 2011"," ""X Men: First Class"" is highly overrated
","Good action sequences and irregular spikes in character development are always better than not having any. I would not wish to mislead the reader right from the start, since ""X Men: First Class"" is one of those movies that many of us impatiently looked forward to this summer. In a nutshell ""X Men: First Class"" although is not the best in the franchise it does at times manage to reach out and speak to the audience. This movie has been the best in the franchise to some and this movie is also being considered a top notch CGI treat and an astonishing action flick. However to me it threw out mixed signals, although I would watch it again on DVD someday, I would like to make my insight very clear on this. ""X Men: First Class"" is highly overrated and feeble in its plot with lesser focus on character growth which in a prequel is VITAL I think. This is how I prepared myself to watch the supposedly massively entertaining summer blockbuster ""X Men: First Class"". I took the time to watch the entire X men Quadrilogy once again; refreshed my memory and then I made my way to the theatre. I was fresh in my mind and had all the X men facts lined up quite neatly. Is it only me or did anyone else notice the fact that in ""X Men: The Last Stand"" Professor X and Magneto were still close friends and Professor X was still walking when they went to pay a visit to young Jean. Not to mention he was pretty much bald as well at that point of time and also hands out a leaflet of his Xavier's School for the gifted to Jeans parents. Seems like writers didn't want to be very precise on the facts since Professor X is on his cool X Men wheel chair and he has a lovely growth of hair in the greatest prequel said to have been made! Mismatch? Why? This was the cherry on the icing for me to be very stern on my view that ""X Men: First Class"" failed me. Sluggish and slow for over 40 minutes and very slow character developments is one the factors that disheartened me and affected my viewing pleasure. Seem like the great enemies Magneto and Professor X decided to go their own ways for a reason so trivial that it made me laugh in the end. They almost could have wrapped it up as a great movie if all the loose ends would have been given more thought. Speaking on the areas of CGI seems a bit tricky, however I need to be honest and say that a greater part of the movie the CGI was well at average if not even better. A majority of the CGI was very intelligently thought through with the exception of one. The missiles on the beach looked a bit like it came out of a Nintendo 64! Sadly this is all I can share without spoiling it for you readers in case you have not watched the movie yet. If you ever do watch it, pay very close attention to the missiles on the beach and you will see what I mean. At the risk of the cliché every cloud has its silver lining! In a very bland environment, the bond between Professor X and Magneto (Erik) at the soon to be Xavier's school for the gifted reached out to me and I actually felt a strong connection between the two mutants and was most welcomed beautiful experience. James McAvoy and Micheal Fassbender plays it exceptionally well and really works some magic with their characters despite the fact of the weakly written script that gave them only that much to work on. Kevin Bacon was the ideal villain and he fitted Sebastian Shaw like the perfect leather glove. With such great casting and with some convincing acting its shocking how Matthew Vaughn could not pull this movie to shore. Should one watch it should one not? Since its X MEN I think one should. However I am glad I never purchased a ticket to watch this, I walked in with a free movie pass, so I feel my money was saved! To our intelligent and passionate movie lovers, this one is entirely over to you!"
"neenahhh","9","2","5","11 June 2011"," First Class is right
","I will be honest and say that I haven't fully watched the X-Men trilogy, but this prequel made me want to watch all the movies. I guess I know what I'm going to be doing in the next couple of weeks.<br/><br/>I know that this movie is part of a bigger franchise, but this was a GREAT film on its own. Although, it will leave you wanting more. I know I'm dying for another movie. In ""X-Men: First Class"", I don't think there was ever a dull scene. I remember being interested in it all the way. I never felt my attention waver or feel a yawn coming up.<br/><br/>Aside from the kick-ass action, this movie had its own share of good humor that doesn't fail. The audience must have laughed out loud together, at least three times. I also especially liked the emotions that were being portrayed to the audience. I could care less about Raven's love life, but I really did love the bromance that Charles and Erik shared.<br/><br/>I don't have any other X-Men movies to compare this one to (aside from the spin-off ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine""), so this may either be a hit or miss with die-hard X-Men fans. But coming from an unbiased viewer, I can say that this was an excellent film. If you haven't watched it yet, what are you waiting for?!<br/><br/>Viewed on: June 11, 2011"
"UAWildcat28","8","2","5","11 June 2011"," Entertaining, but not eye popping
","I noticed all the silliness that the movie had, however I just have to overlook all that stuff because there was enough excitement and actual good storytelling. Those parts helped forget the terrible beginning (seriously, young Eric had no problem disposing of those two soldiers, why not kill Sebastian Shaw right then and there? The way he looked when he yelled was hilarious. That part made no sense at all.), the silly introduction of Beast (Beast, not Hank), the silly introductions of all the names overall, the decision of some of the mutants to choose a side was also laughable, and the laughable form of Eric using his powers. I'll even ask this: why is Eric helping lead the charge of finding these mutants? It seemed like Charles and Eric were forced into a quick relationship because that's what was supposed to happen. The movie didn't flow smoothly either. It was so disjointed that it made The Last Stand look like the most straight forward movie ever. It was better than Wolverine at least.<br/><br/>But I say: so what? The movie was entertaining and worth seeing. There were a ton of laughs. Yeah I was expecting something totally dark or at least near the tone of the second movie, especially with Matthew Vaughn (Kick-Ass) directing. Yet, there was a nice balance of darkness and humor.<br/><br/>Overall, I thought the movie was good, not great, but good. Good enough to see at least once (for me, I will definitely see it again)."

She's not just the bad-ass blue girl anymore.

","I am passing this on from a close friend of mine who does not post on boards his reviews and our discussion with others of our trade, Comic Books, Artists,Producers and Writers.<br/><br/>They love this film.<br/><br/>For all the right reasons to. Because this film is more about super heroes and good storytelling than it is about scraping a generations wallets with the exploitation of heroes from their youth. It is a film that helps break down the idea that continuity of storyline matters at all in the world of comic heroes. Which it doesn't.<br/><br/>I am not speaking of anything that happens in this film but in general when I say. So what if the dead spring back to life under dubious circumstances or people who were young at one point are now in the past as adults. Each story is a universe unto itself and these characters are not bound by the expectations of people who do not have the imagination to see what matters in storytelling. So, if you love a good story, well made and refreshingly honest, go see this one.<br/><br/>Even I was skeptical, especially as since I am an editor, I found the original trailer to be one of the most embarrassingly trite representations of a film in this season. All it needed was a Mr Movie Phone Narration and I would have thrown something at the screen.<br/><br/>The Comic Artist who I am speaking of is the voice I am listening to on this film. My pal was the youngest artist ever to be hired as a main artist to Justice League of America in 1987. His career is stellar and he consistently produces some of the finest no holds barred comic storytelling to this day. You don't believe me, fine. But if you don't know the title, Go check out, ""The Boys"".<br/><br/>The point is that while many of these box office watchers are gauging this film on how it does at the box office. Even more are bashing it for no reason other than, they can.Box Office Mojo should be more responsible for their reviews, as they are in fact not reviews at all. They are business reports, that act as if money is the only factor that makes a film worth viewing. Such a lack of care for what they report itself becomes a factor in how a film does. I would not doubt that the reviewer had not even seen the film reported on by the manner in which it is reported on. The all time worst excuse I have heard so far from BOM, ""Where is Wolverine?""<br/><br/>Who cares where wolverine is? He has his own movie, which in many of us who make and love comics opinion, was the worst of all the x-men films hands down.<br/><br/>Just because more people went to Wolverine and were disappointed on the opening weekend than this film has had sit down to watch it in no valid way to to gauge this films value.<br/><br/>Thank you and enjoy the film!!"

It also zoomed in on the lives of Raven Darkholme aka Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) and Hank McCoy aka Beast (Nicholas Hoult). It was great from the beginning, to the climax, right down to the final scene. This movie in my opinion is a 10 out of 10, all the way. Lets see if this can stay on the top 250 list."
"filmfreak-ochoa23","10","2","5","6 June 2011"," The Definitive X-Men Movie
","X-Men First Class- 2011 Review<br/><br/>This is the definitive X-Men movie without a doubt, somehow resembling the action of the animated feature Hulk VS Wolverine in a live action form, which only X2 came close before but not as close as this one. By adding the Cuba Missile Crisis into the plot and radiation which eradicates humans but will increase mutation is a most excellent idea that makes perfect sense within this universe. The revenge scheme of Magneto throughout the movie is handled very personally along with Xavier caring about other mutants, and very creative ways of showing off the powers of every single one of the characters especially Magneto and Xavier. The humor gives the characters to interact with one another and the audience to catch up on the uniqueness of the different powers and the origins of the mutant names is an excellent addition. Many reviewers have agreed that this is the Vader path to the dark side story and I agree, this is how Lucas should have handled the prequel story with Anakin. By the end of the movie, even if the audience knew that Erik was Magneto and the bad guy of the Brotherhood, emotion was felt when he turned to the dark side and you felt the grief that Xavier went through by losing his friend. Every single character's motivations were understandable and the audience could literally side with anyone in the film, be it the Hellfire Club led by Shaw with intentions very similar to Magneto, Magneto's revenge scheme, Xavier's interest in other mutants, the new recruits and Mystique's longing for acceptance and how they go about it, either eradicating all humans with extreme prejudice or longing to achieve a peace with them. This is where the friendship between Erik and Xavier splits and the movie has a villain which very easily could be the protagonist if told from his point of view and that is how it is done! By eliminating the black and white dynamic and making it more gray to a point where the hero could be the villain or the villain could be the hero, depending on the point of view from which is seen. Not to mention, the humans went insane at the end and truly showed the destructive capabilities and for lack of a better word, bad-assness of the humans when they are to the brink of pure fear with facing something unknown and powerful. The cameos from the first movie were a nice touch as well, on another subject and finishing this review, this movie is a masterpiece and the perfect X-Men movie."
"Willofthedead","10","2","5","6 June 2011"," An Amateur Review of X-Men: First Class.
","First things first, this movie was stunning.<br/><br/>Though this movie was plagued with the worst marketing ideas by FOX I have ever seen, thankfully, X-Men: First Class did not suffer the same fate of it's marketing plan. X-Men: First Class was a superhero film that didn't feel like a superhero film. With that said, it was definitely different than what one might might suspect from a ""superhero movie."" The best way I can describe how this movie was put together would be to say that this was like a spy film set in the 1960s with people whom happened to have superpowers.<br/><br/>The acting. Honestly, in my opinion, the acting was pretty solid. I believe that the actors did a wonderful job with trying to bring the characters to life, not mention the great characterizations that flowed through the movie as the film progressed. X-Men First Class provided so many powerful scenes on various levels of emotions, the acting for this movie as a whole was exceptional and well executed, in my opinion. If you were already a fan of the X-Men, you know how easy it is to take a liking to the characters, and I feel that the film does this well.<br/><br/>As far as the story goes, it's told wonderfully. It contains the right amount of action, intelligence, and plot development one should have expected from story writer Bryan Singer, whom directed ""X-Men"" and ""X2"" and director Matthew Vaughn whom directed ""Kick-Ass."" Another note to point out to the ""fans"" of X-Men that are sure to put this film aside is simply because of their issue with continuity in relation to the comic books. The films are respectably canon in it's own stand alone franchise, not meant to be compared to the books. The X-Men universe is a large and vast mythos consisting of over 72+ different books/series carrying the X-Men name. What I like about what Bryan Singer does with the X-Men movies, is that he transfers the characters, themes, ideas, and their purpose successfully from the X-Men universe as any adaption should be.<br/><br/>I'd like to take a minute to think of something negative to say about this movie, but in all honestly there isn't much to complain about. If I had to pull up something to complain about, it would probably be the slight need for me to want to have seen more development for the minor characters that didn't have much focus in the film. Another thing that came to mind would be the brief training montage only because the sequence brought back memories from Ang Lee's ""Hulk."" (which is not even on the same level as ""The Incredible Hulk"" starring Edward Norton). I believe X-Men: First Class was a respectable adaption.<br/><br/>All in all this was not only a good X-Men film but also a great film based on a comic book. It's not your typical movie, but it definitely competes with some of the other well known comic book movies such as Spider-Man 2, The Dark Night, Iron Man, and the new Thor movie. In my opinion, First Class exceeds previous comic book movies I've seen. I'd hate to spoil the movie from anyone, but X-Men First class was pretty groovy.<br/><br/>(tl;dr movie was ballin; go see it)"
"jmwingding","8","2","5","6 June 2011"," a great graphic novel superhero movie
","I liken this movie to others like The Watchmen and Batman: The Dark Knight, in that it watched like a graphic novel superhero movie rather than your typical superhero comic book flick. the movie was sophisticated and smart. There was less of the splash and flash that you get from other, big budget superhero movies. On the other hand, X Men: First Class flaunted a strong script, great acting (James McAvoy was charming as Professor X, although his presence in seemingly most every scene in the movie was a little much), a fully wrought out story, and enough quality action to satisfy comics fans. other things i like about X Men first class: Magneto is given some love. You come away from the movie respecting him, sympathizing with him, even though you realize that eventually he will become the archenemy. I liked how the movie dealt with Mystique's character, which was nicely explored (not to mention, she is pleasing on the eyes). With her and magneto, we learn that bad and good is not just a black and white thing. Through them we find people that have needs, or that have certain events in their history which require resolution; and these provide the motivation for them to act as they do. Who are we to condemn them? The movie had sort of a ""what if superheroes existed in real life?"" feel to it. Sort of like an Alex Ross painting, but on film. Good stuff. We got to see some out-of-the-way characters like Sebastian Shaw, Emma Frost, Banshee and Havok. I did have some issue with calling the winged girl Angel, but we realize the movie diverted from the actual comic book origin, so... oh! and it was great seeing Kevin Bacon in a superhero movie role--and it wasn't silly or hammed-up or anything!"

","In my review of scream 4 i made fun of another film which made some people angry so i am sorry now on to x men first class this review will have lots of spoilers so watch out the start of this film was very we done and so was the end fight the acting was all so very good there was just some very small problems which made a huge pile.One of the problems was that professor x tired to be funny the hole film but i never laughed once at his joke's there was a cameo which was very funny but i am not going to spoil it because its grate.The film was also very long which was good.There is just not enough character development with havoc and all the villains are OK in the film but the stand out thing is the special effects which are good so in the end go sea this film full price"
"Akira-36","9","2","5","6 June 2011"," A great beginning with lots of fun and poignant moments
","The direction, story and acting in this movie is near perfect. Matthew Vaughn has sealed his credibility as a solid storyteller who weaves poignant character developments with fun action sequences. The set pieces, balance, pacing and cameos are well crafted. <br/><br/>I had reservation about the choices of mutants before watching the movie but now I understand that they were selected for the right reasons. And that is to present the audience with a prequel that not only raises the bar for the franchise but also revives my faith in the series. X-Men 3 and Wolverine were short of disasters, but here the cast and crews have managed to breath a new life into a series that was getting near to downright embarrassment. <br/><br/>Even though the movie is set as a prequel it never failed to deliver a mature performance unmarred by asinine silliness that often haunts action/superheroes genre when majority of the cast involves adolescents.<br/><br/>The movie is largely based on the New X-Men saga by Grant Morrison, but it's not considered canon because it sits between the main and the Ultimate timelines. <br/><br/>The stage is set, the quality is astounding so let's bring on the rest of the sequels."
"termitekeith","8","2","5","6 June 2011"," Solid Prequel
","Why does this movie work? Because we care about the characters which isn't always something we can say about an action movie. Although the CGI is excellent it never becomes the star of the movie like so many films of this genre where we just wait for the dialouge to end so we can watch the special effects.<br/><br/>Almost from the beginning we are drawn into the relationships. We care about Magneto (Michael Fassbender) and sympathize with him and understand why he doesn't trust mankind. He's only seen the ugly side of it throughout his youth. His counterpart Professor X (James McAvoy) has grown up in wealth and privilege and is far more idealistic.<br/><br/>And lets be honest. The dilemma here is that they have a problem in which they both have a piece of the truth. Magneto is right. There will always be a segment of the human race that will fear and hate the mutants. Mankind is partially right too. There WILL almost certainly be some mutants who will go anti social with there powers no matter what type of treatment they get from human beings.<br/><br/>A few nitpicks with the film, it barely stays PG13 and really isn't a kids movie so beware for those of you who plan to take children under 10. Most PG13 movies can get away with at least one F-bomb and this one does although its done very cleverly and with a surprising character who utters it. And there are PLENTY of scantily/barely clad women. As a matter of fact there is barely an ounce of fat anywhere in this movie. Also, did women wear mini skirts that short in the early 60's, and did they really pull the old ""kill the black character first"" cliché? As I said these are just nitpicks. THis is an excellent fast paced flick that entertains from start to finish.<br/><br/>There is also a barely concealed political agenda here. There is a lot of talk about coming out, being proud of who you are, not hiding, being ""cured"" and one character says ""SInce you didn't ask I didn't tell"" Hmmmmm."
"nits_ss","9","2","5","5 June 2011"," Story of mutants in the human world
","While the movie will appeal to both Xmen followers and comic books followers, it has something for everyone from popcorn eaters to serious action genre followers. While I have watched Spiderman, Batman and recent Marvel comic movies; it seems all those movies did fine due to a emphasis on plot, character play and fine acting. X-men First does not disappoint in any category. The director has risked the movie by relying heavily on the relationship between Charles (Prof X) and Erik(Magneto) and it pays off handsomely. Lead by fine performances bu both protagonists and ably supported by others, this movie is a treat to watch. Best summer movie of 2011 so far!!"
"usernamena1","10","2","5","5 June 2011"," One of the greatest, if not THE greatest superhero movie ever made
","Its simply fun. No matter what age you are or even if you aren't a comic book fan you will still enjoy this movie because we can all relate to it. Its about fitting in and the want to be special. To say the acting is superb would be an understatement, the story is slick and well paced, the direction is flawless and it all comes together in a magnificent and epic way. Do NOT miss this movie, its great fun and Michael Fassbender's acting itself pays for the movie ticket. Kevin Bacon is excellent as the devious Sebastian Shaw, James McAvoy is great as the charismatic Xavier and all female actors did a great job with their characters with the expection of January Jones but I doubt most people will complain. Like I said, go watch it, it might be one of the best superhero movies ever made"
"echozdog-1","9","2","5","5 June 2011"," Very Well done
","This is fresh, the X-men are forming. It's the back story that's more exciting and fun than the later stuff. The actors are all stars in the making making them believable as their characters. I mean the last movies you really expected Professor X to say ""make it so"" at any moment. The back story of the Cuban missile crisis is fantastic nuclear war threat that the villain organizes reminds me of the villain plots of the 60s Bond movies. The 60s music and sexy outfits if a fun setting for the backdrop of the movie. Great movie.<br/><br/>Verdict: This makes the last X-men movies look like sequels that went on too long."
"zoegargulak","10","2","5","5 June 2011"," Love It ;-)
","I saw this movie on Friday the 5th and I was expecting no to enjoy it very much since the original 5 x-men were not in it but it ended up being my favourite movie of the year so far. It's got a great story line but can be a little tricky to understand at some points but is still great. <br/><br/>If you didn't understand things from the x-men trilogy or x-men origins: Wolverine I highly recommend going to see it. It cleared up allot of questions I had :-)<br/><br/>If you're debating if you want to see it or not just go. When I went to the cinema there were girls, boys, teens, adults and elderly people and they all loved it - it just proves that anyone will enjoy it."

","Despite the common verdict that puns represent the lowest form of humour, they are ever popular. So, has this clever movie title earned its place? The exalting praise of ""first class"" is usually over-used. Still, ""X-men: First Cast"" can arguably be considered the best in the franchise to-date, as generally agreed by movie critics and audience.<br/><br/>As an action flick, this movie is exceptionally rich in themes and sub-texts. Consistently in the background and coming forth to the forefront at suitable junctures is the franchise's main theme: the place of mutants in the world of ""normal"" human beings, a variation of the familiar minority issue. Very cleverly superimposed onto this movie is a chapter in modern history that the world well remembers: the Cuban Missile Crisis, but with a twist – as ex-Nazi Sebastian Shaw's conspiracy. And then, there is a brief but distinct sub-text on recklessness when one is young (""youth will have its fling"", W. S. Gilbert's favourite lyrics), as exemplified in the young mutant recruits' party-making when they were left to themselves in the CIA research centre where they are accommodated.<br/><br/>Those are at the macro level. On the intimate personal stories, there is ample evidence of close attention paid in development of characters and relationships, absolutely devoid of often-seen sloppy laziness in many lesser movies in this genre. Most prominent is the friendship and eventual falling out between Charles Xavier (young Professor X) and Erik Lehnsherr (young Magneto). Another key character Raven (young Mystique) is also thoughtfully conceived and positioned, in a sort-of triangle, ""sort-of"" because although Xavier had discovered her since they were young children, what he had for her is sibling love. Mystique's gradual shifting and eventual allegiance with Magneto is convincingly plotted with strategically places scene throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Equally sensibly, contrary to the meticulous care given to the key characters, some minor characters are treated almost if they were mere props, notably Sebastian Shaw's pair of bodyguards (as if he needs any) who are little more than weapons in human form – Riptide and Azazel. This is necessary because there is such a proliferation of characters in between, requiring varying degrees of depth in handling. These will be addressed later in conjunction with the various actors playing these parts.<br/><br/>As a prequel, ""First Class"" is among the best in carefully establishing ""what happened before"", such as Magneto's helmet, Xavier's wheelchair (""I'm not going to move. I can't even feel my legs""), Xavier's school for mutants etc. The most important question is of course what made Magneto what he is today. While the preludes of Star Wars take three movies to chart Anakin Skywalker's transformation to Darth Vader, Magneto's dark side is fully explained in ""First Class"" (reportedly the first of the X-men prequel trilogy). Except for the three key characters mentioned, no others from the franchise appear except for 20-second cameo of Logan. And what an uproar of mirth Hugh Jackman's one-liner extracted from the audience! Casting this movie must have been a huge job, and it was a job well done. James McAvoy is a believable young Xavier (not because he says ""Maybe I'll go bald some day"") with just the right amounts of doses of compassion, brilliance and authority. Michael Fassbender is probably better remembered in his military role in ""Inglourious Basterds"" than as Connors the gentle but immoral seducer in ""Fish Tank"", two performances that testified to his diversity. To Magneto, he brings an explosive intensity and a subtly perceptible humanity. Latest Oscar nominee from ""Winter's bone"" Jennifer Lawrence makes a good job of Mystique as a teenage girl, blue-skinned or otherwise. Kevin Bacon is iconic chief villain Sebastian Shaw is a natural.<br/><br/>Of the assortment of other mutants on both sides, two have been given heavier roles. The name Nicholas Hoult may not ring a bell but those who have seen ""About a boy"" (2002) should remember the boy. A few years later, in ""The weather man"" (2005) he played Nicholas Cage's titular character's gentle, introvert son. He now plays the equally timid young scientist Hank MaCoy, timid until his full Frankenstein complex is released, turning him into Beast. January Jones is a name that will be remember on its own, but the actress also showed her worth in the recent movie ""Unknown"" (2011) as a wife who suddenly and mysterious denies all knowledge or recognition of her husband (a role played by Liam Neeson). Here, she is Emma Frost, who is to Sebastian Shaw what Mystique is to Magneto.<br/><br/>Two ""minority"" characters (to be interpreted here as one without mutant power) deserve mention. Rose Byrne has appeared in a good number of movies with a variety of roles. The one I remember most is ""Adam"" (2009) in which her character has a bitter-sweet romance with an endearing autistic young man played by Hugh Dancy. In ""First Class"" she plays endearing CIA agent Moira who discovered Xavier and the rest of them. Oliver Platt, who needs no introduction, plays a character with no name, a CIA researcher identified as ""Man in black suit"", and obvious tribute to ""Man in black"" (1997).<br/><br/>The special effects in ""First Class"" are excellent. The sets are slick, in a very pleasing sort of way."
"Shanetmims","10","2","5","5 June 2011"," First Class is not to be missed!
","Wow! Just wow! And believe me,it takes something truly great to leave me almost speechless! X-men:First Class was amazing,spectacular,emotional,fun,.........Need I go on? On to the review. <br/><br/>X-men:First Class is about the epic origins of the X-men and the friendship between Xavier and Magneto that became a rivalry.For fans of the comics or the previous four films,this is the film to see! This movie has more depth and covers more ground in 132 minutes than the last two films achieved.<br/><br/>First Class,as I said before,deals with Eric Lensherr /Magneto's and Professor Charles Xavier's relationship before their friendship became what it was in the original trilogy. Xavier(James MacAvoy)is a leading expert on genetic mutations when the origins of the X-Men begin when a CIA operative named Moira McTaggert(Rose Byrne)recruits him,and his half sister Raven,who will become the villain Mystique,to stop the nefarious Sebastian Shaw(Kevin Bacon)from starting World War 3 through what history refers to as the Cuban Missle Crisis.<br/><br/>Meanwhile,Eric(Michael Fassbender)is tracking down Shaw and his associates,who are responsible for killing his mother directly in front of him,and he wants revenge.When Xavier and Eric finally meet,they find common ground,and begin to locate and recruit mutants to form a resistance to Shaw's own group of mutants.They recruit(and these are the code names)Havok,who can generate discs of energy throughout his body;Darwin,who can adapt to any environment,Angel,who can fly and spit fireballs;Banshee,who has a high-piercing scream that can shatter glass,can be used as sonar,and allows him to fly(along with glider wings),and Beast,who has enlarged feet which allows for faster speeds and improved dexterity.<br/><br/>Along with Mystique,the X-men are formed and are put through training.As this progress,characters not only develop their powers,but some of the mutants personalities' and even appearances for one of them begin to change as well,as allegiances will change and a character will pay the price for his inability to accept his own self-worth.<br/><br/>This all leads to a brilliant conclusion as the X-men and the Hellfire Club meet and the fate of humanity will be decided as the Cuban Missle Crisis will begin.<br/><br/>I knew this would be good,but I wasn't expecting this! This is the best X-men film since X2,and lives up to the standard set up by the first two X-films.This is an action packed film,and yet,still develops the characters to where you understand the characters even better than before.<br/><br/>James MacAvoy and Michael Fassbender are excellent in their roles.MacAvoy portrays Xavier as a womanizer who also is a bit of a party guy,and yet,when he is the mentor we all know and love,you buy it instantly. He honors Stewart from the previous three,yet brings something new to the character.Fassbender is terrific as Magneto. You feel for him when necessary,but he still is as intense as McKellen was in the previous three. <br/><br/>They are supported by a great cast:Jennifer Lawrence plays the young Mystique,and comes across as a young Rebecca Romijn brilliantly,and you really feel for her,and understand her motivations for what she ultimately becomes perfectly.Nicolas Hoult is terrific as Beast,creating a smart and heartfelt performance,and when he does become the big blue guy,not only does his look suit his new codename,but he has earned your compassion,as well. The rest of the cast is great as well,with special mention to Kevin Bacon,who makes for a imposing,seductive,and disturbed Shaw.<br/><br/>The action delivers! It is jaw-dropping,epic,and actually is thought out in an intelligent manner.The X-men are almost secret agents with mutant powers,and I like how they did that.The 60's setting really helps the movie,giving a real sense of history,while still working as a superhero film. CGI is great,and the score is effective. Matthew Vaughn and Bryan Singer bring,along with the rest of the cast and crew, everything together for an experience you'll never forget.<br/><br/>When all is said and done,everything has been set up for a sequel,and for the first time since X2 ended,I can't wait for the next one! See this,and you won't be disappointed!"
"ACMcC24","9","2","5","4 June 2011"," Three reasons to watch this movie: Bacon, Fassbender, and McAvoy
","Admittedly, I had certain expectations going to see this movie. Some of them were met, some were exceeded, and then some weren't. I'll start off with the bad just to get them out of the way. I'll include a fact or two from the movie but, hopefully, nothing important.<br/><br/>The biggest problem I had with this movie is that the director seemed so fixated on the ""period piece"" rather than the friendship between Erik and Charles that it almost felt at times that the mutants were an afterthought in comparison to the plot of creating another World War. There was very little delving into their friendship let alone the creation of the X-Men team. I'm sorry, but one week of training isn't enough to teach Havok or Banshee to control their powers. I'll trust that is what the sequel will be for, though. <br/><br/>The concept of the outcasts, of ""us vs. them"" and ""peace vs. war"" was played up nicely. The tension was obvious from the start and the blind ignorance that is to blame was also obvious, even a bit too obvious. The writers did a great job at skimming the surface of the problems to come so I hope that the sequel also delves into the causes of this ignorance more. What would also be nice is too really see how Magneto and Professor X deal with these issues on their own terms. <br/><br/>McAvoy and Fassbender steal any scene they're in, whether together or separately. The best thing for this movie was to cast these two together. That being said, I do believe that McAvoy and Fassbender weren't used to their full potential. What little time you do see the two together philosophizing was never enough given their chemistry on screen. I just wish more time had been spent on these things rather than Shaw's plot. But, when you have someone like Kevin Bacon in a movie - any movie - who knows how to play up a character like Shaw, you can't waste him. Every move Bacon made as Shaw, every expression made and line spoken with a specific tone of voice was delivered flawlessly. Over all, I would watch the movie again not because of the plot, but because of it's three main actors and the strengths each of them brought to their characters. When each of them was on screen as Eric, Charles, or Shaw, I believed them. The score I gave this movie was because of them.<br/><br/>As for the remaining supporting cast, they did their jobs well enough. Lucas Till as Havok, Jones as Banshee, and Hoult as Beast definitely stood out, though I know I'm not the only one to say that I had gotten use to Kelsey Grammar as Beast. It was obvious that January Jones as Frost was there as nothing more than eye candy given she played the role with nothing more than a straight face. Kudos to Lawrence for playing Raven in full body makeup as much as she did. She did an excellent job as someone struggling with her identity. The remaining characters came and went, even Rose Byrn and Zoe Kravitz. Byrn was given very little to work with while Kravitz was given more screen time than what was needed for her character."
"aernest","8","2","5","4 June 2011"," Extremely well-done
","Having sat through Wolverine, I wondered if this franchise was doomed, but this movie was a pleasant surprise. The direction was witty and well-paced. I know it's odd to point out the set design, but it was FABULOUS. There is a definite 60's- James-Bond-Bad-Guy-Lair vibe to some of the sets, and it's quite fun. George Lucas could take a few lessons from this director about how and when to use CGI. The CGI enhances, but never dominates the story. The fights weren't SO protracted that you started wondering when they would be over. Standouts in the cast were, of course, McAvoy and Fassbinder. I had never seen McAvoy in anything before, and he certainly delivers the goods in the charm department. Who knew Xavier was such a smoothie with the ladies? And Fassbinder is one to watch - not only is he wonderfully easy on the eyes, but his acting in this role carried a welcome and dangerous intensity that was definitely called for. (He did seem to get very Irish near the end of the movie, though.) January Jones as Emma Frost is a hoot - just watching her deadpan around in one outrageous 60's outfit after another is pretty funny, and again, sort of a Bond throwback. One thing bothered me a little - Kevin Bacon as the villain. He's really not bad, but he's not a good enough actor to make me forget that he's Kevin Bacon. All the young 'uns were respectively good, and seemed to be having fun. The audience did too. Nice job all around."

The rest of the cast members were solid, but these three stood out far beyond my expectations, which were high to begin with.<br/><br/>Although there might be some mythological errors in terms of the comics being adapted to the big screen, it's definitely something that can easily be over-looked.<br/><br/>The CGI, dialogue, action, acting, and script were in perfect unison.<br/><br/>There really isn't much more you could ask for from this film, except another one just like it to keep the X-Men franchise as strong as it can and should be."

","The first three films had there ups and there downs and then came Wolverine's personal film to which it garnered mixed reviews. X-Men first class was a wonderful breath of fresh air.<br/><br/>What made this movie wonderful was the relatively unknown actors that they casted, in the first four films the cast was packed with actors of the likes as Sir Ian Mckellan, Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, and more. This is the first film I have watched with Jennifer Lawerance and I believe her to have been one of the focal points for the film; the story of mystique is so intricate that it's wonderful to see it in flesh and blood and acted out splendidly.<br/><br/>Fassbender and McAvoy worked out wonderfully together (no pun intended)really they complemented each other the toughness with the softness and through in some sexuality and were good to go. The other x-men were funny,witty, and smart, and its always exciting to see your comic book heroes come to life (Banshee, Azazel, Emma...).<br/><br/>The sets and costumes of the film were fantastic, its great to see everything in a different time period and see how it evolves later on. On top of that the story was solid and very creative, it added more depth to the story and made our history of that period seem more realistic.<br/><br/>With that a great story+fantastic acting+and great sets= a fantastic, near perfect movie. All you marvel fans rejoice this one is a keeper."
"Hocklife","8","2","5","3 June 2011"," A Reinvigorated Franchise
","When I first heard another origin story was being crafted for the X-Men franchise I instantly felt weary. It has only been 2 years since Wolverine got a chance at his very own prequel and it failed for me on many different levels. Leaving a profound feeling of an ailing franchise refusing to let itself and a business looking to suck every last dollar out of the consumer's veins before heading the way of Atlantis. It brings great relief to say with the fullest confidence that not only does this movie reinvigorate the X-Men movies with a prequel reboot it also redeems itself on its last two predecessors.<br/><br/>Summary First Class aptly set during the political and social unrest of the 1960's gives director (Vaughn) a chance at showing this era in a very stylish way. Dealings with the real world event that was the October crisis of 1962 ( Cuban Missile crisis) which is used as a visually stunning but at times cheesy rewrite of history. However, this was merely a very cool backdrop for the climax of the movie. Sebastian Shaw (Bacon) is attempting to ignite World War 3 by pushing the sides of both governments (Soviet Union and The United States to make aggressive moves towards one another. Let me state this plainly, this is without doubt the best action in all the five movies , easily and theirs a ton of it to boot! <br/><br/>X-Men franchise begins with the story of two very different people. Charles Xavier(McAvoy)and Eric Lehnsherr (Fassbender). Both destined to be best friends (if you've seen the original trilogy) both destined to be archenemies. With that knowledge already present the movie to succeed for me had to keep the characters interesting and make their progression from who they are to who they will be believable. Thankfully the movie doesn't miss a beat here and the situations that drive these two characters are powerful and outstandingly acted that they alone can carry this film. After two great performances by the young Professor X and Magneto the two other most well developed characters are Raven (Lawrence) and Beast(Hoult) who strive to find normalcy in their looks. This is a great component of the movie because although they start with a common goal their ideals won't remain the same (very similar to the main two characters of the film). The definition of what is beauty is constantly brought up throughout the film by the main four characters and their takes on it.<br/><br/>Unfortunately while these four characters are great it leaves the rest of the films super heroes (and villains!) completely neglected. The films main antagonist Shaw (Bacon) is the only developed baddie in the whole thing everyone else is only cardboard with a superpower and little dialogue. Even Shaw though is merely just a man with the same vision as the soon to be Magneto which leaves him feeling cheap and recycled.<br/><br/>The problems of characters is also prevalent on the heroes side as well. With the exception of the big four I named earlier all the other characters of the X-Men team are only given a scene or two of good characterization, in comparison to the villains though this is a treat (they actually have full sentences!).<br/><br/>Aside from the problem of too many characters for it own good ( same problem as Wolverine Origins) and at times a cheesy plot First Class handles its development of its main four people ( Raven, Eric , Charles, and Hank) skillfully. All these people are brought back in large roles in the later X-Men films which only bolsters the strength of those films as well. The action of the movie is always awesome (Magneto comes to mind for so many reasons) and at times even awe inspiring. The action wasn't in the end the factor that kept me invested in this long movie.<br/><br/>In the end it was the simple story of two men becoming friends who are torn apart by what they believe in desperately trying to change each other to see the world their way , while still holding a mutual respect for each other ( this works especially well when the film reaches its ultimate climax).<br/><br/>If you liked any of the previous X-Men movies you will like this a lot. If you've never seen the others the foreshadowing of this prequel won't have the impact it has on those who have but the movie will still be good entertainment.<br/><br/>Rating 7.8/10"
"good-decision","8","2","5","3 June 2011"," I went in thinking ""whatever"" and came out thinking ""wow""
","I went in thinking I was going to be bombarded with effects, actors who have mastered posing, the dare-devil swagger and flat catchphrases and ""attitude"".<br/><br/>I was blown away by the movie. In fact, I liked it more than Pirates of the Caribbean on Stranger Tides. I gave it 8 out of 10 because there were few issues with the movie (particularly in the writing of the characters of Beast and Raven/Mystique, and the cartoonish silly performance of Kevin Bacon -- what's with that tin helmet? LOL) But I can see where Bacon is coming from. Most superhero movies (if not all of them) are cartoonish anyway (apart from Iron Man 1 :o)). He could not see what this movie was on paper. And indeed, maybe was it not for McAvoy (Young Professor X) and Michael Fassbender (Young Magneto), and their incredible down-to-earth and real performances, the whole movie would have been plunged in a downward spiral. Thanks to them, the movie has all the depth of a drama, while it still has all the fun of action. If more sense was given to the writing of other botched characters, this movie would have been just 10/10.<br/><br/>The movie is a magnificent plethora beautiful music, credible moving stories of personal trauma and struggle, the effects are not only masterful but also awe-inspiring.. with that music.. again.. wow! The British actor (McAvoy) was perhaps my most favorite thing in the whole movie. Although again with the writing, some bits here and there were self-contradictory but nothing too noticeable.<br/><br/>As usual in this genre, the women in the movie were ""for the guys"". Needless accessories and eye candies. Although, it seems Raven (in later versions) has lost a lot of ""baby fat"". I didn't have any special moments from her to be honest, even though her character was laden with moments that were wasted.<br/><br/>Watch out for Lucas Till (Havoc, the mutant wielding his fire rings), he didn't say much in this movie but in the few seconds that meant a lot, he just nailed it. Which is more than I can say for Nicholas Hoult (Beast) who serenaded the audience with an unbelievable and rather creepy performance.<br/><br/>Lucas Till has this jittering-demon-nice-guy mix that Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, and Collin Ferrel play with very well. Let's hope he will not be lost in a long series of pretty boy movies. Pretty boys never grow up into mature men in this career."
"TheChampReview","10","2","5","3 June 2011"," The Best Xmen Adaption to date!
","Just like any other X-Men fan learning of a new movie was a bittersweet feeling. I was excited to see another story of my childhood pleasure come to life but was also inhibited of how Bryan Singer and Matthew Vaughn would translate the entire plot into an enjoyable two hour movie. For lack of a better word, I think the most appropriate word in my vocabulary is pure and utter awesomeness. I enjoyed the tact Bryan Singer implemented from the previous movies and how they tied into this one. I also enjoyed the surprising cameos. <br/><br/>It's no question that the makers of the previous of X-Men films were obvious Wolverine fanatics, so part of my disappointment with the first three films was that the plot glorified his character and back story. Wolverine was always the most important, had the most emotional depth and somehow saved the day. It was disappointing because every character's personal story is captivating in its own right. This time it was different. This time they got it right. the unveiling of each character's backstory was beautifully done and I found myself emotionally invested in the plot.<br/><br/>I found it brilliant that the plot connected itself to a true event, the Cuban Missile Crisis. I'm also a lover of villains and Kevin Bacon and January Jones did an amazing job. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender are definitely Oscar potentials because they're acting sold me from beginning to end. In the previous movies, Professor X and Magneto were just men too old to change and you accepted them that way. But it was definitely an enjoyable tale to see their friendship grow, blossom and ultimately how they became enemies.<br/><br/>I think every movie goer should know by now, that after many adaptions from novels, comics, cartoons, etc. that the film version is never going to be 100% accurate. How can a film-maker be creative if all they're doing is recycling someone else's idea??? Where's the fun in that? So if you're going to the film hoping that will be exactly like the cartoon or the comic, you will be really disappointed. My advice is to go in the theater blind, if so, you will appreciate the evidence of obvious hard work, detail and genius all the more.<br/><br/>The score was great and suitable, the costumes paid homage to the original comic and looked great. The plot and script were nicely done. Kudos to the screenwriters who captures the essence of each character without pounding us with thousands of words. The story was about Professor X and Magneto but each character definitely made their mark on the screen when it was time; from Mystique, to Beast, Emma Frost, Azazel, Pixie, Havok, Banshee, Sebastian Shaw, Riptide, Darwin, etc.<br/><br/>As I stated before they finally got it right. Just think of X-Men 1, 2 & 3 and even the Wolverine: Origins movie as practice for the product that came out June 3rd. Enjoy!"
"kgprophet","7","2","5","3 June 2011"," Dense drama is this summer's blockbuster to beat
","Comparisons can be made to Christopher Nolan's reboot of Batman, where scripting and story are refined and the genre is examined. Commonly in these types of films there are scenes of obligatory rivalry, villainy, comedy, exposition, where the dialogue is clunky and the scenario is cliché. A good example of this is the movie ""X Men Origins: Wolverine"". A good measure of a bad script is when your characters end up in a bar. The bar is the place you write your characters when you don't have any original ideas. To my memory, there are only a couple very brief scenes in a bar in XM:FC. And these sparse bar scenes are for mainly for comedic gain.<br/><br/>This dense origin script knew what central themes it was examining before it set about to make action sequences. In other words, action scenes don't exist just for the sake of action. Characters have motivations that drive the action. The only place I might fault the storyline is trying to embed itself into the Cuban Missile Crisis. The antagonist seems to have free access to anywhere and can somehow easily convince the powers that be to instigate nuclear war. Fortunately, it doesn't matter since Kevin Bacon makes a great villain. I have never been a big fan of Kevin Bacon, but he shines in certain moments, like in ""Mystic River"" or ""Animal House"". Here he is allowed to be creepy in a very convincing way, almost making the extra aspect of possessing special powers unnecessary.<br/><br/>Although there is much buzz about Michael Fassbinder (I raved about him myself in my review of ""Inglorious Basterds""), I was impressed by the performance of James McAvoy. He takes on the persona of a younger Sherlock Holmes. He is convincing when he puts his fingers to his temple in order to project his mind. This type of activity could easily come across as silly if not approached properly. The Magneto character without much surprise is as strong as Darth Vader in screen presence. The audience almost trembles as Magneto occupies the screen, ready to get angry at his past.<br/><br/>One thing about this tentpole film is that it resembles the original X Men film, where emphasis was placed on character instead of action. Both these films have limited action sequences. It is actually refreshing to not require some over-the-top CGI to have a good time during the summer blockbuster season. Case in point is the noisy ""Transformers 2"", where it was just meaningless nonstop destruction. The director Matthew Vaughn infused elements of his strong film ""Kick Ass"" into XM:FC. There are scenes where teenagers work out together their issues, sometimes not knowing if their choices are the right answer. Teenage struggles work as a metaphor with having special powers. They struggle with their identity, deal with sexuality, and personal appearance. It takes very dedicated script writing to flesh out the large number of characters being juggled around in this story. Much credit must go to the screenplay writer, even though Bryan Singer wrote the story.<br/><br/>The music by Henry Jackman is hardly original, it borrows heavily from the memorable soundtrack of ""Inception"", including the use of guitar to add texture to the pulsing strings, etc. Perhaps big summer films require the wall-to-wall bombastic music to carry the momentum, and I won't deny it works. But you sometimes wonder if this is a situation where the editor puts temp music in, in this case ""Inception"", and the director gets married to it. This diminishes the ability for the soundtrack composer to come up with something unique. It even sounds like Jackman hired Johnny Marr again to do the guitar.<br/><br/>As for the direction, there is a lot that could have gone wrong. There is a fine balance with story pacing. You want to keep the momentum going without losing the beats necessary to establish emotion. Again, this is done to perfection in Nolan's Batman series. In XM:FC the intelligence of the main characters comes across with very competent acting. So Vaughn should be commended for getting good performances from his cast. I expect to see this film again, primarily because it has so many characters with their arcs, that I need another viewing to take it all in. All the mutants introduced in this film are given situations that are explored. The special effects are top notch, except for a couple iffy wide shots, but they are not distracting. Speaking of not distracting, I am glad the producers didn't try any hokey 3D conversion for this flick."
"cdg89","10","2","5","3 June 2011"," The Best So Far
","It was a toss up tonight - Hangover 2, Pirates 4 or X-Men Pre-Prequel.<br/><br/>I wasn't particularly drawn to one over the other. <br/><br/>I loved Hangover, but beauty of the original was that it was so unexpected. Not sure the second can deliver on that. And as for pirates, well who doesn't love to escape to the beauty of a tropical locale every once in a while. X-men I wasn't sure about. The previews seemed to just show Charles X and Magneto chatting, which isn't too bad considering how lovely McAvoy and Fassbender are, but beyond that it did not seem very exciting.<br/><br/>Leave it to my husband to settle the matter. Strolling in from golf he glanced at the paper and said, ""X-Men First Class is out? Let's go!""<br/><br/>I was hooked from the opening scene. This is the best X-Men so far. I absolutely loved every minute of it!<br/><br/>The movie has all the great points of the other X-Men films, excitement, action, tension of one side against the other, fascinating mutant characters, excellent fx and great story/back-story and tie-ins; but it is the interaction and dialog between McAvoy and Fassbender and acting of Kevin Bacon that seal the deal. They are simply a pleasure to watch. At 2 hours, the length is perfect. It gives you all you want from the movie and stops at the precise moment it might begin to drag. <br/><br/>It is not often that at the end of a movie my husband and I simultaneously turn to one another, smile, hold hands and say, I really liked that. X-Men FC was an unexpected treat, one I highly recommend."

","I went in to the film thinking this should be good but came out thinking this it the best x-men film yet. For me it showed all the hidden clues in to how some of the Major things came about including seribro which I would never of guessed Hank made. The characters were amazing and showed just how much Charles and Eric cared for each other and certainly there chosen paths. I can't say how brilliant the special effects were because they were to amazing to even comment on. I found the ending heart breaking and the humour very funny and I can not weight for the next one nor wait for it to come on DVD. It ticked all the boxes: great acting,funny,action-packed,moving, mind blowing,unforgettable movie. Is definitely a classic in my eyes. I would suggest watching or reading some sort of x-men before seeing it other wise some bit may not be as amazing as if you know what they are. Overall definitely worth seeing and seeing again and again"

","Don't get me wrong I love the first three X-Men movies, and have read the comic books since forever.<br/><br/>However, this film was technically brilliant, character driven and restrained. The action was perfectly paced and scaled, and totally believable; which given what some of the characters can do is hard to achieve.<br/><br/>Plenty of nods to the likes of James Bond. A perfectly observed period piece that just works on every level. It is a shame that the Academy will not even look sideways at this film, which would be a total crime.<br/><br/>A must-see comic book movie from a die hard comic book fan. This is up there with The Dark Night."
"SillyRaccoon","9","2","5","2 June 2011"," One of the best X-Men films out of the series! *SOME SPOILERS*
","When i first heard that this movie was being made (Like Most X-Men fans) I was not entirely excited about this being made but as time went on and they started releasing publicity shots and mini trailers my anticipation grew. I went to the cinema last night and if i'm honest i was going without having the highest of expectations but after watching this boy was i blown away! The cast was absolutely perfect and the time between action and drama was spot on. The cameos that were chosen were great too with the typical Wolverine attitude which actually had the whole theatre laughing their heads off. There was lots of laughs when Mystique suddenly aged into the future Mystique. My only criticism of the movie was that some of the characters in the movies powers were not shown off enough. But still there really was a good amount of action as well as ""deep"" scenes where we learn about the characters. It was a shame that we didn't get to see more of Edi Gatheg as i think he's a fantastic actor. Michael Fassbender was fantastic as Magneto. Overall i was thoroughly impressed and i am hoping to see a sequel in the pipeline as soon as possible. I would highly recommend people to go and see this."
"sampersonthing","9","2","5","1 June 2011"," The best of the series
","Since X-men 3 was a bit disappointing, I was a little apprehensive about watching this, even with Matthew Vaughn directing. Luckily, it proved to be worth the £10 I payed (particularly with it not having 3D which made a nice change).<br/><br/>One thing I was keen to spot was continuity with the other films, and for the most part it was very accurate, though the ending did not fit in with Xavier's paralysis occurring about 20 years too early (You see him walking in a flashback in X3 which is set a good 20 years after first class).<br/><br/>Aside from that, I found the film to be an incredibly enjoyable and rewarding experience. The actors chosen worked well, particularly with James McAvoy playing a younger Xavier. There was a good balance between character development, action and the odd bit of humour, particularly from a memorable Cameo.<br/><br/>All in all, this is easily the best of the X-Men series, with an engaging and well thought out storyline and some brilliant effects and cinematography.<br/><br/>A must see!"

If i am honest i didn't really expect a a lot from this movie because of the different cast but it was truly amazing and just fantastic. There is probably one face in there that you will recognize at one point in the movie i really didn't think it was who it was but it was. This film is definitely a ten out of ten what i thought made it really really good was the different types of mutants in it and also the younger mutants and how some parts out of x-men 1,2 and 3 is finally out and shows you how it happens and that and it is just truly amazing."
"babco100","6","3","10","5 June 2011"," Just not that good
","I went in to this movie with pretty confident that I would be enjoying this movie. I'm not going to go as far as to say this movie was bad, but I found myself constantly waiting for something more. When you're just going to do a 'reboot' or 'reinvention' or whatever you want to call it, you don't need to go way the hell out of the way just making stuff up. Star Trek did a great job of keeping it simple. XMen-First Class is way too long. The key is doing more with less. You lose flow to the movie when you have these scenes that drag on and on trying to build up these relationships, that fans of the comic should assume already. <br/><br/>Again, this movie wasn't bad, but it could have been a lot better. I recommend waiting until DVD to see this. It sets up well for other movies, but overall it was way too long and had too many corny scenes. Acting by the younger crowd was less-than-stellar."
"artful_mark","6","3","10","3 June 2011"," The Freshmen 15: too many characters, too little development
","Read on to get *spoiled* on XFC! As a decades-long fan of X-Men, here is what I noticed. I do recommend seeing the film. Great intro. Shaw's and Erik's spot-on German gave me high hopes for the kind of intricately cultural world the X-Men can be. Then it kind of went downhill. The White Queen, here just Emma Frost, was listless and bland. She had no sarcastic and droll dialogue, she was ""top-heavy"" with not enough rump to back up her legendary figure, and her face was kind of chipmunky instead of drop-dead ice gorgeous. Azazel, the character I was most interested in getting to know, may as well have been made of cardboard, he said almost nothing and we learned nothing about him in this film. Ditto tornado-guy (never got his name until the credits~ ""Riptide""). The biggest plot let down for me was Shaw having the helmet we see later in the series for Magneto. I had assumed that the metal surrounding Magneto's head allowed him to create magnetic fields so strong Xavier couldn't penetrate them. Guess anyone can have a metal head with the same effect (oh, wait, how does the Prof read Wolvie's mind?) Anyhow. There are so many other characters that get so little treatment personality-wise, it's almost like flipping through a deck of cards. Angel~Banshee~Darwin~Havok. We just assumed they joined the CIA team because they were asked- very thin motivation. Mystique, Beast and of course Eric and Charles fare much better. Erik is my fav performance in the film, handily beating Charles in the charisma field. His accent kind of flows into a Scottish tinged mess at the end. I was very pleased with the special effects. All were top-notch, but did little to quell bland team development. I kept waiting for Magneto to help Charles build Cerebro, or at least re-build it. Highlights were fun cameos by Wolverine and the original Mystique/Raven. Abysmal and totally taking me out of the film was Moira McTaggart. She had no accent, no discernible culture of any kind, and played a generic hot CIA-agent (?) The original Moira in her cameo in X3 had more gravitas in one scene than this one in the whole film. The one character I was surprised by was Darwin, and was disappointed he didn't ""survive"" very well. Allegiances shifting at the end seemed kind of stiff. The music was often heavy-handed. The White Queen SHOULD have knocked this movie out of the park, and was the biggest writing/casting misstep. Beasts feet kind of grossed me out, but once he furballed, he was cute. Beast did more in one-week than seems possible: Fashion maven, courtier, rocket scientist, chemist, physicist, psychic ""brain surgeon"", etc., but it was neat having him around. I'm not salivating for the second installment, but will watch it. XFC suffered from the Freshmen 15, it could stand to trim up and get serious about studying..."
"adrianip77","6","3","10","2 June 2011"," Reasonable effort, not on par with the original 2 movies.
","X-men has always been a bit odd to me. Lots of characters and powers can always make for a fun time, but also for the potential to get too caught up in this side of things rather than strong character development and storytelling.<br/><br/>The other side of it is that for me X-Men has also always been a kind of halfway house between the dark, adult themed batman reboots and the popcorn and cheesy grins of spiderman, I think the original 2 movies of the series carried this off very well with a good mix of decent acting (Patrick Steward, Ian McKellen) vs the more fun elements with wolverine, rogue and a decent interplay between characters like wolverine and cyclops.<br/><br/>Unfortunately a lot of these elements are lacking in the new movie, it's definitely an enjoyable film, but leaning considerably towards the cheesy popcorn style with occasional efforts at character development. Perhaps I was unreasonable in my expectation, but I loved the first two movies (not so much the two after that) and I was really hoping this would get back to that sort of standard, which it doesn't.<br/><br/>The original X-Men movie left me desperate for X2, unfortunately having seen First Class, I'm not that bothered about wanting to see ""X-Men: Sophomore Year"", and that is quite a disappointment."
"xamtaro","8","3","11","2 June 2011"," Forget Wolverine, THIS is the X-men prequel done right.
","X-citing, X-travagent and X-tremely entertaining, X-men First Class explodes into theaters with a coming of age tale that digs deeper than your usual special effects laden blockbuster. Here is a rare creature, a prequel that may easily be one of the few that can hold their own against their original films. If the insipid X-men Origins Wolverine left a bad taste in the mouth, X-men First Class returns to the roots of what made the original X-men such a hit in the comic book world. Roaring adventure tales with lovable characters; epic in scope yet filled with heart and spirit.<br/><br/>One complaint against the otherwise excellent X-Men films by Bryan Singer was that it was less of an ""X-men"" film and more like a Wolverine film guest starring the X-men. First Class corrects that mistake and delivers a true ensemble film that gives ample development to all its main characters. Ironic that for the film which perfectly captures the team dynamic and chemistry of ""X-men"", it is not based on any one particular X-men comic title, not even the similarly named series ""X-men: First Class""(the comic).<br/><br/>The movie works purely as a prequel set largely during the 1960s Cuban missile crisis. Before becoming Magneto the master of magnetism, Erik Lensherr was a bitter mutant seeking vengeance against the Nazi officer, Sebastian Shaw, who tortured him and killed his mother. Before he was professor X, telepathic Charles Xavier was a suave, wavy haired University graduate who, along with his adopted shape shifting sister, Raven, are put to work by the CIA to track down the infamous leader of the Hellfire club who so happens to be the Sebastian Shaw Erik is seeking. A fateful turn of events brings these unlikely individuals together and the discovery of Shaw's plans of nuclear war inspires the establishment of a team of mutant agents to end this crisis. Together, Xavier, Erik and Raven recruit a team of young adult mutants, each with their own powers, quirks and insecurities about their place in the world.<br/><br/>As the film moves along its brisk pace, the motivations, perspectives and unique personalities of each character are adequately fleshed out within a limited period of time. Themes of racism, alienation, extremist idealism and discovering one's calling in life, all themes inherent in the X-men comics and past movies, are explored. Tragic turn of events inevitably lead to questioning of one's allegiance and most courses of action that the characters take come very naturally, their reasons implied through dialogue and subtle cues . Audiences more used to explicit exposition and explanation for characters' motivations might feel that some of the characters' actions made little sense. Rest assured, it is all implied within the narrative but never feel at the forefront due to the film's pace.<br/><br/>Already at a whopping 131 minutes, X-men First Class does feel rushed only because it tries too hard to develop all the main characters. While each of them do undergo significant changes and growth by the end, this comes at the price of underdeveloped villains and a story that hops all over the world with no sense of a time frame; one moment, This leads to some avoidable plot holes especially in the middle and later parts of the film. And on the subject of time, this movie is meant to be set in the 1960s. However, aside from some old computers and archival footage of President Kennedy, nothing else feels like it fit in that era. The look of the various locales, the way the characters speak, even the clothing have an obvious 2000s feel.<br/><br/>Not that there is anything wrong with how the characters speak. The writers bring a snappy rhythm and youthful beat to the dialogue, enhanced many fold by the excellent performances and impeccable chemistry of the actors. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender who play Charles and Erik respectively manage to channel the nuances of the roles previously played Patrick Stewart and Ian Mckellen. As a result, their characters feel familiar for the long time fans yet fresh to newcomers to the franchise. The only black mark on the script is the mandatory romantic subplot involving Raven, Hank and Erik which felt like it was put in there as an afterthought.<br/><br/>After two disappointing X-men movies, ""evolution leaps forward"". Compared to the other X-men films, X-men First Class out shines both X-men 3 and X-men Origins: Wolverine. One could regard this movie as almost on par with the first, delivering pure entertainment in the action but never forgetting its heart in the characters. It is easily accessible to new audiences while those who have watched the previous X-men movies will thrill at the many connections and references made. With a sequel already being planned, the X-men movie franchise is finally getting the jump start it needs.<br/><br/>http://thexamtaroshowvault.blogspot.com/"

","""X-Men: First Class"" manages to not only include some pretty awesome mutants but Matthew managed to make the main focus of the film about the story, and yet still let the film be about the origins of X-Men. At first I thought, OK, enough about the 1960's and more about the mutants but eventually I came to love how the focus was on the conflict of Russia and America and how easily the mutants fitted into it. The characters were greatly explored, especially Magneto because you understand why he is who he is and that really he is not really evil but just full of anger and grief. Xavier was pretty cool and you see how he ends up in a wheelchair. Also Mystique was a great character was was explored really well. A great movie for all to see!"

Mystique is whiny and annoying, and Erik is your typical angsty fellow looking for revenge. Nothing about this movie was too exciting, except for some of the action scenes. <br/><br/>And let's not forget the loads of homo-erotic subtext. Even before, ""Oh Erik, thank you for sharing that beautiful memory with me,"" I thought Charles and Erik were going to start making out at any minute. Their faces are literally 4 inches away from each other when they talk and all their dialog sounds like they're flirting with each other. ""Bromance"" is an understatement. <br/><br/>I was surprised to find out this movie was written by the same guys who wrote ""Thor,"" because I really enjoyed that movie. The only redeeming quality about this movie is the fact that most of the actors and gorgeous.

Many were still sitting in their seats after all the credits rolled, which is rare, from my experience. The music was good. It certainly helped to make the movie. It was clear that money went into this version. Seeing James McAvoy take the lead in an action flick since ""Wanted"" was good. Playing more of the thinking man suited him. Michael Fassbender held up well to the twists and turns of his character and what made him tick. Yet it was a real pleasure to see the un-aging Kevin Bacon as the villain in this one. His version of Sebastian Shaw was chilling. It was too bad that his character had to come to and end, but with this franchise, who's to say? There were also nice, brief scenes that were eye catchers, such as Hugh Jackman. I was pleased to see Michael Ironside playing the Captain. There was stirring in the movie theatre, so perhaps others recognized him from ""Starship Troopers"" or ""V"" (the 1980's original series), or other sci-fi. Rose Byrne kept us grounded as the ""normal"" person hanging out with the mutants. It turns out that it was through her research that she was able to pull together the x-men. While Xavier was using cerebro, it was eye-catching to see all of the possible mutants out there. One seemed to be a young Storm. Another kick were the 1960's sets. Shaw's living room really hit the nostalgia mark with the sunk-in living room and cozy fireplace. January Jones stood out as Emma Frost. She made a tough dynamic duo to Shaw's incredible powers. It was clear that the movie-goers were ready to see more when the credits rolled. It will be fun to see the next venture of X-Men.

The story is very well-written and the acting is very good all around. And the big action set-piece is just long enough and is the perfect climax for all the story lines throughout the movie. Plus the action is actually really cool, unlike Iron Man. The team aspect of the X-Men is capitalized upon during the climax, and it's awesome. The special effects are good enough, but won't blow your mind or anything. It might be a tad too long, but overall it's well-cast and well-paced, and most importantly, it reinvigorates the X-Men film franchise after The Last Stand and Wolverine had almost eliminated any goodwill it had left. Matthew Vaughn and everyone else involved with adapting the story deserve a ton of credit for this hugely entertaining film."
"cm_anon76","8","2","6","3 June 2011"," Crocodile Tears
","I thought this was mostly a well written movie. It's a story about mutants and humans. Some mutants want to live with humans. Some want to kill them. It's also about the cold war and organizations like the CIA.<br/><br/>Oddly, the movie seems to agree with the villains, and shows humans in a very negative light. The only good humans in the movie are CIA agents. That's right. The only two ""good"" humans are spies. In the comics, Moira MacTaggert was a brilliant scientist, but in this movie she's a spy.<br/><br/>In addition, organizations like the CIA are painted with broad strokes as being close-minded organizations. It's hard to imagine why an organization who recruits the best and the brightest and is constantly adapting to situations around the world, like the CIA, is close minded. It's an ignorant view. It's a bigoted view.<br/><br/>The movie seems to justify the villains at the end. Mystique tells Beast to have ""mutant pride"" before she leaves. Charles Xavier even kisses her goodbye.<br/><br/>But it still was a well written movie. There weren't much special effects or eye candy though. It lacked feeling. The most exciting part of the movie was when Banshee was flying. The scenes with Azazel were no where near as interesting as Nightcrawler in the second movie. They also mispronounced Azazel's name dozens of times throughout the whole movie.<br/><br/>Maybe they should have split this into two movies, so they would have had more time to explore the characters feelings.<br/><br/>Before seeing this movie I was disappointed that they didn't have the original first class (Beast, Angel (male), Cyclops and Jean Gray). But the kids in this movie has so little screen time that I'm almost happy they didn't have the original characters.<br/><br/>It also didn't bother me that Kevin Bacon looked nothing like Sebastian Shaw. He had the attitude, and that's all that really matters I guess. I also didn't mind that they changed his powers, except for the part where he killed that guy by just touching him. That was just too easy.<br/><br/>I was glad they showed the White Queen (Emma Frost) as being a powerful telepath. I didn't think it was necessary to show her in diamond form. I think the whole diamond idea is stupid."

","After the original three movies and the Wolverine movie, I just couldn't see the point in yet another bloated, melodramatic feature film that would in almost all likelihood be nothing but following Wolverine around as flat characters milled about him doing things with superpowers to other things with superpowers. The promotional stuff for First Class did little to change my mind. Then I heard it was going to be something of a franchise reboot and my interest was piqued.<br/><br/>I went into the film with the expectations of seeing a mediocre movie and I came out blown away and quickly having every reason to consider X-Men First Class my favorite of all the Marvel movies so far.<br/><br/>The story is rich and multi-layered, covering an amazing amount of ground in the time they have and never having it negatively impact the flow. Its not a cheesy superhero movie plot, that's for sure. And there's certainly no cases of a supervillain having a master plan of turning a politician into a goo monster for kicks.<br/><br/>I can not praise the cast enough though. The range the actors showed was amazing. Hank McCoy being a perfect example of this. Going through a distinct personality change due to circumstances without it being ""hit you over the head with a folding chair"" blatant.<br/><br/>The writing, oh the writing, especially the dialogue was delicious. The character interaction were natural and believable and outside of a couple of iffy places, the dialogue was refreshingly free of preachy, over-dramatic speeches about morality and acceptance and clichéd monologuing.<br/><br/>Suffice to say, this movie is responsible for me starting to have a wee bit of faith in Hollywood again!"
"trantor2nd","9","2","6","3 June 2011"," Best of the franchise
","Best X-Men movie I've watched. That's even going in with the high expectations borne from the exceptional reception from critics. I enjoyed it more than Thor, which my wife (not a comic book fan) enjoyed more. The story line could easily have been the planned ""X-Men Origins: Magneto"". Many comic book characters introduced, though much were just background fodder. Make-up effects of the blue Beast still leaves much to be desired. Maybe they should have made him CGI. Now I am certain director Vaughn's Kick-Ass wasn't just a fluke. Both improved over his OK Stardust. X-Men comics time line was compressed for this movie, and it amazingly still works. I did not hate the third movie of the franchise like many did, but at least now they need not continue with that thread and will be busy with this one's. Good thing they didn't think of doing a 3D for this one. No extra after-credits scene here."
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","8","2","6","2 June 2011"," I'd say it earns itself a solid B
","During the Cold War, Magneto joins Xavier in an effort to stop Sebastian Shaw. This movie has the same problems as the others in the franchise... too many characters(leading to not enough development, albeit what there is can be great) and superpowers(and in this, not all of them are even used all that interestingly... Angel didn't need to be in this), if there are good introductions to both. Added are the issues of trying to rush through events in a shortened timeframe and without an excessive running time. It does work out(this keeps to a nice pace), but it doesn't establish things(such as the brotherly relationship between Erik and Charles) as well as it could if it had spread the events out over several films. Still, it fares quite well. It's unlike the others in tone, closer to a Bond flick(and not only because of the period), that happens to have mutants for operatives. It's brutal at times, with Lensherr's quest for revenge. This isn't really ""action"" as much as ""thriller"", and build-up and tension is the focus more than battles between people with abilities. The performances are strong, and the actors are well-cast. There are some memorable sequences in this, including the best flight I've seen since the original Iron Man. The humor is hit and miss. There is partial nudity(Mystique) and brief strong language in this. I recommend this to fans of the comic books and the other recent adaptations(except Origins: Wolverine and X-Men 3). 8/10"

The construction of the Cerebro and its working, further how it finds the similar ones (nice to see all of them with different power). Charles fooling the militants at the entrance. The Helmet and its logic. The huge dish moving scene that demonstrates Magnetos power. The plane logic saying it to be built by mutant (fact file: there really exists such aircraft built by humans). The coin scene and the inter battle between (mutants) that destroys missiles.<br/><br/>Cons (what I disliked): The killing of mutant who adapts to surroundings, despite the nice scenic representation.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: Currently I don't remember of any prequels better this one.

","Look sequels, prequels, spin-offs are by definition derivative. This boring sequel is no different. All the sentences about Russkies, Soviets and the CIA are meaningless and superfluous. Listen to them and it will dawn on you quickly.<br/><br/>With that said, showing the spooks being a waste of the taxpayers' money is not bad in and of itself. Moreover, Rose and Jennifer are positively hawt and all the desirable and sexy legs and thighs are evocative to any straight man like me. Even Angel is kind of a tolerable because she flaunts some.<br/><br/>In other words, this is not the original X-Men, but it is not a complete waste of time like The Farce Awakens either. At least, the girls are hot and worth it."

","So this movie does great actually, it shows us the background of our known mutants of X-Men, X2 and The Last Stand and I think they did a great job here. But I think it's questionable what they focused on in X-Men and X2 and therefore this is what they had to deal with in this prequel.<br/><br/>
The whole X-Men saga has a bit too much of a teen feeling around it imo, so it's watchable for the brighter masses and younger people and I'm not a huge fan of it. I like the special effects and parts of it and the X-Men universe has great potential, but I'm not fully sold on the whole franchise yet. I actually think Origins:Wolverine was one of the best X-Men movies since it felt more mature. I yet have to watch all of the franchise, still missing some of the puzzles. I have hopes in 'Logan' !"
"basyaehrman","8","1","2","27 April 2018"," Very good, but flawed
","In essence this is a great film. Good script and really swell acting - all very well cast, specifically Xavier and Eric. Plus, a few unexpected story lines and character arcs. Fight scenes that made sense - like two flying mutants (though with different abilities) fighting in the air. There was a lot of international touches that made it authentic. <br/><br/>Honestly, for someone just getting introduced to X Men, this would make a great first film to watch. It explains mutations and how to develop them (in the school in previous films, we've only seen them learn history and language arts etc) and you really get to see the mutants improving their skills. <br/><br/>However: I'm tired of the trope that it's wrong to kill someone who's going to hurt other people. Nazis, and their doctors who experiment on people, deserve death and worse. There's no need to spare them and pretend it's kindness. And if someone kills someone who's about to start a nuclear war, they're a hero not a monster. And Xavier should have known that ""they're just following orders"" is the wrong excuse, especially to a broken concentration camp survivor. <br/><br/>Also, Beast's face was subpar. Not good. And Magneto in a cape?<br/><br/>Lastly, the continuity with other X Men films is bad. For example, from the first trilogy, I'd never have realized how close Xavier and Mystique once were. But on the plus side, this film is really good at showing how Eric and Mystique's relationship developed, as well as Eric and Xavier's - that's one of its greatest accomplishments, although I expected them to have been friends for many years, not months. On the down side, as much as it showed how the mutants became themselves - Eric's story was better than I could have hoped - it's hard to imagine from this that Eric would one day abandon Mystique in a truck, because she lost her mutation. Another glaring lack of continuity is that previous films showed an adult Xavier walking, but here he lost use of his legs way younger. <br/><br/>Still, if you can ignore all that, it is a well done film I enjoyed watching."

","Alongside Days of Future's Past these are the best X-Men films with great music score. All of the characters are given a role and not just Logan, the Professor and Magneto. Seeing Beast is excellent as he is finally given more screen time. This movie gets the X- Men done correctly. Each of the team brought together are allowed to develop. The villain is not the most important part of the story and so does not take away from what is a story ultimately about the X-Men team. Using their powers to solve problems and actually showing scenes in which the X-Men are coming to terms with their abilities. Their actually shown as mutants with human frailties."

I love the insight into Eric's past and how his tragic upbringing factors into the movie as a whole. Jennifer Lawrence was, in my opinion, a much better Mystique than Rebecca Romjin. Rose Bryne's performance was alright but I don't understand why she was needed in the movie. January Jones was an alright Emma Frost. Nicholas Hoult was a much better Hank McCoy and Beast compared to Kelsey Grammar. Sebastian Shaw was a very weak villain and Kevin Bacon's performance didn't convince me either.<br/><br/>It was a nice and interesting origin story that neatly introduces the past of the X-Men and restarted the entire franchise. An impeccable ending that perfectly finished the film. The way it explores Eric's tragic past and uses that in the story was very interesting. I also adored the setting of the Cuban Missile Crisis and though it was a genius pull for the movie. It doesn't focus on Wolverine which was a pretty prominent flaw for the original trilogy, to me.<br/><br/>The cinematography was nice and decent. It worked well.<br/><br/>The effects were awesome and badass and really benefited the movie. Some of them also genuinely looked realistic and plausible. <br/><br/>The action scenes in this movie were awesome and were just really enjoyable. There was both appropriate humour/foreshadowing and appropriate dramatic scenes that worked really well. This movie also introduces a whole host of new and interesting characters while still remaining a key few and uses them in a juggling act so complex but does it so well.<br/><br/>The music was pretty decent.

","I once heard that 'X-Men First Class' was supposed to be the least comic-booky movie in the franchise. If this was indeed the aim for the film, it failed miserably. I have never seen an X-movie this campy.<br/><br/>True, it's better than 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine', but that is the only thing I can say in its favor. The sets, the characters, the costumes, the effects and most of all the story were BAD.<br/><br/>I think they tried to bring in the cheerfulness from the Spider-Man trilogy and the MCU, but... no. This didn't work.<br/><br/>The only good stuff was the part in which Magneto hunts down his old Nazi-enemies. Probably some left overs from the 'Origins: Magneto' script, proving it a shame that they didn't go along with that movie. The Magneto movie would have been great.<br/><br/>In 'First Class', we see beloved characters Banshee, Emma Frost, Sebastian Shaw, Havok, Moira MacTaggert and Beast having little to do with their counterparts from the source material. Major plot points such as how Xaviers turns cripple and characters changing sides were abrupt with no build-up what so ever.<br/><br/>The final fight was huge. Too huge. There were so many missiles, it stopped making sense. As little sense as the bad guys plan to create a war.<br/><br/>After this movie, 'The Wolverine' and 'Days of Future Past' came out. Not without their flaws, but at least proving that good X- Movies can still be made. But First Class... well, it's better than 'Origins', but still no good. It's the X-version of Batman & Robin."

","In X-Men: First Class we meet Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr before took the names Professor X and Magneto, they were two young men discovering their powers for the first time. Before they were enemies, they were closest of friends, working together, with other Mutants (some familiar, some new), to stop the greatest threat the world has ever known. In the process, a rift between them opened, which began the eternal war between Magneto's Brotherhood and Professor X's X-MEN.<br/><br/>I can't praise the cast enough of this movie enough here. Especially Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence and McCavoy, but for me the star of the show is Kevin Bacon. He is delightfully devious. He is always reliable, but here he is truly awesome. Oliver Platt also deserves special mention too.<br/><br/>Prequels that totally recast popular characters are always on shaky ground, but given the talent involved, I'm not surprised this found an audience. <br/><br/>X-Men: First Class is a highly professional piece of work, swift and suspenseful, with a good sense of pace and atmosphere it makes for almost perfect entertainment."

One good movie could rejuvenate the franchise; instead we got a fantastic movie. The acting stood out, especially Michael Fassbender's performance as a young Magneto. I was immediately invested in the story and captivated by the progression of Magneto's character. I thought this was done very well. X-Men: First Class is not your typical summer blockbuster; it's got more layers to it. For one, the script is witty and effective. I found myself on the edge of my seat just waiting for the very well written dialogue. Another merit this film carries is the amazing soundtrack composed by Henry Jackman. It was evident that Hans Zimmer had his fingerprints all over it, for the music sounded similar to Inception, which is never a bad thing. Watching all my favorite X-Men characters when they were young was really cool, and just makes this film all the more special to me. I would rank this film among the greatest superhero/comic book movies ever made."
"BA_Harrison","7","1","2","31 May 2014"," First class? Not quite...
","A prequel designed to pave the way for the franchise retcon of Days of Future Past, X-Men: First Class charts how Professor X (James McAvoy) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender) meet and become friends, enlist fellow mutants to form a special team, battle against ex-Nazi megalomaniac Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon), and ultimately part company on bad terms after an accident leaves Xavier paralysed from the waist down.<br/><br/>On a good day, I would have declared X-Men: First Class to be a hugely enjoyable superhero romp; unfortunately, I recently re-watched X-Men 2 and saw Days of Future Past earlier this week, both of which are so good that this one actually seems quite disappointing in comparison. McAvoy and Fassbender excel as the younger versions of Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellern, the lovely Jennifer Lawrence lights up the screen as Mystique, and the special effects are top notch, but the story seems less involved than the aforementioned X-Men films, while Matthew Vaughan's handling of the material is nowhere near as stylish or sophisticated as that of Bryan Singer.<br/><br/>It's perhaps a bit harsh on a film that essentially serves its purpose, but having been spoilt by the excellence of Singer's entries in the franchise, I now expect much more from my X-Men.<br/><br/>7/10, which is not bad, but still the lowest rating that I have given to any of the X-Men films I've seen so far (The Wolverine being the only one I have yet to watch)."

","A franchise reboot reminiscent of the franchise that had been going downhill since The Last Stand, here comes a movie that is still fast, fresh and fun. <br/><br/>At the heart of First Class is the story of how close friends become bitter enemies and of how Charles and Erik become Professor X and Magneto. This is the highlight of the movie as Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and Erik Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender) meet, become friends, and then turn against each other due to their different ideologies.<br/><br/>As for the supporting cast... it was pretty promising (for the most part). Kevin Bacon brings his acting chops to the test, and he delivers almost every scene with charm, personality and charisma. Bacon makes effortless a larger-than-life role that evolves from guffawing Nazi sadist to slick Bondian baddie. Jennifer Lawrence adds vulnerability to the character who would become Mystique, as well as Nicholas Hoult as a pre-mature Beast. These two had great chemistry together. Rose Bryne as Moira, a CIA agent that helps the mutants, also does a great job in being a human interacting with mutants. And lastly, January Jones as Emma Frost, was a great addition to the team. While comic book purists may not like her character, in my opinion, she did a great job in being a part of the villains. <br/><br/>Strangely, it's the rest of the supporting cast who feel underplayed. The rest of the mutants are denied a back-story - and in the cases, any real dialogue between the rest of characters. They are defined by their powers, and not by their characters.<br/><br/>Fortunately, there's a lot more going on than character development. I really liked that it was a mixture of a spy movie and an action/adventure movie. The action is pretty crisp and clean, and I was actually invested in it. The climax is a lot of fun, especially with what they can get away with, showing all the mutants and the powers they have learned to control.<br/><br/>This movie reminds me a lot of why I liked the Singer films (who is back in the fold as producer). Marvel and mixes it with Bond and Batman, bromance and coming-of-age angst to create a cool, character-driven actioner with a social conscience that's something to be proud of.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: It's a classy addition to the X-series that expertly establishes a hoard of characters, navigates a Cold War plot and squeezes a tear for a friendship failed. Dream-team casting and quality FX make this a great movie."
"athena24","5","1","2","25 May 2014"," Very very rushed.
","Matthew Vaughn doesn't have the class of Brian Singer. X-men: first class is not the worst installment (I would honor X-Men origins: Wolverine with this title) but considering the standards set by the first two X-Men movies, it is quite a flop.<br/><br/>Aside from repetitive patterned script, stupid moments and inconsistencies regarding the previous installments it tried to close all loose ends and to explain everything. It seems that the writers (one of which is the director) didn't have the long vision. They didn't think about spanning some of the events on several movies, building relationships so when they break them, it would be believable. <br/><br/>Instead, everything is thrown at once. How Charles and Erik meet, how Erik/Magneto becomes the bad guy, Charles' injury (and more pieces on Beast and Mystique). So, considering the plot and the large portion of action, there is not much depth in the friendship of Erik and Charles. And worst of all is that half of these loose end closing occurs at the last 10 minutes. So it seemed very rushed and unbelievable.<br/><br/>The bright spot is the majority of the cast. McAvoy and January Jones were very good. Fassbender is absolutely fantastic."
"CowherPowerForever","9","1","2","22 May 2014"," Erik, I believe. I prefer............. Magneto.
","So in the year 2011 X-Men got a prequel movie, once thought to be a reboot, but as we now know the upcoming Days of Future Past takes place in the same timeline as the original X-Men films. To me that is a cop out because First Class didn't so as well as it could have at the box office. Moving on to talk about this film, First Class in its prequel nature is amazing, well acted, great action, and just downright fun. In my opinion it is the best prequel or reboot so far in the superhero genre.<br/><br/>The film was directed by Matthew Vaughn who had just finished up filming the 2010 smash hit, Kick Ass. Vaughn brings amazing skills to this film. Usually in a film like like the CG is overused. Not so much in in this film in my opinion. Sure there are uses of CG in the bigger scene, but that is expected in a film like this. However this film is a more character driven story so the CG was toned down nicely for the film. While this film lacks that amazing battle scene this genre is use to seeing it doesn't really bring down the film. Prequel films can be slower, and while that is true of this film, you cannot help but love the characters. The acting makes that all stick. From the top to the bottom this film is very well acted. Michael Fassbender as Erik Lensherr(later becomes Magneto) steals every scene he is in. James McAvoy as Charles Xavier is a delight to see as this character. He makes the role his own no doubt about it. The only real down spot of the acting is of course the average at best actress, January Jones. Thankfully her scenes are short, not to mention her character is rather cold, and she is best at playing those types of roles.<br/><br/>The film was written by Ashley Miller, Zack Stentz, Jane Goldman, and Matthew Vaughn. All of these writers had past experience writing in the superhero genre. As I mention above this story is character driven and doesn't really rely on too much action. Yet surprisingly they were able to keep your attention so amazingly. The back story on Erik Lensherr, which drives the main storyline, is so deep and done perfectly. Without Fassbender and Bacon, I'm not quite sure how well this story would have played out. Lensherr's parents are put in a Nazi concentration camp while he is just a young boy, and Sebastian Shaw(played by Kevin Bacon) kills his mother right in front of him so he got angry enough to show off his mutant skills. This back story, as I just said is just fantastic to watch play out throughout the entire film. The writers deserve much respect for writing such a fantastic film.<br/><br/>The film was composed by Henry Jackman who just recently scored the smash hit Captain America: The Winter Soldier. He also scored Kick Ass 1 & 2. While I did enjoy the score, it wasn't amazing. The last piece we hear as the films goes to dark is just amazing stuff to hear. Frankly though the rest is just about forgettable. His score in the 2014 summer blockbuster Captain America was much better.<br/><br/>Overall this is one of the greatest superhero films ever made. The acting and the characters are perfect. Matthew Vaughn works the camera perfectly even though we do not see the normal usage of action scenes for a film like this. So with the newest X-Men movie coming out just hours from the time this review hits the internet, this is a must see movie for any fan of this genre, and all those people itching too see X-Men: Days of Future Past.<br/><br/>9/10"

Set in the early 1960's, it has a very refreshing tone to the X-Men franchise. <br/><br/>I didn't expect much out of First Class because at the time, I wasn't much of a ""X-Men"" type guy. This is the movie that made me an X-Men fan. Bryan Singer did do a good job with the first two X-Men, but Vaughn did better with First Class.

After ""The Last Stand"" (2006) and ""Wolverine: Origins"" (2009) had disappointed me, I was so happy as well as confused to hear about the beginning of a new ""X-Men"" trilogy. But then upon hearing it was going to be based on one of the more recent mini-series ""First Class"", hype necessarily followed. When also considering the abundance of super-hero movies coming out this year, ""X-Men: First Class"" was the only one I was really looking forward too.<br/><br/>Though people seemed frustrated due to the fact that a majority of recognisable characters were missing from this story, I was really happy for this movies opportunity to feature all these virtually unknown characters who are brilliant and played by confident, unknown actors.<br/><br/>The only minor problem I had was that it did not follow the ""First Class"" comic storyline, but 10 minutes in I stopped caring because the 1960's aesthetic they went for is the equivalent of a James Bond movie. The friendships plus differences between James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender as Xavier & Magneto are so engaging to watch, while Kevin Bacon was an astounding villain (Was it me or does January Jones scream ""Fembot""). Overall, the story worked well and the characters and themes the ""X-Men"" were originally made for were very present. Fear of mutants (Originally a shot at Communism), and the ingenious idea of ""Mutant-Warfare"" used during the Cuban Missile Crisis.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: Though we still got to get through ""Green Lantern"" and ""Captain America"" this year, ""X-Men"" is literally first class. 8/10."

","Charles Xavier (James McAvoy), and Erik Lensherr (Michael Fassbender) embark on the journey that brings them to their ultimate fate of being sworn enemies. Before they were enemies they were two strangers searching for answers about their mutations. Charles, and Erik are accompanied by teen mutants, including Raven (Jennifer Lawrence), Dr. Hank McCoy (Nicholas Hoult) and more fellow adolescents. Charles and Erik seek help from these young mutants to take down Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon), the leader of the Hellfire Club, a secret society that wants to dominate the world. Meanwhile, the U.S has failed so badly with operations over in Cuba, that we begin to see The Cuban Missile Crisis unfold. <br/><br/>James McAvoy was good as the soon to be Professor ""X"". I thought after seeing the trailer that his character's mutation would look the same every time he reads someone's mind. But those scenes were done with a stylish feel that was in a good way, and awesome to watch. It's because McAvoy does the hand movement very subtly, and if you don't know him, you would think he was just listening in depth to your conversation. <br/><br/>Michael Fassbender was definitely the one who out acted everyone. The fearlessness that he brought to the role of Erik was remarkable. He strikes every anger filled note with perfection. Fassbender previously had a cameo in Tarantino's ""Inglourious Basterds' and he is in one of the best scenes of the film. <br/><br/>Kevin Bacon was good, I liked his ability more than I liked his acting choices. His sidekick Emma Frost/White Queen played by January Jones is by far one of the worst actresses around right now. She plays every role with the same stiff body language and one note dialog delivery, and it becomes very irritating.<br/><br/>My favorite teen mutant was Banshee. It had nothing to do with the acting because he barely had any lines, it was his mutation that was pulled off the best. From his sonic screech and the overall presence on-screen was epic to watch. The film also has a couple of great cameos, one in particular that has a great laugh.<br/><br/>Matthew Vaughn has brought us ""Stardust"", ""Kick-Ass"", and my personal favorite ""Layer Cake"". I was actually a fan of the first two also, so I was stoked when I heard he was going to be directing this film. He pulls off almost every scene with ease. I found the first thirty minutes to be kind of dull, but then from there the film starts to pick up the pace, and gain momentum. The film was overall entertaining and worth the two hours and fifteen minutes. I give X-men: First Class an 8 out of 10."

"bob the moo","Null","1","2","30 September 2012"," Solid effects-driven blockbuster, but that's about it
","Having paid more than my fair share of inflated cinema tickets to see hyped blockbuster movies based on special effects, I'm more and more happy to wait rather than go sit in a crowded noisy room to see the latest one, which is why I decided to watch the recent X-Men reboot/prequel on DVD rather than in the cinema. I had heard reasonable things though, so I was quite looking forward to it and hoping that the franchise reboot would do more than simply move earlier in the story. I may have hoped this but of course this is not really what it does â€“ the step back in time simply presses the reset button on the characters so the writers no longer need to worry about the back-story of the previous films. This may sound cynical but this is what the film is doing â€“ not adding anything by the shift in time, just getting rid of expensive actors, messy plots and also getting viewers back into the cinema after the third film started to put them off.<br/><br/>How much of a problem is this lack of innovation? Well, to be honest, not much if you are coming to the film knowing what you're getting into. What this means is that this is not a film that is exploring characters because it wants to â€“ it is building characters because it wants to sell tickets and that is clear from the start since everything is pretty basic on the character side â€“ indeed it never feels more relaxed than when it is able to go into a montage and develop characters that way. The good side of this is that it does want to spend lots of money on special effects and mostly these are up on the screen in rather silly and overblown effects shots. The various powers of the characters are where these effects come into play and they are as variable as the powers; so in some cases the effects are impressive and add to the action of the scene â€“ in other cases no amount of effects can make the powers be good (a stripper with wings isn't a ""power"", it simply means she might get more tips). The plot does allow for plenty of good action even though the plot is pretty much the same one all the films have at their core â€“ it really doesn't do much more than provide a frame.<br/><br/>The new cast never quite get to the level of the adult equivalents, even though there is some real talent here. McAvoy and Fassbender both do solid work in their roles but they fall awkwardly between being younger as characters while also trying to have the gravitas of their previous versions. Bacon is OK but never as much of a threat as he needed to be while January Jones just strides round in her pants, presumably wondering how many years of really good turns she has to give in Mad Men before someone else will give her a good role. Lawrence, Bryne, Hoult and others are all OK in their roles but the downside of all these younger actors is that this doesn't feel like a big franchise sequel/prequel so much as it feels like a cheaper version of the proper films.<br/><br/>That said it still delivers what it needs to do â€“ which is special effects that provide value for money. The plot and characters don't offer much more than a frame for these, but they are not awful, just obvious. A solid big-budget superhero movie then, but not one that does much more than the minimum in regards plot, characters and tone."
"colm-hearne365","9","1","2","11 September 2012"," One of the best prequels ever!
","I know when it comes to prequels, you usually end up with something disappointing like Star Wars: The Phantom Menace or X-Men Origins: Wolverine. But what makes prequel so great is the acting, the cast, the directing, the script, the action, the characters and special effects all work so well together that it's hard not to watch this movie. <br/><br/>I think one of my favourite things about it is the cast, especially James McAvoy as young Professor X and Jennifer Lawrence as young Mystique and their relationships with each other. Like Charles Xavior and Raven/Mystique have a brother/sister relationship. Moira acts as Charles' love interest. Charles and Eric Lehnsherr act as good friends and companions but have different views for mutants and humans as they did in the previous trilogy. Hank/Beast and Raven kind of have a love interest for each other. Even the other minor characters have interesting relationships. Like Hank and Alex/Havoc have trouble getting along because Alex is kind of a jock and Hank is a nerd, but Alex learns to appreciate Hank for being smart and useful.<br/><br/>My favourite character in this X-Men movie is probably Professor X because he's wise and loyal and he's a good leader to the mutants and trains them well. I also really like Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique. She's a real rising star in Hollywood with other movies like Winter's Bone and The Hunger Games. But I think this was her best performance ever because I like how she portrayed Mystique as being compassionate and gentle but she also wants to be accepted in society as a mutant. I also think Kevin Bacon was a even better villain as Sebastian Shaw than Ian McKellen was as Magneto in the original trilogy because he seemed almost unstoppable. In fact, part of me is sad that they killed him off. And I also like how this movie connects with the Cold War and the Cuban Missile Crisis. I like how Wolverine made a cameo which was pretty clever. <br/><br/>After watching this movie, I can't wait for the prequel to come out in 2014, X-Men: Days of Future. Now it may not be as good as this one, but I just it will be at least decent. And I'm also looking forward to The Wolverine which is coming out next year. But hopefully it won't be as bad a X-Men Origins: Wolverine.<br/><br/>Overall, this prequel is tied with X2 as my favourite X-Men movie and also one of my favourite superhero movies and one of the best movies of 2011."
"Boba_Fett1138","7","1","2","29 May 2012"," Enjoyable within its genre.
","This movie works out as good entertainment but was it truly necessary and does it also adds something to the movie X-men franchise? Not enough, in my opinion.<br/><br/>Really, I was not opposed to the idea of a prequel/reboot for the movie series but I feel that the execution of it is lacking just a bit too much and the movie is filled with some missed opportunities and poor executions of potentially good and interesting ideas.<br/><br/>Don't worry, I liked this movie more than I didn't but the movie is receiving so much praise, while it in fact is still really such a lacking movie, that I feel that I should counterbalance it.<br/><br/>The main problem I had with this movie, concerned both the Magneto and professor X character and their relation. I never got the feeling that they were true friends, which could had given this movie and all of the other X-Men movies so much more emotional impact. Besides, I never felt that Magneto was ever a good guy. He pretty much is a rogue and dangerous person from the start on already, who never had any good or noble intentions. So it also really seems unlikely that they ever were friends in the first place, since they are driven by completely different motivations and have different goals. Their friendship should had been the key and center of this movie and something that should had been build on in future X-Men movies but the movie has far too many other distractions in it, for it to ever work out.<br/><br/>It to me also never felt like these two were the same characters, who also got portrayed by Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen in the other X-Men movies. They look nothing alike and even sound completely different. This thought constantly distracted me and prevented me from ever truly liking James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender in their roles, even while in fact they are far from bad actors of course.<br/><br/>But yes, it's simply still an enjoyable movie for what it is. It features a decent enough script, decent characters, decent action and decent entertainment in it. nothing ever truly stands out in my opinion and the movie does has its slower and weaker moments still but overall this is one fine movie to watch, if you simply want to be entertained for a couple of hours. If you are expecting this movie to add more insightful depth or emotional impact to its characters or just the series as a whole, you are wrong. In that regard this movie really doesn't add enough to the series, though it still remains a welcome addition.<br/><br/>It's also a movie that does still surprise, in some ways. One thing it really surprises with is its villain. Kevin Bacon sounds like such an unlikely choice to play a villain in a superhero movie but he often was one of the highlights of the movie and simply did a good job with his role and he seemed to be having some fun with all of it as well.<br/><br/>Also the inclusion of the some new characters and the first introduction of some character that were already familiar to the series, all are welcome additions. Most of the characters get plenty of screen time and enough action to do, so it never really feels as if some of them simply got put into the movie to fill up the screen with or to help to make the movie long enough. They all serve a purpose and with their mutant powers they also help to make an impact with their roles, on the story.<br/><br/>A bit of a pointless prequel that doesn't really add enough to the franchise in my opinion but it simply remains a fun and entertaining film, with plenty of action to enjoy as well. As a superhero flick, this movie does simply not disappoint, despite all of my criticism.<br/><br/>7/10 <br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"mrda1981","8","1","2","2 May 2012"," a.k.a Magneto: The Movie.
","Under the direction and writing of the bloke 'n' bird who brought Kick-Ass to the big screen, the ever-enjoyable X-Men franchise gets a cinematic reboot. Like a more accomplished version of the Star Wars prequels, FS depicts the origin of the mythos' primary antagonist and his agenda of mutant separatism/supremacy. The success of the whole thing rests not only on the shoulders of Mr Vaughn and Mrs Goldman, but also those of the well-chosen cast. Standouts include Nick Hoult's clever-yet-conflicted take on Beast; January Jones playing Emma Frost with an air of detached ennui; Kevin Bacon in bastardly form as Sebastian Shaw; and James MacAvoy's roguishly idealistic Professor X. There's even an amusing precision F-bomb of a cameo from a staple member of the franchise.<br/><br/>Star of the show, however, has to be Michael Fassbender's steely-yet-sympathetic take on the Master of Magnetism. With a singleminded charisma he effectively takes 'n' makes the movie his own, conveying a full range of states, ""between sorrow and serenity"". Indeed, I found myself rooting for him over the clear-cut heroes of the piece. Even his glaring awkwardness in the final scene, whilst dressed in Magneto's trademark threads, can't diminish all that leads up to it. Also, he gets the most memorable background score in the whole film.<br/><br/>Is First Class a top-tier comic book adaptation? Sure. More significantly, though, it's the first of a new subgenre within that subgenre--the supervillain flick! Enjoy..."
"t_atzmueller","8","1","2","27 March 2012"," Suspicious, weary and predetermined I saw the movie – and was surprised! Pleasantly surprised!
","The first ""X-Men"" movie from 1999 was one of the few comic-book adaptations that actually worked! The second part, almost as expected, was ""so-so"" and the third, well, best not to loose too many words. Then came the abysmal ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"", and pretty much all hope for a dignified continuation of the series was lost. Plus, the current season offered a whole squad of mediocre comic book adaptations; ""Captain America"", ""Thor"", ""The Avengers"", just to name a few of the heart- and soulless CGI-abominations that have come to your cinema these days.<br/><br/>So, expectations for a re-boot of ""X-Men"" (which, despite all nods to the original series, it is) weren't all too high; didn't even bother watching it in cinema – which turned out to be a mistake.<br/><br/>""X-Men Origins: First Class"" is the first film, that comes anywhere close to the charm of the original. The fan was generally worried about not seeing any of the original characters played, say, by Patrick Steward or Ian McKellan – they need not worry: the chemistry (the magical word in ""X-Men"" 1999) between the cast is first-rate. I didn't like James McAvoy that much in ""The Last King of Scotland"" and hadn't seen much of Michael Fassbender, other than his small role in ""Inglorious Basterds"" – here, as the future Dr. X and Magneto, they're both excellent. And Dr. X isn't even bald! Word had spread among geeks that there would be a guest-appearance of Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and Mystique (Rebecca Romijn) and the word was right. We might come to expect pretentious, predictable cameos like, say, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis appearing in ""The Expendables"". Rather, Jackman and Romijn appearances combined, last less than 10 seconds, yet are so well placed and timed; it almost made this fan applaud. Chemistry and timing; the director succeeded, where the last three parts have failed.<br/><br/>The character of Azazel, the red-skinned demon mutant, is one of the let-downs of the movie. First of all, (considering that Alan Cumming played an excellent Nightcrawler in ""X-Men 2""), there really was no need to create a duplicate in red. Sure, Azazel is Nightcrawlers biological father in the comics, giving rise to potential future story lines, but the supernatural and mutant powers didn't mix so well in on paper, and they do less so-so film.<br/><br/>Special praise would go to Kevin Bacon: his arrogant, self-sure Sebastian Shaw character (who, in the comics is often one of the blander villains), works perfect as antagonist of this film – and his demise is actually rather brutal and memorable. Bravo (again, said in a geekish tone – but, as in everything, the geek is capable of finding some faults: Bacons German accent is atrocious).<br/><br/>There was even an unexpected bonus: waiting for the extra-scene, that was not to come, I sat through the credits and noticed that the final track is actually quiet an ear-catcher. To my horror, I had to realize that this was a ""Take That"" song – pardon me, it's a Metalhead speaking, who's last words will be ""Black Sabbath Rules"". But yes, the song fit like the proverbial ""butt on the bucket"".<br/><br/>So, despite knowing that the future ""X-Men Origins II – Rise of the X-Men"" (or whatever they'll call it), won't live up to ""X-Men Origin: First Class"", I'll probably march into the cinema, hand over my eight bucks and go watch it. Damn you, Hollywood, you've conned this sucker again! 8 out of 10"
"dfranzen70","7","1","2","26 March 2012"," A surprisingly good prequel that does what it sets out to do
","This prequel to the popular series is better than I expected, especially considering class is never officially in session during the movie. It's another origin film designed to show us how the original X-Men came to be and how their founder, Charles Xavier, teamed up with Erik Lehnsherr to thwart a thermonuclear war in 1962. Along the way, we learn about the Erik's inner demons and thirst for revenge and Charles' implacable sensibility. <br/><br/>I was interested in seeing this movie not just because I wanted to know how it all began but because I was already emotionally invested in the series, having seen four X-Men movies just in the past decade or so. That's how Hollywood is getting you nowadays, you know. Make a big movie, then make a sequel, then a prequel, then a spin-off, all designed to keep you coming back, because you know each character and recognize a bit of yourself in them as well. Here, you have the dark side (Magneto) and the light side (Professor X) - much like Darth Vader and Obi-Wan Kenobi in the Star Wars films, right? A classic setup.<br/><br/>We learn that Erik, later to become Magneto, is a concentration-camp survivor who saw his mother shot to death when he could not perform his extrasensory powers to the camp commandant under duress. Now he is out to find that commander, some twenty years later. Alternatively, Charles is a ladies' man who's also exceedingly bright, working on a theses about genetics. He's a telepath and wishes to learn more about genetic mutations. His childhood friend Raven has her own mysterious powers - in her true form she is entirely blue with red hair, a striking if possibly unwelcoming figure. <br/><br/>The unifying agent that brings Erik (Michael Fassnbender) and Charles (James McAvoy) together is one Sebastian Shaw, played by an oily Kevin Bacon. Shaw's plan is to get the US and the USSR to declare war on one another, thus wiping each other out, thus (apparently) leaving only mutants, who shall inherit the Earth. Erik wants to kill Shaw; Charles simply wants to stop him. They're consistently at odds with each other as they recruit other mutants to their cause in 1962, even as Charles helps Erik break down his own barriers to harness his powers.<br/><br/>This gets the CIA involved (Rose Byrne), and then there's a well-done standoff at the US-USSR blockade showdown (you know, the Bay of Pigs) that tests the wills of everyone involved. I liked that; good action.<br/><br/>A recurring theme in the X-Men movies is the battle between being who you are (i.e., a mutant) and being accepted by society (i.e., a mutant who looks like everyone else). It's not hard to draw a comparison between being a mutant and being ""different."" Do you want to just fit in, or do you want to be your own person? Raven, aka Mystique (played to perfection by Jennifer Lawrence) isn't sure, either. Neither are some of the other mutants, leading to a schism that would later show up in each of the other films.<br/><br/>First Class isn't really anything special, but it's pleasing to the eye (both in effects and in cast choice) and keeps true to its familiar characters. It fits in fairly seamlessly with the other films. It's easy to follow, of course, and the cast does a very fine job. McAvoy seems to be getting better with each role (good thing, because he was one terrible actor when he started); Fassbender, Lawrence, even January Jones (as Emma Frost) are fine as well."
"cspcsm8188","8","1","2","21 January 2012"," X:Men First Class Reboot!
","Matthew Vaughn's treatment of the film is controlled, adhering to the script firmly which may create some flaws in the story but not so much to lose sight of the crucial Xavier-Magneto bond/rivalry. Yes, McAvoy and Fassbender are excellent in their respective roles and carry the story beyond the traditional superhero dilemmas of coping with gifts that pressure and alienate them from the rest of humanity. <br/><br/>This prequel/reboot is the best thing to happen to the X-Men franchise! The film provides riveting action, powerful drama, and an intelligent backstory to the beloved comic book mutants. The film ventures into Dark Knight territory with its darker tone and does not disappoint. X-Men: First Class is easily the best X-Men film to date!"
"reecewj","10","1","2","4 January 2012"," really bad mistake in the whole story line
","I absolutely love this film and think its ace however it has really disappointed me in one very big mistake that has been made making this film. If you notice at the end of the film professor X gets paralysed, then if you watch X-men last stand he is walking with magneeto when they are older. Its such a disappointment that you have failed to make this film fit in well with the others. For me personally it has spoilt the rest of the films and should have had more thought put into how the story would fit in with the others. I am aware that everything else fits in but this is such a poor error that should not have been made. Until I noticed this error I really enjoyed First class as I thought the characters where good and the powers they had were pretty cool but now I cant help but dislike this film knowing the massive error you have made."
"oneguyrambling","5","1","2","27 December 2011"," Sorry, but I like my super heroes a little more 'Super'.
","Here is why I think the X-Men films are the worst 'superhero-related franchise' in cinema: when you take away the pretty outfits and the cast of 'they're so hot right now' actors, you are left with a bunch of scrawny 20 somethings with the worst superhero *AHEM* mutant powers available<br/><br/>You can teleport to nearby places and pick up things? Awesome.<br/><br/>Oh your ability is to fly and emit high pitched screams? You must be annoying at parties.<br/><br/>So you're essentially a giant magnet you say? Well hide the silverware.<br/><br/>You have tiny wings and can fly and spit fireballs? Big woop. And you sound just like the screaming guy. You obviously can't go on the same team<br/><br/>The obvious side-effect of this is that in most circumstances it takes an entire group of X-Men to defeat one foe, one to distract, one to disarm and one to finish the job<br/><br/>This factor leads to the X-Men being like the grab bag of stuff at the yard sale, ""Look we know this stuff is pretty worthless and a waste of time by itself, but what if we sell you a whole bagful?""<br/><br/>(But I would defend to the death Mystique's ability to be covered by little more than a coat of blue paint – even though it serves no purpose other than being able to see her cans.)<br/><br/>A few years ago Marvel tried to spin out an origin series from X-Men one film at a time starting with Wolverine – as far as I am concerned the only remotely interesting character in the group (and this film does nothing to change that) – only they PG'd the crap out of what should be an irreverent, violent and aggressive superhero. In short they f*cked the film up.<br/><br/>They had one shot at making the cash-in side project work. And they blew it. The XBox game rocked though...<br/><br/>Wolverine is in X-Men First Class for less than 30 seconds and from memory he has but one line – two words in fact – the second being 'off'. This most minute of cameos provided me with the only chuckle in the film.<br/><br/>So where does that leave X-Men First Class? Well I'll tell you what I watched; a whole array of dumb characters being 'originated' – 100 minutes in fact – before 20 minutes of bland action featuring a tug of war with nuclear missiles that would be laughable if it weren't for the fact that it was supposed to be the climax of a big budget Hollywood blockbuster that I spent money to sit through.<br/><br/>The X-Men were not born a team of superheros, they are but genetic abnormalities who are either blessed– or cursed– with unique abilities and traits. Their own attitude to these abilities largely dictates which side they end up on.<br/><br/>There are many mutants, and they aren't all good or bad from Day 1. Thankfully there are two Main Guys who seek out others like them and make their choices like a pick up game of basketball, only with a talent pool comprising a bunch of guys and gals that should be confined to the bench.<br/><br/>The two 'Team Captains' are Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) and Charles Xavier (James McElroy). After their respective round-ups from a pool of generally one-skilled mutants the two go about training their teams. Some 'players' change sides over time, some die and some seem on the fence. Some want war, others peace. Some hate humankind, others loathe themselves.<br/><br/>Xavier aligns himself with the forces of good by co-operating with the CIA, primarily Agent McTaggert (Rose Byrne), but even the CIA aren't united in their support of mutant-kind, and in fact some would choose genocide over unification.<br/><br/>It's all really quite dull actually. So after a while of milling about trading examples of mutations they liven things up by giving each other nicknames and prepping spiffy uniforms, leading to the inevitable face off between sides that culminates in a series of 'oh that's how/why!' moments that dovetail into the character's of the first films.<br/><br/>I would also question the choice to interweave a 'costumes and powers' yarn into one of the more important and harrowing tragedies in human history, that being World War 2, more specifically the Nazi genocide of the Polish and Jews, but ultimately I don't think that the core following of X-Men are history buffs at heart, so I'll let it slide Wow that could be another mediocre X-Person! Slidey. They cruise around with the unique ability to slide a bit.<br/><br/>Awesome!<br/><br/>In fact this film and series are eerily reminiscent of Watchmen, the ridiculously over-hyped and under-realised Zack Snyder stain on cinema that was released a couple years ago. If you re-read the above stuff and replace 'Wolverine' with 'Roarschach' you wont be too far wrong.<br/><br/>Final Rating – 5.5 / 10. In reality this is passable stuff, but don't try to sell this as blockbuster entertainment. I prefer my superheroes a little more Super."
"matt_hew","5","1","2","4 December 2011"," Try Hard at Best (Vaughn Cannot Direct)
","If Matthew Vaughn was ordering desert he would order everything on the menu as well as wanting what the guy on the next table was having... and ending up with a overindulgent mess which has its nice bits but doesn't work as a dish.<br/><br/>Unfortunately he applies these methods when trying to direct movies. With Layer Cake he tried to direct a gangland film like his mate Guy Ritchie (noted he was the producer for Lock, Stock & Snatch) and just created an indulgent carbon copy. Both Stardust (which was an interesting movie) and KickAss were overindulgent and crammed full of too many elements, characters and themes trying to tick too many boxes and please anything & everything.<br/><br/>This has unfortunately been applied to X-Men: First Class.<br/><br/>So how can you mess up an X-Men movie? Given that with any comic book movie those involved have been given the story (of multiples of from the different universes etc) in both written and pictorial form it would seem all thats required is to redirect this onto the screen. Problem is that due to the rich source material available to those in movieland they seem obsessed with taking too many elements and fusing them with their own spin with the result always being a mess of a movie.<br/><br/>Throw Vaughn into the mix and its a big old mess of a movie trying too hard to be exceptional with what seems to be a very limited budget. Character choice and acting is weak with too many 'in-house' jokes about wheelchairs, going bald and an unnecessary cameo from Hugh Jackman.<br/><br/>Given that the movie stands alone and shouldn't be considered a true prequel to the X-Men movies as it is a different 'take' on the X-Men it still tries to fit into the franchise (ie. with the Jackson cameo) which again is an unnecessary try hard addition.<br/><br/>The movie trundles along jumping from one timeframe to the next –whilst at the same time jumping from one location to next with very little development in story or character leading to a disappointing conclusion (the paralysis of Prof.X which is thrown in at the end as both underwhelming afterthought which is neither accurate or required).<br/><br/>All this said it is not a bad movie – and tries harder than the lazy Wolverine Movie, however unfortunately this movie tries too hard and Vaughn needs to give it up before he ruins anymore movies."

Especially for the first hour or so of it's runtime, ""X-Men First Class"" is disjointed and everywhere - it lacks focus and drags out it's introduction too long. However, by the 2nd half, the movie has settled down and the characters have mostly come together. The strength of the cast, like the older movies, is rightfully with it's 2 leads James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender, especially McAvoy who seems to faithfully represent a young and dashing Xavier. I enjoyed almost every scene with him present. Unfortunately though Kevin Bacon's antagonist seems more mischievous than truly malevolent so the movie kind of lacks an arch-villain.

The fifth film in the X-men collection is a prequel, set forty years before X-men, as we know it. It introduces Professor Charles/Xavier and Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto past life, as their two main key characters. X-men First Class Explains how they developed their individual statuses and nicknames. Matthew Vaughn gives X-men fans the inside scoop, while creating opportunity for potential fans to get involved, as the audience and characters simultaneously discover new and existing mutant behaviour. X-men first class breaks down different forms of evolution and the repercussions their powers have on characters personal life. Nevertheless I feel Vaughn could of focused on three or four main characters, rather then introducing many new mutants who have no relevance to the other films. This could possibly confuse audiences and also make them lose interest while watching as they wait for their favourite X-men to pop up, such as Hank McCoy/Beast and Raven Darkholme/Mystique. Vaughn is successful in explaining Xavier and Magneto's ongoing rivalry, and how they become enemies, considering they started as a team. It begins in 1944, Poland, Erik Lehnsherr is only a young boy when he has to witness his mother being murdered at concentration camp, by the wicked Dr. Sebastian Shaw. Unfortunately Dr. Shaw's control is short lived, as the anger he causes Magneto increases his ability, and to Dr. Shaw's dismay he becomes uncontrollable. Vaughn also highlights Magneto's venerable side, giving audiences the chance to empathise and reason with why he is rebellious. Meanwhile in New York, fortunate Charles Xavier is living a plush, educated lifestyle when he stumbles across the mutant Raven hustling for a meal, he sympathises with her and takes her in, as she is homeless, showing from the jump off his caring and neutering character. 18 Years later, 1962, the CIA agent Moira MacTaggert discovers the existence of mutants and works alongside Dr. Shaw to try and eradicate them all. They then hire Professor Xavier to gather mutants to work for the USA government. However Xavier soon realises the evil Dr. Shaw is planning to begin a nuclear war to destroy the world and increase his power. Resulting in the beginnings of the war of Mutants versus Humans. The film ends quite abruptly and I fell Vaughn could of paid more attention to detail when directing the final scenes that essentially set the whole X-men story. X-men first class fits the form of previous films in what a viewer could expect, from usual youthful behaviour to battling the world. So if you are a X-men fan and want to catch up with some of your favourite characters or you just want to experience a young, action packed, sci-fi film, check out the latest of the X-men films, as Vaughn depicts key unanswered questions."

","I don't have the emotional investment in the Marvel Universe that a lot of comic book fans do, I grew up preferring the DC super-heroes. What I know about the X-Men comes from the infrequent casual read along with my exposure to other films in the franchise. As an outsider looking in, I thought this was a blast of a story showcasing the origins of Charles Xavier (James McAvoy), Erik Lensherr (Michael Fassbender), and the rest of the early X-Men characters. I particularly enjoyed the setting of the story in 1962, using the Cuban Missile Crisis as the backdrop for the confrontation between Xavier's team and that of Klaus Schmidt/Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon). That dynamic was skillfully used to explain the eventual break between Xavier and Lensherr, with Professor X attempting to work alongside humans, while Magneto would come to realize that that could never be the case.<br/><br/>That's not to say the story didn't have it's problems. For example, when Klaus Schmidt killed young Erik's mother, why didn't Erik simply finish the job of annihilating the German right then and there in the maelstrom he created? I fully expected that to happen, even while knowing that it couldn't for the sake of the story line. That could have been handled better than it was.<br/><br/>And my biggest disappointment - no Stan Lee! I don't know what happened there, but why break the precedent established with all the other Marvel franchise films? If someone thought that was a good idea, it should be apparent by now that it wasn't. Fortunately, the Hugh Jackman cameo as Wolverine partially assuaged my feelings about the Lee exclusion. Overall, I thought this was an intriguing story with a lot of cool elements and special effects. If all super-hero films could capture this level of character development and excitement, it would make the wait for the next one that more satisfying."
"outlawblack89","6","1","2","8 October 2011"," Do not expect this to be like the first x-men movies!
","First class is a lot different than what I expected. The film has less action and more slow parts instead. Now when I refer to slow parts I would like to tell you it is story, but it is actually lots of your time wasted by them trying to tell a story about shallow characters. You sit through a 132 minute movie which should have been an hour and twenty minutes because the rest is a waste of time and boring. Yes, I know that movies like x-men are not supposed to have a best picture of the year type of story, but if you are going to have a shallow story do not waste my time prolonging it just give me action instead that is better than nothing. The movie in better than ""The Last Stand"" and is worth watching a second time I would say but no more than that. It does have decent characters (Magneto and Xavier and Kevin Bacon) but the other ones are pretty bland and than other characters are introduced in the beginning like the woman from the CIA, but than her character is completely forgotten in the rest of the film after her introduction(look at the deleted scenes on the blu ray which include her and the movie will make a little more sense)"
"MaeAbdulbaki","9","1","2","7 October 2011"," What X3 Should Have Been
","I didn't know what to expect from X-men: First Class, which was good because I didn't expect too much after the disappointment that was X3: The Last Stand.<br/><br/>This movie was well plotted, well paced, and had great characterizations. I especially loved that it started the same way the original X-men movie started, with Magneto as a child in a concentration camp and took off from there. And it was a great ride from the beginning.<br/><br/>The acting, the cinematography and the action were all superb! The cameos by Hugh Jackman and Rebecca Romijn were excellently placed and how they interlaced the plot between X-men history and real history was wonderful. The X-men world is vast and rich with many different characters and I think they chose the right ones for this movie. The friendships were well drawn out and surprising given which sides some of the mutants end up on, but still realistic enough.<br/><br/>With a lot of different comic book movie adaptations out there, X-men: First Class really does a good job overall of maintaining a balance of character relationships and plot and action. Also, it incorporates the comic book world, such as the Hellfire Club, very well that even those who don't know X-men comic book history would understand.<br/><br/>Overall, this was a very well done prequel to the X-men franchise and truly what X3 should have been. I give it a 9 out of 10 stars. Watch it! I promise you won't be disappointed."
"knowyourmovie","6","1","2","5 October 2011"," Better than the average, but far from spectacular
","The Verdict <br/><br/>Slightly better than your average Sci-Fi action flick, ""X-Men: First Class"" caters to teenage audience, although it definitely has something to offer adults as well. Overall, the movie is not in the same league as ""Inception"", ""Star Trek"", or ""Batman Begins"".<br/><br/>The Positives <br/><br/>""X-Men: First Class"" offers three main story lines. The first and by far the best out of the three is about Charles Xavier (Professor X) and Erik Lensherr (Magneto): their strikingly different childhood years and youth, their acquaintance, their friendship, their different styles of mentorship and leadership, their inner struggles and disagreements, and their fateful choices that led to the final confrontation. <br/><br/>This is a deep, touching, emotional, cleverly written, and stylishly directed story, magnificently played by James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender. It also introduces a powerful original music score, splendid decoration sets, elegant costumes, and a masterful photography and art direction.<br/><br/>If the rest of the movie were on the same high level, ""X-Men: First Class"" would have been truly first class. Unfortunately, that is not the case.<br/><br/>The Negatives <br/><br/>The second story line starts with Charles and Erik tracking down and recruiting the teenage mutants. Then it focuses on the fresh recruits: their unique gifts, their relationships, their vulnerabilities, and their coming of age.<br/><br/>So many things happen to them for the first time: first love and first loss, first great temptation and first encounter with the great evil, and of course, first life changing decisions that would ultimately put them into one of the two camps – the X-Men or the Brotherhood of Mutants.<br/><br/>The story could have been very good if the screenwriters had enough talent and courage to make it into something more than just a collection of genre clichés. <br/><br/>Instead of a poignant, moving tale, they created a stereotypical, superficial, mediocre popcorn teenage entertainment with average acting and some impressive visual effects.<br/><br/>The third story line tells us how Charles and Erik, their young apprentices, their allies from the CIA, and their main antagonist and the villain of the piece - Sebastian Shaw with his colorful gang of ""bad"" mutants become secretly involved in the Cuban Missile Crisis and shamelessly manipulate the governments of the United States and the Soviet Union.<br/><br/>That story was supposed to glue the other stories into a single, comprehensive, multifaceted narrative. Instead, it has unfortunately become one of the most primitive, ridiculous, poorly written scripts ever created by Hollywood.<br/><br/>Based on a comic book or not, a story still need to satisfy some basic standard of decency to be watchable without disgust. Based on a comic book or not, a screenplay for adults cannot be intellectually inferior to ""Dora the Explorer"", not even mentioning """"Go, Diego, Go!"""" It is especially relevant when a movie script refers to historical events.<br/><br/>Oh well, I think I should stop grumbling now and admit that the amazing visual effects and the battle scenes made the intricate twists of the 'Cuban Missile"" saga quite bearable for me.<br/><br/>knowyourmovie.blogspot.com"
"virindra","8","1","2","1 October 2011"," Great action movie.
","I liked the x-men movies and I still do. What I didn't liked was that James McAvoi was in this new movie. I didn't like him a an actor, but he changed my mind with participating in this movie. McAvoi Has learned to act in a mature way, he did it very good. Many actors can learn from him, and I never thought I would say that.<br/><br/>Overall acting was good, great action. I liked Kevin Bacon, I always have liked him as an actor. What was I surprised to see him. And also Michael Ironside who gained a lot of weight over the years. I'll never forget his role in Total Recall. It was a pity he got a small part in this movie, but still was great to see him acting.<br/><br/>Special effects were great. It is very tricky to make a prequel, especially when it has a trilogy behind of it. After seeing a new movie, it is always easy to say that this is the best x-men movie ever. That this movie is better that the previous three. But still, without the previous movies, this movie would never been made.<br/><br/>Background music was awesome, it sounded a bit like the music from Inception. It suited great with the movie.<br/><br/>(Oh yes, I forgot mentioning Hugh Jackman)."
"gradyharp","Null","1","2","17 September 2011"," Starting from the Top
","Having not followed the various forms of the Marvel Comics X MEN series except for a glance at Wolverine can be beneficial in watching this Prequel. The fantasy is explained rather coherently - mutants have developed and must be undercover for their own safety until leaders emerge, young lads from the year 1944 struggling with their peculiar identity until something pushes them to the point of taking advantage of their supernatural powers and they become committed to gathering all the other mutants together as a positive force by the time they reach adulthood. Or as the PR piece states it 'Before Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr took the names Professor X and Magneto, they were two young men discovering their powers for the first time. Before they were archenemies, they were closest of friends, working together, with other Mutants (some familiar, some new), to stop the greatest threat the world has ever known. In the process, a rift between them opened, which began the eternal war between Magneto's Brotherhood and Professor X's X-MEN.' <br/><br/>James McAvoy is Charles Xavier and Michael Fassbender is Erik Lensherr and the mutants the gather around them include Jennifer Lawrence, Lucas Till, Nicholas Hoult, Caleb Landry Jones, Edi Gathegi, Álex González, and even a quick peek at Hugh Jackman. The year switches to 1962 when Russia and the USA were coming close to nuclear war so of course the mutants fight for the end of the attempt while another set of bad mutants under the leadership of Kevin Bacon and January Jones and Jason Flemyng et al face off battling powers of telecommunication and various forms of super human acts an by the end of the film the 'together boys' - Charles and Erik have become Professor X and Magneto. Doting the over two hour long landscape are appearances by Rose Byrne playing the love interest and Oliver Platt simply called the Man in Black. it is a game of subterfuge as well as a gradually coming to terms with being a mutant that keeps the ball rolling to a rather spectacularly staged battle scene as the Russian missiles are making their way toward Cuba and the United States. <br/><br/>Matthew Vaughn directs the screenplay written by no fewer than 6 writers ad there are some impressive special effects demonstrated as the characteristics of each of the mutants. Entertaining, yes, and it stands alone well enough so that those of us who have not seen the other installments in the series can enjoy it as a 'beginning'. <br/><br/>Grady Harp"
"mergatroid-1","6","1","2","14 September 2011"," It was OK.
","I'm sorry if I'm sexist or something, but Emma Frost in this movie is nowhere near as sexy as she is in the comics and cartoons. Also, Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique was a really poor choice. She just doesn't do it for me. She has this little chubby baby face, the makeup on here wasn't anywhere near as well done as the first 3 movies, her acting wasn't the greatest and, again I'm sorry, but she didn't come close to Rebecca Romijn in the first three movies. Not for makeup, not for acting, not for the action sequences and not for her sexiness. I feel she was a very poor choice for this roll.<br/><br/>But hey, other than that it was a good movie. Great story, good actors, script and effects were well done. No other complaints about it.<br/><br/>I loved Logan's small roll in this flick. Perfect."
"lasttimeisaw","7","1","2","7 September 2011"," X-Men: First Class
","As most summer blockbusters have lost its credibility and novelty in recent years, this 120 minutes prequel gratifies me with its intricacy of different characters and the visual thumps (Magneto Vs. submarine scene is expressly phenomenal notwithstanding that it had been seen in the trailer). <br/><br/>The overwhelming bromance between Professor X and Magneto has meshed well with the gay trend and indeed the film can be introduced as a mutants version of BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN without too much toil (taking account of the overtone of the similar social situation between gay and mutant), plus nearly all female characters are curbed as wallflowers (Rose Byrne, Jennifer Lawrence) or stereotyped femmes fatales (January Jones, Zoe Kravitz). It's a man's world, even for mutants. <br/><br/>A major merit is that the film magnificently applies the Cuban missile crisis into and plot and subsequently maneuvers a credible Cold War milieu, which according to the director Matthew Vaughn, he got the inspiration from earlier James Bond films. <br/><br/>About the cast, James McAvoy plays a brainy-over-brawny hoot with ease while Michael Fassbender exudes a menacing characteristic which could widen his remit into an unprecedented area (2011 dooms to be his year, JANE EYRE, A DANGEROUS METHOD and SHAME, I bet at an Oscar nomination is unquestionably within his reach). The mutual attraction between them is mesmerizingly fruitful. But the villain Kevin Bacon is pigeonholed as a shallow badass which falls into the so-called Hollywood miscreant's formula, although his language versatility is the only saving grace. <br/><br/>Still the film cannot or dare not to be a true alien from its kins or to be distinguished from other Marvel pics, hackneyed tactics are ubiquitous (compared with Vaughn's groundbreaking previous work KICK-ASS 2010), and some parts are tedious enough to bring about a tad repellence (notably the invincible Kevin Bacon Vs. human soldiers, and the assault on the mutant base, the slaughtering is purely annoying and corny). <br/><br/>Now it is not clearly whether the film will reignite a further sequel since its the box office transcript is well underperformed. It's a pity that it is much more entertaining than THOR and the newest installment of the Caribbean pirates."
"TheHrunting","7","1","2","30 June 2011"," The X-Men in groovy training pants
","Marvel Comics and its embodiments have been rearranging and manipulating the past and present to include how super-heroes would have done it differently since the golden days of Captain America punching the lights out of Hitler. Fast forward to the early '60s and we get revisionism of the Cold War by splicing fantasy and realism to include a look at where ""mutants""--super-humans with odd mutations in their DNA giving them special abilities--fit in to society. Is the world ready to accept these flukes of nature even if it's to save the Kennedy/communist era world from nuclear war on the brink? Well, at the center of the story involves two men who look at the dilemma quite differently: an idealist junior professor from a handed down wealthy background and another man who survived from the ground up in the bleak Nazi concentration camps.<br/><br/>The beginning of X-Men: before distinct suits and names, before mutants collectively showed their ugly or beautiful side--however you want to look at it--for fear of ridicule, misunderstandings and unequal treatment. Think back to when glasses, fat kids and braces got the giggles and swirlies in the john, except the characters here instead transform certain flawed characteristics into epic super powers that would cause the normal person to stand still in their tracks and not quite possibly believe their eyes. Professor X: a telepath with persuasion; Riptide: wind control; Banshee: voice projection; Azazel: instant teleportation. These are just some of the select super heroes and villains before they knew everything about what it is to truly being one.<br/><br/>Where there are specially gifted spread out, they all have something in common and the story brings them closer together to either destroy or save humanity. Some mutants still find it in them to do good, others say the heck with the regulars who won't except them for who they are, and then, of course, there are the true villains who exploit their powers for gain. As a boy Erik (Michael Fassbender) was introduced to Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) due to being sighted as talented in the dreary concentration camps of Poland in 1944. Erik's powers of controlling metal objects only came out with extreme rage, so Shaw being the nice Nazi he is callously disposes of someone to see this come out. This creates a tormented vendetta against the man who unlocked his hidden abilities but also took something that can't be given back. By now Shaw is a little harder to get ahold of with a strong group of mutants behind him. He uses them to press a political agenda to pit Russia and the United States against each other, while he reaps the reward of the fallout.<br/><br/>What made ""X-Men: First Class"" work was there was a layered story that was dramatic while not missing out on a constantly moving adventurous side. Since this squeezes numerous characters, frequent location and language changes, not to mention two battling nations in one reasonably lengthened movie, some things do fall a little too in place to benefiting the story all coming together in one big related catastrophe at the same time. Some complex inventions and training sessions came a little too conveniently, but when are they ever realistically shown? While the mutants are at the forefront, the regular humans miss out on depth and range. Their personalities go from completely wooden to just tentatively going along for the ride to nail it home that they're utterly closed-minded to push a definitive persecution tone without question.<br/><br/>This is an entertaining experience that's both for comic book fans and regular cinema goers as it takes it all a little more seriously than other massive budget popcorn pictures by measuring out fantasy and injecting realism--including violence and people that ""actually"" die in a comic book story--to make one's imagination crack wide open and put in the direct moment. That is till someone has to go back to the day-to-day grind where they might daydream of stopping that bully, taking out that robber and if there was a power to give themselves a raise at work, I'm sure they'd do that to.

"rogerdarlington","Null","1","2","23 June 2011"," Part sequel. part reboot, full-on entertainment
","Having seen the previous four X-Men movies and in varying degrees enjoyed them all, I wasn't going to miss this fifth outing and by and large I was not disappointed. Like the last three episodes of ""Star Wars"" and the J J Abrams version of ""Star Trek"", this is prequel (as well as something of a reboot) which explains how familiar characters became the ones we know so well. Above all, we meet young versions of Charles Xaxier/Professor X (James McAvoy) and Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto (Michael Fassbender) and learn how the former finished up in a wheelchair, how the latter acquired his helmet, and how the two became mortal enemies.<br/><br/>British director and co-writer Matthew Vaughn - who first burst on the scene with ""Layer Cake"" - sets most of the narrative in the early 1960s at the height of the Cold War (although I don't remember skirts being that short then), so we are presented with an alternative vision of the causation and conclusion of the Cuban missile crisis. Lots of mutant powers and special effects are on display which keeps the action moving and the entertainment levels high. Call me weird, but I'm a sucker for a blue-skinned, shape-shifting woman and Jennifer Lawrence is especially appealing as Raven/Mystique."

","I usually do not write reviews but on this one I just HAD to! I am a great fan of the X-Men, starting to collect the comics when I was a kid. My favorite was always Wolverine and - although the first 3 X-Men movies were okay - he was never as good as in the comics. Hugh Jackmann was just not the right guy for me... Having said that, I was not sure what this movie would be like (no Wolverine - except a short cameo). I must admit, I was more than pleasantly surprised and am tempted to state this is the best X-Men movie of all of them. I did like the first movie but they just got more and more shallow and more about Wolverine than the X-Men. However, the cast was supreme (apart from Hugh Jackman). LOVED THIS MOVIE and will Certainly recommend it to fans of the ""real story"" - although this was never part of it. Job well done"
"theblacksuit3","9","1","2","10 June 2011"," Definitely the best X-Men movie.
","First let me point out that I didn't have big expectations for this movie. So far the best comic book movies have been distributed by Marvel Studios, while this is still 20th century fox. When I learned Matthew Vaughn and Brian Singer were heading the project, i knew it would regain what X-Men 3 threw out.<br/><br/>The acting was what made the movie shine. The character development was what really made the film. It definitely made up for the mediocre special effects, which were only so I'm sure due to budget limitations. James McAvoy and Michael Fassabender (Prof. X and Magneto) gave fantastic performances as their characters. You could really feel for all the characters, they all had their importance. Even the teenagers gave great character portrayals.<br/><br/>The characters are all so much more likable in this installment. The professor, Magneto, and especially Mystique seemed so much more interesting. Something I found strange though was that they made many references to the past 3 movies, but there were things that broke the continuity. However, I feel that it is important that they broke the continuity, because it was also done so perfectly. There was also an old character reference that was done in the best possible way it could have been. What this movie should have been is the start of a reboot instead of a prequel, since it was so much better. But overall it's one of the best movies i've seen. Loved it."

","Those who state X-Men: First Class is the best of the five X-men movies apparently haven't seen any of the first four.<br/><br/>Admittedly, it's better than X-Men Origins: Wolverine, and everyone has a right to their own opinion, but come on. This movie suffers from being too long, too much story – for a superhero film, too little relevance and not enough of the exciting X-Men we've become accustomed to.<br/><br/>Yeah, I'm aware it's an origin storyyet ANOTHER X-Men origin story (boy, do they like to tell origin stories verses just continuing onward, which I would prefer)but this came off way too much like another unnecessary prequel: Hannibal Rising.<br/><br/>I don't want to sound too harsh, because First Class is superior to similarly scripted Hannibal's ""Fun with the Nazis"" Early Years. I'm just getting kinda sick of the back stories. In the previous four X-Men films we had bits and pieces of the history of the characters, but none as the exploited and blatant as Wolverine's. While I loved the character of Wolverine, it was refreshing that First Class chose NOT to explore, once again, how he got that adamantium or who created him or why he lost his memory or<br/><br/>PLEASE tell me there isn't gonna be a Second Class film. Can you please do present tense? Do you have so little faith in the X-Men that they always have to go backwards and never forward? As much of a Superman fan I am, I would be thoroughly upset if the next four Supe movies deal with life on Krypton and/or yet another Smallville retelling. Move on!<br/><br/>Further, in what is beginning to look like the George Lucas Space Saga, we keep going backwards after it began forwards with the original trilogy. 2009's X-Men Origins: Wolverine is set before the first three and this one, before that. Where are we headed? The ""evolved"" fish that leaves the sea and supposedly and eventually becomes man? (Ironically, there is, in fact, a mutant named ""Darwin"" in First Class.)<br/><br/>That all said, the movie isn't exactly terrible. It absolutely could've been cut by a half hour –or any editing: the movie also suffered from poor editing. But the performances were decent, the ""surprise"" visits and homage was cute at points and the CGI/special effects were good.<br/><br/>The basic plot revolves around the rise of (the soon-to-be Professor) Charles Xavier (James McAvoy – who, while good, is NOWHERE near the talent or charisma of Patrick Stewart), the revenge-filled Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto (Michael Fassbender, who, AGAIN, isn't close to the performance of Ian McKellen and channeled a bit too much of Hugh Jackman's Wolverine) and the Cuban Missile Backdrop. Meanwhile, good/bad/indifferent/boring – especially the bad – mutants band together to come up with neat nicknames and explore their powers. Somewhat.<br/><br/>While I did have fun when Charlie and his pal Erik find other similar mutants and further, when they're being ""trained"" while the two leads bicker, the rest of the movie was like a ""based on the series"" direct-to-DVD that is for fans-only and could easily only be watched once. I might watch again, but it would have to be a TV-edited version.<br/><br/>As for the whole series, I vote for true believers to stick with the originals. X2: X-Men United is still the best, followed closely by the original X-Men. Even though, at first, I didn't care for the third installment, X-Men: The Last Stand, upon re-watching, I actually had a lot of fun during that. (If I had known what was coming, I would've appreciated it even more.)<br/><br/>Skip X-Men Origins: Wolverine, for you see his ""origins"" in the previously mentioned films multiple times, anyways. And finally, for X-Men: First Class: it's worth a viewing, but it can certainly wait for it to hit home videoand for die-hard fans only."

","This about a FAQ Question that was asked. The question was, why the original members of the X-men weren't used in this movie. They said because the characters would be to young if they fallowed the X-men movie. OK I understand but it doesn't makes sense, why they put Havok (Alex Summer) in the movie and he's the younger brother of Cyclops (Scott Summers). Some characters they used instead never were part of the X-men until they were adults and the other X-men were on the team. They must think people who read and have fallowed the X-men for years, wouldn't notice. Come on, If your going to do something like that do it right. nice excuse!"
"trcky1","5","2","7","11 June 2011"," Not quite good enough to be worth watching
","McAvoy and Fassbender display some commanding performances in this film. The set design is visually appealing with a clean retro look. Unfortunately, some of the classic X-Men luster is lost in the storytelling. Some scenes even seem intentionally campy in order to match the retro wardrobe and sets. Parts of the middle just seemed like a teen action flick, with a whole ""look what I can do"" training montage. Even though none of them have been rated R, the X-Men series has been a mature-themed series (at least the movies are) and that tone should hold true in all of the films. Additionally, the end just didn't provide a strong sense of closure. I'm a big fan of Matthew Vaughn, but this film has been his weakest directorial effort to date."

","Clap-clap-clap to the FX but I still think Wolverine was better. Yes, this story had to be told...this prequel. But there's plot holes, none convincing moments and sheer odd moments throughout that made this story line march at a staccato beat for me. WARNING*SPOILERS*AHEAD.<br/><br/>The five major plot holes and head scratching moments for me were: 1. Who and where are Xavier's Stepdad and Mom. And I'm pretty sure he 'mind-controlled' them into letting Mystique stay all those years. 2. I recall Xavier standing/walking at end of Wolverine Origins when he met Scott Summers and the other escaping mutants Stryker held on Three Mile Island. 3. What was the purpose of Kevin Bacon absorbing MOST of the wrecked submarines nuclear energy if he doesn't use it NOR at least explode when the coin penetrates his skull. Oh, and that little flick on the chin he gave Magneto should have done more than knock him across the room. 4. What was soooo convincing about Kevin Bacon's speech that instantly persuaded 'Angel' (Lisa Bonet's daughter) to switch sides to him after Bacon invaded their CIA stronghold. 5. Why didn't Magneto KILL Kevin Bacon after Bacon shot his mother? Instead, he crushes a file cabinet, soldier's skulls and throws the torture room appliances in disarray.<br/><br/>If they get any credit, it'll be for the FX. Kudos to that alone."

The characters are without any aura, although Shaw, Xavier, Magneto and Mystique are reasonably convincing.<br/><br/>There are many cases which are not understandable, like: Magneto who at the end of the movie doesn't stop the bullets, but let's them bounce of to the right and left (Charles get's invalid because of the hits of one of those bullets) while Magneto just had stopped tens of missiles in the air and had let them flip and sent back to the ships where they came from. Too bad, but we don't fall for that. Also Mystique, who easily turns to the side of Magneto while she always was with Charles. It is unbelievable and very hypocrite of her. Very funny are the butterfly girl and the air boy. It looks so stupid. Also unbelievable and mean is Charles Xavier, who at the end of the movie wipes the memory of the CIA-agent. Imagine: you helped faithfully someone to save the world and what do you get as gratitude? Someone wiping your memory. I can imagine that she would try to recollect her memory like in the movie 'memento' to find the suspect and take hold of him. Yes, mankind is right in taking on the mutants. Xavier is not honest and Magneto knows what is right. Bad guy becomes good guy.<br/><br/>Besides that. To let the story be told in the time of the Cuba- missile crises is a bit too easy. Much more interesting is to let the story evolve in something much more frightening. Like in our schools or whatever. The Cuba- missile crises is used much often in other movies and wasn't really convincing in x-men. And why the Nazis's? As the ultimate evil? Yes, perhaps, but it is also used a lot often in movies. Wouldn't just a random murder on his mother be more convincing? Or just another, unique history of Magneto and Charles? It is all too common. And about the title, First Class. Yes, the first class of Charles. But was the movie really about his first class? No, the movie was about good versus evil. The training of his first class etc. was just a fraction of the movie. The first class of Charles has a subordinate role.<br/><br/>A plus is that in the movie Russian, English and German is spoken in the right context. You don't see it that often. And Kevin Bacon did that well.<br/><br/>Everything together is my conclusion that it is a entertaining movie, but superficial and with too many weak or not strong enough happenings. That is why I rate this movie a 6.<br/><br/>Zeno Snoei"

","Look, I liked it. It was a quality film and the acting was good enough. But to rate this movie at 8+ is just a bit ludicrous. After all this is a movie about a comic book; not a character study or a cinematically beautiful piece worthy of Oscar acknowledgment. By placing an 8rating on this movie places it in the category of Godfather, Pulp Fiction, Shawshank, Shining, Requiem, etc. And it is just not worthy of that company based purely on its merits as a film. It is extremely popular and will probably sell many tickets, but that does not mean it should be so highly rated. I only felt like writing this review because looking at the top250 I see too many GOOD movies with mass appeal rated over more quality works that saw less tickets sales. Dark Knight at 10!? Haha, no sir. This movie follows that theme - quality fun summer flick but by no means a movie that should broach the 8 star rating. When reviewing films one doesn't need to be a prude but one definitely needs to use context..."

","I have just come back from watching X men First class a couple of hours ago and I have to say it has left me quite angry simply because this movie made to many references to the first x men movie when it clearly shouldn't of. Firstly Raven aka Mystique and professor X know each other in this movie which I was fine about it was a good portrayal of a relationship but when she goes with Eric at the end of the movie we are supposed to think that it leads into the first x men film which if does not because they do not know each other in the movie and that does not make sense. Another thing that I noticed and did not like with a passion was the fact that professor x did not create cerebro which we are lead to believe in x men Hank Mccoy is the creator which again is fine but does not make sense. Big mistake which got me so angry was the wolverine cameo which was plain stupid did not serve a purpose in the movie i think it was there purely for fan demand. I have to say that both main actors were great playing the characters very believable. The most to blame for the failure in Marvel themselves because they are not giving the director any creativity to make a good film it seems to me that marvel has all the say and that is final i really do hope that Marvel are prepared to change there ways in the future and not just do it for the money which clearly this movie shows."

","Superhero movies are a lot like buses. You spend so much time waiting for one, then as soon as it shows up and you hop on, you turn around to see another twenty buses coming from right down the street. Just this year we've already seen The Green Hornet and Thor, with Green Lantern and Captain America yet to be released. X-Men: First Class sits in the middle, yet another product of the studio that has currently saturated the mainstream movie market like no other in contemporary history. First Class does little to stand out from the rest of Marvel's films, but that being said, I found the near two-and-a-half hours absolutely flew by.<br/><br/>This film is an origin story: the tale of how such prominent fictional characters of popular culture became who we now know them to be. Set in 1962, the film follows the roles Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and Erik Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender) play in the formation of the X-Men, both good and evil. And because the men more commonly known as Professor X and Magneto are not yet archenemies, Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) plays the villain, a greedy and ambitious mutant responsible for the death of Erik's mother eighteen years ago.<br/><br/>The film's subject matter can at times become quite dark, which makes it all the more disappointing that an adequate script was not thought up to match the personas of key characters. In what is becoming a worrying trend for lovers of the spoken word such as myself, more and more action films are ditching the idea of putting together even cohesive dialogue in favour of easy-to-digest clichés and excessive visual grandeur. <br/><br/>Now I don't demand Shakespeare from these kinds of films, but it makes it exceedingly difficult to take the plight and the motives of the characters seriously when they don't seem to take it seriously themselves. An early flashback set in a concentration camp should set a gritty tone for the rest of the film. Instead, it is made almost comical through painfully awful dialogue and wooden delivery. Corny one-liners sneak their way in at a rate of about two per scene, all culminating to promote a character's self-respect in the least subtle way possible. You're proud to be a mutant. We get it.<br/><br/>The film doesn't really start to pop until the final half hour, a highly engaging set piece on the ocean in which Charles' mutants attempt to thwart Shaw's plan, only to discover some bad news they hadn't bargained for. For all its screenplay issues, First Class does a solid job of characterising both Charles and Erik, two powerful yet polarising figures who seek peace and redemption respectively. The way in which they decide, in a surprisingly platonic manner, to stand on opposite sides of the law because of their differing opinion on who is their true enemy, is a joy to watch. I can't help but think that, in a less profit-driven film, these two characters would be fleshed out further, but I can't fault First Class for going beyond its duties in terms of characterisation, considering it's a straight-out actioner.<br/><br/>A minor gripe rests with the film's laziness in maintaining the setting. We are told that it is set in '62, but without the black-and-white televisions featuring JFK, and the odd Beatles mop-top worn by an extra, you could be forgiven for thinking the film is set in the present day. Also, it seems most blockbusters set in this time go with one of two options when establishing a background. The film's events are linked either to the threat of Communism and a nuclear war, or the counterculture (think Summer of Love, Woodstock, all that). First Class went with the first option, and regardless of the backdrop set in the comic books (which I am not familiar with), I could have gone without it.<br/><br/>Finally, an honourable mention goes to the film's ability to tie up all loose ends, and explain, to a simpleton like me, some of the intricacies of how the X-Men came to be. These include the genetic mutation of Beast, the purpose of Magneto's helmet and how Charles ends up in a wheelchair. But put simply, in a choice between 'give it a look' and 'don't waste your time', it's a yes from me.<br/><br/>*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review.*"

","X-Men: First Class is the best film about the mutants of all five adaptations to the big screen, with the film X-Men Origins: Wolverine, focused more on the most famous mutant Marvel. This film is actually a prequel, with its events occurring well before the films adapted in year 2000. Here we are in full '60s, and Professor Charles Xavier in the newly formed college holds a post-graduate work at the United Nations and this time he get to know Erik Lehnsherr, son of Jews killed during World War II. Erik was spared by Sebastian Shaw who killed his mother in front of him after he fails to raise a coin as he had done with little gates before when he had been separated from their parents. The goal of Shaw was to provoke the fury of the boy who soon after showed all his power a little short. When the two meet years later, they seek to combat Shaw, which is a mutant and says that the mutants arose from genetic alterations caused by nuclear war and what made humans to kill, made them stronger mutants. So he sought to turn Russians against Americans against each other to cause the 3rd World War that the mutants could easily succumb to the mutants, which would be the dominant species on Earth. So friends, Charles and Erik start to gather some mutants to use their powers for peaceful purposes and decide to open the School for Gifted Young.<br/><br/>Directed by Matthew Vaughn competent (""Stardust (2007)"" and ""Kick Ass (2010)""), the great asset of this latest adventure of the mutants is acclimate the plot in a way and in a credible and realistic scenario to address once again the acceptance of mutants of human and place a political scene of history as background, in this case the missile crisis in Cuba. This more realistic narrative and more threatening to humans on the brink of a war that makes the film so interesting.<br/><br/>Vaughn constructs Charles as safe, firm and have full control of his powers already implying right away that would be the natural leader of the X-Men, as seen in previously released movies, Erik shown uncertain of his real ability with Charles help find the right spot so you can have full control of their ability, as Erik needs a better balance he should get some good feeling not to be with his kind with anger already present inside against humanity because he feels If guilty for having lost his mother because of his powers. This fact is probably the main factor that Erik does not believe that mutants can live in harmony with humans, because of this resentment. The comedy is still present, certain fact in other films, but on a smaller scale. The scene shows that's when the young mutants come together to demonstrate their powers, but sarcasm and irreverence Wolverine are not present but its rapid participation is more than special. Also part of these scenes of mood most part of specific training with interesting scenes. The strange thing is that even with one or two mutants attempts before unprepared and to be polished, already dominated masterfully control of his powers, but to give rhythm to the film is even understandable.<br/><br/>James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender are by far the best long attractions and dominate their roles, especially the latter who knew every look pass threat, anger and impressiveness of his character in an excellent interpretation. Besides the two, appear several other interesting mutants, but also get a good highlight is the Mystique / Raven talented and beautiful Jennifer Lawrence who lives the film with the dilemma of whether to accept as mutant and trying not to hide, as it did during all his life. This important and more human conflict that we explains why she chose to stand by Magneto worth mentioning in this script. Conflict that only an actress with such depth as Lawrence could pass. Besides her other characters also go through this conflict tired of prejudice and hide, as the character Hank McCoy ""Beast"" played by Nicholas Hoult, previously seen in older X-Men: The Final Conflict. Kevin Bacon is also noteworthy to us to present a character typically eccentric villain and not so stereotypical. It is he who has the most powerful mutants in principle, the creator of the most dazzling and annihilating idea, a submarine ""hi-tech"" and still have the coldness and sarcasm required in any villain coming from the comics.<br/><br/>Excess mutant characters is repeated in this new adaptation, but I do not think in this case they have become loose and contribute to the progress and dramas of the characters. The effects are fantastic and are used sparingly, without exaggeration. The great merit of direction was not to the effects the main attraction, especially for not having the actors of the previous films and have several new talents in front of him. Would try to compensate for the lack of names as well known with an effects show, but it was not the case. The development of the characters happens gradually and well done and the effects are inserted only at key times with extreme competence.<br/><br/>But many more fans of the characters noticed and did not like anything more creative liberties taken by the writers and producers to tell the story. However, X-Men: First Class knew to be a fun movie, full of action, adventure, effects and certain mood and mix well all this with a serious drama and existential conflicts over prejudice and ideological with different paths to follow in a world that is not prepared to deal with mutants, in certain times and in an important situation in the context of humanity. Matthew Vaughn delivers the pure entertainment in just over two hours."

","X-Men: First Class (2011): Dir: Matthew Vaughn / Cast: James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence, Kevin Bacon, January Jones: A superb action superhero film that addresses the origins of the X-Men characters. Director Matthew Vaughn has scored applause for his work with Stardust and Kick-Ass but this is his best work yet. James McAvoy plays Charles Xavier whose younger life had it moments of fun and games but his mind reading ability led to greater expectations. Although he trains the incoming mutants, he also saves Erik's life in an attempt to kill the Nazi who killed his mother. Still, we are given insight as to why Xavier is in a wheelchair. Michael Fassbender steals the film as Erik, whom will become Magneto. His ability to attract or manipulate metal is exploited by the Nazis who shot his mother right in front of him. Years later he seeks vengeance and even Xavier's encouragement cannot prohibit the actions he will take. Jennifer Lawrence plays Raven who can render herself into the red-headed blue babe Mystique. She is uncomfortable with her appearance and seeks a cure that can allow her to appear human. Through Magneto she learns to accept herself thus leading to actions taken in the previous films. Kevin Bacon plays a suitable villain as Nazi Sebastian Shaw who executes Magneto's mother. January Jones makes a great case as Emma Frost particularly when held prisoner and able to easily carve out a circle in the glass. Years later we learn that he too is a mutant and seeks another World War until evil conquers evil. Great insightful setup with first class special effects. Score: 10 / 10"

","Yet another origin reboot. ""X-Men: First Class"" isn't without its pluses; McAvoy and Fassbender own this movie (on the other end of that spectrum is Kevin Bacon and ehhh January Jones), not to mention Hugh Jackman in possibly the greatest cameo ever.

I wish to see just a tad more romance. Interaction between Magneto and Raven. Maybe also Moira and Xavier. <br/><br/>And the biggest thing that should be changed is telepath's ability to control others's thought and also to control what they do and can even control what they see and feel in real life. That is just too much. Common sense tells us, that is unfair! And it is. <br/><br/>Other than that, mid movie there were moments that were not the best.

"alex_howells92","9","1","3","21 May 2014"," One of the best prequel films around
","After watching the original trilogy i have always loved the connection between Charles and Erik, its always been a compelling relationship which i would have loved to have seen more of and when i first saw the trailer for First Class i knew this was going to be something special. I always loved scenes when the two of them are playing chess and talking about mankind and their different opinions on 'people just following orders'. From the start of the film you know Erik is going to be driven by anger and will ultimately go his separate way to start the Brotherhood. Personally i was a massive fan of the cast, Im a big fan of James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender, their two of my favourite actors and i cant think of anyone else who could of fitted the roles as Charles and Erik any better. The on-screen chemistry between the both of them really shows how they both effect each overs choices. there is some beautiful scenes with both of them like the submarine sequence and the ending on the beach which really make you believe the characters. I always found Mystique an interesting character and i'm glad they had an actress like Jennifer Lawrence portray her for this film. In the original trilogy she was nearly silence most of the time and was very stealthy and assassin like. I felt she had a much more interesting back story than i thought she would of had and i liked how she started as a good mutant and being a close friend to Charles and how through out the film she is slowly edging towards Erik and ultimately goes off with him. I'm not sure if any of this happens in the comics but for the film its a good way to make Mystique a more central character.There were loads of great characters and actors involved in this film, i could talk about each of them individually but to sum it up, some of the better ones were Kevin Bacon as the villain Sabastian Shaw, Nicholas Hoult as the shy and troubled professor Hank McCoy and Lucas Till who plays Alex Summers, the antisocial thug that gives Hank bit of a rough time but ultimately a good guy, plus there's a sweet cameo during the recruitment scene with i really enjoyed. <br/><br/>There's always some things that fall short in films, there was only small problems i found with this film and for me it was mainly The lack of suspense, Suspense might be the wrong word to use but with a film being a prequel you know that certain characters wont die. Charles, Erik, Mystique, and Beast were all characters that you know even if they get into trouble they cant die since their all in the original trilogy. Plus you know at some point James McAvoy will end up in a wheelchair. I guess that's why they had so many new characters introduced like Darwin, Riptide, Azazel, Angel and Banshee so they could kill off some people and you know at some point Mystique will side with Erik. So with these things all looming over i kind of felt like it took away a certain climax at the end of the film. <br/><br/>Ultimately this is one of the best superhero films iv seen and one of my favourite Marvel films to date. The film balances the action, the emotion and the character development is amazing. I would highly recommend this film to anyone looking for a good superhero film."

","When I first saw the trailer for this flick I didn't really have that good of an expectation, with ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" and all. But this one blew my expectation and maybe it's because Bryan Singer had a part in the story for this cool flick. Because the story is just well written and doesn't and the pacing doesn't seem to slow down but goes straight to the point. With actions sequences that blend right into the story. James McAvoy plays Charles Xavier and Michael Fassbender plays Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto in this flick. And both those actors are freaking awesome with the roles they are given. In fact I couldn't think of any other actors to replace them. McAvoy plays the more young and like to drink, flirt and have fun while being responsible character just so darn well. Both actors are amazing in this but if I had to pick one that stood out slightly more it would have to be Michael Fassbender as Magneto. I don't know maybe I am a sucker for cool and charismatic villains. This time around Magneto it shows more of the development process of Magneto and a bit of his origin and it's just well blended into this story. He stands out way more than all the previous ""X-Men"" movies combined. Sebastian Shaw who is the main villain that is trying to start WW3 by trying to start a war between America and Russia by using his team of mutants and Shaw is played by Kevin Bacon. Let's just say Kevin Bacon is right for this role. Although Shaw isn't a very developed character, Kevin Bacon actually makes this villain somewhat memorable. So yeah, well crafted superheroes story with well developed characters or at least memorable ones with the right actors. Makes this movie a must watch for audiences that enjoy superheroes movies.<br/><br/>8.3/10"

","X-Men, not exactly the most popular of comic book superheros, have a faithful following; and this flick is about the first assembling of young mutants and the developing of individual powers as Charles Xavier forms his mutant training academy. James McAvoy is Professor X and Michael Fassbender is Magneto and both are youthful and reckless. The mutants have yet to make themselves public, but when the ruthless villain Sebastian Shaw(Kevin Bacon),in 1962, connives the Russians to move missiles into Cuba, Xavier and Magneto gather the small band of mutants as a covert CIA operation to use their powers to stop what would be known as the Cuban Missile Crises. Formidable skills make for a masterful climax as the world escapes a nuclear Armageddon. I am not actually an X-Men fan, but I am a fan of Jennifer Lawrence, who plays the mutant named Raven. Also in the cast: Rose Byrne, Oliver Platt, Bill Milner, Zoe Kravitz, Jason Fleming and January Jones."

","I saw X-Men first Class at the theater the week it came out and its out on DVD this week. I was not a member of three guys at the time of its release. However, with its DVD now available for viewing this seemed like a good time to write up a review.<br/><br/>This is an X-Men origin story by director/writer Matthew Vaughn. We are introduced to Young Charles Xavier (Prof. X) and Erik Lehnsherr (Magneto) in the early part of the film. Other than some of the cool special effects and smoking hot half naked chicks this may have been my favorite part. Vaughn's origin story of the two characters is very well done. It certainly helps the viewer understand the motivations of the characters later in the film.<br/><br/>As the plot progresses the CIA discovers the existence of mutants in 1962 working for terrorist Shaw (Kevin Bacon). As a response to this threat the CIA recruits Xavier to assemble a team of mutants to work for the CIA. The film then shows a montage of recruitments and mutants honing their powers on both sides of the law. As could be expected conflict follows as we become aware of Shaw's evil plans.<br/><br/>I found the film to be a little bit campy. Other than the origin stories the film is set in the early go go 60's. We see a lot James Bond/Austin Powers type gadgets and shaggy lifestyle depicted. This could have been problematic for the film but it seemed to skate the line of campiness without going full blown over the top with more than a modicum of success.<br/><br/>The special effects and fight scenes in the film are top notch. I especially enjoyed the fleshing out of the Mystique character. Similarly, the way they created and utilized the character Beast was spectacular. Admittedly some of the action was a bit over the top but this is a based on a comic book series and it aiming to be fun escapism. That being the case I felt the film did more than an adequate job in providing fast paced action entertainment.<br/><br/>As an aside for Marvel purists, and comic nerd friends the film does not adhere strictly to cannon and you should prepare yourself accordingly. That being said Vaughn does a good job of capturing the spirit of the X-men and hopefully introducing them to an ever wider audience. Who knows it might even generate some more comic book readers."
"TheLittleSongbird","8","1","3","3 September 2011"," A very good and fresh prequel/reboot
","I liked this movie a great deal, while not as good as the first two movies it is an improvement on Wolverine. It is not among my favourite superhero movie but I can think of worse. It is not perfect by all means, while it was good to start with with a touch of atmosphere some of the music later on became rather generic and Jennifer Lawrence I had mixed feelings on, great looks and personality but sometimes forced delivery and her character being not as well developed as the rest. The visuals however are spectacular, with imaginative photography and editing and first-class special effects, costumes, lighting and settings. The story is mostly compelling with the action/thriller based moments genuinely intense and cracking while making way for some nuances on the social and political side of things. The script is well written too with some memorable lines, the film is well paced generally and Matthew Vaughan's direction is what makes the film so fresh. The acting is fine mostly, Kevin Bacon is a good and charismatic villain but James McAvoy and especially Michael Fassbender are terrific. Overall, very good and fresh. 8/10 Bethany Cox"

","Precisely on the half of year 2011 while many watchers expected a miracle to happen and to see some stunning movie it didn't happen a miracle.Just in the cinemas there appeared new X-Men movie.If the trilogy didn't bring you real sense of superhero story then 2009 was your year.X-Men franchise went in time before mutants' larger existence on the Earth.Wolwerine was refreshing prequel and finally some really good-structure superhero film.Now after 6 months of drought in cinemas,after 6 months of dull movies and still not enough good movies First Class arrived in the cinema.At first sight you have a story about Proffesor X and Magneto.These two characters aren't maybe so interesting as Wolverine but their fight has really nice backup.Matthew Vaughn as a director of overall teenage movie Kick-Ass in my view wasn't taken seriously.He showed that he is really shrewd and gifted.He didn't let the movie to have its ups and downns.It was constantly great and you could really be finally interested in something in cinema for about 2 hours.Michael Fassbender was kind of dark horse in his appearance but he was really surprising.McAvoy showed that Wanted isn't peak of his career.Even the appearance of the lady from Mad Men,January Jones surprised me.Her fatal appearance provided enough material for good story.Kevin Bacon in role of dirty villain concluded a really great potential of cast.The youngsters from the movie were surprisingly goood and they didn't spoil the movie.And finally my favourite 5 seconds were short appearance of Wolverine.And now after great effects you can conclude that finally we got complete movie.Who knows will the rest of the year overcome this state of art."
"jrwilson7","9","1","3","24 June 2011"," Solid beginning to the franchise
","First Class is a welcome return to beginnings both cinematically and in narrative.<br/><br/>Opening with scenes taken from Bryan Singers original X-Men where Erik (who will become Magneto) discovers his mutant power, First Class confidently walks the path made before it, but goes on to blaze a new trail of its own.<br/><br/>Having left Last Stand angry and downright broken hearted, vehemently hating the name ""Brett Ratner"", vowing that should I ever cross his path I would tear out his heart and shove it down his throat and make him choke to death.sorry. Rant over. I apologise. It still hurts.<br/><br/>I still have not seen Wolverine, my best friend forbids it. Hell, I forbid it! But after seeing First Class I am happy to see it return to form. I only hope it stays the course.<br/><br/>It is no doubt that the film is what it is because it starts with a credible story and script, has a strong cast and passionate director and producer. Director Matthew Vaughn successfully helmed last years sleeper hit, the ever-violent Kick Ass while Bryan Singer who directed the first two films, stepped in to offer assistance creatively and in a producing capacity. Singers subtle inflections and influence are noticeable throughout the narrative and production.<br/><br/>The story is great at setting up a new, and earlier, chapter of the franchise; starting in 1944 at the peak of the German invasion and travelling through to the 1960's when the US was heading into the Cuban Missile crisis. Some exposition allows the story of Xavier (James McEvoy) and Erik (Michael Fassbender) to come to the fore which then continues on through the rest of the film. This really is about a story about them and their internal battles; Xavier believing that the human world will accept them and Erik knowing that they will not. And this is where the story finds its strength.<br/><br/>There is no doubt that X-men (the comic) is about human vs mutant and the deep rooted feelings of isolation, rejection and loneliness we all feel. The X-men are simply caricatures of humanity, hidden behind a power rather than a mask. First Class subtly weaves this through the core of its premise.<br/><br/>What is also appreciated is that we get insight into is the friendship that Xavier and Eric share, right up to the fateful moment that puts Xavier in the wheelchair. Given that we only catch glimpses of this love/hate relationship in the previous films, it is refreshing to see especially for those who have not read the comics, however, for a prequel or reboot (or whatever you want to call it), perhaps a second film could have been focused on Eriks decision to create the Brotherhood. What I missed was the reference to Erik helping Xavier create the ..., but this could easily be visited in another film, they have always needed each other (as we see in Last Stand the exposition for Jean Greys character, they are friends meeting her together – although Erik has ulterior plans).<br/><br/>The cast of mutants is impressive and as this is a film to set up the ""origins"", each mutant gets adequate introduction and development (unlike previous films...sorry!).<br/><br/>Hot-property-of-the-moment, January Jones (Mad Men, Unknown) makes a delicious sight as the scantily-clad, diamond-telepath Emma Frost. There's certainly more to this woman than meets the eye! And everyone's favourite shape-shifter Mystique (Raven) is introduced as a 9 years old who befriends Xavier which is a nice touch to the overall development of the story and a through line that will come full circle in the later films. It's an opportunity to provide the juxtaposition of Erik – who believes all mutants should embrace who they are and Charles (Xavier) who believes mutant powers should be concealed so that humanity will accept them. The core fight between acceptance and rejection lies squarely on Mystiques shoulders and carried confidently by relative newcomer Jennifer Lawrence (Winter's Bone).<br/><br/>Director Matthew Vaughn (Kick Ass, Layer Cake) proves again he has flair for the comic-book adaptions, perhaps even better than Singer and must have enjoyed working with more money and scope to create a huge, and sometimes epic, motion picture. The scale of the action is mountainous and works hand-in-hand to propel the narrative forward as opposed to just being in it for the sake of the genre. Matthew Vaughn best be careful, lest he becomes the king of the comic geeks.<br/><br/>In all, this is a brilliant film worthy of its positive critical acclaim."
"kels-errific","10","1","3","23 June 2011"," Classy affair!
","I loved this movie! X-men movies as of late have not been the best, but I saw this one and within the first 45 minutes knew that this movie was a step in the right direction. Its no secret to those who know me of my love for Mystique and Magneto, so to have two amazing actors breath life into my favourite duo was an amazing affirmation from the movie telling me the franchise was in more than good hands. I will go on the record and say Wolverine is the most overrated X-men in my opinion, and revelled in the fact that he was not the primary focus in this film. The movie lends itself very well to a 60's vibe, and the story is an origins story of how Xavier and co created the xmen. Watching the film unravel, you realize that Matthew Vaughn the director understands that action itself is not enough, that to create characters you really care for stands as the proper motivation for gluing you to the screen. I really cared for all of the characters, and the payoff was the best xmen movie so far! Xcellent film :P"
"Mrohnoes","9","1","3","20 June 2011"," The Best X-Men Movie yet
","I love the X-Men movies, including The Last Stand and Origins (Yes, seriously), but this one is the best yet. The story is well put together and ties in nicely with the original 3 movies, not perfectly, mind you, but does so well enough that only the most hardcore fans will notice. The best part of the story being the relationship between Charles Xavier/Professor X and Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto (no not that kind of relationship, get your mind out of the gutter, good god), and we also see how Magneto became a villain, which I love (though you'll spot a Star Wars connotation in there, but whatever). There are 2 small problems with the story. One, a few of the mutants' powers are not explicitly explained, they are shown, but not explained. Two, it would've been nice to see how they got their powers and their first reactions to learning they have powers, (Though, I think a few powers are shown in the opening scenes of the 1st movie) In addition to the great story, there's a lot of great action as well, giving this movie a close-to-perfect mix of story and action. Are you a fan of comic book movies, the X-Men movies, and/or the X-Men in general? If so, then this movie is a must see."

"johnnymacbest","9","1","3","18 June 2011"," Best X-Men film ever.
","Just came back from seeing X-Men: First Class and to say that I was impressed would be an understatement. More than impressed. I was invigorated and excited at the same time; mainly due to the fact that Matthew Vaugn has done a remarkable job on the characterizations of the heroes and villains of this wondrous comic-book flick. This film wipes all of the crude and horrid memories of X-Men: The Last Stand. A much more focused and character-driven piece of epic cinema, X-Men: First Class rightfully deserves all the credit it gets from mainstream audiences and comic-book fans alike.<br/><br/>I'm not quite sure why there would be an uproar on the costumes that our heroes wear, but it really works; especially in the context in which the story is set that spans from the early days of World War 2 to the turbulent 1960's. Although some of the scenes play out like a certain spy series, nevertheless First Class has it's own vibe, tone, and mood. Already I'm pumped to see the next installment of the X-Men's early days of fighting for a world that once accepted them as saviors of a international crisis, but a dark cloud awaits them all, hero and villain alike.<br/><br/>So is First Class better than The Last Stand? The answer is an overwhelmingly exuberant YES!!!! Miles ahead of Brett Ratner's schlock at what Bryan Singer accomplished. Matthew Vaugn has brought an integrity, dignity, and most important of all: heart. A true testament of the spirit of the X-Men comics that encompasses a wide variety of issues plaguing mankind that exists in this day and age. First Class is first rate entertainment for not only just the action, but also the brain. See it. It's worth every penny."
"lewiskendell","8","1","3","13 June 2011"," A fine return to form for a franchise that had begun to lose its way.
","""I've been at the mercy of men just following orders. Never again.""<br/><br/>Congrats to Matthew Vaughn for getting the X-Men franchise back on track after the spiraling quality of X-Men 3 and X-Men Origins: Wolverine. First Class is an exciting prequel that changes the tone drastically from the other X-men movies, takes some risks, and delivers a movie that stands with X2 as the best in the franchise. <br/><br/>The positives start with the cast, which is almost universally great. You might think that some of the lesser known characters heavily featured in this installment might be a detriment, but it really gives an opportunity to focus on the most important characters: Charles Xavier (James McAvoy), Erik Lenhsherr (Michael Fassbender), Raven Darkholme (Jennifer Lawrence), and Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon, clearly having a ball). <br/><br/>The story is tight and interesting throughout. Real life events are weaved through the X-Men universe, grounding the plot in reality in a way that really works. It's easy to follow for newcomers, while there are tons of little things that will leave those familiar with X-Men lore with quick grins on their faces. <br/><br/>The movie isn't perfect, however. The plethora of B-characters occasionally lead to clunky action scenes because of the nature of their powers, and some repeated abilities result in sequences that are perhaps a little too reminiscent of precious movies. The film is actually better when it focuses less on big action set-pieces, which is odd for a superhero flick but indicative of how well-written the script is. <br/><br/>I also had a problem with Beast, who started out as a great addition to the movie and ended up as somewhat of misfire because of a really poor costume job. It just looked bad. All the other costumes and special effects were fantastic, though.<br/><br/>First Class is a total success, in my book. Entertaining throughout, full of memorable moments, and cast exceptionally well. It doesn't feel like the previous X-Men films, but that's not a bad thing. First Class stands on its own despite its prequel status, and turns the franchise around with some timely and fresh ideas."
"Rafi91","10","1","3","12 June 2011"," great comeback..:)
","I had just come out of the movie theaters frowning after watching this movie..not that it was bad (believe me it wains't).X-men:first class is an exceptional prequel with many moments of romance, action and drama. half way through the movie i realize that this prequel is better than any other x-men installment. The previous two installments were quite a disappointment. But this one gave its all. All of the acting was believable and best of all the action and story made it even better. James McAvoy plays Charles Xavier and delivers a convincing portrayal of any young mutant. As for Jennifer Lawerance who portrays Mystique, her chemistry towards Beast (Nicholas Hoult) is heart warming and believable as well. As the movie begins it directly displays the image of a concentration camp during the first world war involved with Nazis, so you know there will be some brutal behavior,(duh, its X-men). Eric's(Michael Fassbender) revenge and sadness in the movie really touched the hearts of many of the audience as he delivered a sense of vengeance. The rest of the story , you have to see for yourself, i wont give more away. But what is a must to say is that this is a summer movie not to miss."

","I'm a huge x-men and all things comic book fan but the recent trend in the movie industry is to put out butchered comic book movies just to make the big bucks. The x-men series, the hulk and even the batman and remake of superman movies attest to that. They all sucked, why you may ask, well crappy story lines that deviate from the originals, bad acting, and shitty cgi action scenes. These movies just seem to kid oriented which is good for the people collecting the paychecks (bigger demographic = bigger payday) but sucks for true more mature fans who covet a more sophisticated and grittier cinematic presentation. Dark Knight was a god send and a true testament to how every adaptation of a once thought ""kid"" genre can make big waves on the big screen. Dark Knight set the bar high and is now what we as fans expect to see every time our comic book heroes cross over to a full length live action movie.

I do not understand why many people have yet to see this movie, or some of the critics are tearing it down for the lack of Wolverine... I believe without Wolverine the franchise has an ability to grow and progress the other characters. Solid performances by all the major players and supporting roles, and the characters were well brought out throughout the movies and just leaves the audience begging for more and wishing to see the next movie as soon as possible. Was blown away. Definitely a must see!"

","X-men First Class delivers the x factor, it is the best since X3 Best out of the xmen series action balanced with dialog, not as action packed as the rest but focuses more on storyline and character development which makes this film a stand-out film, the soundtrack was excellent for this film with great visual effects. The actors did a excellent job particularly Professer X, Magneto and Mystique It gives a great look at the back stories of these character if your a xmen fan and if not it has enough to keep you entertained. It also contains some surprises with cameos from other xmen films, a notably humorous one is the stand out of cameos . Anyway i recommend to see this film in theaters to gain the full experience, it is definitely worth the watch."
"sildarmillion","9","1","3","6 June 2011"," Best X-Men movie I have seen
","I wasn't expecting much, but it was AWESOME! It was really long, which was a good thing, because I enjoyed almost every minute of it. The characters were great - as in, I felt that all of them performed really well.<br/><br/>I had enjoyed X-Men and X2 well enough, but my only X-Men exposure having been the X-Men: Evolution animated series, I found all the characters extremely different from what I was used to. Maybe if I had read the comics or watched the original animated series, I might have enjoyed it a bit more, but it really bugged me when characters I knew and loved had completely different personalities. I did not enjoy X3 at all and I haven't and don't plan on watching Wolverine.<br/><br/>The characters in first class were mostly new, so I didn't have any preconceived idea of what they should have been like. And as far as Professor X, Magneto and Mystique went, I had no expectations for what they should have been like when they were young.<br/><br/>I thought the character development was great. I thought the tension build up was great. (I was literally clutching my purse at tense moments, especially when you know what's about to happen - like when Hank was injecting himself with the ""cure"".) There were some great cameos, and there were a lot of genuinely funny moments. And the fact that most of the mutants were teenagers who were learning to use their powers was reminiscent of X-Men Evolution episodes, so I really enjoyed that.<br/><br/>I watched reviews which thought the ending was too rushed and they should have waited another movie to build up the Charles/Eric relationship and the Magneto/Mystique relationship. I think I do agree with that, although if Eric didn't become Magneto in this movie, and if Charles didn't become Professor X and get in his wheelchair - the climax would just not have been as satisfying. But even though they have parted ways, I hope the sequels will attempt to develop the relationships even further."
"lukalele","9","1","3","5 June 2011"," Brilliant
","It's becoming more and more apparent when a decent director takes control of a movie series over one that's, well... not so decent. Aside from the action, effects, lore etc. we come to expect from a 'comic-book movie', this film has an amazing amount of feeling and emotion to it as well. Brilliantly written and directed, and with a line-up of actors that are a perfect complement (and they all do fantastically in their roles), this is definitely one to see if you're any kind of fan of the X-Men.<br/><br/>And if you are, you will already have a good idea of how the characters we know and love met, what shaped their future selves (of which we've seen a great deal, to varying success in the trilogy), and the situations which affected who they are to become and I'm very happy to say that while this film takes a few liberties here and there, you can easily accept them as they're inconsequential and the story itself is certainly decent enough to allow us to overlook the liberties taken.<br/><br/>Best to leave your expectations at the door with this one, especially if you've let any part of the trilogy affect them negatively. I enjoyed this immensely. Highly recommended."
"martinrobertson300482","7","1","3","5 June 2011"," Awesome!
","First off, I'm truly glad that this franchise hasn't chickened out too the current ""reboot"" trend. ""X-men - first class"" is all the better for acting out as a prequel too the original trilogy (all 3 films off which I liked) and in being set in the 60's, still manages too stand alone and feel like a fresh take on the entire superhero thing.<br/><br/>Perhaps the poorly received ""Wolverine"" adds too the awesomeness off this one. I went in not really knowing if the film was going too be any good or not, so was so overly happy when it rocked! I had my doubts about some off the cast, and off course, the characters being used here aren't as cool as the better ones already used in the first 3 films. But the flicks crammed with great moments, is fast paced, has riveting action, and has excellent turns from Michael Fassbender and Kevin Bacon amongst others.<br/><br/>The best thing in the film though is Fassbender. Who'd off thought anyone could top Iain McKellon as Magneto? But here Fassbender is superb, making the character his own. Seeing the character as young as he is here makes him far more bad-ass too, which is ultimately what makes him the stand out star off the movie. I wanted too cheer at almost every scene Fassbender had as this truly awesome villain.<br/><br/>Still not sure about James McAvoy as Charles Xavier though. OK he pulls it off. But I can't help but feel he just doesn't suit the part, least off all because off that mass off dark he has. Also, out off all the fairly forgettable continuity errors in the movie (Spoiler alert ahead!) his character ending up in his wheelchair at the end is perhaps the only one I find hard too over look. Considering we seen Patrick Stewart standing in flashbacks presumably set after this in earlier films.<br/><br/>Not sure about the girl who played Mystic either too be honest, although it was cool too see who is probably one off the most interesting characters from the ""x-men"" in amongst this lot too.<br/><br/>All the ravings about this being the best one since ""x-men 2"" are totally true though. More ""first class"" x-men movies please!"

"holleratyourbutler","10","1","3","5 June 2011"," Not flawless, but pretty damn close...A wonderfully refreshing comic book movie which resets the bar
","There's so much i can go into but i'll keep it concise.<br/><br/>Story/Script - absolute stroke of genius setting this tale to the backdrop of the Cuban missile crisis and civil rights movement. Intertwining the mutant tales with real history really upped the stakes. This is also perhaps the first film where there was little character development for most of the x-men and yet I still rooted for them because as character actors they were so grounded in reality (powers aside) and convincing. Havok, darwin, angel, banshee, mystique (particularly her) all fulfilled their character roles flawlessly but I would've liked to see more explanations for the characters pain (particularly havok). It gets a 10 from me regardless because it wasn't a deal breaker. Azazel and riptide definitely deserved more dialogue and exposition although what they lacked in that they more than made up for in their actions, some of the most bad ass action sequences involved them.<br/><br/>Performances - By far the highlight were James mccavoy and Michael fassbender (professor X and magneto respectively). Magneto brought much gravitas and angst to his role while professor x was instantly likable the minute he was on screen. Jennifer Lawrence gave the best female performance as mystique. Rose Byrne fell just shy of the mark, although he performance was consistent throughout. The biggest surprise and dark horse of this film however was definitely Kevin bacon, who played the smooth, suave but maniacal Sebastian shaw (leader of the hellfire club). He was almost a cookie cutter bond villain but it's all in the performance. Setting it to the backdrop of a potential third world war gave his plan more real world connotations and it was quite scary how close to real world 'new world order' conspiracies it mirrored. <br/><br/>There are subtle real world conspiracy mirrors in this film that the average person wouldn't pick up on IE) Jews having been persecuted becoming no better than the Nazi with superiority complexes much like zionists in israel and the u.s today...<br/><br/>Direction - the direction was flawless, director Matthew Vaughn is the master of juggling an ensemble cast and pacing (when you also consider he only had 9 months to shoot this film). Cinematogrpahy was off the chain and one particular sequence involving Azazel was by far the most impressive cinematic action sequence i've ever seen in a pg-13 film (and it was brutal to boot) Very little I can fault this movie on, I thoroughly enjoyed it, it had everything I could've wanted out of a comic book movie. Small niggle was 'beast' and his prosthetics which would make his eye looked crossed, it was a slight annoyance but in context it wasn't a 'deal breaker' either. It just reminded me I was watching a comic book movie again... :)"
"LazySod","5","2","10","6 June 2011"," Not gripping at all.
","Set in time years before the start of the first film this prequel shows the younger years of two of the more known mutants - Professor X and Magneto. Mankind does not yet know the mutants exist - and the mutants are doing their best to keep it that way by sticking to hiding.<br/><br/>The trouble with prequels is that the ending is already known. Normally that wouldn't make for so much of a problem (it's the how you get somewhere that counts, not the where you get) but in this film it is. From the very start of the film it becomes clear that this film is going to have to bend the rules of the continuity of the series (or even break them) to work out and that point becomes painfully clear later in the film.<br/><br/>What follows is a series of events that fits the theme in behaviour and speed (although the beginning was too slow to my liking) and since it is known where everyone is going in the end it just doesn't matter - it's a pointless recap of what might have happened in the past of the players in the other films but that can't really have happened because the rules had already been laid out differently.<br/><br/>So, all in all, the film fails pretty hard. The action sequences are more of the same, the story is mediocre at best, and although the acting is pretty decent that alone is not enough to save it.<br/><br/>5 out of 10 mutants better removed from the gene pool"

Fassbender holds his own and pulls impressive faces while trying to come to terms with his powers. All though the the seen on the beach with the missiles is almost comedic. (harpoon missiles only manufactures since 1977 not in 1962). Nitpicking aside and with a young and impressive upcoming cast there are moments which are good but felt the movie lacked substance and was aimed at its younger audience. <br/><br/>Felt the writing was limp and the editing weak,also the cinematography could have taken a page out of dark knight or even the previous x men movie's (why did Bryan Singer not direct this)it felt to clean and light. <br/><br/>Perhaps a cynical look and American Summer Fare which overall has disappointed thus far and it looks set to continue with Ryan Reynolds adding a comedic touch to a classic comic book hero in the green lantern."
"bassrourke","6","4","32","30 May 2011"," the prequel we had to have
","Fans may disagree with me but, this reboot was needed after Wolverine Origins brought down the X-Men universe to a shambling mess, however it is also a step up from the third X-Men film. Seeing the youthful Professor X and Magneto as best friends working together before becoming archenemies is a brilliant concept. The mutants, some familiar, some not so familiar are well represented among the human existence. Settings around the early 1960's is a brilliant move with the era lovingly created, especially the costumes. Frantic and loud as they may be, the action set pieces are nothing short of astonishing. The submarine moment lives up to the excitement of the trailer. January Jones just needs to appear on screen as sultry Emma Frost to captivate me, while Australian Rose Byrne rocks as Doc MacTaggert. Perfect casting of McAvoy and Fassbender as Xavier and Magneto respectively is a constant winner. I know the fans are going to probably hate Kevin Bacon, he's different to his comic character. Lame one liners aside, this is a fine accompaniment to the Marvel film plethora on the horizon. Also watch for a rather vulgar but memorable cameo from a 'hairy' X-Men favorite."

The story line was excellent, I just understood where the mutants come from and their motives to be who they are. The action thats another A+ for the movie just the necessary and more. Incredible work incredible movie what can i say, I have no words just that you have to enjoy this movie!!!!!!!!!"
"hubdave","Null","1","4","12 October 2011"," Nowhere near as good as the first two films. Doesn't deserve anything above 5 stars.
","This is the first review I've written on IMDb. I felt compelled to write one after seeing the ludicrously high score this film gets.<br/><br/>I'm a 25 year old guy who enjoys action flicks like Transformers, X-Men, Iron Man and so on. I absolutely loved the first 2 X-Men films; I thought the first was the best, the second almost as good (amazing opening scene!). The third was a disappointment, which was expected due to the director change.<br/><br/>I quite enjoyed X-Men: Origins purely because Hugh Jackman plays Wolverine so well. I thought it was better than X-Men 3, but not as good as the first two.<br/><br/>This film though, First Class, absolutely does not deserve the score it's averaging at the moment, it's really not great. If you're a fan of superhero movies you should definitely watch it, for me it was a ""fun ride"" like X-Men: Origins, but really it's a soulless CGI flick with an extremely predictable plot and some terrible dialogue.<br/><br/>That said, there are some good performances, most notably that of 'Magneto'. There is also one scene - something of a flashback to the X-Men 2 intro - which is extremely cool and worth watching.<br/><br/>Overall I think this film deserves 5 / 10, however I'm giving it 1 in an attempt to counterbalance the ridiculously high score others have attributed to it!<br/><br/>Watch when you're in the mood for some chilled fun, but bear in mind it's not up to the standard of the originals, nor of Transformers."

","Superheroes movie has developed overtime, they start to discuss the inner depth of human(though most of them are not human sapient) mind.<br/><br/>X-men series is the one that's fancy and excited to me, but not so deep in discuss a topic, it lacks good persuasive why some mutants wanna kill all the human. When it comes to X-men 3, the war became ridiculous to me.<br/><br/>However, when it came to the ""First Class"", it really astonished me. The storyline is so attractive, the combination with cuba crisis is marvelous, I was keen to watch how it going in my second viewing time. The people are more attractive than the series because this movie make people know more about their inner depth, instead of only how they shoot their fire.<br/><br/>""First Class"" pushed X-men to an epic level, it can be the best superhero film after ""The Dark Knight"" to me."
"brando647","9","1","4","28 September 2011"," Finally, Another Great X-Film!
","We haven't had a good X-Men film since Bryan Singer left the franchise, and I was ready to give up hope on the whole deal after that Wolverine catastrophe. Word of development on a prequel arrived and all I could think was, ""This isn't going to end well."" Even with director Matthew Vaughn attached, I couldn't get excited. The trailer grabbed my attention but did nothing to quell my fears. I mean, another origin story (strike one) with teenage characters (strike 2) and only one member of the original comic line-up? How could this possibly end in anything but cinematic disaster? Well, I was wrong to doubt Vaughn and this movie quickly became one of my favorite movies of 2011. The film is set in the early 60s and establishes the friendship of Charles Xavier and Erik Lehnsherr. Former Nazi and current head of the Hellfire Club Sebastian Shaw is involved with both the United States and Russia with plans of pushing the global superpowers towards nuclear war. Xavier is recruited by the C.I.A. to assemble a team of mutants to combat Shaw and his team of mutant henchmen, while Lehnsherr has plans of his own. He and Shaw have a history going back to young Lehnsherr's imprisonment in a concentration camp during World War II where Shaw killed his mother, and Lehnsherr wants revenge.<br/><br/>Sadly, Fox has an established movie canon for the X-Men series so they weren't able to use the original comic team (Cyclops, Marvel Girl, Beast, Iceman, and Angel) and instead we're left with sort of an X-Men B-team with a handful of characters that probably wouldn't have been more than a cameo in any other X-film. Hank McCoy/Beast is the only member of the original team who makes it into the film and, while Nicholas Hoult did a fine job as the socially awkward scientist on a personal mission to rid himself of his visible deformities, it's the actual appearance of Beast that doesn't sit too well with me. The Beast effects in THE LAST STAND were actually pretty cool in my opinion and probably the best we'd get without going CG. In FIRST CLASS, Beast looks like someone took an old-fashioned Wolfman costume and soaked it in blue dye. I eventually got over it, but it was a bit of a distraction. The rest of the team is filled out with Banshee, Angel (not the original Angel, but actually Tempest from a later X-Men comic series), Havok, Mystique, and Darwin. You can see they were reaching a bit when finding characters to fill out their movie, but the team comes together better than I expected. The fact that we've got a younger team does lead to some corny moments; the scene in which the team assigns themselves their ""codenames"" feels forced, but I guess it had to happen if we want to start recognizing them as Havok, Banshee, and Angel instead of Alex, Sean, anduhAngel.<br/><br/>The big three in this film are James McAvoy (Xavier), Michael Fassbender (Lehnsherr), and Kevin Bacon (Shaw). McAvoy and Fassbender didn't necessarily try to mimic the performances of Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan from the original trilogy. These characters really feel as if the actors tried to make it their own, but it worked out so well that it feels as if they'd later develop into the Stewart/McKellan incarnations. Since this film really focuses on Xavier and Lehnsherr, it's important that the two had such great chemistry as it depicts the strength of their relationship and how their views on mutant/human relations eventually drove them apart. And Kevin Bacon continues the comeback he started in the wicked indie superhero-wannabe film SUPER. Bacon is awesome as Shaw. He just makes a great villain; he knows how to play evil and he comes across as so cool that it's hard to totally hate the man. It just sucks his team didn't live up to his level. January Jones is bland as Emma Frost, and both Azazel and Riptide (I actually had to check the credits to find this character's name) are nothing more than muscle with no development. I really hope Azazel gets some more attention in future films.<br/><br/>I was surprised this film didn't do better at the box office. It was easily the best superhero movie of 2011 but it couldn't make the same cash as the other 2011 Marvel films. I loved how this film focused just as much on the characters as it did the action. There's plenty of great action in the movie, but we also get a great balance of scenes with the characters themselves: training the team, strengthening the Xavier/Lehnsherr bond, etc. Even with so much attention paid to the story, this movie never slows down and the 60s atmosphere gave the film a retro vibe that I couldn't get enough of. It's a lot of fun and I can honestly say I think it's at least as good as X2, possibly better. Matthew Vaughn has done what I'd begun thinking was impossible: creating an awesome new X-Men film."
"Samiam3","6","1","4","11 September 2011"," Imperfect, but I'll give it a passing grade
","Although not underwhelming, There is something missing from X-Men first class. I felt it took a little long to get going and there were too many characters that didn't amount to enough. As an origin story X-Men first class did an adequate job of getting the characters where they need to be without too much contrivance, As an action film, it's coherent and competent, often visually stimulating, but the story was a bit scrappy. I felt it took a little long to get going and there were too many characters that didn't amount to enough.<br/><br/>Michael Fassbender may have second billing but the movie belongs to him. The majority of the drama in the film surrounds him, and subsequently his performance was the best. James MacAvoy doesn't quite have Fassbender's commanding presence but he brings a nice slyness to the picture. Jennifer Lawrence meanwhile is just a waste of talent in a role that is surprisingly under defined, and as Raven, she looked a little clunky.<br/><br/>As I said, the film is a little slow to get going but the climax was strong enough. I was impressed with the camera work, and the overall assembly was nice, The appearance of Michael Ironside was a cute touch My only comments would be that Beast looks too much like Cookie monster, and Kevin Bacon spends a bit to much time in a Greek helmet that looks rather big on him.<br/><br/>Looking back on the experience, I'll say that X-Men first class has skill but the product is incomplete. It's a body that needs a little more flesh on it."

","I spent a bit of time reading reviews on this one before even watching it. I hate prequels because I relate it to watching a recorded sports game. It just doesn't feel the same to me.<br/><br/>However after all the reviews I decided to give this ago since I was a big X-men fan growing up.<br/><br/>I won't say much since it has all been said already, but I will clearly say, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It is far superior to the other three X-Men movies in every way.<br/><br/>I only wish now that they would continue on in this style with more X-Men movies, trumping the old movies.<br/><br/>To the few reviewers who posted bad reviews...what a joke."
"Richard_Moreu","7","1","4","29 August 2011"," Balanced review of an unbalanced film
","If one will like or dislike this film should first depend on if one generally likes or dislikes comic-book superhero flicks.<br/><br/>When the subject matter is super heroes with powers that seem like physics-defying magic, but are supposedly just mutations of the human genome, one HAS to suspend disbelief. For instance, one character can shoot what appears to be laser hoopla hoops from his belly, and yet in every other aspect his body functions like any normal human. So is the laser hoopla hoops produced by severe belly ache (in turn caused by anxiety over failed physics exams)? I think not. But as it is the nature of these kinds of movies never to explain such things, any guess is as good as mine, really.<br/><br/>Yet, even if you do suspend your belief in physics, some scenes may still appear outright silly (every one including Banshee). Other scenes seem to suffer from poor execution (SPOILERS: Magneto seems more interested in staring at a wall than turning his attention to his mom after she is shot, kid Xavier and Mystique meet and within seconds they are pals and Xavier decide he can adopt her, basically all military commanders are dumbed down and reduced to props). These issues could be partly caused by time contraints, as it would take more time to play out scenes in a more natural way.<br/><br/>However, the performances of the key actors and the main elements of their stories are what carries this movie. Sure, it may not follow the continuity of the series, but it tells an interesting story. James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender and Jennifer Lawrence are all excellent. The rest of the cast do not need to be (to me none of the others were remarkably good nor bad).<br/><br/>The heart of this movie is really the interplay and friendship between Magneto and Professor X, and the relation of Mystique and the men in her life. Professor X is played as an intelligent, empathic and humoristic smooth-talking 20-something, perhaps more care-taking than he is bad-ass. This leaves room for a slightly older, darker and avengeful Magneto, who is all cool (perhaps too much so, as he is later supposed to be the immoral bad guy). The interplay between these two characters will make the movie for you, or break it.<br/><br/>The other thing to pay attention to is Mystique's relations with the men of the cast. She is looking for someone to love her, and she has self-esteem issues because of her appearance, much like many young women, and even worse as she is blue-skinned. (SPOILERS ahead) Professor X sees Mystique more as a sister, despite the fact that she constantly hints she wants more than that. Beast seems to be more interested in her DNA than her person, and both him and the professor assumes that Mystique would be better off looking like a ""normal"" person. Despite Mystique's efforts, the only man that seems to accept her for what she really is (in appearance at least) is Magneto, who she therefore grows attached to.<br/><br/>Yet even as I felt genuinely touched by the three characters of Magneto, Prof X, Mystique and their interplay, the other plot and character elements of the movie added very little to the experience or even interfered with it. The movie seems mired with holes or inconsistencies, yet for this type of film that is the rule rather than the exception. Some of the special effects scenes were very entertaining (Azazel's and Magneto's particularly), and even if the placing of the events during 1960's cold war was not perfectly executed, it made an interesting element.<br/><br/>Taken for what it is, a comic-book hero flick, the special effects are pretty standard, but the acting of the main leads are high above expectations."
"saadgkhan","7","1","4","28 August 2011"," Almost Perfect
","X-MEN: FIRST CLASS – CATCH IT ( A- ) X-Men: First Class introducing into the friendship of Professor-X and Magneto. The movie starts with their childhood, where we see how one lives a perfect life and other tormented. We have been aware of story and believes of Professor X and Magneto. They have been clearly showed in previous X movies. The X-Men:First Class is a really good movie which some great action sequences specially in the end and where all young mutants get attacked by Sebastian Shaw and his disciples. The movie did a really decent job in presenting each mutant and its talent plus in bringing variety of youngsters all together. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbeder complemented each other to the fullest. Though, I felt we didn't get to see them spending much quality time which indicate the true friendship. Michael Fassbender has this power to adopt every role, this man never disappoints. He shines through his roles. James McAvoy was a perfect choice to play Mr.Nice & Naughty Professor-X. after the lead mutants, Jennifer Lawrance Aka. Raven Aka. Mystique got the best scope in showing her adjustment with being BLUE. Stepping into Hot shoes of Rebecca Romijn is a huge deal. We have been seeing Mystique unique, tall and sexy. Jennifer Lawrence is nothing like her but she sue is great actress. I think she was better human than Mystique in this movie. Nicholas Hoult is charming as geek but as Beast, well he was more of a wolf than a Beast. Lucas Till is stunning in swinging flames. I just love his heavy voice since Hanna Montana. Zoe Kravitz is sweet little sultry Angel. Caleb Landry Jones as Banshee is cool, he get to do some amazing stunts. Edi Gathegi as Darwin, Jason Flemyng as Azazel, Álex González as Riptide were good. Now lets talk about other cast Rose Byrne as Moira MacTaggert is top on the weird CIA Agent. Oliver Platt as The Man in Black was right out of ""The Big C"". Kevin Beccon as Sebastian Shaw is pretty good. He wasn't as strong but he was wicked. January Jones as Emma Frost is Ice-Cold and apparently if too be believed she is Ice Cold in real life too. I think it won't be wrong to say that this girl has become the 2nd most hated actress in Hollywood after Katherine heigl. Their imagine in media is not shaping good. Anyways just like in Unknown she was Ice cold in this movie too and luckily she was the Perfect choice. So, the X-Men: First Class is almost perfect movie with some great action and performances but still their was something missing just like in Thor. There is something missing in movies that has not been able to made them A 101% Perfect Roller coaster ride. P.S Cameos by Rebecca Romijn as Mystique – older, Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, Sasha Pieterse as Teenage Girl by the aquarium are appreciated And I was shocked to see Brendan Fehr as almost Nonspeaking Communications Officer's role."

"siderite","Null","1","4","21 July 2011"," Really good! It was worth suffering the other X-Men films
","Someone had the idea to cash in the X-Men concept in a series of movies and they did try to follow the comic, adding as much special effects as was computery possible. However, it all backfired when the dated (and often conflicting) general ideas in the graphic novel made the movies little more than casual entertainment. So they did the ""reinventing"" trick. Find some smart people and rewrite stuff so that it matches with the past, but removing the ridiculous part. Kind of like changing the Klingons in StarTrek, another perpetually reinvented franchise.<br/><br/>The amazing surprise is that they did a good job. The plot is complex, the characters well defined and in the end you are left wanting more, while understanding why everything happened the way it did. A cast of good (but not unnecessarily shiny) actors ranging from James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender to Kevin Bacon and Michael Ironside complemented the well written plot. I even liked the little Wolverine cameo scene, which was funny and subtle, something rarely seen in American movies.<br/><br/>Bottom line: I really want more! If they keep up the good work this could really mean a movie renaissance of the X-men idea. Not flashy arrogant super power stars, but people with feelings and complex history behind them and normal except the mutation that is both blessing and curse. In spirit, so much closer to the comic than the other dreadful attempts at putting it in movie form."
"davidgee","7","1","4","17 June 2011"," Souped-up same-old
","Sorry, folks, to be the party-pooper, but I thought this was just another comic-strip movie with brilliant CGI and better-than-usual performances. It was easy to feel that McAvoy and Fassbender would physically ""grow up"" to be Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart, BUT the transition from headstrong good-guy Erik to super-baddie Magneto seemed to come from nowhere. Kevin Bacon's villain was from the school of Blofeld and I liked the notion that Mutants played a key role in the 1962 Cuban Crisis (although it somewhat detracts from the brinkmanship skills of John F. Kennedy!). This is only a prequel in the sense that we saw the Mutants honing and controlling their ""gifts"" before pitching them against Kevin Bacon's Doctor Doom in routines that we have seen too often in Marvel comics and movies. Reminding us that Superheroes are just as insecure as the rest of us has also been done before, more successfully with Batman and Superman than with the over-angsty Spiderman. The ""conversion"" of Erik and Raven into Magneto and Mystique was little more than a postscript to link back to the Trilogy. Otherwise this was quite a lot of souped-up same-old. The blockbuster I'm really looking forward to this summer is Cowboys and Aliens. I also hope the Alien prequel will do a better job than X-Man: First Class; the Alien movies set a very high standard."
"arnieiam","8","1","4","6 June 2011"," Continuity and Magneto
","Well I still think its a good film because the script wasn't corny, the acting was terrific, and the story itself is actually solid. However being a fan of the comics and the previous films, I can't help but shake myself of the fractures in continuity.<br/><br/>OK fine, I very well know it's a very loose prequel, granted that. I don't care how for the most part it doesn't fit into the X-Men films of the 2000's, that's not it. I care because it really hindered Magneto's character development.<br/><br/>Magneto is one of the greatest villains of all time and you can even check that on IGN.com. The reason why is because of his convictions and how he was strongly imbued with them. Having survived the Holocaust, Magneto becomes convinced that his fellow mutants could suffer the same fate as the Jews, hence he becomes the terrorist that he is.<br/><br/>In this film however he meets the film's villain, Sebastian Shaw, in the death camp. Shaw wanted Magneto do display his power by moving a coin, and to provoke him he shoots his mother right in front of him and yes he triggers Magneto's powers in the process.<br/><br/>So basically, Magneto's initial intentions are revenge against a single person rather than humanity. So you can see how the scope is lowered. Only until the end we see Shaw tell him that when the Cold War ends, humans will turn to mutants and hunt them down. That's when Magneto becomes Magneto. I think that's too cheap. It seriously spoiled the modus operandi of one of the greatest comic book characters.<br/><br/>However it's still a good film. Better than Thor. I don't think it's better than the original X-Men films however, X2 was brilliant. I like how Professor X became a paraplegic in this film than in the comics. In the comics his legs were crushed by a boulder where in this film a bullet hits his spine.<br/><br/>It's still worth a $10 ticket."

","I generally find it quite hard to enjoy movies that have so many plot holes and inconsistencies, but managed to this time. The great, engaging cast (January Jones aside) and depth of characterisation had much to do with this, as did the flawless editing and cinematography.<br/><br/>It's a shame they didn't spend more time working out details like why Raven seemed to grow up most if not all of her life in England yet has an American accent for some reason (I know the real reason was Jennifer Lawrence being incapable of mastering an English accent, but what about in the movie?), how her brother-sister back story relationship with Xavier is completely inconsistent with anything in previous films/comics, how non-Americans can so easily find themselves working for the US government, and I could go on and on.<br/><br/>None of these issues completely drag the plot down since none of them are completely crucial to it, but you get the feeling that if they had spend a bit more effort addressing these problems this could have been a real masterpiece (well at least as far as big budget epic blockbusters go).

"tgrock","7","1","5","16 June 2011"," 1/2 Great Film, 1/2 Average Film
","This film could've been amazing. The characters of Magneto and Xavier bring a new energy to the series. As a fan of the animated cartoon, I never got to see either of these characters fully fleshed out with their backgrounds (there was one episode of a flashback, I believe).<br/><br/>While the first half is excellent, the last thirty minutes or so are just okay. This is mainly because the focus is mainly on Magneto, Xavier, and MacTaggert. The last thirty minutes deals with training the students of Xavier and an epic battle. The problem is that none of his students (except for Beast or Mystique) are layered-characters and that they are all b-side characters. There is no reason to care about them.<br/><br/>Regarding the final battle, the only entertaining parts involve Magneto and Xavier. The other parts involve the b-side x-men battling the b-side villains. The worst of the latter is the battle between Angel and Banshee. It's just plain cheesy and unnecessarily dull (almost cringe-worthy). In fact, the whole character of Angel, along with her super powers, is lame (along with Havok too, who is just a sub-par version of Cyclops).<br/><br/>The film could've worked without the inclusion of any of the b-side x-men. Xavier, in theory, could take out any of the villains, but Singer and Vaughn must have felt that it was necessary to have some more x-men we hadn't seen before. It's just really too bad that there aren't any good ones to really choose from that we haven't seen before."
"markdroulston","7","1","5","15 June 2011"," Mostly excellent, but left me wanting
","It's obvious to anyone who pays even the slightest attention to the industry that Hollywood has, over the past decade or so, become obsessed with comic book adaptations, and 2011 is choked with more of them than any year before. Thor kicked things off a few weeks back, and soon we will be seeing Green Lantern, Captain America: The First Avenger, Cowboys and Aliens, and The Adventures of Tintin, along with several other lesser known comic films. This week, Marvel Studios unleash X-Men: First Class, directed by Matthew Vaughn (Kick Ass), a prequel to the previous three X-Men films. Well, the first two anyway. This is in fact the second time we've had a movie this year which is the fourth in a series (not to mention the fifth in series Fast Five), and it is becoming hard to get enthused about the endless sequel/remake/reboot machine that Hollywood has become. So, what's to get excited about in the latest X-Men film? As it turns out, quite a lot.<br/><br/>Perhaps most importantly for many fans (myself included), X-Men: First Class makes almost no reference to the last film in the series, Brett Ratner's execrable X-Men: The Last Stand, while subtly maintaining links to Bryan Singer's excellent original two movies. Set in 1962, First Class tells the origins of Charles Xavier's (James McAvoy) research into mutant genetics, the formation of his school for gifted youngsters (mutants), and the forging of his friendship, and ultimate rivalry, with Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto (Michael Fassbender). Having Singer back in the fold as producer and co-writer really pays off, and only highlights how his lack of input on the film series he began effectively destroyed The Last Stand. Singer's knowledge of the characters and mythology ensures that much that was great about the first two films is back on display, and this is clearly his film. While Vaughn does a competent job in the director's chair, his sensibilities seem to be more suited to less conventional projects, such as the merciless deconstruction of comic book superhero tropes that was Kick Ass. Still, First Class is a welcome return to form for the series.<br/><br/>The period setting of First Class also adds very welcome variety to the franchise, and the costumes, dialogue and settings all playfully allude to the swinging sixties ideals reminiscent of early James Bond, or perhaps more accurately the Bond-lampooning Flint films. Two particular montage sequences closing out the first and second acts winkingly recreate not only the free-spirited mood of the time, but sixties filmmaking techniques as well. It's clever, and it works as a nice counterpoint to some of the darker elements, which are where First Class's strength really lies. While this is a Marvel film, Singer and Vaughn clearly are striving for a more real-world feel than the Avengers universe of the most recent Marvel adaptations. Interweaving the plot into such a defining real-world event as the Cuban missile crisis is ambitious, yet for the most part it works. While it's maybe a little silly, it is fun to see this kind of revisionist history creeping into the X-Men universe, and it's nice to have a Marvel film that doesn't need to play by the Avengers rules.<br/><br/>So, all things considered, X-Men: First Class is largely a successful entry into the series, but I have to add a little addendum to my review: in all honesty I was a little disappointed with the film for one reason. Now that this story has been told, it's unlikely that we will ever see the long-rumoured Magneto movie. And in light of the fascinating Magneto storyline which constitutes about a third of First Class, there is so much more that could be done with the character. Lehnsherr is presented here as a deeply abused and troubled man, torn between his anger, his desire for revenge and the promises of redemption from Xavier, his closest friend. Fassbender is terrific, more than equal to the performance of Ian McKellen in the previous films, and it's a great shame that we won't see his story fleshed out into a full feature. As much as I enjoyed First Class, I kept coming back to this. But I guess this doesn't amount to much more than nit-picking to most people, so really any fans of the series, or even just quality action movies, should check this one out."

","To begin with, I ll rate this movie with 6 stars only because it is an Xmen film, otherwise it would be less than 4...<br/><br/>The whole movie was kind of cheesy and 2 levels behind the previous ones. It was just an other cheap blockbuster with really weird mutants (they could have chosen some more spectacular mutants than the human kolibri (Angel Salvadore) or the screaming nerd (Banshee)... In addition, suddenly Professor X is British, Magneto has the ability to talk in every language (or at least in the official language of any country he visits...), and Mystique is just a cute kitten (with fat cheeks..). And they definitely should fire whoever was responsible for Beast's costume... I mean in a movie with such special effects (Emma Frost, Mystique etc) I was like LMAO when I saw Beast...(Teletubi meets American Werewolf) :)))).<br/><br/>I m not the biggest Xmen fan so I really cant judge too much about the storyline cause I don't know a lot about the actual story of the beginnings but I expected the relationship of Magneto and Mystique with Professor X to be a bit less friendly at the end. <br/><br/>About the characters I did not think that James McAvoy was a good Charles Xavier but Kevin Bacon as Sebastian Shaw and Michael Fassbender as Magneto were almost outstanding. I really liked January Jones alias Emma Frost a lot (I wish she would appear on the earlier movies too) .<br/><br/>Bottom line, it is worth to watch this movie and actually enjoy it only if you are an Xmen fan, otherwise I would suggest not to waste your time... disappointed.."
"k-v-ahuja","6","1","5","12 June 2011"," Didn't meet expectations of XMen Series
","I went into the movie expecting this one to top-off what earlier Xmen movies had done; but this one was not so exciting.<br/><br/>I guess the reason this one was slow, was because there was a lot of story building in the movie and it just spoiled it for me. I knew what Xmen were and also the ones that had the powers, so it was not a surprise. The real action is only towards the end, unlike the others where you see a lot of Mutant stuff from the very beginning.<br/><br/>But, one thing I did like was the introduction about some of the characters that we saw in previous movies and how they came to be and how it all began; it is good to see the ends meet and this one did take care of the beginning. <br/><br/>One thing on how the movie ended left me thinking if the writer has something up their sleeve and is there going to be some more between the First Class and the First Xmen - there are obvious gaps that can mean more movies that I am looking forward to."
"Reel_starz","7","1","5","12 June 2011"," X-Men: First Class, Second Rate
","I'll admit that I'm probably not the best person to be reviewing this movie. I've never touched any of the comic books on which the X-Men franchise is based, and though I've seen all of the movies thus far, aside from the overt ridiculousness of 2009's X-Men Origins: Wolverine, I've come away from each of them with an overwhelming feeling of ""meh"".<br/><br/>The premise is intriguing: superheroes – or mutants, as they are called here – are highly evolved humans whose extraordinary abilities and powers, instead of giving them the prototypical status as revered crime-fighters and saviors of mankind, alienate them from the rest of society. Their struggle to become accepted for who they are is used as an allegory for politically and socially relevant issues, most specifically, the gay rights movement. So, why does every movie seem vaguely disappointing, as though a great opportunity has been wasted? Is it just because I'm not part of the movie's target audience, which is pretty clearly those who are already familiar with the X-Men universe and mythology? Or have I simply set my standards too high, expected too much from movies that really just aim to be pure, cheeky fun? Don't get me wrong, X-Men: First Class has its moments, and as mindless summer escapism, it's not bad. There are thrills here and there, your usual bonanza of special effects, frenetic action sequences and eye candy, this time for both the guys and girls. A cameo by a certain beloved veteran of the franchise, along with an effective use of the one f-word allowed in a PG-13-rated movie, induced chuckles and a few whoops at my screening.<br/><br/>The talent assembled is fairly impressive, with original X-Men helmer Bryan Singer finally returning, albeit in a producer-only role, and a number of recognizable names available to grace the marquee, though many of them, particularly Jennifer Lawrence in her first major blockbuster, go underused, their characters and story lines feeling almost like distractions or hurried afterthoughts. As a wheelchair-less, pre-hair loss version of Patrick Stewart's telekinetic Charles Xavier, James McAvoy spouts evenly-stated aphorisms and saintly benevolence, but it's Michael Fassbender who stands out as tortured soul Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto. With his Jude Law good looks and an appropriately steely gaze, he grounds a film that often seems overly caught up in its revisionist, self-empowerment ambitions and provides the movie with almost all of its best scenes, including a tavern-oriented confrontation reminiscent of something from Quentin Tarantion's Inglorious Basterds, which is also on Fassbender's rapidly expanding resume.<br/><br/>In fact, beneath its glossy, very, very photogenic surface, X-Men: First Class looks oddly hollow. The use of the Cuban Missile Crisis as a major plot point fails to add any real weight to a story that is almost purposefully light and breezy. With the exception of Erik's past as the subject of Nazi experimentation, the backgrounds, relationships and motivations of the main characters are only thinly developed, and some events are either awkwardly structured or completely non sequitur; for example, there is a sex scene toward the latter half of the movie between Erik and Raven/Mystique (Lawrence's character), even though, prior to that moment, the two had barely exchanged a word, let alone any romantic chemistry. Furthermore, the movie often feels like merely a string of ""trailer-ready"" moments with its endless stream of one-liners and deliberately posed action set pieces. Like in his previous effort, Kick Ass, director Matthew Vaughn seems more concerned with style than genuine substance, and a bombastic score by Henry Jackman irritates more often than it builds tension or atmosphere.<br/><br/>In the end, though, it's not trying to be The Dark Knight. It provides two hours of solid, throwaway entertainment, and fans of the franchise as a whole will be pleased; they are already familiar with and invested in this world, so the dearth of character development will likely be less noticeable or problematic. And let's face it, when James McAvoy gazes at you from a 20-foot screen with those meltingly clear sky-blue eyes of his, it's hard to resist. I only wish the film-makers would stop settling for ""eh, it's good enough"" and strive for X-traordinary."

","There are some accusations here of mafia reviews to pump up the films viewability. I won't exactly agree with that conspiracy theory but after watching the film I have to say it's worth something to look into it.<br/><br/>I'd leave the acting, plot, character development and other technical aspects of the film for other reviewers to debate. The most alarming, and for that matter, disappointing, aspect of the film for me is its story. Where in Marvel Universe have they pulled this one out?!<br/><br/>I have a copy of Marvel's compilation of synopsis of the first X-men series (i already forgot the exact title of the comics) once, and this certainly was nowhere in those pages. i researched other materials online for traces of where they got this version of the X-men origin and i couldn't find any. if they are trying to stage a prequel to the first X-men series, at least they should have kept that story in mind and create a storyline that will make the two add-up.<br/><br/>The real First Class was Marvel Girl a.k.a. Jean Grey, Cyclops, Beast and Angel. they are the characters that shaped the early days of X-men. if they brave to create a story of X-men without Wolverine, they should have stick to the original material or at least give respect to it.<br/><br/>contrary to what the other reviews are saying, this take does not save the X-men franchise. it only succeeds in further entrenching the confusion and complications created by the first trilogy. it is far from being batman begins to batman.<br/><br/>Marvel Entertainment should reclaim rights to the X-men franchise and get Chris Nolan on board. Until then, i'm afraid I will continue to be disappointed by all these X-men outings that bastardizes instead of giving glory to one of the greatest comic book franchise of all time."
"silverwing-001","7","1","5","10 June 2011"," Not bad
","Overall its a decent action flick. Its got its ups and downs <br/><br/>Ups: Magneto's character was really well done. They did a really good job bringing out the tortured element of Eric without making him a wuss like *cough* Anakin Skywalker *cough*. The actor who played him did a pretty good job as well. The Action was great and kept you on the edge of your seat the whole time. It had a really awesome cameo (not going to spoil it) The historical aspect was well played The fictional history was well woven in with the actual history. Good Screenplay. The Tension between Charles and Eric was well done and it really shows the beginnings of their odd friendship. Which is essentially the main point so overall good stuff.<br/><br/>Downs: The Dialogue was quite cheesy (but then again it is a comic book movie). The Charles Xavier actor was poorly chosen and did not portray the mutant saint very well at all and was a disappointment.Kevin Bacon was laughable as the main villain. I mean literally laughable. Not in the Heath Ledger Joker awesome way, but the cheesy Adam West Joker way. The actress who played Mystique was poorly acted and the character was poorly executed. She is one of my favorite Mutants so seeing her portrayed like Bella from Twilight particularly got my goat.<br/><br/>There's more ups and downs, but I cant go further without spoiling it. Its worth seeing defiantly, just don't go in with high standards. Its way better than X-men: Wolverine and X-3. But it still doesn't hold a candle to X-2 or X-men. But it shows hope that the franchise can be saved after 2 horrible movies."

","Well after Thor, the pessimist in me was convinced that by the law of averages it had to be downhill for the rest of this summers superhero movies, well i'm really happy to report i was wrong.<br/><br/>This was a fantastic shot in the arm to the X Men franchise and a thoroughly entertaining film. Matthew Vaughn very cannily blends a cold war espionage tale into the fabric of a surprisingly emotional origins story. This is no mean trick and the two elements work well together.<br/><br/>The characters in the film are not one dimensional expositional figures. The film succeeds most in managing to put the audience inside the characters heads (not a Professor X joke) so their actions and reactions within certain scenes are understood and felt on an emotional level and are not just reduced to incidents that move the plot along.<br/><br/>The special effects are top draw and best of all, from the biggest effects to the more unnoticeable ones they all service the audiences experience and understanding of the films story. There is plenty of action in the film, but like the effects, its subservient to the story and not excessive.<br/><br/>The cast are fantastic, everyone of them brings something to their role, regardless of how much screen time they have. As i stated earlier, all the actors are largely to thank for drawing the viewer into a state of emotional understanding of their characters. A smart script and deft hand from director Matthew Vaughn provides a confident and competent foundation for this understanding also.<br/><br/>Bottom line, i think this well worth your money, no one can guarantee your enjoyment, but even a casual viewer would find it hard to dismiss a film such as this, which has been clearly made with a great deal of thought and care."
"quinnox-1","6","1","5","5 June 2011"," High expectations not met, but worth seeing
","I bought into the hype surrounding this, and unfortunately it was not as good as I had hoped.<br/><br/>The mutants were mostly boring, with the exceptions of Magneto, Professor X and Mystique. I thought some of the mutants powers were really lame too, like the mutant who had wings or the guy who could scream sound waves.<br/><br/>The makeup was very bad on a couple of the mutants, with the Beast looking like a big blue fur ball with a goofy face that made me chuckle. Azazel was funny looking too, with bright red makeup and looking like he bought a Devil costume for Halloween.<br/><br/>On the bright side, the performance of Michael Fassbender as Magneto was a highlight, and made the film worthwhile to see with cool powers and action scenes featuring him. He was definitely the most entertaining thing about the film. Professor X was good, but a little bit sanctimonious and preachingly sitting on a high pedestal to take seriously. I also liked Mystique, and felt the actress gave a good performance as the character, which was more interesting than many of the other mutants.<br/><br/>The Wolverine cameo was a brief throwaway scene and they shouldn't even have bothered. Overall, the special effects were well done and what you might expect from an expensive Hollywood film, so no complaints on that score. The ending is exciting and sets up a sequel nicely, with Magneto leading the evil mutants.<br/><br/>The movie has a goofy charm about it which makes it easier to overlook its drawbacks and I would recommend it to comic book movie fans."
"gigadragon12","7","1","5","4 June 2011"," Not the Dark Knight, but not Wolverine
","As we all know the genre of interest in the past decade has been superhero movies. They're probably the biggest most popular group of action blockbusters and if recent trends are any example we're about to get more of them than ever. So kick up your britches because if my personal expectations are accurate X-Men: First Class might be the last good superhero movie we get, before producers with money in their eyes take over everything.<br/><br/>X-Men: First Class (as if you need me to tell you) is about Professor Xavier and Magneto and how they united as the X-Men for the first time before the stories in the previous trilogy took place. Mystique is the only other X-Men that really gets a developed back story, and the others in the mutant cast are there almost as replacement for the more popular mainstream teams from the trilogy. It all takes place amid the mounting frustrations between the U.S. and Russia (because Watchmen proved that's the best sort of place for a superhero movie to take place, too bad the developers of this movie didn't quite understand why that was such a great setting) during and up to the Cuban Missile Crisis where the film takes its climax.<br/><br/>Let's cut to the chase, X-Men is good because it offers great action lets perhaps the most interesting X-Men in the original movies (come on who cares about Wolverine, am I right??) Professor Xavier and Magneto take the spotlight. Powers are shown off in nice cool ways, and they even had another bad guy step in to take Magneto's place, a role in which Kevin Bacon does very well. All the actors did great with their roles, especially the two main characters. If you liked the X-Men trilogy (or at least the first two) then you'll find more to love with this movie.<br/><br/>But this is by no means the next Dark Knight (as I've heard multiple people saying now) this movie is not an origin story, this movie is a prequel, and it quite visibly suffers from things that all prequels suffered from. First off, why does X-Men need a prequel? Because the third movie offered a crappy end to the first two movies? In a world where Spider-Man and Batman are already getting reboots to their story lines, why can't we just remake the third X-Men movie and actually make it good? Enough gripe about that though, this movie suffers from Prequel syndrome. While the story is centered around Charles Xavier and Magneto it doesn't do anything that's unexpected with the characters. Mystique even gets her storyline rehashed and set at an earlier date with little to no explanation of a background or anything. Its simply a movie about characters that already have detailed and finished story lines and this movie by no means attempts to mess up that cycle. This movie delivers all the character to the points they start at by the time the first X-Men movie roles around, and that, frankly, is incredibly disappointing.<br/><br/>I'd like to say that the character in the movie are so extravagant and well played that that doesn't matter, but for a two hour long movie almost none of the characters get as much development as they deserve, they're like the little electronic cars that some of us to play with as kids, they're predestined to circle around the track right to where we expected them to be. This isn't like the Dark Knight this is like someone made a prequel to the Batman Begins explaining exactly how Bruce's parents made him and why they were destined to got shot in that alleyway. There's almost nothing there to tell that hasn't already been said, and everything else they try to do with them are just curves in the track making sure the warm-up is all said and done before the actual plot begins with the first movie made way back when.<br/><br/>Look, as much as I want to like this movie, its simply just another X-Men movie. If you are fine with that than so be it, but don't fall into the trap that so many people are. Just because they made two bad movies before this one doesn't mean that this mediocre rehash is the next gold bar on the pile.<br/><br/>I give it 7.5/10"

","X-men First Class is a great movie, and an intelligent one. I didn't go in with high hopes after seeing X-men Origins: Wolverine, so this was an amazing movie. I think that's why I enjoyed it; I didn't go in with high hopes, and the blend of action and great characters made it what it is.<br/><br/>I've never been a fan of X-men, so I found myself a little lost and not making connections to the other movies, but I took little notice of that. The special effects were amazing, and it was a smart movie (unlike some movies out there)Also, how the historical events fit into the movie was really interesting and cool (I can't say much more without a spoiler)<br/><br/>Here's my breakdown: Special effects: superb. Acting: Pretty good. Story: Surprisingly fresh. This is the best X-men movie so far, and you can go in knowing nothing, and come out thinking it was pretty cool."
"fb-71-24509","7","1","5","4 June 2011"," First class story not dominated by special effects
","X Men First Class is the latest offering in the x-men franchise. This film goes back to before the previous films and shows us how the x-men were discovered and how Professor X's academy is formed.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed this film as it took a deviation from the traditional style of flashy CGI and special effects and, instead, has focused on an interesting and engaging story which uses the Cuban missile crisis as a sensational backdrop. In fact, in places, the film appears of a low, almost dated, quality which only acts to enhance the piece. Michael Vaughn has expertly interwoven the rise of the x-men into this not-so-familiar important aspect of world history in such a way that it is not only inspiring but also informative. The depth of the story going back to the torment of Erik's youth brings with it a dark and, at times, disturbing feel which makes this piece slightly gritty and all the more solid. I was surprised by the 12A certificate, generally feeling that a 15 certificate would have been more appropriate.<br/><br/>The performances by the up-and-coming cast are good and for the most part believable. There are certainly no Oscar winners here, but that is more to do with no one cast member standing out due to the shear breadth of story to get through. The casting of James McAvoy as Charles Xavier is truly inspired. He provides a depth to the film which beds in nicely with the story, although a stronger performance would have provided that anchor his character needed to have. This brings me to my main criticism of the film. Taken on its own, this is a perfectly enjoyable piece, however, if watched in the context of the previous films it brings on a new life as there are many subtle links to the wider story which make it engrossing. At over 2 hours long, there is just a little too much meandering of the story to include these links; it doesn't do this a lot, but just enough to detract from an otherwise sensational film. I would have liked to have seen a little more character development from some of the supporting cast as these actors are going to be filling our screens for years to come, and in this film, they were more there as padding.<br/><br/>Having said that, as a non-X-men fan boy and someone who hasn't read the comics this is a perfectly good stand alone film and an excellent addition to the x-men franchise. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Definitely a ""one to watch"", with performances from ""ones to watch""."
"MrBubblesFtw","10","1","5","3 June 2011"," Ties up all the loose ends
","So I just came back from watching this movie like, ten minutes ago and this is the best Xmen movie in my opinion. This movie answers much of the questions I had about the series before watching this movie such as how Magneto got his helmet, why Professor X lives in a wheelchair and how Celebro (or however you spell it) came into Charles' possession.<br/><br/>This movie has good, convincing actors, a nice plot and dialog. But there are also a lot of really cliché moments in the movie, mainly at the end which is why it gets a 9/10 instead of a 10/10 :D the soundtrack was also really good, sounded a lot like Hans Zimmer's Inception though :("
"CSHaviland","7","1","5","3 June 2011"," Pretty good contextual movie
","Better scripted than X-Men: The Last Stand, and about equal with X-Men Origins: Wolverine. So by that rule of thumb if you hated the Wolverine movie then you'll probably hate this one; if you really enjoyed the Wolverine movie (as I did) then you have a good chance of enjoying this one. It created a good context for Magneto's behavioral origins, as well as his use of power. I thought that was well thought out. <br/><br/>Unfortunately they compromised their quality script with a glaring continuity problem -- Charles Xavier is in a wheelchair by the end of this movie, which takes place in the 60's, but he was seen in another movie as a much older Professor X (Patrick Stewart) walking... I'm not referring to his walking in a telepathic state, as in the original X-Men movie, but actually walking in a flashback to the '80's in X-Men: The Last Stand, when he and Magneto discovered Phoenix. <br/><br/>So either the filmmakers were ignorant of this issue (which is surprisingly possible -- you'd be frightened to learn how little some filmmakers know about the material they are assigned to direct or produce or even write!), or they chose to ignore this continuity problem (as many filmmakers do), or they plan on having him walk temporarily at some point later in life, in some fashion that will be explained... But I doubt the latter. It's more likely that the filmmakers decided to do what ever they wanted to do, and believe that their own story shouldn't be confined by any franchise continuity -- it's an ego thing, not a logical thing. Happened in Star Trek all the time. Could also be that they decided they hated X-Men: The Last Stand and chose to ignore just that particular movie, which is also not unprecedented. (The makers of Jaws: The Revenge chose to ignore Jaws 3-d, but it was just as terrible.)<br/><br/>But if you are willing to look past that, this is well worth seeing at the theater."
"anders-rock","7","1","5","3 June 2011"," Entertaining and engaging
","The first X-men movie was great. X2 was even better. The Last Stand was a big let down and the Wolverine spin off I haven't bothered to see yet. So this would either be the final nail in the mutant coffin or a much needed revival of strength. It turned out to be the latter. The best part was definitely James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender. I enjoyed every second they had on screen separately but together they were pure gold. They echoed the equal genius of Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen in the previous films and they didn't try to imitate them but instead made their own interpretations of Professor X and Magneto. Kevin Bacon was also a nice and evil pig of a villain and I had never seen Mystique be this interesting before. Beast and Azazel were cool too. However I didn't really connect to the younger recruits like Havok and Banshee then again I didn't connect with Cyclops or Storm in the previous films. The action was pretty good. The final battle in particular was a feast for my eyes. The thing I feel could have been better was the pacing. It was just a little too fast. I barely had time to get to know the characters. That aside this was an effective popcorn flick with some good action and a well executed story."

First class could be an event right out of a comic it keeps you entertained without having to resort to lots of big fancy expensive scenes or annoying dialog. All the X-men act like their characters are suppose to from the comic. They had a good mix of mutants, some everyone will know, some only the hardcore fans will recognize, but all are presented without being over-introduced, but in such a way that anyone could walk in and enjoy the movie. I was terribly impressed with all the performers in tackling characters that so many people know so well and have such high expectations of. The writers managed to have a completely separate film that works on it's own while still making a nod and acknowledging the other films. The effects were well used and did not come of as overused or gimmicky. Totally worth seeing and enjoying."

The acting was very good and effort was made to make you care about the fate of the characters. It also fitted it's time-line well with many real historical events of the era being integrated into the plot. It lays the groundwork for a sequel and based on this, hopefully with the same team!<br/><br/>One thing i did notice was M Fassbender's Irish accent come to the fore a bit more near the end of the movie, it was more neutral during the first half.

","I enjoyed this X-men very much because of the script and performances by the two leads. But there was something missing I thought, and realized what it was after watching the old X-Men films after coming home from the theater.<br/><br/>X-Men First Class had some epic sets, and some very good CGI, but the pacing was off, and at times looked cheap. The direction was OK in some spots when it came to the pure shots, and cinematography, but the story felt choppy. Scenes ended too fast at times and there just was no atmosphere in this film. It was as if cheap cameras were used to film this, with no camera filters. It almost had the quality of a Smallville type television series. Or even Heroes...it felt like it was made for basic TV. The word Epic can't be used to describe this film even though I'd like to call it epic.<br/><br/>Anyhows, I'm a big X-men fan, and wasn't let down. The story was pure X-men, basic, and an origins story, and so no surprises in this one. Magneto was written in a way that made him less hated. Xavier's character was played very well, and had some charm to go along with the wisdom. I also thought the score was good at times, and sometimes sounding like Parade music. The Marvel films need better scores in general, and it's as if this movie was influenced somehow by Disney. The best way to sum it up is like this. The old X-men films felt more like the new Batman films, and First Class felt more like the Tim Burton films. I just think it's tough to call this the best X-men film of all time. I don't think it is."

"a-fundamenski","6","1","6","4 June 2011"," The younger Xavier-Lehnsherr rivalry is eclipsed by an origins screenplay that spreads its characters over too much story.
","Let's face it. Prequels are made for one reason: because it's cool to see where established legends come from. It's all about the moments, those periodic origin instants that reveal how a certain piece of lore of the franchise came into being. And the smiles those moments draw. But you always have to keep in mind that we're here because of the familiar, and it's up to the filmmakers to use the familiar as a foundation to produce the same amount of memorable moments as its source. X-Men First Class, directed by Matthew Vaughn (Kick-Ass) and distributed by Twentieth Century Fox, regretfully doesn't make good on that promise of a prequel; it doesn't give you the moments and, while overall fun and fresh, not as many smiles as you'd hope.<br/><br/>First Class begins full circle, returning the film franchise to 1944 Poland, where Erik Lehnsherr pries a gate off its hinges as the Nazis separate him from his parents. A less than pleasant encounter with the villainous Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) unleashes the rage dwelling inside the future magnet, and Lehnsherr sets on out a warpath of vengeance. Flashforward to the Sixties. Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) is something of a magnet himself, a charismatic charmer of the opposite sex with McAvoy commanding the character, and notably both his legs, with vibrancy we've never seen before. Though I wish he was a little less sure of himself – too often he appears as wise and experienced as his older self — the pre-paraplegic professor's performance is the highlight of the picture.<br/><br/>From there, the script becomes much too cluttered. Sir smooth-talking, who has befriended the blue doppelganger Raven / Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence), crosses paths with Lehnsherr, and with help from Agent Moira (Rose Byrne) they track a team of mutants to combat Shaw and his icy temptress played by January Jones. But between Xavier and Lehnsherr, which are the only two characters you really care about, the villains, and the team of young mutants, far too many faces make it impossible for the mildest emotional attachment. The slimy Sebastian Shaw plans on starting World War III by coercing the Russians into militarizing Cuba. Clever as it is that the movie interweaves historical fact with fiction, the Cold War context is lost in a screenplay that's already juggling half a dozen characters and their origins.<br/><br/>What I found extremely tiring was the geographic jumping from Germany to London to America to Russia to London to America to I'm sure there's a few other locales I'm neglecting. It's literally all over the place, and reminds me of the first twenty minutes of The Bourne Ultimatum. Even more perturbing are the patronizing subtitles indicating a location alteration every two minutes. Snow = Russia. Beaches = America we get it.<br/><br/>Yet another issue: the origins themselves. Again, the point of a prequel is that it reveals how a recognizable icon of the series comes into being, and that it does so intuitively. One obvious example would be names the aliases of all the mutants, strategically and intelligently woven into occasional puns. Ready for disappointment? Because in First Class it's literally someone saying, ""Hey, we should give ourselves nicknames I'll be Mystique, you'll be Angel, he can be Professor X"" The imaginative effort employed is overwhelming.<br/><br/>By and large, Marvel's fifth mutation is an honest effort to show a younger, more innocent relationship between the Xavier-Lehnsherr rivalry, but an ambitious script spreads its characters over too much story, leaving you hungry for more. Apart from a notable cameo, X-Men First Class lacks all the magnetism of X2, and the latter half of its runtime rages with action that would've been more useful as character development. After all, that's the point of the prequel to see where established legends come from, but more importantly, how they come about. We know Magneto becomes the villain, we know that Xavier will we wheeling in a chair for the rest of his life. We want to know how these events transpire and how it affects these characters. We don't need to see the standard episodic 'end of the world' scenario because we know, as heroes, the X-Men will have their share of death-defying doomsdays. Alas, only frustration awaits. Don't get me wrong. As a stand-alone, it's good, solid fun. But it's not a stand-alone. It rests on expectations, and because of that, it disappoints to be anything but uninspiring and hardly mesmeric."

","The fifth installment, and prequel, to the hit X-Men series, is brought with a lot of back-story, a lot of action, and a lot of anticipation. ""X-Men: First Class"" tells the very beginning story of Professor Xavier and Magneto, and the organization of the mutants. Now, I have never seen the other X-Men movies, frankly because they didn't feel interesting to me. But since watching ""First Class"", I enjoyed it completely, and it was a super movie. This is so far, one of my favorite superhero comic book movies, because it was thrilling to watch on screen, and everything keeps my attention. I was able to be entertained throughout the whole movie, besides the 132 minute run-time. Matthew Vaughn made impressive directing duties, and the script, that he co-wrote, was managed perfectly to recreate Stan Lee's colorful vision. But, the performances are something to die for. James McAvoy portrays a brilliant role as Young Professor Xavier, Michael Fassbender plays an excellent role as Young Magneto, Jennifer Lawrence is superb as Mystique, January Jones brings a sexy-driven performance, Rose Byrne is intelligently super, and Kevin Bacon does an excellent job at playing a villain. This incredible ensemble, is the best I have seen in superhero movies. Also, the editing and cinematography is pure genius, the music is exhilarating, the action is non-stop, and the visual effects are amazingly breathtaking. ""X-Men: First Class"" is one of the most incredible comic book superhero movies I have ever seen, and it's one of the best movies of 2011, by far. This movie is enjoying, thrilling, and it's so super to watch again and again. ""X-Men: First Class"", in my review, ""one of the most excellent superhero movies ever""."
"mikefirth65","Null","1","7","14 July 2011"," Embarrassing
","This film was shamefully bad.<br/><br/>While watching it I noticed a look of embarrassment on some of the actors faces.<br/><br/>The story didn't make any sense. Particularly the ending, which was totally unbelievable and could have been written by a child.<br/><br/>The sets and costumes looked cheap and artificial. Particularly Beast, when he appeared after his transformation the whole auditorium collapsed in fits of laughter. I'm sure that wasn't the intention of the film makers.<br/><br/>How could they mess this up so badly. A crime against the X men franchise and cinema generally."
"gregeichelberger","5","1","8","8 June 2011"," 'X-Men' origins interesting, but falls flat in some areas
","So after a half dozen ""X-Men"" franchise movies we find out that Magneto started off in a death camp and Professor Xavier was a playboy nerd. Not much inspiration to build a successful graphic novel film base on, yet -in many ways - the newest installment, ""X-Men: First Class"" does deliver the goods.<br/><br/>In other aspects, however, it falls far short of its goal.<br/><br/>Taking over the directorial duties for this one is Matthew Vaughn, the British veteran of such pictures as ""Layer Cake,"" ""Stardust"" and ""Kick-Ass"" (easily one of the worst movies of the decade). His inclusion here is a step down from original director Bryan Singer, but a definite step up from last two, Brett Ratner and Gavin Hood.<br/><br/>Newest version - following on the heels of the horrid ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" - seeks to show the beginnings of the mutant race, with Eric Lehnsherr/Magneto (Michael Fassbender, ""Inglorious Basterds,"" ""Jonah Hex"") locked up by the Nazis in 1944 Poland. Here, he sees his mother killed by Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) and he discovers his true potential to manipulate metal.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, on the other side of the Atlantic, Charles Xavier (James McAvoy, ""The Atonement,"" ""The Last King Of Scotland"") is postulating on his theory of genetic mutation as a way to pick up chicks in bars. His adopted sister, Raven (Jennifer Lawrence, an Oscar nominee for ""Winter's Bone"") tags along to keep her either somewhat grounded - or celibate.<br/><br/>Now, in 1962, Shaw - who looked 60-years old in 1944 but now is a cross between Austin Powers and Dean Martin's Matt Helm - has convinced the United States government to place missiles in Turkey and the Soviet Union to store warheads in Cuba. It's part of his rather confusing plan to start World War III so that his mutant allies can take over - or so it would seem.<br/><br/>Shaw's league features Emma Frost (January Jones, ""Ad Men""), Azazel (Jason Flemmying) and Riptide (Alex Gonzales).<br/><br/>Opposing him is Xavier, the shape-shifting Raven, a reluctant Lehnsherr and a batch of new mutations, including Beast (Nicholas Hoult), Angel (Zoe Kravitz), Havok (Lucas Till) and Banshee (Caleb Landry Jones).<br/><br/>One of the film's problems lies in the introduction of so many characters (in an effort to be faithful to the comic) that the development of any one of them is minimal. Thus, while the young mutations do get a certain amount of screen time, there is little, if any backstory, and they ultimately get lost in the clutter.<br/><br/>Plus, some of the powers of these individuals is non-threatening at best and completely laughable at worst. For example, Angel's mutation is that she grows butterfly wings, flies about like Tinkerbell and spits fireballs; while Banshee yells real loud and can propel himself through the air on sound currents.<br/><br/>A hilarious cameo, however, does take place during the search for the mutant sequence featuring a ticked-off Hugh Jackman. The addition of a group of ineffectual CIA and government agents led by Oliver Pratt does nothing for the movie's plot line, though.<br/><br/>Mixing fact and fiction, the film culminates during the Cuban Missle Crisis as Shaw makes a last-ditch effort to bring the world to the brink of nuclear war while the good mutants do their best to stop such an eventuality.<br/><br/>Story - for the most part - is solid, while CGI s credible, especially during the flying scenes and when Magneto attempts to hoist a huge submarine from the Cuban waters. Acting ranges from decent (Lawrence, Fassbender) to downright terrible (Bacon, Jones), but all eyes are on the action here, not the thespianism.<br/><br/>As far as that goes, ""X-Men: First Class"" delivers. Not 100 percent to this scribbler's satisfaction, but close enough for a slight recommendation."
"ConcreteStereo","5","1","8","8 June 2011"," Average movie. Typical time-passer.
","I went to X-men as a time-passer and it delivered more or less the expectation.<br/><br/>Though it touches on easy clichés and flat acting every now and then it is a solid event-based movie. A bit a 007 without the witty charm and self- irony but plus a varied range of comic book characters (both in human and a super human character).<br/><br/>For people who understand either German or French (and undoubtedly this'll be true for our fellow Russian-speakers too): expect some nerve-wrecking moments.<br/><br/>On the whole, a time-passer that won't leave you sitting on your chair in awe until the end of the titles, but won't leave you feeling too sorry for your money either. 5/10"

","Well, lets start with the good. Special effects were fantastic, as you would expect from this kind of film, locations were wonderful and beautifully shot, and as a prequel, it ticked all the required boxes, however, and yes there is a but....<br/><br/>BUT - the film never got you to a point where you actually cared about the characters. Sure, it fleshed out who they were and where they came from and what events made them what we saw in the previous two films, however, in this movie you just felt no real empathy for them.<br/><br/>This is not to say it was the actors fault, rather the direction, and the amount of ground they were trying to cover, while weaving in a plot that could be some what credible seemed to just bounce from place to place, and point to point without letting us get to any personal depth with the players.<br/><br/>So, for folks that love the franchise, then yep, you will enjoy this movie, for those who are wowed by special effects, again, great. But for those of you who want to care about the characters and what happens to them, not so much."

","This episode of the story of the X-Men is a prequel which tells the story of how the X-Men originally came together. The character development is good and the cast is impressive, though with considerably less resemblance to the personalities defined by Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen as Professor X and Magneto. It uses guile, and a swift script to interpolate on actual history to give gravitas to the future storyline. The false notes are that there are far too many mutants which often detracts from the storyline. The competitive advantages of some characters make them visibly more like demigods than as mutants, which reduces the overall tension. The combat, therefore, designed for exaltation mostly ends up feeling far-fetched."

The story is good, but written in a way that is not especially interesting. As for the technical aspect, we all know what to expect from Marvel production, and on that side I really have no complaints, but even visually film did not impress me (though I believe that it would have left a stronger impression if I saw it at the theater) and overall, it was on the verge of boring.

","This movie started well for me but fell through midway and I simply did not feel eager enough to continue watching it, like OK, will see the next half some other time. The simple reason is that it was not offering me anything more than the other X-Men movies I saw, other than the fact that they were trying their best to conjure up a credible prequel. I was kind of surprised to see the high ratings it got and felt like the superhero comic strip movies get rated higher than they should be (another good example being Avengers), as if this particular genre loving audience is still in the hangover mode and liking the same old wine in new bottles. I am eager to see something refreshingly new like it was when this Iron Man first came on screen or the Ant-Man, though not well made with a weak script, but still worth an effort. For me the Tobey Maguire Spider-Man trilogy by Sam Raimi still stands out the best superhero franchise till date. Nolan's Dark Knight series I don't even consider here, that's a totally different league. For X- Men: First Class, it gets a 5/10 from me."

","Released in 2011 and directed by Matthew Vaughn, ""X-Men: First Class"" chronicles the origins of the mutant superheroes and super-villains in 1962 when the US government decides to enlist the talents of people with superhuman abilities. This is before Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and Erik Lensherr (Michael Fassbender) took the names Professor X and Magneto and were friends rather than arch-nemeses. They and their teen team must stop the diabolical Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) from using the Cuban Missile Crisis to start a nuclear war to increase his power. Jennifer Lawrence appears as Mystique and Rose Byrne as Moira MacTaggert. Nicholas Hoult is on hand as Hank McCoy/Beast.<br/><br/>It's interesting to go back to the early 60s when Xavier and Erik were friends and observe how the team got started, not to mention the eventual rift (the story deviates from the comic, of course, although there are some similarities). McAvoy easily carries the movie as Xavier; and Fassbender is effective as Magneto (and more fitting than Ian McKellen). I prefer Lawrence to Rebecca Romijn simply because she's curvier and cuter. There's a cameo with Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and it's hilarious.<br/><br/>Most of the movie is decent espionage akin to James Bond, albeit with super-powers. Where the film shines is the entire last act and epilogue. The sequences on the island shore are very well done.

We also take a look at Professor Charles Xavier with hair in this and boy does he look good with hair. We also see him having a love interest in this which is also really cool. This movie contains a lot of action and it takes place during 1962 the year of the Cuban Missile Crisis when the Soviet Union was shipping nuclear missiles to Cuba until President John F.

","I must admit I am not a big fan of comic book adaptations. I would love to see one that recaptures the excitement of flipping through a comic book and recreates its unique visual aesthetics, but it hasn't happened yet. (Ang Lee's Hulk got closest what I have in mind, but unfortunately that film crumbled under the weight of its boring plot.) I found the campy ones (Batman Forever, Batman & Robin and the like) mildly entertaining, because at least they didn't take themselves seriously (unlike Christopher Nolan's Batman movies, which, in my opinion, completely miss the mark with their realistic angle that goes against the implausibility of a man flying around in a bat-suit). The one I've found the most engaging is Sam Raimi's Spiderman 2, mostly because the great chemistry between Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst.<br/><br/>X-Men, however, is something of an exception. Its premise is more acceptable for me, because its heroes are not just silly men donning laughable suits, and the various abilities of the mutants provide great opportunities for artists to unleash their imagination. Still, it doesn't mean that I am a fan of the franchise, and the first X-Men movie didn't get me hooked either. I liked the second one a little bit better, but the one that made me re-evaluate the whole series and gave me newfound appreciation for X-Men was First Class.<br/><br/>I can't really explain why. Maybe because I like back-stories. They usually add more depth to the characters and the overall story arc. Maybe because I like period recreations, when done well, and First Class does it well. Or maybe just because James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender are tremendous actors who always elevate a film several levels higher."

","After the lacklustre ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" and the very poor ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"", this is a magnificent return to form for the franchise. It's an absolutely brilliant film.<br/><br/>James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender make for extremely engaging leading men, wisely choosing to put their own stamps on the younger Professor Xavier and Magneto rather than merely emulating Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen's performances. Their relationship is fascinating and wonderfully acted by both men. It also highlights just how badly Wolverine and Sabretooth's potentially fascinating relationship was handled in the previous film. The film has a stellar cast overall. Kevin Bacon is suitably creepy and contemptible as Sebastian Shaw. Of the rest of the cast, the strongest performers were Rose Byrne as Moira MacTaggert, Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique and Nicholas Hoult as Hank McCoy. I adored Hugh Jackman and Rebecca Romijn's cameos and it was nice to see Michael Ironside, Ray Wise and Rade erbedija pop up in small roles.<br/><br/>It makes for the perfect prequel, very effectively illustrating the characters' early years and influences and how the events of this film impacted on their lives, making them the characters to whom we were introduced (on film, anyway) in ""X-Men"". This was done best in Magneto's case, followed by Mystique and Professor Xavier. It's certainly the best prequel that I've ever seen."

","You may know who they are, and after watching the three main X-Men films, you may have a good idea of what their histories are. But for the full tale of how Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr became Professor X and Magneto respectively, look no further than First Class, the true prequel to the film trilogy.<br/><br/>Even though character drama tends to take the front stage, this film still has a phenomenal share of action and spectacle. Most of these scenes are short and tight, but every character gets a chance to shine and show off their powers. The fights are frequent and fun, but with the Cuban Missile Crisis as the centerpiece, the stakes are ramped up really well, before reaching an inspiring climax.<br/><br/>However, much like the first couple of X-Men films, the action never really drowns out the story or characters. In First Class, the focus remains firmly on showing how the original mutants came together, sowing the seeds for the conflicts that would come in the future. Some characters have more development than others, but each one do have scenes worth showing, and enough attention is given to the main ones to make them stand out. The film covers a lot of ground, but it does so swiftly and attentively, so the storytelling becomes endearing and faithful.<br/><br/>This film is crafted with decent photography. A lot of shots are wide-angle, but the film is composed well. Editing can be a bit choppy in some parts, but is otherwise solid (the scene with the coin at the end is specially inspiring in the way it's cut). Some scenes have overlays and transitions that gives the film a more uniquely dynamic style. Acting is phenomenal; James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender are the most perfect choices for their characters since the days of Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen, and the rest of the cast pulls their weight well. Writing is okay. This production uses good-looking sets, props, and costumes. Special effects vary from being okay to being rather poor, but they are very well-conceived. Henry Jackman's score is excellent, and is especially wicked when Magneto is on screen.<br/><br/>Forget X-Men Origins: Wolverine. First Class is the most endearing and satisfying prequel to the series. It is densely-packed with action and storytelling, and in spite of that, it stands as one of the best in the franchise.<br/><br/>4/5 (Entertainment: Very Good | Story: Good | Film: Good)"

","The story takes place at the past, when Charles Xavier and Erik Lansherr are young and they team up to prevent the beginning of World War 3 that the evil mutant Sebastian Shaw is planning, in order to fulfill his dream, an earth beloging only to mutants. The movie is a prequel to the other x men movie series but it's not as good as the previous ones. The story line at the beginning is confusing as it is switching from one place to an other, from past to future. However the rest of the story is getting better, and the action scenes are quite good. The performances are good too, especially Fassbender as Magnito. So 5 out of 10, because it is a nice action movie, with some funny parts, but it resembles other action movies."

"willcundallreview","7","0","1","22 May 2014"," An X-Men prequel that lives up to it's future sequels
","Rating-7/10<br/><br/>X-Men: First Class is a X-Men prequel that boasts a lot of good acting, action and even some good old back stories to really bring the franchise back into the form it was in back in it's day. Parts can be dull but in any sense it is entertaining and the film really starts to get going and the ending is a fine one, the film is what I felt, a safely good film, and here below this introduction, is why I felt so.<br/><br/>The story can be a little long to get started and you may feel by the end that the film is also a little long with what is has, though in the end and specifically the ending really bring this film up and it gives you a good bit of a thrill in only the last few minutes of it. It contains some good action scenes as well and of course with the superpowers we see in the series, it introduces these powers in new people with all sorts of weird and wonderful mutations, just good fun to see them bits but the action bits balance it out well too.<br/><br/>James McAvoy does well here although I did feel sometimes he is not at his best and a case could be put forward that McAvoy doesn't do well in blockbuster high budget movies. Michael Fassbender is the true hero of this movie with his portrayal of Magneto, he controls every scene he is in and really beats the other actors in his scenes too. Actors such as Jennifer Lawrence and Nicholas Hoult do well but I didn't fell they were spectacular, great acting isn't expected from films like this but a little effort is needed definitely. <br/><br/>It is written pretty well and the script is solid throughout with smart lines but also intense wording that can make the scene even more exciting that it already is with the action. The effects in this are nice, not perfect but they do the job and you will see at the end with the numerous special effects needed that they are really well done, not just visually, but also movement wise. Finally it is also directed well, one that is very good as Matthew Vaughn seems to move them as if they are new but also bring back the good old X-Men we miss from the past.<br/><br/>It's main criticisms aren't in the acting side of this, it comes mostly from the story with it's, as previously said, slow start. The reason it harms this is because yes a little drama is always good even in a big action superhero blockbuster, but too much and then to take away the things the viewer wants to see, it just harms it, not very bad but it definitely harms a few key scenes here.<br/><br/>X-Men fans should enjoy this as it continues it well as a prequel but I think personally it ups the ante the franchise has and really sticks it to the ones before this and challenges it, well you might think that. I think people will like it if they like a good superhero movie that isn't afraid to hold back on the super big action, and have a little back story and build up, this really is for you indeed. Finally I think this is good drama and for budding actors, this could be one the few rare cases of big budget films, where you can actually learn a lot from the way they act.<br/><br/>Overall I give this a 7/10, it is Safely a Good movie, it isn't really near being VERY GOOD, but it is more than just a Kind of Good film. With this you have to watch with maybe a little history with X-Men, fans should love it, but also be a superhero fan, it is aimed very much at them and people from anywhere can enjoy it, but hero fans more. One more thing to say, I felt the budget wasn't used enough, they had a big big budget but seemed to hold back on certain aspects where more finance could have helped."

","When Bryan Singer left and made the Superman Returns movie instead of the third X-men film, he suggested Matthew Vaughn, who was then had only made Layer Cake, but Singer still thought there was something to him. It seems that he may have been wrong, Vaughn freaked out over the tight schedule and backed out. Five years later and Fox needed to pull together an x-men movie pronto, otherwise the rights would return to Marvel. The schedule was tighter than before, almost not enough time and the producers had no intention of offering the job to Vaghn who had titled a genius since then. Singer though was determined to see it happen and the director of Kick-Ass didn't back out this time around. Bringing together a production – almost from scratch – that doesn't just set the foundation for the whole series but expands it too is not easy. But with most prequel films, sequels, remakes money and lack of ideas are usually the motivations. Matthew Vaghn set out to make the impossible possible; making a film that at once had a point and also could set the stage for the X-men films already out there, and could also be the first brick in the wall of a new series. It's a two-sided plan and the film was just as two-sided. In 1944, in Poland, the boy Erik Lehnsherr unleashes his magnetic power when his mother is killed. In New York, the wealthy Charles Xavier meets the mutant Raven and invites her to live in his manor. In 1962, the CIA agent Moira MacTaggert and Professor Xavier recruit mutants to work for the USA government to fight the evil Shaw, who Magneto is itching to get revenge for killing his mother. Okay first off the legs it is standing on. When I first heard about the concept of First Class it looked like a semi serious teen flick with humor, love and action. This concept was tossed. Vaugh didn't leave out the teenagers but Bryan Singers story new take on the Kuban missile crisis made it more serious. Superhero movies don't usually like to leave the present – enough money is spent of the effects as is without adding the hardship of making the background look like a different era. First Class sticks with the 60s, and the atmosphere is reminiscent of conspiracy theory thrillers. The choice of actors was perfect. A young Charles Xavier played by James McAvoy and Erik Lehnsherr is played by Michael Fassbender only good things can be said about the two of them. Kevin Bacon is a great baddie, but I can't get over the fact that the film is almost Wolverine free. The problems start with the other characters. If it's not bad enough that there are too many of them, but they are shallow and can only be categorized by their powers and which side they are on. 132 min. at first seems like a lot, but the film has so many characters, that there ends up being no time to know the motivation of a few main characters. The special effects too are a little disappointing, and there really isn't much action in it to begin with. Another painful deficit is the lack of blood, a few scenes are just play ridiculous without it. The whole thing just becomes too sterile. Of course with any prequel, First Class looks to tie itself in with the other films – with a few cheeky jokes that are sometimes funny but are mostly just desperate attempts at humor. With all its mistakes and things its lacking First Class has heart, power and brains, now it just needs some experience and patience to grow up to the level of Singer's classics. So to me it's a little better than average. I'm sure that its biggest problem is that I thing the old series is the etalon. 6/10 Max - https://www.youtube.com/user/silverscreenreviews1"
"Joxerlives","7","0","1","18 May 2014"," A surprisingly entertaining rewriting of history
","Must say I read the X-men avidly as a kid but gave up on the films as they were largely aimed towards 15 year olds which I no longer was. I was intrigued enough by this one however as it was back to the team I remember from my youth and I wondered how they would fit in with real history 'Dark Skies' style? I'm really glad I did as it turned out better than I could have hoped for. <br/><br/>January Jones is beautiful in a very Nancy Sinatra kind of way and Jennifer Lawerance equally good as Mystique, her conversion from Dr X's fangirl into Magneto's disciple is excellently handled, you totally buy it, especially the naked confrontation between her and a very bashful Dr X in the mansion's kitchen (the film certainly has no qualms about exploiting the beauty of its' female stars). 2 wonderful cameos, a very clever one with Rebecca Romijn as the older version of Mystique and a scene stealer from Hugh Jackman as Wolverine telling Dr X and Magneto where to get off. Certainly doesn't lack spectacle either, the climatic battle is Jutland with superpowers (but neither fleet seems to deploy any aircraft?). <br/><br/>The bad? Glaring anachronisms especially in terms of weaponry, both the US and the Soviet forces using hardware which they wouldn't develop until decades later. It rather beggars belief that the CIA would infiltrate a military team into the Soviet Union dressed in US uniforms and carrying American weaponry because they're trying to AVOID World War 3? Also a little disappointed that they kill Darwin off just so quickly and arbitrarily, I guess the black guy really does always get it first? Then again this is the 1960s, the film really misses an opportunity to address the issue, maybe the authorities try to segregate the X-men by race and they all gather together to demand equality? <br/><br/>So all told very good and I might just go to see the current X-man film."

","(Credit Twentieth Century Fox) Before Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr took the names Professor X and Magneto, they were two young men discovering their powers for the first time. Before they were archenemies, they were closest of friends, working together, with other Mutants (some familiar, some new), to stop the greatest threat the world has ever known. In the process, a rift between them opened, which began the eternal war between Magneto's Brotherhood and Professor X's X-MEN.<br/><br/>After two terrific movies, they hit a wall with X-Men: The Last Stand. The Wolverine films are fine entertainment as stand alone films, but a reboot of sorts was needed. They went the prequel route here. As far as entertainment is concerned? This movie delivers in that aspect; however. I thought it didn't delve nearly enough emotionally like it should have. I didn't care for some of the characters. Angel, Azazel, Emma Frost, etc. I know they tried to inject new life into the X-Men series by adding new characters, but they just felt there to me and rather disposable. Erik (Magneto) had a background story that had a lot of potential to be riveting, and it was to a certain extent. I just felt they didn't delve deeply enough like they should have. The friendship between Charles and Erik isn't anywhere near as potent as the film would like you to believe. They felt like strong acquaintances more than anything else. The action is where this film truly delivers. Those that love action won't be disappointed in the slightest. The finale is especially exciting. Performances are great, can't deny that. James McAvoy is uncannily good as a younger Charles Xavier. I don't know if Patrick Stewart saw this film or not, but he'd be impressed, I bet. Michael Fassbender is very good for the most part, but more angst would have been nice. I'm probably being a bit too finicky with this, but that's my only carp about his performance. Jennifer Lawrence is tremendous as Mystique/Raven. Kevin Bacon is effectively sinister as Sebastian. He is beaten rather weakly in all honesty tho. Hugh Jackman has a brief cameo that winds up pointless. It was rather illogical as well. January Jones is actually solid, but I didn't care for her part. Rose Byrne isn't given enough importance for my liking, even though her role is substantial. Hoult and the rest of the cast are fine. <br/><br/>Overall thoughts. <br/><br/>I was entertained, but not exactly impressed. It was a bit too shallow at times for my liking. That being said, it does fly by for a film that is over two hours long. It's definitely worth a look. I'm looking forward to the upcoming collaborative film, X-Men: Days of Future Past. <br/><br/>7/10"

","""Let's just say I'm Frankenstein's monster and I'm looking for my creator"" – Erik Lehnsherr<br/><br/>After the weak finale to the original trilogy and the shambles that was Wolverine's origins story, fans of the X-men universe would be more than entitled to feel apprehensive, perhaps even disinterested when plans to bring Professor X. and Magneto's back-stories to the big screen were announced. However, Bryan Singer was back on board as a writer and producer, and Matthew Vaughn was directing after enjoying success from critics for his work on ""Kick-Ass"". The result was astounding; a refreshing take on a series which had become littered with bit-part, pointless name-droppers, increasingly poor attempts at bad-ass one liners, and a worn out Wolverine who was carrying the series upon his beefy shoulders far too often. Everything from casting to score just worked in this film, not without its flaws/ weak points, but it must certainly go down as one of the greatest comic book films made to date, especially in the Marvel universe.<br/><br/>In a familiar opening scene, a young Erik Lehnsherr's traumatic experience at the hands of the Nazis is revisited, this time introducing the icy, concise, ultimately powerful mutant, Sebastian Shaw. Erik awakens to his metal bending powers when Shaw murders his mother in front of him, showing that rage acts as medium through which his powers can be channelled. Elsewhere we see the juxtaposed, light-hearted story of the brilliant young Charles Xavier, and his childhood friend, Raven. An adult Lehnsherr's lifelong quest is to pursue and exact his revenge on Shaw, and when Xavier aligns with the US government to track Shaw (who is planting seeds to start a world war), the two young men meet and become fast friends. From here on out, the mutants become embroiled in the Western effort to prevent nuclear war during the 1960's Cold War era, whilst Shaw and his team use their abilities to force both sides hands into destroying humanity; then the world can belong to mutant- kind.<br/><br/>Whilst the story of First Class remains largely unoriginal (evil mutant intent on ridding the world of humans), its presentation is what sets it apart from previous X-men films. Where we had dilution of the story and the principle actors in previous efforts from secondary characters (Storm, Sabretooth etc.), the ""sidekicks"" in First Class have a genuine part to play in moving things along, and keep the film running at an appropriate pace, rather than slowing things down. At times, the young mutants-in-training detract from the darker tone of the film, which is slightly off putting, but bring colour and vibrance to other areas. The training scenes at Xavier's mansion in particular are artistically stylish, with each mutant's character being developed both physically and mentally in preparation for the films enthralling conclusion. A special mention goes out to Jennifer Lawrence, who, along with a much deeper script dragged Mystique from an underused piece of VFX eye candy into a commanding and dominant character, her chemistry with the rest of the cast is excellent, particularly Nicholas Hoult's Beast. On the side of the villains, January Jones also brings more substance behind Bacon's Shaw as indestructible telepath Emma Frost, which was something largely missing from Magneto's Brotherhood in the original trilogy.<br/><br/>However, the genius of this film lies in the casting of Michael Fassbender and James McAvoy as the films protagonists. The chemistry between the pair is on par with Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen, amplified by a far more mature and darker script, rife with room for emotional expression between the two. It's not often that the Superhero genre is graced with acting of such quality and profundity, and these two deliver in abundance. For reference, the scene where Xavier connects with Erik's mind at the mansion is one of the most powerful scenes I've seen on film, graced by a beautiful score from Henry Jackman.<br/><br/>Kevin Bacon also performs ably as a villain, something that few could have predicted, however his scenes in the early stages of the film are much stronger, particularly those involving young Erik Lehnsherr (maybe it's the German language scenes). He gets a little lost in the exploration of Xavier and Erik's struggles late on, and is a little over-shadowed by their prominence at the conclusion, which was probably necessary for the story, but was ultimately a shame.<br/><br/>A stand out factor in First Class is its score. In previous X-men titles, this has either been non-existent or larger than life and a little silly in places. Henry Jackman aligned his music with the darker tone of the film however, bringing elegant strings and upper register piano to poignant moments, and merging brass lead lines with dubstep/ electronic elements for action scenes. Like the score from ""Inception"", Jackman also brings the electric guitar into a classical score in a style that just seems to work for creating a crisp edge whilst retaining majesty.<br/><br/>X-men: First Class probably lacks the depth of plot and a better element of finality for its primary villain (though arguably the show is meant to be stolen from Shaw by the real villain in the X-men universe) to be considered a classic film, before even addressing the fact that it is a comic book adaptation. However, a darker tone which in places draws from ""Batman Begins"", a refreshing setting complete with cold war espionage tactics and stylish news segments, a fantastic score and genius casting/ acting makes First Class, for me, one of the greatest comic book film adaptations ever."

","Finally X Men movie thats worth screaming and shouting about. I have always liked the whole idea and explanation about the mutant theory in X men films/cartoons.

Quality storyline, with some strong mutants that actually are powerful unlike the Wolverine movie(2013).

"sowyau","10","0","1","25 June 2013"," An Excellent Beginning of X-Men movies
","For those who debate on whether the latest turnout from Marvel's Mutant is a reboot or prequel, will whole heartedly agree that it need to be better than the last dismal X-Men Origins: Wolverine (Hood, 2009). In fact the feral mutant feature tarnished the X-Men movie brand so badly, it needed Logan's superhuman healing ability to revive the X-Men franchise.<br/><br/>For that noble reason, we go back to the 1940s and 60s, where we find out more about the two pivotal mutants. Before the principal of X-Men known as Professor X, he was Charles Xavier; before Magneto becomes the magnetic field controller, he was Erik Lehnsherr. First Class tells the story of the early years of two most influential mutants, how the young Charles met the blue shape shifting Raven, who became his few and far between best friend; meanwhile somewhere in German concentration camp, Erik was one of million victims of Nazi's atrocious regime. <br/><br/>﻿20 years later, follow by years of Nazi's imprisonment, the vengeful Erik search and trackdown his all-powerful evil guardian Sebastian Shaw (played by the evergreen Kevin Bacon), Kevin played the new villainous Sebastian, the leader of another mutant group, known in the comic as Hellfire Club. Kevin Costner starred in Thirteen Days (Donaldson, 2000) may have presented a more historical accurate version of the Cuban Missile Crisis, First Class certainly re-creates the more intriguing alternate history by interlacing the involvement of the X-Men in the notorious Cuban Missile Crisis. The war between Homo Sapiens and Homo Superiors is always been the backbone of X-Men movies, the leaders of two mutant groups, who fight for the same course. i.e. to protect their own kind against the human's onslaught and discrimination. The subtext of skepticism in self-acceptance is even more noticeable in the subplot of Mystique and Beast. ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ Here in First Class, we witness the first of many to come encounters between Charles and Erik, mind you, it is not all sparks and flares when two of them met, by contrary, they share some of the tear jerking moments such as where Charles delves into the fond childhood memory of Erik in order to amplify his metal control ability. The truth is, there are more than enough material to make a feature length movie about Erik and Charles, let alone the inclusion of Sebastian Shaw and the first ever intake for Xavier's School for Gifted Youngster, hence bring us the movie title, X-Men: First Class. Rising stardom actors James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender wear the Cerebro device with ease as they handle their roles as the young Charles and Erik convincingly. Their hands are not tied by the need to impersonate the older counterpart characters in the movie sequel. However, rest assure that you will be able to relate them to Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen as you re-visit the sequels.﻿﻿<br/><br/>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿Take my review with a pinch of salt if you only want to hear from a die-hard comic X-Men fan, be that as it may, I do not have a faint idea whether this movie is faithful to the comic. All I knew is, in some aspect, it is slightly contradicted timeline in previous X-Men movies, does it matter to me? No, when I witness the cameo which is many times funnier than Stan Lee The Marvel Comic God. Does it upset me when they contradicting the age of Moira MacTaggert as in X-Men 3? I forgot about it when I look at the amazing bar scene where Erik tracked down the Nazi ""pig farmer"" and ""tailor"", a heart pounding built up suspense before one of them makes the first move. ﻿ What makes First Class so special is, there is a collective of indie aura, a seductive 1960s vibe attach to it, suspiciously due to the teaming of director, the Brit Matthew Vaughn and Jane Goldman the co-writer. It reminds me of Vaughn's Kick-Ass (2010), another comic book adaptation movie whom leaps out of the big studio artistic confinement. It does not only rely on money shot climatic battle, the way Charles and Erik compliment other so well, I will watch it even without the the sub-plots of young mutants' recruitment and Sebastian Shaw orchestrating the nuclear war. <br/><br/>Unlike most superhero comic movies, It belongs to the same Superhero comic movie hall of fame, along side with Christopher Nolan's two Batman movies and Bryan Singer's double X-men. Yes, you heard me there, it is THAT inspiring! Hey, all the while I thought in a X-Men movie universe, it is a cardinal sin without Wolverine playing the main lead, well, I was gladly wrong. What happen next with this exciting beginning, there are lots of potential to be fulfilled, uncharted territory can be explored. Let us celebrate the re-born of the franchise, roll on First Class: Graduation Year.<br/><br/>My movie review at www.sowyau.blogspot.com/"
"Gambitt","5","0","2","9 April 2013"," Disappointed by disjointed pacing and lack of development
","After being immensely disappointed during my initial viewing, I took it upon myself to give X-men: First Class a second chance, in light of how well others have regarded it. Sadly, my impression did not improve.<br/><br/>X-men: First Class, a reboot of the X-men franchise, provides a background story on the team's origin. The movie starts with the early upbringing of Charles Xavier (Prof. X) and his eventual nemesis, Erik Lehnsherr (Magneto) during World War II, and then jumps forward to the 1960s, when the X-men are formed.<br/><br/>The biggest problems in First Class were the disjointed pacing and woeful lack of development of the characters. Scenes unfold rapidly, and then cut abruptly. Relationships are implied without any actual foundation. Xavier catches the recruits partying up like brats after their first evening with each other; he sternly tells them he is disappointed in them. Why? He literally just met them a day or two ago. Shortly afterwards, we are supposed to be riveted by a loss and a betrayal, but again nothing is at stake because these characters have barely been introduced.<br/><br/>Yes, there is some character development for the two main protagonists, but it's hindered by an overall weak and superficial script. For example, when we first meet Prof. Xavier as a young man, every other line mentions mutants or genes. Ah-ha! He is an expert in mutation, see? We are constantly reminded by these shallow little references. Throw in a couple ""groovies"" to remind us of the time period. It all feels like lines an improv comedian would rattle off if told to impersonate a biogeneticist in the 1960s.<br/><br/>The movie also exhibits other hallmarks of sloppy and lazy writing. There is a grating scene in which the new mutants each shows off his or her own power and then provide names. It's the height of telling rather than showing. Later on, in the final showdown, two navies standoff while the X-men attempt to stop the villains' diabolical plan. Like any mediocre action movie, all the officers and crew of the world's two great superpowers stop acting or responding and instead join the audience, standing by idly while the main characters do all the heavy lifting.<br/><br/>Prof. Xavier and Magneto, for the most part, are simply portrayed as chums, without much development as to why they are close, particularly in the first half of the movie. It's not until about halfway through that we begin to see real dialogue between them, but even those lines are dull and predictable.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the criticism leveled at January Jones is warranted. She's just not strong enough of an actress to overcome her miscasting. And although I grant the movie makers broad leeway in straying from the comics, I agree with criticism that some of the characters changes are so drastic that there really isn't at any reason to have used that character at all.<br/><br/>All in all, I am disappointed by the missed opportunities. The movie could have delved much deeper into the psyche of Xavier and Magneto and the issues surrounding mutation. Instead, we are given cardboard cutouts and the dilemmas are presented in black and white terms. It's not the worst X-men movie, but that's only because The Last Stand was truly atrocious."

","X-Men: First Class is one of the best if not the very best X-men film ever released. Even though I liked The Last Stand and Origins, many people did not. This film will definitely bring the disappointed fans back into goodwill for this series. This film clearly defines what an X-Men movie should be. It has a convincing story, comic similarities, great acting and character development(which is important in X-Men), and a practical use of special effects(which were very good).<br/><br/>Matthew Vaughn's film is about the origins of the mutants and the story of how Professor X and Magneto met when they were young. This film takes place during the Cold War when Russia and the United States were facing their darkest times with each other.<br/><br/>This movie has a very good all-star cast and some younger actors who are quickly rising in fame such as the lovely Jennifer Lawrence. James McAvoy as X and Michael Fassbender as Magneto couldn't have been better for their roles. I must mention that Kevin Bacon makes a very convincing villain.<br/><br/>Overall, this is definitely one of the best X-Men films released to date. Matthew Vaughn has proved himself to be a very good, artistic director as he so proves her. For fans of the original series, they will love the surprise in this film. I know I did. I rate this film 9/10."

But all does not turn out well in the end, as Charles is paralyzed and he and Eric part different ways, Charles officially forming the X-Men while Eric becomes Magneto and forms the Brotherhood of Mutants. <br/><br/>That's basically the premise of X-Men: First Class, the astonishing prequel to the X-Men film series and the best and the boldest X-Men film in my eyes. Sure, it has had it's share of controversy when it was first revealed, but overtime, the public basically forgot all about the controversy and just enjoyed the movie for what it was. And what it was was a well written, well acted, well paced action piece that really fit the time it takes place in. Watching this movie, I forgot it was made in the late 2000s and thought it was made in the 60s. It has that incredible luring that sucks you in and really makes you feel like you are in the 1960s atmosphere. Everything fits incredibly well. From the footage of JFK, to Green Onions by Booker T and the MGs, to pinball machines, it really takes you back in time before James McAvoy became Patrick Stewart and Michael Fassbender became Ian McKellen. <br/><br/>Speaking of which, both actors steal the show head on. Both McAvoy and Fassbender as young Charles Xavier and Eric Lenscherr respectively really share a very brotherly relationship and you really feel sorry for both of them when they split up and become what they become. I really love how Eric is the most rebellious of the two and that Charles is basically the one in the background saying ""Eric, control yourself"", but that only makes their relationship even more interesting. You can't help but feel pity for Eric though, for the nefarious Shaw, played by Kevin Bacon, savagely murdered his mother right in front of him when he was a child. You can really feel his thirst for Shaw's demise, and it makes it even more powerful when he eventually does defeat Shaw, although Eric believes in Shaw's motivations that mutants are superior to humans. <br/><br/>I also loved Jennifer Lawrence as young Mystique. She's so sassy, slinky, and at times seductive, you can't help but drool over her. That Beast is one lucky guy! I also think Nicholas Hoult was a perfect choice for young Hank Mccoy aka Beast, although, I have to admit, his blue, furry Beast makeup looks a little silly and out of place at times. Luckily, he still retains the geeky, nerdy, ""sciency"" personality he's known for, and he kicks a lot of butt when fighting the teleporting Azazel. Even though this film lacks the original five Kirby X-Men (with the exception of Beast), it still has some pretty iconic and well developed X-Men to fill in the void. There's Banshee, the wailing mutant that will blow your ears off, there's Havok, the plasma blasting mutant that shoots cosmic hula hoops, there's Darwin, the adaptable mutant who can survive in any environment, and a very brief appearance by a certain claw slashing mutant that shall remain nameless.<br/><br/>One of the highlights of this film is the action. I think First Class has the best action out of any other X-Men flick, even better than the Statue of Liberty fight in the very first X-Men film. Once again, you get sucked into the reality, and you really feel like you are right there watching Beast, Havok, and Banshee beat the snot out of Azazel and Angel Salvadore. I also really enjoyed the final confrontation between Eric and Sebastian Shaw. Bacon portrays Shaw as such a maniacal villain, you just want to see him get his butt kicked, but his final fight with Eric was played out in a very straight forward, yet very effective manner. The music played during this scene and many of the film's action scenes is phenomenal. Kudos to Henry Jackman for making the score fit in with many of the film's emotionally charged scenes. <br/><br/>In the end, the only real thing I can complain about is that the film leaves you wanting more. It leaves you wanting to see how exactly this universe will progress, and how it will further tie in with the X-Men films that preceded it. I know an X-Men: Days of Future Past movie is in the works that has Stewart and McKellen returning as McAvoy and Fassbender's older counterparts, but for now, I will settle with this remarkable masterpiece that has driven my love of X-Men even further. I can't wait to see what happens down the line and to see how this new installment relates to the installments that helped make X-Men the pop culture sensation it is today. <br/><br/>Remember, the point between rage and serenity."

","This reboot of the X-Men franchise is completely different compared to the original trilogy, which I enjoyed until the third one. This X-Men movie has to be ranked as not only the best X-Men movie, but as one of the most underrated Superhero movies of all-time.<br/><br/>There is a massive human element to the film which I found different from all of the other X-Men movies and this is conveyed through the wonderful acting skills of the whole cast. The two lead actors, James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender have great on screen chemistry. Particularly Fassbender's performance of the broken Erik Lehnsherr before he becomes Magneto. Kevin Bacon is great as Sebastian Shaw, and he has the villain down to a tee. Jennifer Lawrence is perfect for the role of Raven, as she plays her in a troubled way, she just wants to be normal and not embrace her mutant self.<br/><br/>One of the aspects that make this movie enjoyable other than the acting is the Direction and the Music. Matthew Vaughn convey's a lot of emotion in his shots and this emotion is backed up with a fabulous musical score that helps to add to the mood.<br/><br/>This movie is fantastic and everything about it is near perfect and that is what makes it such an enjoyable movie, and one of the most underrated superhero movies of all time."

","So I've been holding on this for so long because i just couldn't swallow the fact that they made an x-men with completely new actors and not to mention a new director, looking up the movie's page here today, i found that the director had made a couple of other good movies so i decided ill just watch it streaming as an independent movie with no ties to the other x-men movies. i have also watched reviews so i knew as a movie it was on the good side.Let me start by saying the vision of this movie in an overhead view is great but the execution is what made this movie mediocre, the same type of problem i see in so many potentially great movies like this one which ends up forgotten and uninspiring. I'm starting to get tired of writing movie reviews and basically saying the same thing over and over. i went into this with low expectations and i have to say in hindsight that probably did help a lot; me not getting disappointed. A choppy storyline, incredibly stupid humor (i smiled maybe once in the movie), pacing that forces you to shut your mind off in order to enjoy the movie, pacing that of which only people with ADD would satisfy, come think of it the guy who made this movie probably has ADD. and script that is more pretentious than fake teeth, not to mention shallow and at times, bouncy as if you're watching Gilmore Girls. this movie is FILLED with one-liners so brace yourself for THAT. And having finished it i will probably forget in in T-minus 2 days, but i want to stress that thats a good level relatively for the movies i see coming out in recent years. Id give it a 7 (according to todays standards) , but not one decimal more."

If you research both comics and the x-men films in the last motion picture it demonstrates Charles and Eric aka Professor X and Magnito going to home of Jean Grey when she was a girl and Charles aka Professor X was walking, where as in the motion picture they have him in a wheel chair before he had met both Jean and Scott. In the comics and at least shown in one of the films he had met both Jean and Scott prior to his accident. The movie itself was very good, and does explain a few things as to how Raven and Charles met...it is informative but a bit contradictory, it does show however Scott aka cyclops and storm in the movie while he is locating mutants."

","I had never been a big fan of the X-men movies as I found most of them seemed to lack a powerful story, although the one thing that I found was that the relationship between Magneto and Professor X was intriguing to say the least. Why would a Villain like Magneto have so much compassion and by the look of it, a friendship with the leader of they antagonist Professor X. <br/><br/>Well now that has been answered with the greatest X-men movie yet hands down. This movie explains the origin and at the heart of it is a movie driven by character development and relationships the key one being between Eric (Magneto) and Charles Xavier (Professor X) as you see how they came to be friends and how they became the two key mutants of the future X-men series. <br/><br/>The pacing of the movie is superb and the story line is well written and keeps you interested throughout. <br/><br/>They often say that ""The Dark Knight"" was the first comic book movie that was seen as being not just a comic book movie, and I say the same about X-men first class, it is more then just a movie for people who are a fan of X-men and people that are a fan of comics, it is hands down a simply fantastic and well crafted film."
"simplemandudee","9","0","1","23 August 2012"," Absolutely fantastic.
","First Class is bar none the best X-Men movie. There is no arguing. In First Class, the viewer finds out exactly how and why the X-Men came to be in the first place. How Magneto came to be. Everyone loves a little back story right? <br/><br/>There are a few things that separate this film from the others of its kind. First and most importantly, it's the character relationships. The character relationships built in this movie is second to none. Seriously. I'm talking specifically about Charles Xavier and Erik Lehnsherr. It's something that you would have to see for yourself. There really aren't that many films with that kind of chemistry. Not love of course, but just their ""brotherly"" love. And that's just two characters. You also got Xavier and Mystique. Erik and Mystique. Come to think of it, Mystique is probably the one with most connections. <br/><br/>There are also scene sequences that will leave you with your jaw on the floor or make you go ""holy sh-"". The submarine and anchor scene. The submarine in mid-air scene. The coin through head scene. When Xavier gets shot. The missiles going back and forth. The contained explosion going down a certain someones throat. Also, who could forget the the little Wolverine cameo? And much, much more. <br/><br/>I don't know. It's something any person would have to experience. The film manages to mesh the X-Men with the supposed imminent start of WWIII flawlessly. The audience builds a strong relationship with the characters in the movie.. It's just.. great. This movie hits the bullseye in every category there is. Definitely one of my favorites."

","Remember the X-Men movie right before this one? You know, the one about the origins of Wolverine? I don't. My guess is that Hugh Jackman doesn't either. If he does, I can almost be sure that he's at least trying. ""X- Men: First Class"", directed by Matthew Vaughn, is a prequel that shows us how the presence of mutants became known to humans, and how they responded to each other's impressions. This can also be identified as a 130-minute apology to ""Wolverine.""<br/><br/>The film's first minutes are located in a nasty Nazi prison camp. The mother of young Eric is separated from him. He gets angry, and the steel gate between him and his mother seem to respond. (It's moving by itself!) This odd occurrence is immediately noticed by Sebastian Shaw, who later succeeds in forcing the power out of Eric by killing his mother. Once again in anger, Eric causes all sorts of metals to hurl through the air. The wooden chairs sigh in relief.<br/><br/>The sequence described above features the finest moments of ""X-Men: First Class."" It is there where we are introduced to the young man who will one day be famously recognzied as Magneto. Shortly, we recall familiar names such as Charles (Professor X) and Raven (Mystique), but not at first sight. There is a curious connection between the two. They seem to be really close to one another. So close, in fact, that we wonder about the lack of communication between them in the ""previous"" X- Men movies.<br/><br/>Read more here: http://localmoviereview.com/xmen-class/"

","Matthew Vaughn, who you might know as the director of ""Kick-Ass"", has done a wonderful job rebooting the X-Men franchise. I was incredibly captivated by the characters and the plot, and I found it perfect that it was about the Cold War. Sometimes it's hard to make a prequel because you might inadvertently create continuity errors, but with this movie, they mostly ignore the previous movies and instead focus on telling a new tale. And it works out great.<br/><br/>I felt this was decently cast. James McAvoy was a good Charles Xavier, but having his 'sister' be Jennifer Lawrence was a bit strange to me. (She's all sorts of perfect by the way.) Kevin Bacon was... interesting to say the least. I read that Bryan Cranston was the alternative, and now I kinda wish Cranston had been chosen.

","Honestly, the title says pretty much everything you need to know. This is, quite simply, a first class X Men movie.<br/><br/>It was the best X I've ever had. It rocks.<br/><br/>The original idea of the film was to be ""X-Men Origins: Magneto,"" and the final product didn't stray too far from that. Sure, there's a little bit on Prof X and the creation of the X-Men concept, but Magneto is pure class and easily steals the limelight.<br/><br/>We open with the scene from the first X movie, with Magneto in the concentration camp, ripping apart a metal gate to get to his mum.

Other then all that though I would have to say that first class is the best X-men Movie.. <br/><br/>I kinda hope that they make another one, something like X-Men First class 2, or X-Men Second class or something along those lines, Does anyone know if they are even thinking about making another one?

"spikey_jap","9","0","1","7 June 2012"," A Prequel That Brings Back the Excitement of the Franchise
","There are two sides to the X-men film franchise: the good side, which is ""X-Men"" and ""X2"" and the bad side, which is ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" and ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine."" The good side really brought the excitement and greatness of X-Men to the big screen and the bad side completely ruined the franchise. What this film actually did was making the story extremely enjoyable and bringing back the franchise to the same level of greatness of the first 2 films. This film did a great job of telling a story that connects this film to the others from the franchise and making it enjoyable for all. If you watched the good sides of the franchise, then you will be able to point out the resemblance and connect the dots that lead to the events of the franchise. You will get a better understanding of how the characters became how they were to be, giving strong feedback and enough depth to explain their ambitions and characteristics. <br/><br/>Director Matthew Vaughn not only did a great job of connecting this prequel to its predecessor, he developed a strong story that is enjoyable for both fans and for people watching this for the first time. The director treats this as the first of the franchise to be made into a film, allowing people who have not seen or heard of X-Men, to be able to get on and enjoy the ride. You seriously don't have to watch any of the predecessors in order to understand the characters and the storyline. What I really liked about the story was the creativity of adding this historical event, making it fictional and adding scenarios that are filled with enthusiasm. The film focused extremely well on the characters, giving them a great amount of depth and characteristics, making these characters really likable. Unlike the last two films of the saga, I didn't have that feeling that most of the characters were there just to be on screen and to brought in for no particular reason. All were added for a purpose and most of these characters play a critical role in the plot. Most of them have incredible abilities and it is quite amazing to see these characters unleash their power. My only complaint about the characters was Beast because of how ridiculous he looked compared to the 3rd entry. Beast in the 3rd film looked like how Beast should look, but Beast in this film looked like an overgrown Beast doll that didn't get the cuddling and love from children.<br/><br/>Another thing that diverse this with the last two entries of the saga was bringing in the excitement and making these scenes count. It was amazing to see these characters use their abilities, fun to watch them train and the final showdown had that action packed excitement that you want in a super-hero flick. You may complain about the final showdown, based on how these characters have these crazy abilities, but didn't receive the justice and showdown that you wanted to see; other than that, the final showdown is great and it will get you quite excited. Personally, the director brought up some pretty awesome, well shot scenes that were pretty awesome. My favorite has to be near the end of the final fight between Magneto and Shaw. Just watching that scene really brought a huge grin because of how awesome it was and is definitely one of the most awesome scenes I have seen in 2011.<br/><br/>The main question that people will wonder is if James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender can pull off being Professor X and Magneto's younger self. The answer is simple: not only did they gave out great performances, but they were extremely great and portrayed as the characters quite perfectly. You see a different side to the characters, something that you didn't get to see in the other films, and the film gave plenty of depth to these characters and both actors just did a tremendous job portraying as both characters. None of them outshine one another, since both gave out equally strong performances, making you like both characters equally. Kevin Bacon was simply great as the villain, Sebastian Shaw. Shaw is definitely one great villain and stand tall with other villains in the saga. What Shaw can do is quite impressive and once you see what he can do, you will be quite amazed and will definitely like him as a villain. Every other cast also did great and fit very well with their characters.<br/><br/>Not only did this brought back the saga to its feet, but it definitely stands equal or actually better than the first 2 entries of the saga. Great characters, exciting moments, great portrayals and perfectly combining the story with the others made this film a worthy comic book film and an exciting film to watch."

I love Hollywood movies because of their creation of villains. Here we see how a normal boy is transformed into a destructor of human kind. His performance is much better than James Mcavoy as both have powers but then the situation demanded a aggressive character.<br/><br/>I was thrilled when Erik says I am Frankenstein monster. The final battle between Erik and Shaw should have been more interesting but let not demise the thrilling moment when the coin passed through his brain, he felt everything.

","I saw this movie a little while back, but I didn't get around reviewing it. But it's better late, than never, so here it is: I think First Class is the best X-Men movie yet. I read in a lot of reviews that it's the ""BEST COMIC MOVIE EVAR!!!1!!1!!one!!!!!!"", but it is not as good as The Dark Knight or Iron Man, although it is a very good film. Despite the fact that there are a few differences in this film to the other X-Men movies, this one was, by far, the best. Matthew Vaughn has never made a bad movie yet, so why'd he make a bad X-Men movie?<br/><br/>Michael Fassbender was the best choice for young Magneto. He did a great job in portraying the soon to be greatest villain of all time (according to the list on IGN). James McAvoy was a good professor X too, but I just wasn't convinced that he was the same old guy we saw in X- Men, X2 and X-Men: The Last Stand. The villain in this film, Sebastian Shaw (played by Kevin Bacon) was also very good, but not as good as Magneto, of course. The other members of the cast were good as well, but I have one aching question: why did the black guy have to die after like ten minutes of screen time?<br/><br/>The story was well written, but there were some plot-holes if we consider the previous films. Matthew Vaughn was a great choice as the director, he did a very good job. Another thing that I have to mention is the music. It was mind-blowingly amazing!<br/><br/>If you like comic book adaptations this movie is a must see. If you don't like them, then it's possible that you'll like this one."

","A lot of people felt that after X2, the franchise was losing steam. X3 was a huge disappointment to some (not to me, it was just a mild disappointment to me). And then the Wolverine movie was good but seemed to be too far apart from the X-Men franchise to be considered part of its ""canon"" with character continuity issues between it and the first X-Men movie.<br/><br/>Well this one definitely has the storyline, the characters, and the actors to help revive this movie franchise. The casting of the characters for Charles Xavier and Erik Lehnsherr was spot on. Both actors did brilliantly in moving along the main stem of the plot - the introduction, budding friendship, and eventually alienation of the two great mutants of their generation.<br/><br/>The effects are very good and yet they don't overwhelm the picture. The picture is still about the humans/mutants, their story lines, and their interactions with each other. It's SciFi with heart and that's the best kind.<br/><br/>X-Men: First Class does have some predictable parts to it, such as when the youngsters who take over the story they're bound to get into trouble. And with all these character introductions with attractive young folk, you're always two scenes away from turning it into a teen-age sex comedy superhero style.<br/><br/>But the directors and writers are able to veer into that territory without crossing the line. I can't wait for the next one. And ultimately, that's the mark of a great film.<br/><br/>9/10"

In the other movies you see Xavier and Magneto on the other side but this is still when the both of them are still working together and shows you what lead them to picking opposite sides of the battle.

From the special effects to the make-up and finally to the actors this film is amazing. Movies like this never win awards, but you will be hard pressed to find better performances than those of James McAvoy, Kevin Bacon, & Michael Fassbender. The whole cast was terrific, the story was fantastic, and the special effects were truly out of this world. This is a great film and I'm craving more.

","After the disappointing X-Men Origins: Wolverine, the X-Men saga has been fully pumped once again with the origins of the friendship of Charles Xavier and Erik Lehnsherr. X-Men: First Class is a very stylish film but still has a brilliant mixture of dark grit and brutality that made X2 such a great success. Michael Fassbender makes a perfect approach to Erik, rocking a turtleneck sweater and a great Irish-German accent. And James McAvoy's Charles is sophisticated when sober and hilariously intelligent when drunk. But the spectacular thing is this- they don't even reflect Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart. This is one film that can stand on it's own two feet and make itself it's own thing. The supporting cast is also quite brilliant. The star of the career-boosting Hunger Games, Jennifer Lawrence, is sexy but also sweet as Mystique; Lucas Till amazes as Havok; and Lenny Kravitz's daughter Zoe shines as a hero and villain as Angel. You must see this film. It doesn't really get any better than this in the X saga!"

Fortunately I wasn't disappointed.<br/><br/>The film is about the first meeting of the mutants and the struggle they face in the world. Sides are chosen and teams are formed. What makes this film work so well is the cast. They portray the characters in the early stages of their lives so well. Charles Xavier/Professor X (James McAvoy) & Eric Lehnsherr/Magneto (Michael Fassbender) are great first as friends and then against each other. But they are not alone. Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) makes a great villain .The rest of the characters are portrayed well and the turmoil each of them face acted out well but the stand out performance for me is Jennifer Lawrence as Raven Darkholm/Mystique. All she wants is to look normal and to be accepted and you see and feel her pain and anguish.<br/><br/>There are a few plot discrepancies if the film is to fit in to the established X-Men of the movies, but most of these can be explained away. However it looks like this could be a complete reboot of the franchise. Either way, the next film should answer this. Hopefully Brian Singer will return to produce it as his versions of the X-Men are far superior to anyone else's efforts.<br/><br/>I was fortunate to know one of the camera men working on this, Martin Hume. He is a veteran camera operator working on films for many years including Aliens, First Knight, The World is Not Enough & The Bourne Ultimatum. He said it was one of the more challenging films he had worked on, but also one of the most visually amazing. What I found out was many of the scenes that I thought would have been CGI were in fact filmed on location. For instance the beach scene climax was filmed on location and not in a studio or green screen. This for me gave me a new perspective on the film and a new respect for the makers of the film.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of comic movies this is one not to miss."

","As a girl I'm not really one for any action movies I prefer a fantasy movie like Narnia or Harry Potter or a period drama set in England like Jane Eyre, but this movie was on cinemax this morning and I happened to catch it at a very action part so it piqued my interest and I continued to watch while trying to figure out who the guy playing a young Charles Xavier . X-men first class was better than I expected because it answered quite a few questions like Magneto's helmet I thought it was for his mutation turned it it wasn't his first and it was to keep Charles from reading his mind. I loved the cerebro sequence where Charles was locating all the mutants, the music was brilliant but that scene was not the only one with brilliant music,the score with Banshee flying was awesome,but the best scene ever was when Erik finally raised the submarine out of the water. The only thing I regret is that I missed the beginning ,and I finally did figure out James Macvoy played Charles. This is a movie for guys and gals it has a bit of romance to keep girls interested and the music does help quite a bit. When the sequel comes out I will find a way to see that"
"The-Sarkologist","6","0","1","29 January 2012"," Good movie, shame about the continuity
","Well, I succeeded in my goal of watching this film in a cinema in Hong Kong, and though the subtitles were annoying, and the air conditioning made this film really uncomfortable (airconditioning in Hong Kong is intense, as much as the heat is outside the cinema), I still enjoyed it, to an extent. It is generally a shame when outside factors make a movie less enjoyable than normal, however, including the fact that attempting to find a cinema in Kowloon (especially when one is not familiar with the city, and this can happen in Australia as well) poses a challenge in itself, I am glad that I did manage to see it in Hong Kong.<br/><br/>First Class continues the latest X-men theme of developing the main character's backstories however there were some inconsistencies in this film that made it disappointing. First Class is set in the 1960's, around the time of the Cuban Missile Crisis, whereas Wolverine is set in the 1980's, around the time of the 3-mile island nuclear disaster. However, in First Class we learn how Professor X become a paraplegic, yet in Wolverine we see him at the end of the film standing without a problem. We solved this problem by suggesting that in Wolverine Professor X was astrally projecting, which is why we see him without his wheelchair.<br/><br/>The second inconsistency is when in first class Magneto and Professor X approach Wolverine who tells them, in no uncertain terms, to go away. Wolverine is sitting in a bar drinking, however this does not happen in Wolverine until after he loses his memory. This is not as much of a problem because Wolverine could have had a drinking problem for quite a while, though Wolverine suggests that during this time he was in the company of Sabertooth.<br/><br/>Some suggest that the producers did not particularly like Wolverine so they have respectfully ignored it, however I quite liked Wolverine (though found the first movie a little dull, and the third movie incredibly lacking). Still, I enjoyed this film and it does make a good addition to the X-men universe, and in this film we learn of the origins of Professor X, Magneto, and Mystique, which now leaves Storm and Phoenix, though I do not believe any are planned.<br/><br/>This film deals with the founding of the school that Professor X sets up for the mutants to escape persecution and deals with how the relationship between Professor X and Magneto broke down. They begin as friends but as the film progresses, and as their attitudes to the role of mutants in the world separates, so does their friendship. The antagonists in the film are the Hellfire Club, who hold the same views as Magneto, but as we quickly learn, Magneto has already been alienated from the club due to his experiences in a Nazi concentration camp.<br/><br/>The film deals with the concept of those who are different, and how we should respond. Professor X believes that those who are more powerful should assist from behind the scenes while Magneto believes they should rule. While such mutants do not exist in the real world, we have seen in societies such as communist Russia where the intelligencia were systematically killed for fear of their superiority to others, but we also have some that do consider themselves superior to others and seek to dominate. However we live in a world without such mutants, and power is generally defined by money. Some use their money for good, others use it to rule. Unfortunately, since the beginning of time, those who use money (or physical strength, or popularity) have tended to come out on top."
"itamarscomix","8","0","1","12 January 2012"," Not a good prequel - an excellent movie
","Why is 'prequel' such a dirty word? Is it all because of George Lucas? Could a good, actual prequel ever be made? The difficulties of making a good prequel are obvious - it's difficult to make the film exciting when the eventual outcome is pretty much known in advance, and the viewer is perfectly aware of which characters are death-proof and which aren't; in addition, being forced to adhere to franchise continuity can come at the expense of good storytelling. Of course, the more fervent the franchise's fanbase is, the most difficult it is. Most franchises avoid the challenge altogether. Batman Begins and Casino Royale were referred to as prequels during production, but both were complete reboots; Star Trek, on the other hand, seemed like a proper prequel at first but then took a completely different route. X-Men: First Class, in contrast, takes a middle route, and it's almost impossible to figure out whether it's a prequel or a reboot. There are too many cross-references to the other X-Men movies thrown around to really call this a reboot; but it also contradicts the timeline and continuity of those movies in every possible way. Are those references only intended as in-jokes? But the approach of the movie is also not different enough to warrant a completely new continuity. That reeks of indecision.<br/><br/>The amazing thing, though, that once I got past that, that's more or less the only real flaw I could find in First Class. In fact, it may be the best film in the series, other than not having the benefit of the excellent performances of Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart. The problems in continuity may make it difficult to enjoy for rabid fans of the previous movies, but as a standalone, First Class stands perfectly well as a sci-fi film with drama, pathos, solid acting, excellent action scenes, and, yes, a sense of humor too - even though it's decisively darker, more pessimistic and more morally ambiguous than all previous X-Men films - that is mainly thanks to Michael Fassbender's incredible performance as Magneto, who manages to equal Ian McKellen's wonderful portrayal of the same character in X-Men 1-3.<br/><br/>X-Men: First Class suffers from the inherent problems of all prequels - anyone who saw the first three X-Men movies or knows anything about the comics knows a lot about the conclusion pretty much from the beginning of the movie. But it manages to go around that problem by not focusing too much on the plot - instead, First Class is a character study, an exploration of morality, and a coming-of-age story - as well as a large-scale action extravaganza, of course, though not excessively so; it's a human drama centered on the relationship between two complex characters, but it also enjoys a wonderful ensemble cast. An excellent movie by any standard, that doesn't adhere strictly to the constrained of a defined continuity, but stands proudly on its own as one of the finest superhero movie ever made."

","i'm not a hardcore marvel buff that nows their s*** when it comes to comic book characters. just a regular fan of fantasy fiction when it comes to this genre. yes there's action, great scores and interesting characters.<br/><br/>but it felt so forced to me throughout, whether it was a supporting cast of actors that had bad reaction time to green screen special effect scenes or having to cram everything ""prequel"" to get defined answers to questions across. i think the main reason why i didn't enjoy this as much was down to it being so damn political. i don't care for all that nonsense, especially when the cgi seemed a little flawed on close up shots.<br/><br/>i know this comes across as mindless ranting but there is a point to my method of madness. the underline themes still make it a great film. our possibility of a similar future, friendships drown over ulterior motives, bloodshed over blood relations. if anything positive can come out of my review it's that i'd like to see how the individual actors careers spark in the next few years through this film.<br/><br/>when you get right down to it - i'm sure it's great for the obsessed comic book geek that has nothing else better to do with life. but i'd rather flick on something with an R rating than this."
"kosmasp","9","0","1","9 January 2012"," Marks the Beginning
","After Matthew Vaughn refused a prior X-Men movie, he finally came and made this one. And it seems like he made the right decision. He had more to say in this, then he would have had in the earlier one. Still even as it is, there are of course a few things to be considered (timeline-wise) and even I could see and smile about a few nods to things/nods to future happenings.<br/><br/>It has be said, that this is a stand-alone and has not that much to do with the other X-Men movies. But since I am not that aware of the comics I can only compare it to the other movies. And this is definitely a very good entry into the series (and ties can still be found, with one particular cameo that was just really funny).<br/><br/>Apart from the coherent story and nice build up (even if you can see where it is going and you probably will), the other thing that makes this movie special, are the actors. Top notch casting with some heavyweight actors put into the mix. Highly recommended, even if you're not that much into comic movies ..."
"ymsyctai","7","0","1","7 January 2012"," Good but not great
","I liked X2, X3 and Wolverine but hated the first Xmen movie so maybe this is the case here. I'm not a Marvel fan boy but that is not why I'm not crazy about this movie. I loved the storyline but wasn't crazy about acting in this movie. The almost emotionless acting makes this movie fall flat before it can be considered epic and that is the problem here. Michael Fassbender looks the part of Magneto but simply isn't badass enough. I mean you see him going around and killing people but he just gives off the impression that a 90 year old lady could kick his ass. He just doesn't play a strong soon to be bad guy and that's the problem. January Jones is hot but her cold acting is very distracting and pulls you out of the movie. James McAvoy plays a prefect soon-to-be professor X and Kevin Bacon does a masterful job in his role but both of these actors shouldn't have to carry the movie. Fact is that Michael Fassbender has a lot of camera time and that works to bring the movie down. Another thing that costs the movie is Kevin Bacon's henchmen. They're are also stone face actors which wouldn't be a problem if they weren't in a lot of the action scenes. Let's hope they replace Michael Fassbender before they release a sequel to this.."
"Kungloa","9","0","1","1 January 2012"," Definitely worth a watch.
","OK, so I've seen X-Men: First Class at least a couple of times now and suffice it to say it definitely holds up to repeat viewings. Let's start with the good.<br/><br/>The casting is great, the two leads Erik Lehnsherr (Fassbender) and Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) have great chemistry between them and these are the most important roles in the movie, so you need strong actors for that.<br/><br/>The entire plot revolves around the dynamic between these two characters and it's the better for it. <br/><br/>Erik Lensherr comes from a troubled (German concentration camp) past which results in this sort of bottled rage which is his source of purpose in his older years.<br/><br/>""My anger outweighs my guilt."" Heresy! How dare I use a quote from a Batman movie!<br/><br/>But honestly, I think the same applies to Magneto with a big difference of course. He is blind to the fact that he is on the road to becoming what he hates the most. This difference in ideology between Erik and Charles is what causes the conflict between them.<br/><br/>Fassbender certainly proves up to the task and I can honestly say I enjoyed his performance as Magneto more than Sir Ian Mckellan's.<br/><br/>Without saying much, James McAvoy as (Professor) Charles Xavier is equally brilliant. He exudes a calmness and gives off the sense of a man wise beyond his years. I enjoyed his performance and it was also fun seeing X's younger years.<br/><br/>The action/special effects are remarkable, which is to be expected from a (Marvel) comic-book movie. And I liked the music too, in particular, Magneto's theme.<br/><br/>If I had one complaint it's the constant hammering of the idea of feeling out of place. I get why they do it, it just gets annoying after a while.<br/><br/>All in all, if you're a fan of comic books (movies), you should make sure to see this.<br/><br/>If you're not, it's still good entertainment.<br/><br/>9 out of 10."
"Likes_Ninjas90","8","0","1","19 December 2011"," First Class is another adaptation of Marvel's popular comic, a prequel to the three part film series but most surprisingly, an intelligent character study
","During the Second World War a boy named Erik and his mother are locked away in a concentration camp. But the boy's telekinetic gift is recognised by German doctor Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon). When Shaw shoots Erik's mother in front of him he unleashes the secret to his power: to energise it through his anger. Meanwhile, in the USA a boy named Charles has the ability to read minds and inside his home he finds Raven, a girl with scaly blue skin, who can morph her appearance to look like other people. Forwarding to the 1960s, Erik (Michael Fassbender) is now determined to find Shaw. Charles (James McAvoy) is a wealthy professor still living with Raven (Jennifer Lawrence). When CIA agent Dr. Moira MacTaggert (Rose Byrne) discovers that Shaw is alive and using his super powers to fuel Cold War tensions, she enlists the help of Charles and Raven to track him down. To combat him more easily they work to find other mutants like Hank McCoy; a scientist with ultra speed and Erik; who has a different approach towards their goal. <br/><br/>First Class is another adaptation of Marvel's popular comic, a prequel to the three part film series but most surprisingly, an intelligent character study. The initial thought of a Wolverine-less X-Men movie sounds dubious but the central relationship between Erick and Charles establishes an intriguing premise for a prequel. This is a revenge story and the gap between two equally gifted but contrasting men provides the film with both conflict and powerful dramatic irony. Both their childhoods have had lasting impacts on their present lives. Charles was born into wealth, away from the war and relies frivolously on his charm, intellect and persuasion. Erik is still traumatised by the death of his mother inside the camps and he uses his obsession to fuel his anger. He lacks the poise and self-control for any stability. Director Matthew Vaughn controls the tone of the subject matter more consistently than he did with Kick-Ass (2010). There's a violent intensity about his craft here, with humour employed sparingly. And for anyone with the faintest knowledge about X-Men, there are some chilling scenes involving Erik's transformation into Magneto, which are utterly gripping.<br/><br/>The core relationship is indicative of a lot of the film's broader concerns. Having Shaw move through different type periods, manipulating military bodies, is not only a clever method of showing his development as a character but also linking evolution with fascism. It provides some variation to the standard 'take over the world' motive. And the film does not have easy answers to all its questions about conformity either. Just as it looks to be heading towards simplistic views of self-image the outcomes of some of the relationships, particularly the one shared between Raven and Hank, are surprising. Even visually there's more skill than the mere grandiose. As expected, the special effects are thrilling and superb. But here they do not so much as inflate scenes but give the action spontaneity because of the boundlessness of the mutant powers. It's refreshing to see action scenes that are not so ploddingly choreographed. There's also a wealthy, charismatic cast that gives us plenty of reason to care too. McAvoy is a charming, sometimes funny lead and Fassbender, is terrific as his steely, brooding contrast. Jennifer Lawrence is dashing in blue paint but also provides softer moments of emotion. And Kevin Bacon, a continually underrated character actor, has a lot of fun as the slimy Dr. Shaw. For anyone uneducated about X-Men, First Class is an absorbing introduction. And best of all, it's showing in glorious 2D only."
"chambersjad","7","0","1","19 December 2011"," Glad I gave it a chance.
","I just watched this movie, quite a while after it's release. A friend who I thought was fairly intelligent told me not to bother. He said it was the worst X-Men film yet. I didn't bother, I didn't watch it. But recently my curiosity got the best of me. This was a really solid prequel-reboot of a series that was on a serious 2 movie skid. I'm glad to see all of the positive reviews. And the naysayers ALL seem to have problems with this movie's ""continuity"" with the rest of the franchise and the comic books in general. It's the same problem that my friend had with it. About halfway thru this fantastic movie it occurred to me... ""that argument doesn't have a freakin leg to stand on."" Hey comic book fanboy... yes, they take liberties with the established characters. You know who else does that with Marvel characters? Every freaking writer working for Marvel comics, that's who. House of M, Age of Apocalypse, The End, Ultimates; these titles sound familiar? Oh right, reboots and alternate versions, most made decades before any of the X-Men movies, and there are about a dozen others just like them. I think re-booting X-Men is the most authentic tribute to the comics made so far in the franchise. If that's the best criticism the naysayers can come up with... this movie didn't have much wrong with it. Now I'm off to punch a friend in the kidneys, not too hard, for making me miss this in theaters."
"ajwin05","10","0","1","17 December 2011"," Second best X-men film
","This summer I had seen X-men First Class and consider it one of the best films this summer. It is also one of the best this year. The cast of stars that varied from rising to veterans was amazing. The best performances were by James Mcavoy, Michael Fassbender, Kevin Bacon, and Jennifer Lawrence. Michael Fassbender brought something different to Magneto than Ian Mckellan did. I now consider Magneto to be a tragic figure. I found it sad when he became evil but I'm glad he killed Sebastian Shaw. The ending scene was amazing. I liked when Magneto broke into Emma's prison cell. His uniform was cool and he had painted Shaw's helmet purple. Matthew Vaughn is now one of my favorite directors and this is his best film yet. Jennifer Lawrence was gorgeous as Mystique and brought more to the role than Rebecca Romaign ever could. In my opinion she was in love with Xavier but he loved her back just as a sister. Emma Frost was a great character but I don't like January Jones anymore but she was hot in the lingerie outfit. I liked when Magneto met with the bank manager and killed the two Nazis in Argentina. This movie deserves all kinds of Oscar awards but will only get nominated for best visual effects. One consolation for this X-men fan is that Fassbender will get nominated at the MTV movie awards for best villain. at the Oscars IT SHOULD BE NOMINATED FOR BEST COSTUME DESIGNS. I liked the x-men uniforms, Magneto's suit at the end and the sexy outfit Emma wore. I'd find it hard to believe that anyone could not like this film. This is a superb superhero epic and is way better than Wolverine and X2. Everyone should see it."
"EUyeshima","7","0","1","14 December 2011"," Before They Were X-Men...a Welcome Focus on Character and an Arresting Turn by Fassbender
","For someone who is not an avid fan of the comic book movie genre, I think this prequel to the ""X-Men"" series is well done and doesn't require as much of a crash course as I was expecting to understand the set-up. That's because director Matthew Vaughn has chosen to focus heavily on character development rather than just elaborate special effects to make this historical 2011 fantasy adventure truly arresting. He and producer Bryan Singer were also smart to gather a first-rate cast of young actors who lend atypical gravity to the proceedings and cumulatively, they provide the narrative throughput necessary to show how the characters evolve into their more familiar older personas. Having only seen the ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" entry, I am no ""X-Men"" follower, so it was helpful to get the back stories for Magneto and Xavier in dramatically economic order.<br/><br/>The story begins chronologically in 1944 when a young German boy named Erik Lensherr watches his parents being hauled off to Auschwitz. In a fit of fear and rage, he bends the metal gate separating him from his family, commanding the attention of scientist Dr. Klaus Schmidt, who is eager to harness young Erik's telekinetic powers. Meanwhile, at a mansion in Westchester County, New York, young telepath Charles Xavier meets homeless young shape-shifter Raven. They bond over their unique powers. Flash forward to 1962, and the grown Erik contemplates his revenge against the man who went on to ruin his life. Schmidt has since changed his name to Sebastian Shaw and heads up a secret society out to take over the world. Xavier and Raven are still together as foster siblings as he earns his doctorate in genetic research at Oxford. Ultimately, Xavier's and Lensherr's destinies become intertwined with the Cuban Missile Crisis, a pivotal opportunity for Shaw to use the full scope of his energy-absorbing mutant powers. Xavier is recruited by CIA agent Moira MacTaggert to help her agency stop Shaw. Xavier brings Lensherr to the CIA's secret ""Division X"" facility where they find and recruit mutants for training to stop Shaw.<br/><br/>The young mutants end up dividing their loyalties, and the nonstop action ultimately culminates into Shaw's Machiavellian attempts to trigger World War III in the midst of the Soviet movement to arm Cuba with nuclear missiles. The military showdown provides the context for the separate fates of Xavier and Lensherr, which obviously leads to the formation of the X-Men as they are known in the original series. While James McAvoy (""Atonement"") is effective as Xavier, even evoking some of Patrick Stewart's erudite manner at times, the film is dominated by Michael Fassbender's (""Inglourious Basterds"") laser-sharp intensity as Xavier. A cast-against-type Kevin Bacon has a field day as Schmidt/Shaw to the point where he approaches self-parody. In a nice twist from her role as the spoiled socialite wife in ""Bridesmaids"", Rose Byrne brings a nice, no-nonsense proto-feminist sense to MacTaggert. The others, including Jennifer Lawrence (""Winter's Bone"") as Raven, acquit themselves nicely in their roles. Even if you are not a fan of the series, the movie works as matinée-level entertainment for the rest of us. The 2011 Blu-Ray contains a hefty number of extras although surprisingly no commentary track. There are twenty minutes of behind-the-scenes clips, fifteen minutes of extended and deleted scenes, an hour-plus making-of documentary, and various interactive features."
"SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain","10","0","1","13 December 2011"," X-Men: First Class (2011)
","Next to The Dark Knight, this may be one of the most perfect superhero movies. Maybe even more so, as The Dark Knight became more of a crime thriller. X-Men: First Class is all kinds of awesome for so many damn reasons you really have to see this movie.<br/><br/>The first great call was bringing Singer back as a producer and giving Vaughn another shot after bailing on X-Men 3. These two men are highly talented. They aren't just churning out another blockbuster for the summer. They have sat down and thought about why these characters are popular and why people can relate to them. This allows for a confident film with a story. Unlike Origins: Wolverine, mutants aren't just thrown at you in an endless catwalk of effects.<br/><br/>The second great call was ignoring all previous continuity, but keeping the same film. This means it is neither a prequel nor a reboot. It's just a telling of a story. Sure, some of the facts don't line up, but when a movie is this good, you just don't care.<br/><br/>Fassbender and McAvoy play Xavier and Magneto. Both are younger incarnations, and as such, Xavier is now a bit of a scoundrel, using his talents to pick up women. This allows for some humour that juxtaposes well with Magento's Nazi slaying antics. <br/><br/>I also really loved how this film had a different way at approaching a team-up movie. Here there is action and danger before the team is assembled. Then once they are assembled, but before training, they are put to the test in a big way. Then they get their training and so forth. Thismeant I was never bored, and despite the running time, it seemed shorter than previous efforts. <br/><br/>Setting the film in the 60's allowed for many great costumes and sets, not always familiar in the comic book genre. It also portrayed the battles of our characters against real life events, making it a treat to relate to it. Every spectrum of the mutant fight is covered and how magnificent it was to see a hero (Magneto) and a villain (Shaw) want the exact same thing, but personal relationships make it an emotional vendetta.<br/><br/>This is a series that must continue. 11 years after X-Men started this comic book boom, the same franchise has brought fresh life into it. It shows comic book movies can be bother fun and serious. With exquisite action, well timed humour (hello cameo), and no gimmicks. The editing lets you see what is going on, and there's no intrusive 3D.<br/><br/>HURRAH for this movie."
"Schnayblay","8","0","1","12 December 2011"," The Best ""X-Men"" Film Yet... Even Though the Timeline is Now Forever Messed
","""X-Men: First Class"" is the origin story of the amazing team of mutants. That's pretty much all you need to know. This film is what superhero films SHOULD ALWAYS be.<br/><br/>Let's start with the characters. James McAvoy plays a much younger, less bald Xavier. He's womanizing, funny as hell, but also very wise and a great leader. It's only becomes a Patrick Stewart like performance when he's guiding the younger X-Men.<br/><br/>Michael Fassbender is the new and, I dare say, IMPROVED Erik Lensherr; the man who would become Magento. His performance is natural, amazing, dark, sensitive and relatable. Being tortured by Nazi's as a boy has taken it's toll on him, as he's spent most of his years hunting the Germans involved at the camp he was at so he can get revenge on a man named Schmit; the Nazi who killed Erik's mother.<br/><br/>Erik's philosophizing about acceptance and human nature's natural resentfulness towards mutants is great. His voice is dark, his tone is proper, and his face emphasizes his emotions. You can't help but agree with him. I mean, honestly, he's not truly a villain (well, not until the other films start), but in this film, he's just honest. You can't blame him for his thinking, which he actually proves to Charles within the film.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence plays Mystique, this film's third main character. She's been in a brother-sister relationship with Xavier since childhood. She's somewhat insecure and scared, but she's also very sensitive and relatable. When she and Erik begin their relationship, Magneto rubs his message onto her and she stops disguising herself as a human and permanently reverts to her blue skin as her public appearance.<br/><br/>Kevin Bacon plays Sebastian Shaw, a.k.a. Schmidt, the Nazi who killed Erik's mother. He's a mutant that can absorb anything to become more powerful. Not too much to say here, but he's a decent villain.<br/><br/>The great thing I think critics are loving about this movie is it revolves around the characters. The writers made them understandable, relatable and lovable. Something most characters in the earlier films failed to do. The performances really drive the film. I don't classify it as a action movie. I think of it as a superhero drama (with action). The action isn't just for entertainment purposes. It adds to the story, and in the middle of it, there's always something else happening that makes it more involved.<br/><br/>Basically, this is no ""Dark Knight"", but it's definitely the best X-Men film yet, and I think it's about to lead the franchise into a new and bold direction, giving it new life. The characters and story matter, and action should be there to move the plot along, not just to waste 2 million dollars for FX shots and a cheap excitement. THATS what superhero films should be. And ""X-Men: First Class"" has definitely hid that nail on the head with the hammer. HARD.<br/><br/>This is a great film. A strong recommendation for anyone, even if you don't like ""X-Men"". And since this is the first in a new planned trilogy, you can expect more greatness. Long live the X-Men."

","""X-Men: First Class"" is perhaps hands down one of the best X-Men films yet. Throughout the franchise and amidst all of the television series based on the famous team, we hear about how Professor Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr were partners and the best of friends. But the only images that we catch pertaining to that subject is when the friendship turned sour (even though they have remained close in a way despite their different views on the human race and mutant kind). That is, until now. Finally we see how it all began, and where the division started. Over-stuffed with action-packed fighting sequences and a few romantic moments, ""X-Men: The First Class"" delivers an outstanding performance to its millions and billions of fans worldwide.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, every good apple has a worm somewhere. The main problem that I find with the film (and perhaps one of the things keeping me from giving it a 9 or a 10 rating) is this; the time period. First of all, the setting of the movie is supposed to be in the mid or late 60s- during World War II. However, Alex Summers wouldn't have been born until the 70s or 80s. The age that he is in the movie would make him only about ten years younger than Xavier, thus placing Cyclops quite close to Professor X's age in present time. To me, it just seems that Marvel didn't have any other characters to add to the team, and randomly chose someone completely out of their lifespan to take up space. Perhaps they thought that no one would notice, but that wasn't a good idea.<br/><br/>My previous comment doesn't sour my attitude towards Marvel. I'm just saying that they could have just invented another teammate to take up space if they needed to (just like they did with the black guy with the fish gills that died). I still love Marvel, and the X-Men is my favorite team. Keep the movies coming!"

","The story begins with the mid of nineteen forties where the heat of second world war was in the end. The people are in the heat of survival from the German Monarchy. The story opens with the prisoner in such a camp who is non other than the young, kid Magnito. The death of his mother forces him to develop more fierce and agony in his mind set. After the years passes by, he meets his good friend Mutant with intelligence, Professor Charles Xevier. The Story also gives a good insight about the Development of Mutants from the child hood of professor and Eric(Magnito).<br/><br/>Coming to the conceptual points, it seems that the director Mathew Vaughn wants to convey the messages of any modifications or changes to any physicality(Proud of being Mutant), other than what nature has provided to us brings harm and not charm. Professor X tries to elevate the people(Non mutants or humans) as they are in the advanced state of the life stack structure. Professor X also tries to convince Magnito that sweet memories are more powerful than agony. Magnito when asks Charles to shoot him, he denies it indicating that Goodness always persists and cannot be changed by agony(Symbolized by Magnito) while the reverse is only possible. When the Humans when starts reverting against the mutants (after the understanding between the USSR and America), its Professor who stops the process of attack and follows ""Ahimsa"" rather than killing the humans. The story begins with young Eric being drowned with agony and ends with he himself being the owner of agony and pain. Magnito also breaks the unity among the mutants in the process of achieving that dominance over others by fierce.<br/><br/>The power of mutants is been overwhelmingly showed in the movie. The camera work and the editing is simply superb!. Satya Meva Jayate-Truth(Goodness) Always Trumps."

","X-Men: First Class serves as a prequel to the X-Men series that has spawned in the past decade. While not a groundbreaking comic book movie it still managed to be a much more laborious effort than the previous installments. The movie does a better job of bringing out enjoyment for both comic book enthusiasts and film lovers.<br/><br/>One of the good things that stood out to me was the excellent chemistry between Professor X and Magneto. It also manages to incorporate some of the historical story of X-men into the movie entertainingly. While the villains feel a bit underdeveloped it provides a sufficient start and fleshes out the important people who they clearly demonstrate who will be the villains in the inevitable sequel. In light of First Class' predecessor movies, First Class provides a few entertaining cameos. It also provides a fairly solid soundtrack. The action scenes are decent, but at times the powers of the X-men could have been more atmospheric to offer a more convincing environment.<br/><br/>Some of the major glaring issues were that the movie seemed to be in a big rush and I am not referring to fast action sequence. The plot seems to get overlooked in certain areas and some key plot points seem to be missing rather lazily, but it still manages to hold up for a decent action movie. Also in the rush character development was executed a bit poorly. The characters seem to jump sides or change their minds almost at whim sometimes. It is a good thing however that the steps forward are greater than the steps back in this latest installment of X-men.<br/><br/>Overall X-Men: First Class is an enjoyable movie, that I believe will appease its' fans. First Class is a step up from previous X-Men movies, but there is still room to improve. Here Vaughn has made a really good X-Men movie. Hopefully the next installment will be a great one. 7.3/10"

","I've have really liked the other X-Men movies, but somehow I never felt as excited as I thought I should feel. But I found this movie incredibly exciting. I love the ingenuity of the back story. I love the cool special effects, especially the way Mystique's scales ripple as she changes and the way Azazel appears and disappears (an effect that is used in some really exciting ways). I love the speed and the wit and the performances.<br/><br/>The movie is not perfect. One character switches sides with absolutely no insight from the script as to why, and I thought that was an unfortunate and lazy choice.

","x men first class is just too awesome, in my opinion its the best x men film.My only problem was there was less action in this movie ,for one thing i loved the fight scene with magneto vs shaw and the other mutants fighting its just i wished they would have have fought more with their powers just like in X2.other than that i thought it was excellent film due to emotional aspect of the film for e.g. when Eric and Charles have to go their own way in what they believe is right like martin Luther and Malcolm x for example.<br/><br/>I would give this film 10/10 due to it having a emotional effect on me and also because of the story line, super powrs and fight scenes. after watching the other x men films i was fan of them but by watching this im now a bigger one.As i said before the fight scenes could have been better but other than that its a good film and probably one of the best ones of 2011."
"david-robin","7","0","1","26 November 2011"," well done, but really shows the limits of a 50 years old storyline
","This film is the fourth movie based on Marvel's comics X-Men, and it is certainly the best episode.<br/><br/>'First Class' is a prequel to the other 3 films, and it feels like a reboot of the storyline to clear the previous shortcomings. The obvious benefit is that this is the first X-men film which is self-contained and can be evaluated like a movie rather than the live adaptation for the comics readers. Unfortunately, this film also illustrates how thin and old the plot of the X-Men is : a basic metaphor of a world divided by the cold war, obsoleted by the complexity of more recent series like the Watchmen.<br/><br/>The cinematography of 'First Class' looks like the typical superhero movie from Hollywood's factory lines. Surprisingly, the special effects are lagging behind, they are jumping to the eyes (the castle 3d model, the missiles, the blues skin and fur effects). The split-screen scene during the X-Men training is one of the strange cinematographic choices which really fall flat, and cut the film in a patchwork of disarticulated pieces. The film introduction is astonishingly good, but the acting is then getting immediately awful, until the end credits. Except Magneto, the characters have no sign of personality, and the 'actor studio' method seems to be unknown to the whole casting.<br/><br/>As a conclusion, this film is one of the fist fine superhero movie ever, but it will only be reminded as a film de genre."

","The most persuasive acting in Bryan Singer's classy revenge on Fox is by JFK, who in his 1962 message to the nation conveys thanks for the triumphant end of the Cuban Missile Crisis while stifling what he certainly must know, that American and Soviet missiles spent a lot of time soaring back and forth while telepathically manipulated by the remarkable powers of mutants. The movie's use of the missile crisis definitely performs the function of founding this prequel in the early 1960s and fulfills the doubt of whether or not reality intersects with the chronicles of superheroes.<br/><br/>Mainly owing to the manner of young-at-heart, Brit-grit oomph director Matthew Vaughn sopped up from his roots in Guy Ritchie's super-slick capers, the movie is state-of-the-art and features a few good performances from a few actors whose abilities could've elevated this overreaching artistic cross-promotion, with plenty of action and racket as it renders the genesis of the X-Men, a troupe of roughly a dozen mutants, hitherto. It opens in a Nazi concentration camp, where young Erik Lehnsherr is made to behold a heartbreaking act of cruelty and discovers he can manipulate metals with his mind, but just when he's enraged. He grows up to be Magneto and is played by Michael Fassbender, the sinewy Irish actor who the rumor mill says will become a big star after this movie. For god's sake. He is already truly first-class. But he only becomes well-known after playing Magneto? Moreover, Raven is played by Jennifer Lawrence, recently nominated for a Best Actress Oscar. Now she's a blue shape-shifter with scales. The cost of prominence. Why is she great in Winter's Bone and yet so boring here? At Oxford, we meet James McAvoy's telepath Charles Xavier as a young man, not yet a paraplegic. He'll ultimately oversee a school to protect and educate mutants, and he dreams they can relieve the world. His nemesis is Kevin Bacon's Sebastian Shaw, Magneto's merciless oppressor in the Nazi camp.<br/><br/>Other mutants are assembled into one fold or the other. Each one has a specialty. There's your shape-shifter, a hurricane-hurler, a screamer, a fire-shooter, a swift acclimatizer, named Darwin, sure enough, etc. That each would cultivate a distinctive capability through concurrent transformation is a toll of the intelligent design of Stan Lee and his Marvel Comics gang. Nevertheless, it must be limiting to just have one stunt. You need to move with a clique to deal with all given aspects of a given situation.<br/><br/>The plot entails efforts by Rose Byrne's CIA agent Moira McTaggert to exploit Xavier to fight Shaw, who poses a menace to world peace. Precisely how the CIA came across the mutants is a bit vague. Certainly the agency exists basically as an expediency for the script, and the basis for Moira, who appears to really like Xavier, and as a telepath, he should know.<br/><br/>In any case, the fate of the good and evil mutants cross with the Missile Crisis, which was not entirely as we generally understand it. The scene where the mutants stand on a beach and telepathically spar by causing both American and Soviet missiles to ferry back and forth in the sky is, well, amusing, I was going to say, but no, I should view this scene more seriously.<br/><br/>X-Men: First Class is fit weekend distraction that will soon be outdone in the collective fan conscious by the next one and the one after that. It's not a great comic book picture, like The Dark Knight, or a bad one, like RED. It's not in 3-D, which is a clemency. The cast all represents their roles credibly, if not very enthusiastically, and the effects worthily handle those rockets switching directions like characters in Scooby-Do being chased through one door and out another. The combat sequences feature people having awful things happen to them in rather unintelligible ways, but they also make an interesting consistency for Raven the boring shape-shifter."

","The word re-boot is thrown around and used far too often nowadays. I rarely see anyone re-boot anything that requires rebooting or does it well. I stand on the idea that X-Men: First Class is NOT a reboot but a different direction and a powerful and amazing one, and one of the best films of 2011 for popcorn eating, cheering out loud cinema. The best of a prequel without ignoring the previous films or the Universe and in fact fitting in some amazing cameos from the original films, sticking to the same timeline and bringing in some great new characters and showing us the history of the best characters. Fortunately they also made some downright outstanding casting choices who completely embody their characters. They also don't spend too much time on the new young cast but instead give us the background on the characters everyone was dying to know more about. It gives them the opportunity to explore the new younger cast in future instalments of the film, hopefully being able to keep this alive past just three films.<br/><br/>In a different world where films that people love were actually considered for Oscars, Michael Fassbender would be considered for an Oscar for his truly brilliant portrayal of Erik Lehnsherr and eventually Magneto. I think he channels everything that Ian McKellen created but then took it to an incredible new level. You will be riveted by him and his performance. James McAvoy is also excellent. I figured he'd be the one to watch in this movie and he is but Fassbender is so incredible that McAvoy does get pushed down just a little. But McAvoy's young and headstrong Charles Xavier is amazing too. The two of them together have a good chemistry and are great together. McAvoy gets to do things with the character Xavier that no one else has been able to do. Kevin Bacon is terrific as the villainous Sebastian Shaw. He might go a little too far with it and overact but when it all boils down Bacon is outstanding. Nicholas Hoult does an amazing job bringing all the emotional complication to the young character of Beast/Hank McCoy. Jennifer Lawrence also gives a great performance as Mystique, and watching her character and the direction they take is truly outstanding. January Jones is a little bland compared to the rest of the strong cast. Jason Flemyng is dark and demented and I hope to see more of him as the villainous Azazel. The rest of the supporting cast are all fantastic and I don't mean to downplay them but they aren't in the forefront of the story and I think they will be saved for a sequel or two.<br/><br/>Matthew Vaughn is fairly new to the spotlight. He sort of rose up to fame in the mainstream with Kick-Ass, and now this should keep him as one of the top directors. The action is non-stop, incredible special effects, some amazing battles that X-Men films are known for but the best thing is all this happens amongst a powerfully strong story, brilliant characters, and even some history thrown in there. This is one action super hero flick that must be seen!! With the absolute plethora of Super Heroes this Summer (2011) it would be hard to stand out but X-Men First Class is indeed just that and the best of all of them the entire year. Check this one out!! 9/10"

","I have watched all of the X Men films that have been made to date. I found them all to be good enjoyable films. However this film, I found to be outstanding! Basic story involves Xavier and Magneto when they were younger. They meet up and recruit other mutants to work with the government and help to prevent war with nuclear missiles. Also another group of mutants led by Sebastian Shaw are trying to start a nuclear war all at the same time.<br/><br/>The story of this film is good and easy to follow for the most part. I like the way it was set in the 60s and they do a good job of making it feel like this film took place before the other films did.<br/><br/>I do have a few minor complaints. For one, this film does kind of have inconsistencies with the other films as far as continuity, but that also happened in Wolverine Origin. Its a good film, but a few things just seemed to not go together with the other films, but thats OK. For example how Xavier is shown able to walk in Wolverine Origin when he was older and how in this film Xavier uses a wheelchair when he still had hair. And the whole Mystique Xavier growing up together thing as well. This is just a problem that will happen with films at times, Star Wars seemed to have this happen as well.<br/><br/>There is some good action, not a lot of great action tho. This is more of a character growth type film, not a constant fighting action flick.<br/><br/>I think Xavier was great in this film. He really acts like a young Xavier would, James MaCavoy did a great job as him. Also I liked Mystique in this film as well. The young mutants were all OK, Beast was really good tho and probably the only new young mutant to stand out for me. Kevin Bacon was great as always as the villain Sebastian Shaw. Great casting choice by putting him in. Oh and January Jones was great as Emma Frost with her.....................acting.<br/><br/>But what made the film for me was Magneto. I don't want to over rate it too much, but I found Michael Fassbenders performance as Magneto to be OUTSTANDING!!!! Better than Heath Ledger as the Joker in my opinion. Magneto is a deep character in this film, you get to see what his childhood was like and see him grow throughout the film. Easily the best Marvel Character ever in a Marvel Film in my opinion. I loved Magneto in this film, he was almost too awesome.<br/><br/>So overall this film has a good story and good acting performances. Magneto made the film for me and was awesome. The best X Men film so far and one of the best Marvel Films too. I recommend it highly."

","As a long-time fan of the comics, a big fan of the first two x-men films, and a fan of kick- ass, I was hoping for better things. I suppose the best place to begin is with the characters... Professor X: the actor was good, but the part was poorly written. I don't recall charles being a geneticist, at least not as the primary focus of his education. Magneto: good enough, except that his abilities seem stronger than they are in the first film (""I don't think I can stop them all."") Mystique: the chubby-cheeked actress playing the part here is a far cry from the slender rebecca romijn, whose performance was much sleeker and more graceful by far. Also, writing her into charles' life seemed like it was just a cheap way to get her into the film. Most of the rest of the cast of characters was poorly chosen and under-developed. I don't remember ever seeing bug girl (angel? Seriously?) Or darwin in the comics. Havok was the one I had the highest hopes for, but they managed to make his power look like a red version of guile's energy blast in street fighter, with funny hula-hoop gyrations thrown in for a laugh... The production in general was sad. The wardrobe looked awful modern for the early sixties. And the blackbird! Oh my god, the blackbird... two years too early, a giant cargo space, and vtol capability? I won't even start on the submarine's reactor... Overall, terribly inconsistent with the previous films, and the comics, and reality in general."

","Best X-men movie ever. Bold statement yes but so, so true I wish they would reboot the series off of this movie. If only the Wolverine movie was at least half way good then I could say I enjoyed all the X-men movies.<br/><br/>The plot is the creation of the X-men and the creation of Magnitos Brotherhood. There are so many side character developments in this movie I can't explain in one review. You have Kevin Bacon who is a mutant he wants to start WW3 between America and Russia, so when both sides are defeated the mutants will rise from the rubble. He for some reason believes that mutants can survive nuclear blast. This fits the original 3 X-men movies for the most part there are some plot holes. The fact in the third movie Magnito and Professor X are recruiting Jean Gray they are still friends and that really doesn't fit with this movie.<br/><br/>The acting is phenomenal and all the characters are likable and you can see why some have real problems and somehow you relate to them. The best character was Magnito (Micheal Fassbender) he is such a bad-ass and you finally get to see why he hates humans with such a passion. The weakest character was the villain Shaw (Kevin Bacon) he had similar motives as the later Magnito would but unlike him he is basically just a power hungry villain with no logical plan.<br/><br/>The music score is phenomenal I adore the soundtrack. None are memorable but they enhance every scene making each scene just that much better.<br/><br/>Overall this is a great film my favorite of all the X-men movies. I give this movie a Buy it is a comic movie for fans and movie goers alike."
"SelenetheHunter","8","0","1","20 October 2011"," good but technical mix ups.
","Biggest goof that I noticed was that Professor X and Magneto would have been together for much longer. Especially since in X-Men 3 The Last Stand, it talks about how Professor X and Magneto were together when they both recruited Jean Grey, and it signaled the at the time current strife between ideas and beliefs between the two men.<br/><br/>Also, as cute as it was to see the small cameo with Wolverine it also wouldn't have been possible since in X Men (the first movie) it talks about how Wolverine had never met Professor X, which isn't the truth since in this movie they did even if it was only for a moment and brief greeting.<br/><br/>Also, I don't seem how Emma Frost would have been involved in this film and working with Magneto but not later in the x -men trilogy. I don't really see a woman like that being a behind the scenes kind of character for the other movies.<br/><br/>Also much more minor when Beast and Mystique were talking about using the cure for their physical appearances, beast removed the syringe and it was a milky white, when mystique removed hers it was a neon green, its supposed to be the same chemicals.<br/><br/>Another point, is that if the government already knew about mutants at such an early stage then it wouldn't have been such big news by the time X men (the movie) came out, and I don't see Professor X being about to have the school without every government knowing about it. Also there would have been tougher controls already in place for those that were only just beginning to be put into place for the X Men movie.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the movie though, its a good action film and it was interesting to see characters for th first time, even if it doesn't correlate with their appearances later in the film. Its a very interesting series of ideas as to why and how things started."

My review below also serves as a rationale for the final grade I decided on <br/><br/>Let me begin by saying that it is important to keep in mind that ""X-Men: First Class"" is after all a comic book turned into a big screen movie. <br/><br/>I went with the intentions of watching a fast paced, sci-fi, fun movie that is one of my most favorite genres. It didn't let me down. So, would giving the movie a ""B-"" be fair just because it didn't have a Perry Mason ending or wasn't packed with intrigue and suspense? I opted to give ""X-Men: First Class"" an ""A"" based on it giving me what I wanted and expected. It put everything right out in front of us and put it all together in the end so we can better understand the series and be totally entertained. <br/><br/>I found the story utterly fascinating and was especially impressed with how smartly it has entwined the real world historical events with the genesis of the ""X-Men"". Then you throw in outstanding visual effects and smart directing - I can't say enough about the build of this movie. The acting was superb too: nothing over the top, but perfect for this film. I have to call out special props to Kevin Bacon. Yet another great role for him, he was perfect for his character (Sebastian Shaw).<br/><br/>The film was a nice package deal for me.

I think the movie shed some light into history. History is a two sided coin. Hatred in World War 2 went both ways. And there's a hidden story in X-man First Class. Are you ready? Magneto actually portraits the little Hitler. There has been hot and contested discussion about some Jew raped his mother that started all his anger in his childhood then avenging when he's in power. That's my perception. Yours may be different. If you saw it, I think you'd agree with my perception. If you haven't, just watch with an open mind."

I don't mean the character, the character was fine, but the actual playing the character didn't seem on the same level of Mystique, Frost, Magneto, Xavier, and the rest of the cast. She must be a producer's daughter or something, because there is no way they auditioned a hundred girls and that's the best they came up with for that role.

","I have to admit that I was a little worried about X-Men First Class; after all it was prequel and a fresh new start to the series. I'm glad to say that I was worried for nothing, because X-Men First Class is easily the best X-Men film to date. X-Men First Class is mainly about how Charles Xavier and Erik Lehnsherr became enemies. This is about how the X-Men first started, now I have to admit I have never read the comics, so I wouldn't the history of X-Men that good.<br/><br/>I'll start off with the acting of X-Men First Class; everyone does a good job with whatever role they have, even if it's only a small brief role. But I have to say the best two actors in this film are James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender. James McAvoy does great as Charles Xavier and in some ways reminds me of a younger version of Patrick Stewart, and even surpasses him as Charles Xavier. James McAvoy stands out in this film; he surpasses his co-stars in every possible way including Michael Fassbender. Now while I did enjoy McAvoy's performance better than Fassbender's I have to admit that Fassbender is the next best actor in the film, he really makes you believe in the character of Erik Lehnsherr, he makes you feel for his character, which is a first in an X-Men film. Fassbender gives a great performance, that's almost as good as McAvoy's.<br/><br/>Now I'm going to talk about the film itself, the plot is quite simple like I said previous it's mainly about Charles and Erik, with the backstory of how the X-Men first started. Now in this movie we have a new enemy that we have not seen before, his name is Sebastian Shaw, and he's played by the great Kevin Bacon. I have to say Kevin Bacon really pulls off this role, in such a great way it was like he was born to play Sebastian. Now onto the character himself, I'm not going to lie, I liked the character of Shaw. I just found him to be such a great character that you actually cared for, yes he's the villain of the film, and I know we supposed to hate him. But I couldn't help but to like his character, maybe that was because of Kevin Bacon's performance as Shaw, who knows. Now Shaw does get help of course from his group, which by the way are called The Hellfire Club. For me everyone else in that group, seemed like the typical villains, yeah sure they were cool but in the long run they were nothing but typical villains whose only purpose, was to assist Shaw. That is my only knock on the film, is that the villains were not given much to work with other then to stand there, and kill for the hell of it. As far as the rest of the story goes, I have to say that they did a great job in showing how the X-Men First started, and showing how Charles and Erik became enemies."

","I thought this was one of the better X-men movies. I think it had the misfortune of being preceded by four movies that were worse, so it was like saying, ""Trust me, I'm an X-Men movie"", and people had tuned out. (It barely broke even, from what I understand.) the plot is that Mutants are just emerging in the early 1960's, and a young Charles Xaiver and Eric Leshnerr must stop a plan by ex-Nazi Sebastian Shaw to start a nuclear war during the Cuban Missile Crisis.<br/><br/>Now, some points. The X-Men did first premiere in 1962, and it includes a lot of the classic characters from that period- Beast, Banshee, Havok. It also includes characters from later incarnations. If you are looking for ANY consistency with the comics, you will be disappointed. You'll probably be disappointed with the fact it doesn't seem to be consistent with the other ""Prequel"" starring Wolverine, but the less said about that the better.<br/><br/>Despite these liberties taken with the actual characters, the thing got closer to the flavor of the comic book series than anything else we've ever seen them do."

","With any Marvel Comics-based material, there's tons of room for error - from cringeworthy ""fan tribute"" to cardboard characters, to contrived plotting, but this movie handles these risks well and delivers a pretty solid story in the meantime.<br/><br/>McAvoy is perfectly brilliant as a young, cocky Charles Xavier, who's charisma makes him a natural for leadership and whose moral compass steers him clear of the traps that power can bring. Fassbender is chilling and exciting at the same time as Erik Tellisch (spelling?) whose horrifying past has grown in him a grim desire for justice and revenge harder than steel.<br/><br/>Then there's Jennifer Lawrence as Raven, a young woman who finally overcomes her crushing self-consciousness to cast away all masks and become something beautifully lethal. And finally, Kevin Bacon, showing his mastery as a worldly psychopath capable of godlike power.<br/><br/>All these roles are well played with plenty of room for fleshing out and development. And they're backed by a solid action script that weaves real Cold War history into itself as seamlessly as genes in a chromosome.<br/><br/>Specifically, I liked Nolan's original 2 movies a little better (I'll pretend the 3rd X-Men movie didn't happen, and that wasn't him anyway), but Vaughn here does do a great job and this film can stand proudly among its peers in Action/Hero movies.<br/><br/>A good movie. Rent it and enjoy."

","Not many people can say with utmost confidence that they are sure a movie is going to be amazing. Well, I know I sure can't. I thought this movie was going to be terrible! Just looking at the trailers with Beast and Mystique getting really close, ug it gave me nightmares. <br/><br/>I remember thinking out of the 2011 Super Hero movies that were coming out, this would be the worst.<br/><br/>Oh how I was wrong. <br/><br/>This movie turned out to be one of my top favorite movies of all time.<br/><br/>Ir is defiantly not based off the comics, in fact, it strays so far from the comics that it could practically be in its own alternate universe. The story was really different, but acceptable. The fact that they tied in Mystique with Professor, Brilliant!<br/><br/>They re-created the opening scene from X-men 1 nearly flawlessly, for a good amount of time I believed that they had taken that scene and simply computer edited it to make it look better.<br/><br/>I was so amazed by this movie, I made an IMDb account just so I could review it!<br/><br/>So why give it a 9 instead of 10? Well, clearly because a 10 would make it perfect, so it gets a close 9.9"

","At first i thought these movie would fail.. because u know in past few years all the movie which has 4 sequel on it equals total failure.. but not this movie.. this movie has successfully captivated the whole new level in the X-Men's movie franchise.. after first 2 X-Men movie which i could say quite good, the third X-Men: The Last Stand it just so-so and flat. so, when i heard they wanna make the 4th sequel of this movie, the first thing that came to my mind: "" well it can be good or can be so-so"" but surprisingly, Director Matthew Vaughn did a great job in this movie. this movie it kind a ""back to their roots"" by simply easy to understand story, but not a cheesy and boring one (because again in this movie we watched the prequel) and most of all the story is very originally from The X-Men's Comic.. so as u could may guess it would make all the X-Men's fans happy.. the standout point in this film is an intense action, the great plot and the good act from all the actors especially Michael ""Magneto Fassbender which can make sir Ian Mckellen losing his magnetic power again.. :)"
"Palidan400","9","0","2","17 September 2011"," First Class - fun, fast-paced, and smart flick
","Solid script, great direction, a strong cast, and a memorable soundtrack, X-Men: First Class joins the series as, for me, the best one.<br/><br/>The film starts out interestingly enough with Erik involved with the Nazis (as you saw from the past X-Men films), and from beginning to end, it's fast-paced and very enjoyable. Slowly as the movie progresses, and you meet more and more of the mutants and characters. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender were excellent in their roles as Charles and Erik, and I think they had a great connection, being complete bosses but at the same time so vulnerable. The rest of the cast followed along with all above-average acting, especially for a summer blockbuster type. You could see in many of the characters how they were, their motives, their feelings, how they were conflicting inside, which really added to the emotion.<br/><br/>Directing was great, with some pretty interesting shots and scenes, though I do agree again that at some points the CGI was a bit overblown (but it was awesome nevertheless). What I like about this X-Men also is that it was smart. Smarter than the others at least. Real-world and comic history aside, the action wasn't all mindless and fit in with an intense plot and scripting (as the Cold War in itself is already intense). The scores on this movie were also well done, and contributed greatly to the scenes.<br/><br/>All of that together made an emotional, fun, and entertaining film. Of course, all of this isn't new to us, the themes of good and evil, the character types, etc. have been seen in so many superhero and other films, but X-Men does it in its own way. So it's not perfect, but whether you're a fan of X-men or not, X-Men: First Class is a very entertaining film that I recommend."
"Batfan1988","7","0","4","16 September 2011"," The 12 Things Wrong With X-Men: First Class
","First of all let me say that X-Men First Class is not a bad X-Men movie...IF it was the first X-Men movie made. If FC had been made back in 2000 (when the first X-Men was released) then this would have set the bar so high for comic book movies that what we have been lucky to see over the last two years and coming up next year would have been what we had back in 2002-2006. Unfortunately, this is the fifth X-Men movie and it is not a reboot, nor is it a stand-alone movie. That is where Fox screwed up. They should have used this opportunity to relaunch the film franchise. I get that they still have Hugh Jackman under contract for at least one more movie as Wolverine, but they could have left him out of this. I only watched this movie for research, but when I finally decided to watch it I left all of my comic book knowledge at the beginning of the movie to give it an objective chance, I even ignored the other movies as much as I could while watching it.<br/><br/>X-Men movie timeline for reference: X-Men First Class takes place in 1962 before, during, and after the Cuban Missile Crisis. X-Men Origins: Wolverine is set sometime between 1969-1978 (estimating off the top of my head) X-Men takes place in the year 2000 or later X-Men 2&3 are a 2-3 years after X-Men<br/><br/>1. Charles Xavier (Professor X) met Raven Darkholme (Mystique) when he was child and they grew up as siblings. This is bull crap because they act like they hate each other and know very little about each other in the other X-Men movies.<br/><br/>2. Emma Frost appears to be between the ages of 20-26. Emma Frost appeared in XMO Wolverine and she looked like she was 17 years old, MAX. XMO Wolverine DEFINITELY takes place after First Class, so she must have aged backwards then and has no idea who Xavier is?<br/><br/>3. Xavier & Magneto try to recruit Wolverine, that's wrong because in the other movies Wolverine has no clue who Xavier or Magneto are and they don't show that they recognize him either. The way Wolverine turns them down in First Class is perfect, you won't forget it so why do they?<br/><br/>4. Cyclops makes a very brief cameo, he looks like he is between 10-12 years old. In XMO Wolverine he appears to be 16-17 at the most. And if you follow the timeline from FC to XM Cyclops should be somewhere between 40-50 years old. That is just what is wrong with the movie, if you compare it to the comics, Havok is Cyclops YOUNGER brother but according to FC Havok is between 17-21.<br/><br/>5. As mentioned above, Havok is too old to fit the continuity of the comics. Let's ignore that like I did while watching this movie...His powers shouldn't be red and his powers should come out of his arms. In all of the other X-Men movies, Havok is not mentioned ONE TIME in dialogue.<br/><br/>6. Beast hardly does anything (which is fine because he is a pacifist), but he turns blue and furry in this movie. In X-Men 1 or 2 he is shown as Hank McCoy and he is human on television. But then he is blue and furry again in X-Men 3? Also, he does not turn blue because of Mystique. Even though they don't say that, if you are an average ignorant movie-goer then you will probably get that from this movie.<br/><br/>7. Storm makes a brief appearance, seeming to be between 11-13, making her 45-55 in the other X-Men movies. (Damn, I didn't know Halle Berry was so old! lol)<br/><br/>8. Cerebro (the machine Xavier uses to find mutants) is created by Xavier and Magneto in the other movies, BUT in First Class the government has already used Beast to create a bare-bones version. Not to mention that Xavier and Magneto part ways at the end of the movie so how does Magneto even help with the upgraded version?<br/><br/>9. Moira MacTaggert did not meet Xavier while she was a government agent (which she never was), they were college sweethearts.<br/><br/>10. Magneto's helmet: In the original X-Men movies, he says HE made it to keep Xavier out. In First Class he takes it from someone after killing him, but that person had the Russians make him the helmet. The final helmet that Magneto wears is bad friggin ass. It is really close to the comic version and I personally love it!<br/><br/>11. Angel: Instead of using a male with angel wings they cast a woman as a stripper with pixie wings and called her Angel.<br/><br/>12. The government finds out about mutants in First Class but in X-Men they have no clue what a mutant is.<br/><br/>As I said, this is probably the best X-Men movie made, if it were the first one in a franchise. I boycotted this move because it came out on my birthday and I only knew about two of these inaccuracies."

"kevinxirau","8","0","2","11 September 2011"," Probably the best X-Men movie ever made.
","There's quite a history to the X-Men, even before the movies came out. From the beginning, the iconic mutant team created by the likes of Stan Lee represented the outcasts and rebels that suffer the persecution of ""normal"" people. As the movie adaptations progressed, the antics go higher and higher, more of the famous mutant characters are introduced, and the popularity of actors such as Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Patrick Steward, etc. increased among fans. For this special prequel, we see literally the old days when Professor X and Magneto were the best of friends.<br/><br/>Now to the plot: It's the 1960s, during the infamous Cold War tension, where a young Charles Xavier and Mystique are recruited by the likes of CIA agent Moira MacTaggert to help stop the evil Hellfire Club from starting WW3 so only mutants can rule the world. The club consists of Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon), Emma Frost, Azazel, Riptide, and later Angel Salvadore. Along the way, Charles encounters and befriends Erik Lensherr a.k.a. Magneto, who seeks revenge on Sebastian for killing his mother back in WW2. With the imminent threat on its way, Charles and Erik gather more mutants to help save the world: Havok, Banshee, Darwin, and Beast. It's time to take a stand.<br/><br/>I didn't expect mush from this film when I first heard about it due to the abundance of X-Men movies out there; I though this one would just blend in with the crowd, but thankfully I was wrong. First Class is just full of cool effects, a nice story, great action scenes, and excellent character development (especially the Charles/Erik friendship and Mystique/Beast romance). There were nice jokes like when the Professor and Magneto actually find Wolverine in a bar to recruit him and he just plain tells them off.<br/><br/>There weren't that many problems with this film, although one noticeable problem was how little Darwin did and how he was killed off fairly early. Such mutant potential was just wasted. The final fight also could have used just be a little longer but that's a minor complaint. I also felt that Magneto became his classic evil self a little too early but that's a minor one too. The biggest complaint I have is the film's biggest blooper: Charles gets paralyzed by a bullet in the end and in the previous X-Men movies you see an older Charles in a few flashbacks clearly walking! Someone didn't pay attention. Not to mention he was friends with Magneto at the time too.<br/><br/>Okay, bottom line, this is still a great movie. They should fix the problems mentioned above in the next movie. They should use Apocalypse in the next movie. That would be awesome! And maybe they can bring in Sinister too. If you want some good old mutant superhero fun, then check this baby out."

","""I always knew I couldn't be the only one who was... different."" After Charles Xavior (McAvoy) meets Raven as a child his life takes on new meaning. When he runs into Erik Lensherr (Fassbender) as an adult he realizes that there is a group that needs to be accepted. The ""X-Men"" are born. Having never been a big fan of the series I was not really looking forward to this movie. After watching it I became a fan. This movie is the expectation to the rule that the more sequels you make the worse they get. This one is the best of all of them. The fact that this movie is set against actual historical events makes this seem like more then another comic book movie. The origins of the ""X-Men"" set against the Cuban Missle Crisis is great for a history buff like me. This is a movie that much like the ""Star Wars"" prequels you don't need to see the others first, but you will understand more and get the call-back jokes. For someone who was not a fan of this to start with I loved it. For those that already are fans you will absolutely love this. For those who have never seen any of these before, this is a good start. Overall, not just a good sequel or comic book movie, but a great movie in general. Highly recommend.

","When I set down in the chair of the cinema, I wasn't gladly waiting for ""x-men: first class"" to start (since I was never a big fan of the x-men series). However, it surprised me by turning out to be a prequel (precedes the original movies). That's when my hopes started to get up.

The story about the x-men aren't really a thing were ""no one knows more than me"", but I still have some memories from the first one or two movies.

"FatMan-QaTFM","Null","0","1","24 August 2011"," A comic movie for the non-comic viewer
","What do you do when Bret Ratner crash lands the last in a great set of films? Well, first you make sure he has nothing to do with any more of them and second you want turn back time and hopefully reset the X-Men clock to before Ratner passed X-Men: The Last Stand onto a film reel. Comics are all about alternate universes – let's enter one where the directors, actors, and storyline are thought out and entertaining.<br/><br/>Just with the folks involved, this movie had a great chance of being at least good. I have thoroughly enjoyed every one of Matthew Vaughn's films from Layer Cake to, most recently, Kick-Ass. Given a bigger budget, I knew he would be capable of more. Two of the writers were also on Thor (uh-oh), but I'm sure Vaughn and Jane Goldman reeled them back to reality. Top off the talent with James McAvoy as Xavier and Michael Fassbender as Magneto. There was a brilliant mix of established talent and new faces. Nobody was a nobody, but I'll bet this is the first time since Mad Men that you recognized January Jones on screen.<br/><br/>So we're back in time with the start of X-Men. Sure they've been around, but they didn't get their catchy nicknames or skin-tight suits until this moment. Speaking of skin-tight suits, it's amazing how every movie tries to justify with a scientific explanation why the female characters need super-cleavage inducing suits. Can't we just gloss over a reason and all get along? I'd rather leave the cool action to the big screen – I really can't describe how nice everything turned out. Great explosions, very nice period settings. We get requisite TV shots of Kennedy saying ""Cuber"" so we all know what year we're in. What I can talk about (since this is a critical critics review) is character development.<br/><br/>If I had any complaint, it would be wanting more character growth. By this point we know a lot about Prof. X and Magneto. Don't twist my words in your angry mind, comic-book reader, I liked seeing that initial relationship and falling out. I also loved seeing Mystique's beginnings (played by the crazy-talented Jennifer Lawrence), but there were so many other characters that seemed to be begging for more back story. Even Sebastian Shaw – obviously a very talented mutant – was assumed to just be the evil guy who needed getting. Little was revealed besides his early ties to Magneto. I know it's hard to have a film under 4 hours long with as many characters that populate a mutant environment, but I was left wanting more. It's really a pitiful complaint against an enjoyable film.<br/><br/>While X-Men: First Class had it's little comic-type jokes, it generally avoided the cheese factor enough to create a world that us non-comic watchers didn't feel lost in the little inside jokes. With a $65 million opening, I'm hoping Vaughn and the rest of the crew return for more retro-styled X-Men adventures very soon."

","Before I walked into this film, I didn't have sky-high expectations, but after I walked out, I realized the X-Men franchise is back on its feet.<br/><br/>Even if it wasn't 100% accurate, I was still able to have fun with the story, the characters, the action, and even, the two surprise cameos.<br/><br/>1. The relationship between Professor X and Magneto was portrayed phenomenally, by being portrayed similarly to the Martin Luther King, Jr/Malcolm X conflict. Both about two men fighting for the same ideal with different points of view 2. The 1960's setting was a perfect setting for some of the mutants 3. Kevin Bacon played a kick-ass villain as Sebastian Shaw.<br/><br/>4. The young, supporting cast did a superb job. But for me, the standout performance was Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique, who undergoes a struggle throughout the film of whether to accept her mutation or be accepted by society 5. January Jones was sexy as hell as the chilly babe Emma Frost, and played the role as sort of a James Bond-type femme fatale.<br/><br/>6. Instead of just the special effects, which were amazing, the story and the character development were the driving force behind the film, which to me, is one of the highest points of the film, aside from the best thing about the film....<br/><br/>7. Michael Fassbender's EPIC portrayal as Magneto. He embodies the character's lust for vengeance, devotion to an ideal, and descent into madness, PERFECTLY. I'd say i haven't seen a more perfectly-realized comic book villain since Heath Ledger as The Joker.<br/><br/>The Bad:<br/><br/>1. How Professor X and Megneto were given their names<br/><br/>2.

"inclusus_review","Null","0","2","17 August 2011"," Enjoyable adaptation that only narrowly misses out on being great
","I was really looking forward to this for a long time and was not disappointed as it turned out tense, immersive, pacy, full of action and generally great fun. I'm really enjoying seeing director Matthew Vaughan grow too and having enjoyed his output so far am intrigued to see where he goes next. Here he manages to direct a well balanced comic book adaptation managing to navigate between the Hollywood, self-knowing, smart-ass movies (Iron Man 2) and the oh-so-serious (Dark Knight). However as an origins piece it does take away valuable time from any deep story lines so while being very good I couldn't quite allow myself to say great. <br/><br/>The cast all put in decent performances with the main players particularly working well together with strong support being a mix of new comers and experience. Kevin Bacon's Sebastian Shaw is a dastardly solid villain while James McAvoy as Charles Xavier has that easy likability (blandness?) he's had since TV's Shameless. However, its Michael Fassbender's Erik/Magneto that stands out here but then I find he's consistently spot on with his performances anyway. (I don't want to say 'this is only a comic book adaptation' but check out Hunger or Fish Tank two wonderful though very different films for an example of his talent.)<br/><br/>Although this is a prequel it does not exist in the same Marvel universe as the other X-Men films. The poor X3 Last Stand showed a bald Xavier walking while in this offering we see him supposedly paralyzed yet with a full head of hair. Although the film strays from certain origins (and endings!) it's nice for the comic crowd to see the Hellfire Club in there and also touches like introducing William Stryker Sr too. These little details I found fun as they gave fans a knowing extra while not sneering at those who didn't get it. <br/><br/>Even though it is quite long for this type of feature I felt comfortable with the pace of the film. The introductions as they start building the team come rapidly but do not seem rushed. Similarly the training section follows a similar quick fire fashion effectively conveying progress and growing friendships in a minimum of screen time.<br/><br/>Relationships form the backbone of the film - not just human/mutant but Erik/Xavier, Xavier/Mystique, Mystique/Erik, Erik/Shaw - and I was impressed the way the film let many intertwining strands play out while keeping the story moving and not focusing too hard on one at the expense of others. <br/><br/>This evenhandedness is really where the film excels as it shares the burden well between the players rather than rely too much one character (thinking of Wolverine). McAvoy and Fassbender draw out a really warm and believable relationship and even though most watching will know their fate the tension is upheld (far better than in say the Star Wars prequels and Vader's turning) and their affinity portrays genuine regret at the routes they must take. <br/><br/>Characterisation is strong for the main although the female parts all have traits seemingly based on classic Hollywood feminine stereotypes Mystique is very needy, Angel terribly insecure and Emma Frost while one of the most powerful mutants is dominated first by Shaw and then literally by Magneto who in a classic male fantasy straps her to a bed and asphyxiates her. Not to say the male characters are above suffering from similar anxieties or complexes - Havoc cannot control himself while Xavier can't stop trying to control everyone - but the mutant world is definitely still a man's world. We could call fault with the original text but I think this could have been avoided without loss of narrative. <br/><br/>The film is a bit heavy-handed with the theme of not fitting in although it was slightly surprising that given the era it didn't touch on the civil rights movement. However it's not quite the simple reflection of diversity and tolerance faced in our society so steering clear may have actually been wise. One thing I did find a tad irritating was the time line. When so much effort was put into other details it just seemed lazy rather than down to artistic license. I'm a moderate fan rather than a fanboy geek but to my knowledge I would have placed Banshee much older than he appears and I'm not sure Havoc would have even been born at this time. I could be wrong and of course this means nothing to those who don't care/know the comics and has no influence on the story other than mild elitist-antagonism for those who may. <br/><br/>After the initial excitement I was also little disappointed that the Sixties setting was really only highlighted by giving the female characters shorter skirts and higher boots. Attitudes of the era may have been signified briefly in the offhand objectification of women at the Hellfire Club but it hardly seems as if Hollywood needs the sixties as an excuse to show lingerie clad women. The Cuban missile crisis was nicely tied in to Shaw's fiendish plan and it's actually here that I thought it was most Sixties-esque as Shaw is very much the early Bond villain complete with sharp suits, private submarine and well stocked bar. The fashion in which he dismisses Emma to get his ice is pure Sixties kitsch. <br/><br/>Although not as stylised as other comic book adaptations the environments were richly constructed, characters believable, story interesting and immersion into the world easy for the viewer. The only time I had a slight reality twinge was in the final 'the real enemy is out there' speech where I suddenly became very aware I was watching an actor in a dorky helmet but I can easily forgive that. Although a bit light in places it remains a superior version and a very enjoyable few hours.<br/><br/>8 out of 10"
"natwardman","Null","0","2","16 August 2011"," X-Men - First Class is seriously First Class
","After watching the first X-Men franchise and being very disappointed with the turn out of the trilogy and Origin: Wolverine, I was happy to hear that they were making a prequel but re-booting it. <br/><br/>The 'bromance' between Xavier and Magneto is believable whilst giving it some humour. To think that certain things didn't add up between this film and the X-Men trilogy is simply ridiculous. They decided to go their own way with it and not follow the previous (unsuccessful) franchise. Following the original comics more and introducing new characters.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is stellar, my favourite would be Banshee for his bravery and comical timing. Jennifer Lawrence does a terrific effort at playing Mystique when she was more fragile. You totally understand why she ends up siding with Magneto because of him telling her that she is beautiful without having to hide who she really is, especially with her age and her emotions that she is dealing with. Nicholas Hault is fantastic at the role of Beast, more so when he is in human form and you get the more gentle *nerdy* side of him which is the only thing I really liked in the previous films that Kelsey Grammar pulled off. <br/><br/>You sympathise with Magneto and his struggles after losing his mother, so when he behaves badly you end up forgiving him somehow and Xavier always knew there was a darker side to Magneto so wasn't to shocked to know that he would go his own way. At the end of the movie when they go their separate ways you understand why and that there isn't a war between Xavier and Magneto, they just have a different opinion on how they should live their lives.<br/><br/>I thought I would be setting myself up for a serious comic film about the end of a friendship but I found myself chuckling along to the dialogue which I was surprised to be happy about. You feel the pain for the characters (even the supporting cast) and you get excited with them for the high points.<br/><br/>The effects were Awesome! The costumes and sets were stunning which just enhanced the film even more.<br/><br/>Really hoping that they completely re-boot the series because there's a lot of fantastic young actors out there who are capable of making X-Men what it really is meant to be. As proved by the young cast in this one.<br/><br/>Top Marks! Congrats to Vaughan for making a compelling visual feast without forgetting the characters, the characters backgrounds or the plot (most films that have heavy action sequences tend to make things very difficult to follow).<br/><br/>Just watched and I'm ready to watch it again, and also I'm quite critical about films so this must be a corker of a film!!"
"mikeymcdo","9","0","2","13 August 2011"," Is it top marks for Xavier's first class?
","Another year another X men film in the summer blockbuster pipeline but is this latest mutant outing worth getting your adamantium claws into after the recent disappointments that was the character cluttered X men Last stand and the unnecessary X men origins Wolverine? X men first class tells the origins of how the x men came to be with Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) recruiting other super powered mutants to find and locate Mutant bad guy Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) who believes that Mutant power is a gift and should be used to wipe out humanity. In Xavier's pursuit to recruit other mutants to join his cause Xavier encounters Erik lehnsherr he has his own personal vendetta for taking down Shaw. The core of the plot focuses on Xavier and Erik's strenuous relationship with their 2 conflicting ideologies clashing throughout the movie however what makes it interesting is the gentlemen like manner their arguments have making this an interesting character dynamic with the hero respecting the Villains decisions and vies versa. This makes the audience somewhat sympathise with Magneto with his suffering at the hands of humanity and Shaw. <br/><br/>Along with the relationship between Xavier and Erik there are a vast amount of side characters which all get their chance to shine with the training montage which shows the audience how these characters grow and the relationship between each other with Hank and Havoc having a ladish and competitive relationship and the blossoming romance between Hank and Raven. These relationships between the vast amounts of characters aren't explored in great detail but it does provide a sense of unification between the X men. X men first class is also embedded into historical context with the cold war offering a backdrop to the civil conflict between the mutants. This heightens the tension with the looming threat of the cold war contributing to the pacing of the film with the Cuban missile crisis leading to the climax of the film and an explosive finale which wraps everything together. Other memorable scenes such as the training montage and recruiting the mutants provided with some interesting camera work and unforgettable words of wisdom from Xavier. The overall the film's strengths would be the struggle the characters go through and how mutants are shunned by society especially the ones with physical indifferences such as Mystique/Raven and Hank/Beast (perhaps echoing the intolerance of homophobia) and how the mutants confront it. It is also interesting to see the youthfulness of Xavier by chatting up ladies this shows a different aspect of the character from the X men trilogy. The relationship between Xavier and Magneto as mentioned before is the films basic core with both these characters having similar and different agendas and creates a moral dilemma for the audience. The pacing is also handled very well with the looming threat of war gradually building up throughout the film in which the X men prepare for. The action scenes in the film are also stellar with the mutant's powers which are cleverly handled in the action scenes. Despite the interesting character dynamics of Xavier and Erik some characters aren't developed as well an example would be the villain Sebastian Shaw despite his lust for power he doesn't have a clear motive apart from to exterminate all the humans this makes his agenda (got to stop using that word) very cliché. It is interesting however that the character of Shaw foreshadows Magneto's own agenda but unlike Shaw, Erik has been a victim of humanities cruelty. Some of the dialogue between characters is also very obvious and isn't needed with scenes like this in need of some tweaking. Another criticism would be the lack of continuity between the other X men films. This comes across as confusing with First class being a Reboot and a prequel. The film is also left open for a sequel which might be a risky move because the film stands better on its own.<br/><br/>Although it's not in 3D X men first class has all the right pickings for a summer blockbuster. Brilliant characters combined with brilliant action gives X men first class full marks from the mutant Ofsted inspection. "

I've seen all the other movies, and this was just a cherry on top of the X-men saga. I loved the characters, I loved the emotion, the honesty, the love, and friendship! This isn't another action packed film, it has a soul! It explained many things, it made me love the characters even more and it made me realize some things I haven't noticed before.... I started watching a movie about heroes, about X-men and I ended up crying, like a little girl (who I basically am, just not That little :)). It's beautiful, which is a weird word to describe a movie like this, but, for me, it is the right one...."

","I really wanted to like the movie, as I very much like the franchise so far, but it just did not do it for me. To me it felt like seeing an heavily edited version of a film, cut from a 6 hour version. Like we were only shown some highlights here and there, before taking us to the final scene with the submarine. I liked what I saw, but I felt like there was a lot missing to make the movie ""complete"", in lack of a better word. It seemed to me that they had the script for a mini series, but had to cut the script to fit a 2 hour movie, so they had to leave out the little things that tied the story together. I could really wish for an extended cut of the movie, clocking 3,5 - 4 hours. That would probably make it more interesting to me."

","A prequel to the X-Men trilogy set mainly during the Cuban Missile Crisis Charles Xavier and Magneto  form the first Brotherhood of Mutants to stop a former Nazi mutant Shaw and his Mutant gang. But Magneto wants to settle a score with Shaw that dates back to WWII.<br/><br/>First class is directed skilfully by Matthew Vaughn with a perfect mix of emotion, humour and comic-book action to the backdrop of semi-real events and the swinging 1960s. The team of writers and Singer deserve credit for the idea and dialogue. Naturally it's a well produced film with amazing locations, makeup, effects and score, but it's the attention to detail especially in the now retro set design and props that gives it a great look and feel.<br/><br/>James McAvoy pre-professor X has all the hallmarks of his older self, but he is more virile, McAvoy brings the character to life effortlessly. Michael Fassbender's ever changing accent aside he's perfect as Erik/Magneto hell bent on revenge, from the opening of this instalment this is very much his story. <br/><br/>In supporting roles are Jennifer Lawrence as a young Mystique, Rose Byrne a CIA agent and Jason Flemyng as Azazel to name a few. Main villain Shaw is played by Kevin Bacon who is both menacing and charismatic. However, it's relatively unknown actress January Jones who steals the show as Emma Frost. There are a few surprise cameos from the previous films cast which all amounts to a wonderful cast ensemble. <br/><br/>Vaughn ensures that the focus is on the characters, their relationships and there abilities rather than the fantastic effects but while their is depth he is careful not to over dramatise or make the proceedings too melodramatic retaining the comic book spirit and serious theme sits in it's own respected world.<br/><br/>First Class is well written, lots of fun much and very enjoyable - arguably more than the previous X-Men outings. That said, it's also a great prequel but can stand on it's own. I'm sure fan boys would like to see Ian McKellen's Magneto versus his younger Fassbender self - the opportunity for sequels are endless. <br/><br/>Recommend first class entertainment."
"Bunuel1976","7","0","2","18 July 2011"," X-MEN: FIRST CLASS (Matthew Vaughn, 2011) ***
","The X-MEN series is surely among the more consistent superhero franchises out there: despite the blot that was X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE (2009), the film-makers went on and gave us the back-story of Professor X, Magneto and, to a lesser extent, Mystique. Having been impressed with all of director Vaughn's previous efforts and particularly the similar KICK-ASS (2010), I was looking forward to this being, at least, miles ahead of WOLVERINE (another apparently solo effort of whom is being prepped for next year!) – which it certainly proved to be.<br/><br/>Since we had already been given glimpses into Magneto's childhood in the very first entry, Vaughn (and producer Bryan Singer, who had directed the original) expands upon it, while also presenting us with the friendship – that would eventually turn into deadly animosity – between the two polar leaders of the future Mutant struggle (Mystique, too, had been 'adopted' by Charles Xavier but eventually changed allegiance to serve his nemesis Magneto). This element here, however, lands the film into problems of logic: of course, you might say that, if one is willing to accept such a fantastic concept to begin with, why bother with the details – but I am sure that, if these had been better thought out, the film would have emerged an even stronger outing. Anyway, here goes: since both Xavier and Mystique are depicted as quite young at this stage, why is it that in the original series, he is seen as a bald and white-haired figure while she can still pass muster as a stunning femme fatale (incidentally, Rebecca Romijn puts in a blink-and-you'll-miss-her cameo when her incarnation here, Jennifer Lawrence, ages to womanhood in the wake of Magneto's mocking of her excessive youth!). In the same breadth, while recruiting mutants, Professor X and Magneto (then still Eric Lehnsherr) happen upon the irascible Logan, Wolverine himself – but, rather than being played by a younger counterpart, Hugh Jackman already essays the part...so, then, why does it take Professor X some 30 years (during which time the former has not aged at all!) to bring him around to his way of thinking?!<br/><br/>Typically, with a film concerning numerous superheroes or, to put it more aptly, gifted persons, some are allowed to shine more than others (in both good and evil camps, mind you); it was a mistake, however, to sideline Mystique's character as just one of the teens, since she had been part of the team from the very start (even before Eric!). Most of the others, in fact, come across as mere show-offs (despite Xavier's diligence in harnessing their individual power) – with Beast's complete transformation evoking uneasy parallels to the TEEN WOLF movies from the 1980s! The real villain here, then, is Kevin Bacon who progresses from Nazi associate to big-time industrialist to Mutant megalomaniac (when he is prevented from unleashing World War III, by making judicious use of stock footage pertaining to the Cuban Missile Crisis of the early 1960s, he decides to turn himself into a one-man thermo-nuclear reactor!). Also, while the presence of CIA agent and nominal heroine Rose Byrne does not really come to bear on the central plot, she eventually proves a pivotal pawn in Xavier's crippling accident – which definitely severs his ties with Eric (then again, Mystique ought to have been more considerate towards her mentor at this particularly difficult moment!).<br/><br/>In the end, the film's success or failure rests squarely on the shoulders of the two leads and, thankfully, both James McAvoy as Xavier and especially Michael Fassbender (incidentally, both he and Bacon are made to speak in a variety of languages throughout!) as Eric deliver the goods. For the record, the film's most awe-inspiring moment/special effect is the one where Magneto 'compels' Bacon's sub out of the sea (in full view of dumb-founded American and Russian battleship personnel!) and brings it to land on a sandy beach – where the ultimate battle (at least of this 'new' first entry) is raged. By the way, it was also nice to see the likes of Michael Ironside, Ray Wise and Rade Sherbedgia in minor roles."
"pontram","6","0","4","17 July 2011"," Exerted but Failed
","Honestly I can't follow the high ratings of this movie. That maybe a generation's problem, as I'm in the mid of my 40s and have other demands of a great movie. However, although I'm an old sack, I liked the last four X-Men movies (including Wolverine) more than First Class.<br/><br/>And this is mostly because I missed most of the actors, first of all Ian McKellen (Magneto), Patrick Stewart (Xavier), and Hugh Jackman (Wolverine). Those three (especially McKellen) carried the X-Men movies with serious acting skills and charisma. <br/><br/>It's a bit like the latest Star Trek. The Universe is the same, but the faces are gone, and despite there are new, well-looking faces and good actors, you don't feel the old mood.<br/><br/>Also, there is something certainly missing with those prequels. While cgi and visual techniques are growing, the basic feeling of the former sequels is not present.<br/><br/>First Class tries really hard to drag you in, but with me (and some others I know) it failed. Mystique was ever a character who had not enough screen time, and here she has, is sexy and beautiful and interesting, but keeps being not more than a nice color blob, like one of James Bond's Babes. Magneto's development is shown in detail, but it didn't convince me. Xavier's development is also shown, and we learn how he worked together with magneto, but with all that action and ba-boom this relationship between the two most powerful mutants keeps being - i don't find another word - uninteresting. The worst part is Emma Frost's, her character is paper-thin like Mystique in X3. <br/><br/>The movie may fulfill all the expectations younger viewers may have, but for me it kept being hollow and a CGI action flick between many, despite its great efforts to convince me of the opposite. After the final battle, however intriguing, I wasn't that intrigued."
"nasa_darwin","8","0","2","17 July 2011"," Splendid. Fabulously structured. Fervent.
","Splendid. Fabulously structured. Fervent. Those I can say about this damn good movie. Unlike the previous version, X-Men(2000) and its sequels, ""X-Men:First Class"" gives you a very neat portray of the story of first generation mutants' class founded by Professor X (Charles Xavier). Perhaps it's because this is a prequel - so that many relations among characters are revealed to the audience. But I think this movie provides much more than that. The depiction of main characters' emotional realms is something that amazes me. Charles Xavier was described here as a wise person, eager to help others and passionate to learn something new. While, Erik a.k.a Magneto, was shown as a problematic person due to his deep vengeance to kill Shaw who killed Erik's mother. Shaw himself is a mutant and he orchestrated a plan to trigger World War III between USA and Russia. Charles and Erik were described very intense here. From brotherhood to rivalry, they shared different vision about their fellow mutants existence. Ever since his appearance in the first scene movie, Erik was easily predicted as someone full of revenge and loneliness. Somehow he feels ostracized from the mainstream human being. But, Charles feels the opposite way. He has a quiet normal live, event his surrounding cannot easily distinguish him as a mutant. Another characters' emotion are also explored, albeit not in the same dosage as the two above. Raven is the third character whose psychological aspect proposed to contribute to the story. She, also, feel a little bit lonely and also insecure about her blue appearance. Then also Hank's (Nicholas Hoult) confidence was raised bit by bit as he make friend with Raven. About the action. There should be no doubt. It's much more superior compared to the previous saga. World War issue, the great rivalry between USA and Russia, battle ships, missiles, and of course each idiosyncratic super power possessed by each mutant, are the significant thrilling spices that color the movie worth to watch. It's kinda like Iron Man, but the different skills shown by all heroes and villains give more exciting feeling."
"Generic_Gooner","8","0","2","17 July 2011"," Early promise, some bizarrely pointless scenes, and unfortunate sense of being rushed... but still worthwhile
","I am a fan of the superhero movie and x-men is the top drawer of such movies in the sense that its jam packed with weird and wonderful powers. This doesn't always help when you are wanting certain characters to have more screen time, but the mere premise of a multitude of powers being used as weapons against one another makes for thrilling action.<br/><br/>But this is a digression from the point of the review, x-men first class. On the whole i think i was disappointed by what was brought to the screen, because i am a huge fan of Matthew Vaughn and expected this prequel to kick start the franchise once more with a newer vision that maybe was less family viewing and more dark in its tone.<br/><br/>Elements really worked, with The back story of magneto certainly providing a darker element, and there wasn't any sense of pulling the punches on deaths to characters. There was at the start a real feel for wanting to flesh out characters and the foundations for the story to come later played out at a good pace. <br/><br/>But then there were things that really let this film down. There were scenes which made me cringe, and without making it a spoiler the WORST of these had to be the way nicknames like magneto and professor X came about. And this was one of several moments where they seemed to be in a hurry, like they had a checklist of 'must haves' in the overall plot which were getting in the way of the bits they were more interested in filming. And this is before i get to the noticeable change in Fassbenders accent towards the back end of the film, where all questions about whether they were pushed to a deadline that forced edits and re shoots to be missed out were answered. <br/><br/>Its frustrating because the potential was and is still there, the actors were excellent for their roles and the effort of building their characters, even on the peripheral ones, was better than previous efforts. But Vaughn needs to be given freedom of time, not be constrained so much that he ends up compromising or lowering the standard to meet these ridiculous deadlines.<br/><br/>The hope for a sequel comes just as much to allow for redemption as it does to build on what was started here."

"suha364","6","0","3","12 July 2011"," Worth the $10 only because of the action packed visual effects!
","Somewhat of a prequel, that included split second cameos, not so hidden conflicting racist and ""love yourself or else"" messages, several montages that helped keep the film under 3 hours, and not so obvious connections to what was already seen in previous movies. The movie presented a great introduction to how the X-Men became X-Men and women. There were some not so likable moments. Like the lukewarm reactions of Zoe Kravitz, or the internal struggle of ""you wanna feel sorry for him but you can't"" Magneto. But there were plenty of likable moments, all encompassed in the action packed visual effects. With all these imperfections you cant help but feel for the mutants, walk out the movie and hope that maybe tomorrow you'll wake up with some weird mutation. You also could walk out knowing more than you wanted to know about the Cuban Missile crises, and the CIA's ""No place for a woman and/ or mutant attitude."""
"mirwais-orbit","8","0","2","11 July 2011"," Back to its form
","It's hard to talk about 'X-Men: First Class' putting aside the previous ones. In my point of view one thing has always been very clear: no matter how Bryan Singer has made of X-Men (2000) and X-2 (2003) two interesting and entertaining movies, he should never have appropriated the characters to create his own story and most of the time never respecting the original stories and the chronology of each one of the characters because now they are trying to repair that in a cyclical chain of mistakes taking classic characters but reinventing their stories once again, denying in one way or another all the development in the comic books in its more than 40 years of existence. Sequels may come, but how they will develop and give space for the forgotten characters - or for those ones that have already been presented out of their original chronology - is a mystery.<br/><br/>Anyway, 'X-Men: First Class' pleases comic books fans when keeping some characters or bringing back few others, but at the same time it can displease them for not being faithful to the original stories. For people who know little about the mutants it makes no difference and analyzing the movie itself it actually delivers what it promises and brings back the atmosphere of the first two installments that were lost in 'X-Men: The Last Stand' (2006).<br/><br/>The story is solid and consistent placing the mutants as pieces of a chess game in the historical period known as 'Cold War', making that period the zero point of the battle between humans X mutants and between mutants X mutants.<br/><br/>The screenplay conducts the facts ina linear way and the movie is directed for the adult ones more than for the youth, although the young ones will also have great fun with the characters and action scenes that are frequent from the beginning to the end. It's a violent movie, but not explicit, and this is what characterizes it not only as an adult movie, but an intelligent one as well because most of the violence happens more in our imagination than in images. Michael Vaughn sustained the direction more than the expected using the prime elements from the first two movies but also adding his personal characteristics to it, bringing something fresh to the series, something that hasn't happened in the third installment.<br/><br/>The costumes and the art designs are amazing when trying to reproduce the 60's. Some anachronisms exist but will not mess with the experience. Fans will be dazzled by some references and some special appearances. Bringing Michael Fassbender, Kevin Bacon, Rose Byrne and Jennifer Lawrence to the group just added more qualities and the adult tone to the story. Sometimes I felt that the background music was kinda invasive, but forgettable withing so many qualities.<br/><br/>For me the movie loses some of its interests when reaching the end, easing the rebellion of some characters and making the split between Magneto and Xavier something a lot peaceful for those ones who expected a genuine clash of ideologies.<br/><br/>But in general, it is by far the best comic book adaptation of 2011 and fair enough placed between the best comic book adaptations together to the first two installments. As I said above, it is X-Men returning to its form in movies."
"mcgriff1290","Null","0","1","11 July 2011"," X-Men is heading in the right direction
","After viewing this movie in theaters I have to say this may be the greatest, underrated film of the summer. This movie goes way beyond the title of a comic book movie to something of The Dark Knight's caliber. This movie hits on every level of realism you can grasp from it being incased in a fiction genre .First Class gave the audience an better outlook on the characters that call themselves X-men and the movie made back in 2000 should have taken this route instead of the road it traveled on. It didn't just throw the viewer into a movie hoping we already knew everything about these characters like X-men 1 did. It gave us a background look and understanding of these people and how they became who they were meant to be. I give this film a very high four stars and it deserves every star it receives. 1 star goes to the screen writers and the people behind crafting the script for the actors. The screen writers created a perfect blend of humor and tone setting that has not been present in the first three X-men movies. The humor is placed in right time to propel a dry moment that could have occurred or to foreshadow character relation development. The screen writers also do a great job of setting a tone that flows smoothly throughout the film. It creates a mixture of action and character building that never goes flat. This films tone is darker than its predecessors, but works quite well with the task at hand in making us understand the characters in the movie. 2 stars for the director attacking this film in the correct way and bringing this franchise up to spend with other strong comic book movies. The series before this film had a lack of understanding in my opinion. It focused too much one character (wolverine) than the team in a whole and who they really were as people. You never felt the realism or group connection between the cast. They seem to just read their lines with no emotion, but Matthew Vaughn corrected that mistake and gave birth to this masterpiece. He does a great job of bring the best out the cast and bring the most practicality out of something that is so science fiction. His future in the film industry has been set by making such a superb movie. 3 stars for the cast doing the best job I have seen in movie created in such a short time span. They bring so much emotion out of the character that they are portraying, that the audience can feel gravity of lines they are reading. Michael Fassbender and James McAvoy had such a strong connection in this film that in had seem like they have known each other for years. They out shined the other cast with their powerful connection. There was such passion when they spoke their lines that it just grabbed the audience into the movie. It was such seriousness to every word mutter out their mouth. It was so commanding and gave me as a viewer a better understanding of these two human beings and why they believed what they believe. Kevin Bacon also played a great villain that was on par with more well-known comic book villains throughout the years. He has such a sway with the way he acts on camera that it's hard not to notice his strong performance. This may be one of his greatest performances I have seen in his film career. This is a great blended cast. 4 stars on the action that never seems to slow down from the opening scene of the film to when the end of the movie. For a movie that didn't have long to shoot, they pushed out the most action I have seen in a movie since Spiderman 2. This broke open the box on what a film can accomplish in such short time. Some of the action scene seemed to drive PG-13 to its limit and felt more rated R at times.Also some credit to it have the feeling of a 60's film which is exactly what the film makers were going for. They did the best job I have seen of creating the tone of a certain period in time, making the audience believe we were thrown in the 60's with they whole make up of the film. If Matthew Vaughn can create this movie in a short amount of time and a small budget, it makes someone think what he could do with more money and more time. This movie has taken X-men franchise in the right direction and is under great leadership."
"drqshadow-reviews","8","0","2","11 July 2011"," To Refresh the Present, Enliven the Past
","A truly inspired vision for a franchise that was sorely in need of some fresh air, First Class does so much so well that it can be easy to overlook its shortcomings until it's too late. As an added dimension to the relationship between Xavier and Magnus, it's brilliant - multi-layered and revealing. Nearly every word shared by the two in this picture works to enhance their antagonistic rapport in the Stewart-McKellen films, improving upon an already-solid backbone. This chapter is also surprisingly even-handed and honest, presenting a scenario where neither man is truly in the right nor the wrong. It's that tantalizing balance that's the key to the characters' relationship in the comics, and it's never been presented more efficiently. The Cold War motif that surrounds the two serves initially as an ideal backdrop to their budding kinship, but eventually proves too ambitious for its own good. By the time the big climax rolls around, the story has basically painted itself into a corner and the conclusion, as a result, feels hurried and insubstantial. Forgiving the sub-par finale, it's a nice return to form for the franchise that only occasionally gets caught up in winks and nods at the audience."
"IllusionOfLife","8","0","2","9 July 2011"," Come for the Charles and Erik Story, Stay for not Much Else.
","I have some mixed feelings about X-Men: First Class. Going into it I had heard a lot of great things, comments ranging from it being by far the best X-Men film to being on par with The Dark Knight. In the end, though, I found it to be kind of a mixed bag. As a character study between Charles Xavier and Erik Lehnsherr it's brilliant. While they never quite match the iconic performances of Sir Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen, James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender do a wonderful job portraying these characters and really sell the friendship between them. This movie, on its own, establishes a stronger friendship and more poignant separation of two friends than all three Star Wars prequels did. The scenes between Charles and Erik are where this movie truly shines. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, the rest of the film is a bit weak and forgettable. None of the other characters were particularly strong or memorable (with perhaps the exception of Mystique) and the whole plot tied into the Cuban Missile Crisis felt contrived. I also never once bought Kevin Bacon as the villain. I was also somewhat annoyed by the ham-fistedness of the Mutants=Gay subtext. Yes, I understand that that has always been an element of the series, but it has always been inferred using broad strokes and could be applied to any number of minority issues from racism, sexism, homophobia, etc. Using buzzword phrases like ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" and ""Mutant Pride"" felt very forced, and the signposting lacked the class of the original Brian Singer films. <br/><br/>So was this film the best of the X-Men series? No, that honor belongs to X2: X-Men United. Is it the best Marvel Comics film? Nope, that'd be Spider-Man 2. How about a film on the caliber of The Dark Knight? Not even close. However, it was a good movie, and the excellent character study between Charles and Erik is worth the price of admission alone. <br/><br/>B"

","Now, I am writing this review as a person who is not overly fan over superheroes in general and not a fan of the x-men movies as per se. Sure the first four x-men movies were entertain, even for a casual non-fan as myself, but this ""X-Men: First Class"" was a step up from the previous movies.<br/><br/>Not being super familiar with the story and origins of the characters portrayed in ""X-Men: First Class"", then I am not sure how accurate the movie is to the comic books. But for someone who have read only a handful of the comics, then this movie proved to be rather interesting and exciting. And I do believe that you were given a fair and meaningful enough background story as to whom these mutants are and what drives them.<br/><br/>The effects in the movie were quite cool and nice to look at. And the movie is carried by a good solid story and lots of action. Plus you have a bunch of character building going on as well, so this really worked well for the movie. But of course a movie is nothing without a good ensemble of cast. And they had managed to put together quite a good selection of people for ""X-Men: First Class"". Kevin Bacon really did a good job in portraying Sebastian Shaw, the villain of the movie. But he was not alone to carry the movie, actually I think that James McAvoy (playing Charles Xavier), Michael Fassbender (playing Magneto), Nicholas Hoult (playing Beast) and Jason Flemyng (playing Azazel) also helped the movie along quite nicely.<br/><br/>""X-Men: First Class"" is, in my opinion, a good supplement to the X-Men movies series. And it is filled with action from start till end. And for a non-fan of X-Men, the movie provides good entertainment and also provides you with lots of background story for the X-Men universe. Which, in my case, really made me want to sit down and watch the previous X-Men movies again, just for the sheer fun of it.<br/><br/>One thing did puzzle me though, the advanced level of technology that was available in the 1960s. Come on. It was a bit too much. That was the only thing about the movie the was a downer.<br/><br/>Thumbs up, way up, for ""X-Men: First Class""."
"aaropender","8","0","2","8 July 2011"," Best X-Men Movie I've Seen
","This is a great movie. In the world of comic book movies, I see it as somewhere in the vicinity of ""Batman Begins"", but not as good as ""The Dark Knight"".<br/><br/>In a context broader than comic book movies, though, it remains a great movie. Nothing is forced or artificial. Just about everything that is present in the movie has a place there. There is not an unnecessary romance element. There are no unnecessary explosions, punches or kicks, or laser beams.<br/><br/>There is only a minor detail of the story that I didn't quite understand (though I could likely peruse the Internet to find some form of explanation). It involved the interaction of two characters' powers (if the notion that characters of this movie have powers is a spoiler for you, ... you're probably not reading this review). I suppose my lack of understanding points to almost the only weakness I could find - vagueness regarding the nature of one of the characters' powers. I never understood exactly what that character DID. Really, this turns out to be relatively minor - but it's probably good that I'm honest about the movie's weakness.<br/><br/>There are a lot of really good reviews of this movie out there right now; and, for greater discussion about what the movie is good at, I have to recommend reading those - I just wanted to add a few words of my own. As many others have stated: great directing and very good acting (STELLAR acting from the three primary roles) form a terrific movie - 8 of 10 in my book. Very few movies would I rate higher than this one, and I don't imagine myself ever rating a movie with a 'perfect' '10' rating - I don't generally find human creations to be 'as good as they could imaginably be'. There's always room for improvement; but at 8 of 10, this movie has small space in that area. The only elements I see which could have been substantially better (to perhaps warrant a 9 of 10 rating) are the uncertainty of one of the characters' powers mentioned above, the acting in many of the smaller roles, and the presence of the way many of the smaller roles were written and directed. That is, I think that a lot of the smaller roles could have been presented in ways that made the movie as a whole a better movie - generally with a greater presence for these smaller characters. They seem, at times, to be more paintings on a backdrop than full characters. Unfortunate.<br/><br/>The three primary roles are what this movie is all about, and each of those roles (and the exchanges between those roles) is just about spot-on. I think this is the first movie in which I enjoyed Kevin Bacon's screen presence. I'm looking forward to a follow-up of this X-Men prequel/reboot, with the same team of producers, director, cast, and crew. I hope it happens, but I don't know if it will. It is much better than any of the earlier X-Men movies or the movie of Wolverine prior to X-Men. The franchise would be done justice if it used this movie as a foundation and continued from here.<br/><br/>On the whole, this Hollywood skeptic recommends this movie at a theater price, and in a theater setting."
"Rockwell_Cronenberg","6","0","2","8 July 2011"," Fassbender and McAvoy create fireworks.
","The X-Men have always been among my favorite comic heroes, as their story has always had a more intelligent and political scope compared to most others. Whether it was McCarthyism, issues of race or homosexuality, their battle for acceptance in a world where the unknown is shunned has always been a fantastic metaphor that has followed American culture through decades. This stays just as true here, with the neverending debate between Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr getting it's beginning at the Cuban Missile Crisis. Initially I was worried that putting this superhero story into the historical context was going to come off awkward, but Matthew Vaughn hit the perfect tone for these characters to be implanted, mixing a '60s Bond style with that dense mutant struggle. The driving narrative is a little thin, but the sparks that fly between Michael Fassbender and James McAvoy are more than enough to place the film in the top tier of comic book adaptations.<br/><br/>In casting the film, they really made the perfect choices with Fassbender and McAvoy. The former perfectly captures all of the tortured history and desperate need for vengeance of the man that would become Magneto and the latter makes an expert transition from a charismatic boy into an intelligent adult who finally has a real purpose. The film is undoubtedly at it's best when these two superb talents are sharing the screen, battling the contrasting ideas of each man; Lehnsherr's war for dominance placed against Xavier's plea for understanding. That struggle has always been the heart of the X-Men story and here they finally bring it to the forefront, something that was missing from the other films in the franchise. And they could not have picked better actors than these two to tackle that lofty mission. The other actors do relatively fine jobs, no one else really standing out and the only dent in the cast being Jennifer Lawrence, who felt very awkward and self-aware throughout. I'll also never miss an opportunity to praise the beautiful Rose Byrne and I admittedly got a grand kick out of seeing her in lingerie early in the story. In a film loaded with the breathtaking eye candy that is Fassbender and McAvoy (who are both ""woa man"" sexy here), Byrne definitely stole my eye for part of it as well.<br/><br/>As I said earlier, the one big flaw with the film is that the driving narrative is kind of thin. Everything with Magneto and Xavier is superb, I could watch an entire film of them having a chess match and the action is honestly some of the best I've seen in a comic book film; every scene with Lehnsherr being an absolute badass had me on the edge of my seat. However I feel like they dropped the ball on the Hellfire aspect of the plot, everything with Sebastian Shaw felt very typical of a film in this genre and nothing new was really done on that side of things. The placement of the story in the historical context was interesting and unique at first but by the end it was just another setting for a typical villain story. My one other complaint would be a complaint I have with pretty much all superhero stories that are adapted to the screen. In creating something like this they create it for franchise purposes and thus it never feels like there are any real stakes to anything going on. You know how it's all going to end before you even start the film. However this is one of the rare cases where my concern with that doesn't infringe on my ability to enjoy the story the way it is. Because for a nice change the film isn't about the action; the action is superb but it's about much more than that. It's a film about the struggle for those who are different and the intellectual debate between Lehnsherr and Xavier, and Fassbender and McAvoy absolutely deliver on all of the promises of that."

","I'm glad to see that the X-Men series has rebounded after the very disappointing ""X-Men Origins - Wolverine"" movie.<br/><br/>""X-Men - First Class"" benefits by a much better script and the brilliant pairing of James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender as the younger Professor X and Magneto. The film is carried by the two actor's excellent chemistry and personally I don't think they could have cast better performers for both parts.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence and Nicholas Hoult stood out as well and bring good depth to their characters Mystique and Beast.<br/><br/>However there are notable flaws from my view that have to be mentioned - Though I like Rose Byrne as Moira - I'm disappointed in the other X-Men they chose to include in this entry and how they portrayed them - Angel Salvadore a girl who is essentially an over-sized tinker bell - please! I kept waiting for her to whip out her magic wand and pixie dust - Havok and Banshee - poor but tolerable - but what about the character Darwin - boring - and not only that, he just shows up and then they kill him off - why have him in the movie in the first place? - and Azazel and Riptide - come on - when you have so many other better characters from the X-Men roster to choose from? I'm no X-Men historian but wasn't Iceman one of the original founding members?<br/><br/>Kevin Bacon was OK as the villain and the character Emma Frost seemed a bit wasted and fades quickly from the plot but a good solid story and certainly the makings of a good series - overall - well done."

","X-Men First Class is an epic adventure revealing the origins of the X-Men Saga. It is set in the 1960s at the beginning of the Space Age and at the height of the Cold War. Russia and the U.S.A are on the brink of a nuclear war, endangering the whole world.<br/><br/>Before they took the names of Professor X and Magneto, Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and Erik Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender) were two youthful mutant men just discovering their powers. They search for other mutants, like themselves, to recruit so they can band together and stop a very great threat to the world.<br/><br/>X-Men First Class answers a lot of questions that have interested many fans since X-Men came out, such as: how did Charles get put in a Wheelchair, how they got their names Magneto and Professor X, and how the X-Men got together in the first place.<br/><br/>The acting in this character driven movie is great and was cast really well, especially Kevin Bacon as the evil Sabastian Shaw and Jennifer Lawrence as Raven/Mystique. There are a lot of psychological parts during the movie, and it's not just comic book action. You really can get the emotional depth. This movie had messages in it. Mystique in this movie started out not liking herself at all, trying to cover up who she was, she was ashamed of who she was. By the end, though, Mystique learns to except herself and before she leaves says, ""Mutant, and proud!"" This means that you should accept yourself and be who you want to be.<br/><br/>The action scenes in this movie were very well set up and suspenseful, you couldn't have the movie or the storyline without it. This movie was pretty violent, has a lot of fighting, and some traumatic scenes (like when the Nazi Schmit shoots Erik's mom right in front of him.) It also has a little explicit language and a couple of sexy scenes. Rated PG-13, I would not recommend it for kids under the age of 13.<br/><br/>Over all, I think this movie was the best one yet in the X-Men Saga.<br/><br/>Reviewed by Jonah Menegaz, age 13, KIDS FIRST!

","We see a general trend that all sequels or prequels keeps going down in quality as their number increases. But, a very few come out with flying colors such as this one. Considering the fact that, 4 X-Men movies have been made before it this was a gem. It had a good story, great character development, some old characters to relate to, good visual effects and a nice ending. And yes, it also answered some questions which fans had in the other films like the story behind the friendship between Prof. X and Magneto. Some people might complain about some continuity errors with the next films (as the character Emma Frost). But, those can be ignored to enjoy the movie to the fullest."

Although I guess, mindless uncensored description of killing is what the director is known for. <br/><br/>A well revived franchise, X-Men: First Class is a must watch for comic book fans and movie goers alike. I'm glad they didn't release this movie in 3D, which is becoming a trend with every other movie nowadays, whether it is necessary or not."
"RichardKleiner","9","0","2","6 July 2011"," They're doing it right again!
","Needless to say that it was quite a relief, after so many disappointments with superheros, that the X-Men are back to their full glory.<br/><br/>The original X-Men was great, the sequel was just as good, and The Last Stand wasn't as bad as everybody keeps saying, alas, it didn't live up to its predecessors. Wolverine, on the other hand, threw out all of the artistic merit behind the films and went for the ""look at me, I'm awesome"" style, which almost killed the X-Men series' credibility.<br/><br/>First Class returns to the socio-political aspects of the original X-Men comics, but in the form of a prequel. Therefore, you get to know the Charles Xavier and Erik Lensher when they were young and how they became the Professor and Magneto, and their respective followings.<br/><br/>As a prequel, it's very loose in its connection to the previous movies. While the basics are still the same, if you nitpick, you'll notice some inaccuracies with the facts, but if you hated The Last Stand and Wolverine, then it won't be a real problem.<br/><br/>As some have said, the mutants starring in this movie aren't the coolest ones, but that actually helps the movie be more serious and not just wowing the audience with special effects, although they do accomplish that very well.<br/><br/>McAvoy and Fassbender as Xavier and Magneto, respectively, are terrific. Most particularly Magneto, in a performance that would make Sir Ian McKellen proud. McAvoy's Professor X isn't as striking as Patrick Stewart's, then again, Stewart didn't really make me believe he was Professor X, but simply Patrick Stewart being Patrick Stewart.<br/><br/>It is interesting how the characters are written. Xavier is a player, hitting on chicks and getting drunk, while he slowly (though not too subtly) changes into a wise mentor as the situation grows worse. Magneto still is antisocial and resentful, but he has lighter moments, showing a sense of humor and also genuine loyalty to his friends.<br/><br/>It was an interesting surprise to see Kevin Bacon here, but his villain is good, his powers are awesome and his performance excels. The rest of the characters, in all honesty, are rather generic, with the exception, naturally, of Raven and Hank (Mystique and Beast), who have an interesting subplot but, as we all know, doesn't really matter.<br/><br/>The story as a whole is fun and very entertaining. While they do take liberties with what happened on the Cuban missile crisis, going on the Watchmen route, the tension and the suspense is handled well, even though you wouldn't have a clue of what's going around the world.<br/><br/>The costumes are excellently designed. I'll have to say that, even though McKellen's Magneto was OK, I never really saw him the way I remembered Magneto in the TV show and comics. At the end, when you see Fassbender in costume and his emblematic helmet, you finally say ""Yes! That's Magneto!""<br/><br/>I don't know if Bryan Singer's involvement as one of the producers helped the movie, but something was different here, and it was done great. Matthew Vaughn's effort paid off.<br/><br/>At first, I thought the movie would be as pretentious as Wolverine, but when I saw it, I felt it was genuine and done seriously, just like the first movies. If you yearned for the past glory of the X-Men or if you ever wanted to explore the history behind them, this is definitely a must. Continuity is faint, but you really won't care for it."

","Kick-starting a solid month of motion pictures, Matthew Vaughn's X-Men prequel is everything the trilogy closing The Last Stand and spin-off Wolverine should've been: intelligent, dramatic and fun. Utilising the epochal Cuban Missile Crisis as a backdrop for the young mutants to meet is a clever means of setting time and place, as well as providing a sense of urgency, both for plot and character development. Director Vaughn (Kick-Ass) spices up the proceedings with his rapidly-increasing trademark edginess – have you heard the F-bomb in the franchise before? – whilst the stellar cast features career best turns from James McAvoy as the idealistic womaniser Xavier 'Professor X' Charles, Michael Fassbender as the internally conflicted Erik 'Magneto' Lehnsherr, and Kevin Bacon as the charismatically vicious villain Sebastian Shaw. First Class builds on the success of Bryan Singer's initial two X-Men pictures, rather than relying on it, marking it as a welcome return to form for the mutant series."
"seaview1","8","0","2","2 July 2011"," X MEN: FIRST CLASS Is a Grand Beginning
","The super hero genre in movies has been loading up with adaptations from DC and Marvel Comics primarily from the glorious Silver Age of Comics. In most cases, these incarnations have taken on a stunning visual realism with state of the art technology and pyrotechnics, but what separates the cream of the crop like Spiderman 2 and The Dark Knight from the rest is great acting and a superior script. Having scored less than impressive results with X Men: Wolverine and Last Stand, the reboot of the franchise, X Men: First Class, is a prequel that reinvigorates with a fresh cast, elaborate script (Ashley Miller and Jack Stentz) and solid direction by Matthew Vaughn (Kick Ass) who has proved himself in this genre.<br/><br/>During World War II, a young boy, Erik, is separated from his parents by ruthless Nazis and tormented by a sadistic doctor, Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon), who forces Erik to unleash his power of magnetism over metal. Meanwhile in a mansion in New York, a young, telepathic Charles Xavier befriends a fellow mutant named Raven who can morph into any person. Years later in 1962, an adult Erik (Michael Fassbinder) searches the world for Sebastian to exact revenge even as Charles is thriving at Oxford University. In Las Vegas, CIA agent Moira McTaggert (Rose Byrne) infiltrates a strip club and spies Sebastian Shaw planning to engineer a Cold War conflict with the Russians. Sebastian is aided by a roster of evil mutants including Emma Frost (January Jones). Moira and the CIA seek the help of Xavier who realizes that there are other mutants in the world, and he must seek them out. As Erik closes on Sebastian, he comes in contact with Charles, now realizing he, too is not alone as a mutant, and joins forces with Charles' growing roster of young mutants including an increasingly restless Raven AKA Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence). Each discovered mutant has a distinctive power and a unique name or moniker (Charles becomes Professor X and Erik is Magneto). After a deadly attack by Sebastian and his mutants at a CIA compound, Charles and an ever vengeful Erik set about to train their raw recruits to face Sebastian as he steers the Russians on a collision course with the Americans in Cuba. With a global war imminent, Sebastian reveals a deeper, more insidious plan that could mean the end of humanity. The action filled climax is a visual feast that has a stunning display of military might versus the mutant super powers and sets the stage for betrayal and realigning allegiances.<br/><br/>This is a handsomely mounted production, with visual effects that serve the story and its super mutants in ways that could not be convincingly rendered a generation before. When a young Erik displays destructive power in front of his Nazi captors, it hearkens back to Drew Barrymore's burning apocalypse in Firestarter. Lending realism to otherwise unworldly characters, the dialogue frequently switches to German, Russian, French and Spanish as the setting dictates, and the fashion styles and news footage lend an air of period authenticity, although trying to integrate events like the Cuban Missile Crisis requires some suspension of disbelief.<br/><br/>The film succeeds in portraying the mutants as a metaphor for racial discrimination and being treated as commodities by each respective side of the impending war. There are moral dilemmas as these kids express feelings and doubts including the question of whether they should accept being different or conform to the human race. Witness the interesting parallels with the Nazi genocide of World War II, and how Erik ironically assumes some of the corrupt evil from Sebastian, the very individual he hates.<br/><br/>This is a very attractive, talented group of actors led by McAvoy (Atonement), sounding like a grown up Harry Potter with a commanding presence and a deliciously charming Fassbender (quite effective in Inglourious Basterds) who is destined to conquer heroic or villainous roles for years to come. Bacon is featured prominently and has a field day hamming it up as the scheming Sebastian who is clearly modeled after Nazi doctor Josef Mengele. The scenes as Charles and Erik search for mutants are quite fun, and there are a couple of clever cameos.<br/><br/>The film has echoes of traditional James Bond films with its iconic evil characters bent on world domination. That's not a bad thing. Whether the box office will garner a direct sequel remains to be seen. Perhaps the one thing lacking is that it does not engage the audience the way films like Raiders of the Lost Ark and Spiderman did. The same sort of thing plagued the original Lara Croft: Tomb Raider film, only more so. What comic book enthusiasts will savor is a fairly entertaining recreation of what we know as the X Men, and while things don't perfectly mesh with the original X Men canon, this is a slick, intelligent attempt to rejuvenate a franchise much as J. J. Abrams' Star Trek relaunched that series."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","8","0","2","1 July 2011"," So the ultimate bromance started with Professor X and Magneto
","At last, I finally saw X-Men: First Class, seemed to take forever. I grew up with the cartoon X-Men, the good ol' 90's, how fun they were. When they made the movies, it seemed like we actually had great comic book films as well. The thing that makes X-Men so wonderful is that growing up, a lot of us feel different and X-Men was a way of saying that it's cool to be different and to embrace yourself. Everyone knows the characters and we each have our favorite. But to see where it all began was what I really wanted to know, what was the friendship between Charles and Erik like before their feud started? It's pretty much the equivalent of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Malcolm X, two men who had the same principles , but different concepts and how to execute their plans. Also this movie for me at least seemed to be a mixture of X-Men and the Bond films, I know this can't be just me, because a lot of the styles were similar and the villains seemed really inspired. X-Men: First Class could have been a sell out film for the summer, but turned into a really great film.<br/><br/>In 1962, Erik Lensherr is tracking down Schmidt to take revenge for killing his parents. In England, Oxford University graduate Charles Xavier is publishing his thesis on mutation; Raven, his foster sister, lives with him. A man named MacTaggert is seeking Xavier's advice on mutation, convinces him and Raven to join her at the CIA, where they convince Director McCone that mutants exist and Shaw is a threat. The CIA executives sponsor the mutants and invites them to the CIA's secret ""Division X"" facility. Xavier locates Shaw, arriving in time to stop Lensherr, who had attacked Shaw, from drowning as Shaw escapes. Xavier brings Lensherr to Division X, where they meet scientist Hank McCoy, a prehensile-footed mutant whom Xavier inadvertently outs as a mutant. Xavier uses a mutant-locating device to find and recruit mutants for training to stop Shaw. He and Lensherr find other mutants and now vow to stop Schmidt from taking over the Cold War and making it into WWIII.<br/><br/>The effects are very CGI at times, but every Magneto effect was killer, especially him lifting the submarine out of the water, it looked incredible. The powers for the newbies were cool and a lot of fun to choose which one I would rather have, I think I want each power for a different day. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender had great chemistry and their friendship was extremely strong on camera. The scene between them where Xavier is telling Erik how to control his powers was extremely moving, no pun intended. My only complaint being is that the film is a bit long and does drag on a bit, it seems like every film released in the theater is over 2 hours long. If the film carries on well, I'm perfectly fine with it, but in this case, the film could have been trimmed down a bit. But still, the movie is definitely worth the watch, it's a great summer blockbuster and in general a good movie that was a worthy addition to a terrific series of movies.<br/><br/>8/10"

","My summary pretty much says it all: if you have watched all previous X-Men movies and you watched Wolverine the last I assume it was a huge disappointment. Even the 3rd one (X-Men: The Last Stand) was remarkable considering the complete change in staff; particular emphasis on the director.<br/><br/>Anything, really, anything could have been much better than Wolverine, but no, the creators went even further and they managed to write a decent script and hire a very decent cast (we really should look forward to Mr McAvoy's and Fassbender's future roles).<br/><br/>Although both Magneto's and Xavier's character are very good, it is definitely the bad guy (played by Kevin Bacon) who steals the entire show. From start to finish Kevin's acting is extraordinary - he even shows off by speaking fluently in German and Russian.<br/><br/>I could go on listing the film's pros but I think it is not necessary. X-Men: First Class is highly recommended for all the avid X-Men fans out there; in fact, as it is a prequel, even those trying the familiarise themselves with the franchise for the first time can watch it before the rest. That is, of course, by leaving out the 4th installment which was the biggest letdown in the history of all the comic book adaptations.<br/><br/>I give it a solid 8 out of 10."

","The first two X-Men movies set a new standard for comic adaptation. After that there was a noticeable drop in quality. The most recent movie - X-Men Origins Wolverine - was only saved by Hugh Jackman's performance. Everything else was forgettable.<br/><br/>Luckily, X-Men First Class takes the series back to its original glory. As a prequel the movie is set during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962. Charles Xavier is about to become professor and Eric Lehnsherr is hunting down the Nazis who killed his family and especially his personal nemesis Sebastian Shaw.<br/><br/>Sure, not everything is perfect about this movie. Those who have a deeper knowledge about the Cuban Missile Crisis will notice many historic flaws. (Hint: Watch ""Thirteen Days"" or even better: ""The Fog of War"".) Then there are several continuity mistakes between the new movie and the old ones. (In the first movie, Xavier said that he met Eric at the age of 17. Now they are both much older. Also there is a big mistake that has to do with the 70s scene in the third movie, but I can't tell without providing a spoiler.) Some of the minor characters have very thin personalities. Also, the young Beast looks more cuddly than scary.<br/><br/>But who wants to argue about such minor details? When Kevin Bacon as super villain Shaw walks through his nuclear submarine surrounded by a freak show of henchmen, even Dr. No and Blofeld will pale in comparison. Without reaching a parody level like Austin Powers, we get a perfect representation of a 60s movie villain.<br/><br/>I also love the cameos of some original cast members, but I won't give those away.<br/><br/>More of the good stuff that worked, a fresh breeze of new stuff (60s nostalgia, historic background) and great acting especially by Fassbender and Bacon.

"j528491","Null","0","2","22 June 2011"," A new start for a dying franchise
","Marvel's X-men saga has been scrambled to say the least. It had a strong start with X- Men and X2, then it was almost destroyed with that awful X-Men: Last Stand. Once they realized the franchise was dead, they came out with the prequel ideas. First we got the origins of Wolverine, and now we have the origins of Proffesor Xavier and Magneto. X-Men: First Class takes us back to the 1960s, in the midst of the Cuban Missile Crisis, when Charles (James McAvoy) and Erik (Michael Fassbender) were allies. They have to join forces and create a team of mutants to take down Erik's previous tormentor, Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon). <br/><br/>The acting in this movie is great all around. Each actor takes on their character and adapts it in a very convincing way, namely, Fassbender and Jennifer Lawrence (Mystique). McAvoy did a great job with Charles as well. It was a lot of fun to see the fun-loving partier before he became a respected professor. <br/><br/>There were a lot of scenes that really jumped out at me. One was the training sequence in which Charles taught the mutants how to harness their individual powers. I attribute a lot of this scene to the score provided by Henry Jackman. It was important to see how he is able to work with the powers of others, including Erik's. <br/><br/>There were also a few scenes that were almost too impossible to enjoy. These were mainly the action scenes. One in particular, was bordering on ridiculous. There were a few scenes that were repetitive as well. I would have liked to see Jennifer Lawrence's character in action more because she is one of the central characters. <br/><br/>I would like to see First Class become a franchise entirely of its own. Apart from a surprising, yet hilarious cameo, the movie had very little that made it a prequel to the 2000 X-Men. The movie had me gripped to the end seeing the transformation of Erik to Magneto. Some parts had me laughing while not being afraid to cross a few lines. I wouldn't be disappointed if First Class became the future of X-Men"
"fatsamuraireviews","8","0","1","22 June 2011"," X-Men:First Class a ""preboot""
","Yes I just made that up. A reboot done in a prequel ""Preboot""(patent pending). I get a nickle whenever someone uses it.<br/><br/>X-Men: First Class tells us the story of the origins of Professor X and his school. It takes us back to the beginning even before the Professor was a professor. Learning about how the movie universe started was a good step in setting down the two different versions of the X-Men. Yes this movie takes liberties from the comic books, but it does do a good job of going back and laying out some of the past history between Professor X and Magneto. I liked watching the foundation of the war between the humans and the mutants. We see the development of the relationship and friendship that brings Charles and Eric together and how they worked with the same goal but from two completely different motivations. From an entertainment standpoint, this movie gets a green light from me. I know that some aspects were changed from the comic book but it was still an entertaining movie. Go and see it if you enjoyed any of the previous films.<br/><br/>Please read more at http://fatsamuraireviews.blogspot.com"
"MercurioKnight","8","0","1","21 June 2011"," An exciting reinvention of the franchise, though not without its drawbacks.
","A good movie, though it has its faults. The number one fault is the casting for Emma Frost, absolutely terrible (she just didn't fit, even in the pictures I saw early on). On the other side of things, Prof. X and Magneto were cast to perfection. Kevin Bacon makes a wonderful Sebastian Shaw, and everybody else does a good job. It was hard for me to get into 'young mystique', though, not that the actress doesn't do a good job. I'm sure that will fade upon repeated viewings. Other little faults are things to do with continuity errors.<br/><br/>POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILERS For example, I distinctly remember Magneto giving a reason as to his knowledge of Cerebro being that he helped to build it. This movie completely negates that notion. Also, according to professor X, the team was affectionately named the X-Men by the children who went to the school, though that notion also has been negated. First Class sets these things up so that they make sense, but these notions were already previously established. X-Men 3 has definitely been negated by this movie. In X3, it is established that Prof X and Magneto are still working together to recruit students much later than when First Class obviously takes place. So, uumm, I know X3 is like the bastard child, but still, it is part of the continuity. Bryan Singer might have something to do with this, since he co-wrote the screenplay and he not too long ago made a Superman movie pretty much ignoring the other movies past the 2nd, but still sort of following the continuity of the first two. If it was just a matter of completely negating the 3rd x-men, OK... but the other problems affect the first two, so I think just treating this (they want to make it a trilogy) as its own continuity outside the other films is the way to go, much like the many different takes on the characters in the comicbooks and the teams over the years depending on the era they were written and the writer/artist team, or the many different incarnations of Superman/Batman/etc (Everything from Smallville, Lois and Clark, to the superman movies and the TV show).<br/><br/>One last thing, Alex Summers, aka Havok, is supposedly the younger brother of Scott Summers, aka Cyclops, yet that isn't the case here.<br/><br/>END SPOILERS<br/><br/>Good movie, good plot, some good character development for Prof X and Magneto, pacing is nice, using team suits more like the comicbooks and less leathery was a nice change. I don't think I liked the film as much as I was hoping to, but overall I do like it. If Emma Frost wasn't such an eyesore (if the role was cast and written better), all the other flaws are relatively minor in comparison to the whole. I so wanted to be completely transported the way the first two X-men movies did... but First Class doesn't quite succeed in that regard.<br/><br/>Lastly, talking about why Emma Frost was so wrong. The Emma Frost in the comicbooks does wear skimpy outfits, but she has an authority to her, a presence. She is more than a mere second in command. In first class, she is turned into a 3rd rate version of Mystique from the original movies, except with psychic powers, a lack of any kind of grabbing presence (which mystique had in spades in every frame she's in in the original movies), and obviously no shape shifting ability, though she does 'diamond up'. Lame in every way in this movie and the actress was a poor one to boot, obviously cast for her looks, not because she had any real talent (at least not on display)."

","This is a very disappointing movie to me. I loved all the X-Men movies. Not nice enough and maybe would have put me to sleep. The characters here was awfully dull and not one bit exciting. I expected a lot more action and wolverine did the right thing by telling them to ...Off. X-Men and X-Men 2 was the best If there other X-men are like this forget about it making money. X men 3 was OK. True die hard X-Men addicts will not like this at all. Next one better be a whole lot better than this! I hope they did not spend too much on this one because I don't think they will even break even, But then again just because of there other X-Men alone will bring people."
"abrahamkent","7","0","2","17 June 2011"," The Original Subtext Is Eventually Back! Even More.
","Under Bryan Singer's supervision in the story of First Class, the original subtext of the X-Men franchise is eventually revived, even with a scent of bro-romance or being camp I suppose. The lines in it couldn't be more specific, further than ""Have you tried not being a mutant?"" in X2(2003), like ""You didn't ask so I didn't tell,"" ""You want society to accept you, but you can't even accept yourselves?"" ""I always believed I couldn't be the only one in the world who was different,"" ""You have no idea what I'd give to be normal!"" or some slogans like ""mutant and proud"" kind of lines. There are plenty of symbolic images to discuss. In the final montage scene, the coin, pricking into Shaw's head, which is being occupied by Charles, could be interpreted as a motive of Erik's own revenge obviously, or the two sides of one coin as the mutants' stands since the symbol X is simply a mutation from the Nazi Swastika, and the spirit of Swastika is what Erik holds afterward as Charles standing for X; even this head-pricking scene, when Charles' power is inside Shaw's head and Erik uses the coin as his weapon(PRICK) into Shaw's head(BODY) filled by Charles, is an intensive way of buggery lastly terminating the two confidants' intimate relationship. More, one bullet(LOAD) swept by Erik finally strikes into the last bone of Charles' back near the BUTT; then Erik holds him, tearing, pulling it out for him... kinky, isn't it? Besides, about the yellow uniforms, Is that some homage to the original suit in the comics? Although Henry Jackman, one of the ghost composers and the hank of Hans Zimmer, borrows Death Camp, the score by Michael Kamen from X-Men(2000, is it also a homage to Kamen's death?), in the opening to review Erik's misery and the very beginning of this series, most of the time his soundtrack is a bit blatant, disturbing some short but delicate moments. Yet, all in all, X-Men: First Class, as a prequel, after X2, deserves the title of a first-class X-Men movie. By the by, since Kevin Bacon as a bad ass mutant, I kept recalling his notorious Hollow Man(2000).<br/><br/>Charles: We have a PROPOSITION for you. Logan: Go FXCK﻿ yourselves.

"rezan00","10","0","1","15 June 2011"," For the Greater Good... of mutants
","""We have it in us to be the better men."" ""We already are.""<br/><br/>When Erick Lenscher uttered those words I finally understood Magneto. I've been reading comics since the 90's and the X-Men have always fascinated me. I heard someone say there were three universes in comics: The DC Universe, the Marvel Universe and the X-Men Universe. Sure the members of the X-Men have appeared and even fought with other Marvel heroes but their struggle has been always apart from the other human heroes. And their main antagonist is Magneto, someone who thinks he is fighting for a noble cause: his and the X-Men's survival. I've always dumped him with other misguided villains but when Erik Lenscher said those words, Magneto is crystallized in his most basic form. He considers himself a totally different being from the rest of humanity. He might even see other humans as aliens or insects and it shows in his actions in the movies as well as in the comics. He does not view human life as sacred like his friend Charles Xavier. That may be the one thing that separates them. Magneto did not flinch from reversing the rockets to kill thousands of soldiers in their warships, he did not flinch when he reversed Cerebro to eliminate humans instead of mutants and he did not flinch when he reversed Earth's magnetic poles and killed millions. That scene when Charles tried his best to understand and even change Erik made the movie great for me. <br/><br/>Also we should not disregard Charles Xavier. He change from a beer chugging lunatic to a serious and dedicated CIA recruit is a bit jarring. But I would think he did not change at all. From the scene in the kitchen when he, as a young boy, first meets Raven to the final scene in the movie, he did not change at all. I would guess he was always composed and aware of everything around him even when he was being a fool. <br/><br/>I liked how he trained the young X-Men and Magneto. It is not hard to see how he will mold his family home into the Xavier School for Gifted Youngsters. His portrayal as the person who always have the answers and who always knows everything while not being obnoxious or arrogant is perfect. I think other from telepathic abilities his other mutation is extreme intelligence."
"jdkraus","9","0","2","14 June 2011"," Potential for redeeming the X-men
","This is the fifth X-men and one may think that 4 following the original are too many. I originally would think this, but X-men First Class redeems the series. Unlike the previous two X-men's, this one is not rushed nor is the CGI the main goal. There is actually a very interesting plot, likable characters, and it is well paced. This X-men is particularly special because it explores how many of the mutants have become the way they were in the other features, such as how Xavier opened up his school and how Magneto and Mystique ended up being villains. <br/><br/>The cast is very good. James McAvoy is simply a great actor, and he pulls it off swell as Dr. Xavier. The actor who played Magneto (I can't remember his name) is flawless. He embodies the tortured soul of his character very well. It is inevitable that he becomes a villain, but even so, I still root for him. Jennifer Lawrence is also a nice and a sexy addition as Mystique. Kevin Bacon plays an excellent villain—he needs to be the bad guy more often. I even smiled at the little cameo that Hugh Jackman performed as Wolverine—though it is very short. <br/><br/>The story, well, it is purely a work of fiction, but it incorporates some historical events that somehow blend into the film's plot perfectly. The technical aspects are mostly great, but some of the CGI sequences seemed to bother me. One in particular is when a submarine crashes into a beach, destroying a boatload of trees in its path. I don't know why, but it seemed fake to me. Perhaps this is because I am pursuing a potential career in 3d animation and I always tend to analyze the work of the visual effects artists more carefully than most viewers. Then again, the whole premise of mutants living amidst society is a bit silly and cartoonish. Anyway, X-men First Class pretty much summed up my satisfactions of a great, blockbuster hit: acting, story, solid pacing, and mostly decent film-making. If there is another X-men, the writers and filmmakers need to make one with the ingredients I listed above. If this is the last one to be made, Hollywood has made a great close to the series.<br/><br/>My rating: 3.5/4"
"the_goldy_gopher-933-985555","7","0","2","14 June 2011"," A Good Movie that Should have been Great.
","I consider myself as your typical fanboi with an independent point of view. So after watching ""X-Men: First Class"" on opening night I faced a dilemma; I was unsure whether I liked the movie or not. It really took me three showings to make up my mind. As a standalone film ""X-Men: First Class"" would arguably be one of the better if not the best Super Hero films releases of all time. There is little question that the cinematography is first rate, the story line moves along well, the pace is good, the acting is better than expected and as an observer you were drawn into the movie. <br/><br/>""X-Men: First Class"" is not a standalone film, it is a prequel to the successful X-Men Trilogy of movies that at least two of the movies well liked. It also based upon the long-running Comic Book(s) with several successful TV series, off shoots and an extremely loyal following. To me the question is where does the movie fail? After three viewings of the movie it fails for me because it could have been a great movie rather than a good movie, had the leadership in the project put their noses to the grindstones and really worked at it. An example of this, the story moves along in history without much continuity to begin with, starting in Poland, jumping to New York, then Switzerland, than Had the producers really thought about it, could you just imagine an introduction narrated by Sir Ian McKellan and Sir Patrick Stewart telling their back story in a scene that takes place somewhere between the second and third movie and linking us the audience to the existing X-Men Trilogy? Or if that was not possible having Moria MacTaggert providing a debriefing as the opening. The first fifteen minutes of the film with a something to connect the continuity would have been extraordinary rather than the required back story. The movie attempts to preserve the continuity to the X-Men Trilogy on a number of occasions and ignores it on others. You must do one or the other, I honestly hoped they would have had better continuity between the four movies it was cool seeing the Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and Rebecca Romijn popped in and the comments about the older selves, however coupled with the elements of change, why bother? I understand the need to minimize the number of characters used or introduced (See ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" for an example of a failure in that regard) however here is a case where a couple of extra characters would have greatly enhanced the story and allowed characters like Moria MacTaggert to move into her more appropriate role. As a minor detail that really irks the movie buff in me the movie really needs to be re-cut, you have 15 minutes of good pace and action and then a scene that takes two minutes and you asking yourself what did the scene accomplish. An example of a well cut movie is ""Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" theatrical release. While I prefer the Extended Edition of that movie, the theatrical release was very much pointed story about Frodo, or Frodo Centric. It provided excellent pace and worked well, this movie has about four scenes that left you going hey, why is it important how does it extend the story. Finally this is a movie screaming Director's Extended Edition for your DVD viewing pleasure. In most cases I really hate that and this follows that rule. Unless you are going to turn a three hour movie into a four hour movie and fill in all the story line holes (See LotR). The movies has a number of missing parts to the story line and with all the geeks out there going to nitpick the writers know this, so obviously the storyline was filled in. Would have adding 15 minutes of film changed the number of people in the seats, in my opinion it would have gotten many of the Fanbois to see the film a third and fourth time without losing much in the way of audience. Now we wait and wonder"
"PWNYCNY","8","0","2","14 June 2011"," Lively movie; weak story
","How can one judge a movie that on its face is campy? Can a campy movie be judged on the same basis as let's say a non-campy movie? This movie is highly entertaining, yet tells a story that is so absurd that it's almost laughable, and the movie is not a comedy. The mutants are wonderful and their powers are impressive, but so what? The audience can relate to a character like, let's say, Superman, who has super powers but otherwise is no different from his human counterparts. X-men however are quite different which makes them a less lovable, far more weird, and potentially more menacing. One does not have to be concerned that Batman is going to to a number on Gotham City or that Spiderman is going to weave a huge web around his friends. Yet one is not sure about these X-men. Some are good and some are bad. It makes for a lively movie with lots of special effects and all kinds of story twists which grabs and keeps the audience's attention, yet leaves one wondering: why do these X-men exist in the first place? What is their mission?"
"ARTaylor","8","0","1","13 June 2011"," Makes X-Men Interesting Again
","X-Men has been up and down the last decade. Singer's two movies were terrific, showcasing the complexity of the X-Men universe. Then came the over-bloated The Last Stand. Wolverine was a slight improvement but it can't be argued that it's anything more than mediocre. Fox needed something to redeem the mutants' saga and they did it.<br/><br/>Singer returns, though only as producer, and brings sensibility and intelligence back. Vaughn brings a terrific sense of style to the movie that hasn't been seen since Singer left. The story deals with the formation of the X-Men, which was briefly alluded to in the first movie. It's an interesting time period to show because Xavier can still walk, Magneto is good, and mutants aren't widely known to the general public. Like the movies, the comics have alluded to this period quite a bit but not shown much of it. Like Batman Begins, it's great to see how the characters all became the people we know.<br/><br/>The acting is good all around. McAvoy and Fassbender really hit it out of the park. Those two really disappear into the role and make them their own. The Charles-Erik relationship was the highlight of the movie as it is in the first film. Lawrence is great as a young and innocent Mystique, though I wish she had a stronger story. It's a bit inconsistent as she's in love with Charles, Beast, and then Erik, plus her ""accepting who she is"" moment is rather forced. Kevin Bacon also does a terrific job. Unfortunately he's such a recognizable face all I can see is the guy from Footloose and Tremors. The rest of the cast is good but not great. Beast and Moira have plenty of good moments. But the rest are mostly there to fulfill plot points.<br/><br/>It's not quite as violent as Vaughn's Kick-Ass but it gets bloody especially as Erik goes on his Nazi hunt. Many people die, though some seem included just to die. The action is exciting and should keep you in suspense. Though, the problem with any prequel is that we know how certain characters will end up. There's plenty of humor to break up the action and exposition. From little one-liners to recurring gags, it's often laugh-out-loud funny. Though they overuse the joke regarding Xavier's hair.<br/><br/>Although it never really reaches the heights of Singer's two X-Men movies. There are a couple problems that keep it from being perfect. <br/><br/>First, I wish the movie would decide between being a reboot or prequel. It's a fine movie on its own, but its indecision drags it down for someone who, like me, has followed the franchise and loves (most but not all) the movies. There's numerous references to the previous movies including a recreation of X-Men's first scene and cameos by Jackman and Romijn. But then there's things like building Cerebro, Magneto's helmet, and time line issues that couldn't possibly make it fit with the others. Imagine if Batman Begins tried to be a loose prequel to Burton's Batman. I love them both but would like Begins just a little less if they tried to include Burton references. I know the producers weren't concerned with continuity. But I would have preferred if they would decide between being its own entity or a part of the team.<br/><br/>While the 1960s are a fascinating time regarding civil rights, the film doesn't really exploit that at all. Besides a few groovy's from Xavier and Frost's hair style, it never really felt like the 60s. They all acted like modern day people, especially the kids. Then there's no real mention of then-current politics. The Cuban Missile Crisis was just a brief side story for the real plan. But there's no mention of MLK or Malcolm X, the two inspirations for Xavier and Magneto, and nothing about civil rights protests. Since the government is introduced to mutants in the movie no one knows about them yet so there's no way they could have the time for anything like the Registration Act, Sentinels, or the Friends of Humanity hate group. Besides the Missile Crisis and the age of Erik and Charles it could have been set in any period. It's a wasted opportunity.<br/><br/>The movie has one problem in common with Wolverine, it's trying to get to that Pre-X-Men point too quickly. (Only SPOILER related paragraph) Both movies try to introduce so much about the world AND get it to that familiar point that it shortchanges the characters more than they should. We know that Charles looses the use of his legs and that he and Erik split up. But this was supposed to be the first in a new trilogy, so why burn through so much of the story at once? It's like if The Phantom Menace ended with Anakin becoming Darth Vader. That prequel trilogy spent more time building up the relationship between the two heroes so when one did fall, like Magneto will, it was all the more tragic. Here, we got a glimpse of the Charles-Erik relationship but it felt like it only lasted weeks when it should have been years. Like Star Wars, they should have ended the trilogy with Magneto's turn as they never truly befriended each other here.<br/><br/>Now don't take my last three points as meaning I disliked the film. I loved it. They're just things I wished they improved on. Otherwise it's a terrific film that did what it needed to most importantly, make X-Men interesting again. No more dumb things like killing Cyclops in five minutes or making Deadpool mute. They can finally get back on track towards making the franchise fun for fans and audiences alike. But please, just pick whether it's a prequel or reboot, but not try to do both."

"timdalton007","8","0","1","13 June 2011"," X-Men: In The Beginning
","We seem to be in the midst of the summer of franchise building and rebuilding this year. As such then, it perhaps shouldn't come as any surprise that a new movie that restarts the series based on the Marvel Comics X-Men character's has been released. Yet to dismiss X-Men: First Class as simply being little more then just yet another movie that is starting (or in this case restarting) a franchise would be wrong. It is that, but it's also something more then just that.<br/><br/>Considering the mark left by the previous X-Men cast, the casting of this movie is all important and the results are fantastic. James McAvoy as Charles Xavier and Michael Fassbender as Erik Lehnsherr (aka Magneto) both take roles upon which huge marks were left by two very well known actors (Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen respectively) and very much make them there own, especially in McAvoy's case. Indeed the entire cast of young actors and actresses does well including Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique, Rose Byrne as CIA agent Moira MacTaggert, Nicholas Hoult as Hank McCoy aka Beast and January Jones as Emma Frost. Perhaps the biggest surprise of the movie is the villainous mutant Sebastian Shaw played by Kevin Bacon, who clearly enjoys the chance to play a bad guy and is a fine villain at that. Backing them is a supporting cast made up of fine character actors including Oliver Platt as the ""man in black suit"" (seriously that's how he's credited), Matt Craven as CIA Director John McCone and Don Creech as William Stryker plus a couple of nice cameos from two previous X-Men stars. The result overall is a nicely acted movie all round.<br/><br/>The production values work well in bringing the 1962 setting of the movie to life. Indeed the production design of Chris Seagers is highly evocative of the Ken Adam designed sets of the 1960s James Bond movies (indeed the movie seems to replicate Ken Adams Pentagon war room set from Stanley Kubrick's 1964 film Dr Strangelove) especially with their now retro-futuristic feel. The costume design does much the same job of evoking the era, especially with the costumes for the X-Men and the female character's. The use of archival footage to set-up the Cuban Missile Crisis and the threat of nuclear war also highly evokes the era as well in a way that neither sets nor costumes can. Mention should also be made of the score by Henry Jackman which, though not necessarily evocative of the era, is nevertheless a good score that adds much to the movie as any good score should.<br/><br/>After three X-Men movies and a prequel movie for Wolverine, First Class restarts the franchise by taking us to the earliest years of the X-Men. The year is 1962, the year that the world found itself on the brink of nuclear war with the Cuban Missile Crisis. Suppose, just suppose for a moment, that a plot by power hungry mutant Sebastian Shaw to destroy humanity and cause the rise of the mutants was behind the entire crisis? That in a nutshell is the plot of the movie. True, it has more historical errors then I can list at the moment but, for once, I'm excusing it. Especially as without them there would be no climatic battle and what would a superhero action movie be without that?<br/><br/>Thankfully though, the movie does more then just action. Perhaps taking a cue from the 2009 Star Trek film, the story is as much about bringing the character's that have become so well known and giving them a new beginning. Indeed the movie plays up the friendships, rivalries and relationships between the various members of the ""first class"". In particular this restarting of the X-Men series brings the at times testy friendship between Xavier and Erik and the relationship between Mystique and Hank are brought into focus which is made all the more intriguing because we all ready know where both of those are going, even if the latter does evoke some clichés in the meantime. The result is a refreshing new beginning.<br/><br/>Indeed X-Men: First Class is just that: a refreshing new beginning. From good acting from a new group of X-Men to production values that evoke the 1962 setting, the movie shows a new side to the world of the X-Men. Indeed the script lays much of that groundwork as well with a story that's full of action yet brings the character's into focus as well. As a result, it'll be interesting to see where this ""first class"" goes from here after what might well the best X-Men movie to date."
"DragoonKain","8","0","1","10 June 2011"," Really Good, but please make up your mind about the movie continuity, Marvel
","This might have been the best X-Men movie yet. I say might, because there are some serious problems with the continuity of this movie series that has been bothering me since X-Men Origins:Wolverine came out.<br/><br/>It seems that Marvel can't make up its mind whether it wants to reboot the franchise, or establish an episodic series of movies with their prequels (a la Star Wars). I can see why they're struggling with this decision, because there are benefits and drawbacks to both. The benefit to a true prequel, is that the narrative of the story remains intact across all movies, and you could watch them in order and experience a complete story. Comic book fans love this type of story telling, and for X-Men, which is, first and foremost, a comic book series with a rich history going all the way back to 1963, this is the most obvious and sensible way to tell the story.<br/><br/>But prequels are very difficult to pull off successfully. Unless the whole storyline is pre-written before anything gets released, it's very difficult to retro-actively tell a backstory without running into continuity errors. Since the ending of the story is already written in stone, you are writing yourself into a corner every time you try to tell a prequel story. And since films are limited by a number of other factors (running time, budget, actor availability, etc.), the difficulty of pulling this off increases. Often the quality of the story is sacrificed in the name of continuity, which can lead to some very convoluted story lines that would turn off any new viewer immediately.<br/><br/>Because of these difficulties, a reboot is often preferred when doing a movie that's supposed to take place before the events in the already established series. Batman Begins did this and they had a lot of success with it. The writer and director has a lot more freedom with a reboot, and can tell the story they want to tell without being constrained by what was already released.<br/><br/>But Marvel can't seem to make up its mind whether it wants to reboot their franchises or tell a true prequel. I first had inklings of this when they released the Incredible Hulk in 2008, which seemed to ignore the previous 2005 Hulk movie, yet at the same time sort of continued the story. Then in 2009 with X-Men Origins: Wolverine, which was supposed to be a prequel, it was clear they were ignoring some aspects of the original X-Men films. One particular inconsitency was Tyler Maine's Sabretooth, who never recognized Wolverine in X-Men 1 (2000), but with X-Men Origins:Wolverine we're supposed to believe that Lieve Schreiber's Sabretooth was Wolverine's brother and closest friend for nearly 100 years. So was it a reboot? Or was it just a mistake? Most likely it was neither. They wanted to tell the story they wanted to tell and purposely ignored the fact that it conflicted with what was established before so they simply retconned some aspects. It's the middle ground approach, and comic book fans know that it's sloppy storytelling.<br/><br/>Without spoiling anything I'll just say that X-Men:First Class has similar problems with it's continuity with the other films. You're never sure if it's supposed to be a reboot or a prequel. It's a retcon, pure and simple. Now, the anal retentive aspect of my nature is infuriated by this. With comic books that have been going on for decades, like the X-Men, some retcons are forgiven. They're necessary evils when you have hundreds of issues or episodes to keep track of. But I'm less forgiving with this movie series. There have only been four movies before this one. It's not like the X-Men movie series is so vast that they need to retcon it as much as they do. They were already retconning after the third film. It's lazy, and the inconsistencies are so obvious that you don't have to be a fan to notice it. Just watch each of the movies one time and you'll spot them.<br/><br/>But, at the same time, the less anal half of my nature is more forgiving of X-Men: First Class. Why? Because it was actually a really good movie. Honestly, the story was excellent and entertaining and the characters well portrayed. I was loving James McAvoy's portrayal of Xavier in particular. And, most of all, it was true to the heart and soul of X-Men, a comic book series I have fond memories of reading as a kid. I was less forgiving of the Wolverine movie, since it was not as good and had just as many continuity problems.<br/><br/>X-Men:First Class was really good. But it could have been great. If they had done a true reboot they could have made a better film. For one, they could have used the original X-Men team (Cyclops, Angel, Beast, Iceman, Marvel Girl). Cyclops, in particular, I felt should have been one of the first students. In the comics, his role is iconic as the leader and most loyal and longstanding member of the X-Men. I don't feel any of the films did his character justice. Instead with the exception of Beast, we got a bunch of minor X-Men characters, many of whom were never actually X-Men members (some were villains) to represent the first X-Men team. A few of them I didn't even recognize as ever having been in the comics. It still works, but for fans of X-Men, it just seems ... off. And since they pretty much rewrote the history they established in the other movies with all of the retconning they did, it simply wasn't necessary. It could have been a great reboot. But as it stands it's just a really good film."

","The prequel which has a few plot holes if we compare to the previous X-Men movies, brings some serious action and drama as the summer kicks in and we enter a summer of full of comic book movies.'X-Men:First Class' isn't the greatest comic book movie of all time but sure it's a hundred if not thousand times better than previously was expected to be which was caused by the so called 'rushed production' people claimed to be and that resulted countless negative critics and opinion even before the actual release of the movie. The movie is set primary in the early 60's (which can be a home age to the launch of the most known MARVEL comics titles as well) during the Cuban Missile Crisis.The actors did a terrific job portraying the characters, especially Michael Fassbender who was the perfect choice to play Erik Lansherr the man known to become Magneto, Charles Xavier's and the X-Men's future archenemy. Many claimed even before the release that the movie is actually a reboot of the old franchise but the surprise cameos say otherwise so this can be taken either as the previous statement was false or the movie is a simple prequel for the previous ones only with a few details changed. My biggest problem with the movie was that they introduced many interesting mutants(both heroes and villains) but didn't 'used' them and some felt wasted because they haven't been explored properly. So are you either a comic book fan or a movie x-men fan or just someone who is looking for an awesome action/drama movie to start off the summer with a bang,I say just go and see the movie. So far this movie is the best I've seen this year."

For example, why didn't they just cast Kevin Bacon as the Nazi soldier in the beginning? The two actors looked nothing alike. The film didn't explain itself clear enough either. Now I realise it's a 're-boot' not a prequel. But that's just plain ol' lazy. Overall, it was pretty damn entertaining and impressive visually.

"Nrgravois","7","0","1","13 June 2011"," A fun, well-made summer hit
","It's hard, these days, to go to the movies to see a superhero movie and NOT expect greatness, or at least something close to it. With such classics recently like The Dark Knight, Iron Man, and Kick-Ass, we superhero buffs have it pretty muchly made, apart from a few minor bumps like Thor. All this in mind, I sat down with my buddies expecting greatness, and was not disappointed with an opening scene that almost moved me to tears. A boy in a concentration camp has his mother ruthlessly gunned down in front of him by a cruel Nazi doctor. It's like Schindler's List meets Batman. Instant Oscar material, right? Well, not exactly. Following this perfectly executed scene is an hour and a half of not so perfectness. It's funny that after years of fancy special effects driven films, filmmakers have finally gotten down said effects to a tee, while tending to throw that out the window with terrible acting and even worse scripts; however, with X-Men: First Class, it was exactly the opposite. Every actor in this movie flawlessly created realistic mutants whom the audience could actually relate to, particularly McAvoy and Fassbender, the films lead roles. The script was equally flawless, surprisingly lacking in cheesy lines and jokes, but still managing to be fun and lighthearted when need be. Then we get to the effects...not the action effects, no, those were spectacular, in fact you could almost feel Magneto lifting Kevin Bacon's ridiculously huge and lavish submarine from the depths of the Atlantic, but rather the effects and make-up of the mutants themselves. These ranged from mediocre at best, to just plain ridiculous. The mediocre: Angel's wings, Shaw's goofy helmet and Havok's havoc wreaking. The ridiculous: Mystique's transforming, Azazel in general, and Beast's make-up, which looked quite like a hairier version of Chaka from Land of the Lost. But, as bad as some of those things could be, I found myself not caring, and still managing to be swept up in the action packed fun of it all. You may remember I said that the middle hour and a half wasn't great, but what about the last half hour? Superhero movie perfection. A perfect climax, perfect resolution, perfect showing of the cause of the schism between Prof. X and Magneto, perfect cliffhanger ending, and perfect set up to a new series of movies. Was the movie perfect? Nah. Was it great? Almost. Was it one helluva fun ride and good summer action flick? One hundred percent yes."
"EnderAK08","7","0","1","12 June 2011"," Puts the series back where it should be
","After a disappointing Wolverine (2009) and X-Men: The Last Stand (2006), director Matt Vaughan and some outstanding lead actors put the X-Men film series back on track in this film. It opens fittingly with a young Erik/Magneto, being dragged away from his parents in the same concentration camp as X-Men (1999). <br/><br/>We then begin watching the rise of two contrasting figures: Erik (Eric Fassbender), and Charles Xavier (James McAvoy). It is primarily because of these two that the movie succeeds. Fassbender plays a cold, vengeful Magneto with enough sympathy that we might believe he's a good guy, while McAvoy shows Xavier as brilliant and young: smart enough to negotiate with CIA, but cocky enough to have silly pick-up lines for co-eds at a university. Their developing ideologies are constantly butting heads, but since this a prequel, we see their efforts to band together come to fruition before the story pulls them apart. <br/><br/>The Cold War is played up to great effect, and the film sometimes seems like an early entry in the James Bond series - generals stare at giant maps of the world, have meetings in casinos and the characters rendezvous with the CIA. The downside of all the detail is that the movie literally races along, especially in the first hour, and sacrifices supporting character development. <br/><br/>The rest of the characters are one-dimensional in nature or simply guided along their paths as required by original trilogy. Mystique is essentially the same character as ever, as are Beast, Moira MacTaggert, and a few other supporting figures. The story sometimes feels like a giant set-up for the trilogy, with plot points existing simply to keep continuity. <br/><br/>The usual metaphors remain - analogies of discrimination, racial profiling, the difficulties of ""coming out,"" and the subtle references with Xavier as Martin Luther King and Magneto as Malcolm X. And in the end, everyone ends up where they should be. And there's a great cameo.<br/><br/>7/10"

You are then geared up for the action in the second half...yes i was hoping for a lot more action and fight sequences but that nevertheless it did not change my views about the film.

","The movie follows the development of a not so unlikely friendship between a young Charles Xavier (soon to be Professor X) and Eric Lensherr (Magneto). Though the story successfully ties in critical world events of the past, which serve to date the piece and connect with audiences, I found the film lacked a certain depth expected of a Hollywood production. Certain still camera shots, the noticeable lack of extra's and dialogue that seemed far too convenient at times made this installment of the X-Men franchise appear more like the traditional 2-D cartoon than a live action film. This from a Marvel super-hero fan: I grew up reading the books. Hollywood's cutting corners yet ticket prices are going up. Decent film. Wait for Digital Download / Blu-Ray / DVD."

","First of all, great job with this one, it completely filled my expectations and was really nice to watch after seeing the other 4. But now, what I thought of immediately since I'm a scientist..<br/><br/>X-Men projects evolutiontheory on the big screen. Place yourself in Magneto's shoes and think in the future whilst keeping in mind what Charles Darwin said. ""Survival of the fittest"" ""Mutations => variation => evolution"" ""Those who are adapted the best have most chance of surviving""<br/><br/>So think what would happen hypothetically if there were mutants like Magneto. Mutants who turn against humans who don't have these mutans skills, because that's what they are, skills. We would turn us against the mutants because society fears everything that's different and stronger. This will result in a war which would be won by the mutants for sure. Add a lot of time to this concept and you have a world with just mutants, or should I say, a world with gifted people where the normal people of today would be seen as ""those with a handicap"". This is what evolution is about, the best adapted ones will survive, and that's what's so nice if you think further than just the movie but follow some concepts of certain personages. But that would result in a world with even more chaos with only mutants, or not?"

"Rynobro","8","0","1","12 June 2011"," Although the film felt a little bit rushed, overall it was extremely effective.
","I, for one, was extremely apprehensive when I heard about an X-Men prequel. Bryan Singer's first two films will remain near and dear to my heart as superhero films go, and when Brett Ratner's ""The Last Stand"" hit theaters, it destroyed my hope to ever see another great X-Men film. While Singer's films were smart, carefully plotted, action films, the last two (The Last Stand, Wolverine) felt like a rushed, disorganized, cash grab. That being said, I expected nothing but the same from ""First Class."" However, what we got, while was still very rushed, was an incredible superhero film. Fassbender really floored me as, a man who would one day be Magneto, Erik Lesher. The story explaining how a mild mannered young Jewish boy in a Nazi occupied Germany became a powerful villain, hellbent on ridding the world of the human race was very compelling, and in my opinion what made this film as enjoyable as it was. However, I feel the fact that it was a mutant who created the monster that is Magneto, makes his vendetta against the human race seem a little less justified. While McAvoy is solid as always, I feel it's the supporting cast that really steals the film here. Lawrence really earns your sympathy as her character as she begins her transition from a self loathing little mutant, unsure of her identity, and slowly begins to accept who she really is, and the awareness that no human ever would. I have to give Vaughn his due here... It takes a very good director to make such a big budget action film, with shooting locations that span the globe in such a short amount of time, and still make it, not only watchable, but genuinely compelling. Now, given that in less than a year, the film suffered rewrites due to plot changes (going from an origin film just about Magneto, to the beginning of the X-Men), and just what Vaughn felt wouldn't feel fresh (scene's which he compared similar to fights that took place in Inception), he did, what I feel, was the best job any director could have done with this film in such a short period of time. I also feel, despite the fact that there are some continuity errors between this and the previous series, that this fits in as a excellent companion piece. I highly recommend giving this one a chance."

Compared to Halle Berry, Ellen Page, Danny Huston and others from the previous installments, the cast was very low caliber and it showed.<br/><br/>One other complaint.

","Overall, I loved the movie. A few things didn't make sense, such as how nuclear technology was making some people become mutants, and for that matter, in unique and always advantageous ways. But that's small. <br/><br/>What really bugged me was how *every* female in the movie was hot. It's like you could not be cast unless you had a pretty face and certain dimensions. Was this true for the men too? Not at all. Even accounting for the fact that the majority of secondary characters would need to be men because of the time period, the majority of the male characters were in the average category. Women clearly couldn't play the same role as men, they had to be eye candy as well. <br/><br/>In this vein, the sexualization was in every scene. For example, women always had their suits unzipped way down to show cleavage, even when they wore the same outfits as men. It was kind of ridiculous.<br/><br/>Granted most Hollywood movies are like this, and maybe I am just stating the obvious, but this issue seemed particularly egregious in this movie and was hard for me to get past. <br/><br/>Anyway, besides that, it is really fun and engrossing and not to be missed."

The effects are a grade A, and the dialogue is interesting. The movie is well directed by Vaughn, who keeps the movie dramatic, and thrilling.<br/><br/>The movie starts is a NAZI concentration camp in 1944, where we see Erik Lehnsherr who is being forced to display his mutant power, when he's separated from his mother.

Raven (Jennifer Lawrence) to have grown to be a frustrated mutant as she longed envision life without her mutation.<br/><br/>We get to see how Hank (Beast) developed a serum to hide their differences from the human world go bad, and they added a relationship though quite small between Hank and Raven. <br/><br/>The movie's chief focus was on the beginning of it all, we get to see how close Charles Xavier and Magneto was and how their differences drove both party apart. As we get to see this two heroes be for each other and then at the very end when the choice of either be for the humans or for the mutants started the now called X-MEN. <br/><br/>Casting, in this movie is just the thing that gives this movie the edge it needed, as Kevin Beacon (long time no see) was just wonderful, giving us a memorable performance. The other teens in the movie, Havoc, Darwin etc also did their part as we see them struggle with their mastery of their powers.<br/><br/>So in the end of this review, marvel did something a lot better than what the last 2 films had done.

They did a marvelous job in their portrayals. From the beginning of the film until the infusion the Cuban Missile Crisis, the plot is unbelievable. Coupled with great action sequences and humor, I find myself on the edge of my seat. Yet, the perplexing decision to use the Cuban Missile Crisis to cause the fissure between Fassbender and McAvoy is as confusing as why a naked Rebecca Romijn...what's the second part of her last name now? shows up in the middle of the film. That being said, the one liner from Hugh Jackman had me laughing for a good five minutes in an only Hugh Jackman sort of way. The film had depth and a decent amount of character development from its two male leads. With the title being ""First Class"" I expected more development of the characters expected to be in class. As far as prequels go this film far outshines the Star Wars prequels and gives the audience an entertaining and fun ride with an attractive cast(hmmmm Jennifer Lawrence...enough said!).

The Wolverine prequel actually had more soul.I also thought that Xaviar and Mystique were terribly miscast; not that there performances were off; I just didn't see in them young Patrick Stewart or Rebecca Romijn. But film companies are so reluctant against going with unknowns.<br/><br/>Then there are the discrepancies: in X-Men 1 and 2, Xaviar describes Magneto as an old friend, but in this prequel, they barely knew each other. Nor in those first two films did Mystique even seem to know Xaviar, when here she apparently spent two decades with him growing up. And while plot holes abound, a decent rewrite of the script could have solved most of them. But apparently, the script went through three rewrites, which is in and of itself a bad sign.<br/><br/>Worst line in the film: towards the end, Xaviar says something like, ""What worse can happen? I'll probably become bald."" The writers probably could have gotten more laughs from him saying ""Beam me up,"" but the film takes place two years prior to Star Trek being aired.<br/><br/>As far as comic books to films go, it was all right.

One of the two main reasons for this prowess is probably the absence of pretense and pure demonstration of primal machismo and showing off: that is to say the absence of Wolverine (he appears in a cameo actually). But the first of those reasons is obviously the presence of wits, class, a sense of drama credibility: German performer Michael Fassbender, already seen in Inglourious Basterds, is the great provider for all that as Magneto, real profundity, sheer rage, multilinguality This prequel purposely almost looks like a (good) James Bond film on the bases of revenge, Cold War, female manipulations and colorful credits at the end.

"iReviewFilms","7","0","2","7 June 2011"," Fanaticalaboutfilms Review: X-Men: First Class
","One problem that every prequel has to overcome it the ability to keep interest despite us knowing the eventual outcome of the movie. If you have seen any of the previous four films then it's quite probable you can piece together how this movie is going to end and how the characters are going to turn out. This therefore needs to be compensated for and is done so successfully by the introduction of plenty of new characters to keep our interest and the actual discovery of how two men who used to be friends come to be enemies.<br/><br/>X-Men: First Class follows the exploits of the first mutants to be discovered, primarily that of Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and Erik Lehnsherr aka Magneto (Michael Fassbender). It begins with a 12 year old Charles meeting Raven (Jennifer Lawrence) and their friendship as they grow up and a young Erik undergoing the hardship of Nazi Germany and the anger that this instils in him. Moving forward, Charles graduates from Oxford with his PhD in genetic mutation and is brought into the US government to help with a mission to locate someone whereas Erik is hunting down the man responsible for separating him from his mother during the regime twenty years earlier.<br/><br/>Both of their paths then cross when we discover they are after the same man, Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) and the mutant henchmen that he has surrounded himself with. Erik and Charles team up to recruit new mutants to teach them to use their mutations in order to prevent the Cuban missile crisis from unleashing the next World War and bring Shaw to justice.<br/><br/>The two main plots of this movie are based on finding out about the relationship between Charles and Erik and the actual storyline tied into the Cuban missile crisis and an impending world war. The trailers emphasised that this was the film where we could witness the beginning of the X-men and it doesn't fail to deliver with a good script not only providing the answers but achieving them with a well crafted dialogue.<br/><br/>As with most of the action movies nowadays, the action sequences are both impressive and well shot using a multitude of CGI effects especially during the final scene which was a particular highlight. The acting was also first class (poor pun intended) with McAvoy and Fassbender leading the way, their characters playing off each other perfectly but by no means outshining the rest of the cast.<br/><br/>Placing the whole film during that of the Cold War was a great choice by director Matthew Vaughn and co as it provided not only an impressive backdrop but used these historical events to enforce its points. In fact Vaughn impresses once more leading to a film that makes you invest in the characters before building to a action packed end.<br/><br/>In comparison to it's Summer sequel/prequel compatriots it has certainly taken the lead as the best so far and in terms of where it sits with the other 4 X-Men movies, well I'd put it in the top 2. Worth a trip to the cinema? Definitely, especially if you were already a fan of the franchise.<br/><br/>For further reviews feel free to check out: http://www.fanaticalaboutfilms.com"

","By itself, this movie does it's job. However, if you start considering the other x-men movies, this movie starts to fall short. There are several scenes and events in this movie that do not match up to suggested or explicitly mentioned in the other movies. To be fair, some of these events could be temporary, and further x-men origins style movies could resolve many of these inconsistencies. But.. the movie does well on it's own and doesn't really need the others to explain it. Which makes sense since it is a prequel of sorts.<br/><br/>In the x-men mythology, professor X and magneto were supposed to originally be friends. But this really is not explored well in the movie at all. The bulk of the movie takes place in such a short time frame, the characters just don't seem to build that connection or friendship. They seem friendly, but not close friends as suggested by the mythology. Towards the end there are a few events that are supposed to build off of the strong bond implied by the movie, but again, it just doesn't work because the movie didn't build that strong friendship. If you are familiar with the general story, there are expected reactions, but anyone unfamiliar is likely to wonder why they are acting so out of character.<br/><br/>Magneto's and Professor X's personalities are explored a little bit and generally do a good job. Not as well I think with Magneto. You sort of see him switch his a couple of times in the movie and it does leave you with this weird out of place feeling. I think that is a big part of the reason why the movie fails at building the friendship between the two characters.<br/><br/>If you are a hardcore x-men fan, I think you will be left with some disappointment. But if you go with an open mind and don't look at it so seriously, it is a fun and entertaining film worth watching. There are many x-men classic characters that have appearances, which are always fun to see. One of X-Mens' themes is diversity, and this movie is no exception.

","I admire the director, the actors (not only very beautiful, but also talented)and the whole movie. Very clever.<br/><br/>Only thing that really sucked where the German scenes. Use German actors! What was supposed to be German, sounded a lot more like Russian or so. No wonder everyone thinks German's a harsh language. People of my generation, often watch movies in original language. Also it gets old having German and Russian characters as the evil one's. Call them Nazis, not Germans. If someone would make a movie about the American south, you'd feel insulted too, if he'd say Americans instead of KKK-members. A movie that costs 160 millions could spent at least a little more interest on the second biggest market for Hollywood films!"
"The_Film_Cricket","Null","0","6","6 June 2011"," X-Men goes back to the beginning and STILL suffers from overpopulation.
","The basic fundamental problem with all of the X-Men movies has been an issue of crowd control. The X-Men employs a gallery of characters so large that a two and half-hour movie isn't enough time to get to know everyone and still have a serviceable action picture. What comes of these movies is a bit of deep drama involving the forward characters while those in the background are left with little dimension beyond their special powers. I guess that's to be expected, audiences go to these movies for action scenes, not a character study.<br/><br/>'X-Men: First Class', the fifth film in this series, suffers from that problem just like the previous installments. The one has the novelty of being a prequel, so we can focus on the two men who will be the arch-enemy elders from the other films, Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and Erik Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbinder) - Professor X and Magneto respectively - and see how they met and how they became divided.<br/><br/>They have an interesting relationship. The film takes place mostly in 1962 as these two god-like figures meet under the threat that mutant beings are not easily accepted by normal humans, especially to the United States military. That doesn't give our government very much comfort, seeing as how they are busy with tensions with the Soviet Union over the possibility of nuclear war. Personally, I think that the mutant's story might have fit better into the struggle for civil rights, but never mind.<br/><br/>Charles, whose power is telepathy and mind control, wants to make a pact with the humans, and establish a government-funded school to train mutants in the best use of their abilities. Erik, whose power is manipulation of metal, wants to wage war against normal humans. His motivation is a little stronger because, as a boy, he was a holocaust survivor who saw his mother murdered before his eyes by an evil Nazi named Shaw (Kevin Bacon). Shaw wanted to force to boy to demonstrate his powers so they could be use in experiments. Years later, the grown-up Erik has become a one-man Nazi hunter, tracking Shaw's hidden contacts until he gets to the man himself. In his pursuit of vengeance, he catches the attention of Charles Xavier.<br/><br/>Before Charles and Erik split over ideals, the two are friends who team up to round up a group of mutant kids who are spread throughout the country. They find a clever collection of kids: Raven (Jennifer Lawrence), known as Mystique, can shape-shift; Angel Salvadore (Zoe Kravitz, daughter of Lenny Kravitz and Lisa Bonet) can sprout wings and spit fireballs; Hank McCoy, known as Beast, can hang upside down by his deformed feet; Sean Cassidy, known as Banshee, can shatter glass with his voice. And so on.<br/><br/>All of these abilities are fun to watch, but the characters don't have time to build. They are introduced, present their abilities, give themselves nicknames and then get their moment in the action scenes. They aren't really developed at all, just dropped in to join the fight. The novelty of the prequel helps us understand the basic relationships of characters that we already know: Charles, Erik, Mystique - but it takes no time to get to know anyone new.<br/><br/>The best thing about the movie are the performances by James McAvoy, Michael Fassbinder and Kevin Bacon. I especially liked McAvoy who plays Charles much the same way that Patrick Stewart previously did, as a caring individual who is smart and infectiously charming. I did feel a little bad for McAvoy, because playing a character who can read minds means that he has to spend many scenes with his index finger pressed against his right temple. Fassbinde, who plays Erik is a hunky actor who brings a certain level of crazed intensity to his performance. And Kevin Bacon, one of the best actors of his generation, is very good as a slimy villain here. He's all evil, all the time and he's very good.<br/><br/>I give 'X-Men: First Class' credit for trying something new. I was impressed by the way that the movie tied into The Cuban Missile Crisis and I liked its use of the early 60s as its template. There wasn't an immediate need for the film to be a prequel but I liked the fact that the studio wanted to try something new. It isn't any better or worse than any of the films that have come before. My reservation is that the movie, even in prequel form, plays much the same way that the first three films did. It delves into the issue of whether the mutants should befriend humans or wage war against them. It is an interesting conundrum but, you know, having dealt with that question in three previous movies I think I'm ready now for a movie that can answer that.<br/><br/>Rating: *** (of four)"

","The graphics were great, magneto was great, Kevin Bacon was amazing as usual. But the movie was bad in my taste. I was really hoping the storyline would be good. The guy that played Xavier( forgot his name) was horrible to be a young Xavier. Beast looked like a fluffy smurf mixed with a thunder cat on steroids. I wish they would have given the characters more time to show of their skills too. The directors and or writers focused to much on making the movie kid friendly. This is why its important to stick to the original story line as much as possible or do a great job at making a alternate version like the people did in Star trek. I hope that if they make another X-men film they focus more on giving the main characters stronger parts as well as powers."

","The movie it self was good. I love the girl they have playing Frost. They could have giving her diamond shield a bit more credit! My big complaint is great story line had already been written, why did they change the first class line up. I would have loved to have seen a young Scott,Jean-grey, a male angle. I think they did a good job with Beast. That Angle chick annoyed the crap out of me. She looked more like a fairy. It's just sad to see a franchise ruined. I know the makers response will be, well people would get tired of seeing the same charters in each movie...I say...has anyone got tired of Superman yet? It still makes money right? Kids today will never know just how cool the X-men really were. Somebody put a lot of work into creating those charters, only to see them falsely immortalized. The only person this franchise got right was Wolverine (personality wise). I like the liberties they took giving Mystic common teenage issues. My 7 out of 10 comes completely from creativity. It kept with the spirit of Xmen but not the truth. And you can never go wrong with Kevin Bacon."

","X-Men prequel/origin tale chronicles the early days of Charles Xavier (McAvoy) and Erik Lehnsherr (Fassbender) when they were two young men discovering their powers and working together for the good of all mutants. In the early 1960s, they select gifted mutants from all over the world and help them harness their powers in hopes that they can help combat a sinister megalomaniac who's bent on starting World War III. Undermined by needless, underdeveloped supporting characters, and unavoidably predictable story elements, but made worthwhile by efficient action scenes, good special effects, and effective casting in key roles.

","1. I find it odd that the young Eric Lensherr did not attempt to kill Klaus Smidt at all after the latter shot his mother (Eric killed practically everyone else in the room in a fit of rage). He even allowed Klaus Smidt to give a reassuring pat on his shoulders.<br/><br/>2. Conti issue: The metal cabinet in Klaus Smidt's office that was crushed earlier became whole again after little Eric Lensherr went berserk. <br/><br/>3. Emma Frost should be able to detect the presence of Moira Mactarget when the latter made an accidental excursion into the hidden chamber of Hellfire's Inner Circle.<br/><br/>4. Moira has always been a scientist stationed in Muir Island. I find it weird that she is portrayed as a CIA covert agent here.<br/><br/>5. Diamond is harder than steel. Magneto should not be able to injure Emma's neck in her diamond form.<br/><br/>6. Actually, Professor X should be able to read Emma's mind when she is in her diamond form. In that form, Emma doesn't have telepathy to protect her thoughts (As long as she has a thought in her head, Professor X can read it - a concrete wall or diamond barrier is no obstacle to a telepath).<br/><br/>7. Did they detain Emma Frost in a CIA holding cell? With her powers - mental manipulation skills and all, she could have broken out easily. She even 'scratched' away a piece of glass in the holding to show how easily she could have escaped. Why didn't she? Why didn't Azazel teleport her away? And she has to wait for someone to come rescue her? It doesn't make sense, a powerful girl like that. And she missed all the action at the beach...sigh!<br/><br/>Believe it or not, the fans are okay that you took creative licence with your storyline - that's fine because Marvel couldn't keep their stories straight in their comics anyway.<br/><br/>I wish you had written the Black Queen into the storyline though. Make her black if you have to, we don't care because she's a very interesting character!<br/><br/>Here's what I think you'll do for the next 'episode'.<br/><br/>1. Mystique and Azazel have an affair and Nightcrawler is born! 2. Moira and Charles got together and they have a reality-warping mutant son. 3. The Black Queen makes her appearance and gives Emma Frost (The White Queen a hard time). 4. I like the 60's set up for this movie but maybe the next episode should be in the 70's (God! The disco music, flared bell-bottom pants, platform shoes, gaudy set-up, Richard Nixon, The Cold War, Vietnam war, space programme]. Hellfire Club in the 70's will be even more decadent! 5.

","Now i know everyone is very excited and mostly happy with the new prequel of the x-men franchise. But i guess i will have to disagree with the general audience. I've just watched this most anticipated prequel of this summer and i've to say while the movie was not bad, it did not live up to the hype. <br/><br/>Before going into the negatives i should say X-Men: First Class had an amazing story and equally well crafted dialog so Kudos to Bryan Singer. Actores are well casted and they all delivered. Especially Michael Fassbender as Magneto was unbelievable. This time we get to see Magneto not as a homicidal sociopath but a vulnerable and emotional human being. So even when he turns on the human race and goes on a killing fringe, still we feel sorry for him. Michael Fassbender took this daunting task and pulled it off with near perfection. James McAvoy as Professor X was incredible as well. Since it got to be hard for the audience to relate with someone who has every thing handed to him, McAvoy have done a wonderful job making the audience fall in love with him. Other actors did not get much screen time and had so little to work with so its not their fault that we don't feel much for them. but among them Jennifer Lawrence was the exception. Her portration of Mystique will change your whole perception of that character. The visual effects and cinematography were state of art. Especially that awesome scene that was seen in the trailer where Magneto lifts that submarine into the air or when he stops hundreds missile with a flick of hand was just breath taking to watch in the big screen.<br/><br/>So, why do i think this movie is not worthy of all these praise? The problem is with direction i guess. when you see the movie you will feel like it is skipping some parts and abruptly jumping from one scene to another. The storytelling was not smooth at all. There was virtually no character development. It was like they assumed everyone knows Professor X is a huge humanitarian and Magneto is a victim of his inner demon so we don't have to waste time to build this characters. And while it was a delight to see the bromance between Eric and Charls, it was also done poorly. It was like one moment Charls and Eric just met in the middle of the sea and in the next scene they are BFF. the gradual development of a strong friendship despite mammoth difference in their perception and end-goal was absent. the film felt rushed and bumpy. The makers were in such a hurry to reach to the final climax that they lost sight of the little things that actually makes a film unforgettable.<br/><br/>So, in the end X-Men: First Class is not as good as X-Men or X2 United was and it had so much possibility and room for being a great film which it was not. But it is still so much better that X-Men: Last Stand and Wolverine and still worth your money and time."

","I must admit, i am not a big fan of X-men, I never read the comics nor did i watch the old cartoons when i was a kid. I have always been a Batman fan. Even the first X-men movies i watched, i enjoyed but never turned into a hard core fan. But all that might change because of this movie, it is pretty good and all those other reviewers are spot on about how good this movie is.<br/><br/>first of, the story and writing is top notch, the script is very good, unlike most comic book movies where the scripts are not usually executed right. and it is done with style, loved the whole Bond-esque feel to it, at times i felt like watching a James Bond movie with Mutants, a lot of Spy like elements and Villains wanting to destroy the world.<br/><br/>Then comes the Cast, i must say one of the best group of actors picked in a movie, especially Michael Fassbender as Magneto and James Mcavoy as Professor X, both carried the movie and shined. Also, Rose Byrne was good here :) speaking of Bond, i believe Michael Fassbender would be perfect as the next James Bond !!<br/><br/>the other younger actors were good too but overshadowed with the two main leads.<br/><br/>Action was solid, and special effects were stunning, also sound effects were amazing and in certain scenes the whole theater was shaking. the movie however fell just short from being perfect because of the smaller characters and mutants, their mutations were a bit ridiculous for me. but that is just me ..<br/><br/>In short, a very good movie, professionally written with a great script, wonderful cast and executed with style. very entertaining. go watch it."
"Fields201","7","0","3","5 June 2011"," X-Men Unite!
","After the abomination of X-Men Origins: Wolverine (and I love Hugh Jackman and the Wolverine character), I must say I wasn't excited for another X-Men movie. However, the trailers were pretty decent and it was enough to spark my interest in seeing it. Did they make up for the awful Origins movie?<br/><br/>Yes. Yes they did. With the absence of Wolverine (with a small cameo, at least) I wasn't sure what to expect. But man, there is so much to like! The film begins with Xavier and Magneto as kids. It only lasts for a good ten minutes, but I would be happy if the whole film centered around these two kids. Magneto was separated from his mother from Nazis, and is confronted by an evil Kevin Bacon with a German accent. Kevin Bacon wants Magneto to move a coin, much like he did with the gate to get to his mother. However, Magneto couldn't so Kevin Bacon shoots his mother. Magneto goes crazy and suddenly the whole room starts moving and crushing and Kevin Bacon just laughs. Meanwhile, Xavier befriends a shape shifting girl in his home named Raven (later changing her name to Mystique), and thus we see the opening title.<br/><br/>Then it flash forward to when they are adults. At first, I wanted to film to center around those kids but the adults did their parts well. I think I speak for most people when I say that Xavier and Magneto's relationship is the heart of the story. However, it never really felt as strong to me as I liked it to be. Call me cynical. But I was very impressed with James McAvoy's performance as Xavier. He could hold a candle to Patrick Stewart any day. Seriously, he carried the film well and I grew to like him more and more as the film went on. I particularly liked the relationship between him and Mystique. She's so gorgeous, that I was hoping he would at least kiss her at some point.<br/><br/>There are, of course, other mutants in the group, but the only one with meaningful powers belongs to Havok (Lucas Till) who seems to be the only one who has powers that could actually help them. The others can either cling to things, run fast, adapt to environments, or fly and make sonar noises. They just didn't seem like they could be a match for the evil Kevin Bacon and his group of goons. These guys just look like they could rip through this team like tin foil and hardly believable that they could stand a chance. But hey, at least it helps with the suspense factor.<br/><br/>I did wish that they chose a different ending and just save that one for a sequel or something. I don't want to give too much away but like Origins, they keep ruining the continuity of the series. If you watch these films in order, it just doesn't link up. However, as a stand alone movie to the franchise, it was done exceptionally well. I have renewed faith in the X-Men franchise, and I can't wait to see what happens in the Second Class."
"KroneofThorns","7","0","3","5 June 2011"," A Debate:
","Who in the HELL paid all these decent critics to review X-Men?<br/><br/>Alex: I've hated every X-Men movie so far, so I'm definitely not surprised if this one is terrible too.<br/><br/>Max: Let me clear this up though. Fassbender and McAvoy were great together. However their relationship couldn't save this trainwreck.<br/><br/>Thomas: I think the praise is higher because of the audience putting up with X3 and Wolverine, two pieces of sh*t. So it was way better then what was expected, plus the trailer made it seem just OK and the movie was better then the trailer made it seem as well. There were plenty of story issues that I had but as a movie itself, it was good.<br/><br/>Daniel Krone: I have my problems with the film, but they have nothing to do with the source material because sitting down to watch the film I threw all that completely out the window. I knew they were just going to take characters from the comics and do with them what they pleased. I accepted that they were trying to create their own mythology. The things that bothered me where the things that they put in the movie that probably shouldn't have been in their, and the blatant tone issues. Some scenes (Magneto killing those guys) and (the children drinking and showing off) seemed like they were from 2 different films entirely.<br/><br/>Max: The story bore the hell out of me, it was laughable at times. There was not one memorable joke / line / scene in the film. It wasn't dark enough. January Jones is just plain terrible. Every single shot of CG took me out of the film completely. Jennifer Lawrence ruined Mystic, she was a terrible choice. Her relationship with Beast was so forced and useless. There's some great themes that they had to play with that they just threw out the window. Fassbender and McAvoy didn't belong in the movie, they were 1000% above everyone in every aspect. Matthew Vaughn wasn't a great choice for this. The training montage was... eh. What were they doing? The story structure was all over the place, I couldn't tell where on act started and the other began. It was just a string of crap happening.<br/><br/>Max: The biggest problem for me? The X-men (comic) were created so people could connect with them. They are different. The have problems. They're like you and me so we should immediately connect with them... but in this... abosutley not. The scenes when the ""first class"" was just hanging out, drinking soda, naming each other? Come on. That was a pivotal moment in who Banshee, Mystic, Beast, Darwin, etc are... But they blew it right there.<br/><br/>Daniel Krone Wasn't dark enough ? What movie did you hope this was going to be. Ever since 'The Dark Knight' people have been complaining that comic films aren't dark enough. Spiderman 2 isn't a murder fest. It's fun and strikes the right tone. Spiderman 2 was less dark than this. (Yeah the visual effects looked 10 years old) and emotions, you mean outside of Fassbender and McAvoy and you said previously they were the only good parts of the film. Matthew Vaughn I think was a right choice. I only think the films lopsided because producers and other people were interfering with what he could have made this film out to be. I agree the structure was horrible. Editing was poor. There were maybe 3 great scenes (And yes I think great, that ending was amazing. And I agree kind of silly but it's a comic book film so I don't mind ridiculous submarines.) And yes they spent too much teasing the audience with great themes than using them. I guess I liked it because I saw what great potential the film had and of course the 3 good performances. Bacon, Fassbender, & McAvoy. They were leagues above the other actors in talent. And the rest of the film should have taken the kind of care they took with there performances. But I expected far less and got slightly more than the last films had given me. It wasn't epic, it should have been. (And that one scene was horrible because it was poorly written and I bet rushed in the shooting so the actors seemed forced. That scene was one notch away from being the right tone, and you're right. The direction of that scene blew it...thank god bacon showed up and killed some people.) It's not a great movie, but maybe for me it's a guilty pleasure.<br/><br/>Daniel Krone: I saw an interview with Bryan Singer where he said he wanted to pander to the fans (in so many words it wasn't that blatant) and I have a feeling why sequences, and other things felt really out of place is too many of the writers and producers trying to get their own visions in. And Matt Vaughn not stepping up the the plate and saying...hey this is my damn movie let me do it. That's how I feel. He was too blinded by the fact that he was directing a large important property that he lost sight of what was going to make this franchise important. <br/><br/>Daniel Krone: But I still think ""Batman Begins"" has a lot of ridiculous flaws. So hopefully the next time around the producers shut up and let Matt Vaughn get a clear, focused (key words) vision down and perhaps we could indeed have a great second follow up."
"AndytheDirector","9","0","2","5 June 2011"," A Queer Theory Bonanza!
","X-Men itself has always, in the best of times, been the best superhero comic books for analysis by academic critique. The issues of diversity and civil rights movements inspired Marvel Comics artists to transform the monthly adventures of our favorite mutants into an analogy about liberation movements in the USA, with Charles Xavier as Martin Luther King Jr. and Eric Lensherr as Malcolm X. Here they nail the analogy better than before, with Charles acting as quite the ladies man (not unlike the flirtatious Dr. King) while Eric is a radicalized and angry to the point of violence (not exactly Malcolm X in execution, but certainly in principle). This itself makes the film an important piece for analysis in the academy. The 'Mutant and Proud' slogan echoed throughout the film is clearly a pun on old gay rights slogans, with the analogy of hiding an identity in plain sight equally powerful."

","I have always been a massive fan of marvel. Ever since I was a kid, I've loved the entire world I was able to escape to. I was never a massive fan of the spider-man movies as a kid (except spider-man 2), because they felt untrue to the comics. However, X-men has always had exactly the same feel as the comic books did. The order the films were made in was the order of my favourites (1,2, last stand, wolverine.) But my favourite part of the entire X-men universe was Magneto and Professor X's rivalry. So naturally I was very excited but slightly anxious, hoping it wouldn't fallow the deterioration of the rest of the franchise. Well, luckily it didn't.<br/><br/>First of all, Michael Fassbender and James McAvoy are absolutely brilliant. Their scenes together were almost as exciting as Robert De Niro and Al Pacino in HEAT. I've always loved the idea that arch-enemies can be trying to destroy each other, and then the next minute be sat civilised over a dinner. Like political leaders.I loved Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen performances, but who's was better. That is debatable. The rest of the cast give a fairly good to very good range of performances, but the film does really centre around Charles and Erik, so that doesn't effect it too much.<br/><br/>The opening plays out like an Oscar winning film. There is so much Drama, emotion, and contrast. I'm not sure if Kevin Baker played the younger Shaw at the beginning, but if he did, he was excellent. It would also be the highlight of the movie for him if he did. It reminded me a lot of Christoph Waltz in Inglourious Basterds. His performance did get slightly weaker as the film progressed though.<br/><br/>The script is amazing. Very funny, witty and not afraid to laugh at itself. There are lots of 'Tips of the hat' to the earlier films, referencing characters and specific situations. It reminded me slightly of how Red Dragon 'tipped it's hat' to Silence Of The Lambs at the end.<br/><br/>My only picky moans are that every so often, you hear the slightest hint of Fassbender's Irish accent, which does sometimes draw away from the realism of the film. Also, I really did have to say 'Yeah, okay.' about Kevin Baker's character coming back and secretly being a mutant all along. <br/><br/>But, all in all very good. 7.5 (imdb wouldn't let me put that half.)<br/><br/>Favourite scene: Hugh Jackman's cameo."

","I will start off by saying i am not a fan-boy of X-Men particularly. I never read the comics or anything and saw the original trilogy which i thought was pretty average. <br/><br/>However when i saw the Wolverine movie a few years ago i was very impressed and this film has continued to impress me. From what i remember of the original trilogy it manages to avoid conflicting with it and in fact explains much of what is behind the behaviour of each character similar to the way Wolverine did. It allows the viewer to relate to both of the main characters in their parallel stories and sympathize with their conflicting ideals which gradually become more intense and build up to an unforgettable climax. I won't go into detail of the story as there is not much more to explain without giving away plot points.<br/><br/>I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a good, watchable action film and enjoys feeling attached to the characters and the story. Therefore in my opinion it is thoroughly entertaining as a standalone film. Id recommend checking other reviews if you are a loyal X-Men fan."

","I have to be honest and say when I first heard that they were doing an X-Men prequel, I was quite sceptical as we have seen other movie prequels that were pretty dire (a certain trilogy springs to mind), but I need not have worried as they certainly pulled it off.<br/><br/>For people like me who are fans of Marvel and been following X-Men for years there were perhaps some niggly points but I had to just push them aside and accept the fact that the X movies are set in their own continuity.<br/><br/>James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender made the roles their own, with the odd nod to Patrick Stewart and Sir Ian McKellin. The rest of cast managed to hold their own too.<br/><br/>The storyline itself was good but had a couple of plot holes. <br/><br/>For me my favourite part of the movie was a rather memorable (and colourful) cameo, which certainly got the biggest laugh from the rest of the audience too.<br/><br/>From what I have if this movie does well they will make another, they have no worries there for me it looks like it will do well this summer, but for me still cannot beat Thor for summer blockbuster title."

Casting especially Kevin Bacon was spot on for Sebastian Shaw, the storyline was dramatic and non-stop action. I can't applaud enough for the script writers. Each character was brought on to life from the comics and well acted. I like how the characters are developed from young until how they become. There is even a History Lesson. Even the villains were recognizable, and at a certain perception the audience will get a feel of how they feel. Don't expect storyline and plots to be taken right out of the X-Men comics.

","X Men: First Class is a great movie. The only way you won't like the movie is if your a die hard fan of the series. If so, you'll pull out things like how some of the origins of things don't match up with the comic book. Such as Erik stealing his helmet from Shaw when in the comic, it is revealed that Erik helped Charles make it. However, if your a moderate fan of the series like I am, you'll be very impressed. For the afore mentioned moderate fans, there are comedic elements in the film that make the experience all the more enjoyable. This includes references to the first films such as the appearance of Logan. What he said was funny, and I won't say since I don't know if you can curse in these reviews. In some weird way, I felt special that I got the small jokes in it.

","this is a prequel to xmen telling how Charles Xavier became professor x, how Erik became magneto, and how everything came to the way they were in xmen. it was OK. the story is that when Erik was a child during the holocaust, and a general (kevin bacon) who is also a mutant wants Erik to be with him and to use Erik to his advantage. Bacon's character says to control a metal coin and if he doesn't succeed he would shoot his mother. Erik did not succeed and his mother was shot right in front of him by Sebastian shaw (kevin bacon). however Charles is in a totally different situation. he is wealthy and taken care of. but at the same time Erik was a kid Charles was in house sleeping, and he heard a noise. he went downstairs and it was mystique pretending to be his mother. he knew that by reading her mind, and took her in, taking care of her. here we are 22 years later and Erik is looking for shaw. while Charles has just become a professor to discuss there are more mutants out in the world, and is recruited by the CIA to find shaw, because Shawn may start world war 3. Charles saves Erik and thats how there friendship begins. they recruit other mutants and what was really cool was that they went into a bar the two of them to recruit another mutant, and guess who it was. Logan aka wolverine. Hugh Jackman was there playing him. he was in it for maybe a minute., but once the crowd saw his face they clapped and laughed. the scene was Erik and Charles walking into a bar seeing Logan. Charles said how are you. and Logan said go f*** yourself, and that was his scene. everyone laughed. anyway Charles and Erik recruit a team, and while there finding more mutants. the field base where the few mutants are is attacked by shaw and his mutant team. so Charles finds a place to train mutants. which is the school for mutants for the other xmen movies. at the end Erik and Charles goes there separate ways as you might of guessed and Charles opens the school for mutants, while Erik goes to make a team of mutants to start the extinction of the human race. this movie was pretty good. a lot better than i thought it would be. it got off to a slow start and was a little to long, but other than that a great movie, with great action and a great cast. see it."

","This film was genuinely sensational. It answered many questions left open in the previous x-men films whilst retaining its own unique storyline that left you wanting to watch the whole film again. Usually one would assume a film this far along in this franchise would be bad.. what else could they do? Think again.This film was fresh and made even non x-men lovers in awe. The film is always on the move, action mixed with humour and romance and the actors aren't bad to look at either! AS a personal fan of James Mcavoy i think this film keeps his charming English stature whilst adding a new intellectual spin. I thoroughly recommend this film to all and hope to see another x-men film in the cinema soon!"

","This latest installment in the X-Men franchise—technically a prequel, another ""origins"" story—features lots of action and thrills. Not only is it a worthy addition to the series, but it also manages to transcend many of the clichés that often hamper prequels. Many directors of prequels try to cut corners, assuming that the audience already knows the characters and just wants another story featuring those familiar characters. And although we do know most of the major players in this film—well, if you've seen the original X-Men films, you know them—we don't know how their relationships started and how the dynamics among them developed. ""X-Men: First Class"" is a genuine comic book action adventure film—and, considering that it's over two hours long, it moves at a very brisk pace—but it's also the story of how a community of ""others"" began, how they developed their identities, how they related to each other, and how they ultimately became divided into the opposing factions we've come to know. If you detect sociocultural metaphors within the story, that's all well and good, but the director is not interested in conveying some profound cultural message here. He's interested in making a fun-filled action movie, and he succeeds very impressively. The performances are top-notch, especially Michael Fassbender as the young Magneto and the always-solid James McAvoy as the young Charles Xavier. And be on the lookout for Hugh Jackman's brief but highly amusing cameo as Wolverine."

","Evil mutant Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) plots to start World War III. He is ably assisted by bad girl mutant Emma Frost (January Jones). He is resisted by good mutant Charles Xavier (James McAvoy)—the future Professor X—and ambivalent mutant Erik Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender)— the future Magneto.<br/><br/>This prequel to the X-Men franchise has a groovy, Sixties James Bond/Mad Men feel. There are go-go dancers, miniskirts, and the Cuban Missile Crisis. JFK, Khrushchev, and SPOILER ALERT a certain adamantium-clawed mutant all make cameo appearances. But at the center is fan favorite Mystique's (Jennifer Lawrence) contemporary struggle to accept her mutant identity. You can almost hear Lady Gaga singing ""Born This Way"" on the soundtrack. <br/><br/>Director Matthew Vaughn does a good job keeping the action moving, but with all this plot—not to mention six different writers—some of the character development gets lost. We barely get to know one mutant before he's killed off. Still, overall, this is a successful reboot, and the fanboy in me is looking forward to a sequel. Sentinels, anyone?"

Director Matthew Vaughn (once previously slated to helm a chapter of the series) balances the fantastic visual effects set pieces (i.e. Magneto lifting a submarine out of the ocean) and allows his young cast of gifted actors (the aforementioned protagonists and Lawrence too as Mystique) to bring some depth with an undercurrent of darkness much needed for the showcase of mutants being recruited to both sides of good and evil."

","Finally, we got to know how the whole thing started, why Magneto (played by Fassbender) and Xavier (played by McAvoy) had become who they are, in the later X-Men movies. Why Magneto dislike the human-race so much.<br/><br/>But as always, all is not as it seems, for one can't help but have sympathy for Magneto. He is neither good or bad at this point. Xavier is also in his younger days a firm believer in, that people are worth saving. Basically, you get a little better insight into who they are emotionally.<br/><br/>We meet new, but also some known old mutants, just in younger versions. We see how new alliances are being made and destroyed, how friendships starting to crumble into pieces.<br/><br/>X-Men First Class has its soft and quiet moments, but certainly also moments with action scenes. <br/><br/>It's excellent acting performances rendered by all parties in the X-Men First Class. Can't imagine that, other actors than Fassbender and McAvoy play a young Magneto and Xavier. Fassbender has that tough, but sensitive edge, while McAvoy has a sensitive, but rough edge, and that makes them so good in their respective roles as Magneto and Xavier. <br/><br/>It's one of the best X-Men movies to date, even though X-Men 1 to 3 and Wolverine is really good too. <br/><br/>Hoping for a sequel to X-Men First Class, still with Fassbender and McAvoy in the leading roles as Magneto & Xavier."
"Johnny_086","9","0","2","4 June 2011"," Best X-Men film ever made
","I always have been a huge fan of the X-Men franchise, mostly because of the main characters and feeling connected to Magneto and his feelings towards humanity, but after watching this new film, my opinion about the old X-Men films have changed. First Class tells the story of how Magneto and Professor X met, how they became enemies, how Magneto found his helmet and how Charles ended on a wheelchair. Watching this feels great but the adds of new characters and new stories is even better. You can't compare this to the old movies just because this one is too much better, you forget about Storm, Jean Grey and the others while watching this amazing and well explained story. Magneto is the star of this film and his amazing power and dramatic past, Charles Xavier is better than ever, the bad guy is Sebastian Shaw, a extremely powerful mutant made by an amazing Kevin Bacon doing what he does best...and if I have to choose a secondary character I have to name January Jones as Emma Frost, she's amazing and as cold as the Ice Queen. I really hope they make a new trilogy because once you end watching it, you just want more!<br/><br/>THE BEST: The ending is awesome, all characters especially Magneto, Professor X, Sebastian Shaw and Emma Frost.<br/><br/>THE WORST: Kinda disappointed in Mystique, she was better when she was more mysterious...<br/><br/>RATING: 9/10 !"
"Prichards12345","7","0","2","4 June 2011"," Largely X-ellent with a few weaknesses
","There was a time when sequels/prequels were subject to the law of diminishing returns, and while that's still often true, X-Men First Class is a genuinely fine film in it's own right. A little more violent than the earlier movies; it's also surprisingly funny - perhaps not so surprising when some of the behind-the-camera talents include Jane Goldman and Matthew Vaughn.<br/><br/>The film is largely set in 1962, the year Marvel Comics really came into their own after The Fantastic Four's debut in 61' - we do get a brief round up of Charles Xavier's and Eric Lenscher's life up to that point. I wasn't sure how I'd take to James McEvoy and Michael Fassbender taking on the roles played by Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan respectively; but they're both excellent, and I really liked Jennifer Lawrence's younger version of Mystique. In fact the whole cast do well, with Kevin Bacon heading up the villain list as Sebastian Shaw, planning World War III via the Cuban Missile Crisis to ensure mutant dominance. If this is a cliché so be it, but actually the film rather playfully echoes the 60s Bond movies, and the war room is straight out of Dr. Strangelove. January Jones' Emma Frost is almost like a Fem-bot from Austin Powers! <br/><br/>Inspite of the numerous special effects the film never loses the characters from being the central focus of things. One thing I did find annoying was the endless captions flashing up at a change of scene. I don't need ""Moscow, Russia"" to appear when the camera swoops over Red Square! This constant captioning does become annoying as things go on. There are some illogical inconsistencies - Mystique's joining Magneto at the end feels very forced, especially when you think of the predicament her best friend is in.<br/><br/>On the whole, though, this is a very good origin movie for The X-Men, superbly acted and presented. Great brief cameo from Hugh Jackman, too. No post credit sequence, I'm afraid."
"moviewizguy","7","0","3","3 June 2011"," Before he was Professor X, he was Charles. Before he was Magneto, he was Erik.
","X-Men: First Class, following the classic Marvel mythology, charts the epic beginning of the X-Men saga. Before Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr took the names Professor X and Magneto, they were two young men discovering their powers for the first time. Before they were archenemies, they were closest of friends, working together, with other Mutants (some familiar, some new), to stop the greatest threat the world has ever known. In the process, a rift between them opened, which began the eternal war between Magneto's Brotherhood and Professor X's X-Men. (20th Century Fox)<br/><br/>FIRST CLASS is a bit of a disappointing film. The end result is that of a ""meh"" because it's a step up from WOLVERINE and THE LAST STAND, which isn't saying much, but it's nowhere near as great as X2. With its potential, FIRST CLASS could have been so much better than it turned out to be. The main flaw of the film is that it tells an origin story which in itself makes the film less interesting to watch because we're only waiting to see inevitable consequences resulting in what we already saw in the first X-Men film. It's like STAR WARS 3. Sure, it's cool to see things connect to the trilogy, but we expected that in the first place.<br/><br/>Being an origin story also means we have to go through the process of learning each character all over again which means a huge chunk of the film would be devoted to exposition. This could be interesting, and parts of it are, including a touching romance that develops between Raven (Mystique) and Hank (Beast). The addition of newer characters should also make this less tedious than it should be, but, like the previous X-Men films, there are just too many characters to fully develop each of them. Even with a long running time of over two hours, most of them are left in the dust, including the villains and professor Xavier himself. Still, director Matthew Vaughn tries his best to balance the many characters in this film, although not fully succeeding.<br/><br/>Many people will argue that the other characters don't matter since it focuses more on the relationship between Charles (Professor X) and Erik (Magneto). Unfortunately, even that isn't as fully developed as we want it to be. The problem is that the relationship is portrayed so much better by the two older actors in the trilogy, played by Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart, that we yearn for them to appear on screen together again. There is, however, one scene in which I felt the emotional connection between these two characters, which involves a satellite, and it's a sweet but short scene. The film also hints on the themes that were explored in the trilogy, but that doesn't do much good because they are only touched upon and are more interesting when we see them play out in the trilogy.<br/><br/>Another thing they could have made more interesting or changed altogether was the story dealing with the missile crisis. It's simply not interesting or compelling to watch. Even the climax in which the story really comes into play is as exciting as watching a kids race. It had little to do with the mutants themselves and more to do with stopping a nuclear war and, because of that, I didn't find myself caring much. The main villain, played by Kevin Bacon, isn't all that memorable either. He's very 2 dimensional with a bland super power. Again, we yearn a time in which the villain was McKellen's Magneto, who's more complex and interesting than Bacon's character will ever be.<br/><br/>I must say that James McAvoy is miscasted as Charles Xavier. As stated earlier, he's not developed well in here and his role is mainly to help and find more mutants. There's not much for him to do than his character truly deserves. Michael Fassbender, on the other hand, plays a fierce and compelling Magneto, saying his lines with conviction and bringing great emotional weight to his character. Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique is another noteworthy name among the cast who brings a soft and sweet side to her character. I also liked Nicholas Hoult as Beast. Everyone else, including January Jones and Jason Flemyng (who's like a Nightcrawler 2.0), are pretty forgettable. Saying all of that, the film does include some great action scenes, for the few that are in here, with terrific special effects. The soundtrack by Henry Jackman should have been toned down quite a bit though.<br/><br/>With all the problems listed above, FIRST CLASS is not a bad film. It's just an incredibly flawed one with nostalgia that only reminds us of the better, older actors in the trilogy. However, there are some intelligent aspects from the script, and the film does offer a few shining and emotional moments that go far and beyond many superhero films before, including the lackluster THOR and the dumb INCREDIBLE HULK. Even if I sounded like I'm being hard on this film, I'm doing so on purpose because I can see the great that can come out of it. Overall, FIRST CLASS ends up being my second favorite in the series, even ahead the first film (which I thought was only decent) but behind X2. With all the set up in this prequel (much like X-MEN is to X2), I do believe that a FIRST CLASS PART II could make this prequel series reach its potential and hopefully not disappoint us with a FIRST CLASS PART III like THE LAST STAND did. 6.5/10"
"MLewis8","8","0","4","3 June 2011"," Good, but let's not get carried away . . .
","Overall, this was a good action film featuring characters I enjoyed and cared about with an adequate story. This movie is being overrated as giving The Dark Knight a run for its money, as being the movie of the year, movie of the decade ... seriously? First Class (FC) is no Dark Knight, no Batman Begins either. I honestly can't say right now whether I enjoyed Thor or X2 more than FC (I'll have to watch them over again before deciding that). One problem with this movie is that it is a prequel, rather than a reboot. The flaw in having a prequel is that you already know what is going to happen in the end like what is going to happen to Xavier, Magneto, Mystique, etc. Prequels also risk creating continuity errors, which there are when compared with the other X-Men films. They should have just made this a reboot rather than a prequel. With the franchise hitting the gutter with X-Men Origins: Wolverine, a re-imagining of how the X-Men and arch-nemesis began would have been appropriate. James McAvoy's performance as Xavier was great, but I found it odd that Xavier has hair throughout the entire movie. Also, it wasn't quite explained why Xavier chooses to use his powers in certain situations and not others. There are other plot holes too like when Shaw says you're either with us or against us, kills Darwin, but doesn't go after the other mutants that didn't choose to join him. Or with Shaw's powers, why does he need a nuclear war, why is he waiting 18 years to carry out this plot, why not just absorb energy from a nuclear reactor or power plant and just start destroying mankind himself? These aren't the only flaws and I'm not going to list all of them. I'll just conclude by saying, despite its imperfections, I enjoyed FC. It, like Thor, will probably make my Blu-Ray collection along with the other X-Men movies. Clearly it is better than Wolverine (which sucked, but that's a story for another day); yet it's no Dark Knight nor Oscar contender for best film either. As much as I loved Fassbender's Magneto, I didn't get a best supporting actor vibe from his performance."

","It is a clever move to bring a prequel to the successful x men series and i was skeptical if the movie would deliver a great film or a real hash of it would be made. X men first class is definitely a crowd pleaser as it is well paced with the development of Charles Xavier (Mcavoy)and Erik Lensherr (Fassbender)occurring simultaneously on screen using some clever editing. The story develops nicely and ties in together to explain all the questions; how Xavier gets wheelchair bound and how Erik becomes bitter. The action scenes are also entertaining with its use of CGI and special effects and Kevin Bacon plays well as cold, sinister Shaw.<br/><br/>However i thought the film would have more character development of all the x men as the recruitment of all of the characters seemed too quick paced like a heist montage scene.<br/><br/>I did enjoy the movie thoroughly and is up there with Nolans batman.

","X-men: First Class is a film that requires patience. The film has an almost laughably bad beginning, with a few giggles spread for the next hour, before a spectacular second half which saves this film and leaves you with many memorable moments. Yes, X-men: First Class is 'that' movie. The one you skip a large portion of it and then tell your friends how amazing it was. The first half all just in the back of your mind.<br/><br/>The film has a wonderful story, which is cheesy but shameless, and is all a tale of revenge. Character traits are very heavily held out, so development is a breeze. Unfortunately, none of them felt real. When holding such significant themes in (what is classed as) a mainstream film, this isn't a positive. One can make absurd characters realistic, but X-men hasn't achieved it. If it didn't want too, that'd be great. Unfortunately, the opposite is the truth.<br/><br/>Having said that, visually the film ranges from average to fantastic. The CGI work is mostly a work of art, enough to distract you from the occasional bad dialogue, but some of the make-up is looks dated, mostly in the character of Beast (who's awful lip-sync and comical aggression doesn't help). <br/><br/>Notably; I haven't seen the other X-men films, though I am aware of certain aspects due to pop-culture. Some of the fan service, such as the cameo's, is well done and enjoyable. The ending, is of course, predictable, however the journey (at least the second half of it) is entertaining enough and has a few twists and turns that it's not a matter of what will happen, just a matter of when, which will keep you on your toes. This is how a prequel should be handled.<br/><br/>The films pacing is very out of line, with some very important pieces flashing by, while filler is extensive and overly long. Over all though, filler is used sparingly, and most of the scenes hold significance to the story.<br/><br/>Having said all that, X-men first class is not the amazing film everyone was hoping for. It's worth seeing, definitely. A 6/10 is by no means bad, it just isn't ridiculously good. Yes, X-Men First Class is suffering from the unfortunate Split Personality disorder. Half of it's bad, and half of it's good. I, for one, will not be revisiting this film for a second viewing in the near future though. Maybe when it hits the $10 shelf, in a year, but no time prior.<br/><br/>Second Opinions (Ratings more tailored for your needs): - For X-men fanatics, an 8/10 - For those who want story, a lesser 5/10. (The story is good, it's just poorly executed for the most part). - For those who only care for action, 6/10. You could find much better!"

There are tons of stories to be told and this was just the beginning. Charles and Erik's relationship was ""strained"" from the beginning to say the least but at least we got to see why Erik(Magneto) was so stern when it came to humans and mutants and Kevin Bacon as Sebastian Shaw was phenomenal. As far as I'm concerned xmen will be a marvel movie that will take years and years to forget if anyone wants to actually forget but this prequel to the hit franchise will make even non-marvel fans want to watch"
