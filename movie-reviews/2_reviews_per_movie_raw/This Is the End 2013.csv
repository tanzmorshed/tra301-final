","Is this movie silly? Yes. Is it packed with toilet humor? Yes. Do you see the erect (and later, flaccid) penis of a monster? Yes. Is there an important take-home message you get from watching it? Absolutely not.
So why am I giving it 10 stars? Because it made me laugh uncontrollably.
Maybe I'm different but even cheap laughs are good laughs."

","I thoroughly enjoyed the film, though in retrospect, I am not sure if it is really a great film--there's not much to compare it to. One thing's for certain: this film is not ""just like"" any other film you could name. It is one of the funniest films I have seen in quite a while. And I am probably going to miss the Rapture as a result of my enjoyment.<br/><br/>The film has graphic sex talk and graphic violence. The dialog could hardly be any nastier. And of course, hardly more sacrilegious. However, despite all of that, the film is surprisingly good-natured.<br/><br/>This is not a film for children or for family viewing. Anyone who is squeamish or easily offended should stay away.<br/><br/>And don't automatically assume that anyone over 40 would not like this film. I'm over 60; I had a great time. So I saw it a second time, and loved it even more."
"blackismylove","1","517","904","27 June 2013"," THE END didn't come quick enough for me
","I don't want to waste time dragging down this review like the movie did, so I'll mention some key elements.<br/><br/>Most of the movie was ad lib, they've admitted it. These are not theater actors, they're film actors. They're not trained to be good at doing things ""off the cuff."" There WERE parts that were funny, but they were too few and far apart. The humor was sort of a slap in the face to my intelligence. I was more offended that I was expected to be entertained than I was the actual raunchy jokes. It was like a high school project with a really big budget.<br/><br/>Slap in the face #2. It was like watching a really long commercial. The characters actually fight over who gets to eat the milky way and describe why they love the product so much. Seriously? Aside from those things, there were a lot of little crappy plot devices that were way too forced. Why is Noah suddenly getting raped by Satan? Why does Franco's new multi million dollar concrete ""fortress"" home collapse within minutes catching fire, and why does it have a basement you can only access from outside? The overwhelming success of this movie in only its second week is proof that the standards of young movie goers is almost non existent. Better movies get drowned out because the industry is so over-saturated by crap like this, so in a sense, you can say that movies like this really are actually part of ""the end."""
"ohgoddammit","1","478","836","11 June 2013"," This movie was awful, self indulgent and funny maybe twice in two hours.
","This movie simply wasn't funny. It dragged on interminably, scenes with little comedic value got dragged out for far too long presumably because the directors (and main featured actors) were too high while making this steaming pile of wasted time.<br/><br/>We get it. You like to do drugs and are generally wastes of humanity and oxygen on this planet. This movie isn't funny though. There have been many funny drug movies made, and made by funny people on drugs. Super Troopers was funny, Cheech and Chong was funny, Half Baked was funny, this was not funny.<br/><br/>This movie is a nauseating bromantic drama pretending to be a comedy. I expected the two main characters to start making out at the end. Not that there would be anything intrinsically wrong with that, in fact it would've been cathartic since they so obviously were in love with each other.<br/><br/>The two funniest actors in the movie, Ansari and Cera, die within the first ten minutes and all you're left with is a weak cast and weaker script.<br/><br/>I want Seth Rogen to give me my money back, though the two wasted hours of my life are something no one can ever give back. Movies like this make me not want to see movies in theaters anymore, because had I known what I was going in for from trailers and the publicity, I never would have bothered seeing this train wreck.<br/><br/>I wish I could give this movie zero out of ten stars.<br/><br/>I guess some people really like this stuff, but I'll be avoiding Seth's movies like the plague in the future."

","I saw this movie opening weekend but did not review it right away because I was not sure of what I thought of it. It was not really what I was expecting. I was expecting a raunchy but light hearted comedy that took light of a bad situation but instead the apocalypse in this movie is taken very seriously. I was not so sure I liked that. But I've had over a week to think on it and I have decided that Overall I really enjoyed watching This is the End.<br/><br/>I love the cast I think everyone in this movie is talented and really funny. They all have such great chemistry together but also all have something of their own to offer. The funniest part of the movie for me and my friends I think was a several minute long back and forth between Danny Mcbride and James Franco but I would watch the movie again for that scene alone So overall This is the End is a really fun over the top movie. <br/><br/>I give This is the End an 8/10"
"Degeuss","7","132","223","4 November 2013"," Hilarious and original, which is all it was meant to be.
","Although 'This is the end' does not have the greatest storyline in the history of film, it is a very inventive movie in its own way. The fact that every actor and actress plays him or herself makes the movie quite original and refreshing. Besides that, there is also the fact that the makers took an overused theme, the end of the world, and made it completely their own.<br/><br/>'This is the end' hasn't failed a second to make me laugh. It is a very clever and entertaining comedy, with hilarious and dirty dialogues. I do have to admit, however, that the storyline can feel a little bit too ridiculous from time to time, even for this kind of movie. The acting in the movie was not that spectacular, but the actors involved were all born for this kind of movie.<br/><br/>For anyone who can truly appreciate a hilarious movie which is made specifically to humor and entertain people, and has no other hidden agenda whatsoever, this is definitely a must watch."
"jordan2240","1","341","605","23 June 2013"," This is the End of me ever attending a Seth Rogen creation
","This was perhaps THE worst movie I've ever seen. Perhaps my wife and I are simply too old for the subject matter (50s), but sex-oriented jokes, drug use, and constant use of the f-word do not a humorous movie make - and we are not prudish people, particularly my wife. I think I smiled once, and I heard my wife giggle once, but I was as close to walking out of a movie as I've ever come. I doubt there was much of a script involved, and my guess is that all of the actors were told to ad-lib the nastiest sex joke that could get an 'R' rating they could think of. I mean a five minute scene about ejaculating all over someone's house...??? Hardy-har-har. I now hate Danny McBride even more than I did before this garbage, and what the hell was Emma Watson thinking.<br/><br/>There is absolutely NOTHING I can recommend about this movie, and I think it's the only one I've ever given 1 star to. Complete garbage. The only way I'll ever attend another movie that Seth Rogen is in is if he shows up unexpectedly in a bit part. He and his pal Evan Goldberg have no writing talent whatsoever, and I can't say much about Rogen's acting either. How they make a living in this business is beyond explanation. Thanks for this utter waste of time fellas. You got me."
"ashhhroy","Null","313","557","3 May 2013"," If you love these actors, you'll love the movie!
","If you've seen Superbad, Pineapple Express, etc., then you know the type of humor this movie will have. I, for one, could watch James Franco, Seth Rogan, and Danny McBride leisurely eat a sandwich and manage to laugh my butt off. Thankfully this movie is much more exciting than that. It's brilliant that they all just play themselves and manage to poke fun at their own lifestyles. Expect weed and drug humor of course. The plot sets itself up for hilarity, as they all take refuge in James Franco's fortress of a mansion while the world outside them goes up in flames. Cabin fever mixed with dwindling supplies results in hilarious situations and good one liners. <br/><br/>The movie made me laugh extremely hard and had all my favorite people in one film. I only wouldn't recommend this film if you're uptight and religious."
"darkorse6","1","244","430","30 June 2013"," Words cannot describe
","Seeing the reviews as almost overwhelmingly positive, I had high expectations. I figured, even if it only hit on a few notes, it would be entertaining. Alas, I was led astray, once again, by the Intertubes.<br/><br/>At the 1 hr mark, we finally had enough and walked out. Browsing carpet samples at Lowes was infinitely more entertaining than this piece of garbage. The only way to see this movie and feel any entertainment is to be completely stoned. I cannot fathom the source of all positive reviews I've seen online. I guess it's because there's some attempts early on at self deprecating humor as they make fun of all the cameos.<br/><br/>Some people must see it that way, but I do not. To me, it was nothing more than 107 minutes of a self-indulgence where the actors were so caught up in their awesome idea for a film they forgot to actually WRITE SOME WITTY DIALOG! Seriously, the scene between Franco and McBride about leaving loads all over the place was humorous for the first 5 seconds, but hey...why not stretch this 7th grade humor out another 2 minutes? The audience will LOVE it because WE think it's funny and WE ARE SO AWESOME! <br/><br/>I found it offensive, not for the subject matter, but for how they treat the audience. Rogan thinks his jokes about 'playing the same character in every movie' somehow make it excusable to sit back and do it again? This is a lazy sophomoric stupid humorless pile of stinking garbage that makes me feel bad about losing the 60 minutes of my life I lost before coming out of my coma and walking out.<br/><br/>Rogan and crew, even though they DO play the same characters all the time, can at LEAST feel good that they have some witty dialog in their movies. In this movie, I was waiting for that but it never came. When the sinkhole opened up, I wished I would've been able to fall in and surrender to the sweet release of death rather than endure any more of this circle-jerk ego trip."

","Okay, we all have seen a lot of comedy movies but they were not good as we expected. Or we always had to wait for a scene to laugh and t only made us to smile a little bit! This is the End is a great movie! Surprisingly good. They are a lot of scenes that you get surprised and that makes you laugh hard. The plot of the story is based on true character names and that makes you wonder are they really the same person in the real life? It was confusing because some part of the movie was exactly about the real characteristics of the actors and that's what I like about the movie! I think this comedy is far one of the best comedies I've ever seen. Highly RECOMMENDED!!! 10/10"
"petrosinorobertm","3","271","483","17 June 2013"," This is a Big Let Down
","I feel like I saw a different movie than everyone else. It's simply not funny, I think I laughed once. We really don't need to see a erect, giant, detailed, graphic phallus in every movie, it's not funny. Then to have to sit through an extended portion of Satan walking around with his junk out is not funny and not needed. I'm not prudish but this movie adds male genitals just to do it, it was a lame movie. Write something creative like 40-year old virgin. This movie was lamer than Pineapple Express and Your Highness. If you expect the wit of Knocked Up, you'll be as disappointed as me. Save your money. <br/><br/>None of the characters in the film are likable in the least, and they are supposed to be playing themselves. I do not know why people are treating Seth Rogen like he is incapable of mailing it in because This Is The End is lazy and feels like it was mailed in to fulfill an obligation to the movie studio. I also feel cheated by the excellent reviews this movie received from the paid critics. How did anyone find this trash funny?"

Nope.<br/><br/>I honestly think I laughed MAYBE 5 times...Emma Watson was my favorite part of the whole movie...Well and Channing Tatum, that was kinda hilarious.<br/><br/>But really, so disappointed by this movie. 2 friends fell asleep, and another friend and myself kept giving each other this look like ""Wtf are we watching..Is it over yet??""

"jjdamore11","1","227","427","16 June 2013"," Had potential but failed miserably
","I went in to this movie today expecting to laugh hard. I have been a fan of Seth Rogan, James Franco and all the rest so I knew what kind of comedy to expect. I found the first couple of scenes funny but then the movie just took a nosedive. I get that they are poking fun at their lifestyles, but is Rogan boasting to the world that he's a pothead? And if Michael Cera doesn't really snort cocaine, then why on Earth would he want to portray that he does?? These aren't characters that they are playing, they are playing themselves in this film. So this movie tells me that these people are immature drug obsessed morons, and it is a real shame that people like this get paid incredible salaries when so many real good people are out there slaving on minimum wage. I know some people may think I've over-analyzing this but I'm not. In a movie where the actors portray themselves, I'm personally stunned that they willingly participated in a movie where not only aren't they selected to get in Heaven, that they continue to act like immature imbeciles (especially McBride) in a time of biblical apocalypse. And one last note, anyone that finds images of a man's junk everywhere hilarious, really has some maturing to do. If I could give this movie no stars I would. I really am upset I wasted money and time on this one."
"b-rocks-382-365853","4","176","336","12 June 2013"," Just bad
","I had heard good things from friends about this and I kind of wanted to see it. So I decided might as well go see it. Before I saw what I am about to say, I am a huge fan of almost all the movies these actors have made. I thought pineapple Express, Hot tub time machine, Superbad, and Knocked up were all amazing movies. I died in laughter throughout all of those movies. However, I thought this movie was really bad.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the movie, I found almost all jokes and everything very amusing. i thought it was going to be great until after Danny McBribes scene when he appear. From that point on it just went down hill. The jokes started to get worse. I thought I was the only one at first that thought the movie was getting a little redundant and ridiculous. It was then when i looked around and relieved people had stopped laughing as well. I found myself waiting for the movie to get better but it was just getting worse the jokes were just getting run into the ground (Danny McBride and James Franco referring to masturbating on everything). By the end, all I could think was I wasted 10.50$.<br/><br/>One of the most disappointing was almost all the actors. Seth Rogen, awful. Michael Cera, really weird. Jonah Hill, just bizarre I mean I personally found his performance really strange. Craig Robinson, Okay but wasn't very funny. Danny McBribe, funny at first but then grew on as very annoying. James Franco, funny. <br/><br/>Overall, I really did not like this movie. Between the rape references and biblical references, I found it to be really weird. I usually don't care about that stuff but like I said they would drive it into the ground. I would honestly wait until this is on Netflix. Trust me, this will be on Netflix's for sure. Really not worth 10.50$."
"hitndip789","10","181","361","23 April 2013"," So Funny and Entertaining

Its non stop laughing from the opening scene to closing. Everything about this movie is great, the story, the actors, and the comedy. Having such funny actors like James Franco, Seth Rogen, Jonah Hill, Jay Baruchel, Danny McBride, and Craig Robinson playing themselves all in one movie just makes it that more entertaining. If you liked the comedy in Superbad and Pineapple Express, you will love This Is the End. I recommend this movie to everyone who has a sense of humor.

","Was lucky enough to see a preview of this tonight, and can recommend it to anyone looking for a funny, modern and silly yet at times shocking comedy. Not sure how it can have a score of only 6.4 at the moment, the film is easily the best comedy of the year so far and deserving of an 8 or my case a nine as i was so pleasantly surprised by the quality of the jokes and the story.<br/><br/>The cast is perfect and the cameos aren't there to fill out the movie and take up time, they are excellent especially Emma Watson and Michael Cera. There are a few scary jumps on the way but the humour will carry you through it, as i said the story so well written you'll go with the flow.<br/><br/>Go watch it you won't be disappointed!"

I went to see this with my parents last night...now, I am in my 30, my parents are in their 50's, and we all loved Your Highness and other movies that some of these actors are in separately. Franco and McBride can be hilarious, but this was far from their finest moment. Seriously, we collectively laughed 4 times. I kept count. The only reason that I am giving this a 2 and not a 1 is that there was a scene where some large 4 legged demon came launching into the scene and my mother jumped and dumped half her candy.<br/><br/>How do I get my money back for this complete waste? I feel completely and utterly duped. The reviews said it was great overall, I wonder what has happened to society when an entire scene dedicated to an argument about masturbating on a magazine is funny. There have been some funny jokes about masturbation in other movies, this sure as hell isn't one of them.<br/><br/>I seriously want my money back."

","I don't know what all the bad reviews are about. I loved the idea of using the actors' real names but creating alternate personalities. The humour is great, and special effects are rather realistic! Also, I particularly loved Michael Cera and Paul Rudd's appearances! Great job to the writers, directors and actors. For me, this was the perfect combination of comedy, horror and sci-fi. There was a sense of doom throughout, especially with the wide shots of LA, which made me feel quite uncomfortable, but then there was plenty of comic relief. <br/><br/>I don't often laugh at movies, but if you're looking for a relaxed, light comedy, I would recommend this film."

I laughed my arse off at East Bound and Down seasons 1 & 2. This movie is on par/slightly higher on profanity and vulgarity but FAR lower on comedy. This pile of sacrilegious garbage almost had my girlfriend and me leave (a first and we've seen some horrible films). In fact, if it weren't for the other people in the row we would have left. And on that same thought, of all 12 people in the theater 2 other people DID walk out.<br/><br/>This movie can be summed up as horrible CGI, a bunch of drugs, a bunch of penises, and no humor. I wish I didn't waste 2 hours and $20 on this garbage. I pity the human race if people seriously think this movie is an 8 (the rating at the time of this review).<br/><br/>1/10 is generous."
"jan_kalina","10","33","58","4 February 2015"," ""I don't wanna die at James Franco's house.""
","Some comedy premises seem to go over people's heads. Which the case with This Is The End. The film is based on an idea that the actors play exaggerated versions of themselves, based on the characters they play in their films, which seem to be the same character over and over again. Or they play completely against type - Michael Cera's case.<br/><br/>The idea of actors playing themselves always seems intriguing to me and here it serves as a basis for letting Rogen and his friends goof off. The film perfectly serves the celebrity lifestyle and the culture surrounding them. It even briefly touches upon how people are obsessed with these celebrities. The plot revolves around a James Franco's housewarming party when an apocalypse hits the Hollywood Hills. Those who survive the earthquake, fortify themselves in Franco's house and wait for the rescue which may never come.<br/><br/>This results in hilarious series of fights, arguments and gags. The mystery element about the apocalypse keeps interested in the film. The ending is just simply madness but that is exactly what I expect from a comedy like this: to be surprised.<br/><br/>Rogen, Franco and the rest of the pack are amazing as always. Danny McBride plays the biggest scumbag that has ever walked the earth. If you are fan of these comedians, then you are in for a treat. Even though you are not, I believe you will have a splendid time and perhaps you will become a fan as well."

I went in knowing how dumb it was going to be and found it really funny at parts and I liked the dark comedy eased with more immature slapstick comedy. A lot of these negative reviews I've read either have some kind of religious agenda against this movie or were people trying to measure how big their cinema knowledge penis is by citing great foreign films and comparing how much it falls short. It's a stoner comedy made by stoner nerd's that happened to find success and are probably just as baffled as these harsh critics are as to how they achieved it. In a movie filled with celebrity cameos and over the top CGI and humor, it felt to me like it was still a down to Earth movie they probably spent 30 minutes writing and had a blast filming and getting friends together and showed Hollywood excess from the point of view of the outsiders. If you were offended or wrote this movie off because it wasn't up to your standards, you're not the audience this movie had any intention of appeasing.

There's a certain taste of playful irony in the fact that so many of these actors, Rogen, Jonah Hill and Danny McBride especially, who share the common criticism of merely playing themselves throughout their careers, are doing so literally this time around. They're able to play that up to ridiculous extremes and big laughs in the long-form party scene that eats up most of the first act, riffing and rolling with the punches in their never-ending quest to make the cast and crew smile. Predictably, that's the film's sweet spot - a blank slate for ad-lib spoils - and when it's finally cast aside to make way for a more coherent narrative (admittedly, a very loose one) their ship springs a big leak. Where a more thoroughly-incubated concept like Shaun of the Dead is able to easily blend quick, witty banter with big set pieces and wild, frenzied action, This is the End struggles to unify an equally diverse toolbox. I can get the fish-out-of-water aspect that was being fronted here, of a catered group of celebrities who were lost when their smartphones dropped off the grid, but that runs out of gas near the three-quarter mark and when the big special effects swing and miss, there's nothing left to carry us the rest of the way. Really uproariously funny at a few points, but pointlessly thin and overblown at others.<br/><br/>Additional thoughts after a recent re-watch:<br/><br/>Like a lot of Rogen and company's films, I think this works far better if you fit one or two descriptions: happy-intoxicated or just in the mood for something completely mindless. Last night I was both, and man did it hit a sweet spot. Of course, the opening party scene has the greatest bits - actors and celebrities poking fun at themselves and the vapid public image that typifies their slice of pop culture - but it also functions well when the crowd is significantly reduced and the plot shifts from a snappy ensemble comedy to a much smaller crew in the midst of a disaster. The transition from dialog-driven laughs to a frantic survival parody is so sudden, the only thing I can compare it to is the infamous directorial shift of From Dusk Till Dawn. This is the End, though, pulls off that wheel jerk more than once. Of course, such swerves cause the storyline to spiral completely out of control, but that unpredictability is partially what makes it so stupidly entertaining. Not something I'd want to watch most nights, but it's also more consistently knee-slap funny than I remembered. Upon review, I'd upgrade my original score from an 6 to an 8."

","I started watching this film purely because of the decent score it had received. I should have known better. Yet again Seth Rogen and pals star in a ""comedy"", that would only make the simplest of teenage boys laugh.<br/><br/>The story itself is fairly interesting and I hold nothing against gore, but the dialog and the attempted humor are on a level that a monkey could achieve, and to be honest, this style of comedy hasn't been fun for over a decade (Beavis and Butthead was good at the time, not now). I understand in some ways that humor is subjective and thus not anyone can like every kind of comedy, but this brain damaging rubbish just makes me sad at the decadence of this society."

"colincec","10","26","47","30 January 2014"," A shameless side-splitter
","This Is The End is a movie that really shouldn't have worked, yet had me doubled over laughing for the entire film. The idea of a bunch of Hollywood actors playing exaggerated versions of themselves as a band of survivors in the Biblical Apocalypse sounds like something that should fall flat on its face, but it surprisingly carries the whole way through, in part because the actors look like they're having a ball making it. To say more would risk spoiling some hilarious scenes, so I'll give you some brief non-spoiler comedic highlights: Jonah Hill's shtick as the nicest guy in the world, Jason Siegel lampooning his own role on How I Met Your Mother, Michael Cera as an unapologetic sex and cocaine addict, anything that Craig Robinson does, the fake trailer for Pineapple Express 2, and EVERYTHING involving Emma Watson. So if you're into getting some unapologetically raunchy and ridiculous comedy with a surprising amount of heart, catch it in theaters while you can. That said, approach with caution if you're allergic to the Backstreet Boys because you'll have that stuck in your head after you're done."

IMDb should really soon create some sort of ghost-review detection, because no way in hell would this movie get above 3 avg. If someone had not boosted it with multiple tens.

"jcbutthead86","10","27","51","22 June 2013"," A Brilliant,Original,Hilarious,Funny,Over The Top Apocalyptic Comedy.
","This Is The End is an brilliant,hilarious,funny and over the top Apocalyptic Comedy and one of the funniest movies in recent years. Filled with great direction,a wonderful cast(playing themselves),a fantastic screenplay and great special effects,This Is The End is an original,wild and offbeat Comedy you won't soon forget.<br/><br/>Set in Los Angeles,California,This Is The End tells the story of Seth Rogan(Seth Rogan)who picks up his friend Jay Baruchel(Jay Baruchel)at the airport and are about to hang together in L.A. While hanging together,Rogan and Baruchel decide to go to James Franco's(James Franco)house party and have a good time but good times turn to bad when the Apocalypse happens and destroys Los Angeles. Now Rogan,Franco and Barchel along with fellow celebrities including Jonah Hill,Craig Robinson and Danny Mcbride have to deal with the Apocalypse where laughs and mayhem ensues.<br/><br/>This Is The End is easily one of the best Comedies in recent years,a brilliant Comedy that deals with the Apocalypse or the end of the world but in it's own creative and unique way. Now there have been many films that have dealt with the apocalypse or the end of the world but there hasn't been a film that has dealt with the Apocalypse like This Is The End a funny,hilarious,original and wild film that has real life movie stars pretty much playing fictional versions of themselves in a film that is a that is a wonderful movie experience that you will never forget. Once the Action in This Is The End starts it just never stops and as you are watching the film you pulled into an insane and weird film where everything is pushed to the limit and goes so far over the top that you as the viewer will feel like you are in a Comedy and a surreal funny nightmare and the laughs and jokes in the film are just completely none stop almost to the point of where you are laughing so hard your stomach will hurt and tears will run down your eyes and face because the jokes and laughs are smart and witty. Directors and co-writers Seth Rogan and Evan Goldberg take the great Apocalyptic genre and flip's the genre on it's head giving us a film that is a Stoner film,a Fantasy and a Horror film all in one where the film's main characters are trying to survive by not going outside but trying survive with each other inside James Franco's house and some of the scenes with the movie's main characters are just down right hilarious because it balances out friendship as well as tension not knowing if the film's characters are going to live or die. The real life actors playing themselves in this movie is ingenious showing viewers actors in the film and how in a fictional way how they would act if the end of the world did happen and it's done in a wild and unforgettable way. The Apocalypse in the film is played with laughs but is also done in a straight forward manner thanks to the actors so the film doesn't become a Spoof or a Parody but the laughs are always there. The screenplay by Seth Rogan and Evan Goldberg is excellent and well-written with lines of memorable dialog that is very funny,profane and vulgar and with great moments of creativity and style as well writing in hilarious scenes that reference some of the main actors films which include Pineapple Express as well as funny and over the top references to Horror classics such as The Exorcist and the film Rosemary's Baby. The screenplay and film is so funny you will be asking and craving for more when the film ends. If you loved Seth Rogan and Evan Goldberg's other collaborations Superbad and Pineapple Express,you will love This Is The End. The violence and gore in the film are grisly and gruesome at times and will makes some viewers cringe but the movie's violence and gore fit with the tone of the film and are done for great laughs. The ending of the film will make you laugh your head off and will surprise you with a couple of cameos that you will not see coming. It's a wonderful ending.<br/><br/>The whole cast(playing themselves)including Seth Rogan,James Franco,Jonah Hill,Jay Baruchel,Danny McBride(who steals the movie)and Craig Robinson are all excellent and hilarious as fictional versions of themselves. Also lookout for funny cameos by celebrities also playing fictional versions of themselves Emma Watson,Michael Cera,Christopher Mintz-Plasse,Kevin Hart,Jason Siegal,Rianna,Paul Rudd and more.<br/><br/>The direction by Seth Rogan and Evan Goldberg is fantastic,with Rogan and Goldberg using great camera angles and giving the film a wonderful visual style. Great direction by Rogan and Goldberg.<br/><br/>The score by Henry Jackman is great,powerful and effective and matches the tone of the film. Good score by Jackman. The film also has great songs on the soundtrack by Whitney Houston(I Will Always Love You),Dr Dre(The Next Episode),Black Sabbath(War Pigs),Cypress Hill(When The S*** Goes Down),The Backstreet Boys(Everybody,(Backstreet's Back)and more. Good soundtrack.<br/><br/>The special make-up effects by K.N.B effects are amazing,bloody and realistic and add to the film's greatness. K.N.B does it again.<br/><br/>In final word,if you love Comedies,Apocalypse films,Superbad or Pineapple Express,I highly suggest you see This Is The End,an amazing, funny,hilarious and original Comedy that you won't regret watching and is well worth your time. Highly Recommended. 10/10."

Not only was this the worst movie I have ever seen, I had the displeasure of seeing it with my grandfather, who walked out less than 30 minutes into the film.

"enigma-947-339467","1","33","66","6 November 2013"," If a movie like this has a 7/10 rating, it REALLY says where society is at right now and that's in an awful place
","I saw the 7/10 rating, so I gave this movie a go. I wish I didn't.<br/><br/>To say this movie is complete sophomoric trailer-trash wouldn't even come close to doing those terms any justice.<br/><br/>Good chunks of this movie contained some of the most vile and repulsive content that I've ever seen, and I've seen it all. Really. I'm not sure why classless filth like this is so insanely pervasive these days, yet no one seems to care, or even notice how bad ""things"" have really become. Hell, audiences seem to eat it up like candy. What does that say about society today? It says a lot, unfortunately. I'm surprised the convicted rapist, and ""cannibal"", Mike Tyson, wasn't in this. Society has made him a rock star, even after everything he's done. Jeez, what do you have to do to get shunned by society today?<br/><br/>The LAST thing a person would call me is a prude.. but come on, really guys? The ""actors"" in this movie should have been ashamed to be a part of this ""film"", especially Seth Rogen, being one of the writers of the story and screenplay of this trash.<br/><br/>If I was an actor that was offered a part, I would have read the screenplay and said, ""Are you serious? Is this a joke?"", and lit it on fire. I don't care how much they were willing to pay me.<br/><br/>Just the idea of one of my kids, or ANY child seeing this movie would literally make me vomit. Hell, I don't think it's even remotely appropriate for most teens that could legally watch this film, and hell, even 20-somethings. Sorry readers, TONS of kids and tweens watch R-rated movies. Their parents either don't care, or they just watch it over a friends house, on the net, on their phones, pirate it, etc.<br/><br/>When I saw Danny McBride make an appearance, I knew exactly where this movie was headed. How is this man a paid actor, and WHY? He is easily one of the most repulsive, vulgar, and offensive idiots I've ever seen. He plays the same exact douche in EVERY movie or show he is in. Wow, that's SO challenging! He just adds so much to society, doesn't he? We're so lucky to have him.<br/><br/>I don't get why anyone would think he's funny. All he does is swear and be as offensive and as vulgar as possible... like so much of the rest of this movie. It's not even remotely challenging to be offensive! How is he paid to do it?<br/><br/>There is no way to spoil this movie...but, I have to mention it, so here is where I need to prove my point about this ""film"", using spoilers.<br/><br/>A demon, with a raging black erection, rapes Jonah Hill. On a side note, why is there so much penis in movies today? Do audiences really crave looking at a flaccid penis? I highly doubt it. I didn't even think they could show an erect penis, even if it was fake, in an R-rated movie. Up till a few years ago, I've almost never seen a penis in a movie at all. Now I can name 10 off the top of my head from the last 3 years, probably 1-2 years.<br/><br/>The two scenes that told me society has truly gone to hell is where James Franco and Danny McBride are screaming at talking (yelling) about ejaculating on each other. Seriously guys? Could you be any more low-brow and disgusting? Who really thinks that's funny, and why? I think scenes like this have really bottomed out... I can't imagine they could get much worse. I'm sure they will though. Shock comedy is where everything has been headed for years now. It requires no talent whatsoever to just be disgusting and vile. Anyone could do it. Why would people pay these actors to do it?<br/><br/>When I saw Satan make an appearance, I was like ""nice special eff...wtf?""... Then I saw his giant, glowing/fiery dangling penis... especially how they gratuitously shot it. Satan has a penis? Does God have a penis too, or is that comment offensive? I was literally in shock as I'm sitting there watching Satan stomping around with his giant penis flopping around in slow motion. WTF? Really?<br/><br/>Talk about scraping the bottom of the barrel. This movie makes some of the WORST porn out there look like classy pieces of art.<br/><br/>Blah! Society is so far in the gutter these days, I weep for our children. Values? What? What are those?"
"mkirkpatrick02","1","29","57","26 October 2013"," Hilarously horrible
","I was excited to see this movie when it came out. I'm a fan of 90% of the actors in the film and I figured there was no way this movie wouldn't be hilarious. Oh boy was I wrong. It's important to note that I don't like ""stoner"" flicks to begin with and this certainly is a stoner flick, which I didn't expect from the previews. I think drugs were either shown or mentioned at least every two minutes, there was a good five minute back and fourth about male ejaculation, which was just annoying to me and not funny at all. I suppose I like more clever forms of humor.<br/><br/>Overall I just think it was a waste of having so many talented and hilarious actors in one film and probably the only thing that saves it from being the worst movie ever made is the fact that it's supposed to be a comedy, so the horrible acting and storyline can hide behind its genre because if you laugh at all, it'll just be over how stupid and asinine the whole thing is."

Apart from the obvious, like Michael Cera's hilarious performance in it, its an original unexpected comedy with a great script. Its about friendship and it has a lot of pop culture references, which I loved about it.<br/><br/>I saw it here in Los Angeles, where I'm staying for the film festival, I actually bumped into Michael Cera on the way to the movie, he seemed like a very cool guy, when I asked him for a picture, instead he said ""You know what, I'd like to get to know you instead"" and he shook my hand, it was pretty cool.<br/><br/>Overall its a very fun movie, wait to see Craig Robinson in it, I couldn't stop laughing at everything he did, but avoid seeing it with someone who's already seen it, you don't want them to spoil anything for you. As a matter of fact, just stop reading this review now if you haven't seen it and go see it, I really hope this movie gets the attention it deserves. By the way, the ending was just brilliant.

","I just saw This is the End with a group of friends and was struck by something I'm sure a lot of other viewers found: these guys are a lot like me and my friends! And that, in a nutshell, is what makes This is the End such a funny, relatable and downright entertaining movie! The movie is full of slapstick, some special effects, and big names, but what it comes down to is the writing. The banter in this film between the actors is so sharp and humorous, that you find yourself sucked into the conversations even more than the plot itself. If you're anything like me, you read up on some behind-the-scenes trivia about the movie and found that about 50% of the movie was ad-libbed. Knowing that made the movie that much funnier. Seth Rogen and his writing/directing partner Evan Goldberg are just geniuses. The way they can take grown men, and reduce them to infantile children is gold. The interactions between the men is hilarious and you feel like the luckiest fly on the wall that ever lived. These actors are some of the biggest players in the comedy world and to watch them take bites out of these roles like they're big juicy apples was amazing to watch. I'm sure Seth hemmed and hawed over whether to make the actors portray themselves, and I tell you, what a difference it makes. You feel like you intimately and genuinely know these people and it makes the experience that much more enjoyable. Without ruining anything, I will say that there are more than a couple stand out scenes in the film and the actors were so good that I couldn't pick just 1 stand out role! OK, I'll backtrack: anything Danny McBride does is absolute genius and this film is no different. Jonah Hill also makes a case for himself to star in bigger comedic roles in the future. (Check out an ""explosive"" scene between McBride and Franco and tell me you won't die laughing). As always, James Franco lends a cool quality to gross out humour but he stands right up there with the best of them! Craig Robinson is effortless in his timing and delivery and Jay Baruchel plays the straight man to a tee. To me, This is the End marks a new chapter in film comedy. And I'm dying to see what Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg have in store for us next."

","As a fan of spoof movies, I couldn't wait to get into this film, but the first 10 minutes almost bored me to death.

He crushed a girl's skull and then vanished, and I would have loved to have seen him in the movie.<br/><br/>The only bits that created a bit of a giggle from me included Robinson and possessed Jonah Hill. My boyfriend loved it, but then again he's a child at heart. Penis, weed and sex jokes are aplenty. Too many, in fact. I was actually angry I paid for this movie, and was so happy that it had ended that I sang 'Everybody' with the Backstreet Boys. Do not watch this film if you have two brain cells to rub together."

","One obvious question such a movie endeavours to answer is: ""how bad can it really get""<br/><br/>On the surface, the finest of younger Hollywood are part of its credits, although in retrospect how that came to be raises some very uncomfortable questions.<br/><br/>It all starts with a get together, where two friends join a Hollywood style party one of whom is not keen at all.

As the intriguing (being ironing) story unfolds, it turns out that Satan in the form of a giant charcoal statue with a sizeable p..., commences Aramgedon.<br/><br/>This synopsis tell it all. Poor story of particularly bad taste, with ample of tackiness similar to a B horror movie, to the point I found myself wishing they could all just evaporate so that I could leave and head home.<br/><br/>In all fairness they were some amusing scenes and decent one liners but could do nothing to salvage this rubbish of a movie.<br/><br/>One thing I will not get over, is how such a cinematic junk got the most known younger Hollywood to take part is a question for the ages.

"jhardinggg","1","40","87","22 June 2013"," An honest review for ""This Is The End""
","Please, please... bear with me here and read my explanation of my rating below.<br/><br/>I must preface my writing with a few things. First, I never wrote a movie review on this website before. Mostly, because I am too lazy to and there are many other knowledgeable reviewers who already do so (and my views generally resonate with the majority). Second, I purposely registered on IMDb to write this review (because it was so bad). Third, I just got back from watching ""This Is The End"" at the movie theater.<br/><br/>I first thought my views of this movie was based on my age. Perhaps I am getting old and the new wave of comedic humor is upon us. Perhaps the days of Jim Carrey, Chris Farley, Steve Martin, John Candy, Eddie Murphy, and Dan Aykroyd are way behind us (and that's OK). However..., at age 29, I kinda feel like I'm not missing the boat here.<br/><br/>I love modern day comedians like Vince Vaughn and Will Ferrell, but this movie was totally different. It was absolutely awful. I actually laughed (probably the only laughing) at how horrible it was. I almost felt embarrassed how quiet the theater was - embarrassed that these actors consciously made this movie with their reputations tied to it.<br/><br/>James Franco has a few very good movie performances, and Jonah Hill was fabulous in Superbad. Seth Rogen was OK in a couple movies, but was an ""OK supporting character"" at best. I'm actually quite surprised that he has risen to stardom (or at least some level) as a comedic actor. Quite frankly, I feel it is pathetic.<br/><br/>I recently (last week) heard Seth Rogen on The Howard Stern show. He was promoting this movie. It sounded like a great weekend activity, so I checked the IMDb.com ratings (which I generally agree with), and saw an 8 out of 10. The good thing was, I didn't watch any previews or trailers, so I was excited to go into the movie with any biased (or previous) knowledge of the movie.<br/><br/>This movie was horrendous. Honestly. I have seen hundreds of movies and honest to God, I cannot think of a movie that was worse than this one. The acting was awful - forced and not funny. I am one who loves any kind of humor (nasty, graphic, sexual, inappropriate, etc.), but scenes in this movie tried making fake humor rather than creating it more naturally. <br/><br/>Is this the dawn of a new generation of comedy? Am I (at 29) already old, and in a separate comedic generation? Is 'forced attempts at humor' the new humor - viewers acknowledging that actors are ""trying to be funny"" and thus, must BE funny? Wow, I sure hope not.<br/><br/>In my opinion... unfortunately, I feel the title ""This Is The End"" should be a description of these actors' careers. Again - I love Jonah Hill and others in previous films... but this was embarrassing. Seth Rogen was never really good, so I'm not surprised."

","*May Contain Spoilers*<br/><br/>I am not a twenty something stoner, let me say that right off. However, I do not need to be stoned to find something funny. I love to laugh and I seek out comedy, and thus, I am open to all types of comedy. I want to laugh. I was hoping This Is The End would make me laugh. It did. Twice. Once when the lady in the convenience store said something off screen no less. And again when Jonah Hill reenacts Rosemary's Baby. That's one laugh per hour. That's not good. Here we have what I guess we could call The Brat Pack for the 2000's: ""The Frat Pack"", let's call them. They partake in yet another ""romp"" wherein they imbibe drugs and call one another effing dix. They all ready did this in medieval drag. It wasn't very funny then. Now, in apocalyptic drag, it's simply abysmal. We're asked to find the Pack playing themselves hilarious in and of itself. One would think self-satire would ensue. It doesn't. Self congratulation certainly does though. Not only in the tone of the film but literally in the dialog as each ""celebrity"" attempts to justify their aww shucks, I'm just good folks down to Earth movie star. Well, if these movie celebrities were such good folks, they wouldn't have foisted this dreck on their fans and movie audiences in general in the first place. You can seriously tell that these guys think gracing the world with their ""comedy"" is to do the world a favor. It's a kind of arrogance that's so delusional and masturbational that it devolves into actual ten minute conversations about the actors masturbation styles. It really would not have surprised me if the actors unveiled their genitals for the cameras and masturbated into the lens. This is not hyperbole: they would have thought it hilarious. It's a toss up as to who comes off the worst in this. It's as though the Pack is competing to see who can be the least charming and most obnoxious. Danny McBride certainly claims this prize. Is he supposed to be today's surly but lovable philistine, a la John Belushi? Probably. John Belushi, however, was funny. Embarrassing cameo? Let's give that one to Channing Tatum. As for what unfolds story-wise we have a premise and nothing else. No creative thought is put into it. The film bogs down for the better part of two hours on one set: five assholes in search of a movie. It reeks of rip-off, this monster improv session with rapidly diminishing returns. Brackish looking, shrill, dark, heavy handed zero fun. Sitting there wondering what the budget went to...paychecks for the Frat Pack, Payola for the movie critics maybe and the rest for marketing. This truly was the Apocalypse."

","This movie was the biggest heap of trash I have ever watched. I honestly have watched movies made on cell phones that were funnier. I liked all the other movies these actors were in, but I was never in love with them. That being said, at the end of the movie I felt like I had just watched a male porno with the same joke being repeated over and over again. <br/><br/>I understand people find drugs, alcohol, and sex funny nowadays, and that kind of humor is to be expected with these actors. But there was no creativity with it at all. It was literally the same jokes over and over again just recycled and said in a slightly different way. <br/><br/>By the end of the movie, I started laughing at the movie instead of with the movie. The movie averaged about one penis joke for every two minutes. I felt like I was trapped in Ron Jeremy's mind. And then there was the weird religious twist to it. Not sure what they were going for with it, but I am definitely a believer after this film. If Hell is anything like watching this film, I want to repent right now."

The idea and plot of actors playing themselves is unique and fresh. During a party at James Franco's house, the world begins to crumble. Seth Rogen, Craig Robinson, Danny McBride, Jonah Hill, Jay Baruchel, and James Franco all try to survive the apocalypse, and most importantly, try to survive from each other.

Not sure why I went into it thinking that was even a possibility, but I guess that was my own fault. <br/><br/>It's basically a whole bunch of show biz buddies 'n' celebrities crammed into one movie without any reason for it, and very little humour to otherwise justify it. These guys have done some decent stuff in the past, but half a dozen or however many films later of pretty much the same thing over and over and it's pretty tired at this point. Bringing in some more friends and adding some fancy special effects doesn't really do anything to spice things up. But I guess they've raked it in, and they'll do it again once they figure out the next thin disguise for what will essentially be the same movie yet again.<br/><br/>If you like this kind of thing no matter how many times you see it done over and over, yeah you'll no doubt like this one too."

Whilst Edgar Wright's The World's End is the superior film that is consistently funny and action packed flick, This is the End does offer many laugh out loud moments, using more crass and crude humour, having jokes ranging from masturbation, stoner jokes and violent slapstick. Some of the best moments include a trailer for 'Pineapple Express 2', Emma Watson's cameo and discussion between James Franco and Danny McBride over a porn mag. Other jokes are more miss or crude for the such as the demon's man parts. The main stars have excellent chemistry together and had a strong dramatic with Seth Rogan balancing his old friendship with Jay Baruchel who hates LA and his newer friends in the city.<br/><br/>If all else fails at least Kevin Hart dies a nasty death.<br/><br/>If you enjoy this film then Zombieland and Dogma are worth checking out.<br/><br/>7.5/10"

And the Backstreet Boys, but I'm pretty sure I'm in the minority on that last one, given other reviews.<br/><br/>I like immature, raunchy humor. Swears, sex jokes, nudity etc don't bother me one bit. I figured this movie would fit right in with Superbad, Knocked Up, The Hangover etc but it fell really short of all of those movies. The jokes are really lackluster and they go on until they aren't funny anymore. Unless they ended up being weird and cheesy instead of funny. There were a few moments I really liked, but most of this was crap. Not to mention how offensive some of it was. Rape isn't funny. There was a joke about Emma misunderstanding and thinking she was going to get raped. Okay. Mildly funny, but mostly because she kicked their butts after. But Jonah gets straight up raped by a demon and the audience is expected to laugh? Seriously?<br/><br/>Even the plot was awful. It's like they figured it wasn't necessary because they thought they could get us to laugh enough to not notice.

","This is the worst movie I have ever watched, and yes I have seen Santa Claus Conquers the Martians (1964) which is widely accepted as the worst movie ever made. I believe This is the End has stolen that title.<br/><br/>I understand that it is a stoner comedy, and I do enjoy plenty of it. This is the End has already been compared to plenty of recent movies of its genre, but this genre has existed for a while so I would prefer to compare it to an older movie.<br/><br/>Idle Hands (1999) is a movie about a lazy stoner who's hand becomes possessed and murders his parents, and many others, and must stop his hand before it kills his girlfriend. This movie, is ****ing retarded, but that doesn't make it bad. It was meant to be stupid, but it has a plain plot and clear intentions throughout the movie. The plot has more holes in it than a block of swiss cheese, but never once in the movie are you wondering why the characters are acting as they are. It has a clear setting and rising action which leads to a final battle against the main villain, the main characters hand.<br/><br/>This is the end has a clear setting, and nothing else. The character which are supposed to be the actors themselves, are static characters which means they have no depth and do not change at all by the end of the story. They start the story as baseless idiots and end as baseless idiots. Every character has the same personality, and they might as well be the same person.<br/><br/>This movie has no plot. Dead Serious. Nothing happens. There is what looks to be a plot in the first 20 minutes or so, and then nothing happens. They aren't trying to do anything, they just sit around telling dick jokes. And that is what killed this movie for me, so much time and effort was put into no payoff.

"LloydBayer","5","24","50","15 September 2013"," This is Not Really Funny.
","Frat-pack comedies hit an all-time high (excuse the pun) with THE HANGOVER. In an attempt to raise the bar, THIS IS THE END goes all out as an obnoxious, sexist, and highly outrageous inside joke. And the joke's on Hollywood. <br/><br/>The film is essentially set in two parts where we are first introduced to Hollywood celebrities playing themselves. These are not A-list celebrities but established comedians like Seth Rogen, Jonah Hill and actors of similar ilk. Basically, just about anyone from a Judd Apatow production. They are all here and they play themselves in the most unbelievable manner allowed in an R-rated comedy. The central theme is male bonding with Jay Baruchel exhibiting said issues when his friend Seth Rogen is invited to a party hosted by James Franco. At the party they meet Jonah Hill, Paul Rudd, Jason Segel and everyone else you can think of who are not in the same frat-pack league as Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson and the likes. As you can imagine, the party is swinging with alcohol, weed, women and crude sexuality including a self-indulgent Michael Cera. But just when you think this is going to be an amped up version of SUPERBAD or PINEAPPLE EXPRESS, the story shifts into darker territory with an apocalyptic end-of-days scenario straight out of the Book of Revelations. What follows is a bizarre attempt at survival but filled with slapstick moments of under-belt humor, decapitation and dismemberment, exorcism, and an unending array of sex-gags; all of which are nothing new to the genre, but questionable as an outrageous comedy that literally grabs Armageddon by the balls. <br/><br/>Is it funny? The answer to that question relies heavily on how much you like these actors or their previous films. We have seen Hollywood actors play themselves in similarly themed comedies. Think Neil Patrick Harris in the HAROLD & KUMAR franchise or Bill Murray in ZOMBIELAND. But by sharing scripting and directing duties with Evan Goldberg, Rogen's achievement, at best, is pulling jokes within jokes. There are multiple references to various Hollywood celebrities (even one about George Cloony and Sandra Bullock), about themselves and characters they have played in their own movies. All this may sit well with die-hard fans but what about the casual movie-goer with little or no tolerance for unintelligent storytelling? <br/><br/>THIS IS THE END gets to a good start with cameos of famous actors playing exaggerated versions of themselves. Emma Watson and Rihanna included, Hill even refers to his Academy Award nomination in MONEY BALL. Then things turn for the worse once Danny McBride arrives on his one-trick-pony, playing his usual crass and narcissistic self. In not saying that the film is entirely unfunny, it is also far from bland. Then again, this becomes a matter of choice. What all this boils down to is the fact that these actors are clearly having fun by mocking themselves. And by doing so, they are also saying that they can afford to do so because the awful truth of the matter remains that as long as idiots pay to watch their movies, they get to walk the red carpet and have a blast in the process. But thankfully, all is not lost if you save your time and money for a similarly themed but far more boisterous comedy instead – THE WORLD'S END."

","When I first watched this movie, I had very high expectations after hearing from my friends that it's the next Superbad, one of my favorite movies of all time. After watching it, I can tell you it is a hilarious movie, but it's a completely different animal from the almighty Superbad. Superbad was funny because of the awkward and relatable characters and situations, and the humor flowed naturally from that. This movie, on the other hand, finds its humor more in individual jokes: its one-liners, funny insults, and the self-deprecating humor of each of the hilarious cast, stemming from the wise decision to have each actor play themselves. The movie definitely delivered everything I was expecting from a Seth Rogen movie, with all the weed and sex jokes you could want. The only thing I didn't like is it was extremely obvious every time the movie was trying to get you to laugh. But hell, I was laughing the whole way through."

","This movie, for me, was the biggest disappointment I've witnessed in a while. I seriously had big problems with falling asleep towards the end. <br/><br/>Now, I want to start off by saying that my bad review isn't due to a lack of appreciation for the more raunchy comedies because I , personally, love the Hangover and pretty much any Will Ferrell flick, but this movie was just altogether bad.<br/><br/>It started off on a good note. There were a few funny parts that led me to chuckle a bit, however after a the James Franco party got started the movie came to a screeching halt. <br/><br/>First of all, Michael Cera was so annoying that I was almost tempted to fast forward in hopes of his promised demise!<br/><br/>Jay's attitude towards everything was quite annoying, but I'll give that lack of enthusiasm about everything to the script. I'm sure it was just written so that we would hate that character's guts even though he's supposed to be their ""spirit"" guide??<br/><br/>The candid-cam type diary videos held minimal humor, but enough to slide the viewer into the next sequence which I found to be even more downhill than the last.<br/><br/>The entire plot of the movie turned out to center around the biblical Rapture (when God takes CHRISTIANS up to Heaven while the devil is allowed to roam the earth for 7 YEARS until Jesus comes back, defeats him, does the final judgement of everyone that was left behind, and sends all the bad -who took the mark of the beast- people and the evil beings and casts them into the lake of fire for eternity while God's kingdom resides on a new earth). However, they base their movie off of this religious for telling in a way where they essentially insult everyone who dare watch this picture as well as tell people that if (when) this does happen as long as you do one good deed you'll have an express pass up to the pearly gates. No, you don't have to repent for any previous wrongs or even evaluate previous life decisions in hopes for possibly making yourself into a better person. No change whatsoever...<br/><br/>The characters were not easy to like or relate to. The CGI devils were scary (I'll give them that), but not well placed. Their vision of Heaven was just a brighter version of the ""Hell on Earth"" they just left. The story line was a bit jumpy and at times left me sitting with a blank ""WHHHAATTT??"" on my face.<br/><br/>The commercial seemed to advertise a completely different movie if I do say so myself. I don't recommend it. <br/><br/>P.S.- you don't have to insert a cuss word every other word in order too add humor. Raunchy humor is funny, but when you overdo the profanity it just comes off as desperate for an ""R"" rating in order to make it seem more outrageous than it actually is..."

","I have officially lost faith in humanity (for real this time) after seeing the rating this film. The only reason I watched through this pile of 100% proof bovine fecal matter was due to the free beer over a friend place and I didn't wanted to be an arse and walked out midway.<br/><br/>Imagine juvenile jokes with poor taste, but performed by adults and repeated over for 5minutes per scene, this is the core entertainment value of this film. I felt violated. The part where the devil raped one of the character is a good metaphor for how the filmmaker wish to treat the audience since they have no respect for them. There are no scripts, just self indulgence and narcissism by the 'actors' who rather entertain themselves. One could easily find similar asinine behaviors but with much more entertainment value from an episode of Jackass. The idea of humor seems to be to make scenes distasteful as possible while lasting far longer than necessary and with as much vulgarity as possible for added effects. I may sound senile at this point, but I don't mind obscenity with style, such as from more worthwhile flicks like Dogma or Big Lebowski.<br/><br/>The only half redeemable factor was Jay Baruchel's performance, which almost make it seems he isn't enough of a jackass to belong in this film.<br/><br/>I personally demand a public apology by Danny McBride (because he managed to make me hate him) and a payment by Seth Rogan to be used toward my psychiatry care or better yet an exorcism to remove any memory traces of this film.<br/><br/>After the film ended, I muttered, ""That was the most horrible thing I've ever experienced."" My friend looked at me seriously and said, ""Now I truly know you have no taste in movies"". I'm still mystified by that statement, being that a guy that enjoy works from the likes of Fellini, Leone and Kurosawa. At least his taste in beer was good so I thanked him.<br/><br/>I will make sure to never watch anything that will include Seth Rogan and Danny McBride in the future. I implore you to not watch this film and I assure you will not miss anything worthwhile by dismissing it.<br/><br/>It's amazing the fact that I am an atheist and still managed to be offended by the fact that these pretentious and arrogant Hollywood 'actors' think they are allowed to go to heaven which is absurd, especially after the pains they caused me and undoubtedly to other viewers after watching this film."

","I'm pretty sure everyone has their own vision of how the world is going to end. Biblical Apocalypse? Nuclear war? Hit of a meteor? No matter how, the way of surviving it in 'This is the End' is by far the best I've seen on-screen. <br/><br/>The concept of the movie is rather simple - have a bunch of celebrities fighting for their life during the Apocalypse. It starts off rather inconspicuously - Jay Baruchel and Seth Rogen after spending a day on smoking weed and playing video games head to party at James Franco's new mansion. There are way too many cameos to include all of them in this review, but the most memorable ones are definitely Emma Watson (you need to see Hermione with an axe), Danny McBride and Michael Cera. However, they are mere additions to the main course of 'Pineapple Express'-like buddy comedy featuring Seth Rogen, Jay Baruchel, James Franco, Jonah Hill and Craig Robinson. <br/><br/>I wouldn't say the plot is non-existent, but it certainly isn't developed enough to pay much attention to it. The movie is rather a collection of gags with typical American humor, which is exactly what you would expect from anything created by the duo Seth Rogen-Evan Goldberg. But what's more, it is fairly obvious that the whole crew had so much fun making this movie. Be it playing soccer with a severed head, fighting over a Milky Way or filming the sequel to 'Pineapple Express' (hands down my favorite part of the movie) - it all seems to be pure fun to these guys. And it's amazing, because this atmosphere of good fun is passed to the audience. Plus it's nice to see big Hollywood names not taking themselves too seriously. <br/><br/>'This is the End' contains a fair amount of satire on the posh world of show-business. It also has a very simple, yet not so dumb message. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying it's anything overly ambitious or a piece of art that would leave you thinking about your life or state of the world. However, it makes the movie a bit better. That's always a good thing, right?<br/><br/>Overall, it's a very fun watch, especially if you have some friends and beer with you. It's simple - if you liked previous movies by Rogen- Goldberg, you're going to fall in love with this one. If you didn't - well, it's still worth a try. <br/><br/>For more reviews check: www.altentertainment.blogspot.co.uk"

If you see this and think it is as amazing as i do-go ahead and find yourself watching James Franco's roast it can almost make this movie even sweeter to see the real life crazy friendship they have and to almost see that perhaps the James/Seth obsession that they portrayed in the movie could almost be real.

This in itself adds a new dimension to Rogen's films in respect of him writing the script and directing it. Whilst the end-of-days happens around them, the comedic stars act like anyone would during a Post-Apocalypse film; turning on each other and deciding on matters related to surviving. <br/><br/>This film however also mixes comedy into the dark material, it's clear there are a lot of pokes at religions, identities and even personal bias and prejudice. This mixed in with trying to find drinkable water, and edible food gives us some hilarious moments between the stars of the film.

I also kind of like that a lot of people hated it.<br/><br/>I didn't find any of it offensive or over the line where other people did, so maybe if you have a ""over the line"" sense of humor, are hard to offend, aren't expecting a generic Hollywood formula comedy, and specifically liked ""get him to the Greek"" you might love this movie. You may not laugh much, but there's a potential to be highly entertained in this mildly crude and eerie atmosphere apocalypse comedy gem.<br/><br/>i give it 9/10 and I rarely even give great movies an 8. I reserve 9 for movies that are 1 number from the best movie of all time, and this IMO deserves a 9!<br/><br/>How can the first 30 reviews be mostly 1/10 but this movie is still has an above average rating?"
"napierslogs","8","14","29","16 June 2013"," How to make a stoner comedy with a bunch of friends and turn it into a smart, shrewd and hilarious statement on humanity
","A vanity project for a bunch of Hollywood's highest paid comedic actors, playing themselves in a ""stoner comedy"". So how do you make that good? By making it an hilarious, smart, insightful, satirical and scathing commentary on religion, celebrity and Los Angeles. And how do you make that successful? By making it a stoner comedy about a hapless group of actors saying and doing the stupidest things.<br/><br/>It actually starts out pretty slowly with a lame story being introduced. Jay Baruchel comes to LA to hang out with his friend Seth Rogen who wants to hang out with his friends James Franco, Jonah Hill and Craig Robinson, but Jay doesn't like his friends and he doesn't think that they like him. Sounds kind of lame doesn't it? The party at James Franco's house delivers the ridiculous, raunchy comedy which the target audience craves but it doesn't yet include the intelligence which the rest of the audience is applauding.<br/><br/>It seems like everybody in Hollywood is at James Franco's house. Michael Cera is doing coke, Jonah Hill is being friendly and everybody else is finding another drug to imbibe. While Jay and Seth are off to buy cigarettes, the Heavens open up and the Earth caves in. And then the real fun begins. Knowing the title of the film, or having read the bible, or really having seen any loose interpretation of the apocalypse, it's pretty obvious what is happening. And we get our first glimpse of the film's take on the celebrity culture and what it does (and what will eventually happen) to those at the center of it.<br/><br/>Our heroes aren't quite sure what's going on. Remember, they are actors in Hollywood. It's probably an earthquake, or it could be a zombie invasion, or it could be the end of the world as described in the New Testament's Revelation. But who believes that stuff?<br/><br/>The majority of the film takes place with our five actors holed up in James Franco's house – which is like a cement cave designed by himself since he's an artist. The jokes are vulgar, crass, silly but also incredibly insightful into who they are and the result is a perfectly written self-parody. You have to get past a lot of penis jokes, but once you do, you'll find an under-current tackling the issues of celebrity status but also of celebrities' biggest detractors, the religious congregation. I don't think ""This Is the End"" will be successfully duplicated any time soon, but I also don't foresee the apocalypse hitting any time soon."

","I went to see This Is The End thinking it will be silly and funny, judging by the trailer of the film. However, experiencing the film last night was like one long bad trip, and an unfunny, too, I must add! Most if not all of the film's jokes revolve around perverted sexual references, drugs (esp. Marijuana, of course!), and gore/violence. The film was completely tasteless and uncreative, and it does not deserve 8/10 on IMDb. The people who LOVED it, just like the actors. I have no problems with the actors. They probably could have made a much better film. The writing is poor, and so the result is mediocre. In any case, go see the film and judge it for yourself, but watching felt like being inside the mind of a mentally ill person who watches PORN or plays violent VIDEO GAMES all day while smoking WEED and snacking on junk food. I can go with Peter Sellers or Monty Pythons any day for silly tasteful comedy."

None of the characters act anywhere near what most people would do in a similar situation.

While I found about 10 gags to be genuinely hilarious, most of it was repetitive, vulgar solely for the shock value of being vulgar, and largely incoherent. With the exception of Emma Watson's tongue-in-cheek (on the face, not on the butt where most of the jokes landed) performance, the acting was sub-par for a Seth Rogan flick. I can see how teens could like it, but don't call this a ""good"" film in any way. Adults of any age, beware."

","I gave this five stars only because in the first half of the movie, the dialog and interaction between the stars was genuinely funny. I'm sure the writers had a blast making fun of all the movies the main actors had collectively made, but about the halfway point, the movie went into a death dive.<br/><br/>The writing suddenly shifted to endless penis, don't come in my house and drinking urine jokes that WERE raunchy and WEREN'T funny. Hysteria and huge, head-splitting special effects took over. The story became a soup pot into which the writers threw ""every crappy idea that popped into their drug addled heads"".<br/><br/>What a shame. At the beginning of the movie, I thought we might be treated to a version of The Hollywood Hangover. Alas, no such luck."

I don't understand why it's got such a low rating out of 10, I also don't understand how it's only rated R and not NC-17 as it should be. It's by far the funniest comedy I've seen in years and possibly ever. Being a huge fan of Franco, Rogen, Hill, and McBride, seeing this film was like a dream come true. Emma Watson is also very good in her role, surviving off of mustard and ketchup packets from McDonald's and eating rats, she truly embraced the comedy style that I just wasn't sure she could pull off!

","I thought I would always love comedies featuring Seth Rogen / Jonan Hill / James Franco for example Pineapple Express, Superbad, Knocked Up ----- I kept that belief until now. <br/><br/>This movie is a HOT MESS, it is so bad that I feel offended. First off Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg had never disappointed me once before and I've always admired their brilliant and funny storytelling, but I guess they were high when they wrote the story this time. Most of the plot doesn't make sense at all. Second, boring sex-oriented jokes filled the film. Yes sex-oriented jokes are funny most often but the director shockingly made all of them so tedious throughout the 107-minute film. I laughed 3 times during the film, that's it. Ultimately the biggest flaw in my opinion is it doesn't have a clear theme. I believe theme is the soul of every film, and it holds true even for comedies. In Superbad it is the bromance friendship and in Knocked Up it is new-dad love and responsibility run through the whole film subtly and make us laugh and touched simultaneously. That's the missing crucial part of this film – I don't know what kind of theme the film is trying to deliver. Unquestionably it is the most stupid 10 bucks I've ever spent.<br/><br/>I'm guessing you folks like the film only because of the cast. But let's face it, just by having Rihanna, Emma Watson, Channing Tatum on the cast does not justify a 7.8 out of 10, really."

This is the End is one weak plot line away from a Movie 43 rating of zero stars.<br/><br/>It's crass, loud, overwritten, not for Christians or admirers of quality and good taste. Mostly it just isn't funny, not unless you think you'll split your sides as a group of loud, brash morons argue about not raping Emma Watson.<br/><br/>Rape as a joke? Yup, that's the level! <br/><br/>The interminable opening scene, where they (directors Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg) introduce us to all the stars who play themselves and we lose the will to live, is saved only by Michael Cera, the solitary person on screen capable of playing a pastiche of himself that is remotely amusing. It's an agonizing ten minutes that aged me by ten years. When it finally gives way to the apocalypse implied by the title there are five minutes of fun, enjoyable effects and the suggestion of an action-packed, funny romp. And then it thuds to depths far beyond those where Rhianna et al end up.<br/><br/>The row I was in probably spanned the ages of 16 and 60 and I don't believe any of us laughed once. About 25% of the audience found it occasionally amusing and a group of three lads behind us clearly thought it was the funniest thing they'd seen all week. Either they had snorted the contents of a small country or someone lobotomizes the locals.<br/><br/>This is the End, which is asking for trouble with a title like that, is less funny than inhaling someone else's belch. The 'jokes' for the most part shouldn't have started and sure as hell didn't know where to end. Everything is elongated and has the feel of lazy writing, even lazier direction and protracted, narcissistic improvisation with no one to reign it in.<br/><br/>My head hurts.

There was a couple things I didn't like though. Like Jonah Hills personality in the movie was so annoying, this was probably my least favorite roll he has played. <br/><br/>SPOILER The Funniest part by far was when James Franco was arguing with Danny Mcbride about cumming in his magazine.

","I Like Seth Rogen. I like half of the rest of the cast enough to give this a shot. I really wanted to like this movie. But lets be honest... If you are over 14 years old (and the movie is rated R), the penis, sex, excreting, and drug-taking jokes just wear thin.<br/><br/>I actually like raunchy, 'toilet' humor when it accents and peppers a movie and it's relatively unexpected. But when the entire movie is based on it, it makes the whole movie tiring after about a half hour. That's the ENTIRE movie. One big, long, boring pot-smoking penis joke.<br/><br/>I did laugh, even out loud, a few times. That's how they got one of the 2 stars out of me. One star's worth of laughs does not make a good movie. The other star was for the creative way they let the audience play a 'guess the Hollywood Star' game through most of the movie with cameo appearances. That was somewhat entertaining. But there was literally NO PLOT. It was obvious the entire cast was making stuff up as they went along and nothing got edited. Several of the bad bantering seemed endless.<br/><br/>This entire movie could have been done in a one-hour HBO special. It's two-hour length was over an hour too long to run the same joke. But, then Hollywood would not have made the $100 million they did off of this mess. People keep showing up, so they'll keep shoveling it out. It was painful to sit through. I figured with the people who are in it and the good reviews it got, that it had to get better. So I sat until the end and I shouldn't have. It had two good laughs at the end with some cameo appearances that made me laugh. But the agony I had to go through to get there was not worth the time nor brain cells it cost me.

"chris-949-613880","Null","14","30","9 July 2013"," Comedy of the year... so far
","There's one scene in This Is the End, where James Franco and Danny McBride arguing, when I snorted from laughing so hard.<br/><br/>Even though it's embarrassing, it's been a long time since I've literally laughed out loud at the movies. Actually, it's been a long time since there's been a laugh-out-loud comedy at all – the last one was probably The Hangover.<br/><br/>This Is the End is so utterly ridiculous and completely insane that it's borderline genius. Similar to the best bits of Anchorman, there are moments here when you're thinking ""What the heck is going on?"", but due to the likability of the actors involved and the fact that they're just having fun with it, makes it you laugh even more.<br/><br/>This film is like an inside joke with some of Hollywood's biggest actors, and while watching it you feel like you're in on it. It feels more like you're laughing with them instead of at them. It's the same kind of thing you would make with your own friends at home, and I guess that's the film's biggest appeal.<br/><br/>And just like Anchorman, it's also really hard to pick your favorite actor or favorite line, because there's just too many to choose from. Each brings their own spin on themselves, with Franco, McBride, Jonah Hill, Craig Robinson, Seth Rogen and Jay Baruchel adopting fictional and overly-exaggerated persona.<br/><br/>Even cameo stars take the mickey out of themselves, and there is a boat-load of cameos. Nearly all members of the Apatow family are accounted for, with Jason Segel, Mindy Kaling, Paul Rudd, Christopher Mintz- Plasse, Aziz Ansari and Michael Cera (who is hilarious), but then there's some big names like Emma Watson, pop star Rihanna and Channing Tatum showing a knack for comedy.<br/><br/>The concept originally started as a short film, also written by Rogen and Evan Goldberg, called Jay and Seth versus the Apocalypse. Jay and Seth remain the main characters here, which is why they're basically ""the straight guys"" in amidst all the weird stuff that's going on.<br/><br/>James Franco is making me dislike him less and less these days, to the point he's actually one of the best things about this film. I think it's just all the other self-absorbed, artsy stuff that makes me want to punch him in his smug face. If he stuck to stoner comedies like this and Pineapple Express I would probably love him.<br/><br/>As for the rest of them, this just made me like 'em even more. Jonah Hill is almost cringe-worthy as an over-the-top phony, who at one point starts a prayer with ""Dear God, it's me Jonah Hill from Moneyball"", Craig Robinson has some of the best one-liners, like ""I'd be pretty bummed if I don't at least get a bight of the Milky Way"", and even though Danny McBride is playing his usual selfish-jerk role, he has never been better.<br/><br/>And even though it sounds stupid, the only thing that will turn some people off is the whole ""apocalypse"" thing – with all the demons and what-not. You could tell from the start that it was going to get a bit crazy toward the end, but I think they rescued it with a bizarre ending that seems perfectly fitting.<br/><br/>It's early in the race, especially with Anchorman 2 and The World's End still to come, but so far this is front-runner for comedy of the year. Definitely worth watching."

He's kind of playing Kenny Powers here, but that's fine with me. They give him an epic entrance and a great send off, and that's what more movies need to do: show respect to McBride.

","I had higher hopes with a great line up of comedy actors but it was tasteless, pointless and lacking in consistent humour throughout. Perhaps this is better suited to a lesser evolved taste in comedy, but normally being a fan of Seth Rogan and a number of the other actors in this, I'm personally really disappointed with this performance. This film has no real story throughout other than loosely following the biblical apocalypse. There are some places where it did manage a chuckle from my wife and me, but typically we spent the film periodically looking at the bemused expression of the other; thoroughly disappointed with both the storyline of the film, but also the normally over-judgemental users of IMDb who actually rated better films than this much lower. My advice to the actors in this film who tried to contribute to the production and writing of the film; stick with acting lads - because the script is is so bad I wouldn't use it for toilet paper."

Almost just as crass, almost just as offensive, almost just as bad, definitely similarly overrated. I was never angrier after leaving a theater than I was when seeing Bruno about which I complained often about wanting my money back, but I was similarly upset about wasting my time on this movie. Where does one start? To start, it's not a movie. It's some kind of experiment, semi-reality based, semi-scripted. The weak plot takes a back seat to the crass, offensive, juevenile dialogue. There is so much time spent on hearing characters rant about their bodily functions you forget that they are supposed to be in the middle of the apocalypse. When the plot does take center stage, it's clear the whole movie is just as an excuse for the writer (Seth Rogen?) to show off his black book of Hollywood friends. In fact the whole experiment seems to just be an excuse for cameos from random celebrities.<br/><br/>Laughs were few and had I not had such high hopes for this film based on the misleadingly high reviews, I would have walked out.

","I was afraid that I was going to be the only reviewer to pan this film, judging by the critical praise and an 8.1 among IMDb voters to date. But thankfully, many others shared my disappointment. While there were some good lines and funny moments, once the Apocalypse scenes began, most of the film degenerated into loud, frenetic yelling and shouting post adolescent locker room vulgarities, while CGI monsters occasionally threatened the cast. The idea of having all the actors portray themselves was terrific. If only the script had made better use of the original plot. While I liked ""Superbad"" and ""Pineapple Express"", though not blown away by either, this was a major disappointment, since I had expected to laugh like in ""Something About Mary"", or ""I Love You, Man"". I would take ""This is 40"" way ahead of this headbanging mess."

The plot is poorly thought out, the lines look like improv and the jokes are crude. There is too little humor and too much gratuitous gore. The acting is also at rehearsal level.

"PassPopcorn","8","11","23","17 September 2013"," Pass the Popcorn review
","This is the End is a comedy movie that gathers some of the biggest  names in modern comedy in an unusual set-up. All of the actors play  themselves (or better, the somewhat alternative versions of themselves)  while they're trying to survive in an end of the world scenario.  Initially, when I heard of this movie and its premise, I thought this  would be yet another lame stoner comedy (with the exception of a good  cast). But, fortunately, I was wrong.  The movie's main character/actor is Jay Baruchel, who visits his old  friend Seth Rogen in Los Angeles. Jay doesn't like the LA lifestyle and  just wants to spend a quiet weekend with Seth smoking pot, playing  video games and slacking off. However, Seth wants the both of them to  go to James Franco's housewarming party. Jay reluctantly accepts Seth's  offer. At the party, the two of them meet some of their old  acquaintances (James Franco, Jonah Hill, Craig Robertson) and also see  some other stars enjoying themselves (like Rihanna, Emma Watson,  Michael Cera). Seth seems to have a good time at the party while Jay is  bored. Eventually, natural disasters start occurring, breaking the  party, killing a bunch of party guests and leaving only six men in the  safety of James Franco's house  Seth Rogen, Jay Baruchel, Craig  Robertson, Jonah Hill, James Franco and Danny McBride.  The thing that caught me by surprise the most in This is the End was  that Jay Baruchel is the movie's protagonist. It was a risky choice to  give the main role to the, arguably, least known actor of the bunch.  Nevertheless, that turned out to be really a good decision, since Jay  has a quite decent acting range and managed to carry the movie even  when it was exploring some issues outside the realms of comedy.  Speaking of this issues, This is the End is much more than a brain-dead  comedy. It also deals with topics like social relationships, human  nature in friendships and the course of growing apart from someone you  hold dear. Of course, none of this makes This is the End a particularly  intelligent movie but it does, however, elevate the movie above your  average everyday modern comedy.  Still, writing about all of this is getting me a little aside from the  main argument  the movie's humour. After all, what is a comedy without  its humour? The humour in This is the End is rather good, I found  myself laughing quite a few times. A large portion of the dialogue in  the movie was ad-libbed, which was great, since the majority of the  actors in the movie are experienced comedians and this way they managed  to show off their skills. All in all, This is the End is worth  watching, and not for the laugh value alone. The only bad thing I can  say about this movie is that towards the end it gets a little too  cheesy and predictable, but I'm pretty sure some people will consider  this discontent as pure nitpicking. Either way, I think it's safe to  say that This is the End is a movie that will satisfy many and  disappoint only a rare few.  Rating: 8/10"

In the end, we have a mediocre story line which simply scares those who just want to see a good comedy, while appealing to gore graphic images that may perhaps excite bored teenagers. The cast is good as usual, but they do not sustain interest. The intellectual level of the directors could certainly have maintained interest without having to resort to cheap frights during the movie.

Granted, they're good script- writers and generally have track of what's funny and what is not - but the question is whether they can control the fun? NO is the answer, unfortunately.<br/><br/>I will admit that it started out good and I thought that if it just continues to build it from there it can only be good. I was, however, horribly wrong.<br/><br/>The film is crowded with stupid overly silly over-the-top sexually explicit scenes, which also run longer than what I thought was ever possible in a movie. There is several over-long almost boring scenes where adults talk about semen, masturbation and rape in very immature ways. Things which are not even funny at the first sentence, is driven out to a three or five minute long scene. How do people find this funny? Well, Americans will hate me for this and probably stop reading after this, but 'typical stupid sex-filled American humor' is what it is.<br/><br/>The film did have its highs but most defiantly also its lows.

I figured, even if it only hit on a few notes, it would be entertaining at the 1 hr mark, we finally had enough. This movie is a nauseating bromantic drama pretending to be a comedy.

","Wow. Who knew the End of Days would be filled with giant sinkholes, oversexed demons, the proliferation of the ""F"" word and a cameo appearance by the Backstreet Boys bathed in a thick haze of burnt high-grade weed? <br/><br/>And who knew how the final judgment would affect a group of young comic actors, including James Franco (""127 Hours""), Jonah Hill (""21 Jump Street""), Seth Rogen (""The Guilt Trip""), Jay Baruchel (""The Sorcerer's Apprentice""), Craig Robinson (""The Office"" TV series) and Danny McBride (""Your Highness"")? Based on a concept created by co-director Rogen (along with Evan Goldberg, both of whom also co-wrote) and Baruchel from 2010, ""This Is the End"" features the cast playing themselves at a housewarming party for Franco.<br/><br/>At it a dozen or so more recognizable celebrities also appear, such as Emma Watson (most recently, ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower""), Michael Cera (""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World""), Mindy Kaling (also from ""The Office"" TV series), Channing Tatum (""G.I. Joe: Retaliation""), Paul Rudd (""Wanderlust""), Rihanna, Jason Segel (""The Five-Year Engagement"") and Christopher Mintz-Plasse (""Movie 43""), among others.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the festivities don't last very long though and most of the party-goers are dispatched quickly as earthquakes, explosions, massive sinkholes and firestorms strike the Hollywood hills wiping out most of the population not suddenly taken to Heaven in radiant blue steaks of light.<br/><br/>Left to their own devices, the five barricade themselves inside and try to come to grips with what's going on. Baruchel, in his infinite wisdom, comes to an early conclusion that this is the Apocalypse and if they will turn to God, they will be saved and instantly ascend into Paradise. The others don't quite agree, so there are various scenes of panic, fear, fighting, backstabbing, drug abuse and demonic possession during the bulk of this end-of-world sleepover (some situations more humorous than others).<br/><br/>Watson, after disappearing during the initial craziness, returns in a very funny sequence (although fans of her Hermione character might have some trouble accepting her dropping the ""F"" bomb several times), while Michael Cera plays a coked-up, obnoxious jerk (far removed from his real-life persona).<br/><br/>Also, the jokes come fast and furious, many laced with profanity (obviously), often self-depreciating and referencing and insulting the films made by the cast (""Pineapple Express,"" ""Superbad,"" ""Moneyball,"" etc.).<br/><br/>These illicit some genuine guffaws, but the longer ""This Is the End"" plays (and it plays two hours — far too long for a comedy), the more violent, weird and less humorous it becomes, until it finally concludes in a heaven-like atmosphere straight out of ""Monty Python's The Meaning of Life."" <br/><br/>Of course, when a film is dealing with the end of the world, there is not a lot of wiggle room and even in this current age of motion picture excess, the fire-scorched landscapes, smoke-filled atmosphere and 200-foot ""Cloverfield"" monstrosities seem way over the top. A message of biblical salvation, however, is certainly an interesting addition particularly in light of current feelings toward Christianity in Hollywood and especially in a movie like this.<br/><br/>Despite the ad libbing and improvisation, there is a semblance of a plot, with Baruchel and Rogen being childhood friends from Canada trying to reconnect, while Hill is attempting to just make a basic connection with the introverted Baruchel. Meanwhile, McBride arrives later to become a major thorn, eating most of their spare food and wasting much of their water.<br/><br/>It's not always snicker out loud (like last year's ""Ted"") nor is it a Billy Wilder masterpiece of wry and wit, but overall — after months of complaining about the definite dearth of comedies — this author has to admit that while ""This Is the End"" is not perfect, it is certainly funny, for the most part. And even though the laughs become fewer and fewer as the movie goes along, there are more than enough to give this comedy a slightly hearty recommendation."

I will admit I laughed so hard, there were tears. It didn't seem like it was trying too hard, it flowed well and was as ridiculous as I expected it to be. <br/><br/>Cinematically, this movie did something that I've never really seen done before. I've seen plenty of actors ""play themselves"" so to speak, but usually the role is small and insignificant. This movies shines for that choice – to have all the actors play (funny, fictionalized versions of) themselves. I thought the story/writing very funny and well paced. As I said, not for everyone, but it had me laughing for sure. I liked the choices of music used (for the most part), one part in the end really had me (and the entire theater) in stitches. <br/><br/>Overall I thought it was very funny, but like I said not for everyone.

The story was okay, nothing out of the ordinary for an apocalyptic kind of movie but the actors could have done a better job. They each gave off this weird persona(even though they were acting as themselves in the film)that seemed wonky.

","I do not write review since a while, I have lost the wish for that, observing how in our times of human desolation anybody can say anything online.<br/><br/>But this film shocked me deeply for its stupidity and the unbearable amount of the most unsympathetic actors of the world, all together. It's like an overdose of negative vibrations and left me disgusted. Specially Jay Baruchel and Jonah Hill, how is it possible that these two things are allowed to appear publicly? How can anybody tolerate the sound of the voice of this Jay, and their faces, holy saints, how can this be happening in Hollywood? So I had to say this: if you feel, like I did, that you are not going to like this movie, don't test your intuition, trust it! It's warning you of a basic truth: this movie is horrible. The promised ""many actors together"", which would have saved the movie from this desolation, is a fake, a scam. It's only at the beginning and it's hugely disappointing. Then we are left with a branch of annoying brats who think they are actors. Only presence which brings some positivity is Emma. Franco is no more than ""just OK"", far from his best, just he there, sometimes even annoying in his hyper-realistic Jamesness. But better he than another brat. And Seth is far from my favourite actor, I never liked him. But compared to Baruchel he is God.<br/><br/>Long desolating dialogues, scenes where nothing happens, actors who think that acting natural means being themselves on screen. Mistake. . Only a few moments where you vaguely smile. If this is your aim, you have your movie."

The storyline was also weak. <br/><br/>I think the producers wanted to emulate ""Zombieland"" or ""Shaun of the Dead"" with limited gore and a horror-story-feel with humor. They failed. It also doesn't imitate ""Pineapple Express"" in that it's a good getting high movie. A person cannot smoke the amount of weed it would take to enjoy this.

"nlytnd_1","3","8","17","6 October 2013"," Misleading Trailers! Bad Directing, characters lacked authenticity!
","They definitely tried to make a good film and I'm sure this was a fun movie to make, but it unfortunately fails. Bummed I was looking forward to this movie! The only reason why I give this a 3 instead of a 1 is Danny McBride's performance. It's one of those movies where you know it sucks early on and there's nothing it could do to redeem itself. If there was a way to calculate how many people walked out of the theater, I have little doubt this would hold the all-time record. It's because of the style, which I would imagine lays blame mostly on the directors. <br/><br/>I liked the trailers, because it made the movie seem as though it was going to have that element of authenticity/realism with the characters, while being a far-fetched comedy, but the character style is beyond over the top stupid. Here's a thought, why not just make the movie the way you want to present the movie in the trailer? If it wasn't for the trailer I would have thought that they intended to make what they ended up with. A stupid comedy can work if it has an element of authenticity in the characters a decent portion of the time. This movie starts off like it could be that way, but early on the characters just... oy vey!!! Which BTW, has nothing to do with the story transitioning into craziness, but that's about the time when the characters turn over the top stupid. The whole, ""playing themselves"", was totally for marketing this movie (technically they used their real names). Even if the actors played over the top far-fetched versions of themselves this movie probably would have been good.<br/><br/>It's generally true that comedy works when you have that certain element of authenticity in the characters (to varying degrees). With the exception of Airplane, Naked Gun and Spaceballs, which has the intentions to be stupid on stupid throughout, although those worked, generally they don't, like this movie. This may seem like random movie drops, but it's a rip on the degree of the stupid on stupid nature of this movie, being that it's much more comparable to those then it is to a movie like Superbad. I loved the movie Superbad, because the characters had that believability. On the other hand if you liked Pineapple Express (which I hated, for the same reasons), you may like this movie, although several reviewers said they liked PExpress and hated this movie). Just to pull another unrelated random comedy out of my butthole; Dumb & Dumber (which I consider a classic) is a movie one may think would fall into my stupid on stupid category, but Lloyd and Harry had a fairly realistic world interacting and operating around them, which was part of the reason their over the top antics had credibility. Nothing against ""This Is the Ends"" crazy world, but they had a lot more flexibility with their characters to achieve such credibility. <br/><br/>There were a handful of scenes that still made me laugh. All of them involved Danny McBride (had no opinion prior, other than two dreadful movies I saw him in, PExpress & Hot Rod). Just about every scene Danny had, he at least did something that gave it a chuckle. Going back to the whole realism thing, Danny has that authenticity/believability (while different, his ability to be believable when being surrounded by and doing far-fetched things reminds me of Zach Galifianakis), which makes his scenes in the movie funny that few others with the same lines could pull off. This dude has talent; he needs to be cast in some leading or significant supporting roles. If McBride's stock isn't soaring yet, I definitely want to buy some. <br/><br/>Spoilers Scene - everyone wakes up and they give Danny the spiel about all the crazy things that happened. He then proceeds to give this logical breakdown that they were tripping on Acid and goes down the list of people based on their appearance. Hilarious! It actually made me question it, until the head falls off. Scene - the sticky magazine scene. Danny should win some type of academy award for that scene. Seriously! Franco also does a good job. There's one point where Seth Rogan is busting up, so they cut to a back shot and you can totally tell he's laughing. The Pilgrim line particularly cracked me up. Scene – A subtle line, but it caused me to laugh the hardest. The part after Danny drinks the water, Grabs Franco's gun and puts it in his mouth, takes it out and pushes Franco's arm down, ""That's what I thought nerd."" It's not funny in writing, but it's my favorite part in practice. Scene – I went back through and virtually every scene with McBride, he does something that's at least subtly funny. The whole Emma Watson incidental rape discussion scene is funny on paper, which turned out semi funny in practice, but it's Danny's sincerity throughout that makes it funny. Then up in the interview room when he says, Herminey took are crap (it's the way he says it) good stuff! There are a couple other scenes as well. <br/><br/>I like virtually every actor that's in this movie in general. Jonah Hill is one of my favorite actors (his role in this sucked). I don't understand why directors don't get it. Perhaps they strive for character authenticity and they turn out stupid, or maybe it's something that's difficult to achieve (I don't know I'm not a director)? I really hope it's not by choice. Sure there are people out there that like stupid on stupid, but there are far more people out there that like some element of realism in the characters with their stupid and you won't even lose the stupid on stupid crowd as a fan base, so in the end it seems like a win win."

What a shame, then, that the on-screen 'talent' involved are—in my humble opinion—amongst the most over-rated performers in Hollywood today, making this a virtually joyless experience for yours truly and anyone else who has ever suffered through a Seth Rogan film and been left wondering how he, and his regular co-stars, came to be quite so successful.<br/><br/>According to the trivia section here on IMDb, about 50% of the film was ad-libbed, and it really feels like it, opening with a full 15 minutes of utterly inane chit-chat between undeservedly over-privileged stoners Rogen and Jay Baruchel that only a fellow partaker of the weed could possibly find funny (but then, when you're high, anything seems funny). The scenes of chaos as the Apocalypse occurs provides some relief from the unscripted drivel, with a few fun deaths for some of the stars (seeing Rhianna fall down a huge chasm to her doom was like a dream come true), but the film soon settles back into puerile garbage mode, the guys discussing each others dicks and ejaculate ad nauseum until the appearance of a couple of well executed CGI demons that sadly fail to rip the obnoxious survivors to bloody ribbons of flesh."

","The plot starts out interesting. As others wrote, it makes you curious how these comedians are going to deal with the situation they soon find themselves in. And what exactly that situations is about. This is were the potential of the movie starts to collapse.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: Soon after the apocalypse begins, the viewers find themselves mostly trapped in the boring, confined setting of the few rooms of a snobbish house. Imagination and wondering are all left outside. And - unlike the ""12 Angry Men"" from 1957 - these characters aren't even curious enough to look.<br/><br/>Rather, they go on each others as well as our own nerves by stepping on each others toes as much as they can, leading them only to stereotypical, immature arguing about completely apocalypse-unrelated things. See other postings for details.<br/><br/>Sure enough they eventually find their way out of that house. Yet only to discover a philosophically completely unchallenging Christian style apocalypse with average cgi.<br/><br/>Once Satan is evaded they finally end up where they were heading for the last 30 minutes of the movie.<br/><br/>Ironically though, the motto of the flicks heaven is ""everything you can imagine is yours"". And since the writers' imaginations do not appear to be particularly great, we find ourselves in a heaven-end-scene that is a mix of a Tobacco-Segway-Backstreet Boys commercial.<br/><br/>Pherhaps this movie really is meant to be a drama. But not in that the apocalypse is meant to be terrible for all the demons and deaths it brings, but for bringing those guys together in that house?

","I don't know how any person with half a brain cell could call this a ""hilarious"" movie. This was single-handedly the WORST movie I have ever seen.<br/><br/>I didn't chuckle, giggle, or even so much as smile at ANY point during this movie. The audience, however, was overwhelmingly loud in their cascade of laughter. I just don't get it. I sat there with my arms cross, with a frown on my face, trying to fathom how a bunch of grown adults actually compiled such a mess of a movie.<br/><br/>Jim Carrey is funny. Robin Williams is funny. Jerry Seinfeld is funny. THIS.... was NOT funny. <br/><br/>The fact that people have stated that the ""story had potential"" are just as frustrating to deal with.

None of the actors know how to ""act"". They play themselves in every goddamn movie. A group of guys spending 5 minutes fighting over a Milky Way... a computer-generated demon walking around with his penis showing... topped of by a migraine-inducing ending where The Backstreet Boys appear out of nowhere.<br/><br/>The audience was loving all of this, and they clapped once the credits rolled. I just don't get it!!!<br/><br/>It's almost as if it was a blatant and intentional slap in the face for robbing you of your money.

"ironhorse_iv","7","8","17","6 July 2013"," In the end, it was a pretty good movie. Very smart comedy movie with a little bit of stupidity.
","First let me say, I actually like this funny movie, even with the stupid crude college frat boy humor. It's one of the smartest comedies, these actors have even done. It had some depth, and make light into a lot of post-apocalypse social issues. The movie is based on a short comedy film written by writer-actors Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg, and director Jason Stone called 'Jay and Seth versus the Apocalypse'. When the trailer for the short film hit YouTube in 2007, it got over 50,000 hits in the first two weeks. Thus, 'This is the End' was green light to be made. I love the fact, that 'This is the End' has a self-reference, Charles Kaufman type feel to the film. The film has the real life actors portraying fictional version of themselves in a fictional end of the world story. Most of them played it completely straight and in doing so they've get the best comedy that's come out in a long time. Surprising Michael Cera playing this version of Michael Cera was the best thing for his career. It was pretty new to see him in this type of a role, even if it was short. Some of the celebs cameos were just way too short. I just wish, Kevin Hart and Jason Segal had a bigger role. I glad, Rhianna had a smaller role. She can't act, best to keep her role to a cameo otherwise it would ruin the vibe of the movie. There was also a very secret cameo in the Cannibalism scene worth checking out. Most of the main cast did a great job. Danny McBride pretty much made the movie, watchable. Craig Robinson and Seth Rogen was probably the most love character in the film. The other characters were a bit unlikable. I just couldn't stand Jay Baruchel in this movie at all. I felt the role that Jonah Hill got, didn't suite his personality. I don't know how they act around people in real life, but it was pretty interesting seeing them play the closest thing to just being themselves. Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen combined real characteristics of the actors who then produced bizarre alt-version of themselves with elements that had absolutely nothing in common with the cast. Every main cast member took the director aside and told him that they couldn't do what he was asking him to because it was going too far and getting too extreme besides James Franco. So I doubt they were really horrible people in real life. The movie push the boundaries of humor to the extremes with over the top shock value scenes with serious issues like rape and cannibalism. What other comedy movie could make a serious issue such as 'rape' seem a little bit funny? There were some limits to the humor. James Franco asked Director Seth Rogen if his brother, Dave, could have a part. Rogen decided not to have the family of its main stars, brothers & sisters, mothers & fathers, girlfriends & wives in the movie because those people would have been most likely killed off in the movie causing it to become too dark. The movie starts out with all the actors hanging out at James Franco's house for a party, when the apocalypse hits. The chaos has forced the men to take shelter and try to survive in this new world. Slowly, the men are forced to take the apocalypse serious, and look closer into their own life, and ask themselves did they live a righteous enough to go to heaven. I was surprised at the religiousness of it all. This movie might offended some Christians and Atheisms with its biblical overtones, but I just say 'lighten up', it's just a movie. It does make the movie a little bit preachy for my taste in some areas. Still in the end, the movie says that acting stupid, mean-spirited, one-dimensional, offensive, and retarded man child, just show that in the end, doesn't help you in the apocalypse. Some audience members will be a bit angry that their famous celebs end up biting the dust. I just say, don't worry, you're favorite celeb didn't die in real life. I do like the CGI in the film. It was pretty high tech. The demons really look scary. The jokes here are hit and miss. Some of the jokes in the film got tiresome. Too much cuss words, gross out humor, sexual content, and racial humor was just as one-dimensional as ever. It wasn't ground breaking humor. I did like the parodies and satires here to both Hollywood and religionists lifestyles. I thought the Drug Humor was just awful. Because of those, I did leave the theater with mixed feelings. It wasn't impressive. It felt like a mediocre version of pretty bad modern comedies. In my opinion, this movie was just a better version of 2010's Grown Ups. I did like the funny homemade Pineapple Express 2 film. According to Rogen and Goldberg, the homemade Pineapple Express 2 film in which this movie depicts is what they envision for the actual sequel. So maybe we will see a real version of that one day. Overall: great movie, just not that great."

","--WARNING: There are some spoilers ahead for those who haven't seen the film, so just a heads up. In order to accurately review this film, it may be necessary to talk about some key moments.--<br/><br/>I really didn't want to go into this movie ready to dislike it, however, I quickly had that uncomfortable -this is going to go to a bad place fast- vibe, that obviously I should've had, but it didn't cushion the blow at all for what is perhaps the Rogen gangs worst effort to date. Reason for being uncomfortable? Well, that feeling didn't come from the apocalypse itself, but rather from just how quickly it was evident that this movie was going to be bad from start to finish. <br/><br/>I read before hand that this movie had gotten rave reviews, I also knew from the trailer I watched for it that I was going to be really confused as to why. It didn't look impressive in the slightest, and the humor seemed dated and more depressive rather than funny.<br/><br/>So I had every reason to be concerned that I would waste an hour and a half of my time if I sat down to watch it, but my curiosity eventually got the best of me and I rented it, and...well, basically this movie is a joke. Jay returns to L.A to visit Seth and gets invited over to James Franco's house for a party, and the rapture happens...that's about all the story you need, it stops there. There are shades of a story, a shadow here and there perhaps, an attempt at a narrative of sorts, but more or less just a bunch of ideas and jokes strung together to make this appear like a movie rather than a singular, and mostly boring event. Sad part is the joke seems to be on the movie rather than the audience. For one thing, the Apatow gang, even with Apatow absent and Rogen at the helm, couldn't save this from being a flat out bad idea for a feature film. <br/><br/>It mocks everything it shamelessly plugs at the same time: Emma Watson has the biggest cameo and she just happens to have a new movie called ""The Bling Ring"" coming out around the same time, spoofing apocalyptic films, which are a dime a dozen these days, and lastly, the musical number at the end with the Backstreet Boys couldn't have been a more blatant plug for their reunion tour this year.<br/><br/>The reliance on repetition of words during joke segments as well as jokes that most of us have already heard a variant of in other films with the same cast makes this feel like a very forced and by the numbers film that aims to give the audience everything it has already had more than enough of. Bro-mances have been declining in quality for years now, and This is the End showcases exactly why that is...if you go for more dirty and more vulgar to 1-up each previous film, rather than more creative and witty, eventually you'll just end up looking foolish rather than artistic. I know, taste is subject, but still, it doesn't help as much as it hurts after a while in my book. Not to mention any movie that makes Michael Cera the exact opposite of who he actually is, then casts him as himself and actually thinks it would be funny for the brief twenty minutes he's present in the film for, does not have the audience in mind. <br/><br/>Casting everyone to play themselves is about the only unique thing about this film...yet at the same time, that's kind of the exact opposite of original. It's some bizarre meta-fictional trip that's logic seems more geared towards those who don't really think about it that much rather than grounded by any sort of good idea. Why play yourself if you're really not playing yourself?<br/><br/>In the end, This is the End cannot end quick enough, as it's basically an opportunity for a bunch of friends to make a movie and not care about anything they put into it. It's no Superbad, or Forgetting Sarah Marshall, nor I Love You, Man...It's really sadly not anything that a true fan of this trope would actually enjoy watching. <br/><br/>So unless you're really serious about your commitment to Rogen films, or just happen to love low brow at it's raunchiest and most anti- appropriate, avoid this stinker."

The rule in football (for US citizen I mean soccer) that not every player makes a good manager applies in this case - not every actor makes a good director. Actually the ""horror"" part was the script, there was no comedy so I can't critise that and there were only three good parts in the movie - Rianna's death, Emma Watson wielding an axe and the fact that the movie ended. In my eyes this movie was a bad combination of Meet the Spartans, Fat Pizza, Harold and Kumar and Scary Movie. What makes it worse than the other four movies is that they are unique in their stupidity and this one was dumb when it was written and then took different stupid elements from Meet the Spartans, Fat Pizza, Harold and Kumar and Scary Movie!<br/><br/>P.S. - Mr. Rogen stick to acting.

","The concept was simple enough. All the big A list comedy stars group together and go to a huge party in the house (or fortress) of James Franco, just before the apocalypse erupts. All playing themselves, Seth Rogen, James Franco, Jonah Hill, Jay Baruchel, Danny McBride, and Craig Robinson, survive the first stage of the end of the world and seclude themselves safely within the walls of Franco's house, and from that moment on the movie goes from one mistake to the next, which just makes you wonder:<br/><br/>Have these guys run out of comedic ideas?<br/><br/>When you look at the credits given in This Is The End, you really would expect more from these guys. Seth Rogen, hilarious in Knocked Up, Green Hornet and Paul. Jonah Hill in 21 Jump Street and Super Bad ( a minor plus in the film is seeing the Super Bad trio reunited), Craig Robinson in Hot Tub Time Machine (although he is one of the funniest of the cast) and James Franco has done enough to show his acting talents in the past. The problem with This Is The End is that it all feels like they're just re-treading old material, whether it be masturbation gags, male genitalia jokes and pornography references, and, of course, ""funny"" clips involving dope smoking. (It wasn't funny in Pineapple Express, and it isn't here either). <br/><br/>It all just seems so forced and more like a private joke between the cast members, and as the film ""progresses"" the jokes become all the more stale. I really went into This Is The End with high expectations, and I sat there hoping to find it more amusing, but the truth of it all is I just got really, really bored. Throughout the decapitated heads, jizzed up magazines, cannibalism, and a mildly funny parody of The Exorcist, the film reaches it's much awaited ending, and we are given the cringe worthy sight of giant devil testicles as the it comes to Earth to claim the last survivors. And then, when the last scene finally ends, the cinema falls quiet and the credits roll. <br/><br/>And it's a real shame. These guys have shown in the past that they can be funny, and whilst this film does deliver the occasional few laughs, they are short lived and then forgotten. Although, on a more positive note, whoever came up with the idea of a douche bag Michael Cera (as seen in the trailers) on cocaine that nobody likes was probably the funniest aspect to film amongst it's stupidity. So props to that guy.<br/><br/>My Verdict: An overlong, boring journey following Hollywood's best in the midst of the apocalypse with few highlights. If anything, it's just disappointing."

Between Danny and everyone else. <br/><br/>Plus I love that they played with the end of the world, and judgement day. I love that they went religious. It brought a kind of I want to say realness to it for me. It plays with something people actually believe. This is the End isn't just a random title for a movie. It's actually saying what it is. <br/><br/>The visuals of the demons, and especially Satan in the end were amazing. The last shot especially, had me in awe.

The dialog is as explicit and raunchy as an X-rated movie sans the actual women, sex and nudity.<br/><br/>""The End"" is highly recommended for folks that enjoy drug-related humor as much of the content is based on that.<br/><br/>The movie is a light hearted horror movie that does well at self-deprecation and pokes fun at itself.

","Wow, my wife and I thought this movie was horrendously bad. It was the worst movie we have seen this year with no other close competition. Imagine a home movie that a middle schooler would make and add a little CGI and a lot of vulgarity. It was mind-numbingly boring, idiotic, and crude. So many of the scenes were just filler that could easily have been cut out. To us it was amateurish and self-indulgent. The actors, who play themselves, were so obnoxious that it makes you never want to see a movie again with them in it, especially Michael Cera. We watched for 50 minutes, which seemed like 2 hours of torture, and then walked out. I can't even recommend this movie to people who liked Pineapple Express. I liked Pineapple Express myself, but if that was a B+ movie, then this one is an F-. How the heck did this get a Rotten Tomatoes rating of 84%? Were they watching the same movie? I would advise reading the ""hated it"" reviews on this site before you spend money on a ticket."

"Jonkay3","1","13","32","22 June 2013"," Terrible, vile film
","This alleged comedy relies heavily on the shock value of certain words (s—t, f—k, r-p-) and their associated actions. There's not much else. It is a vile film with little or no redeeming value and even less humor if by that you mean subtlety and wit.<br/><br/>The film begins with two men discussing healthy eating and bodily cleansing. An eight year old would love how they use the adult equivalent of the ""poop"" word in almost every sentence. They are then shown eating fast food at a drive thru; this passes for a sight gag.<br/><br/>Later six supposedly adult men – all self professed celebrities who should know better -- are stranded alone in a large house after a party (fellatio included) which is followed by an earthquake that devastates the city. The action revolves around survival but focuses on, among other things, masturbation including a long dissertation about who can shoot further between two shouters (one on a balcony and one below like Romeo and Juliet, get it?), homosexual rape (shown mercifully as shadows on the wall), heterosexual rape (the six ""comics"" verbally draw straws for a lone woman who ventures in seeking shelter until she reappears with an axe and decapitates a phallic sculpture; they wisely let her go), and other such antics. There's even a full frontal masturbation with the action mercifully below screen but the output on screen. One comic (if that's the right word) wears throughout the film a T-shirt with the large printed legend ""Take Yo Panties OFF!!!"". And we are treated to this profanity throughout the entire film; there's no relief. <br/><br/>If you are a teenager just learning about sex and words best left unspoken this film is for you. Otherwise, stay away."

","Why isn't Jay Baruchel in more things?! Well, more relevant things. I mean ""Goon"" was a really good movie, but how many people saw that? The writing team that brought you ""Superbad"", Seth Rogen and the very hit and miss Evan Goldberg, come together once again to write and direct this film. Adapted from a 2007 short by Goldberg, Rogen and Baruchel entitled Jay and Seth Versus the Apocalypse, ""This Is the End"" has one of the most simplistically brilliant plot lines in film history. Basically, Rogen, Baruchel and every other comedic actor you can think of (all playing themselves) attend a party at James Franco's houseand then the world ends. This plays out like an elongated Funny or Die skit. The only difference being that ""This Is the End"" is consistently funny.<br/><br/>There is actually a subplot dealing with Rogan and Baruchel growing apart as friends which works really well (in ""Superbad""-esque fashion) only because of the construction of the script and some rather genuine chemistry from its two leads. And can I take a minute to talk about how well this film looks for being both Rogen and Goldberg's directorial debuts? I mean, aside from the onslaught of funny one-liners, this end-of-days film looks like a million bucks (in a good way). Even when some of the CGI does slip into a cartoonish realm, like seasoned vets, Rogen and Goldberg maintain the tonal atmosphere befitting each scene; be it a high octane chase sequence or a few well placed dance sequences.<br/><br/>Side Note: When I say everybody is in this movie, I do mean EVERYBODY. But the cameo that clearly steals the show is from Michael Cera in his most outlandishly crass and hilarious role ever; a performance that is almost worth the price of admission alone. Trust me. If you weren't a Cera fan before, which is supremely understandable with him being the most annoying kind of Canadian and all, then you will be after this.<br/><br/>""This Is the End"" is what every person paying $11 for their movie ticket should expect, but rarely gets from a modern comedy. It's not only an adult comedy that actually contains non-stop laughs for a change, but ""This Is the End"" is the funniest movie since ""40 Year Old Virgin"". This also is a much needed return to comedic form for Rogan and to a lesser extent Jonah Hill (only because ""21 Jump Street"" was pretty funny) and clearly is the funniest movie the rest of this cast has been a part of by far. Hell, even Danny McBride is hilarious here. And we all know how much I hate Danny McBride.<br/><br/>Final Thought: There are so many memorable one-liners in this movie, it is sure to become an instant comedy classic. And why most of these jokes work is because they are so self-deprecating. Yes, THIS IS about 20 minutes too long and it is essentially a movie full of phallic and weed tangents, but when it comes right down to it ""This Is the End"" is a comedy which contains very few bits that don't work (mostly coming near the end) and is drowned in laugh out loud moments from minute one, to a finale that blows the one in ""Bridesmaids"" right out of the water. I hate to constantly pick on ""Bridesmaids"" (well, hate is such a strong word) but Kristen Wiig and crew should really take note on how a real comedy like ""This Is the End"" constructs a final sequence. I'm just saying."
"db-beurylaw","1","28","80","15 June 2013"," If you like latent homosexuality, vulgar language and this turds for you
","I hated this movie. As Roger Ebert once said, Hated it, hated it hated it. I expected to hate it, it was supposed to be like Pineapple Express, which is a terrible movie. I was stuck waiting for a Megabus and had 3 hours to kill and happened to be right in front of a movie theater. I thought the theater experience would show my what all the stoners are raving about. It didn't help. What surprised me is the latent homosexuality. All six of the actors play themselves and they are all hot for each other. The previews feature Emma Watson. Ms Watson is in the movie for about one minute before they run her off. Then its just 6 men with their hilarious bantor of their desire for each other, creative ways of using the word ""fuck"" in every sentence and how they are lusting for drugs. It reminded me of a horrible fraternity party I once went to where none of the women showed up. The boys got drunk and screamed about how they should such each others dicks. The movie starts off with Seth Rogan and Jay Baruchel playing themselves. Rogan wants to go to James Franco's house. Baruchel is whining that Rogan wont pay attention to him there and he doesn't want to share him with Franco. Really! Once they get there, Franco has two large paintings, he created, one with Rogan's name and the other Franco's. Could it get more gay? Baruchel then pulls Rogan away cause he can't go get a pack of cigerettes himself. (Acting like teenage girls) While there, apparently Aramgedden begins. They go back to Franco's house where six men are holed trying to figure out how to divvy up the drugs and one Milky Way.<br/><br/>If there was something funny here, I didn't see it. My old fraternity brothers were way funnier. What is disconcerting about this comedy and several other comedies of late is that they have all male casts. (Tropic Thunder, Hangover movies, The Interns, etc.) It all frat boy all the time. But as a former frat boy, I can tell you that we weren't latent homosexuals. Is Hollywood trying to send us a subliminal message? Gotta say that I am a liberal who totally supports gay rights (marriage, employment, all civil rights). I don't dislike gays, I just don't want that to be the theme of every movie. <br/><br/>I notice that another comedy this summer is ""The Heat"" which is just women (Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy). Is the Taliban supervising how movies are made? Its either all men or all women. The sexes don't mingle. No movie should be all male or all female unless its about a submarine or prison. As someone said on Twitter, ""This is the End is close to gay porn."

","""This is embarrassing.""<br/><br/>In a mood for a movie and not for another adaptation of a disappointing franchise (Superman), I decided to go see This Is the End. I had the expectation that the movie would provide numerous laughs based on its surprisingly positive ratings. Based on Seth Rogen's previous movies, I guess it was wrong to believe so. This Is the End houses an empty plot filled with over-the-top vulgarity that is seemingly supposed to make viewers laugh rather than be disturbed and confused. And again, it was my fault to even hope that a Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg movie was going to be good, or even funny.<br/><br/>The film starts off with an interesting and new premise: Hollywood actors/comedians playing their fictional selves in an apocalypse. While the main cast consist of Jay Baruchel, Seth Rogen, James Franco, Craig Robinson, Jonah Hill, and Danny McBride, there are many cameos throughout the movie, including Emma Watson and Michael Cera. Michael Cera steals the spotlight in the beginning with his horny and drug addicted awkwardness. While his parts are the funniest scenes in the film, sadly, he is one of the first to go. For the rest of the hour and a half, the film attempts to make rape jokes, regurgitation, and excessive masturbation into something humorous. The film has potential, but definitely ends up as a hit and miss. I was surprised to find other viewers laughing their heads off when someone on screen had their own head chopped off and kicked around. But then again, they were mainly obnoxious high school students. It just goes to show the level of stupidity and maturity that the movie has.<br/><br/>The film tries to focus on Seth and Jay's shaky friendship. But the movie is careless with its story, paying more attention to the cast getting high with Psy's international hit playing in the background. So it's obviously safe to say that the film lacks any sort of real story and is just a narcissistic display of actors ridiculing themselves for creepy and cheap laughs.<br/><br/>I couldn't help but feel embarrassed for watching such a horrific attempt at comedy.

I didn't even know Rihanna was in it until I checked on here. If they had used Channing Tatum for more than 5 seconds this film may have actually been funny.

","By far the funniest movie of 2013. There are a lot of very good lines that made me and my two friends laugh really hard at. Some of the things are just so weird that it's funny, but the movie is just something to watch for fun and laugh at. Some jokes were penis/sex/drug related, but it was genuinely funny, not some 10 year old's joke. Some jokes were predictable, but most were just so incredibly surprising that no one would've thought of it. The laughs start at the very beginning, and they do not stop until the end. I thought it was going to be the common parody film that uses sex as its tag line, but this movie went way beyond my expectations. Everyone in the movie was so good and funny, and I am definitely going to see this again very soon."

","It is very easy for many writers and directors to think that humor and comedy are an easy subject to work with.

So they make a movie that we supposed to laugh, or better say ""laugh out loud"" with their sense of humor. <br/><br/>Well I have news for them. Their sense of humor lacks of humor. Even if someone becomes more moderate in judging them will say that their sense of humor is made for youngsters that do not exceed the age of ten. Imaturity, stupidity, dominate this parody of reality shows and whatever else is out there only made for brain cell damage. The length of the movie was sweltering and tormenting. As for the end?

And the short film it was based on doesn't provide any more comfort. <br/><br/>When I began to see this movie advertised and I looked into its premise, without assuming it had political ends, I felt there might be more to it than just an attempt at comic relief. The fact that a different very similar one from the UK came out at roughly the same time wasn't reassuring. Granted there are some funny scenes (and I praise Jonah Hill 's performance throughout the movie), the number of celebrities involved despite the budget, the lack of story telling and the way the movie insists on shocking the audience constantly, often with complete disregard for making the audience laugh makes you wonder why it was made in the first place."

However, as soon as the Franco party was parted everything that was meant to be humorous fell to such a level of immaturity all the jokes were 100% predictable drivel. There's some great comedic zombie/apocalyptic movies and what is here is the polar opposite. As a comedy it makes Animal House look like Citizen Cane.

","I am a puritan-born a straight-laced mother-ivy league, clean of mouth, mind and body. I did not expect to like this film, I expected it to be raunchy and frat boy level humor. On 2 out of three, I was correct. It was raunchy, frat boy level humor, but SO much more. And I loved it- I am ashamed to say. Loved it so much I went back again, and might yet again. Here you have debauched genius in the flesh and spirit. These actors masterfully play themselves with such honest realism and also tongue in cheek wit and sarcasm, it defied my expectations. You get to see their flaws in all their vapid childishness and sincerity, along with their sneaky wit and brilliance. This is a deconstructed satire about Hollywood life, full of its juvenile egotism and masquerade's, beautifully and hysterically depicted by people I would have been loathe (until now) to acknowledge as masters of their art. There are running parodies and references of/to other films both classic and not, along with a hilarious belly-button self expose of the California life style. Their ability to make so far-fetched a reality completely believable and even... exciting and fun yet at the same time horribly scary is what kept me hanging on through the darkest (and it got pretty comically dark) of scenes. Never seen damnation and redemption played with such wild, stupid, and brilliant self-abandon. It keeps coming back up on me, like a favorite fair food after a wild roller coaster ride, I can't stop remembering it...."

Franco was never an actor on my top 10 list, but his performance in this movie have given me new found respect for his talents. He put on a great comedic performance. <br/><br/>I can't remember the last time I went to a movie in a theater, where the entire audience was laughing at scenes so loudly, you could barely hear parts of the script.<br/><br/>See this movie!"

The opening series of celebrity cameos gets old rather quickly, but the movie wastes little time getting to the selling point: seeing these six guys (playing douchey versions of themselves) at each other's throats. And it's a novel angle, to be sure. <br/><br/>And the strange factor just continues to ratchet until we get to the ultimate in WTF endings.

This was the first time a seen Jonah Hill act. or this was him being himself and the character he plays in everything else is him 'acting' Even for a cameo they could have utilized Kevin Hart more so. The 'rape' scene just seemed to forced. It was slightly amusing but was not funny and it went on for too long. James Franco was good in this and I don't think I've ever said that about him.

"rneil95","9","7","16","19 June 2013"," So Funny It Hurts!!
","""This Is The End"" is the directorial debut of screen writing duo Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, who also brought us ""Superbad"" and ""Pineapple Express,"" and to be honest, this is their crowning achievement. This movie primarily focuses on a group of comedians trapped in James Franco's house during the apocalypse. Aside from having a great premise as it is, the film's main draw is the fact that all these actors are playing exaggerated versions of themselves, which becomes the basis for some truly laugh-out-loud moments. For the most part, the script is fairly loosely written, which leaves a lot of room for improvisation by the actors. Those improvised sequences are where the film shines, because it creates a sense of camaraderie among the actors which adds a lot to the enjoyment factor. You get a sense that all of these guys are really good buddies just having a good time making this movie, and that's something the film captures really nicely. But above all else, the movie is just plain funny. It is quite often very sophomoric and juvenile, but it never insults the audience's intelligence. For me, every single joke hit hard and made me laugh to a point where my face began to ache! Movies don't get much funnier than this, and the credit really goes to the cast for making this premise work so well. Towards the middle of the film, it starts to feel like it drags, but it picks right up again towards the end that I don't mind. I easily could watch this movie 10 more times, and laugh every single time. I can't recommend this movie enough, I loved ""This Is the End."""

Emma Watson seems to have stooped to a low level in her career for money by being in bad films more than not after the Harry Potters films were done with. What a shame. What a shame all of this is. Seems like talent is not being taken seriously anymore these days. Plus, there were already comedies with exorcisms, apocalypses, famous people going to hell, etc. in South Park that did a better job at black comedy that makes this film look like a regurgitation instead of a classic."

","Wow.<br/><br/>I walked into the movie theater with my friend, expecting just a regular comedy about the end of the world with bad special effects. Boy was I wrong. We both walked out of the theater, laughing, and completely blown away by the execution of the movie. The story is, quite bluntly, Seth Rogen, Jay Bareuchel, James Franco, Danny McBride, Craig Robinson, Jonah Hill are all hunkered down in Franco's new mansion while the apocalypse ensues.<br/><br/>The comedy is great, very consistent and no jokes really fall flat. I was worried for this movie, because each time a comedy is released all of the good jokes are ruined in the trailer to lure people in. Not with this one. If you were a fan of Pineapple Express or Superbad, you will probably love this movie just like I did. Not since ""Ted"" have I genuinely laughed so much while watching a movie at the theater.<br/><br/>Performances are great as well. The idea to just ditch creating new characters and having the actors play themselves made everything twice as funny given the situation, And I have to give credit to Danny McBride for stealing the screen nearly every time he appears, but the interactions supplied by the others really made it perfect. They are not exactly playing themselves, though. They are playing dramatized versions of themselves, for example Michael Cera isn't actually a coke sniffing pervert.<br/><br/>The combination of end of the world/comedy and even some scary/unsettling parts was great and worked for the tone of the movie. For example, there is a scene where a man pokes his head through a hole in the door of James Franco's house, begging the actors to let him in. All of a sudden he is decapitated, and his head, gushing blood and all comes rolling towards the group, they proceed to kick the head around, terrified and screaming. For some of you, you may be reading this saying ""Oh that's disgusting, how could you laugh at that?"" People sometimes forget there's such a thing as ""gross out humor"" and it isn't always a poop joke, it's just a man getting decapitated is much more mature gross out humor.<br/><br/>And last, the ending. I will not spoil the ending, but my god...I did not see that ending coming based on the previews. Me and my friend were laughing uncontrollably, while cheering at the screen the whole time. I am glad that I did not spoil myself before seeing the movie, because the payoff was spectacular.<br/><br/>10/10 This is going down as one of my all-time favorite comedies!"

The plot is some watered down interpretation of the Christian religion's judgement day and i don't remember laughing uproariously (or otherwise) once.<br/><br/>The best thing it had going for it, in my humble opinion, was the art- style of the cg. Other than that it was your classic comedy that supplants an interesting plot and acting with cameos from more than enough celebrities to take up an hour of the screen time just with their irrelevant appearance.<br/><br/>The actors all portray themselves in the film and feign some small modicum of self realisation, without actually saying anything about the culture surrounding actors that needed to be said or hasn't been highlighted before. Not a bad film if you want to kill some time, but i cant conscionably rate it higher or it would brush shoulders with films that tried to do more than churn profits, made all the more heinous because materialism is one of the issues the characters ""learn"" about during their redemptive journey."
"Soul4673","5","5","11","8 August 2013"," don't see it. it''s disgusting and somewhat scarring to a girl who grew up watching Disney films as well as cheesy comedic films like Bruce Almighty
","OK...well where to begin? OK first of I'd like to point out that I saw this with my mum and I didn't have a clue what it was about....this is what i knew- Jay Baruchel is in it and Rhianna dies...so we saw it and I am very very surprised we stuck around til the end of this film. I am quite an innocent person so in retrospect when i heard this film was a 15 we should have ran out of the cinema but anyway we stayed and we saw my absolute nightmare of a film seriously....there were too many ridiculously annoying bits as well as actors I love showing despicable habits such as Micheal Cera...for those who have seen it they'll understand what I mean...but I'm not going to explain it either way. This film has made me fear for comedic films of the future because if this is in fact the end then I am afraid that my cinematic viewings will from now on only consist of fantasy and animation as both still remain innocent and unchanged as far as I can see.<br/><br/>Anyways I gave this film a 5. A 5 purely because despite the swearing and the childish attitude as well as the drug use I actually did like Jay Baruchel's character....he stood up for Emma Watson when she slept in Franco's house despite how she heard it and he believed in god and truthfully he didn't hate Jonah Hill...he just knew Jonah hated him apparently a lot more than he assumed as he sort of sent the devil to kill Jay...I really hated that bit. It was absolutely ridiculous and it frustrates me to even think about it now. Anyways I love Jay Baruchel...I think he's such an amazing actor and without him this film is a total bust.<br/><br/>OK I found three scenes in this film funny and that's the attempted resurrection of Jonah Hill, Hermionie robbing them and Jay wishing for the backstreet boys in heaven but every other bit of humour is absolutely disgusting and clearly ad-libbed. Me and my mum absolutely hated Danny Mcbride in this film....it got to a point where if I heard him even utter a syllable I'd close my eyes and cover my ears because I knew what was about to happen. In all fairness James Franco in one scene was just as bad as Danny Mcbride. James Franco's death was stupidly annoying....he starts to get sucked into heaven and gets cocky with it so gets dropped into the middle of a group of cannibals...and yeah what happens next is obvious. It's disgusting. <br/><br/>I regret seeing this film. I really do because I fear it's stolen a piece of my innocence however I still like being able to say I've seen all Jay Baruchel films ever made which is the only bright side of this film. <br/><br/>Don't see it. Trust me you'll regret it."

","This is not a classic comedy. Let me say this up front. <br/><br/>This is a play on what would happen to actors in crisis situation. Lots of arguing, lots of one- upsmenship and a lot of improv. And for me, a lot of laughs. It's a star studded cast, brilliant cameos (that should've been used a touch more) Jay Baruchel and Seth Rogen seem to play the straight characters as opposed to what the the other leads brought, which were more caricatures of their real life personas. <br/><br/>Sadly I felt a lot of people lost the plot when they started making less mainstream references to Freaks and Geeks, Your Highness, etc. and only found myself laughing at them (some of these references are a decade old) But it redeems itself regardless with other universal jokes and a surprisingly satisfying ending.<br/><br/>All in all a laugh out loud comedy worthy of a second and even third viewing to catch the quick subtle humour."

"jeffbabies","10","2","3","13 March 2020"," For the Cheech & Chong crowd. Period.
","This movie clearly appeals to a certain demographic - and from reading the wildly differing reviews, it's clearly misunderstood by people who should not have walked into the cinema to begin with. There's a way to offer differing opinions without being morally insulting to the creators or to those who appreciate it, though. Simply put, Seth Rogen and this particular troupe of actors have a very specific ""green"" following. This movie was never meant to appeal to everyone. It's unabashedly for a crowd that indulges in some of that organic greenery beforehand. If you've seen any of their previous movies, then you know that going in. If you haven't, well, then you made an unfortunate mistake. One doesn't walk into a Cheech & Chong movie and then complain about the amount of marijuana without sounding a tad naïve.<br/><br/>To begin with, this is a social commentary on the drugs and debauchery and vanity of Hollywood - and the self-centered actors who probably feel largely invincible most of the time. To criticize the movie for satirizing these things only proves that one don't understand satirical comedy. In fairness, yes, the jokes are likely only going to land with an audience that is just as stoned or drunk as the people on screen, and that's because the plot is written like a bad trip. That's the whole point! What makes a good movie is being able to take your audience along for the ride. And in this case (as with many others) Rogen knows that there are millions upon millions of people out there who like to watch movies (his and others) stoned. Being high for this is like being a rollercoaster drop that never ends. It's insanity as soon as the action starts unfolding. The inebriated audience feels just as lost and panicked as the cast while it's happening - and that's what makes it great, while you're going through it with them.<br/><br/>The plotlines are surely the reactions of people who have lived a largely vapid existence and do way too much partying to really know how to deal with what's happening. But that doesn't make the creators or the audience members who appreciate it lesser human beings. Some of the backlash has a very conservative and judgmental undertone, which is totally unwarranted and unfair. To each their own, I say. But at least give credit where credit is due. Some of the most influential geniuses and prolific artists/creators in history (if not all of them) indulged in various vices and you're kidding yourself if you believe otherwise. That's not to say that I'm calling Rogen and company geniuses, or that this movie is a historical classic... but I'm not entirely ruling out that making fun of themselves for the debauched people they are isn't also worthy of some respect and admiration. They managed to give their pot-smoking audience a really great trip, knowing they'd be totally high going into this. They took us on a ride along with the cast, in a sense making it interactive because the cast was as stoned as we were.<br/><br/>They movie doesn't tell you to get high first. That would be unethical. But it's implied when you see who's in it and who made it. You don't have to be high to watch it... but you definitely understand the intensity and the mind-numbingly awkward conversations if you are.<br/><br/>All in all, the bad reviews seem more about general discomfort with the subject matter than an actual critiquing of the story or the plot - and that can be whittled down to an unprepared audience member walking into a movie they had no business seeing if they hadn't smoked a joint first. It's probably safe to say that if you like your greenery when you watch a movie, then you'll probably enjoy this experience. If you're sober, it's not really meant for you. This is not Frozen. This is an audience tripping out to a cast who are themselves tripping out at the end of the world. Maybe there is something genius in that."

"CubsandCulture","10","2","3","2 August 2019"," Rogen's and Companies' weirdest ride
","That this blackish blue comedy is wonderfully self-deprecating largely goes without saying but it is worth noting, nonetheless. Much of the humor is derived just by how meta and how possibly real it all is. Why yes, I can imagine Hill being a two-faced twerp who just hates Baruchel rather easily. I am not even sure where James Franco was acting. Having watched the film a few times recently I was struck by how much the group dynamics-heightened for laughs-seem germane to guy friends of a certain age. It is all very, very funny and despite the plot stalling at times the film feels like no time has passed at all.<br/><br/>But the feature of the film I like the most is that it does get the a lot out of its high concept Re: end of days. There are some actual scary moments in this thing that work. Likewise, a few of the action set-pieces surprisingly work as fantasy action scenes. There is a just desserts quality to many of the characters fates that fit in with the End Times motif. Add in that a couple of dick jokes are deployed to keep it a comedy and this ends up being a really engaging text. It is what a guyland blue comedy should be.<br/><br/>Rogen and Goldberg are not great directors or writers per se but they do have a distinctive voice and enough basic competence at filmmaking to make fun entertaining films. This text is their signature work."

Unfortunately, the movie watches as if one (or more) of the actors edited it, again forgetting that members of the public would be watching the result."

","""This is the End"" is very easily one of the funniest movies I have seen in my entire life. It worked for many reasons. I absolutely loved how the characters were put in the drastic situation so that they were at their peak of crazy and acted out, bringing out their true characters, literally. The way that each character played an over exaggerated form of themselves made for great humor because they were able to poke fun at the media's image of themselves, and it made it feel like you were joking around with a few friends the whole time. Once this was established, it was able for the funniest lines in recent movie history to pour out one after another. Lets not forget the funniest exorcism in movie history and the surprisingly hilarious two minute discussion of ejaculation. The cameo of Michael Cera was the funniest cameo in recent memory. This review is getting sloppy, but just know that this whole movie is worth the price at the theater to see it with an audience rolling on the floor laughing to get the whole experience.

"Jackkrsk","9","6","15","20 June 2013"," ""This is the End is one of the funniest movies I've seen in quite a while - the last one being Ted (2012)""
","A few days ago I saw This is the End, released on June 12, 2013. This apocalyptic-comedy flick stars contemporary movie actors like Seth Rogan, James Franco, Jonah Hill, Jay Baruchel , Danny McBride, and Craig Robinson as fictional versions as themselves in the aftermath of global apocalypse. The film also stars in a supporting role Emma Watson (the 23 year old English actress, who was well known for her role as the female wizard Hermione from the Harry Potter film series), Michael Cera , Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Paul Rudd, Jason Segel, Rihanna, and Channing Tatum as fictional versions of themselves. Most of the actors that star in the film are, of course, mostly modern day comedic actors. Both Seth Rogan and Evan Goldberg wrote and directed the film. Speaking of which, here's a fun fact: Seth Rogan said that ""the party scenes were the most stressful for me to direct because there was so much going on"".<br/><br/>Just as Wes Craven's awful slasher/horror film, New Nightmare (which was released on October 14, 1994), This is the End stars people as themselves. The plot of This is the End starts off with a Canadian comedic actor Jay Baruchel, arriving in Los Angeles to visit an old friend and actor Seth Rogen. Seth then invites Jay to attend a housewarming party hosted by James Franco where they find other celebrities like Jonah Hill, Michael Cera, Craig Robinson, and Christopher Mintz-Plas.<br/><br/>At the raucous party, there is drinking, drugs, sex and other questionable acts. While the party is still going on, the global apocalypse begins. So, the movie stars like Seth, Jay, Danny, Craig, and Jonah decide to remain with James Franco at his house.<br/><br/>""This is the End is one of the funniest movies I've seen in quite a while - the last one being Ted (2012). The humorous acting and writing is in great part what make the film so hilarious. One example is Danny McBride's well timed remarks: ""Hermione stole all of our s—t"". But if you're wondering what makes that so funny, you will have to see it for yourselves. Seth Rogan and Evan Goldberg did an awesome job writing the screenplay's funny one-liners.<br/><br/>This is the End has an element of a horror-comedy genre. The horror comedy genre actually perfectly fits into the movie because it makes the film hilarious and suspenseful. In what is probably the funniest scene of the movie, Jonah Hill is shown possessed by a demon (same scene in the television commercial for the movie). That scene recalls to two classic exorcism-horror films : Rosemary's Baby (1968) and The Exorcist (1973). I really appreciated how that similarity pays tribute to the classic exorcism-horror films.<br/><br/>Although the movie is good, the one disappointment is the ending. The physical moment of the ending just didn't really fit in. The ending also didn't take the film seriously. If you are at all curious about how the movie ended, you all have to see it for yourselves. Disappointing ending or not, the movie is still worth watching and paying for in the movie theaters.<br/><br/>106 minutes of the film was overall very funny due to the acting, jokes, and one-liners. I give the film 3 out of 4 stars."

The actors playing themselves was a stroke of brilliance and all of them score bonus points for self deprecation. Michael Cera (playing the NPH role straight from Harold and Kumar) is brilliant. There are so many hilarious one liners in this movie I can't remember half of them, only that I laughed hysterically the whole time. Obviously, there are some ridiculous moments but that's the POINT. There is a dumb moment at the end involving a washed up boy band but other than that I was not disappointed. If you have a sense of humor you will like this movie!!"

I tried to like it, I really did, but this movie plain sucked. Seth Rogen and Jonah Hill are pretty funny actors, add the others and it should be a slam dunk, but there were so many sad moments in this movie, which I'm assuming were supposed to be funny. The sad part is that I went into it with little to no expectations. Should have watched a taped PVR show instead. Glad I borrowed it and did not rent or buy it."

Was this movie believed to show that there is indeed rapture going to happen and it will lead to this kind of situation which may be hilarious. I enjoyed Superbad and Pineapple express but this movie I just couldn't figure what was going on. I am afraid that the directors and producers didn't either. There were some artists whose movies I have enjoyed in past but I didn't recognize the entire cast and I didn't enjoy this movie just because these guys were in this movie.

","Maybe I'm getting old -- but I found ""This Is the End"" to be way too long, and not all that funny. I more or less like Seth Rogan, James Franco, and Michael Cera, but this movie feels like a single joke that just goes on and on. How many jokes about farts and semen and dicks can you hear before they're just not funny anymore? I guess for these guys, and perhaps for most audiences, the answer is ""a whole lot."" I dunno. I need some actual wit to sustain my interest in a comedy. There is nothing like that to be found here; just extremely obvious jokes about weed and bodily functions.<br/><br/>It's not an entirely unpleasant film; these guys obviously had a lot of fun making it; I mildly enjoyed watching them clown around and have a good time -- but after about the first 30 minutes, I started to feel more and more like I was watching a very expensive version of one of those improvised ""movies"" that kids sometimes make over a weekend with someone's dad's videocamera. At a certain point, I found myself impatiently looking at my watch. If you must see this film, I strongly recommend that you wait for it to appear on Netflix. You won't have missed a thing.

"pcernea-1","10","5","12","30 July 2013"," Hilarious, Chilling, Philosophical
","It's easy to give ""This Is the End"" a bad review, because it makes the viewer uncomfortable. As some reviewers have rightly pointed out, it's a horror movie. If it were just a screwball comedy with immature jokes, it would be on par with 40-Y.O. Virgin, and indeed many such (hilarious) jokes are used throughout to lighten the mood (the argument over the magazine leaps to mind). But in fact this movie is a thriller worthy of Hitchcock, and it raises deep philosophical questions: how would people start acting if the rapture really started taking place? What does it mean to ""be good""? Do we envy movie stars for making way more money than us? How does a group of buddies start acting when things get serious? Because of this comedy mixed with depth, and its audacity, I give it a 10.<br/><br/>People have commented that the acting is bad. I would say the acting is so good that a lot of times you think the cameos are as obnoxious in real life as they portray themselves to be in this film.<br/><br/>The demise of James Franco is particularly poignant. I would venture to say he has the best character out of any of the (anti)heroes. (True, he hoarded food, but it was his to begin with, and he provided sanctuary to his friends, as well as leadership.) Yet Franco meets the same fate as the sadistic cannibal McBride because of Franco's hubris/arrogance. Rubbing it in the badguy's face is as bad as being bad. This illustrates, I believe, an unfortunate fact: that society often has as little tolerance for the ""proud"" as the ""bad"".<br/><br/>I found the ascent of Seth Rogen and Jay Baruchel to be extremely cathartic, and with the blue light and beautiful music of Whitney Houston, it made me (a 28 year-old man) almost start crying. The saving of Seth Rogen reminds us that sacrificing for friends and loved ones, being truly good, more than being good ""by the letter"" is what really matters.<br/><br/>Finally the end leaves us unfulfilled/uncomfortable, asking, what would heaven really be like? Is it just hedonistic pleasure? Might it be as good as something we already have on earth if we're lucky? It reminds us that we should appreciate the good things we have."

","When a movie has very little plot - I latch onto the plot it does have and try to make sense of it. If the plot holds true, even if it's very simple, and keeps me engaged - great. That's all I can ask. We're not talking about a great work of fiction for this movie. I knew it was going to be simple going in. That said, I'm a plot guy. I don't care if some of the jokes are funny... I'm going to be looking for a story.<br/><br/>Here is what I liked and didn't like about the plot:<br/><br/>1) Best thing, in reflection, was that NOBODY at the party was pulled into heaven. I laughed when I realized this. Also, the fact that Emma Watson was left behind was also pretty funny too.<br/><br/>2) The party has no symbology at all. What does it/they represent? If at the end there is a party, then what is different about the party at the beginning? Why is one okay, and the other not okay? If Jay is uncomfortable in one, then why is he not uncomfortable in the other? Are they trying to tell me that the Back Street Boys is all Jay wanted? That's crazy. It doesn't even make sense. In the beginning, all Jay wanted was his old friend back, and hang out. Wouldn't that be Jay's idea of heaven? They really didn't set up going to heaven well at all. It was just something that happened.<br/><br/>3) The demons could obviously get into the house any time they wanted (re: smash through doors, or whatever). So, what were they waiting for? Then, Jonah is possessed when he prays that Jay would die. Maybe that's his deal with the devil, but he didn't get his bargain fulfilled? Was that supposed to be the demon in the other house that was chasing Jay?<br/><br/>4) They really pushed Jay's opinion of not liking people at the party allot, but they didn't do anything with it. He didn't grow to like anyone except Craig, and in fact, had a falling out with Seth. Jay started off as a reluctant participant, and ended up as a reluctant participant. There was no growth. He tried to save his friend at the end. Big woop. <br/><br/>5) ""Getting into heaven"" thing was a big cop out. Do something selfless and you get in? Wouldn't it make more sense that each person would have to face their own personal demon? <br/><br/>Jay needed to let Seth be with his new friends, and accept them.<br/><br/>Seth needed to stop pushing Jay to do things he didn't want to. That's the way the movie was set up. They needed to follow through.<br/><br/>Anyway, there were moments it was very funny. Too many penis and gay jokes for me. They could have cut them in half and it would still be allot of penis and gay jokes. Sure, some of them were hilarious, but they really should have found something else to make fun of too."

","I have never reviewed a film on IMDb until now because I feel like I really must defend this film to all you bible pushers that keep creating fake names so u can lower the rating and trash it!! First of all pet me get this out of the way now I am in no way religious but I don't discriminate against anyone who is. This movie is absolutely hysterical no doubt about it.... The characters are playing themselves yes but exaggerated or made up versions of themselves. One review a man was complaining that Cera is a huge druggie and coke head cause he's playing himself in the movie.... Come on people take a joke!! And for all u people complaint about the rapture and them making fun of it and how it offends u then why the HELL would u go see this movie??? It baffles me cause the trailer hides nothing! My only explanation to this is you must not have seen it and are reviewing a movie because you don't like the subject matter.

","An original idea, but that's about it. If these people talk this way on film, I'd hate to have a conversation with them off camera. A few funny moments that were not drawn from low-class (crass) comedy, but repetitive and relied too much on ""d**k"" humor. It was about twice as long as necessary, but I'm not sure why a film like this is necessary. It seems these actors just wanted to party and somehow got a studio to pay for them to be self-indulgent and see how many offensive words and ideas they could cram into their film. I suppose if you live and talk this way, you might enjoy this movie, but I just wanted to go home and take a shower."

Seth Rogen was soooo irritating here, I already hated Seth based on his previous roles in films, but this just made me hate him even more! And the rest of the cast was not quite as irritating, but still. The dialogue sucked, so did the acting as a matter of fact. Also, the loaded up WAYY too much on the non stop crude/sexual humor, it got to where it was just over blown, stupid, and annoying. Channing Tatum's cameo was the only part I actually enjoyed, and that's kinda sad.

","OK, so an ensemble cast of talented actors play themselves in an apocalyptic comedy. Sounds original and intriguing. So what happened with This Is The End? Why wasn't it good? Even more disturbing is why has it received almost universal praise from critics and fans? <br/><br/>The film definitely has it's funny moments early on; however, it begins to drag near the middle and the tired attempts at humor onward to the end come off as downright desperate. It's painful. The loose script that allowed the actors to kind of do their own thing really begins to show just how difficult this can be for even seasoned actors. <br/><br/>I'd like to think I'm no square with a decent sense of humor (I was the class clown in high school after all) but was it really necessary for the comedy to turn so vulgar? ***SPOILER ALERT*** Some parts were borderline criminal, like when Jay Baruchel starts talking about which of the men might rape Emma Watson. Then there's the parts that are too XXX, like when Danny McBride spends entirely too much time talking about masturbating all over James Franco's crib or the scene where a giant devil walks through Los Angeles with his manhood swinging freely for all to see. ***END SPOILER***<br/><br/>I actually can't believe James Franco agreed to do this garbage. It's like a couple of steps backward for him. He's shown himself to be a pretty good actor with performances in films like 127 Hours, Oz The Great and Powerful, Milk, and Rise of the Planet of the Apes. Now he goes and does this and all of a sudden it's like Wayne's World 2013. <br/><br/>The concept of celebrities playing themselves in a disaster/comedy gets high marks but the horrible script, special effects, and surprisingly bad acting (even for a comedy) sinks This is the End. Don't get sucked into the Matrix. It's OK to take the red pill. This is not a good movie."

Yet another group that think that if they appear in movies together then success is ensured, well this is evidence that it doesn't. The special effects where not bad too, which I feel where wasted in this movie. I know it was a parody of sorts but I felt towards the end there didn't seem to be any differential in reality and fiction with the characters and I ended up disliking them more.

","This is the End should never have been. Billed as a comedy/fantasy, the audience becomes lost in the deviant dialogue during the first five minutes of the actors' performances. James Franco, Seth Rogen and array of actors portray themselves as they wander through one of the worst scripts to emanate from Hollywood this year. Our cast of protagonists drug themselves to the point of passing out during the film's numerous scenes. Bathroom humor is employed throughout the movies 107 minute running time, to draw out the minimal acting abilities of the cast. In the event I reveal the plot, most would deter from seeing this train wreck.Franco's usual arrogance permeates the film from the moment he is on the screen. Rogen, an Adam Sandler wannabe, appears to bastardize his few lines on purpose. In the event you are seeking a movie to detach yourself from reality for a few hours, look somewhere else.

","As my review title suggests, I truly believe that is the best film of the year so far. This comedy gets the balance between jokes and plot absolutely perfect as throughout the movie we are constantly laughing and also wondering how they will get out of the apocalyptic wasteland that was once Los Angeles.<br/><br/>I would call this movie the Ultimate ""Bromance"" as the bond between Seth and Jay is the main storyline throughout the movie. At the start we see that Jay is visiting his old buddy Seth Rogen in Los Angeles and Seth wants him to meet all his new friends so he brings Jay to James Franco's house party. Here we see countless numbers of big name celebrities make cameos from Pop star Rihanna to How I met your mother's Jason Segel. We also see Michael Cera completely intoxicated and high as a kite acting laughably stupid which comes to a climax with his inevitable death due to a collapsing lamppost when he is quoted in saying ""Is it that bad?"" And ""well that's embarrassing"" as he finds his lost phone in his pocket as he bleeds out. <br/><br/>Later we find out that Jay had visited Los Angeles before without staying with Seth and he confesses that the two are growing apart. This causes a slight rift in their friendship but they have more important things to deal with as they run from a possessed Jonah Hill and Satan's demons.. Finally as Craig redeems himself to be lifted into heaven and James almost does until he flips off Danny, they are left staring down Satan himself when they make amends and decide to die together. Finally Jay begins to be lifted into heaven and tries to carry Seth who eventually lets go to allow Jay to make it. Of course and Seth starts to enter Satan's fiery mouth he is engulfed in a blue beam which lifts him into heaven with Jay all as Whitney Houston's ""I Will Always Love You"" is playing to add extra emotion.<br/><br/>In conclusion, although I basically just retold the story. This movie is an absolutely fantastic piece of filmography and I would highly recommend it to absolutely anyone!"

","When was the last time a movie blew your expectations away? And it did it not with lots of drama, emotions or even action, but comedy? Well for me it was a long time ago. And I'll tell you, my expectations where very high about this one. I love Evan Goldberg movies and with the help of Seth Rogen something good had to come out of it. So when this movie began I was a little worried. Though I cracked up many times at the beginning at at the party sequence there was something missing. And I'm not saying it was bad at all! There where some really funny references with celebrities and coked up Michael Cera was some really funny I'm just saying it was going somewhere different than I expected. But ten minutes later the apocalypse started. hit the fan celebrities died and then we got the five friends trapped in James Franco's house. From here the mechanic, the acting, the improvising, the writing just improved by the second. And this lasted till the END of the movie! The chemistry between all of the actors was so natural and the timing of the jokes was so spot on! Danny McBride had some of his funniest scenes that I've seen in his movies in This is the End and Jonah Hill played this version of himself that I just crack up when thinking about it. Of course Franco, Baruchel and Robinson also where hilarious and smartly done. The Emma Watson sequence adds some lady badassery to the movie! And *SPOILERS* *SPOILERS* by the time near the ending when they go out of the house and encounter the ""new"" McBride was my favorite twist in scenery o the movie. The gimp man! I was gagging for air in that scene! When Channing Tatum says like ""I loove hiim"" I went full on peeing my pants laughter. What follows... Celine Dione, The Backstreet Boys did the satirical part of the movie. The be good do good to go to heaven was smartly written and the awesome never-ending party in the skies was a perfect representation of what we actually would expect heaven to be! By the end you had this feeling of having had the best and funniest time watching this awesome ****. This movie showed the audience and the industry that we don't need all the cheap hit comedies that use the getting hit in the balls and fart humor that is getting worse by the day. Adam Sandler just got by this movie. I hope Rogen and Goldberg keep making these marbles and keep cracking us up. Congrats dudes! I'm giving this good time a 10 outta 10."

","Okay so lets just start off about how this movie is just amazing and its hilarious. I saw this in theaters with my cousin and sister and i usually don't write reviews but its definitely worth it for this movie. i give this movie a 10/10 because it was a well thought out plot with amazing actors with standard acting and a genius script...and i was CRACKING UP throughout the entire movie (and no, I'm not even old enough to drink.. so i wasn't drunk.)it was funnier then any other movie I've seen and made me laugh even more than when i saw step brothers for the first time (in my opinion step brothers is the 2nd funniest movie and this is the 1st) <br/><br/>it starts off with Seth Rogan picking up jay Baruchel at the airport coming back to L.A. they go back to Seth's house and it already starts to get funny when they walk in the room and there's like 10 pounds of weed and some wrapped spelling ""Jay"". they hang out there for a while and show it in fast motion.<br/><br/>Then Seth says there's a party at James Franco's house and jay doesn't want to go because he says no one there likes him and he doesn't like them back (espessially Jonah hill)but they end up going because of Seth.<br/><br/>they show up at the party and when jay leaves to smoke a cigarette Seth ditches him to hang out with other people. but then when he runs out of cigarettes Seth and jay go to a local gas station to get some. but then there's a huge earth quake and a bunch of people shoot into the sky in blue beams. (we later find out in the movie that the ones that fly up in the beams are going to heaven and the people remaining on earth that god didn't pick has to fight for survival against the devil himself and a bunch of other creatures that he sent to help him.) when they run back to the party there's an earth quake so everyone runs outside to see the Hollywood hills burning in flames. as they're staring at it a huge hole in the ground leading to th firey pits of hell breaks loose.lots of people fall in and Michael cera dies from being stabbed by a telephone pole and it goes right through his body.<br/><br/>the ones that remain are Seth rogan, jay baruchel, James Franco, Craig Robinson, and Jonah hill. they board up the house and get out all of the food they have.<br/><br/>later on, Danny McBride shows up in the house and adds a lot of comical sense into the movie (even though the movie was HILARIOUS without him). they all try to survive for a while.<br/><br/>after a while, they decide to kick out Danny McBride then when Jonah hill is sleeping, he gets raped by the devil and later on he gets possessed (this is comical but yet it is the death of Jonah hill) they try to perform an exorcism on him and then they accidentally light him on fire. he gets up and chases them all around the house until he dies.<br/><br/>the house burns down into flames and they're stuck outside. a big huge monster shows up and they come up with a plan that Craig Robinson has to distract it while they go to the car. he gets pulled up into heaven for sacrificing himself for his friends. this shows the others that they just need to do something extremely good to get into heaven.<br/><br/>when they're driving they get hit by a big van and when they get out they find out that its a gang of cannibals and Danny McBride leads the gang. (he came out of the van with Channing Tatum on a dog leash which i found really funny) and they come up with a plan for James Franco to sacrifice himself and let Seth rogan and jay baruchel run away. before James gets eaten, he gets put in the blue beam and as he gets pulled up, he flicks off the cannibals and says ""SUCK IT MOTHA F*CKAS!"" and god changes his mind and drops him out of the beam and the cannibals eat him.<br/><br/>as Seth and jay are running a HUGE monster comes and tries to kill them. jay tells Seth that he's sorry for everything that he's done and admits a bunch of things (Seth was mad at jay before this) and he said he wanted to die together. then a blue beam comes down from the sky and grabs jay. jay tries to hold onto Seth's hand but when they get up about half way, they stop going up and Seth rogan said he couldn't hold him back from going to heaven and that god wouldn't take them both. he let go and as he was dropping into the monsters mouth a blue beam came down and got him for not only thinking of himself and sacrificing himself for his friend. they flew up to heaven together and when they got up there they met back up with Craig Robinson at the gate.<br/><br/>this summary/review doesn't make this movie sound very funny but trust me, it is."

"hellraiser7","9","4","9","23 June 2013"," Apocalipse Now
","There are a lot of things I can think of doing if the coming apocalypse occurs, staying with my best friends, staying with my girlfriend, or if single find ask out a celebrity on a date (yeah I know long shot but hey, end of days is coming doesn't hurt to try) but holing up with these characters under the same roof is not one of them.<br/><br/>I do like the idea, in a way it's the kind of idea we all might have on the possibility of the worst coming, why not hole up with people you like/love. This is sort of that idea only problem is some of these characters don't exactly like or love each other back which makes it all the more funny because this is also one of the last things you would want to happen.<br/><br/>There are some good gore even CGI effects; OK, not all CGI was good but I think that just added to the humor. But really were in this film for the group of six and what they do during the apocalypse, this kind of comedy really wouldn't of worked if it wasn't for the ensemble which consists of Seth Rogen, Jay Barshel, Danny McBride, James Franco, Craig Robertson, and Jonah Hill whom all play themselves well sort of.<br/><br/>What makes all six of them funny is how they react or handle a rather bizarre and logically ridiculous situation, one of my favorite moments is how their struggling to ration the food, water, and supplies. Or another making a home video sequel to Pinapple Express out of boredom, which is funny because it sort of reminds me of the same ploy in the film ""Be Kind Rewind"" but just the mere ironic fact that four of the cast members Seth, Franco, Craig, and Danny were all in that film. And of course the video journals they make which are also funny because of the honesty or dishonesty they express. <br/><br/>Also the fact that each of the actors are playing themselves or at least contrary versions of themselves. In a way each of them aren't parodying themselves but actually more satirizing on their fame and identities to the public eye. It's not a easy rope to walk, satirizing on yourself but at the same time playing yourself in small doses. It's sort of the satire on what we don't see a celebrity say or do when out of the public eye, it's a bit funny because it's true sometimes that one celebrity might act nice when in reality he or she isn't. As a saying goes reality is a whole different story indeed.<br/><br/>There is some physical humor but it's powered more by verbal humor and this film has some dialog that is just hilarious. Most of what the characters say will make you laugh your head of and may'be even grown a bit at the same time. Though at times some of it is funny because there are some parts of the verbal humor that could be true, and really made me think if this is what this person or that person was thinking or feeling in their time in Hollywood; or likewise what we think of them.<br/><br/>There are cameo appearances where even they play contrary to themselves, seeing what they do and what happens to most or all of them. Though my favorite cameo no doubt is Emma Watson whom is hot as usual. Her appearance is funny because she seems really out of place in the film it's not the type you'd actually see her in and that's the point, as if it's an actor/actress in a project for the paycheck despite how ridiculous or bad it is.But what she does at the end made me crack up and turn me on at the same time. Why the hell her character didn't get transported to heaven is anyone's guess but that's just how the story went and on a side note I'd go with her if it's the end of days.<br/><br/>The pace and the humor never lets up, due to how things just escalate and get worse or should I say more ridiculous by the minute for the six. All six just get funnier and may'be even a little crazier. But let alone the fact this film takes place in one spot throughout most to all the film, much like a bottle episode in a TV show; I always liked them because they were usually about characters in one spot arguing and working out differences. <br/><br/>There are times when it's almost touching (I said almost)as we see some of them bonding mainly Seth, Josh, and Craig. But also work out issues weather they like it or not, but then again in the forth coming apocalypse what the heck else are you going to do.<br/><br/>Overall, ""This is the End"" is absurd fun which is funny to the end.<br/><br/>Rating: 3 and a half stars"
"Coventry","5","3","6","3 October 2016"," It's the End of the World as we know it  and Hollywood doesn't feel fine!
","Should I or should I not review this movie? That's the question I asked myself for nearly a week, because – and I do fully realize that nobody cares, really – I decided long time ago that I would restrict myself to exclusively reviewing horror, cult or exploitation movies and then preferably only the most obscure and peculiar ones. I want to stay clear of mainstream Hollywood productions with famous names in the cast or gigantic budgets. But on the other hand I truly fancy apocalyptic tales and flamboyant gory stuff, so in spite of its A-listed cast, ""This is the End"" actually qualifies to receive a review after all. Okay, the whole project is basically a joke and probably only the cast and crew found it truly entertaining, but it does inarguably feature gore, mayhem and a truckload of references/homages to classic as well as lesser known genre titles. <br/><br/>The idea is undeniably original and innovative. A group of actors, supposedly not playing but ""being"" themselves, are gathered together for a housewarming party when all of a sudden the biblical apocalypse descends upon them; - and the rest of Hollywood and the world I reckon. Most of the party guests are annihilated straight away, like for example Rihanna who gets sucked into a super-massive black hole in the ground or Michael Cera who gets impaled on a lantern pole, but six of them entrench themselves in the ultramodern home of their host. They are James Franco, Seth Rogen, Jonah Hill, Jay Baruchel, Craig Robinson and the uninvited Danny McBride. Whilst fire and brimstone reproduce hellish monsters outside, the survivors are practically murdering each other on the inside. ""This is the End"" is not much more than a spitfire of absurd situations and inside jokes about the cast members' previous collaborations (particularly ""Pineapple Express"" seems popular). If you don't particularly like these guys or the films they made, you will most certainly dislike ""This is the End"" and consider it to be a pretentious and nonsensical piece of rubbish. As a film fan, you can't really ignore the influence guys like Seth Rogen and Jonah Hill had on comedy cinema in the last 10-15 years. They appeared in too many movies to list, often together, and the vast majority of them were box office hits (""Superbad"", ""Knocked-Up"", ""The Interview"", ""Bad Neighbors"" ). Their humor is often crude, monotonous and orientated at soft-drug use and bedevilment between friends, but their films do feature imaginative premise and many downright ingenious ideas. ""This is the End"" also relies on a handful of really strong sequences and comic highlights (for example the exorcism of Jonah Hill) but otherwise it's not much more than an okay time-waster."
"bryank-04844","9","3","6","23 August 2015"," 'This Is the End' is no doubt one of the year's funniest films so far.
","Car crashes, explosions, decapitations, exorcisms, the apocalypse and tons of dick jokes make up Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen's 'This Is the End' – and it's the most fun I've had at the movies in ten years. In this dark comedy, the entire Apatow gang plus many more cameos from popular comedians all play themselves as they take on the end of days. It's gut-bustingly funny, sick, crude and self-deprecating, played like a twisted Reality show, complete with solo interviews and cameras scattered throughout the movie. I anticipate a big opening with long-lasting power, even after 'Man of Steel' opens later this week.<br/><br/>'This Is the End' takes it cues from a short film that Goldberg and Rogen made called 'Jay and Seth Versus the Apocalypse' that had virtually the same cast, but was never released publicly. It only ran two minutes and was very low-budget. This time around, they have a mega budget with visual effects on a grand scale, and the cast has more to work with. Our two main focus points are Rogen and Jay Baruchel, as Baruchel flies into Los Angeles to visit his long-time Canadian friend, Rogen, for the week. Out of the entire Apatow cast of actors, Baruchel still resides in Canada and has a serious disdain for the life in L.A.<br/><br/>We get a funny glimpse of the lives of young, successful actors in Hollywood, complete with all of the drugs, booze and jokes to go with it. The affair takes place at James Franco's brand new home that he designed himself, as he is a man of many talents. His home is fit for a king and overlooks the Hollywood sign, just a block or two away from a shopping center. The first segment of the movie is packed with hilarious discussions and songs from this all-star comedy cast, including Mindy Kaling, Michael Cera, Rihanna, Emma Watson, Jason Segel,and Christopher Mintz- Plasse. At one point, we see Cera getting serviced by two girls at the same time, all the while Baruchel is less than thrilled to be there.<br/><br/>As Rogen and Baruchel walk across the street to grab a pack of smokes and a snack, all hell breaks loose literally. There are explosions, fires, large holes in the ground opening up, cars crashing into people and buildings, and beams of light shooting out of the sky and lifting people up. All of Los Angeles is engulfed in flames and many of Franco's guests are killed or swallowed up by the giant holes. After the initial apocalyptic impact, only a few survivors are left inside Franco's mansion, including Franco, Rogen, Baruchel, Jonah Hill and Craig Robinson. After they regroup, they go through their food, water and weapons (which amount to only a baseball bat and a prop gun from the movie 'Flyboys').<br/><br/>After their first night, the survivors are awakened by Danny McBride, who wasn't invited to Franco's party but ended up passing out in his bathtub. McBride uses most of their rationed food to cook breakfast, completely unaware of what happened the night before. Soon after that, Emma Watson shows up to take refuge, but leaves quickly after overhearing the guys talking about a non-existent ""rapey"" vibe. Now left with nothing liquid to drink, tensions run high and things get serious. McBride turns into a horrible houseguest who takes more rations than he should, whereas the rest of the group tries to come to terms with what has happened and figure out how to survive, or at least get into heaven. The results are a highly entertaining yet perverse thrill ride.<br/><br/>A lot of the film seems to have a healthy dose of improv between the actors, mostly dealing with certain parts of the anatomy, drugs and sex. We also get their takes on religion and how worthy of being saved they think they are, which offers a little insight into the Hollywood elite and how they think. The film takes a couple of twists and turns into demonic possession territory, followed by a monster movie. It all works if you don't take it seriously.<br/><br/>The entire cast turn in solid gold performances and do what they do best, which is provide great comedy. I laughed from start to finish, even if some of the jokes are far-fetched or straight-up disgusting. 'This Is the End' is no doubt one of the year's funniest films so far. It will be difficult for any comedy to top what Rogen and Goldberg have delivered. I can't wait to see this again."

","Of course this review is coming from a guy who loves Your Highness, Pineapple Express, Hot Tub Time Machine, and all that stupid, silly stuff. That said...<br/><br/>Loved it. I went to the theater to get some big laughs and that's what I got. I wasn't expecting a good plot, but it was original and interesting.<br/><br/>Danny McBride stole the show. I was expecting big laughs from Jonah Hill and he had a couple hilarious parts; however, I felt like he was holding back. Maybe it was because there were just so many funny people on the set that it was tough for him to shine. Seth Rogen had some hilarious lines.<br/><br/>Also, I think this is the first movie where you laugh out loud while people are dying horrible deaths. It's hard to describe how humor can come from all the over-the-top death scenes. You have to see it to know what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>This movie is not recommended for highly religious or conservative people. But... Recommended for fans of McBride, Rogen, Hill, and the usual suspects."

I'm totally into immature humor, but this was so lame and uninspired, I was amazed how the script was accepted by so many stars in the first place. Why does this even have 8 points.

Why were these people morons and simpletons? I have never seen any of them and was not even aware these idiots were ""actors.""<br/><br/>It was an insult to intelligence, but at least I can now be forewarned about this Seth person and not see any more of his movies.

The first third was people getting stoned & stupid in singles and groups. The next third was how these ""friends"" turned on each other when things got tough. Emma Watson puts in two cameo scenes as her anything but helpless self (sorry to see her in this smoking turd). Add to this segment enough blood, gore, and violence to more than earn the R rating. I missed the end... For the first time in 15 years I walked out of a movie before it ended. If there was a way to give this film negative stars, I'd be on it in a second."
"schappe1","1","6","17","28 June 2013"," I missed the end of This is The End
","There are so many apocalyptic movies out these days I decided that if I was going to see one, I wanted it to be a comedy. So I went to see ""This is the End"", which supposedly about the end of the world as seen by some Hollywood types, playing themselves, sort of. I thought it would be a spoof of those other movies and of Hollywood. Sounded good. <br/><br/>Instead 90% was about a bunch of unpleasant people holed up in James Franco's house deciding to live it up as best they can with drugs, booze and the little remaining food, further fortified with plenty of sex and bathroom humor. One guy is angry because he didn't even want to go to Franco's party and now he's stuck there with a bunch of people he doesn't like. I empathized with him totally. I never laughed once, although I did crack half a smile at one line,(but forgot what it is). The other people there kind of snickered once. <br/><br/>I suspect the writers and maybe the actors were as high as their characters when they made the film and I the audience would have to be the same to enjoy it as much as they did. Maybe they should have passed joints out with the tickets like those 3D Glasses. It may have a great, hilarious ending I missed. But I kept looking at my watch, (which seemed to be having a losing battle with the space-time continuum), and inventorying the many things I would rather be doing than watching this flick. I finally decided to do them."
"siderite","8","4","10","15 October 2013"," Even the souls of comedy actors can be redeemed
","I had a lot of fun watching the film, as Hollywood actors face The End of Days. The plot is deliciously simple: a party in L.A. turns sour when the Apocalypse ends the world and a bunch of moderately famous actors, playing themselves, are stuck in a house awaiting a rescue that will never come.<br/><br/>If you are amazed of how many well known celebrities are participating in the cast, know that as partying gives way to panic, most of them die in the first quarter of the film, leaving all but six people to play the rest of the film. Petty and fussy weaklings that they are, the Hollywood actors start to lose their civilized patina and show their true color, turning on each other. I especially liked how Seth Rogen - who wrote, produced and starred as one of the lead characters - started as a nice guy, but turned up to be a duplicitous coward.<br/><br/>The is the End joins a list of films (mostly written by Canadians so far :) ) which are original, funny and have ingenious scripts. Perhaps the sexual jokes and weird behavior was a bit over board, but then we are talking about people from L.A., so it might even be realistic. I think the scene I liked best was the failed exorcism which almost worked, but for the friends that were afraid the demon would get annoyed.<br/><br/>I would have loved more action from Emma Watson, who has grown into a delicious young woman with an equally pleasant British accent, and could have contributed with a bit of that English wit. I liked how the actors were not afraid to play heavily caricatured versions of themselves, just look at Channing Tatum. He had a lot of guts playing the part he did.<br/><br/>All in all it was an entertaining comedy, especially if you know the actors involved from other movies. I even found myself laughing out loud at some scenes. You should watch it, I think."
"castillooffice","4","4","10","9 October 2013"," Slapstick-Comedy, slightly better than Scary Movie
","The first 15 Minutes, which mainly show Hollywood-Stars like James Franco and Emma Watson making fun of themselves, is very funny, but then an Apocalypse-Scenario comes up and it gets way too clownish- even for Seth Rogen. You are confronted with the kind of Slapstick Humor that makes Scary Movie unwatchable for me. The Apocalypse-Szene ends around 00:25:00 and afterwards the film turns into a boring and again way-too-silly-to-take- somewhat-serious version of a survival story and you really just want to turn it off. <br/><br/>The charming and refreshing self-irony is definitely the best thing about this movie, but it is not enough to keep you entertained for 106 Minutes. It may be enjoyable for Scary-Movie-Fans or die-hard Seth Rogan Fans."
"billygoat1071","8","4","10","22 September 2013"," Apocalyptic Insanity
","The most obvious thing you will know about This is The End is it's an apocalyptic comedy with its stars playing themselves. It sounded like a gimmick for them to just have fun in the midst of destruction. While there's dope tripping and endless vulgarity, the film is surprisingly able to find its own heart underneath the craziness. But of course, this is all about joining the survival of these popular comedians as they mess around the situation. There are kinds of audiences that will enjoy this very much, while the rest of the viewers may also tag along only if they can. But really, this movie is so likable no matter how crude these people can be.<br/><br/>Predictably, the plot fills their usual thing: slapstick, constant phallic humor, and more drugs; plus some humorous gore, inside jokes, and apocalyptic mockeries. If you're a fan of this kind of comedy, then definitely you'll get a limitless joy within the disasters. But the film is funnier when the cast is simply making fun of themselves by trying to find a way to survive, like making stupid decisions and cry for their hilariously unreasonable complains and demands. Since that's whole point of this, I guess it succeeds as the best part of the film's humor. Even inside James Franco's house is as chaotic as what's happening outside of the end of the world. It's pure insanity.<br/><br/>Besides of its ridiculousness, the film actually has a story in its characters. It mainly focuses on the friendship of Jay Baruchel and Seth Rogen. Their bromance at least gives this insane apocalypse some sense which keeps the experience from being a completely vapid outrageous comedy. It's not the most compelling one either but it adds sweetness through the disasters going on. The cast sure loves mocking around, but the other side of Baruchel calms the idiocy down a bit and gives most of the heart of the film; while Seth Rogen and James Franco do their usual comedy part which is pleasurable enough to watch. Craig Robinson and Jonah Hill also had some memorable laughs. And finally, Danny McBride steals all of his scenes.<br/><br/>This is The End is nothing more than a self-indulged fan service, but it somehow succeeds for being smartly dumb and at least makes it up to itself after the endless amount of crudity. I mean imagine, what's better than an apocalyptic movie starring Bruce Willis or John Cusack? Definitely an apocalyptic movie starring a bunch of high on pot manchildren. And both do have in common: it has self-redeeming characters who make preposterous ways to survive. The difference is this is a comedy. All of the stupidity is indeed in purpose, almost like spoof of the genre without referencing much about its other movies. Well, self-awareness is always respectable to everyone. Anything else, This is The End is a fun time at the movies. It actually lives up to its promise, and it seems a full scale of ridiculous is already enough for this to be a solid entertainment."
"cameronelkin-499-473280","10","4","10","15 September 2013"," A near perfect Halloween horror / comedy / stoner movie
","Let me start off by saying this movie is not for everyone. If you cant handle gratuitous violence, nudity, drug taking and generally ripping the p out of the Christian belief system then stay away. If you can on the other hand then this movie is for you. Far too many films these days try to cater their comedy to a larger audience and try to be so politically correct to the extent that it become's clichéd and frankly boring. This film is completely shameless in its delivery of pure unadulterated stoner humour and left me rolling around in stitches laughing my head off throughout at least 50% of the duration of the film. You cant please everyone and it doesn't try to. At times it feels like it goes out of its way to offend certain people and the thought of those people getting offended while watching this film only serves to add to the hilarity. What also impressed me was the quality of the horror, it will lull you into a false sense of security and there are plenty of jump out your seat moments. The only films you could compare this to are something by Quentin Tarantino and I feel that the Seth Rogan crew gives even the master of shock horror / comedy a run for his money."

","""This is the End"" is one of those films that you'd expect to be funny, and somehow exceeds your expectations in ways you never imagined was possible. A movie that leaves you laughing so hard, your literally gasping for air. A movie you will quote for years, watch repeatedly and instantly refer to as one of your favorite movies. Believe it or not, ""This is the End"" is THAT good. Its the Seth Rogen movie audiences have been waiting for since ""Pineapple Express"", and the funniest one since ""Superbad"". In this day and age, its hard to make a comedy this memorable, since time and time again, the same jokes get recycled. But when you get out of the fictitious/formulaic/gross-out realm of comedy these days, there is an entirely different spectrum most comedies neglect. Satire. ""This is the End"" is a comedy based on comedies. Never before has a comedy been this self aware of what it is, and rarely do actors ever be themselves just for the sake of laughs. In this case, it really does work. Every actor in the film plays a satirical version of his or herself. Seth Rogen is the pothead, Danny McBride is the creep, James Franco is the poser, Jonah Hill is the fake guy, Jay Baruchel is the shy one and Craig Robinson is the token black friend. They play their stereotypes to their advantage, and the fact that they are aware makes room for even more laughs. This holds true for the rest of the cast of comedic cameos, all except for Michael Cera. There's sort of a hilarious surprise with Michael Cera, but I don't want to ruin it in this review. <br/><br/>Not only does the film work as a comedy, it also surprisingly works as a horror movie. There are plenty of jump scares and thrilling showdowns that awry during the course of this faux-apocalypse that will leave you on the edge of your seat and eagerly cackling with joy. <br/><br/>There isn't much I want to discuss anymore, because a movie like this is better off seen to be believed. What can I say? Sit back, relax and get ready to laugh your ass off."

","Jay Baruchel visits his friend Seth Rogen in Los Angeles, and Rogen drags him along to a celebrity party at James Franco's house even though Baruchel doesn't really want to go. While they are there, the apocalypse starts.<br/><br/>This comedy, co-written and co-directed by Rogen, features the usual suspects (Jonah Hill, Craig Robinson, Danny McBride) doing the usual foul-mouthed drug-riddled schtick, the wrinkle here being that they are playing fictional versions of themselves, in some cases drawn closely from the perceived persona of the individual, in others - notably Michael Cera - showing a diametric opposite.<br/><br/>It is tasteless, it is crude, it is crass and it is sometimes amusing (Emma Watson is a good joke), and it often shows evidence of not knowing what is funny, what isn't, and when enough is enough (Danny McBride in particular is given far too much rope). The carte blanch given to the cast to ad lib shows: this film often displays self-indulgence rather than a disciplined script. The apocalyptic effects are good.<br/><br/>If you like Rogen's work then you will probably like this. If you don't, then you definitely won't. If, like me, you are sometimes surprised that you enjoyed something of Rogen's which you expected not to, this film isn't one of those. I was hoping it would be funnier, but saying f*** 5 times doesn't make it 5 times funnier than saying it once."

Im not sure why many others loved it so much, the trailer was funnier than the actual film. Don't get me wrong, It does have its funny moments, but for me wasn't the level I hoped for, was only a few times I laughed a little. The film mainly centers on Jay and his relationship with Seth. But overall it tried too hard to be funny, and because of this it was just over the top and pretty stupid. There was way too much revolving around smoking weed and other drugs, and too much smack talking about penis sucking and semen. It was just not needed and it became really irritating, speaking of irritating, Danny McBride is, as always plain stupid and annoying as hell. The film has the same level of crude humour and sexual talk and penis's as Your Highness and the same amount of drugs as Pineapple Express. If you loved them movies then you'll enjoy this.

","I can watch anything that Seth Rogen does. So, when I found about about This is the End last year, I knew I had to be there. Then the reviews came out, and they were raving about it. You know what my thoughts were? ""Duh."" It sounded amazing. Is it amazing? Sort of. It's easily the year's best comedy. Here's a comedy that starts off funny, and really doesn't stop.<br/><br/>The film, which is written and directed by Rogen and collaborator Evan Goldberg, begins at a party at James Franco's house, where most of Rogen's friends (including a coked-out Michael Cera, Jason Segel, Kevin Hart, even Rihanna and Emma Watson) are. Then, next thing you know, the apocalypse is happening. And basically Franco, Rogen, Jay Baruchel (who is mainly the star here), Jonah Hill, Craig Robinson, and Danny McBride are trapped in the house, fighting for survival.<br/><br/>Here is a movie with a heck of a premise, and it does live up to it. But instead of playing the end of the world strictly for laughs, This is the End is actually sort of unique. Why? Because this time, the world isn't ending due to a natural disaster. I won't tell you what it is. But I will tell you that This is the End is actually sort of scary. Not because it's extremely realistic. But it is just sort of terrifying.<br/><br/>That said, it is hilarious. I can't think of more than 20 seconds where I was blank. It's a comedy that works for two main reasons: One, is the paragraph above. And the second, and probably the main reason, is because of the way the actors are portrayed on the screen. It really makes you wonder if Jonah Hill is this douche bag, or if Michael Cera is the coked-out pervert (I believe the first one, I highly doubt the second one).<br/><br/>I had a great time during this movie. It's easily the funniest comedy of the year so far. Not only that, it's the wildest, funniest, shocking, and most outrageous ride that I've been on in quite some time. It's a ton of fun to see these actors doing things we've never seen them do before. This is one of the best movies of the Summer so far. Hell, I would even say it's among the best movies of the year so far. I can't say it's Oscar worthy... but sometimes that just doesn't matter. It's a comedy, and a big one at that.<br/><br/>A-"

"PoisonKeyblade","10","8","27","14 June 2013"," Best Apocalyptic Comedy Ever
","A new comedy classic has arrived in Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg's masterful creation, This Is The End. The ultimate apocalypse movie with too many celeb/pop culture references to count, this is a film that can easily be considered the comedy of the year. Check out my full review.<br/><br/>James Franco is having a huge party at his place, and all his best buds are in attendance. Jay Baruchel is with his best bud Seth Rogen, but he's not big on the party scene and really isn't feeling much like staying. When the two take a trip to a store to blow off some steam, the apocalypse comes in terrifying fashion, complete with demons, rapture, hellfire, and sinkholes. <br/><br/>Going into the movie knowing very little about what to expect, I adored every moment of This Is The End. The direction is stellar and the music selection is comprised of tunes you won't soon be able to get out of your head. The six lead actors play off each other and every other actor to make an appearance in the film delivers, sometimes mocking themselves in highly memorable fashion. <br/><br/>For the first third of the film, Michael Cera kind of steals the show as a coked-out crazed version of himself, slapping around Rihanna and getting blown in Franco's bathroom. My favorite cameo comes by way of Channing Tatum, who clearly has a sense of a humor and has cemented my respect by appearing. There is also a certain boy band that cameos at the very end, bringing back a familiar 90's tune and ending the film on a high note.<br/><br/>More than the cameos, there is a ton to be said about the phenomenal performances from the six leads. It's difficult enough to maintain consistent character arcs, story, and one-liners with one two characters, let alone six. There is no clear stand-out among the group, as they all fight for the the title on more than one occasion. James Franco is super laid-back and obsessed with Seth Rogen. Jay Baruchel is best buds with Seth and has trouble trying to live with the rest of the crew. Craig Robinson tries to stay on everyone's good side. Seth Rogen is the same lovable character you'd imagine him to be in real life. Danny McBride is hated by everyone and causes a major rift amongst the others with his outlandish behavior, annoying none as much as he annoys James. Jonah Hill is overly nice to everyone around him and always sticking up for them. Throw these six people into one house with little food and water to spare during an apocalypse. What's the worst that can happen? Each actor seems to have a blast digging into each other and more than one joke is made at the expense of films they have done in the past. <br/><br/>This is a technically very well-made film as well as being solidly acted, and there are lines you will be quoting for days to come. I want to see it again, immediately. I still think I prefer the original title (Jay and Seth vs. The Apocalypse) but I'm totally okay with the new one as well, as it pretty accurately portrays the somber mood and gives you a hint of the darkly perfect comedy.<br/><br/>The horror elements of the movie are done very well and easily stay in sync with the comedy elements, which come fast and fresh. Once you hit the faux trailer for Pineapple Express 2, it's clear that This Is The End isn't slowing down any time soon. This is a movie to be remembered for years to come.

","This is the End (2013): Dir: Evan Goldberg, Seth Rogen / Cast: Seth Rogen, Jay Baruchel, James Franco, Jonah Hill, Danny McBride: The strangest apocalyptic comedy one could ask for. Featuring a cast of actors playing themselves as the Rapture has happened and a massive earthquake hits. Seth Rogen picks up Jay Baruchel at the airport but instead of an anticipated weekend of pot smoking it becomes a visit to James Franco's massive place where a huge celebrity party is taking place. When the earthquake hits nobody believes Baruchel when he claims that people were raptured up. A number of celebrities fall into a massive hole that becomes the pit of hell while a few selected celebrities take refuge in Franco's mansion. From there they struggle to survive as well as tolerate each other as demonic forces ravage the outside. Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg do an outstanding job directing as well as roping numerous celebrities into making fun of themselves. To pass time they decide to video a sequel to The Pineapple Express as well as deal with a demonic possessed Jonah Hill in hilarious references to The Exorcist and Rosemary's Baby. Danny McBride is a hilarious steal as the one guy who messes everything up to the point where they stage an intervention to vote him out. Clever writing make up for the fact that the humour is crass and the religious elements are sure to put off certain viewers. Still, the demonic creatures are a sell. The film makes fun of celebrities or self imposing lifestyles while its references to revelations carry some provocative thoughts that can open discussion with regards to the ultimate end. Score: 9 / 10"
"christophershobris","8","3","7","4 June 2015"," A Wonderful Surprise
","Before I saw this film I was pretty excited for the unique approach and possibilities that it brought upon itself. The idea of actors playing themselves in an Apocalyptic setup already had me laughing. But what I got was so much more then what I thought I was going to. This is The End offers a mixture of comedy, action, disaster, and horror film all wrapped into one unique and flavorful film. Furthermore, I hope they make more films like this where the actors play an exaggeration of themselves because it makes for some really great opportunities for some great comedy gold. Or at least really bright silver. However there are some issues thought. No movie is without flaws, but aside from that it is a good time to watch with friends or just by yourself. Either way, this film is worth buying at full price and a movie fit for a grand movie collection. Check it out, you won't be disappointed. Here are my grades for the film: Comedy: A Uniqueness: A+ Acting: A- Visual/Special Effects: B- Music: B Directing: A- Overall: A"
"geminiredblue","9","3","7","12 May 2015"," Hey, It's The Apocalypse... Let's Laugh!!!
","These days, movies about the end-of-the-world are a dime a dozen. If it's not raging zombies or terminators, then it's evil super villains. But what if... what if... the Apocalypse were to happen, with little to no warning? What would you do? In THIS IS THE END, one of the latest films from the Judd Apatow entourage, Seth Rogen and Jay Baruchel go to a party at James Franco's house. Soon after arriving, a giant sinkhole appears outside the front door. Many of the party-goers wind up falling in, leaving behind Rogen, Baruchel, Franco, Jonah Hill, Craig Robinson, and Danny McBride. Now, with the Apocalypse underway, the guys do their best at surviving. Inevitably getting on each other's nerves in the process. The humor, as with all their films, is an even mix of raunchy, usually sex-related, conversations and brilliant one-liners. Of the entire cast, I found Danny McBride the funniest, as well as the most antagonistic. Jay, as usual, is at his geekiest best. Of note, there are two scenes that stand out: 1) The death of Michael Cera and 2) The Exorcism of Jonah Hill. Both will have your sides splitting. For a mainstream movie, I was surprised by their attention to detail pertaining to a Biblical Apocalypse. Yes (Spoiler Alert) there is a Hell and a Heaven. And it's comforting to know that the Backstreet Boys made it!"
"Vartiainen","Null","3","7","15 May 2014"," Lackluster ode to douchebaggery
","This Is the End seems to be one of those comedy movies that believe idiots and arrogant assholes are funny. And granted, it manages to give more than valiant effort to support this claim. Most of its jokes are rather cringeworthy, but every now and then it will make you laugh.<br/><br/>So what's the story? Jay Baruchel, playing himself, has come to Hollywood to meet his old buddy Seth Rogen. Seth decides that they should go to James Franco's housewarming party, but while there the apocalypse happens. Props for imaginative setting and idea if nothing else. We have seen these ""actors playing outrageous versions of themselves"" films before, but never quite like this. It'd also be an easy guess to make that, taking place in the apocalypse, all these actors would play tough action hero versions of themselves, but actually no. The movie treats them as rather pathetic human beings, which is at times frustrating and at times funny.<br/><br/>The film's biggest flaw for me was the fact that none of the character were at all likable. Sure this is intentional in order to create comedy, but it's still hard to watch a movie where your most honest reaction to pretty much anything would be to hit the characters with a sledgehammer. Jay Baruchel is not as bad as the others and his down to earth performance saves a lot, but it alone is not enough to pull this film from the pit.<br/><br/>Still, in the end it's not a bad film. I'm sure it'd be outrageously funny if its kind of comedy is your thing. Furthermore, it's effects are surprisingly good for a comedy film, the plot is rather interesting and the characters feel like unique individuals. Not my personal cup of tea, so to speak, but I don't regret seeing it."
"grantss","3","3","7","30 March 2014"," Novel idea badly executed
","Novel idea badly executed. The idea of bringing as many Hollywood (and other) celebrities together in one movie, all playing themselves, often parodying themselves, was a great one. However that's about the only good thing about the movie.<br/><br/>Plot is poor, and not very original. The longer the movie goes on, the sillier it becomes. Yes, it is meant to be a comedy, but it's not that funny. Many of the ""jokes"" are quite juvenile.<br/><br/>Where the movie does have sparks of entertainment is when the original plan is adhered to, ie stars making fun of themselves. Any scene with Michael Cera was great, because of this.<br/><br/>Such scenes are few and far between, however, and often, instead of running each other down, many of the scenes just involve mutual back- slapping. Nothing personified this more than just about anything James Franco said in the movie. Also reminded me what a vastly overrated actor he is...<br/><br/>Talking performances, Seth Rogen, Jay Baruchel, Jonah Hill and Chris Robinson are okay, with Robinson being the pick of the bunch. As alluded to previously, James Franco is irritating, as always.<br/><br/>A wasted opportunity."
"axel-koch","2","3","7","1 February 2014"," An affront to good taste
","As I'm generally not inclined to use drugs and my cinema of choice is also not very lenient towards such stimulants, I went to watch this movie entirely sober and couldn't believe what I was seeing. Over a running time of 107 minutes, Seth Rogen and entourage take a toll on any lucid person's mind with This Is the End, a film explaining its one and only story arc in the title already, and is obviously the result of the exuberant intake of various narcotics.<br/><br/>To be fair, it takes until the second half of the film for it to fall apart completely, as the first part is just in the style of the average flick Rogen stars in – over the top, idiotic, and embarrassing, but at least smirk-worthy from time to time. After Emma Watson disappears again after a short and unnecessary cameo (that pertains to every single other cameo in the film, by the way) and the ominous foreshadowing of the title takes greater proportions though, there isn't anything to left to save This Is the End. Scatological humour, downright terrible special effects, unbearable cheesiness, and drugs and gore in superfluous abundance pile up to one of the hugest disappointments the film year 2013 has held for me.<br/><br/>Now when a bunch of celebrities meet up, dope themselves to mammoth highs, and then decide to have a whale of a time by making a fully ad- libbed film, who am I to bash them? It's just that the yield of this frenzy cannot possible be enjoyed as long as the same jag isn't reached by the audiences. Thus, if drugs aren't your cup of tea, This Is the End won't be either."

So from the beginning they keep making more and more lame lines (I am surprised how they find it funny unless they were all stoned during the movie) trying to be funny which fails the whole movie.

","I saw an advanced screening of This Is The End only last Friday, I thought I go since the previews looked good and the early reviews help set my mind on the film. I came into my cinema with high hopes and left with a big goofy smile with my body in pain from so much laughter (the best feeling ever!) Yep, this movie indeed is the best comedy of 2013!<br/><br/>The storyline is good if not the best ever for a comedy and the direction is pretty solid effort coming from both Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg (making their debut in directing). but what I love most about TITE is the casting of the actors and actresses playing as themselves, I felt it was a tough choice to choose who was the funniest of the bunch but Danny McBride, James Franco and Seth Rogen were the pick of my favourites.<br/><br/>Overall, I won't go into full spoiler mode in this review but I can highly recommend this movie if you are in dire need of a great laugh!

"Sergeant_Tibbs","7","3","7","26 June 2013"," Great fun. Takes me back the Rogen hits of 2007 and 2008.
","It's felt like forever since Seth Rogen and pals were on top of the comedy pedestal. In their wake they've left a vague area where I'm not even sure who's reigning it besides the odd one- hit wonder. While Knocked Up and The 40 Year Old Virgin have grown stale for me, Superbad and to a slightly guiltier extent Pineapple Express will always be some of my favourite comedies. It's great to see those casts reunited here especially for ""Pineapple Express 2."" Although Jay Baruchel has taken a long time to warm up to me, he really worked as the lead character here considering he hasn't participated much with the gang besides Knocked Up. I actually quite related with him which is a pleasure with a film like this, especially one that ends so epically. <br/><br/>Fortunately I really like the idea and I like the celebrities enough to go with their self- referencing humour, even when they're deliberately playing against type such as Michael Cera. It is hilarious for the most part but its biggest problem is the pacing and structure besides the odd unconvincing special effect. The film is presented in chunks and loose segments rather than having them on the journey to a particular thing. It isn't clear until about halfway through how the film could or should end, which makes it occasionally a drag (apparently they didn't know either and had to shoot the ending last minute). It's pretty good, but not quite up to Superbad or Pineapple Express level but perhaps this is a movie best enjoyed with big crowds so the laughs feel bigger and better. I wonder if Rogen and Goldberg have more up their sleeve before they exhaust their style.<br/><br/>7/10"
"hadhad83","10","6","19","16 June 2013"," Comic Brilliance
","This Is The End was hysterically funny at most times, and generally had the audience laughing throughout. Sure there's some rough language, some occasionally tasteless and almost juvenile humor, but it's all in good fun and it doesn't feel forced - all part of guys having a good time and making fun of celebrities. What was interesting was that for a comedy, there was a bit of a storyline, about friendships, about how they can stray and nearly fracture under stressful conditions.<br/><br/>All of the actors filled their parts well: Jonah Hill, Craig Robinson, Danny McBride, Jay Baruchel, Seth Rogen and James Franco were great as exaggerated versions of themselves. The actor cameos were great. Michael Cera was terrific as a coked out life of the party, and Emma Watson stole some of the comedy spotlight as an axe-wielding survivor taking on the guys.<br/><br/>Overall, a great laugh."
"cultfilmfreaksdotcom","7","6","19","12 June 2013"," A Worthy End
","Seth Rogen has been accused of always playing himself and now he's doing it for real. Wouldn't you know he's not much different from his fictional characters, but here's a much better movie than usual...<br/><br/>Meeting with buddy/actor Jay Baruchel, who's reluctantly flown to Los Angeles, the two hang out at Seth's pad, smoke pot and have intentionally banal conversations. This suits Jay just fine, but there's a big party being thrown by actor James Franco in his brand new super duper sized mansion.<br/><br/>The beginning of THIS IS THE END isn't very funny. With forced jokes and real life actors partying hard, the only true investment is the moping Jay, wanting nothing to do with anything Hollywood. His wish comes true but surely not in this fashion: When Jay and Seth go for cigarettes and munchies at the local liquor store, a formidable earthquake opens up the ground: people are either sucked inside fiery sinkholes or vacuumed into the heavens by bright blue laser beams.<br/><br/>Eventually the only worthwhile (yet literally God forsaken) humans left behind are as follows: Seth, Jay and their actor buddies Jonah Hill, Craig Robinson and James Franco, whose mansion has become a survival compound from outside elements including an unseen creature dwelling amongst the ravenous netherworld. Meanwhile, behind boarded up doors, the guys are still just as shallow yet their narcissistic diatribes are a little funnier now that there's something or everything to lose.<br/><br/>Danny McBride, who happened to crash out in Franco's bathroom the night before, turns up the next morning and becomes the party animal/loon our boys didn't need, but the audience will appreciate. From wasting rations of food and water to pleasuring himself at will, Danny's the kind of raunchy comic relief that this already raunchy comedy yearns for. Through his unpredictable behavior he even brings the gang closer together. Even HARRY POTTER ingénue Emma Watson turns up sporadically, and she's not to be messed with. <br/><br/>While the abundantly overboard humor is hit and miss, soul-searching dialogue tends to drone on, and several classic homages are wasted on younger audiences (like ROSEMARY'S BABY), the best aspects are the stuff we don't see at first What exactly is that roaring creature outside? Is this a biblical or zombie apocalypse, or both? And which actor will buy the farm?<br/><br/>In a nutshell, THIS IS THE END succeeds in what's gonna happen next And be prepared since just about everything does... and then some."

","After watching this movie, I was so sadly disappointed. This might actually be the WORST movie that I have ever seen. This movie should not deserve this high of a rating on IMDb or on any other other media source. TV has rated this move as the #1 comedy for 2 weeks, and I seriously did not laugh ONCE. They had to go to very low levels of prude and disgusting material in the effort to get cheap laughs. Lastly, it was very self-indulgent. I felt very uncomfortable throughout the movie and the relationships these characters were portraying. I am somewhat of a fan of James Franco (only Planet of the Apes) and Seth Rogen (only 50/50) but after seeing this movie, my desire to see another movie with one of them in it has drastically dropped. Don't see this movie...you will be very disappointed!"

When they woke up in the morning they all had copies of a ludicrous contract they could only get out of by death!

"movieman6-413-929510","5","0","0","2 February 2019"," An apocalyptic comedy
","This Is The End is a comedy film in which the world perishes. There are many actors in the film who just play themselves. Seth Rogan and Jay Baruchel go to a party at James Franco's house. While his and many other actors are partying, the world seems to perish. Most people die in the beginning or are sucked up by a blue ray. Only six actors remain and now try to ""survive"" the Apocalypse in James Franco's house. They begin to ridicule themselves and each other by making jokes about their lesser films. They also have to try to share their food, but when Danny McBride consumes the most and the rest is stolen by Emma Watson they have to go outside to get Franco's emergency supply. Outside they are attacked by demons, making survival a lot more difficult.
The film has a lot of humor, especially the part that makes the actors ridicule each other with their lesser films is funny when you recognize the particular films.
All actors do well, because they just play themselves with a certain characteristic. You can see that everyone in the film is enjoying themselves.
If you like comedy and know some of the actors in the film, the film can be entertaining."

"bowmanblue","7","0","0","19 October 2018"," Dumb, adult fun
","Every once in a while a film comes along that seems to have been made for such a 'niche' audience that I'm amazed it ever found its way into the mainstream cinema. 'This is the End' is one such film. The amount of areas of film and popular culture you have to be into to really appreciate this film knows no bounds. Basically, it's a group of comic actors who have appeared in a string of adult-natured comedies, playing - apparently exaggerated versions - of themselves during a party that happens to coincide with the end of the world.<br/><br/>To enjoy this film you're going to have to be okay with adult humour, bodily-function gags, appreciative of the humour of Seth Rogen, graphic violence, celebrities sending themselves up, frequent drug references i.e. 'stoner humour,' have at least a reasonable knowledge of Rogen's (and James Franco, Danny McBride, Jonah Hill to name but a few) filmic career, pop culture, comedy, sci-fi and general stupid movies that only exist to purely entertain and munch popcorn to. If you're into all those, give this one a watch. Luckily for me, I'm - believe it or not - able to appreciate all that, so I thought 'This is the End' was great!<br/><br/>I don't know why, but I'm a sucker for actors who play themselves in films and generally lampoon themselves. Here, so many famous faces send themselves up (and in a biblically-apocalyptic setting!) that I was in heaven (assuming that 'blue light' chose me... which it probably wouldn't). There's little to say about 'This is the End' apart from if you're into most or all of the themes I've mentioned then you're probably going to have a blast with this film. I know a lot of people will not like it and consider it a little too 'self-indulgent' from the actors, but I didn't care. You don't need much of a story when then (adult!) gags come thick and fast. Just put your brain on hold and enjoy spotting one cameo after the next."
"StevePulaski","9","7","24","15 June 2013"," A film lover's film
","This is the End does to raunchy comedies what The Cabin in the Woods did to horror films. It's a slick, subversive, wholly vulgar film that embraces its roots and emphasizes on the crudeness its actors are known to amplify. And amplify they do; this is one of the raunchiest films I've seen this year and also one of the funniest.<br/><br/>This has been a bad year for comedies; there's simply no other way to slice it. Mainstream comedies suffer from the ""maximum antics, minimum laughter"" formula, and all of them seem to take on over one-hundred minutes with only roughly fifty minutes of solid material. Just a few days ago I reviewed Rapture-Palooza, a dead-in-the-water comedy about the apocalypse and a young couple defeating the Anti-Christ. That film's obsession with vulgarity and raunchiness way senseless and gratuitous. It could be said that This is the End features vulgarity that is gratuitous as well, but it certainly makes better use of it and finds a way to incorporate the excessive swearing to great comedic effect. Rapture-Palooza did it in a way that felt like a group of twelve year olds that just found out a slew of four-letter words.<br/><br/>The film's story is basic, but viable; it stars Seth Rogen, Jay Baruchel, Jonah Hill, Craig Robinson (who was unfortunately victim to both Peeples and the aforementioned Rapture-Palooza this year, and Danny McBride who join James Franco's lavish home for a house-warming party. All the actors play simplified, egotistical versions of themselves as they party the night away along with many other actors from Michael Cera to Rihanna. Out of the blue, the Apocalypse sets in, sinkholes form, things explode, etc, and the group of actors find themselves stranded and left to fight for themselves in the face of chaos and violence.<br/><br/>Many of us have likely seen some of these actors in other films. Seeing them all together, not playing characters, but themselves (regardless of how unrealistic they are) is simply a terrific concept. Similar to, yes, The Avengers, the large group of comedians joining each other on-screen feels welcoming and pleasant, but also slightly contentious as they seem to try and one-up each other constantly. Not to mention, they are a boiling-pot of narcissists, which shockingly works at the comic flame of writers Rogen and Evan Goldberg. I just hope we're laughing at stupid archetypes and not authentic portrayals.<br/><br/>One catch with the film that didn't seem to be marketed in the trailer is that this is a film lover's film. This is a picture that is very self-referential and extremely satisfying to someone who has followed mainstream comedies in the last six or seven years. The references to movies past, the brought-up possibilities of sequels, the hilarious banter between cast members, and the terrific in-jokes only some of the audience will understand truly make this a fanboy's comedy. As someone who has paid close attention to comedies of the last few years - what with the huge rise and success of R-rated comedies that pack in hilarity and humanity - this was an enormous delight.<br/><br/>And the talent certainly helps too. The always likable Seth Rogen and James Franco play terrific goofball stoners, the underrated Jay Baruchel does some great work with his outgunned/inferiority-conflict, Jonah Hill never disappoints as usual, Craig Robinson, finally, is recognized as the fun and lively comedic talent he is, and Danny McBride is simply hilarious in the role of the lame-brained slacker who can't do right. In addition, cameos by Michael Cera as a sex/coke addict and Rihanna are a laugh-riot.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the excursion is rewarding and fun. Its two hour run time may seem flabby, especially considering when the Apocalypse starts to really ruin the lives of the main cast it becomes a bit humorless and redundant, but the dry sections are mere minutes while the laughs are uproarious and surprisingly constant. Directors Rogen and Evan Goldberg (writers/directors of Superbad) brilliantly hold their ground and balance everyone's comedic talent wonderfully. The entire product is light years more durable and serviceable than the average Apocalyptic-fare. I think the second people I'd want to spend the Apocalypse with besides my family are these guys.<br/><br/>Starring: Seth Rogen, Jay Baruchel, James Franco, Jonah Hill, Craig Robinson, Danny McBride, Emma Watson, Michael Cera, Rihanna, Aziz Ansari, and Kevin Hart. Directed by: Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg."
"preston-luther","8","7","24","13 June 2013"," This is the End Review
","""This is the End"" is a movie based on a short story titled ""Seth and Jay vs. the Apocalypse"" that one can only assume was concocted under the influence of sensory enlightening drugs. The story involves a group of comedy stars who play themselves as they attempt to survive the sudden onset ofuhoh who cares? As long as we understand that some threat has forced guys such as Seth Rogen, James Franco, Danny McBride, Jonah Hill, Craig Robinson, etc. to barricade themselves within Franco's new mansion. This of course provides the majority of the comedy fodder.<br/><br/>The actors all play cinematic versions of themselves which I believe provides a comedic charm for ""This is the End."" Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg loosely wrote the screenplay, forcing the actors to improvise a good majority of their dialogue. This functions splendidly in that it allows for guys like McBride and Rogen to fulfill their normal on-screen personalities. And have no fear, the raunchy vulgarity comes full force in a series of scenes involving characters forced to confront each other in hilariously crude arguments. <br/><br/>What makes the movie's vulgarity funny and not offensive is that it is motivated vulgarity rather than vulgarity for its own sake. Consider the situation of the characters. They've locked themselves inside a house with limited supplies. Their arguments revolve around their surviving this unknown threat that has attacked the world. Their jokes and jibes come in the context of survival, in which they would say or do anything to avoid their death, or I suppose damnation in this case. It is crudeness with purpose and reason behind it.<br/><br/>For much of the film the characters are isolated from the world, in fact the only evidence of the apocalypse we view is reduced to snippets of Los Angeles on fire. But Rogen and Goldberg realize the strength of their script lies not so much in story or plot so much as its characters and their interactions with each other, hence much of what we see focuses on the characters in isolation with each other, in which they claw at each other's throats through crude mockery. Fortunately, there is just enough of both story and plot, which is the key to any successful raunchy comedy. Who cares about the strength of the story in a movie that does not require an intricate plot? As long as some form of backbone exists within the movie to carry the gags, the entertainment factor is there. Much credit for the film I believe goes to its actors, who each deliver performances that deprecate themselves and each other to the point of hilarity, where we overlook perceived flaws involving the mechanics of the movie."
"coltsfan18288","8","7","24","13 June 2013"," Not consistently funny, but has its hilarity
","If you like more than 2 of the actors in here, you'll like this movie bits not funny consistently, but when a joke hits it's hilarious. Maybe about 15 minutes too long and a few too many penis jokes for my taste (and I'm an 18 year old guy) but it was entertaining in a year of bad comedies and makes you what to be a better person (if only to survive the Apocalypse). Rogen and Goldberg show they can direct the hell out of a movie, and not just the comedy scenes. There are some genuinely frightening scenes in this film and they are executed very well. Just overall a fun film and goes to show a film about celebrities hanging out can be funny for audience members, too (here's looking at you, ""Grown Ups"")."
"thejoshl","8","6","20","15 June 2013"," This isn't just one of the best comedies I've ever seen but one of the best disaster movies as well.
","That's right, the most outrageous movie of the summer that has comedians playing themselves in an over the top end of the world scenario that's made up of at least 30% dick jokes, manages to be one of smartest, most heartfelt comedies to come out in years. This isn't just one of the best comedies I've ever seen but one of the best disaster movies as well. What could possibly test friendship better than the apocalypse?<br/><br/>This is one of those films that's so ridiculous on the surface it's bound to cause walkouts all across the country as well people who will consider this film merely a guilty pleasure. It's unfortunate that this is the case because if you can look beyond This Is The End's shocking exterior you can see a true story of friendship and morality.<br/><br/>The greatest thing about This Is The End is even though they present us with so many different types of humor going on within each form, whether it is in the acting, writing or editing they have a way of hitting their mark and quickly moving on to the next one. Even if you're aware of where the joke is going they hit you with the punch line a second sooner than you're expecting; this makes even the predictable gags unpredictable.<br/><br/>The main thing I was worried about in this movie was the story. The trailer sold me on the comedy, I knew it would be funny but the story was going to going to make or break it. The apocalypse isn't just a gag in the film it really is a disaster movie; so with the end of the world taken seriously the comedy can latch onto the plot and take off in all directions.<br/><br/>I know it seems ridiculous to suggest there is good acting in a movie where all the actors are playing exaggerated versions of themselves but I'm going to do it anyway. It's hard to differentiate in a piece like this how much was written vs. how much improvised however the amount that at least appeared improvised was very impressive. A prime example of this is when James Franco is upset about Danny McBride's poor handling of his porno magazine; the dialogue back and forth is so outrageous and immature that initially I was surprised the scene made it in the film and then it just goes on and on and the pacing makes it all the funnier. If you watch closely there's a shot during the scene that's over the shoulders of Danny and Seth and you can see Seth turn away from the actors and laughing. If you can make Seth Rogen laugh at his own movie you're doing something right.<br/><br/>Through all the hilarity that takes place in This Is The End, never for a second does it forget what it's trying to show us. The moral of the film is strangely religious and the answer they give us in solving all the pain and suffering in the world will take you into heaven dying with laughter.<br/><br/>Visit http://themoviebloggers.com/ for more reviews."
"clintoc","10","6","20","15 June 2013"," Even better than expected
","So I was excited about this movie, but I had my doubts. There were a lot of things that could go wrong. There is always that dilemma about how to act as ones self. However, I thought the acting was nearly perfect. They were normal enough to make it believable, but extreme enough to be hilarious. Obviously Danny McBride probably isn't as nuts in real life as he was in this movie, but he was believable, I believed him.<br/><br/>All the characters personalities fit together so well and there was so many moments in this movie. You can relate to your own group of friends in ways and its just a really good movie. The special effects were also much more than I expected for a comedy. I think they went all out on this movie and got a really good result. I can't believe there are negative reviews. Even people who don't like this kind of humor can't give it any lower than a 4!"
"enderwilliam22","10","6","20","15 June 2013"," Absolutely Hysterical!!
","Comedies are always hit or miss, you either like them or you don't. But, if you are a fan of movies like 21 Jump Street, The Hangover, and other R- Rated comedies, you will probably find this movie hilarious! The idea of it is unique, having actors play themselves. This way, you can really see how much fun the actors had making this, and the jokes feel a lot more natural, none seem forced and it's equivalent to spending a fun night with your friends. Also, the script was very well written and creative, the writers were able to make a hysterical comedy out of the Rapture, and poke fun at religion. That being said, if you are uptight or very religious, this is definitely not the movie for you. But, if you are a fan of dirty, raunchy, and offensive humor (again, movies like the Hangover), I guarantee you'll find this movie hilarious. The jokes never let up, while all might not hit, you'll easily be able to find hilarious lines that you won't forget. This is the End is an original and non-stop laugh-fest!"
"joshuawyman9797","8","6","20","15 June 2013"," This is the End is a thinly written but hilarious comedy that examines how a group of celebrities would behave during the apocalypse.
","The film mostly takes place at James Franco's mansion. Jay Baruchel is visiting his long-time friend, Seth Rogen in LA. Although the two have a very close bond, Jay seems to dislike Seth's new ""Hollywood"" lifestyle, and is very resistant towards attending a house-warming party at James Franco's house. At the party, numerous actors (Emma Watson, Rihanna and Jason Segal to name a few) engage in an evening of debaucheries, filled with drugs, alcohol and sex. During the party, sudden mass beams of light begin pulling people into the sky, while the rest of the world goes into chaos. The majority of the party guests die in a sink-hole outside of Franco's house, while the remaining survivors (Baruchel, Rogen, Hill, Robinson and Franco) and an unwanted guest must now survive the apocalypse.<br/><br/>The movie is consistently funny, with a variety of gut-busting scenes and quotes that will be referenced for years to come. The actors' commitment to their roles is what makes this movie really work. The actors are fully engaged in the absurdity of the film. Even though most of them have had very successful careers, they were not afraid to participate in outrageous dialogue and scenes; such as, a two-minute argument on ejaculation and porn magazines; a ""coked-up"" Michael Cera; and a scene where one of the actors is raped by a demon. The self- deprecating humor was the best part of the movie, as the actors were not afraid to mock themselves and many of the stereotypes associated with young Hollywood actors.<br/><br/>Great comedies are often remembered for their hilarious plots; while the jokes, one-liners and gags are simply used to enhance the movie-going experience. This is the End had many hilarious jokes, but a very formulaic and uneventful plot. The premise of a group of actors, playing fictional versions of themselves, surviving the apocalypse in James Franco's mansion is brilliant and original. On the other hand, after the hilarity of the premise wears off, the film delves into ridiculous scenarios for the actors to do silly things; while ignoring character development and an interesting progression in the story. The film eventually becomes a series of repetitive gags; even though most of them work, they eventually become repetitive and sometimes boring.<br/><br/>This is the End is the funniest movie I have seen since the first Hangover. I highly recommend this movie for fans of Seth Rogen and Judd Apatow films, and comedy in general. I had a wonderful time watching this movie, even though the thin plot caused some the fun to wear off.<br/><br/>Don't forget to check out my blog: 'Til Film Do Us Part<br/><br/>http://tilfilmdouspart.blogspot.ca/"

","This movie is funny, like really funny. As I'm sure you know from the trailers it's a bunch of young Hollywood actors playing themselves as they attend a party at James Francos house and suddenly find themselves in the middle of a biblical apocalypse. The movie works so audaciously well because the events happening although outlandish take themselves pretty seriously. So in essence like Shaun of the Dead it's just a bunch of funny actors playing versions of their real selves dealing with it as if it were really going on. The main ones are James Franco, Seth Rogen, Jay Baruchel, Craig Robinson, Jonah Hill and Danny McBride. Many other celebrities show up for the festivities like Michael Cera ( a scene stealer), Channing Tatum, Rihanna, Mindy Kailing and so many more. Many jokes are made at their expense and it culminates into a bizarre, wild experience unlike anything you've seen before. A smart script and smarter direction compliment the material and although it feels a bit long especially for a movie of this type you'll find it hard to see something funnier or more clever this year! 4/5"

Improvisation made this movie, and characters did pull off being realistic.

That was the trap, because what seemed like an hour later I was still sitting there waiting for this movie to end -- OR get funny again, one of the two.

","Sometimes the best ideas are the simplest ones, that come to you while having a drink with friends at a bar. Unlike this groups other films, the story and plot aren't the focus here. This Is The End features a ton of Hollywood's top comedic stars, playing extremely stereotypical version of themselves. Their characters are based on rumors, gossip, and over exaggerations of their true persona's, resulting in a hilarious film, that not only delighted their fans, but also gave a huge middle finger to the paparazzi. The film starts with Jay Baruchel visiting Seth Rogen in L.A. Baruchel, a notorious introvert, wants to stay in, but Rogen wants to go to James Franco's housewarming party. Reluctantly the pair agree to go to the big time Hollywood shindig, when the fun is interrupted by the apocalypse, and I don't mean a zombie one, the actual end of the world. The pampered actors find themselves in a fight for survival in the home of James Franco. The whole cast was hilarious and while watching it you realize that the characters they develop really aren't that dissimilar from who they really are. Jay Baruchel surprised me, as I knew very little about him, besides his awkward performance in She's Out of League. I haven't really seen him as more than a ancillary character, and it was really fun to see him fit in with the gang. Rogen, Hill, Franco, and Robinson don't disappoint, giving you exactly what you'd expect from them, and unfortunately so does Danny McBride. I really don't get the appeal of this guy! He is way over the top, super annoying, and just a big dumb redneck, that just doesn't seem to fit in with the likes of these comedic geniuses. If I had the choice I'd much rather have had Michael Cera or Paul Rudd trapped with them instead of McBride, who didn't get more than an annoyed grunt out of me. This Is The End is a very funny film, wrapped in an awful story, but it gives great insight into the personalities of some of our favorite actors and that really is the whole point of this film. It's just one of those things that either you'll get it and love it, or you won't."

","A movie that offered so much that delivered so little. The make up of the cast had been in some of my favourite comedy movies, so no wonder my expectations were so high. Unfortunately, they were not met, the odd laugh here and there was not good enough, considering the cast. The idea that having the 'Actors' play themselves was brilliant, which lead me to think that they would 'act' how they would in real life, which again wasn't the case, with most of them acting like characters they had played in other movies (except Michael Cera, who was the complete opposite, but then again, would he really be like that). In the end it seemed like there was a hidden message in this film, and that was that we need to start being nicer otherwise we are all going to get butt raped by satin while we sleep (or something like that) and if we start being nice now we will all be saved. I don't expect that kind of message from Hollywood, shame on you! Maybe worth the one watch, but maybe while you're doing other mundane tasks like the hovering or ironing your washing."

","When you start out with such an array of actors whom you know will bring the humor u want to see in a movie, and they do, you will definitely like this film. The first thing that made me want to watch the movie was the cast of this film. And it's also appropriate to say that i did have a lot of expectation from the movie and the actors. To my delight this movie didn't turn out to be like any other comedy movie as the actors were playing themselves, which made the movie even more funnier. <br/><br/>I was thrown back by the development of the plot. It literally blew my mind when everything took a turn for the worse. One minute Seth and Jay are in the party, then they go to the store and BAM! this plot development to me seemed pretty impressive as i was unaware that this was an ""apocalyptic"" comedy film.<br/><br/>the second thing about this movie that took me by surprise was Emma Watson. Watching her grow up as Hermione you don't expect to see Emma Watson in such movies. Well her appearance after the calamity was one of the many hysterical moments during which, dare I say, Laughed My Ass Off.<br/><br/>Besides Danny McBride's and Jonah Hill's episode, the movie seemed to adhere to the general theme of a post Apocalypse situation and the struggle to survive.Although i can never get the image of Jonah Hill being abused and Channing Tatum becoming a slave out of my head as easily as other parts of the movie.<br/><br/>Although the movie seemed to have been terse on the ending, it was a good laugh after so many days. I would recommend people to watch this film, probably with other friends and with some weed to take this amazingly hilarious movie to a ""higher"" level."

","This Is the End begins like most of its stoner/sex/gross-out comedy cousins. (You can read our take on Superbad or Pineapple Express for a quick reference.) Only in this case a gaggle of a-list Hollywood comedians and recognizable entertainment pretty people—from James Franco and Seth Rogen to Emma Watson and Rihanna—all play ""themselves"" as they wallow in booze, drugs and casual-cool sleaze.<br/><br/>About 10 or 15 minutes in, though, this seemingly formulaic foul flick gets twisted: The ground starts shaking and splitting open, cars crash, people scream, fires rage and the party's Hollywood locale is quickly transformed into a netherworld of rancid smoke, demonic beasts and open sinkholes to hell.<br/><br/>It's a surprise genre blending that springs from a 2007 short called Jay and Seth vs. The Apocalypse. Never heard of it? Well, that's because it never saw the light of day beyond a rough-edged YouTube trailer. But that was not the end, as we now can clearly see.<br/><br/>The special-effects-laden end result of turning that short into a feature is  unique, with ""Is there a God?"" ruminations and the supernatural rapture of believers getting mangled and mashed up with graphic nudity, lengthy arguments about masturbation and ejaculation, drugged-out binges and rapid-fire f-bombs.<br/><br/>A postscript: The Los Angeles Times is reporting that directors Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg were actually expecting an initial NC-17 rating for this movie. And that they ""didn't just expect their raunchy Judgment Day comedy to be slapped with an NC-17 rating—they secretly planned on receiving the adults-only rating.  Acting on the advice of distributor Sony Pictures, Rogen and Goldberg intentionally larded the film with a few sexually explicit frames that they felt certain would shock the movie ratings panel and result in an NC-17 mark."" Then they were reportedly planning to snip out a few of the most offensive segments and re-submit for a more marketable R, raking in free publicity along the way. But the result was an R rating right out of the gate, with no edits required.<br/><br/>According to the Times, ""The decision stunned Rogen and Goldberg. 'All the ratings stuff doesn't make sense in the first place, but this is like ludicrous,' Goldberg said. Added Rogen: 'We actually made it even a little worse than we wanted and that version got approved. Insanely, we didn't have a ratings issue.'"""

","First off, I have to say I'm fully behind a film like this in principle. Friends got together and convinced a studio to back them goofing around, being themselves. Is there an element of self-satisfaction about playing yourself? Yes definitely. Is it crass and stupid in spots? Again yes. But I like the loose structure, the fact that you can tell a lot was improvised on the spot. That they play themselves as stoned geeks who are in a geeky sci-fi movie about the end of the world, intending it for an audience of likeminded geeks.<br/><br/>And yet it doesn't fully satisfy. It's in the nature of improv that not all of it will pan out, not talking about a few flat jokes here. It's that they can't help being bros, not very imaginative. Putting monsters in there doesn't count as imagination in my book. I just think they could have pushed themselves more, gone out of artistic comfort zones, fooled with their selves, done more with the hallucinations. I guess part of the joke is that they can't act and are really playing variations of themselves each time, something mentioned in just the first scene. You can even see that a lot of their improv is pretty bad, lots of smirks they can't hide. Or does that make it good?<br/><br/>Am I salivating at the prospect of this movie done by Korine? Just an extended party montage at the house. You bet."

If you are looking for an evening of casual and funny eye candy, then you might have a winner here.<br/><br/>The casting for the movie seems clear enough to me. Put some successful comedy actors together in a small space (which is actually quite a big house, I know) and let the almighty apocalypse destroy everything around them but themselves, throw in a cheesy moral and make sure the movie is fast-paced with a lot of wtf-moments in between. What could possibly go wrong? Exactly, not a lot. Sure the humor and jokes are cliché, but I would say that is exactly what they wanted it to be.<br/><br/>Some people have obviously failed to see the sarcasm and self-ridiculing that's done by all the actors. They are really taking a swing at the Hollywood lifestyle and actors. I for one was pleasantly surprised by this and I really appreciate the effort Seth Rogen put into this. It is exactly what I wanted and expected it to be and I would definitely recommend this to several of my friends.

","""This Is The End"" (15) Director: Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen. Starring: Jay Baruchel, Seth Rogen, James Franco and Jonah Hill. Running time: 107 minutes.

Then cabin fever sets in. <br/><br/>Comedy's of recent years have mainly been party or romantically based. A fresh take on the genre has been long overdue; the ""Hangover"" series has shed some light on that but nothing has broken down barriers quite like ""This Is The End"". <br/><br/>From the writers of ""Superbad"", ""This Is The End"" dares to kill off A- list stars, include religion and even show a rape scene by a demon. It really is a comedy that raises the bar. All the actors play themselves which is quite interesting and fresh. Most of the laughs from the film, relies on self-parody, for example the group of friends (real Hollywood actors) accuse each other of making bad films, for example Seth Rogen and ""The Green Hornet"". <br/><br/>After a while, some jokes just become reliant on sexual innuendos, which is a shame as the rest of the film works perfectly well as a dark and satirical film. The acting is good and the cast look as though they are having a great time, in the roles which they pretty much play in real life. <br/><br/>It has it's highs and lows, but I am confident that ""This Is The End"" is one of this summers best comedies, if not for a long time. <br/><br/>4 STARS<br/><br/>Written by Scott Gentry."
"filmtrance","8","3","8","29 July 2013"," The funniest film of the year so far.
","Seth Rogen has always been the subject of debate when it comes to how funny his scripts and he actually are. There can be no argument, however, about the success of his latest comedy: This is the End. Written and directed by Rogen and Evan Goldberg, who has worked with Seth on a number of projects such as Superbad, Pineapple Express, Knocked Up and Green Hornet, the latest film stars a number of high profile celebrities who are faced with an apocalypse after attending a house party hosted by James Franco.<br/><br/>The wage bill for this movie spared no expense with the inclusion of mega stars such as Seth Rogen, Jay Baruchel, James Franco, Danny McBride, Craig Robinson, Jonah Hill, Emma Watson, Channing Tatum, Jason Segel, Paul Rudd, Michael Cera, Christopher Mintz-Plasse and pop star Rihanna who all play fictional versions of themselves. It seems to have paid off though given that in its first month it has grossed just shy of $80 million.<br/><br/>What makes up for the obvious flaws in this film is the fact that it does exactly what it intends to do which is make you laugh. There are some truly hilarious moments during This is the End for various reasons. Firstly, Michael Cera plays a drug fuelled version of himself that forces everyone at the party to hate him which is so different to the Michael Cera we all know. Then there's the spoof of the Exorcist, possibly the greatest horror film of all time. The re-enactment of the famous 'Power of Christ' scene is side splittingly funny due to the twist on words and implements used. What really makes the film work though is how everyone is willing to make a mockery of their career. Every actor's stereotypes are brought to the table and made into a joke. Seth Rogen is the man who plays the same role every time, Jonah Hill is America's 'sweetheart', James Franco has had indiscretions with high profile stars and it goes like this for the whole cast.<br/><br/>This is, by far, the funniest comedy of 2013 so far. It does use the type of comedy that certain people find boring these days given how over used it can be but with this scenario and the actors involved, it just works. You just have to accept This is the End for what it is: not a film with any depth to the story but a massive spoof involving many Hollywood stars that we love or hate."
"The-Sarkologist","9","3","8","29 July 2013"," An Awesome parody of Hollywood, and rapture films
","This movie is seriously messed up (I would use a stronger adjective but IMDb would probably object). Basically it is about a bunch of actors who play themselves caught up at the end of the world. To so that it is hilarious is an understatement, but then again the humour isn't necessarily intelligent, but rather incredibly crude. However, that, to me, does not necessarily detract from they movie because I did find myself laughing quite loudly through the movie.<br/><br/>Many have suggested that maybe this movie is blasphemous, and in a way it probably is, but to be honest with you I really don't care. Personally, this movie is simply a lot of fun, and simply pokes fun at the acting profession. For instance, Craig Robinson's quote 'we're actors, were soft' referring to the fact that while they might play tough guys, in reality they are far from being tough.<br/><br/>Mind you, I might actually suggest that there is more theological truth in this movie that one would actually expect, despite the incredible crudeness. For instance, when talking about God and Jesus Christ, Jay says 'No, Jesus and God are the same, there's the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit' (to which James Franco then pops up and says 'like Neopolitan ice cream'). Then there is the idea of getting into heaven. They spend the entire movie trying to work it out, and it is only when they either sacrifice themselves for the sake of another (as Craig Robinson does) or show forgiveness where it is not deserved (as Jay does) that they are then caught up into heaven (though not theologically correct, this is actually a lot more that a lot of people who go around calling themselves Christians do).<br/><br/>What I really liked about the film was how the actors pretty much played themselves (or rather a parody of themselves). It is interesting that how after the rapture the who's who of Hollywood pretty much did not realise that anything had actually happened, and when the ground does start shaking, they all run out to be mostly gobbled up in a pit that goes straight to hell. Micheal Cera gets it in the the neck (which probably has something to do with Year One, though I am sure God will accept his apology that that particularly terrible film), and a group manage to survive, all trapped in James Franco's house. So what we have is the classic tale of a group of people (apparently friends, but in situations such as these friendships tend to be tested, and the worst, and the best, end up coming out of them).<br/><br/>This film is a parody, and a pretty good parody at that. Sure, it parodises those apocalyptic mostly Christian films such as Left Behind, but it also parodies the Hollywood scene. The fact that there is a suggestion that nobody in Hollywood will actually be caught up in the rapture is pretty damning in itself. The other aspect is simply that hell actually isn't a nice place, but Heaven, well, that place is pretty cool. The fact that when all of the Christians (or at least the good hearted people) are caught up at the beginning also goes to show that after they are all gone, the the world is simply not going to be a nice place to live in anymore."

","When I saw the first trailer for This is the End I knew this was going to be great and a movie for me. Seth Rogan and James Franco did not disappoint. This was the best movie I have seen all year by far. The plot is basic but the end result is hysterical. Seth Rogan, James Franco, Danny McBride, Jonah Hill, Craig Robinson, and Jay Baruchel are trying to survive the apocalypse in the home of James Franco. The twist is that the actors are playing themselves and that gimmick worked better than I could have imagined. <br/><br/>Before seeing this movie I had my honest worries. When a big group of celebrities come together for a movie like this one of two things can happen. One, it will be a huge success and a comedic masterpiece, or two, there will be way too many stars and it will be a mess like Movie 43. Luckily almost everything in this movie worked. The constant movie references were perfect for a movie lover like me. I am a big fan of these actors and their movies. I wasn't a huge fan of Pineapple Express but I loved Freaks and Geeks. The constant posters and actors of Freaks and Geeks in the background were subtly hilarious. I was also a little worried about some of the characters but each of them worked and was funny in their own way.<br/><br/>In the beginning of the movie Jonah Hill was kind of annoying. With the introduction of his character I was afraid of something I like to call the Grown Ups affect. Meaning, the writers make that one guy who isn't funny on purpose like they did with Rob Schneider. Jonah Hill was annoying and at first I didn't like his character but he grew on me and grew on me and he was a star in the movie. Danny McBride was the hero of this movie however. Danny McBride is so good at what he does. He played the same character in this movie as he does in every other accept its better. He is a jerk but he is such a funny jerk. His first scene is hysterical where he cooks all the food and rips apart all the other actors. He and Franco have great scenes and the scene with the gimp almost had me on the floor crying with laughter. Danny McBride was easily my favorite character but picking out a favorite scene was impossible.<br/><br/>At first my favorite scene was with Michael Cera. His scenes with him on coke were too funny for film. This was the first role I liked Michael Cera in. If you know me then you know I don't like Michael Cera but everything he did in the move was solid gold. Even his blazer was funny. He was beyond satisfying and whoever came up with the idea of him on coke deserves an Oscar. My favorite scene turned into Danny McBride eating the food, then the scene with Emma Watson, then the sequel to Pineapple Express, then the gimp, and so on. In the end I can't choose a favorite scene. Everything in this movie worked and it had a good story to back it up.<br/><br/>The story was basic but carried out perfectly. The movie was in James Franco's house for most of the movie and that was perfect. Having the main characters going thru the city, running into other actors with pointless cameos would have been a disaster. There were many cameos in the movie but none of them were too much to handle. Rhianna Aziz Anzari, Paul Rudd, Channing Tatum Martin Starr, and so many others had just enough screen time to be funny and not take the focus off the main characters. A few references went over my head because I didn't know all the material Seth Rogan could have drew from but I got most of it. The friction between Jay and the rest of the group was a well written conflict added to the story and the characters were done well enough to get an emotional connection to. From the start the movie was funny. Jay and Seth have a weird conversation about glutton and it was so simple but funny. The writing in this movie had Seth Rogan's name all over it. He is such a good writer and he knows how to write a funny script. The random conversations from a milky way bar to the best way to drive in the Hollywood hills the writing in this movie was like no other. The words were more funny then the actions. Franco carries around a prop gun and the scene when they are passing it around and Jonah pretends to shoot was hysterical but not as funny as Jonah Hill praying to God to kill Jay. The writing reminded me of Tarantino's writing and everybody knows I idolize him. Overall, I feel like This is the End was made for me. It is a movie I always wanted made. I always thought it would be a good idea to have a movie where actors play themselves and even though they played exaggerated versions of themselves it still worked. This is the funniest movie I have seen in a long time and is probably in my top 5 favorite comedies. The writing was brilliant, the actors were funny, the scenes were memorable, the lines are quotable, and the movie itself was all around great. I will but this on blu ray the day it is released and I will watch it again and again. I will admit that this movie is not for everybody and I understand if you did not like it. Fans of Seth Rogan and his comedy will love this movie. This is the End easily gets the WillyT Comedic Crest, which is the highest rating for a comedy, and obviously gets the WillyT Seal of Approval."

","This film is NOT for everyone.<br/><br/>It's like ghost busters on steroids, with a bad attitude.<br/><br/>This film takes risks that other films refuse to take. It can be raunchy, crude, NOT for the squeamish or sensitive, and absolutely hysterical. This film will challenge your comedic sensibilities, and while the jokes and gags don't always work, they hit far more often than they miss, and they hit HARD.<br/><br/>Seth Rogen, Craig Robinson, Danny McBride and the entire cast, should pat themselves on the back for a job well done. This movie, and this comedy crew, took a LOT of comedic risks throughout the film, and in most cases, those risks are rewarded with some big laughs.<br/><br/>Concerns of self indulgent narcissism on the part of the cast did NOT pan out on the screen. I never got the vibe that the cast was doing anything other than trying to sincerely put on the best comedic performance that they could. <br/><br/>Danny McBride deserves an Oscar for his performance. Period. NOBODY can do the crazy things he does, or deliver the crazy lines he does, with such commitment and conviction. He boldly goes where comedians fear to travel, and he somehow manages to make you laugh at things you wouldn't laugh at had it been another comedian. In this film, he makes ""Kenny Powers"" seem tame.<br/><br/>Craig Robinson, Seth Rogen, and James Franco, all deliver some serious laughs. <br/><br/>Jonah Hill nails his part with a sledgehammer.<br/><br/>I found that this movie was able to change tones and make transitions from one genre to another the way few movies can. The film FEELS like a comedy, and then it interjects horror aspects way beyond the typical ""comedy/horror"" film so as to lose any semblance of ""comedy"", and it becomes legitimately ""horrifying"". Then, it transitions back to ""comedy"" with something truly gut-bustingly funny. This film is like a roller coaster.<br/><br/>This film goes too far. Too often. However, you can't get the kind of payoffs these boys get UNLESS you are willing to step across a few lines. These boys leap across those lines, and the rewards were well worth the risk.<br/><br/>If you enjoy having your sensibilities challenged, and laughing hysterically, this film WILL deliver. <br/><br/>Just don't be surprised when you find yourself laughing at things you thought you normally wouldn't. Like, say, a giant demon creature with a giant smoldering.....well, just see for yourself.<br/><br/>9 of 10 stars."

I loved this movie and it was possibly one of my favorite comedies of all time, it was fantastic and that is why It deserves a ten. Better than any other comedy that I have seen in a long time, I will buy this on DVD. Seth Rogen and Evan have brought us a comedy that I believe will be timeless and a comedy classic, if you have time I completely recommend you watch this comedic masterpiece because you will not be disappointed.

","This Is the End is a brilliant movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding comedic cast. It's a very well written storyline that see's Seth Rogen and his usual group of friends finding themselves put in to an apocalyptic adventure, it's a laugh riot from start to finish, there were very few scenes that didn't have me in stitches. The huge cast all do a fantastic job, everyone plays an exaggerate version of themselves to full effect, they weren't afraid to make fun of each other and also making them look like horrible people, a dedicated cast all around make this a winner. The movie is also surprisingly stunning at a visual aspect, Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen put a lot of work in to bringing this project to life, the effects are phenomenal and the film looks a lot more expensive that you would have expected. A very fun comedy that I hope to watch again and again, if you're a fan of satire or Seth Rogen, you are going to love This is the End, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good comedy. <br/><br/>Jay Baruchel flies out to LA to see his close friend Seth Rogen, who takes him to a big party at James Franco's house.

","I love the concept of this film, especially the fact that they play themselves, which is for one, completely unexplored, and two absolutely genius. Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, the directors of the film, who have made some superb films already and in my opinion some of the funniest films of this era, but this is no exception.<br/><br/>The unbelievable cast, just sets off to a great movie, with the main cast being Seth Rogen, Jonah Hill, Jay Baruchel, Danny McBride, Craig Robinson and James Franco, all terrifically funny, all playing their parts brilliantly. I'm certain their is no-one funnier than Jonah Hill, creating yet again being part of a comically genius movie. <br/><br/>The movie, which shows an apocalypse in a totally different light, and shown through a comical eye, how famous people would react and how they interpret the situation, is just golden, and really doesn't get much better. It is set in James Franco's house, LA, which is a perfect setting for this movie, with Franco's new found fame, which shows how fame is gone to his head, in a very funny sense. <br/><br/>I heavily recommend this movie to almost everyone, obviously not kids and some more mature people may not find it that funny, but for 95% of the population who have a good sense of humour, definitely go this movie. Absolutely outstanding, full of jokes from start to finish, go see it (now). What are you waiting for."
"joeybecker11","10","3","8","28 June 2013"," Perfection.
","This movie is comedy gold. I have seen it 4 times now since it came out and it's worth the pay every time. I have been excited to see this movie for quite some time now, and when it came to theaters to theaters it exceeded my expectations. The plot is just an amazing idea. A bunch of immature Hollywood movie stars such as Jonah Hill, James Franco, Jay Baruchel, Seth Rogen, Danny McBride, and Craig Robinson are the main stars in the film. I can't say which of them did a better job because all of them brought me to tears from laughter during the movie. The best part of this movie is easily the dialogue. The one-liners and conversations that were put into this film were just absolutely hilarious. The action was even surprisingly good! I'm still stunned by how gut-bursting and excellent this movie was. It is truly a movie I could watch over and over again and not get tired of. A comedy with a very high user ratings? Don't see that too often. The only mildly negative thing I will say, is that it is a very very crude and sexual movie. Language is used every second throughout the movie, especially sexual references, and the violence is very graphic. If you can get past all that, and find the humor in those perverted jokes and such then this is the movie for you. With the cast in this movie it's pretty obvious what you are going to get from it. I know that there's some huge critics of Seth Rogen out there but he (and the rest of the cast) honestly did a hilarious and outstanding job in this movie. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND GO OUT AND SEE THIS MOVIE. A true comedy for the ages. A must see. Easily one of, if not my all time, favorite comedies I have seen."

","From the casting, to the special effects to the on screen chemistry this movie is absolutely brilliant. I do not see any other comedy coming close to being as original as this one. This is not a regular comedy with a few funny scenes, this is one of those rare movies that has you laughing from beginning to end. <br/><br/>The execution of every single scene in this movie is designed to make you wet your pants with laughter. Just when you feel like they possibly couldn't add to it and make it funnier, they do. <br/><br/>Must watch for anyone who feels like they have any sense of humor. Definitely the best comedy of the year if not the the best comedy of our time."

","I can't believe how many people are slating this film. I went to see it with the OH and we spent the whole film laughing out loud. Sure, there are a few head in hand moments where some of the jokes just step over that imaginary line but I found the cast to be so likable that it just didn't feel offensive. <br/><br/>I don't quite understand people's complaint about there being no plot......the film follows a storyline (alright its not exactly straining the brain cells), there are a few twists and turns as well as some unexpected scares towards the end (which just made us laugh harder) and there is a pay off at the end. I mean seriously, how can you walk out of the movies upset when the film finishes to a Backstreet Boys song - it was hilarious!! <br/><br/>The acting felt very natural and I wasn't surprised to find out a lot of it was ad-lib - sooooo looking forward to seeing the gag reel on the DVD - which yes I will probably pre-order. <br/><br/>Pineapple Express has to be one of my favorite comedies and I think that if you enjoy watching Seth, James, Jay and Co on screen then you will simply love watching this film. <br/><br/>I would definitely recommend this film to anyone who wants to take two hours of their life, spend it in the company of friends, laughing their socks of and enjoying a randomly funny, witty and entertaining comedy. Just go and enjoy."
"markbeckford","9","3","8","22 June 2013"," Has Seth Rogen ever been in a bad movie?
","""This is the End"" is a laugh riot. Has Seth Rogen ever been in a bad movie? His lowest rated movie per RottenTomatoes is ""The Watch"" (16%), but I thought that was a pretty funny and entertaining movie. I think ""The Green Hornet"" is the limpest of the bunch. If you are offended by that adjective, you definitely should NOT watch this movie as there are more male body/sex/potty jokes than I've seen in any other movie in my lifetime (and I am old enough to remember Porky's). <br/><br/>At face value, it seems like it would be pretty hard to screw this movie up with Seth Rogen, James Franco, Jonah Hill, Danny McBride, Michael Cera and a dozen others playing themselves during the ""Apocalypse."" Even Rihanna and Harry Potter's Emma-freaking-Watson have extended cameos. There is one cameo that is so absurd and crazy that it would be a major spoiler to reveal it. <br/><br/>Speaking of spoiler alerts, you'd think that the cause of the Apocalypse wouldn't be revealed, but that hasn't been the case with one reviewer mentioning that it as a literal interpretation of the Bible's Book of Revelations. You're at least 45 minutes into the movie before they reveal what is really happening (unless you are, or were, raised Catholic. Then you get it pretty early on). <br/><br/>Yeah, it's also a riff on the egocentricity of Hollywood celebrities, but who really cares unless you are an avid reader of TMZ or Perez Hilton. The real brilliance is in the dialogue, a ton of which has to be ad-lib/improv. There are so many jokes in this movie told in the context of the story it would fill a TV comedy series for multiple seasons. <br/><br/>This is a two-hour comedy movie. Do they make any comedy movie that long? I just hope it has a ""Lord of the Rings"" style Extended Edition on DVD."
"Filmocracy","8","3","8","22 June 2013"," A refreshing end of the world story with laughs.
","""This Is The End"" takes what your previous knowledge of what Seth Rogan and Even Goldberg's can do, and completely sets a new standard. The Film is as stated by Rogan mainly ad libbed, but it's so hard to tell because of how good all of the actors truly are with one another. Having a funny script is one thing, but having actors who can better it takes the movie that much farther, and it does just that. A majority of ""stoner comedy's"" have a linear plot with no progression in story, but this has a different take on it. The movie has some emotional toll to it, half due to the story since we've all been in some of the human relationships with friends while the other half is you don't want your favorite actor/character to die, or something bad happen to them.<br/><br/>With just one scene coming to mind that is a little to far, all of the actors give an amazing performance with references to their previous works, and a twist in the story in the second half which is almost shocking that the movie took that turn it did. Overall it's a very solid movie with laughs along the way."
"mvd102000","8","6","23","13 June 2013"," A Resurgence for Rogan and Pals
","Five years ago, the Hollywood movie scene was in love with Seth Rogan and his band of unconventionally lax co-stars. In the time that's passed, the comedy group has put out more misses than hits. Fans were clamoring for the guys to get back together and work on projects that included the familiar faces that made films like ""Knocked Up"" and ""Superbad"" so hugely successful with movie-goers. And after half a decade, our dreams have come true, as Rogan, Franco, Hill, McBride, Robinson, and Buruchel come together in this dream-team apocalyptic comedy. We're even lucky enough to see the likes of Michael Cera, Jason Segal, Paul Rudd, & Christopher Mintz-Plasse.<br/><br/>But you have to get past the 'wow' factor of all that star power. After all, it sure didn't help films like ""Valentine's Day"" in terms of quality. Actually, more often than not, it can do a lot to hinder the quality, and what you're left with is a miscast, over-budgeted film with less-than-desired character development and screen time that's unevenly distributed for the sake of getting the biggest names involved a good chunk of the spotlight. This film really breaks the mold.<br/><br/>This is the End not only delivers us the very best of this generation's biggest comedians, it also brings something very original and unique to the table. The film stars each actor as themselves, and takes us to the world of fame, fortune, and Hollywood partying. Jay Buruchel, not a fan of the wild, fast-paced Los Angeles lifestyle, visits the city to spend time with Seth Rogan, who's adopted the scene as his own through his success in recent years, along with some famous new friends. Buruchel is reluctant to go to a big Hollywood party at James Franco's house, but goes anyway as a favor to Rogan. <br/><br/>This film portrays the two main characters the way you would expect them to be in real life, which is great because it won't take you long to invest in the characters if you've followed their respective movie careers closely enough. The other actors all have a unique twist, (with the exception of maybe Robinson) which is also good because it shows the men in a new (usually hilarious) light - and provides a bit of suspense in discovering new sides to very familiar shapes.<br/><br/>The acting is great for what the movie is. It isn't phenomenal, and you shouldn't expect it to be based on the silly premise of the movie and the catalog of performances by each of the film's main characters through the years. This film provides some of the best comedy I've seen since the 'golden age' of last decade though, and it's downright hysterical. <br/><br/>Having said all of that it's nothing groundbreaking in the world of comedy. It's definitely something new, and breathes new life into the comedy careers of the main stars of this film. The nostalgia is incredible on top of that, as most fans of these guys have been waiting a long time to see them paired up again in some fashion or another. For many like myself, hope of seeing something as funny as the movies that introduced all of these stars to the world of comedy was beginning to fade, and a lot of us began to wonder if they had lost their touch and played all of their best cards already. This film not only debunks that, but it makes two things vividly clear - Rogan needs to write more of his own movies, and these guys have plenty left in the tank."
"generationfilm","7","6","23","11 June 2013"," This is the End- This Chaotic Apocalyptic Fantasy Triumphs in Vulgar Laughs and Whimsical Twists on Personalities Despite Being a Tad Pretentious
","It doesn't really seem like an odd question when you think about it but  have you ever had a daydream fantasy of imagining what it would be like  to experience the devastation of the apocalypse, either of religious  origin, zombie led, or alien controlled, with all of your closest  friends right beside you? Well it seems co-writers Seth Rogan and Evan  Goldberg who have written everything together from the good (Superbad),  the bad (The Green Hornet), and the ugly (The Watch) have envisioned  such a scenario in their newest comedy This is the End, which also sees  the two screenwriters sharing the directing chair to control their  apocalyptic fantasy as it unfolds in all of its crudity, chaos, and  humorous twists on celebrity personalities. And surprisingly this  rabidly tongue in cheek, incessantly crass, and occasionally uneven  farce, which initially seems like it's the most inside of inside jokes,  ends up being a rather enjoyable and demented excursion into the  hellish depths of two developing comedic minds. Not everything works  throughout This is the End but it's a script that's filled to the brim  with enough clever jokes, whimsical references, and biting social  commentary to outweigh the occasional sense of pretentiousness and  self-congratulatory trumpeting of its smug Hollywood private party. It  seems the writing team of Seth Rogan and Evan Goldberg has found an  inventive delivery to test the limits of their comedic vulgarity while  also giving a swiftly refreshing breath of fresh air to the premise  that gives us a unique combination of critical self-parody and  humorously grotesque comedy. Taking the Apatovian usual suspects and  placing them in the chaos of the apocalypse was clever enough but  adding in rapid fire dialogue, clever twists on known and unknown  personalities, and a comedic energy not seen in many disappointing  comedies of our modern years certainly makes This is the End worth  risking for more than a few laughs. When comedy becomes expected it  ends up losing its necessary impact but that isn't the case for Seth  Rogan and Evan Goldberg's directorial debut as they allow the  uninhibited lunacy of their characters loose throughout their  post-apocalyptic fantasy world that will inevitably surprise you in its  humorous risks and solid comedic delivery."
"EmmaDinkins","8","5","18","16 June 2013"," Chix Chat on Film: Funny as hell
","This is the end of the way I view a film as a comedy. I experienced some of the funniest and some of the most disturbing situations imaginable in this film that played out one possibility in biblical proportion of how the world would end. The fact that everyone used their own names made the story have a realism about it that even further played into the comedy. I don't typically associate special effects with a comedy, but this film had some pretty good effects going on with the hell mouth sized sink holes, the rapture and the devil-dog. I was rather impressed that they weren't SyFy channel fodder, which is typically hard to swallow. The majority of the jokes were potty humor and there were an excessive number of phallus symbols, skeet and penetration innuendo, but the raunchy jokes won laughs even though some came with a bit of a grimace because it is somewhat embarrassing to admit. Who would have imaged the apocalypse as a situation comedy? Obviously Seth Rogen, who is the co-writer and co-director, he played the story straight and even takes a jab at his own acting prowess. There were quite a few talented entertainers in this story and many of them also played into the areas that have characterized their presence in Hollywood. Michael Cera comes across as this out of control drug abusing, womanizing whiner, which is the antithesis of every role that I have ever seen him portray. And the slap that Rihanna placed on him for his inappropriate behavior simply cracked me up. In all honesty, I know that the situation with Danny McBride was making fun of Magic Mike, but Channing Tatum was just done wrong. Good thing that he is obviously secure in his manhood, but he did use his actual name. This film was just plain funny, and one scene that made me laugh out loud, that I don't think others in the theater quite understood was when the elderly lady responded as to why she had placed a sign in her establishment. I could hear that I was the last person to stop laughing at that bit. Who would have thought that you could leave an apocalyptic film, feeling good at the end? Obviously Seth Rogen, the musical ending had me moving in my seat with a smile on my face, which was just the icing on the cake. I give it a green light."
"whistler118","2","3","9","31 October 2013"," NOT Funny, NOT Interesting - It must be an American thing.
","Where to start a critical review on something that IMDb has given a 7/10 for? In a film like this you are looking for two key things, a robust story line, but more importantly, comedy. This film failed to deliver on both.<br/><br/>First, I will comment on the story line. In films like this I do not expect this to be great. The apocalyptic hell that has arisen created a setting of which the meat of the film, being the comedy, could bounce around in. The survival aspect is where the actors attempt to provide a semi-comical and drug focused positive out of a desperate situation. Story line wise, there is nothing new here. If you have watched any horror or zombie films you will quickly release where the story line is taking you. Apart from being mediocre for most of the film the plot line deteriorates very quickly towards the end of the film and boarders on completely ridiculous. <br/><br/>The main issue I have with this film is the comedy. I must draw to the fact that this is a Seth Rogan film. The 'marmite' love him or hate him factor will be the audience's main decider on the quality of the film. As a British audience we generally do not understand why the Americans find Rogan funny. His drug centered comedy and slow and sluggish delivery of unfunny lines is something we can neither relate to or find amusing. The only dim light that appeared through this comedy smog was that of Jay Baruchel who's more interesting and articulate voice brought my attention back to the screen. <br/><br/>Without giving away spoilers it is difficult to describe the truly tedious and boring film that I wasted a few hours of my life on. I will give this film a 2/10 as I think I laughed once during this film. Perhaps ironically, the only way to enjoy this film is with the use of narcotics, as without them you will wish that you had been one of the lucky people that was dragged into the abyss in the first ten minutes of this film."

The only good thing was the special effects of the apocalypse & the power ballad at the end of the film which surprising gave the ending a really cool ending to what was a dull film.

It was...good. With a movie that has essentially no plot to it at all, this movie does a good job at keeping the comedy at a high level, while pushing forward to the next point of action without any lulls or dull moments. Every actor provides their own funny moments throughout the movie and no one is left out. There weren't as many gut busting laughs as I thought there would be, but there were also enough laughs all the way through the movie to keep you engaged and laughing most of the way through. <br/><br/>Overall, I was satisfied with the movie and thought it was definitely the funniest one of the year (so far). Honestly, how could you go wrong with virtually every funny comedic actor and put them on one screen. If you love comedy, I would highly recommend going to see This is the End."

","Ugh... where to begin? So I finally got round to watching this ""dark comedy"" from the prolific (and invariably hilarious) Rogen-Goldberg partnership that had so far managed to evade me. Excited to find a Seth Rogen film featuring so many of my favourite comedy actors, I was praying it would be more Pineapple Express and less Your Highness.<br/><br/>It wasn't. I know lots of people love this film, but then again lots of people voted for Hitler. I'm not saying this movie is as bad as the Third Reich, I'm just saying it's a self-indulgent piece of crap that screams of a stoned Seth Rogen and an ""inspired"" James Franco ""brainstorming"" over a 3am KFC bargain bucket.<br/><br/>The premise is that Franco is throwing a star-studded house party at his Beverly Hills mansion, replete with drink, drugs and general debauchery, when suddenly it's the apocalypse. Amidst the earth giving way, fire & brimstone, & demons that rise from the depths of hell itself, the merry band of soft, pampered starlets do their best to survive with the considerable lack of real-world skills that they possess. Great premise, right? Hence why the execution is so perplexedly disappointing.<br/><br/>Yes, there are inevitably numerous funny moments that mostly arise from the chemistry between these real life friends, who manage to poke fun at themselves as the generally useless human beings that they are. However this is the smallest of redeeming qualities that can't make up for the multiple times when I literally fell asleep. Oh, and did I mention how monstrously awful Emma Watson is? It's quite an achievement to be the biggest over-actor among that cast, but Hermione manages it. Hearing her repeatedly say ""You want to rape me?"" in her totally out-of-place posh accent is not funny or ""edgy"" guys â€“ it's moronic, and just a little bit creepy considering all the men are in their thirties and she still looks like she's 15. <br/><br/>I'm guessing that if you're 16 or under, you'll find the explosions, drugs and demon rape delightful, otherwise, why not hit yourself in the head with a mallet instead? It'll kill fewer brain cells, and waste far less of your time."

","I have no words to describe this film. I mean, seriously? It's awfully pathetic and idiotic, and probably the most ridiculous effort yet that I've seen in that 'Judd Apatow' kind of comedy. What can be said in a review about this film, anyway? I could've been talking detailed how idiotic is the scene where James Franco and Danny McBride are mimicking that they were throwing sperm in each other, and how stupid the idea of playing a Whitney Houston song while Seth Rogen was being saved, was cheesy and ridiculous, but I realized that it would be a pointless exercise, simply because I would be pointing the obvious. The goal of that film is being as absurd and ridiculous as possible, so anything said as critic would be pointless as well. It's hilarious. So let's make it simple. No review at all. I just want to say that sometimes it's forced and really looks lame, but that is the intention. I think the world is starting to accept that kind of stupid comedy and that is what is worrying me. It's hilarious anyway. 5.4/10"
"jimbo-53-186511","6","2","5","13 January 2014"," A bit of a hit and miss film, but it's just about watchable
","I was a little bit apprehensive about watching This Is The End as I'm not particularly a big fan of Seth Rogen. I decided to give this a shot as it has a reasonable IMDb rating and I was in the mood to watch something that would make me laugh. It succeeded in achieving its objective, but I wasn't laughing as often as I would have hoped.<br/><br/>Where I think this film was at its strongest was in all the scenes where the characters are sending themselves up; we have the gag about Seth Rogen playing the same guy in every single film (which both Danny McBride and Jay Baruchel both rib Seth Rogen about). We have the gag involving James Franco and him keeping all his props from all his films (including the hand held camcorder from 127 Hours). There was also the very funny parody of The Exorcist when the gang perform 'The Exorcism of Jonah Hill'. It was in scenes like these that the most enjoyment could be found and I just wish there had been more send ups like these.<br/><br/>In all honesty, I found some of the gags that didn't involve parody or the characters sending themselves up didn't quite work as well - there is one scene where James Franco and Danny McBride are arguing about McBride cumming all over his porn mag and then McBride saying that he had 'cum' in various parts of his house - it just wasn't particularly funny. There were other moments in the film where crude/crass jokes were used (now I've not got a problem with crudeness being used in comedy films, but it has to be funny for it to work - if it's not funny then for me it's just pointless and unnecessary). I'll say one thing though, I was glad that Michael Cera got killed off early as his character was really annoying.<br/><br/>What's most interesting about this film is that there is a strangely good moral - those that are good to others and commit good deeds are taken up to heaven and saved from the apocalypse. I thought that was kind of good (in a weird sort of way). Although in all honesty from what we've seen of Baruchel, Rogen & Robinson, did any of them really deserve to go to heaven? - the only one of those characters that were even close to being likable was Craig Robinson which at least explains why he was saved first. <br/><br/>This film was OK, but it only just falls into a watchable category. There were too many parts where the humour fell flat and the only time it really worked were the parts where the cast were sending each other up and the Exorcist parody was also pretty funny. It really deserves a 5.5 out of 10 (rounded up to 6 for IMDb)."

","...Seth ""Superbad"" Rogen and Evan ""ditto"" Goldberg's relentlessly self- referential apocalyptic comedy has moments of genuine humor that are often neutered with juvenile excess. The opportunities for biting satire are subsumed by rampant dick jokes and similar puerile comedic fluff. The relationships of the characters never ring true no matter how wedded to reality they may supposedly be, the skewering of Michael Cera, figuratively and literally, being a prime example of such notes of falsehood.<br/><br/>It's a shame, really, because the potential was there. I don't quite feel that I wasted my time with this one, but I know that it won't be too long before I've forgotten it completely.

","I decided to see this due to the fact that I enjoyed other films with Seth Rogen in such as 50/50, Superbad and Knocked up but this film was a bit of a let down. If you enjoy films with a high proportion of sexual related jokes, drug abuse, swearing and monster genitals along with an apocalyptic theme then this maybe the film for you. <br/><br/>It had its funny moments but generally not a good script and some really messed up stuff was in it. I'm fine with a little bit of sex, drugs, smoking and drinking etc but this took it too far. AND I liked the Inbeweeteners. There was also too much fantasy stuff like these monsters and light beams taking you to heaven etc. I like fantasy if the script is good e.g. Harry Potter, Pirates of the Caribbean, Jurassic Park etc but the script was so bad in this. I think it had the potential to be good as the actors have done some good things such as Seth Rogen, Michael Cera, Emma Watson (obviously) and Christopher Mintz-Plasse but due to the script and storyline being appalling it's pretty low down on my film list.

The drinking urine part was just utterly disgusting and not in the least bit funny.

This is a new idea to me, but the novelty ends there. The rest of the film features a bunch of best friends acting irresponsibly, in a very juvenile way. The dialog is at times so ridiculous that makes me wonder why the filmmakers thought it was a good idea.

Just do not expect anything groundbreakingly deep. Not literally anyway."
"phubbs","6","2","5","15 September 2013"," This Is the End
","So someone in this group has a hard for The Backstreet Boys, well lets call it a guilty pleasure shall we. Best mates Rogen and Goldberg have written many films together and this time they decided to simply make a film which included all their other best mates...and have a blast (is this really work for these people??).<br/><br/>Enter Franco, Hill, McBride, Robinson and Baruchel (along with Rogen) as they all play themselves (so to speak) in LA for a lively house party. Along for the ride we see cameos from Cera, Segel, Tatum, Ansari, Watson, Mintz-Plasse, Kaling, Rudd, Hart and errr...Rihanna? (someone must have a hard on for her).<br/><br/>So most of the cast from various Rogen/Goldberg flicks are here along with a few of their friends and some of the cast from 'The Office'. During this party at Franco's house there are big earthquakes as the world slowly comes to an end and lots of people end up being killed off. This sequence is one of the better parts of the film as you various stars getting killed and their precious little world of LA getting burnt to a cinder. Dunno what some of these people would do without LA because we all know they can't bare to be away from it for real.<br/><br/>From here on its a survival flick with a small bunch of guys enduring a nightmare scenario during the apocalypse...but with a dark comedy twist. The whole idea is kinda interesting but at first I found myself not liking most of the 'characters'. They are suppose to be playing themselves but of course its hyped up...you do kinda wonder though, how close to the bone these performance are. I'm sure these film stars lives aren't too far off this angle, regular parties/get together's in their big mansions, weed, booze (to a degree), sexy girls on call, spending crazy amounts of money on weird interior decorations that only the mega rich could even dream of affording, does make you roll your eyes.<br/><br/>As the film progresses it does get better and more like a spoof or parody of horror/action flicks, kinda like 'Army of Darkness' maybe. That kind of low budget trashy nonsense where you can just roll with the silliness and have fun. The only difference here is the film isn't low budget, it looks pretty slick in the devastation sequences and has some nice demonic CGI beasties too. Of course there are plenty of B-movie moments which are cool, mainly the deaths which are deliberately over the top and bloody, a few predictable rips from other movies and of course the dialog is totally slapstick. The whole thing actually felt very much like a live action version of the 'South Park' movie from 1999. The big red magma fella in the finale with his huge 'fireman' swinging right in front of the camera!...you see what I mean.<br/><br/>On the one hand I did enjoy these guys talking about their previous flicks, comparing sequences, making homemade sequels when they were bored, sticking in old props and generally taking the mickey out of each other. But on the other hand, after a time the whole thing does seem to feel a bit self-conceited, these guys are laughing at themselves sure...but are they really? it does come across as a bit of a vanity project, call me cynical, but end of the day we all know these folk love talking about themselves and their films.<br/><br/>When the film is getting stuck into the plot and not revolving around the stars film CV it can be a fun flick. There are some great dialog conflicts here and there, the cum dialog sequence between Franco and McBride springs to mind and I quite liked how Hill mentions that the rescue services will come for them first because they are big movie stars (deep down they all probably actually believe that). Not too sure if its just LA that gets destroyed in the story or the whole world though, thought it was LA because of the earthquake prone area but unsure, I'm guessing its the whole world.<br/><br/>Its funny though, certain cast members play the same type of characters you'd expect. McBride is the untrustworthy schmuck like he always is, so hardly playing himself really, Franco is kinda underhanded and is Jonah Hill gay??. Any who the film is reasonably enjoyable at times yet a bit self indulgent I think. This could of been a more straight up dark comedy fantasy without all the self promotion and pointless buddy cameos (they love this in-house stuff no matter how self depreciating, don't kid yourself), it still would have worked well. I think you gotta like this particular bunch of actors basically, I do like Rogen, Cera, Hill and McBride so it was passable for me. If you don't get on with these guys then this probably isn't the film for you.<br/><br/>6/10"

","""This is the End"" is a fantasy pipe dream about what will happen if the end of the world happens in LA just when a party is happening at actor James Franco's house. <br/><br/>This movie gathers James and his real-life gang of friends Seth Rogen, Jonah Hill, Jay Baruchel, Craig Robinson and the most raucous, brashest and biggest a**hole of them all, Danny McBride. There were several cameos from several stars, like Michael Cera, Rihanna, Paul Rudd, Emma Watson, and Channing Tatum in scenes you simply have to see to believe it. <br/><br/>They all look like they had a lot of fun as the script (if there was one) took them for a grand ride from one movie genre to another. There is disaster, horror, action, sci-fi, and, heaven forbid, even religious! Of course, above all, there's the comedy. <br/><br/>Comedy, of course, is in the eye of the beholder. This movie has some of the most insulting, crass, green, off-color, dirty, sacrilegious, drugged, misogynistic, offensive spoken and physical jokes of all time thrown at you mile a minute. If you are the sensitive type, you might even walk out of this rambunctious mayhem even before the half way point. However, if you are of the majority of their young fans, you will be laughing out loud all throughout its running time!<br/><br/>I am finding it very hard to rate this movie. I admit I was laughing at a lot of the outrageously hilarious stupidity being shown on screen. However, I have to admit some of those jokes were really low blows. I just blame it all on Hollywood crudeness. This is a polarizing film you will either really enjoy or totally hate."

"etpzachry","7","2","5","4 July 2013"," Terrible at trying to relate to common people, but funny as heck
","Starting off the movie is incredibly slow. Over the first 20 minutes or so we are subjected to watching a bunch of successful drunk and stoned idiots, and they like to make that very apparent, enjoy the perks of wealth and fame. That's irritating for me. I've worked hard my entire life and don't get to go out and buy a 3D large screen television just so my friend can get high and play video games when he visits (That's an actual scene!). They spend a lot of time talking about how they want to make more movies so they can get drunk/high and hang out and be funny while making cart loads of money. They hang out a party filled with celebrities in a very luxurious house and we find out the owner is an idiot and just a bad person all around. They are supposed to be playing themselves and if that's true then I HATE them as people.<br/><br/>However after that, it quickly ramps up and is actually pretty funny. It sometimes stretches jokes out too far or gets too dumb, but over all the movie is actually really good. Aside from the beginning the only other complaint I have is the end. They try to shoehorn in some of the worst morals ever and then follow up with the worst green-screen running effect I've seen recently and a completely unimaginative ending and jokes about how they like getting high and partying.<br/><br/>If you just cut out the entire beginning scene, it's just Seth Rogen and a friend running to another friends house when the apocalypse starts, which is fine. I don't need any back story on why you guys are friends or exposition that goes out the window once survival is on the line. Cut out the last 8 minutes and it's ending on a perfect note. Remember, just because it's a comedy it doesn't have to end with a joke especially when it takes you 5 minutes to get there. I can't tell if it's padding or just bad writing and editing, but this movie was very close to being amazing if not a bit short.<br/><br/>I won't give it higher marks because it's just so infuriating and I don't think that Seth Rogen could even comprehend why it's not entertaining to see complete failures enjoying so many luxuries and being able to party and get high all the time. I get it. You're rich. Now stop rubbing it in my face."

It's funny and a rather unusual premise - all the characters in the film are the actors playing themselves, in LA, at a party at James Franco's house, when strange goings on start happening: It's the end of the world, Apocalypse style! There are a lot of laughs but suddenly it all goes downhill and the jokes go from amusing and bawdy to highly aggressively sexual and in that context its just not funny. Ever. And in the cinema big laughs went to embarrassed awkward laughs. It was too violent and too crude, but still punctuated with amusing bits. I won't lie, it was entertaining and theologically speaking (yes, I said theologically) I liked the Bible reference and how good triumphed over evil and it highlighted that God wins over the Devil. Haha! Rapture, the beast with seven heads, the Book of Revelation and loving thy neighbour aside, it was just on the right side of irreverent and wasn't offensive to Christian views although close to the bone on just about everything else. It handled the Bible bits rather respectfully - and I can't believe I'm saying that of such a horrendously rude film! Rude, crude, violent, drug use, sexual reference, sexual acts, reference to sexual acts, scenes of a disturbing nature, flashing lights, cannibalism, Channing Tatum in a gimp mask (disturbingly gorgeous still!), demon possession, nudity, bad language... funny - hilariously so in parts - but too much of the above to make it a good film for me."

If you don't like pineapple express or Seth Rogen in general then don't see this movie. Simple as that. Anyway, I thought this movie did pretty good for a funny apocalypse. Maybe over the top on some parts but it was only making fun of certain movies which I thought was brilliant.

I haven't laughed that much during a movie since I saw Airplane! a couple of years ago, which is a decent feat. The problem, though, is that TitE isn't satisfying. It has a happy ending and had me laughing from start to finish, but the story itself isn't very strong, and Rogen+Goldberg stick a few too many dick jokes in.

True to the trailer though it goes in a comedic direction instead of the depressing direction like in ""Seeking a Friend for the End of the World"" which was advertised as a comedy. But this one is basically the opposite of ""Melancholia"". Watching this movie was like watching grown up ""South Park"" characters stuck in on house together during the end of the world. Which is a cool thought, except despite the obnoxious aspect of this movie it just isn't funny. If the obnoxious humor works it's cool but nothing about this movie is clever or witty, it's random but that is about it. Although few times the randomness works. I slightly laughed maybe twice during this whole movie. The jokes in this is crude as it gets but it's just not all that funny. It sets up to be funny and gets the anticipation going during certain scenarios but falls flat. It just constantly relies on dick and toilet jokes(literally) which can work once in a while. But over half this movie relies on those jokes and it really loses it's momentum. Few times I checked the time about half way through cause I lost interest in it all together and just stuck around to see how it ends. Few of the references of the actors previous stuff is amusing. And the actors playing over the top and exaggerated versions of themselves work for the most part but that is about it.

In fact, some scenes go on terribly, uncomfortably long and it is painfully obvious those scenes are unscripted and just not funny.<br/><br/>What amazed me is that a pretty good chunk of change was spent on CG that wasn't necessary -- they could've used that money spent on the demon and hired a couple of script doctors. <br/><br/>I love a good debate about a movie.

","Although the film had a very thin script, it is full of laughs and has outrageous gags that works in the end for a very enjoyable film. I would not recommend this movie to people easily offended though, for me, the offensive is hilarious. Reportedly Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg (the co- directors) had a running joke on set to see how many people would say ""I can't do that"", Seth was the only person to not say so. The movie provided an interesting insight into a Hollywood party that isn't real but makes you wonder how some celebrities are in real life. For example, is Michael Cera really a coke head that slaps women's butts and has a huge penis(per Mindy Kaling's opinion), doubtful but fun to imagine.<br/><br/>At the heart of this film is the bromance between Jay and Seth and to a lesser extent Seth and James. I felt that Jay's character got too bad of a rap for the first 2/3 of the movie. He is described by everyone else as self righteous, to me he just appeared to not enjoy himself but due to this labeling he seems to move into the role later on. Their story is somewhat sad though, watching two old friends drift apart.<br/><br/>Some not so great parts. At 107 minutes, the movie felt as long as it was. For Rogen and Goldberg's first foray into directing it wasn't anything special from a direction aspect. The film benefited mostly from the script written by the two and the performances from the group. That it is for parts I did not like about it. It was that enjoyable.<br/><br/>I would highly recommend seeing this movie.

"sandyonmovies","8","5","20","12 June 2013"," A crude, self-mocking, hilarious attempt at an overused post-apocalyptic story
","Wow. I was expecting this movie to be funny but I never expected it to be as funny as it was. This Is the End is the best comedy to come out this year. It stars James Franco, Craig Robinson, Jonah Hill, Danny McBride, Seth Rogen and Jay Baruchel as themselves. The group finds themselves in a sort of apocalypse while partying at Franco's house.<br/><br/>The best part of the movie is that the actors play ""stupider"" versions of themselves. Most of these actors have reached household name status, so it's fun to see them make fun of themselves for our entertainment. They know exactly what their fans want to see and they do it, whether it makes them look bad or not. The funniest bits are when they are making fun of each other or referencing one of their previous movies.<br/><br/>The choice of music was selected perfectly for each scene (once you see it, you'll understand). The guest appearances of many well known actors like Emma Watson and Michael Cera add to the comedic effect. The role that Cera plays in this movie is probably his funniest yet.<br/><br/>The most surprising part was the storyline, which I was expecting to be the downfall of the movie (as it is for most comedies). The storyline was well-written and went really well with the comedy. There was a good balance of comedy, action, character growth and those emotional scenes. Each of them had to come to terms with what was going on and accept it in their own terms. The plot wasn't mind blowing or amazing by any means, but it worked really well with the movie and the actor's performances made up for the flaws in the plot.<br/><br/>Without the undeniable chemistry between these five friends, the movie would have suffered. This Is the End was ultimately about the relationship between these five guys, so it literally depended on the chemistry between the six actors. They are all clearly great friends and great comedians, which is what made the movie so great. The movie takes place mostly in Franco's house, so there's not much going on and it all relates back to the six friends.<br/><br/>The movie was written and directed by Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen. They are behind some of the best ""weed-smoking"" comedies that have come out like Pineapple Express and Superbad. The story comes from a short that they both did together back in 2007, along with Jay Baruchel, called ""Jay and Seth Versus the Apocalypse."" Apparently they've been wanting to do this movie for a long time but never really thought it would happen. This Is the End is probably going to become their biggest hit, so far.<br/><br/>I highly recommend seeing This Is the End in theaters with a good group of friends. I've already seen the movie twice in the past week and it was still funny the second time. If you love just one of the six mains actors, then you'll probably love this movie.<br/><br/>It's worth watching the entire movie just for the last five minutes.<br/><br/>This Is the End is a great mixture of comedy, action and spoofs. The entertaining, self-mocking performances of the six main actors makes the movie worthwhile and one of the best comedies to come out in a very long time."

","They really stacked this movie with famous comedians and did a great way about controlling their rolls in the movie. This movie had more to it than I was expecting. Was very satisfied with it. Its a lot crazier than any movie I've seen before. In ways of story telling and events that take place. This movie will keep you alert and entertained every min. At times it is very predictable but other times you can be taken off your feet. One of the coolest aspects about this film is the fact that the characters are playing as their real selves (to an extent). If you are looking for a nice comedy to watch, this is the one if you haven't already."

I had been waiting for this movie all year and I am happy to say that I was not disappointed. Danny Mcbride totally outdid himself, he was exceptionally funny. Jonah Hill was also hilarious, in fact everyone was perfect. I really do not understand how some people can give this movie a low rating. at least the critics were impressed. They had great cameos, the most shocking one was Channing Tatum. I really do hope that this movie tops the charts and becomes a cult classic, cause that is what it is; A true classic.

"jmoney-2","8","5","22","15 June 2013"," Doomsday has never been this funny
","The new comedy, ""This Is The End,"" is a brilliant parody that shows us how a small group of privileged, self-absorbed Hollywood celebrities would react if they had to try and survive an apocalyptic nightmare.<br/><br/>The movie's most brilliant conceit is having the actors all play themselves. It centers on a group of friends who've all co-starred together in various Judd Apatow projects. (Oddly enough, Apatow does not get a producer's credit on the movie.) They're gathered at James Franco's house for a party when all hell – literally – breaks loose. Several recognizable stars perish in the first act, and the survivors – Seth Rogen, Franco, Jonah Hill, Craig Robinson, Danny McBride and Jay Baruchel – barricade themselves inside Franco's ultra-modern Hollywood Hills mansion as the Book of Revelations unfolds outside the front door.<br/><br/>These guys aren't used to being even slightly uncomfortable, let alone forced to live without basic necessities like food and water. Seeing these coddled creatures suddenly thrown into survivor mode is fodder for lots of comedy. The bickering over who gets to eat the house's lone Three Musketeers bar is classic. But mostly, the dilemma serves as a jumping off point for lots of wild, raunchy, sometimes surreal laugh-until-you're-gasping-for-air humor. It's a genuinely hilarious film, one helped by the fact he actors aren't afraid to poke fun at themselves and send-up their public personas and previous big-screen performances. After a while, though, even jokes at their own expense get old. Comedies work best 90-minutes at a time. At 107-minutes, the premise does start to wear a little thin.<br/><br/>While the movie is about celebrities, at its core ""This Is The End,"" is a relatable story about friendship. The central relationship is between Rogen and Baruchel as they struggle to keep their (on-screen) bromance strong as they grow apart and their careers go in different directions. Rogen co-wrote and co-directed the movie with his childhood friend, Evan Goldberg and their portrayal of friendship feels honest and real, despite the unreal circumstances in which the characters find themselves. (Watching the movie, I couldn't help but wonder if the pair drew on their own friendship for inspiration and if Baruchel – the least known of the actors – is merely a surrogate for Goldberg.) Your friendships say a lot about who you are, and a person's innate goodness and worthiness becomes a major theme. But it's unlikely you'll walk out of the theater reflecting upon any of that. What will probably stay with you are the dick jokes. And I get the feeling that's just fine with Rogen and the gang."
"aesgaard41","9","2","6","17 August 2015"," Raunchy Comedy Wrapped In A Cool Candy Coating Shell
","First off, take Seth Rogen, Jay Baruchel, James Franco, Craig Robinson, Jonah Hill and Danny McBride, put them in another god-awful CGI-laden disaster flick full of celebrity cameos, such as Emma Watson and Michael Cera, toss in twenty times more than the allowed profanity, sexual references and drug references than should be allowed in any movie out of Hollywood (but then this movie was written by Seth Rogen, whose brain is already wired a little weird) and a mild smattering of religion, and then you get a good idea of what ""This Is The End"" is all about. Now, as bad as that idea sounds, this movie is actually a lot better than you'd think. James Franco has a party at his new fortress-like house for his celebrity friends while Seth and Jay make a food run and experience a paranormal event as most of humanity is beamed up into the afterlife. Returning to the house, they experience earthquakes as people vanish into the earth. There's some light gore and some dark sadistic dialogue and violence, but the movie moves along so smoothly and rapidly that one quickly gets out of it. Seth and the main cast start speculating that it might be the Apocalypse, probably the most religious stuff in any Seth Rogen (or James Franco or Danny McBride) movie ever. After they plan for what might be a long wait, things take a turn for the worst. McBride reverts to character and immediately eats up all their supplies and is exiled from the house. Emma Watson comes by looking for help but is quickly offended and robs them blind. The in-fighting causes Jonah Hill to make a deal with the devil, and he gets possessed. Franco turns out to be hiding food, and the resulting fight between Rogen's Brat Pack ends up in the destruction of the house. This is not just another one of Rogen's drunk buddy comedies or another offensive drug-laden sex fantasy. There is actually some serious character moments and real comedy in this movie as well as some positive messages in this film, and unlike ""Left Behind"" with Nicolas Cage, it's not overtly preachy. Despite the stupid premise, it's done straight and logical, something you don't see in Seth Rogen movies, with some honest and decent performances and it ends with an awesome message. Dealing with demons and sin on every side, Rogen, Franco and Baruchel are the only ones left after Robinson gives his life to save them, if but only to run into McBride in ultimate douche-bag mode ""Road Warrior"" style and a giant Satan stomping all over what's left of Los Angeles, although, if I was writing this movie, I would have brought Emma Watson back fifty-feet tall and completely insane instead in place of the Devil, mostly because that's something I'd want to see."
"sfdphd","5","2","6","5 June 2015"," Better than I expected
","I usually hate stupid comedies and have never even seen most of the films made by the guys in This is the End but I actually enjoyed this film far more than I expected. I didn't get the references to their other films but that didn't matter. There was plenty to appreciate in an obvious goofball way. <br/><br/>I like end of the world films and there are so many of them that it is difficult to be original but there was something so off the wall about this one that I laughed out loud quite a bit. It was so absurd, ridiculous, and taken to extremes but in a way that was sweet at the same time it was gross. It's the way that guys are and the way they are with their best friends when anything goes, particularly if it's the end of the world and you're all scared and all using drugs and all out of control.... <br/><br/>I guess you have to have a certain kind of twisted sense of humor to appreciate this film. It was what they call over the top but I like the fact that they pushed the envelope to the extent they did..."
"prashant-5609","10","2","6","9 April 2015"," Rare cult classic comedy
","Best comedy of that year. ""This is the End"" is a big inside jokeand luckily I felt like I was on the inside the entire time. Easily the funniest film of 2013 thus far, ""End"" refers to the end of days: the apocalypse, judgment day, the Book of Revelation coming into being. When Seth Rogen and Jay Baruchel show up at James Franco's housewarming party, Hell literally begins to break loose. Some bodies get sucked above by blue lights, other fall into fiery sinkholes. By the end of the initial craziness, Craig Robinson, Jonah Hill and Danny McBride have also survived the crazinessthe six leads all play themselves and have a blast lampooning one another's public image. There's Rogen's annoying laugh, Franco's gay rumors, and the hits fly fast and furious throughout the 107 minute running time. It's totally juvenile and sophomoric, and the story is simply a humorous backgroundbut it's just so damn funny. If you're not a fan of these guys, you may want to stay away. But the lead performances mesh well with celebrity cameos (Michael Cera in particular was one of the many bright spots) and it adds up to a completely ridiculous film that may just be the best comedy of the year. Note: this is not my review but the movie is cult comedy must watch at any time"

","I do love it when actors make parodies of themselves.<br/><br/>What I really liked about this movie is that the actors are playing very selfish versions of themselves and the versions that are played up in the media, which just shows the fun side to this guys, and the fact that they are all actually friends in real life which was a big up for me in the film because friendship is a big one for me.<br/><br/>Another positive the film had going for it was the movie references and the celebrity cameos. Celebrity cameos are normally annoying but here they all work because the celebrities are either making fun of themselves or are just completely off base with how they are seen in the media (e.g. Emma Watson or Michael Cera). As someone who watches a lot of movies, I liked the movie references especially the fact that they make fun of some of the bad movies that they have been in.<br/><br/>The only few things that go against the film where probably just the last third where jokes are unnecessarily dark and really pandered to the ""toilet humor."" But that was just a nit pick.<br/><br/>Overall, this is one of the best comedies I've seen in a while and probably one of my favorite comedies of all time."
"BeneCumb","6","2","6","29 June 2014"," Quite a good rubbish :)
","As I am no admirer of the actors having leading roles in this odd creation, I did not expect much, but decided to see this movie due to high acclaim. Well, the result was better than I had feared, as most of the participants performed boldly and with a lot of self-irony. As for the script, it is rather hectic and loose, but it's craziness does not live up to which is used in most British similar movies. I personally find the scenes prior to ""sci-fi stuff"" best and most amusing, the very ending is funny as well. Somewhere in-between, the pace slows down, and there are jokes resembling Jackass, or just attempts how far is possible to go vis-a-vis rudeness and dope...<br/><br/>As for acting, the best parts are performed by Craig Robinson and Michael Cera, the least interesting - by Danny McBride and Jay Baruchel whom I did not remember from any of the movies. Seth Rogen is much better producer and screenwriter than actor.<br/><br/>If you like Canadian comedies, messy fun and blunt jokes, then you will probably enjoy This Is the End as well. For me, it was an average 1 hour 40 minutes in front of screen."
"iaijohn","6","2","6","27 June 2014"," Morality Tale
","It begins as a stoner comedy but ends up a morality tale. Sort of like Cheech and Chong meet Revelations; you know in the Bible. The story is simple, during a party at James Franco's, the actor, there is an apocalyptic event. Yes it spoils the party. Many guests are swallowed up by the earth. Interestingly enough six comedians are left holed up in Franco's house. The comedians become serious. One of them, Jonah Hill, becomes possessed. Yes that is serious. So now you have a scary movie. The rest of the story devolves into a morality play with comedians doing good for their fellow man then becoming teleported up to heaven; a rapture thing. So you get the full Monty from bad boys to angles in just one film. What a bargain!"

","I was amazed to find more than a couple of bad reviews of this movie here, but, so it goes. To each his own, I guess.<br/><br/>For me, ""This Is The End"" had everything I would want in a movie with this all-star comedy cast. It's a pull-no-punches-bar-no-expletives-the-grosser-the-better howler. Seldom do I laugh out loud more than once or twice in a comedy. Usually - and I don't think I'm alone in this opinion - there are those scenes, at most two, that everyone talks about in a comedy that produce the helpless outburst of laughter. If it's a good comedy, the rest of the movie is made up of 'chuckle scenes'. And that's all I expect or can hope for, and it's good enough for me.<br/><br/>""This Is The End"" is made up almost entirely of uproarious, pee-in-your-pants funny stuff, and there were few moments when I WASN'T laughing out loud. I'm not going to go into any plot descriptions or critiques of artistry, etc here. Suffice it to say that this movie succeeded in taking the stuff that writers Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg & Jason Stone were probably cracking each other up with and translating it to the big screen. All of the actors give each other rafts of %#*@&$* throughout the movie, every pompous balloon is loudly exploded and no face is left, um, un-pied, shall we say. The result is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen in my life. And that's WAY MORE than good enough for me."

","I am going to begin my review of ""This is the End"" by stating that this comedy is one tour-de-force zany trip. Does it make it an infinite comedic classic? Probably not, but its still worth the ride. The writer- director team of Seth Rogen & Evan Goldberg do helm this one as an outlandish mock festival with a fair amount of laughs. Numerous comedic actors play themselves including James Franco, Jonah Hill, Danny McBride, Jay Baruchel, Craig Robinson, and Rogen himself. The premise is that they are at a party at Franco's mansion and in less than 127 minutes, an apocalyptic catastrophe wreaks havoc and puts all the actors in a tailspin survival crisis situation. There is plenty of mocking around here, as they all play presumed versions of themselves. There are a plethora of ""over the top"" scenes in the flick, especially with McBride & Hill; but in the end, it's all part of the territory. I really cannot acknowledge any acting performance here because they have all that Memorex (is it real or is it) tone to them.

"Buddy-51","7","2","6","22 December 2013"," A unique take on the apocalypse
","Hollywood has made millions out of dramatizing the pending apocalypse, but what if the apocalypse were to happen in Hollywood itself? Like, for real.<br/><br/>Well, Seth Rogan and Evan Goldberg think they know what it would be like and, in ""This is the End,"" they've gathered some of the industry's hottest young stars - James Franco, Jonah Hill, Jay Baruchel, Danny McBride, Craig Robinson, and Rogan himself, all playing themselves - to illustrate it for us.<br/><br/>The question is: how do these guys - who get paid mega-bucks to essentially play at make-believe all day - do when confronted with a real-life crisis, one designed to test their mettle and their basic humanity, in which courage, heroism, self-sacrifice, quick thinking and dexterity with firearms may be the keys to survival? Turns out, just about as well as the rest of us mere mortals would. And that's the kernel upon which Rogan and Goldberg build their affectionate satire, as the boys hunker down in James Franco's pad in the Hollywood Hills to try and ride out biblical doomsday in all its high-tech/CGI/matte-painted glory.<br/><br/>The filmmakers capture the pampered movie star lifestyle with canny accuracy: the orgiastic partying, the drinking and casual drug use, the conspicuous consumption, rampant self-indulgence and egotism run amok. Is it any wonder, then, that none of these Hollywood types are deemed worthy of being sucked up in the rapture, but are instead left behind to fend for themselves and to think long and hard about why they couldn't go with all those other good people? And are they truly past redemption or is there some way to still make amends for a life poorly lived so that they too can take that light beam shuttle to the sky? In addition to the leads, fellow celebrities Michael Cera, Emma Watson, Mindy Kaling, Paul Rudd, Rihanna, Channiing Tatum and The Backstreet Boys make cameo appearances either before or after the cataclysmic event.<br/><br/>Deftly blurring that fine line between fact and fiction, this super-meta movie features fun, self-deprecating performances and a sly and knowing script laced with amusing parodies of sci-fi/horror and action movie clichés.<br/><br/>Clever and amusing."

I haven't laughed this hard all year watching an adult comedy. Definitely a pleaser if you aren't a prude and can overlook societal issues like religious convictions. The main characters kept the film flowing and you have to hand it to the writers who did an exceptional job (unless of course ad lib was highly encouraged).

Suddenly their supplies run low and are forced to creep outside where some devilish creatures are there to create harms way. This sets up a unexpected scenario but the lines create some funny scenes. I unexpectedly found this to be an upbeat hilarious movie. It is not high brow humor but does come with a punch. So have you been saved? Well take note, the end may be closer than you think."

","I sorta kinda remember hearing about this movie a few moths ago, but didn't think much of it at the time. I was bored this evening and saw it being promoted by Comcast so I figured what the heck, and I rented it. <br/><br/>They sort of slowly unveiled the plot, which was good... If they had sprung the concept of the movie on me in the beginning I possibly would have disliked it... But they eased into it, which let me work my suspension of disbelief into it. <br/><br/>Maybe my expectations were low but I thought it was hilarious. It was obvious a lot of the dialog was ad libbed... but with a few exceptions where I thought the dialog was a little awkward & forced, I cracked up through the whole thing. <br/><br/>I particularly enjoyed how a lot of these actors let themselves get parodied & particularly thought some of the cameos were hilarious. Which possibly made this movie for me. Between Danny McBride, Michael Cera, the big scene for Emma Watson, and Channing Tatum towards the end... I was laughing threw the whole movie."
"ladylike_123","2","2","6","14 September 2013"," Uhh.. what the f**k guys???!!
","I was SOOO expecting great things from this movie. I mean the cast is so awesome that I thought it would definitely be a new favorite of mine. <br/><br/>Instead I was EXTREMELY disappointed with this film, if you could call it a film. <br/><br/>I even stayed up late to see this, because I was so SURE it would be worth it, but I can't say enough what a waste of time I found this movie to be. The worst part is, the plot sounds cool. A bunch of friends trying to survive the apocalypse together? ALL of them being outstanding actors who are playing themselves? Get out of here that sounds hilarious. <br/><br/>But the jokes weren't funny, and it's not just me who thinks so. The chaos scenes were just f**ked up, not funny or interesting or anything. Maybe if you were taking an illegal drug while watching it, it might be enjoyable, but other than that I found myself looking forward to the end of the movie simply so I could stop watching it. I was keeping some hope in the beginning that it might get better, that it took a bit to get into it. But they official lost me during the scene where a random guy gets beheaded and they start kicking his head around like a football....<br/><br/>Shoving a bunch of fake blood and special effects into a movie doesn't make it good... There was so much left to be desired in the script. I think they were trying to steal the idea from the Hangover films, where a bunch of mates go on a journey together where a bunch of crazy stuff happens, but the Hangover films are actually GOOD. <br/><br/>:( :( :(<br/><br/>I'm a big fan of most of the actors/actresses and now I just don't know if I'm going to bother to go see there new films when they come out.. I can't trust that the films will be worth it...<br/><br/>I'm surprised as well that there were no nude women, and few sex scenes in this movie. I was glad about this because I'm a woman, and I thought this was further evidence that they intended this movie to survive on it's own without the need for a lot of sexual content, but the numerous penis references and images of penises were just plain stupid and vaguely disturbing... not funny...<br/><br/>Putting the plot aside for one second, what the hell did they do to Michael Cera?? He seemed like such a nice guy in previous films, but I will never look at him the same after this movie, they TOTALLY changed his persona, and I found it disappointing and off putting.<br/><br/>To summarize, this movie gave me the same reaction as when I see the newest article about Lindsay Lohan f**king up again, or Miley Cyrus acting like a total skank, all for a bit more money, regardless of the impact that has on the generations of girls that looked up to her..<br/><br/>I feel let down by this film in every way... I wish I had never bothered to watch it... Shame on you Seth Rogen for wasting money and talent with this rubbish.... you are better than this..."

","This is a Hollywood buddy flick (the actors playing themselves) set during the apocalypse.<br/><br/>When was the last time you went to a movie and laughed heartily and unselfconsciously during the entire movie? That is what I did when I saw this film. It might have helped that when I went in knew absolutely zilch about it. This movie was a pleasant surprise.<br/><br/>Words to describe this film: funny, unpredictable, light-hearted, irreverent, extremely profane, gross (at times), over the top, a little gay, clever, and strangely uplifting.<br/><br/>By the way, I'm not in the right demographic at all: the many drug and masturbation references sort of put me off. It didn't matter. I still laughed. I have to see it again to catch the many cameos I missed the first time around. Canadian humour at its best and raunchiest."
"coreycarruthers","9","2","6","16 July 2013"," A raunchy and vile film that keeps you laughing as much as it does jumping out of your seat.
","I have not laughed this hard in the theater is a very long time. Bringing a few comedians together is funny, but bringing some of the funniest people in Hollywood together and making fun of themselves is genius. Seth Rogan's writing shines it's brightest in a long time with this film's constant rhythm of self mocking followed by absurd gore and destruction. The first 20 minutes of the film truly solidify what this film is all about; the ridiculous bubble in which celebrities live. From Kevin Hart laughing at Jason Segal mocking himself on the sitcom, ""How I Met Your Mother,"" to Michael Cera snorting as much cocaine as Tony Montana, this movie reverses character predispositions in the perfect direction with a plethora of cameos.<br/><br/>This movie's self aware references drive the comedy level to new limits while also keeping the plot of the movie moving along. Near perfect comedy."
"tomassparups","7","2","6","16 July 2013"," The end is nigh!
","Seth Rogen's directorial debut ""This Is The End"" is the newest hit comedy to tear up the ""Box Office"". Surprisingly, it has not only gained the acclaim of cinema audiences, but of film critics as well, earning a stable 83% on ""Rotten Tomatoes"". James Franco, Jonah Hill, Danny McBride, Jay Baruchel, Craig Robinson and Seth Rogen among many other well known celebrities play themselves. Or rather over the top versions of themselves. It follows a fairly simple plot, Jay Baruchel arrives at Los Angeles to spend some time with his old, somewhat estranged friend Seth Rogen. They immediately head to Seth's house where they smoke weed and binge eat. Later on Seth tells Jay that he is invited to James Franco's housewarming party and that he would like Jay to accompany him. Despite being wary of going, Jay finally accepts Seth's offer and they head out for the night. Upon arriving at Franco's house they are greeted by James himself. In the film Franco is portrayed as an art loving pseudo-intellectual in contrast to Rogen who is presented as a stereotypical pothead, the kind he plays so often. We soon see Jonah Hill and Craig Robinson. Hill is portrayed as ultra nice and Robinson as a sex obsessed smooth talker. Among the party guests there are stars like Michael Cera, Emma Watson and even Rihanna, who luckily is killed off soon enough. Jay and Seth decide to go to a local kiosk to get cigarettes. Just as they approach the shop's counter blue lights shoot through the roof and lift several store customers up to the sky. They both panic and attempt to flee back to the party. The streets are filled with chaos, from explosions to vehicle crashes. They manage to get back to the party, but a massive earthquake will soon shatter their relief and begin none other than the apocalypse.<br/><br/>This is quite frankly a genuinely funny film. Yes, it does sometimes buy into cheap slapstick gags, but it is entertaining at all times and even has some golden moments. Jonah Hill's performance was by far my favorite part of this film. He has proved that he can be great in dramatic and comedic roles, or even a both at the same time. He proved this with 2011′s baseball drama ""Moneyball"", even with his early films like ""Superbad"" and I have no doubt that he'll prove it again with Martin Scorsese's upcoming crime drama ""The Wolf of Wall Street"". I love the fact that these actors aren't afraid to poke fun at themselves and doing so provide some great, subtle humor. One of my favorite moments in the film is a certain reference, to a certain film where someone is impregnated by the devil (Rosemary's Baby). The reference was extremely obvious, but to me it was incredibly funny mostly because ""Rosemary's Baby"" is one of my favorite films.<br/><br/>It feels a bit childish at times, but ultimately ""This Is The End"" is a fresh, new comedy that will most certainly make you laugh at least once. It has a fair share of loud , blaring humor, but it also has some moments of subtlety that if noticed will definitely enrich the comedic experience. I immensely enjoyed it and would love to see it again in some time."
"Kenno_789","9","2","6","14 July 2013"," Rogen and Goldberg = Gold
","With a star comedic cast including Seth Rogen, Jay Baruchel, James Franco, Craig Robinson, Jonah Hill, Danny McBride and many more this movie certainly delivers from start to finish. The group are so fluently comedic, I could almost go as far to say it is funnier then Stepbrothers. The plot so effortlessly and seamlessly drives constant laughter throughout the movie. The movie begins with a scene where you begin to see Jay and Seth's characters develop and the plot of jay's awkwardness and dislike of rogens new friends begins and there is a very ""seinfeld""-esque conversation about seths new gluten-free diet. Then they go to a party at James Franco's house which has so many cameos its hard to keep track of them but none more memorable then Micheal Cera's character who rogen describes as being far from his actual personality this entire scene is just wildly hilarious and not before long they are all stranded in franco's house as the apocalypse unfolds as a building ground for which all the stars thrive off, this movie is amazingly hilarious and definitely worth seeing!"
"theodorewarner","8","2","6","14 July 2013"," Thoughtful and funny.
","Of course, the movie is funny. But, the humor derives almost entirely from the celebrity personalities of the actors involved. One has to have watched interviews with Michael Cera to understand the joke of him as a half-witted, horny coke fiend. One has to have followed James Franco's adventures in art house films, art, and literature to get the joke in his exaggerated in-the-moment koans. So, one has to walk in as a fan. And if one does, there is a pretty big pay off here. The guys (because we're all friends here) talk like guys, which is to say: crass, vulgar, and immature. But, at the same time, they struggle to encounter something more meaningful and in their man-child ways, discuss religion, morality, and the nature of celebrity. These are actual topics that the movie seems intent to comment upon. This is a universe in which celebrity for celebrity's sake is damned literally and genuine kindness and friendship is the key to salvation. I suppose that we mustn't forget that comedy is most successful when it is an aspect of inquiry into the human experience in ways that the movie-going public probably forgets. Those comedies that offer us silliness and nothing more are easily forgotten."
"Troy_Campbell","7","2","6","14 July 2013"," Silly... and hilarious.
","A who's who of Gen Y comedy turn out for this offensive, dirty-minded flick that revels in toilet humour, sex jokes and showing off a building-tall demon with massive genitalia. It's completely silly... and completely hilarious. The major drawcard is that everyone is playing (jerk) versions of themselves, which means there are Hollywood references galore and a wonderfully blurred line of what parts of their on screen personalities are real and what parts are fake. Nothing is off limits here; Jonah Hill gets teased for his Oscar nomination, Seth Rogen cops abuse about being a sell out and James Franco's often speculated-on sexual preferences are made even more ambiguous. And that's only the tip of the iceberg. Rogen and regular collaborator Evan Goldberg throw everything including the kitchen sink into the script and they achieve an impressively high hit rate with their gags, only the over-the-top final 20 minutes running dry on laughs. Being the current 'it' group in comedy has its perks too, the cameos come thick and fast in the opening act with Michael Cera stealing the spotlight and Emma Watson further expanding her post-Potter career. This raucous movie is not for all tastes, but inbuilt fans will have a blast."
"kingwreck","9","2","6","13 July 2013"," This is the movie
","Most comedies that have this amount of hype and talent rarely come through. So what the main story consist's of is James Franco has a party and invites a bunch of celebrity friends over or so called to come over for a party. What happens is The End of The World occurs and the interactions of how these celebrity's see themselves is the real joy. McBride and Franco's hate for each other is good fun; Mcbride overall steals the movie. Jonah Hill is the only one who doesn't get much laughs despite his effort,he is better off being a sidekick than a random character being out shined.<br/><br/>Chaos ensues, actors egos get inflated and bloated. A lot good laughs at their outlook on each other whether true or somewhat true, a good comedy to go in or movie and shut the mind off. <br/><br/>For a good time in year of bad blockbusters this is the movie."

","I had been looking forward to this movie as soon as I heard it was being made, as I'm a huge fan of the majority of the actors in this movie. I got pretty much what I expected and also more.<br/><br/>The story is pretty simple, Seth Rogen & Jay Baruchel head out to a party at James Franco's house, filled with plenty celebrities, when the apocalypse comes upon them. the movie pretty much follows how the survivors deal with this bleak situation. To be honest, I do feel the story was probably not the first thing they thought of, its more a case of lets get together with our friends & take the mickey out of each other & play up to our perceived selves, which works out very well!<br/><br/>The effects for this movie were much better than I had expected, as well as much gorier, but it was more for comedic effect than ultra realistic horror territory. Add to the mix so far of a fantastic cast, good effects & an OK story a great soundtrack, although quite mainstream, it was very fitting from the likes of ""The Next Episode"", MIA's ""Paper Planes"" to ""Gangnam Style"". again, nothing felt out of place, or put in for the sake of it.<br/><br/>You can tell that this movie was fun to make for all of the guys involved, so many laughs & absolutely ripping it out of each other, from the geeky James Franco to Michael Sera's over the top loudmouth & obnoxious character, as well as topping it off with Danny McBride being the bad ass you would expect! I cant wait for a home release to see the out-takes, you can imagine there would be plenty!<br/><br/>You put all that together & you have a hilarious movie, which is a little gory & maybe doesn't have the best story in the world, but your there to see the guys all make you laugh. If you love the likes of ""Superbad"", ""Pineapple Express"" & ""Eastbound & Down"", this is the movie you have been waiting for!"

","I saw this movie last night with two buddies of mine and before it started I thought this movie would be funny in the beginning, then drag on and lose it's steam as time went by. I was glad I was wrong. The film was extremely funny, well written, and performed.<br/><br/>This isn't an exact spoiler, but: Michael Cera (I'm not a fan of his at all) is one of the funniest characters in the film. He definitely earned majority of the laughs in the beginning of the movie.<br/><br/>Although ""This Is The End"" is your typical 'buddy-buddy' movie, it delivers a meaningful message for everyone in the audience. I enjoyed the immature humor, inappropriate behavior, and crudeness from each character. It also helped to see it with an audience who shared the same sense of humor that the movie delivered. My advice for future audience members: Pre-game with a few beers and see this movie with your friends. You won't regret it."

","easy 9 out of 10 to be honest. i know that seems too easy and i do not rate films high often but it had me in tears more than possibly any comedy I've seen full stop. Im a fan of Seth Rogan, James Franco and Jonah Hill so I went with an open mind. You go watch this film and just think in the back of your head that they are not funny people then you will just convince yourself that it ain't funny. But the fact is its brilliant, different and funny!!! go see it and judge for yourself but it truly is a brilliant effort at something completely different and it really did work! want to watch it a second time it was that good! Yes it is offensive at times, yes it is silly at times but so what...that's what comedy is about sometimes and guess what...that's real life so all the people slating it for that reason should stop seeing comedy films because every comedy these days is exactly the same in the way of the type of comedy it is aimed at. It doesn't go too far with anything, and it is dark in some places so prepare for a bit of everything (my girlfriend had to look away in some points) but thats why it works so well because it is so different. I love the way they all play themselves as it really does give you an idea of what life is possibly like when you live there with that lifestyle. OK I'm not saying that it is a documentary and is definitely like that but you never know. The Micheal Cera role was brilliant and all the rest of the cast are brilliant in it, even Paul Rudd who turned up for about half a second!"
"TheConnoisseurReviews","8","2","6","2 July 2013"," ""This is the End"" Review
","""This is the End"" is a highly original meta-comedy that puts well known actors into an apocalyptic world. It's self-referential and the actors essentially play an exaggerated version of themselves. The film is filled with strong creative writing with a lot of laughs. The themes are about being a good person and sacrificing yourself for something greater. The punches keep rolling, only slowing down in a few spots. Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg's direction is pretty good. They handle spectacle and slow moments very well. I really enjoy how this film manages to throw curve balls once in a while and have the audience on their toes as the movie gets bigger.<br/><br/>The actors play an exaggerated version of themselves. Jay Baruchel is the main character and fights for his friendship with Seth Rogen over James Franco and has a rivalry between Jonah Hill, who is the funniest amongst the whole crew. The cast has great chemistry together as they play off each other very well and you can get a pretty good vibe that these guys are actually friends in real life. They're all jerks and have to deal with judgment day as they attempt to survive and become better human beings. There are some great cameos from other actors in the film. The best would have to be Emma Watson as she plays a version of herself that we aren't really used to. The only person that I didn't like is Danny McBride. He's annoying and aside from his introduction isn't all too funny. The cast as a whole is pretty strong and work well together to bring us the laughs.<br/><br/>Overall ""This is the End"" is an excellent and highly original comedy. It's extremely funny and smart filled with slapstick, situational, and self-referential humor. The laughs keep coming and only slows down a few times in the beginning and some parts in the middle. The special effects are handled well and the soundtrack supports the film very well. The actors have a fun time playing tabloid versions of themselves and play off each other very effectively. Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg's script is top-notch and they greatly handle the ever growing scale of the film. I give it 4/5, original and great premise accompanied by a committed cast and laugh out loud humor."
"matty_davies17","9","2","6","2 July 2013"," If you like ridiculous, yet stylish apocalyptic comedy, it's for you!
","I went to see this film last weekend and I had been really excited to see it for a while beforehand. I had read some reviews, and seen the trailers and my first thought was that I would love it, and I was right! But here's why:<br/><br/>The first most notable thing is the cast. Seth, Franco, Craig, Jay, Jonah and Danny work together fantastically as a strangely plausible group of 'friends'. As they are playing versions of themselves, a lot of the humour is drawn from that itself, there is even a part where Seth and James attempt a mock sequel to Pineapple Express. Not just this, but there are plenty of other celebrity appearances, from the likes of Rihanna, Emma Watson, Kevin Hart and Michael Cera to name a few. These too are acting as exaggerated versions of themselves, that is if you class what Rihanna is doing as 'acting'...<br/><br/>The next thing is, how ridiculous does the humour actually get? I say this because even I was worried it would become more of a 'spoof' film, such as Scary Movie, although not as bad. Well, to be quite honest, it does get fairly ridiculous, from the ""Exorcism of Jonah Hill"", to Danny McBride becoming the leader of a gang of cannibals and Seth Rogen tearing off the genitals of Satan himself as he gets beamed to Heaven, I'll let you decide what is funny and what is not. Personally, I loved every second of it. Although some of the CGI wasn't up to scratch at times, it is still far more entertaining than the likes of Disaster Movie for example, by an immeasurable amount and somehow, I think they pull it off. As far as offensiveness goes, I think you'd have to be completely pathetic to get offended by anything in this film, although it does go out of it's way to add things in that people may (and are likely) to find offensive. But it's all in brilliantly good humour. <br/><br/>Overall, I highly recommend this film and I might even go see it at the cinema again. On a final note, besides all the hilarity and zany antics, it actually does get you thinking about religion and what it takes to get into heaven (assuming it exists). It might sound strange, but give it a watch and you'll see what I mean. You won't regret it."
"asiegel-8","9","2","6","30 June 2013"," So bad it's. good
","Adjust your expectations accordingly here, this is meant to be more of a comedy than anything else. If you like Superbad, Knocked Up, and movies of that ilk you will enjoy this, it is not an action. It is a comedy horror movie, should have been advertised that way. <br/><br/>In summary Seth Rogen and his buddies are at a party hosted by James Franco when the apocalypse happens and all mayhem breaks loose. The guys go back and forth on how to survive and how to be saved. It got dull with no real direction on how it would end until much later in the film, the first half is funnier than the second half. <br/><br/>Some people walked out of the packed theatre, it did get slow at times, and it was ridiculous. This is a vulgar, mild gore, some disturbing images, and very funny movie. Adjust your expectations accordingly to enjoy."

"NozinAroun81","9","2","6","29 June 2013"," WICKED FUN! (Written By A Die Hard Apatown Fan From Down Under)
","I'm a huge fan of everyone who appears in this flick and I thoroughly enjoy almost every Apatown-related production. My favourites include; ANCHORMAN, 40 YEAR-OLD VIRGIN, KNOCKED UP, SUPERBAD, PINEAPPLE EXPRESS, FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL, GET HIM TO THE Greek and THIS IS 40. I'm a former Video Shop Manager who currently works as a Cinema Manager and who dreams of becoming a Comedian/Comedy Writer... so basically I'm a walking clichÃ©. THIS IS THE END is yet-to-be-released in Australia but I was lucky enough to be treated to a private screening and I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it... except for the last 60 corny seconds worth. I won't say precisely what I'm referring to because I don't want to spoil it. I'm sure you'll understand what I mean when the time comes. Apart from that, I must admit that I laughed heartily at least every few minutes, I jumped a few times, the gore is quite full-on and the effects are really quite good, particularly the De... errr... once again I don't want to spoil it, so I'll just say ""Baddies"". All I knew about the film beforehand was that the stars are ""playing themselves"", the world is coming to an end in some way and they're all trapped in James Franco's mansion. I'm glad I didn't watch a ludicrously long trailer or read a ridiculously long review prior to watching the film. You might want to consider that before reading any further :p <br/><br/>In my opinion, Oscar-nominated thespian Jonah ""MONEYBALL"" Hill and his SUPERBAD co-star Michael ""George Michael"" Cera are the real scene- stealers. Hill is the best ""main character"" and Cera is the best ""cameo"". I also have a ""thing"" for Emma ""Hermoine Granger"" Watson and I thoroughly enjoyed her little stint. Extra kudos also goes to Danny ""EASTBOUND & DOWN"" McBride for being the character you'll love to hate.<br/><br/>In closing, THIS IS THE END is an utterly unique treat and I'd highly recommend it to anyone who considers themselves to be a huge fan of any of the guys on the cover (or a mild fan of at least 2 of them) and/or anyone who enjoys the majority of the Apatown-related productions that I mentioned earlier.<br/><br/>If you like my review, you MIGHT also LIKE my Facebook Page;<br/><br/>""IN THE BUFF (Movie News, Previews, Reviews & Rumours)""<br/><br/>Btw... GET HIM TO THE ""Greek""... is excruciatingly frustrating! Every IMDb review I've ever done has had some sort of annoying glitch like that and there's nothing I can do about it! I tried re-typing it, holding down shift instead of using caps lock, putting it elsewhere in the list, writing it at the bottom of the page and cutting/pasting it. NOTHING WORKS!!!

"curtis-8","5","2","6","24 June 2013"," Good Concept, Some Good Jokes, But Not Really a Movie.
","This is the End plays less like a real movie and more like the longest video ever featured on Funny or Die. Imagine if Bill Murray and Dan Ackroyd had played themselves in Ghostbusters, add in a TON of dick jokes, toss in the inspired Danny McBride, remove virtually all plot, reduce the maturity and intellectual levels of the all-male thirty-something cast to that of 15 year old virgins--and you've got this movie. <br/><br/>There are a lot of good ideas here, but this is strictly first draft stuff. Rogan and company should have worked with a REAL screenwriter who could give the movie a real story and help to flesh the characters out a bit (I mean, are we really to believe that not ONE of these successful GROWN UP male comic actors has a wife or girlfriend? That THEIR ONLY relationships are with each other, like they are all 15?). This is the rare occasion when at least SOME studio intervention would have helped, as Rogan is apparently too inexperienced a story teller to know what to keep and what to toss.<br/><br/>The middle sags especially, with one disconnected, overlong improvisation after another doing little more than filling time. Only Danny McBride really excels at this type of thing, and he's kind of the ""Richard Pryor in Silver Streak"" element in this--not really the star, but easily the most memorable player). <br/><br/>The offhand comments by Rogan and Craig Robinson are funny, but are better used to complement actual dialog, not replace it. And the over-reliance on this kind of dick-joke mumblecore is what almost kills the movie. <br/><br/>But if you're a huge fan of even half of these guys, the movie is worth it. I watched many a bad flick back in the old days just because it starred John Belushi, Chevy Chase, Cheech and Chong or one of the Monty Python gang. But this should have really gone the direct-to-video fans only route."

For those of you who saw the movie and were upset by the content and the humor and the jokes they made, I really don't know why you're surprised. One look at the trailer (red band or not) and you would have immediately gotten what it was about and what kind of movie it would be. I mean, Seth Rogen was a director, was he not? And what kinds of movies does he tend do?

","""This Is The End"" is indicative of how ubiquitous Christian eschatology has become in modern times: The film was written, directed and co-produced by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg in their directorial debuts. The thing is, both Rogen and Goldberg are Jews; and Jewish doctrine specifically rejects the entire New Testament, including the Book of Revelations. The film is a feature-length adaptation of the short ""Jay and Seth versus the Apocalypse"" (2007), Jay being Jay Baruchel; and even Baruchel, who is Christian, nevertheless has a Sephardic Jewish grandfather. Not to mention yet another Jew in the cast, Jonah Hill.<br/><br/>This is very much a guy movie, starring (more of less) Baruchel and co-starring James Franco, Rogen, Hill, Danny McBride, and Craig Robinson, with brief appearances by various other well-known male actors, and two women, Rihanna, who is present almost as an afterthought, and Emma Watson, who comes and goes with dismaying rapidity. She wields a fire-axe very effectively and treats us to four-letter words that Hermione Granger never said.<br/><br/>The film centers on fictionalized versions of its cast members in the wake of a global biblical apocalypse. Jay Baruchel flies into LAX from Toronto and is met by his old pal Seth Rogen. They spend the afternoon at Seth's house, in as dissolute a manner as is possible for two straight guys who never leave the living room. In the evening, Seth takes Jay to a party at James Franco's house. It's the sort of raucous uncivilized bedlam you associate with fraternities like Delta House; and in fact, there is more than a little of an ""Animal House"" vibe to the proceedings. Without warning, the Apocalypse supervenes. Los Angeles goes down in flames, enormous sinkholes leading to Hell appear on people's front lawns, and lots of people magically ascend to heaven on beams of blue light. So what do you think these guys do? Why, it's the opportunity of a lifetime (literally) to let out their inner children - all of whom seem to be petulant 8-year-olds intent on spending Judgment Day behaving like booze-soaked, weed-choked, self-involved, callous, every-man-for-himself cavemen, only now freed of all inhibitions. When the alcohol and drugs run out, food and water get low, the fires get closer, and hellhounds lurk outside the house, these dimwits try to pull together and defend themselves, but they're no better at that than they are at acting their age.<br/><br/>This film is meant to be a satire, or maybe just lead-pipe funny, and it is; and the second half of the film, when the guys are trapped in Franco's house, is supposed to be overdone; but by about the 80-minute mark of the movie's 107-minute running time, their antics were wearing pretty thin. At 90 minutes, I had to force myself to keep watching, because I figured there'd be a wow finish, and there is. The film would benefit from cutting at least 10 minutes from its current length. But that's just me. If you're a member of the target demographic - which I'm guessing is 12-15-year-old boys - you'll probably enjoy the whole thing."

","With an absurd, but entertaining premise, and a fun and insane attitude- This is the End makes the most out of its own potential, by providing for an imperfectly, butr devlishly good time. The film stars and is co-directed by Seth Rogen, and has a large cast of celebrities throughout, all of which play themselves. The cast doesn't give any Oscar-worthy performances here folks, but they do provide for some entertaining additions to the film, and everyone truly gives it there all to provide the film with the sense of laughter it needs. There are moments throughout that make the film seem like it is trying a bit too hard, and there are a few weaker aspects that bring the film down. The pacing can take a bit of a dip towards the middle, but luckily by the end it is able to bring itself back together. I think the film would have been better about 10 minutes shorter, and also think it would have improved a lot more if they took the time and money on fixing the CGI instead of the large cast of cameos at the beginning. This is the End can be quite clever at times, with some truly hilarious gags, and some quite insane moments that are endlessly entertaining. In the end, This is the End is not a perfect comedy gem, but it is very enjoyable and at times very funny. Though it has its uneven nature at times, and a few minor flaws throughout, it is still able to pull itself together and manage to be a fun time- which is always a plus for me.
My Rating: 8.75/10"

","Pretty fun - and how could it not be with such an amazing cast!? The only problem is I had such high expectations and it just didn't quite meet them.<br/><br/>It's a pretty simple premise: a group of friends (who just happen to be the new Hollywood comedy masterminds that can be found in Superbad, Pineapple Express, Knocked Up, Tropic Thunder, Fanboys, Zack & Miri Make A Porno, etc.) go to a party when the Rapture/Apocalypse/End of Days arrives and they have to use their survival skills to overcome the fact that they're all playing exaggerated versions of themselves, so they're constantly having dumb arguments! Heaps of cameos at the start - Aziz Ansari, Kevin Hart, Michael Cera, Emily Watson, Jason Segel, Paul Rudd, Rihanna - so it's fun to play 'spot the comedian/celebrity'.<br/><br/>Plenty of laugh-out-loud moments throughout, but lots of stupidity at times, as they try to take it too far. It ends up going too long - 1 hour 50 min - and overstays its welcome a little bit.<br/><br/>I found it ironic that Jay is essentially the main star, even though he's the least well known of the actors! I did enjoy all the little nods to Freaks & Geeks and Franco-Rogen's relationship... The special effects are good, but it's not actually as horrific/gruesome as it could be - 'Shaun of the Dead' did it much better. Oh, and the ending was pretty annoying too..."
"badoli","8","1","2","10 December 2017"," A bunch of Hollywood actors against the end of the world.
","That's pretty much it. Some party boys face Armageddon and fail to deal with it. It's a ludicrous premise, but offers a lot of comical potential.<br/><br/>The movie satires all the classic stereotypes of horror and zombie movies: Fight for resources, splitting into groups, outsiders versus insiders, arguments over leadership, trust issues and so on. But Franco and friends persiflage themselves (or better their public image) and act as total morons throughout. You're not here to like these characters as ""good people"" and they know it. You're here to watch them stumble through in hilarious fashion and for that the boys present a surprising amount of self irony.<br/><br/>As such the movie is rude, explicit and gory. It's humor that gets better with beer. It's stupid, anarchic, yelling and at times whiny and i love it.

"Screen_Blitz","9","1","2","21 August 2017"," This energetic all-star doomsday comedy is as funny, energetic, and charming as it sets out to be
","What kind of fun and laughter should be expected from a movie starring an ensemble group of A-list actors taking on the end of the world? A lot, actually. That is the purpose writer and directors Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg bring to the table of this energetic hard-R comedic cornucopia that places a team of comedic veterans in the battle for survival against the biblical apocalypse. That's right, the main elephant in the room is the apocalypse described in the Book of Revelations. But with a sharp delivery of raunchy R- rated humor and dialogue dropped into the mix, this is not one Christians should go into expecting something in the vain of 'Left Behind'. It is an unflinchingly raunchy take on the biblical disaster, spliced with wild bursts of laughter and clever pop culture references, of all which are delivered by actors who all playing not original characters but fictional versions of their real-life personas. So here it how everything goes down. Seth Rogen invites his friend Jay Barachul to a party at James Franco's house where Rogen introduces him to Jonah Hill, Craig Robinson, and an enormous crowd of other actors who make minor cameos including Michael Cera, David Krumholtz, Rihanna, Jason Segal, Emma Watson, and many others -- most of whom do not make it to the end. While Rogen is having a good time, the wild partying doesn't quite bode well with Barachul. Things only get worse when the city of Los Angeles is suddenly devastated by series of catastrophic events during what Barachul believes is Judgement Day as described the bible. When the enormous disasters claims the lives of the vast majority of the party, the only survivors are Rogen, Barachul, Hill, Robinson, Franco, and later Danny McBride who crashes the party. As everyone is barricaded inside Franco's house, the six friends struggle to survive against the disaster that places their friendships to the test -- with reasonably hilarious results. <br/><br/>There are plenty of surprises to expect from a comedy-doomsday hybrid revolving around actors playing satirical versions of themselves. Aside from shredding the bushes with familiar disaster elements, the A- list cast has plenty of offer in the midst of the scorching R-rated raunchiness. Blurring the lines between reality and fiction, Each of the cast members splashes us with a solid delivery with meta-humor and clever pop cultures with the purpose of poking fun at each other's real-life careers. For instance, Seth Rogen and James Franco pin themselves in a key plot point regarding a sequel to 'Pineapple Express', a comedy starring the two. And the cast makes great fun of it in one scene involving a cheeky reenactment of the fan-based trailer uploaded online as an April Fools' joke. Furthermore, it is no surprise that these six actors, all of whom had collaborated in the past, share an irresistible chemistry with each other. The foul-mouthed banter, consisting of gut-busting raunchy one-liners, is the driving force of the story and almost never fails to hit at the funny bone. And let's not forget a scene focusing on Emma Watson, or an early scene portraying the goofy, immature persona of Michael Cera. Is it consistently funny? Not quite, especially when it dives into a preposterous subplot involving Jonah Hill toward the end. But their gift for tapping into the laugh box with their hilarity and heartful themes of friendship are endearing and make up for the occasional blemishes in the script. Of course, the irreverent treatment of the biblical apocalypse will, with no surprise; leave filmgoers bound in their Christian faith, with a cold shoulder. That is if they even bother to withstand the lewd nature of the film. Four-letter words, vulgar sex jokes, there is more than enough to overwhelm those who are converted to the Seth Rogen comedic fare. <br/><br/>This Is The End is a wildly entertaining comedy soaring with sharp comedic energy from a cast of infectiously charming comedic veterans. It is a fun comedic fare that stands high on the ladder of its genre. Anyone hungry for an order of raunchy laughs with a side of a little heart and smarts is gifted with a chance of experiencing what maybe one of the funniest comedies in recent years. Not a game- changer, but an entry that warrants a solid ""thumps up""."

Definitely some good action and a surprise cameo or two! My only complaint may be the special effects. Absolutely a good movie if your in the mood to laugh and/or feel good."
"rodjohaness","7","1","2","25 July 2016"," Trigger warning the movie
","Jay Baruchel and Seth Rogen attend a celebrity filled party at James Franco's house and while Jay takes some time out to debate if whether or not he fits in within the superficial and excesses-filled Hollywood lifestyle, chaos starts taking over the world. Earthquakes, sinkholes, fires and just overall madness starts happening as hell breaks lose (Pretty much literally). Jay witnesses several people getting beamed up to the sky while others remain, including all the celebs back at James' house. An earthquake and sinkhole right at the house forces the celebs to flee and many of then die while a few find shelter inside James' house. Now these five guys need to figure out how they can survive the madness inside James' house in the hopes of getting rescued alive while the also figure out exactly what is happening.<br/><br/>While I have my reservations when it comes to American comedies, specially ones involving half of the actors featured in this one, I have to admit several moments did make me laugh or at least had me intrigued by the narrative. The actors play a caricature of themselves which leads to plenty self aware jokes about their careers and the Hollywood industry in general. This movie is extremely over the top and doesn't take itself seriously at all. It is the kind of self aware humoristic flick that I would expect when you put names like Jonah Hill, Franco, Rogen and Craig Robinson together. Heck, even Rihanna and Emma Watson show up because why not.<br/><br/>The movie overall is nothing to claim awards for, the special effects are cheap which only add to the ridiculousness of all, and the choice for humor in this movie, just so you know, is not for the easily triggered. Body fluids, gore, drug use, rape jokes, everything pretty much goes. What made me enjoy this movie is seeing how far these people would go to expose and ridicule themselves and their own industry inside the ridiculous setting they are placed in. It is certainly a nice experiment that pushes the movie forward. Without this it wouldn't have had the same impact nor shock value.<br/><br/>In conclusion, you can live without ever watching this. But if you do make sure you do so with friends and with a few drinks if possible. And popcorn. Don't forget the popcorn. It's fun and it gives no f***s, and sometimes that's all you need."
"DeniseNY","4","1","2","2 December 2014"," Meant to be bad!
","OK, so This is the End is bad. Let's just get that out of the way. Yeah, it has plenty of sexual innuendo - well more than that, and a ton of drug and alcohol humor and pratfalls. Yes, it is bad, but it was meant to be bad. Once you get past that, you can actually open up a bit and allow yourself to be entertained. Honestly, I am convinced that James Franco and Seth Rogen dreamed up the plot in a crack-induced haze. In fact, they even spoof on that within the movie itself. So in order to appreciate this film, you need remember that it never takes itself seriously and neither should you. <br/><br/>In summary, the film is about a small group of actors who are trapped inside James Franco's home with limited supplies as the end of the world takes place just outside the doors. The actors play shallow, self indulgent, arrogant, egotistical, narcissistic versions of themselves. In other words, they are playing to just how the public perceives them to be! And that's where the jokes really stem from. With all the hot messes in Hollywood, it's hard to see any actor as an educated adult who simply has a career in entertainment. We see them as over-celebrated, spoiled, sex-crazed, alcoholic drug addicts, with no morals, too much money and completely out of touch with the real world. And that's EXACTLY the way they play themselves! <br/><br/>Once you get that joke, everything else falls in to place and it's really not all THAT bad. But don't expect it to be good. It's not. It's sick, satirical, very dark humor and it is meant to be distasteful and even offensive. They did that on purpose to shock you. See it once so you can see just what a twisted sense of humor Rogen, Franco, Baruchel, Hill, McBride and Robinson actually have.<br/><br/>I would have given the film an extra star if only they would have cast a Kardashian in to the abyss!"

"zetes","8","4","18","16 June 2013"," Very funny
","I wouldn't be too surprised if this turned out to be the funniest movie of 2013. It's kind of shabbily plotted, and its final half hour is a tad weak, but who cares when it's as funny as it is. The concept is pretty brilliant: a bunch of dopey Hollywood actors (everyone playing caricatures of themselves) barricade themselves in James Franco's house during the Biblical apocalypse. The six who are left alive: Franco, Seth Rogen, Jay Baruchel, Craig Robinson, Jonah Hill and Danny McBride. Tensions start to rise when McBride, the defacto villain, basically in full Kenny Powers mode, starts eating more than his share of food and wasting water. The film is at its funniest when the guys are just screwing around. At one point, when they're all bored out of their minds, the guys film an impromptu sequel to Pineapple Express. There are some pretty nifty, cheap-looking but fun special effects. The six main actors are all fantastically funny. It'd be hard to pick one out of any of them as the best (well, Baruchel kind of has the straight man role, so one might call him the least good, though he's still plenty funny). Michael Cera, who pops up at the party at the beginning of the film, might be the highlight playing a coke-snorting, woman molesting a-hole who gets his comeuppance in a particularly horrible way. Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg have built up a nice little career as writers (let's forget about The Green Hornet and The Watch). This is the first time they take the helm as directors, and they do a pretty good job. You definitely have to be a fan of these actors to like this movie, but if you are, you'll definitely enjoy yourself."

One example? Check out Emma Watson's rampage scene - it cannot be done any better - if you cannot laugh about this movie I truly feel for you because then you will never find anything to laugh/you must be dead/stiff inside, sorry, but it is true!

I loved the idea of the actors all playing themselves. For the most part they play the kind of character that is associated with them, but a bit exaggerated. And sometimes the character they perform is a bit surprising, like in Michael Cera's case. I couldn't stop laughing about him doing all the coke and having lots of sex. I was also very happy to see Craig Robinson as one of the main characters.<br/><br/>The end of the world idea was pretty good. It is a bit different than other apocalypse movies (well at least because it is a comedy and also has a devil in it).

This movie isn't complex, it's just a send-up of everything these actors are imagined to be (and probably aren't).<br/><br/>Popcorn required."

","The premise of this movie is terrific: Celebrities play themselves in a comedy about the end of the world. It's fun to see celebrities mock themselves, particularly a coked up Michael Cera, and much of the charm of the first scenes is simply seeing actors play with the concept.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the movie, but I can't say I loved it. It's funny, but it's not hilarious, and while the bits build and there is a sort of story, it's not fully developed because it's essentially a vehicle for the humor. <br/><br/>Also, the frat boy humor just wears thin. This movie is inordinately fond of jokes involving bodily excretions and genitalia, and what can be outrageous and edge in the first ten minutes can feel like a dead horse as the second hour commences. <br/><br/>It's nothing anyone really needs to watch, but it's a fairly enjoyable way to kill a couple of hours."

It's a movie my daughter who's 21 saw in the theater with friends first and then asked me to go see it with her again because she loved it and knew I would too. It's also a movie I get sucked into watching whenever it pops up on cable! If you loved Pineapple Express you'll love this movie. The plot is quite different but it still has the same brand of Seth Rogen, James Franco, Jonah Hill and Danny McBride buddy antics comedy along with Craig Robinson and Jay Baruchel! If you know these guys and their type of humor either from movies, TV shows or on YouTube then you know what to expect from them! In This Is The End they take it farther by making fun at their own expense by being in the movie as ""themselves""! There was some great cameo performances by Michael Cera, Paul Rudd, Channing Tatum, Rihanna and the best one of all Emma Watson! Again making it funnier because these folks too were playing ""themselves""! The only account I can make for the bad reviews here is these movie goers aren't fans of these guys or their type of comedy and went to see this film expecting something else and that is definitely their mistake and not the fault of the writers, actors, or the movie itself! If you are a fan of these guys or any of their previous work you are gonna thoroughly enjoy this movie! I highly recommend seeing this movie if you have a good sense of humor including a large dose of a ""R rated"" sense of humor!!!!"

"tomgillespie2002","7","2","7","5 October 2013"," An unexpected joy
","We all know the comedy formula by now - obnoxious man-child goes about  his business until a life-changing event (i.e. a girl) teaches him the  way of the world so that we gradually learn that he's really quite  sweet after all. It's a cliché fully embraced by silver screen comedy  megastars like Ben Stiller, Will Ferrell and Jack Black. Audiences,  clearly comfortable with predictability, flock to see their hugely  profitable films, because, as bad as their movies tend to be, they are  still lovable actors. Judd Apatow and his entourage of actors -  although they have made their fair share of bad movies too - seem  unsatisfied with simply offering the same thing over and over again.  First-time directors Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen here give us a  strange and dangerously self-indulgent end-of-the-world comedy with  some of Hollywood's most famous offering themselves up for lampooning,  resulting in a Marmite movie that I believe is the funniest of the year  so far.  L.A.-loathing Jay Baruchel arrives at the airport to be greeted by his  lifelong buddy Seth Rogen. The two go home and smoke some weed, and  eventually head over to James Franco's new Hollywood mansion for an A-  list party. Baruchel doesn't want to go because Jonah Hill will be  there, and Jonah is apparently an a**ehole. While Rogen mixes with his  new Hollywood buddies, Baruchel mopes on his own and watches Craig  Robinson sing 'take yo' panties off!' with Rihanna. But as Baruchel and  Rogen go to the store for some munchies, beams of light suddenly start  sucking people up into heaven, and the ground below them starts to  open. It seems the Rapture has passed them by and the apocalypse is  upon them. Holed up in Franco's mansion as demonic monsters prowl  outside, they must survive starvation, Emma Watson wielding an axe, an  exorcism, and most of all, an uninvited Danny McBride.  With disaster movies opening every other week these days, the vision of  the apocalypse brought by Goldberg and Rogen is actually rather well  done. A coked-up Michael Cera, who is previously seen receiving some  oral assistance in a bathroom, is given a particularly gruesome death,  while the likes of Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Jason Segel and Paul Rudd  are sucked into wormholes in the ground. It would seem obvious to most  normal people as to what these idiots need to do to escape their  predicament, but they are far too self-absorbed to realise. It's funny  how aware these actors are of their public perception, and they fully  embrace it. So Rogen is ribbed for playing the same guy in every movie  and is practically always seen with a joint in his mouth; Franco is the  robe-wearing, art-collecting 'pretentious nerd' (as McBride labels  him); Hill is subtly creepy; Robinson is just an extremely nice guy;  and McBride is psychotic and selfish. Baruchel, it seems, is the only  'normal' one, completely untainted by Hollywood.  But the point here is not that Hollywood is evil or that Hollywood  corrupts the soul. I don't really know what it's about, but at it's  centre there is the relatable story of lifelong friends that have grown  apart, but are still desperately clinging onto that special bond they  share. And it is this that makes the film so engrossing. The humour is  as bad taste as you would expect (at one point, Franco and McBride  threaten each other with ejaculation), but it's the emotional core that  dilutes all the cock jokes and gives the movie such much-needed  humanity. It won't be for everybody, and some of the general  strangeness will go over a lot of audience's heads. Goldberg and Rogen  have clearly seen far too many movies and therefore throw everything  but the kitchen sink at the film, but I found this a completely  unexpected joy, and an original one at that. Although it gets a bit too  ridiculous at the climax, the end note will have a big part of the  audience screaming with pleasure with a cameo or five by some  unexpected guests."

","Poor, poor Earth. It's met its doom countless times in the past several years. And recently, it's been more and more END OF TIMES stories hitting theatres.<br/><br/>Soyou want to make yet another Armageddon film? Why not create one of the most original concepts for that genre with Seth Rogen, James Franco, Jonah Hill, Jay Baruchel, Danny McBride and Craig Robinson (plus 20+ others) playing themselves in a send up mocking themselves?<br/><br/>While This is the End isn't the best movie I've seen in the stated, now over-used plot, it's one of the most hilarious and entertaining. The concept, alone, of all those mentioned actors (plus, again, 20+ others) playing themselves in a party at the end of days, is worth at least a star or two more than the rest of the film.<br/><br/>Said actors all party hard at James Franco's villa, and while the plot initially involves who likes who, who misses who and who just wants to party, the main theme happens when the mysterious blue light takes strangers up to the sky and earthquakes and sink holes swallows others. The remaining actors, and friends, must band together to ward off whatever is causing this massive destruction all around them.<br/><br/>Right now, I am granting this movie 4/5 stars and I know whyfor now. While the movie isn't perfect, and has it's dry moments, it's still interesting enough and funny enough to be ranked higher than average.<br/><br/>That saidin the future, this movie might improve with age. There are a ton of one-liners, inside jokes and hilarious scenes that I think this movie might grow on me with multiple viewings. It's a harmless film that never takes itself or the subject matter seriously and is only intention is to please.<br/><br/>Seriously, that's it. Seth, James, Jonah, Jay, Danny and Craig they all wanted to have a good time and give us one, too. So with any potential ""flaws,"" their intentions are pure enough that I know I will like this more with the second and (I guarantee) more viewings.<br/><br/>""Seth, that's some of the better acting than I've seen in your last six movies.

This movie far exceeded my expectations. Plenty of cameos, and the scenes with Michael Cera I am still laughing about in my head two days later. The special effects were amazing for a comedy and the jokes although very crude and immature are wet your pants hilarious and quite witty at times. The pace of the movie is flawless as there are no dull moments at all everything is fast paced and catches you of guard multiple times. This movie pushes limits so expect that. The scares are definitely not predictable as in most movies. All in all, stop reading this and go watch this movie.

I am normally the person in the crowd who just doesn't get the current crop of gross-out crude just for the sake of crude trend of humor nowadays but I got a kick out of this movie.<br/><br/>I am not really a laugh out loud kind of person when it comes to movies, no matter how funny I think it is, but I have to say I smiled for easily half the movie and laughed out loud a couple times. By the end I realized that my cheeks were just a bit sore from smiling. Some fun cameos, better special effects than I ever would have expected, and the usual gross out stuff that you would expect from every one of these actors. Plenty of drug use, foul language, nudity and other gratuitous stuff. Pretty par for the course nowadays. Why would you expect anything else? And why would anybody think the devil would wear pants? Of course his junk would be hanging out, and why wouldn't he be hung?<br/><br/>This movie is so over the top and unbelievable that you just have to relax and go with it. Is it high art? No. Will it get nominated for ANYTHING? Unlikely. It's an absurd and silly movie and you folks just need to lighten up.

"bkbirge","7","2","7","21 September 2013"," Hilarious, if unbalanced, skewering of Hollywood
","First things first, this is a gory movie in a very camp unrealistic way. So don't take the kids to it (do I even have to say that? yeah I guess I do these days).<br/><br/>The jokes center around drugs, absurd situations, booze, farts, sex, and more drugs. So on the surface it's pretty immature. Though if you like that kind of humor you need look no further as it's done well. But there are a couple things that make this movie worth a deeper look. <br/><br/>First, the whole theme of the movie is satirizing the self importance of young Hollywood stars. There's a reason the apocalypse happens to them. It's a quite brilliant setup that they manage to work through the whole movie. <br/><br/>Secondly, the ensemble improv acting of a bunch of real life friends playing alter-universe versions of themselves is a hoot to watch. There are some moments presumably due to the improv where scenes don't work quite as slick as they could but this isn't a tight plot driven movie. Overall the effect is that we've been invited to hang out with them while they just have fun making a movie. I love that when that happens but some people may not, it's a taste thing. <br/><br/>And the endless cameos of current young stars are a treat, particularly Michael Cera's bit part of insanity. However, Craig Robinson and Danny McBride steal the show here. They exude comedy in every scene they are in, whether deadpan or mugging. <br/><br/>As I said the movie is not without it's flaws. It does drag a bit here and there, some of the scenes could use tightening and joke pacing is hit or miss occasionally. For all that though I recommend it for fans of the absurd like Hell Baby, another partly improv'ed recent comedy."

Humor is painstaking at times, but some sequences will have you laugh your stomach out.

","This Is The End (Seth Rogen/Evan Goldberg, 2013) One of the craziest films I've seen in a while. Intriguing gimmick, using renowned young actors playing exaggerated versions of themselves, much like in Curb Your Enthusiasm or Extras. We never get an explanation as to why some people are sucked into Hell (seriously, what did Rihanna do that was so bad?) and why some were not. I'm not all that familiar with Danny McBride, but I have followed some of the work of the other main actors over the years. <br/><br/>This Is The End (for its first two-thirds, at least) is funnier than I expected. I put off seeing it at first because I couldn't imagine Rogen and Goldberg making a comedy about the Apocalypse starring a bunch of comic actors playing themselves, but they (mostly) pulled it off. The film does sort of lose its way during the last half hour, it must be said. All in all though, an enjoyable outing for its first hour but I didn't find the final scene, set in a certain location, to be all that imaginatively done. 6/10"

Nonetheless here is the Good, the Bad & the Ugly of the movie.<br/><br/>While attending a party at James Franco' house, Seth Rogen, Jay Baruchel and a mix of other celebrities are faced with the apocalypse.<br/><br/>*Warning – Contains Some Spoilers*<br/><br/>The Good – Seth Rogen/Evan Goldberg – The script and the direction of this movie was absolutely insane from start to finish. One minute we are partying at James Franco's house the next we are chasing around a burning Jonah Hill who's turned into the ""demon"". That line alone should make you want to see the movie. These characters playing themselves was a smart idea that really worked. While over the top in every aspect these guys put together a well-written and nicely directed film.<br/><br/>Seth Rogen the Actor – As shown in the movie, this guy has been in a bit of a funk. He was in Observe & Report, Green Hornet, and worst of all, The Guilt Trip. All movies were pretty terrible, but he came out swinging in this film. He was funny, witty and just everything that put this guy on the map. This was the Seth Rogen I hope we get to see in future films.<br/><br/>Jay Baruchel – While not my favorite character in the film, he played his part just fine and held his own against some other comedian powerhouses.<br/><br/>James Franco – I love this guy; he is so funny when he wants to be. Franco and Rogens Pineapple Express 2 trailer in the movie was one of the highlights. He brought his A game to the table in this film. I really feel he could've been lost in the shuffle with laughs with the other guys in the film.<br/><br/>Craig Robinson – He is funny, funny, and even funnier in every role this guy plays in. He had me on the brink of tears on many occasions in this film.<br/><br/>Jonah Hill – The banter between Hill & Baruchel was nothing short of comedy heaven. Hill stole the show with how he acted towards Baruchel.<br/><br/>Danny ""Show Stealer"" McBride – Literally my favorite guy to watch on TV, from Hot Rod to East Bound & Down, this guy is money. He was this movie; from the time he appeared on the screen till the final scene he was funny. He played this role to perfection. He will have you laughing hysterically in this film.<br/><br/>The Cameos – Michael Cera was easily the best cameo, even up to the point where he was getting blown in the bathroom and drinking a Capri-sun to blowing a huge thing of coke in McLovin(Mintz-Plasse) face. My other favorite was Emma Watson (boy does she look as good as ever); she was surprisingly quite funny in her extended cameo in this. The rest were great and even a few surprises I won't spoil.<br/><br/>The Laughs – I have not laughed so hard at a movie since I watched the Hangover. This is what a comedy is supposed to be! Start to finish laugh out loud punch lines and jokes.<br/><br/>The Bad – Not being picky about anything in this film, it was hilarious.<br/><br/>The Verdict– 4 ½ out of 5 Stars<br/><br/>This will easily be comedy of the year and I am not sure anything will come close. This is the best comedy to hit the theaters since the 1st Hangover. Seth Rogen is brilliant for what he brought to the table in this movie. This is not a wait for RedBox, Netflix, Flixter, TNT or ABC type of movie. This is a get off your butt and go see movie when it hits theaters on Wednesday.<br/><br/>http://thesportsscript.com/2013/06/07/this-is-the-end-review/"

","This film is recommended. <br/><br/>Take a group of today's younger comedians and actors, mix in an apocalyptic nightmare scenario, and add plenty of raunchiness and sexual hi-jinks and you have a film like This is The End. Brought to you from the same team that produced Superbad and Pineapple Express, two films that left me underwhelmed, This is The End tries so hard to raise the level of shock value and tastelessness and although the film completely loses sight of the bigger picture, it has an abundance of laughs amid all the lewdness. <br/><br/>This is The End wants to create genuine laughs at the expense of the next Hollywood Brat Pack with a better-them-than-us mentality. It wisely trades on their likability factor and the public's general perception of these performers from their previous films. The actors play themselves, real-life best friends caught in the aftershock of the turbulence surrounding them, as the world as they know it, spins out of control. <br/><br/>There's a party at James Franco's home and Seth Rogen Jonah Hill, and Craig Robinson are just some of the invited guests, along with Jay Baruchel. As more party-goers arrive, so does the Rapture. Other party-goers turned survivalists include: Danny McBride, Emma Watson, and Michael Cera, who is hilarious as he plays against his own geeky type . There are also many surprising cameos from other celebrities with mixed results and funny visual riffs of other films like Rosemary's Baby, The Exorcist, and even Ghostbusters. One by one, the actors send up their own screen personas. (Franco, Rogen, and Hill fare best.)<br/><br/>The cleverness of this conceit adds some humor and it is that camaraderie that helps to make the film succeed up to a point. The inside jokes and banter skews their stereotypical public images as stoners, doofuses, and nerds are thrown from one catastrophe to the next. <br/><br/>Where the film begins to falter is in its execution. The film downplays their dire situation at the expense of its own plot structure. While laughs are frequent and the childish antics remain character-driven, the story itself begins to ramble. The ramping up of sex and violence (quite graphic at times) tends to upend the well-earned comedic elements.<br/><br/>Written and directed by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, the film entertains while it perverts the notion of celebrity worship, ethical dilemmas, religious dogma, and the lack of moral conscience and one-upsmanship in today's self-serving society. That's a lot to digest from a film which is really a basic teen comedy in disguise. Still, the film's biggest asset is its savage wit in pushing the satirical elements to exaggerated proportions. Unfortunately, the film never knows when to say when. It continually overdoes its grossness and vulgarity and becomes a bit exhausting with all its excesses on full display, leading to a rather silly ending after all the hoopla.<br/><br/>This is The End is a series of endless outrageous pranks that may shock and appall some moviegoers while thoroughly delight others. Audience reaction will run the gamut depending on your own comfort level of irreverent humor. As for me, I enjoyed much of the fun, the crude humor, and even the offensive jokes of This is The End.

The movie was directed by first time film directors Seth Rogen and Evan  Goldberg and also written by the duo (the team has wrote multiple other  hit comedies together like 'SUPERBAD', 'PINEAPPLE EXPRESS', 'THE GREEN  HORNET' and 'THE WATCH'). They also wrote the short this film is based  on, 'JAY AND SETH VERSUS THE APOCALYPSE', with it's director Jason  Stone. That 2007 short also starred Rogen and Baruchel as two guys  trapped in a room together as the world ends. Rogen and Goldberg not  only continue their reputation as great comedic writers here but also  prove themselves to be excellent directors.

The two haven't seen each other in a while and  go back to Seth's place to celebrate (by watching movies on a 3D TV and  smoking weed). Seth then talks Jay into going to a party at James  Franco's house (full of celebrities that are all Franco and Rogen's  friends) even though Jay doesn't feel comfortable around Seth's  friends, who he doesn't know very well. Jay meets Franco and Craig  Robinson for the first time at the party and is also reintroduced to  Jonah Hill, who he has a strong disliking for. Feeling uncomfortable  and like an outsider Jay talks Seth into going to the local convenience  store with him and that's when the apocalypse starts. Things begin  blowing up and people start getting sucked into the sky. They rush back  to Franco's house and become trapped there with him, Robinson, Hill and  an uninvited Danny McBride.  The movie is hilarious from start to finish. What's most funny about  the film is perhaps how Rogen, Baruchel and the others present  themselves as very relatable average people that have just been  corrupted by fame and fortune. Everyone in the film is presented as  pretty unlikeable (some more than others) except for Baruchel (who for  me is always very likable and extremely relatable). He's the heart of  the film, and kind of the viewer's guide through it, but the movie also  focuses heavily on friendship (most of all Rogen and Baruchel's) and  relationships with acquaintances (good ones and bad). The awkward  relationships developed in the film lead to some of it's funniest  moments but like all of Rogen's films the movie has a very positive and  heartfelt message about friendship. It also has a somewhat spiritual  message about being a better person. The messages of the film are of  course exaggerated and pretty cheesy though (for the most part). It's  most of all a laugh riot. The film does grow a little long and tiresome  (slightly) towards the end but it has a great conclusion and is mostly  flawless (as a comedy). Rogen and Goldberg do an outstanding job  writing and debut directing but it's the cast that really makes the  film and I think it's great that they're all willing to poke so much  fun at themselves, the way they do in this movie!"
"TyRawrrnosaurus","8","4","21","12 June 2013"," Big on Laughs, Short on Plot
","As far as comedies go, 2013 has been slacking. A few laughs and a couple of giggles, but nothing has truly stuck out enough to break my funny bone. That is until I saw This Is The End. The epic, star-studded comedy brings the Apatow bunch to a whole new level; thanks in-part to co-writers and directorial debut of Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg. As the world comes to its ultimate demise, This Is The End makes good on delivering one of the raunchiest, most entertaining movies of the year. No topic is taboo and no one is safe.<br/><br/>The events leading up to the apocalypse begin with Jay Baruchel, who has come from Canada to visit Seth Rogen in Los Angeles. These two best friends make up our main protagonists, as this story is based on the original short film Jay and Seth vs. The Apocalypse. As pizza, video games, alcohol, and of course a lot of pot is consumed, Jay comes to find that Seth would like the two of them to attend James Franco's house party. Cautiously reluctant – because he finds Seth's new LA buddies threatening to their friendship – Jay concedes and they both head over to Franco's ridiculously large mansion complete with Freaks and Geeks art and penis sculptures.<br/><br/>Craig Robinson, Jonah Hill, Emma Watson, Michael Cera, Mindy Kaling, Rihanna, and Aziz Ansari – mentioning any more would ruin the fun of the cameos – live it up as the night progresses, indulging in on the pleasures of Hollywood society. But just as the party finds its groove, tremors drive everyone outside only to find Los Angeles engulfed in flames. Panicked, everyone runs about in their own way to find safety as if someone yelled ""fire"" in a crowded club. Rogen, Baruchel, Franco, Robinson, and Hill bunker down in Franco's palace and board up the doors and windows. Unbeknownst to them, the next morning they find Danny McBride alive and kicking, but eating all of their rations. The six friends must quickly learn to get along and kick in their survivalist instincts if they are to ever make it through the end of the world.<br/><br/>The theory of bringing all of these talented actors together to play themselves is quite unfamiliar territory, but everyone, including the secondary ""characters"" steps up their game to perform admirably. (On a side note, there seems to be a lot of ragtag team movies lately ever since The Avengers made it big, i.e. Fast & Furious 6, Gangster Squad, Now You See Me.) Although everyone is playing themselves, there is a degree of character to each of the actors to amplify the conflict and dynamic of the group. I'm sure each of these actors are buddy buddy in real life, but that would get boring to see on the screen. I like that they can each be themselves while also adding a little flair to their personas.<br/><br/>Similarly to Superbad, this film tells the tale of two friends who have become increasingly distant. This is the main through line of our story aside from the immediate danger lurking outside casa de Fracno. There is also a little social commentary on celebrity status and Hollywood. And even though this is a comedy at heart, elements of horror, suspense, and action get mixed in making for great genre twisting fun.<br/><br/>This Is The End relies heavily on the audience to have been following the work of these actors for quite some time. There is a ton of referential humor that mention films such as Pineapple Express, Your Highness, 127 Hours, and The Green Hornet so casually in conversation it would be hard to understand if you haven't seen them. This type of comedy may not be for everyone, but if you enjoy these actors, and have seen most of their filmography, all of the jokes will payoff without fail. Strangely enough, while every single moment had me rolling on the ground, all of the jokes are not very memorable. The issue here is that the film lacks a certain heart.<br/><br/>Superbad is incredibly funny because throughout all the crazy antics you have a sense of commitment to the characters and care about their friendship. And here you couldn't really care less about any of them. With full emphasis on the comedy, the rookie directors seem to have forgotten all about the true conflict within the story. As soon as the chaos begins to wreck havoc on Earth, the dispute between Seth and Jay is thrown to the wayside as the group struggles to survive.<br/><br/>As knee-slapping as I find this movie, the middle of This Is The End meanders, making the story feel longer than it should be. It would make sense that this story originated as a short film. The whole second act feels directionless and very stretched out. They could have cut out a lot in order to strengthen the relationship between Baruchel and Rogen or put the characters in more situations that would have tested their friendship to forward the story. It takes them awhile to eventually leave the house and it makes for a very rushed ending.<br/><br/>Undoubtedly, This Is The End exceeded my expectations as a fan of all of these actors. Anyone who enjoys this cast of misfits will be greatly rewarded by a film that holds nothing back. On the surface this movie is a gas, and my only wish is that it could have delved deeper into the lives of Jay and Seth so that we could invest more attention to their friendship. Regardless, if you're looking for a really, really fun time at the movies, This Is The End will not disappoint."
"jenhoelter","8","4","21","10 June 2013"," Raunchy, stoner, coming of age film; fails Bechdel
","For its genre, this is the end is a satisfying mélange of post-modern apocalyptic movie tropes, vulgar language, and stomach-turning visuals (I covered my eyes in at least 5 scenes.) Nudity is refreshingly minimal, making it all the more shocking. The celebrity cameos are fun and frequent.<br/><br/>Emma Watson was charming as a party guest and thrilling in her return post sinkhole. She is so sympathetic that I wish we were privy to a ""heroineHermione"" moment that made her rapture worthy or even a winking shot of her in the heavenly finale.<br/><br/>The always excellent Mindy Kaling stops by the party in a memorable scene. Rihanna is beautiful and seems quite natural on camera.<br/><br/>The only other named woman is Karen, Franco's assistant. I honestly don't remember Karen or an assistant of any sort.<br/><br/>I was blessed to be able to see this movie at no cost as part of a press promotion at my local theater. I was planning to see it anyway and liked it enough that I may see it again with different company, but probably not for full price. The audience was on-board with the humor and laughter was hearty throughout the movie. Like about 1/2 the crowd I stuck around in hope of a final scene but there was none. I will definitely rent this is the end, especially if they release an unrated version as I cannot imagine what didn't make the cut."
"Staffenburgen","7","3","14","18 June 2013"," Absolutely Hilarious
","After seeing the trailer for this movie, I had mixed expectations. Mostly this stemmed from the fact that this is the first directing effort from Rogen and Goldberg, and although I have enjoyed some of Rogen and Goldberg's previous movies (like Superbad), I was worried that they might not be up for directing just yet. As for the actors, I love Seth and the rest of the Apatow crew, but this movie in particular struck me as one that would be overdone, with too many ridiculous cameos and plot points, and become unfunny as a result. <br/><br/>It turns out I was actually right about it being completely ridiculous, but I was dead wrong about it being unfunny. I honestly haven't laughed this hard in a two hour span since the original Hangover; scene after scene in this movie is just filled with hilarity. The concept here is really fresh as well. I loved that the actors played themselves, as that really opened the door for some unique moments, and as the script plays out, you can't help but admire Rogen and Goldberg for their creativity. <br/><br/>All of the actors in this film are hilarious, but in particular Mcbride, Robinson, and Franco consistently had me laughing. Jonah Hill's role is not at all what you'd expect, and I also really enjoyed him. As for Rogen and Baruchel, they take more of a backseat on the laughs, choosing instead to make their characters the heart of the movie. This is really important, especially in a film this raunchy and over-the-top. <br/><br/>In addition to the stellar main cast, this movie is littered with several cameos, all of which are hilarious. I won't reveal many names so as not to give anything away, but Michael Cera in particular had the entire theater struggling for air. I don't even usually think of Cera as that funny, but he's great in this movie. Emma Watson also stands out in her cameo role. <br/><br/>The one gripe I have with the film is it does trail off slightly near the end. The last ten or fifteen minutes of the film were a bit less funny than I would've hoped, but I thought the conclusion was ultimately satisfying. <br/><br/>I am definitely going to go see this again, mostly because I'm sure I missed some of the jokes by laughing right over top of the them. I'd recommend this to anyone who likes raunchy comedies, and bring all your friends, because it definitely makes it better. <br/><br/>So, I was wrong. Rogen and Goldberg proved to me that they are ready for the director's chair(s), and I'm definitely excited to see what they come up with next.<br/><br/>RATING: 8/10"

"Reno-Rangan","8","2","8","19 September 2013"," Ridiculously hilarious and totally enjoyable
","This movie came as a surprise package, totally enjoyable, ridiculously hilarious and I thoroughly entertained. It stars all the new gen rising stars especially the actors from comedy stream. Seth Rogen, Jay, James Franco, Jonah Hill, Danny McBride and many others are just awesome. But I thought Channing Tatum's cameo was a bit foolish and others come for couple of frames. Could you believe it Seth Rogen directed this movie, well he did a hell of a job in the first movie.<br/><br/>Pretty acceptable graphics for a fantasy movie, but sometimes it was dirty and sexual. The story centers around the Hollywood celebrities who meet at a party thrown by James Franco and soon after everything turns hell when the beginning of the end roll out. A bunch of celebrities trapped in a house preparing for the apocalypse and doing everything they could to protect each others.<br/><br/>The filmmaker superbly used the theme songs and movie songs especially the Backstreet Boys' song during the end of the movie for a dance like 'Slumdog Millionaire'. So far it was one of a fine comedy of the year which was based on the short video. Loved it, hope you will do same as well. Recommended.<br/><br/>8/10"

","I'm so glad I saw this movie, it made me smile, laugh and reconsider the meaning of life! It is ART, comedy art anyway! I believe this movie is for a certain group of people, not everyone will enjoy it as much as I did. First of all you need to have the same humor as Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, that's the first step. Secondly, you must like B-movies, because that's what it is, but a really good one. It's like Zombieland (2009). If you got this, IT'S for you! I'm not a fan of comedy movies or their acting but it actually worked in this movie, James Franco and Emma Watson helped them a lot but they did good overall! <br/><br/>It's not only a comedy, they managed to put a bit of horror inside it as well and it makes you fall off the chair (with the right volume in your speakers)because it's so unexpected which is fun at the same time. I'm usually not the one that jumps of the couch but I did. XD<br/><br/>I recommend you to do a little bit of research before you watch this movie, by doing that you'll know what to expect from it!"

","THIS IS THE END has many things to recommend it. There's the awesome special effects, which show characters crashing into the pit of hell. There's the poignantly shown rituals of male bonding, even in the face of all-but-certain doom. There's the inevitable bad apple in the bunch, capable of swiping the last Milky Way bar left in the city. There's the beheaded guy, whose soccer abilities recall the final scene of HOSTEL 2. There are the invaluable tips for surviving during a Rapture event, which spell out the nitty-gritty details with more authority than any of the movies in the LEFT BEHIND series. There is the ability to capture the atmosphere of a Rapture, which was barely scratched in that otherwise compelling flick, RED STATE. There is the study of the psychological underpinnings of survival rationing, taken much further than in Hitchcock's WWII classic, LIFEBOAT. There are the believable characterizations offered by James Franco, Jonah Hill, Jay Baruchel, Danny McBride, Craig Robinson, Michael Cera, and the rest of the all-star cast all playing themselves--you just KNOW this is how these people would act during an ACTUAL Rapture event! But--most of all--there's Emma Watson, yup--Hermione herself!--wielding an axe!!"

"Kookyburra","9","2","8","19 July 2013"," Extremely funny
","Went into this with mixed feelings, thought it might be a bit self indulgent or full of in jokes and while at times it was probably both of those things, for the most part it was just extremely funny. <br/><br/>Kind of like watching a really long episode of your favourite sitcom. The true talent of the script was to very quickly set up the characters (exaggerated versions of themselves or playing up to / against their public personas) and then just give them lots of space to riff off of each other, make loads of alternating self deprecating / aggressive comments. <br/><br/>The humour is vicious at times but there's also a real warmth in the relationships. So it's both really funny and with that feel-good feeling you get from truly great comedies. Maybe at times it wanders to far into the realm of fantasy and it would have been nice to have the pre apocalypse scenes extended a little. I'm hoping that the Blu-Ray will have lots of deleted scenes. <br/><br/>So yeah, I liked it. And I went in with no expectations so I'd recommend this one to anyone. Best comedy I've seen in a long time."
"dexydude","9","2","8","12 July 2013"," Why all the negative reviews
","First of all I gave this film a nine because in my opinion this is the end is as close to a perfect comedy there is. It's hilarious and will you will be entertained throughout the whole movie if you love crude humor-which I do.its contains many actors and it seemed like Evan Goldberg just called half of the contacts on his phone and asked them to be in this film which in my opinion was a great idea. This would of Attracted a larger audience as these actors are very popular. On the other hand if you watched this movie to see an actor such as Kevin Hart or Jason Segel this movie would have been a major disappointment but luckily in my case I am a fan of pretty much everyone in this movie.<br/><br/>Another important thing I need to address about this movie is the approach they went for. In this is the end they went for an over the top approach so if your not the sort of person who likes this sort of thing then the ending will most definitely disappoint you.<br/><br/>I also thought I would mention that Danny Mcbride just completely steals the show from the moment you see him till his final scene but at the start of the movie Michael Cera is funnier then he has ever been. Cera plays himself as a douche-bag who's life orientates around drugs and sex is an innuendo for him being extremely calm, very respectful towards woman and has managed to earn himself the nickname, 'the nicest guy in Hollywood'<br/><br/>The main things I liked about this movie were: References to other movies and how they were added to make you laugh. Danny Mcbrides priceless humor. The amazing ending. The amount of actors and actresses.<br/><br/>The main thing I disliked about this movie: Some people were in the: movie for only about 30 seconds or in Paul Rudd case 5 seconds.<br/><br/>Final thoughts: You must see this movie! I loved it so much that I held in a pee for half an hour because I wanted to know what was going to happen, I didn't want to miss one of many the hysterical jokes in the film and I was loving it so much. In fact too much!"

If you're a fan of Rogan and his click of friends, I don't see how you won't love This is the End. It gets wild and unrealistic but it's all in good fun. I watched it and Man of Steel this weekend and let me tell you that This is the End has more realistic and connect-able characters in it than that big budget sh!+ sandwich I had to eat while setting through Man of Steel. There's great ""Rogan"" comedy throughout this film with the buddy atmosphere you want in a movie with a cast of characters like this. If, like me, you enjoyed Pineapple Express the most of the ever growing long list of Rogan comedies, know that I rank this movie right up there with Superbad, Pineapple, Zack & Miri, etc...<br/><br/>8 of 10 - It'll only ever be appreciated by fans but if you like the other films these guys make you'll enjoy this one too."

Yeah. Immature at times, yeah. Absolutely laugh out loud gut busting humor at times, yup. I won't recap any of the plot because it doesn't matter.

"Quinoa1984","10","2","9","4 February 2015"," outrageous fun, and a solid satire on fame
","You don't expect that a movie that purports to be a silly comedy about the end of the world happening to the ""real"" Seth Rogen, James Franco, Jonah Hill, Danny McBride, Craig Robinson and Jay Baruchel to have poignancy or a satirical message, but that is what you actually get here. As the directorial debut for Rogen and long-time collaborator Evan Goldberg, they really put the work into this. A 30 million dollar flick that looks bigger and bolder than it does, though weirder than you'd expect at times. Mostly, it's full of gross-out gags and tasteless jokes.<br/><br/>But why then does it work so well, as a laugh-a-minute (even more sometimes) comedy that, up to a point, even takes it characters seriously? Because the actors have, naturally a rapore, and don't mind making knuckleheads of themselves. It's also an example of dumb being done smart, which can also be seen in Superbad and Knocked up and up to a point in The Green Hornet (The Interview, their follow-up, is even bolder and mostly works as well).<br/><br/>Celebrity culture can be easy to lampoon, but the targets here are not exactly obscure or in-jokey, at least too much. When McBride shows up, practically unannounced, eating all of the character's stashed-away-for-the-duration food at Franco's place and proceeds to mock them mercilessly, every line is a zinger and is funny even if you don't know (by some chance) that Hill got nominated for an Oscar for Moneyball. Rogen and Golderg rely on the character's behavior, and a knowingness that the characters do dumb things.<br/><br/>The difference in quality between this and more super-low-brow stuff - let's say the Scary Movies flicks - is in the timing and quick-witted spontaneity and the embracing of the crude humor. When a demon shows up with a big swinging, uh, phallus, it certainly isn't subtle. But if just reading that you chuckle, then you know what you're in for. The actors are all game for being made jokes out of one another, and recognizing their idiocy especially in the back-drop that is presented here. And it's a real MOVIE as well, the filmmakers take the back-drop seriously and present it not as a joke - it can be rather terrifying to see some of the crazy things happen around these character (rapturing, holes in the ground sucking people in, fires, demons, crazy CGI creatures).<br/><br/>Among all this, the ""characters"" are, to varying degrees, self-obsessed ego-heads (Hill especially gets a fun part to play as himself with a 'Oh, I act nice, but really I'm this"" sort of guy), all basically not equipped for such an apocalypse as is happening to them, and Rogen/Golderg have great enjoyment, but take seriously within the scope of what they set out to do, in making the character dynamics count. So, within the scope of the story, every character has something to do, a viewpoint, even (gasp) arcs to go through, all leading up to that wonderful plot device known as the Rapture.<br/><br/>Ultimately, This is the End is all in good fun, revels in the ups-and-downs of these characters and their conflicts that bring them down to base levels, and the mockery is knowing and clever. It's also stylish and fun, and shows young filmmakers really strapping in and taking people for a ride. It's the kind of flick you can watch over and over. Especially if you have been aching to see PIneapple Express 2 featuring Woody Harrelson."
"Floated2","9","2","9","19 August 2014"," One of The Funniest Films in a While
","Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, as co-writers and co-directors adapting director Jason Stone's short, capture denial as coping mechanism in the face of the unimaginable, while also satirizing stardom, poking fun at rich-stoner foibles and, generating genuine dread and despair. For all its visual effects' evidently low-budget seams, and with full acknowledgment of gross-out moments that make this movie not for everyone, This Is the End is masterful comedy film making, all the more impressive for its loose-limbed apparent casualness.<br/><br/>With all the stars playing fictional versions of themselves, Baruchel and Rogen—friends since at least Judd Apatow's cult-classic TV series ""Undeclared"" and since then part of Apatow's informal movie repertory company—attend a party at James Franco's concrete mansion in L.A. There, the guest roster includes Craig Robinson, a suspiciously obsequious Jonah Hill, Michael Cera—depicted as a gold-plated jerk who feels up Rihanna, getting punched in the process, and blowing a cloud of cocaine into the face of non-user Christopher Mintz-Plasse—along with Mindy Kaling, David Krumholtz, Martin Starr, Paul Rudd, Kevin Hart, Aziz Ansari and Jason Segel in cameos. When suddenly faced with what they think is just an unusually destructive earthquake that's spawned fires and a huge sinkhole, most of them die in the ensuing everyone-for- themselves panic and the aforesaid sinkhole.<br/><br/>Franco, Hill, Robinson, Baruchel and Rogen survive and barricade themselves, as Baruchel, who was in a convenience store with Rogen when the earthquake hit, describes seeing people borne up into the skies in rays of blue light. At first no one believes him—Rogen had been covered with detritus from the tremor and saw nothing—but by the time some neighbor begging to be let in gets decapitated and evidently eaten by some growling thing outside, a growing sense of infinitely terrible possibilities takes hold. Then Danny McBride, whom no one knew had shown up invited, appears the next morning behaving pretty much like his on screen persona in HBO's Eastbound & Down, which is to say of the first order—while an ax-wielding Emma Watson proves surprisingly. ""Hermione just stole all of our (food),"" McBride deadpans to a confessional camera recording their last days. As pointed out McBride steals the show here, every scene he is in is a pleasure to watch, including his back and forth conversation with Franco. I feel that the film goes somewhat down hill once he leaves. The ending was not too great, although unpredictable. This is the End is a great comedy definitely not for everyone's comedic taste. If you are a fan of Seth Rogen type comedies (Pineapple Express, Knocked Up), I don't see how one would be left completely disappointed (at least not to have several laughs)."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","2","9","7 December 2013"," The Apatow disciples put a fresh spin on their comedy
","Even an outrageous stoner comedy can successfully appeal to a wide audience with a little ingenuity. ""This Is the End"" could've stopped at being a comedy in which a bunch of friends are faced with the apocalypse, but what really makes Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen's film work is that there's a big glass window where a fourth wall ought to be.<br/><br/>""This Is the End"" takes advantage of those who count tabloids and celebrity news amongst their guilty pleasures, creating a sense of being shown behind the curtain and feeling on the inside just by having all the actors play themselves and making sporadic jokes about their real-life careers. As the film goes on, the actors become characters more than they actually play themselves and the authenticity wears off, but part of what makes the movie so effectively funny is that it peels off certain layers that 99.9 percent of other films (not labeled documentaries) have, regardless of how closely these actors all resemble their actual personalities.<br/><br/>Rogen and Jay Baruchel star (again, as character versions of themselves) as old-time best friends drifting slowly apart. Baruchel comes to Los Angeles to stay with Rogen, who insists they party with his other Hollywood friends including Jonah Hill, James Franco and Craig Robinson. It's not Baruchel's scene, but he puts up with it. At the party, however, the Earth begins to shake, fires erupt everywhere and sinkholes form in the earth, including right outside Franco's house. A number of actors and celebrities playing themselves in cameos die, including a coked-up Michael Cera and other A-listers whom under normal movie circumstances we aren't used to seeing get killed off just like that.<br/><br/>Baruchel, Rogen, Franco, Hill, Robinson and a crazy, reckless Danny McBride end up (for the most part) the lone survivors and board themselves up in Franco's house. Their attempts to figure out how to survive become the comic material from that point forward, along with some satanic twists. Meanwhile, their attitudes toward each other rear their ugly heads and cause even more friction.<br/><br/>This all sounds like a thought-out, creative, original comedy plot, but some will see it as nothing but a dumb comedy masquerading as something innovative. Rogen and Goldberg are up to their same-old humor: masturbation jokes, random references, lewd physical humor and penises abound. But they innovate just enough to give their shtick a fresh coat of paint. Comedy trends and actors come and go; if these Apatow disciples want to remain relevant beyond this first decade, this is the kind of creativity that will be required of them. Simple, clever and effective.<br/><br/>The film is garbage as a take on the apocalypse; it's all about the social scenarios that emerge from it. The few action sequences and visual effects scenes are borderline horrendous, but it doesn't jump into these dumb stoner-movie parts until after sufficiently building up the character-focused parts of the story.<br/><br/>That said, it's hard to buy into the bromantic heart of ""This Is the End"" unlike previous movies featuring these guys (""Superbad,"" ""Pineapple Express,"" etc.). Rogen and Goldberg assume because the actors are playing themselves that this establishes a relationship dynamic between Seth and Jay to the point that we're willing to root for them to overcome the riff they endure in the film. That, or Rogen and Goldberg just didn't care. Either way, their films usually succeed more at creating sincere relationship moments and they end up empty in this one.<br/><br/>""This Is the End"" marks a successful experiment at twisting familiar genre tropes into something novel.

","I never read reviews before watching movies and I am glad I didn't. So many people said this movie sucked but I completely disagree. It was freaking hilarious and I was completely absorbed the whole time. No dull moments and acting was superb! If you are looking for clean, ""nanny humor"" (which I think is boring imo), take a hike. It amazes me how narrow of a sense of humour some people have. I love a good offensive, dirty humor and I just about pee'd myself laughing the whole movie. If you are like me and like the movies most of the main actors from this were in previously (knocked up, pineapple express, etc...), then you'll love this guaranteed. Enough with the seriousness folks! This movie is about kicking back and enjoying some laughs without having to think much!"

","The movie is either really tough to sell or you will be overjoyed watching it. I can't (as many who have watched it) the least bit of neutral rating and writing about it. I thought it was funny as hell (pun intended)! But this won't be seen as such by some, because humor is really very specific to people. Things that I thought were hilarious, other people will find boring.<br/><br/>The ending, without giving it away of course, will only appeal to certain audiences too. And it's all because of a joke that hit close to home with the actors (and filmmakers I suppose). I was delighted by it, but there has to be some knowledge to get it and even think of it as funny joke. Generally speaking most jokes and the movie itself was made as a labor of love and I'm sure was what Rogen and the others thought of as funny. This isn't Being John Malkovich! This is the lowest common denominator! Are you ready to entertained on that level? Than try it out! If you want something substantial, you might want to look at other movies though"

","This Is The End is completely bonkers, and that's what makes it work. This sort of R-rated comedy is usually hit or miss with me overall, and while not all of the jokes in this one hit right (the rape jokes in particular, get to be way too much as it goes on) it's overall, whole satisfying and hilarious. Not only is it hilarious though, but it has an inventive and truly unique concept here for a comedy, one that I can only wonder how giddy these people were when they came up with it. The whole cast does some fine, fine work and they all work as truly unique individuals and characters here, and the climax is truly magnificent. There isn't many other ways to describe how much I loved this film, but it's truly so well done and it's destined to be a cult classic of some sort. Oh, and the final scene with the appearance by a certain artist was, well, shocking!"

","I enjoy the blasphemy thoroughly. Didn't get from the trailers that it was going to go that way but the instant it hits it's just pure amusement. Was definitely some weak spots in the writing/movie where I thought they went softer than they should have and switched to more childish humor. Good twist that where unexpected that's for sure and that is the reason it gets a solid 8. This is a movie that I am going to watch again when it hits BlueRay. If your into movies that make you laugh out loud then this movie may be for you. If you need an instructional video on how to make it through the rapture then this movie too is for you. As long as your not prudish and understand that comedy can be just comedy, then this movie is for you! If I had to compare this movie to something it would have to be to the way Ray Charles Robinson took Gospel music and gave it his own twist, most liked it, some did not. This movie will get the same kind of fanfare, most will like it!"

","As many have pointed out, this movie follows in the same vein as Super Bad. This Is The End is entertaining and hilarious. The fact that main cast and the ""extras"" were unafraid to make fun of themselves and the Hollywood community was brilliant. The end result is a film that feels more like a crazy version of MTV's Real World, instead of a movie.<br/><br/>A side from all fun storytelling and the laughs, the film does manage to make (some) religious references and reinforce the whole idea of being the best version of yourself. However, when the lights come back on in the theatre it is almost guaranteed you'll forget all about that, and instead start repeating the very memorable the one-liners (e.g. all of Michael Cera's lines during the party scene).<br/><br/>Bottom line is this film takes advantage of its R rating to give the audience a solid 107 minutes of laughs."

","This is one of those movies that you have to watch in a group of friends, preferably when there are lots of distractions around so you'll think it's funnier than it is. I would never have watched this movie on my own, and while the company and party atmosphere helped, it still wasn't my cup of tea. In general, I hate end-of-the-world movies and avoid them like the plague. For the sake of this review, I'll try to be kind and realize that many people out there do like that genre.<br/><br/>If you do like that genre, and you like buddy comedies that feature the same group of pals you've seen together in many movies, you might consider renting this one. Everyone plays his or herself in this movie, so it feels much more like the guys filmed themselves at a party rather than a Hollywood film that's been thoroughly thought through. James Franco hosts a party at his house, and his pals Seth Rogen, Jonah Hill, Jay Baruchel, Danny McBride, and Craig Robinson, have a great time until the world starts to end. Tons of people wanted to be in this movie, so you'll see cameos by Michael Cera, Mindy Kaling, Emma Watson, Rihanna, Channing Tatum, Kevin Hart, Paul Rudd, Jason Segel, Martin Starr, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Aziz Ansari, and the Backstreet Boys.<br/><br/>If you don't generally like the movies made by this crop of actors, you probably won't like this one. Most of the enjoyment will probably come from knowing how much fun the actors had making it and improvising what they thought was funny at the time. A good rule of thumb: watch the preview and if you like it, you'll probably like the movie.<br/><br/>Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to language and frightening scenes, I wouldn't let my kids watch it."

","I didn't like this one. It had some genuinely hilarious moments but overall it was a big disappointment. I always like when Holywood makes fun of itself and the idea of a whole bunch of famous comedians playing themselves in a apocalyptic movie sounded like an amazing premise. The problem is that they portayed themselves as such selfish idiots that after awhile you want them to die...and yet they end up in heaven.

","It's not often I disagree with James Berardinelli at reel-views. In fact, I watched this film as he had given it three stars and said it was as funny as The Hangover, which is one of the few Hollywood comedies I have enjoyed in recent years. Unfortunately, I have to disagree with him on this one. I found it irritating rather than humorous and the self-indulgent actors performances were not convincing. Probably a good idea when they were high on some night out, but in reality it just turned out to be another sub-standard Hollywood comedy that insults the intelligence of any one of discerning taste. Very disappointing."

I never laughed so hard and the jokes were spot on.<br/><br/>It does contain the usual trademarks of language, violence and suggestive scenes. But it really works as a strength instead of a lazy attempt at writing a script that other new comers try out.<br/><br/>The special effects look real on a small budget and it helps set you inside the movie universe. <br/><br/>Don't be turned off by the trailer and give it a shot.

","The fact that so many of the user ratings for this film are poles apart reinforces a truth about comedy: There are many different types, and not everybody responds equally well to them all. This film is filled with gratuitous bad language, sophomoric sexual references, and weed — lots and lots of people smoking weed. So if any of those things bother you, don't see the film. <br/><br/>I, however, found it very funny indeed. The humour is based on things such as: Well-known actors ostensibly playing themselves, but doing so in a way that pokes fun at the stereotypically- superficial and neurotic lifestyles of celebrity L.A. actors; and everything is so over-the-top that you either say to yourself, ""this is ridiculous,"" and walk out, or you say, ""this is ridiculous,"" and laugh at the ridiculousness of it all. The situational ridiculousness of it all is kind of like ""Sharknado,"" but ""The End"" is much funnier. A better comparison, perhaps, would be to ""The Interview,"" which features James Franco and Seth Rogen, two of the main actors in this film. <br/><br/>If you liked ""The Interview,"" you'll probably like this film as well.

"view_and_review","5","1","3","27 January 2015"," What the Devil?
","Before watching this movie I'd read many negative reviews. They all boiled down to the movie being a drug and sex laden farce. The reviews did prevent me from paying to see it, but they didn't prevent me from watching it for free.<br/><br/>The movie started off good enough. A host of actors play themselves in a movie about the apocalypse. There were a few very funny scenes. To be fair to the reviews I read, there were PLENTY of drug references and drug use. And there was plenty of sexual references and innuendos. It got a bit much when there was a two minute bit about Danny McBride's affinity with ejaculation and other aspects of it. It all got even worse with the sexualization of a demon and/or the devil. This is not to say that the devil deserves a noble or honorable representation, its just that I prefer not to see him naked and with male genitalia in various states. It was very disturbing. It's an image you can't unsee. <br/><br/>I'm not Christian but I could see how they'd be offended by this movie. Talk about trivializing a serious event or just completely misrepresenting it and Heaven. The movie went horribly wrong towards the end. I'd say 75% of the movie was solid just tone down the phallic references, drug usage and biblical ties."
"CowherPowerForever","5","1","3","27 May 2014"," Seth, that's some of the better acting than I've seen in your last six movies. Where was that in Green Hornet?
","So I decided after nearly a year to watch this film. My friends have been saying it is one of the better comedy films of recent times. Yeah, like normal, they were way off. This film is average, and crams most of its funny moments into a few spots. The ending, while it fits into the overall plot, is just boring and a waste of time.<br/><br/>The story while very simple is actually a nice concept. Sadly, the lame humor actors like Seth Rogen use these days in not my cup of tea. However if you love the overuse of penis jokes then this is right up your alley. Anyway, the story is simple, James Franco is having a big party at this LA mansion. Seth Rogen attend with this party with his from out of town friend Jay Baruchel. Jay Baruchel decides he doesn't want to be at the party anymore so he takes a walk down the street to a local convenient shop. Well, things start to get crazy now as people start to get sucked into these blue beams of light coming from the sky, and if you have any education at all then you know where the plot is going from here. The comedy while downright hilarious at times is overall weak and bland. I mentioned the penis jokes above and they really use them in this film, a little too much I would say. Danny McBride steals the show in my opinion. This is one of the funniest men to grace the big screen in a long time. Yet he can't make this film better than average.<br/><br/>Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen both directed this film, and while it is mostly an easy shot, there are come CG scenes in the film. They actually aren't done that badly, and you think they would be really cheesy since this is basically just a bigger than normal comedy. Not the case though. So in this department, a thumbs up for sure.<br/><br/>Overall if you enjoy new comedy films from Seth Rogen and those like him, then you should enjoy this film. As someone who is very worried about newer comedy films from guys like Rogen, this film fell below the good mark. Even with its downright hilarious moments at times, this is a rent or wait for your streaming service to carry it, as spending added money on this would be a huge waste.<br/><br/>5/10"
"noelcox","4","1","3","16 March 2014"," a good premise spoilt by crudity
","This is a good basic story - some actors (playing themselves) facing the apocalypse occurring while at a house-warming party - but spoilt, in my estimation, by excessive crudity. There are many and lengthy references to sexual acts, graphic phallic symbols, and references to rape, homosexual acts and other things that are totally inappropriate in a mainstream film. Otherwise, the story was actually quite good, and I enjoyed the film. It is a pity that it was spoilt for me by these distractions. The acting was also variable, and I suspect that several of the actors were a little embarrassed to be taking part in this film. I would have preferred to have had a better developed story, better special effects, and a more imaginative ending."

","I must admit that I expected to hate this movie, as I'm not a fan of most of the actors featured here. However, they did a really good job with the story, as it moved along nicely and had some decent twists and turns, never getting boring or static. My favorite part was when the Rapture first happened and the world went crazy. Seth and Jay are stumbling through the streets that are in full-scale panic, confusion, and destruction. They get back to Franco's house and absolutely nothing has changed at the party and no one has disappeared; they don't even realize anything has happened! LOL My problem with the film were the ""jokes"". I was prepared for the 1000's of uses of the ""F"" word throughout (lazy writing/ad-libbing), but the drug jokes got old fast.<br/><br/>Also, how many D**k jokes can a group of adults make in a 2 hour movie without it starting to get really weird? Answer, much fewer than were made in this film. If I was 11 years old, this movie would have seemed hilarious. At 15, it would have been really funny. As an adult, it got tedious.<br/><br/>Usually, when grown men talk about sex, they do so in reference to women, conquests, desires, lies, etc. These guys talked almost exclusively about their own equipment and what they do with it; nothing else. Again, something you commonly find among 11 year olds."

Basically it all comes down to being the Apocalypse and how each character eventually reacts to it. There are funny moments here and there but just a lot of silly dialogue. Danny McBride has't been funny since Tropic Thunder and he really gets annoying in this movie. Jonah Hill hasn't done anything good since Moneyball. In fact, his humor seems to repeat itself. I do believe you are to think he gets raped by Satan. In 21 Jump Street and The Watch he refers to giving oral sex to men. It's a bit nauseating and old hat. Seth Rogan was last funny in the 40 Year Old Virgin. It's almost like these guys are running out of good ideas. I like the use of the music by Black Sabbath in the movie since they are my favorite band. I don' t know what else to say about hence the 5 stars.

The reality of something like this happening is very real.

The plot of the movie was also outstanding, how they have more than one movie, in This Is The End I believe it extraordinary.<br/><br/>The most fascinating thing was the background music/sound, it was utterly phenomenal. The way they set up the tracks/songs to what was going on in the movie could not have been any better, if I may say so myself. The music was set up throughout the movie based on the events that were going on such as, the crackling of fire, the sounds of the demon animals walking around, the sound of the lights from heaven coming down, it was all around fantastic.<br/><br/>My overall reaction to the film was great, I loved this movie from start to finish.

One, they killed off all of the truly funny people (I won't say whom) at the beginning and we are left with yet another stoner/frat boy comedy starring Rogen + Franco. I'm not a Pineapple Express fan so I guess I was doomed from the start. Two, all of the jokes were the same: drugs, dick, rape, repeat.<br/><br/>There were, however, a few things about the film I loved. Michael Cera's scenes were hilarious + he only took up about 5 minutes of screen time. Jonah Hill's ""Rosemary's Baby"" moment was great (no one in my theater got the reference, though). And of course, the celebrity gimp cameo was genius. ""I love himmmm."" I'm still laughing.<br/><br/>Overall, I really need to stop going into these movies with any expectations because I'm always disappointed. I just don't understand how you can put all these ""funny"" people together + get such an unfunny movie. Nevermind, I saw ""Grown Ups"" with Adam Sandler + crew (can you believe that got a sequel?).<br/><br/>Anyway, I doubt I'll ever watch ""This Is The End"" again.

","Directed by Seth Rogen and Eva Goldberg, ""This Is The End"" stars various Hollywood actors as comical versions of themselves. The film then portrays Los Angeles as a cauldron of bad manners, vices and judgemental jerks. Seeking to put an end to this debauchery is nothing less than the Bible's Book of Revelations, whose prophecies ""come true"", resulting in all ""good people"" being ""sucked up into heaven"" whilst all ""bad people"" find themselves trapped on a planet Earth now awash with demons, beasts and fiery infernos.<br/><br/>At this point, ""This is the End"" becomes a parody of post-apocalyptic action movies. Cleverly, the film portrays our heroes working together and putting aside differences, but only on the surface. Behind smiles, they're all conspiring against one another. Our heroes then discover that they too can ""enter heaven"", if only they ""be good"", ""die for others"", ""sacrifice themselves"" and ""learn to unconditionally love their fellowmen"". Yes, this is a stoner comedy which, like David Gordon Green's recent ""The Sitter"", is preoccupied with ethics. It also advocates dying selflessly for others. Anti-Christians scoff, but the film was written by two Jews, and philosophers of every creed and race have been espousing the same for centuries.<br/><br/>""This is the End"" stars a funnier than usual Jonah Hill as an absurdly polite goof-ball and Danny McBride as Satan incarnate. James Franco, as usual, steals the show, playing himself as an overly sincere, drugged out playboy. The film climaxes with Whitney Houston's ""I Will Always Love You"", a song which succinctly sums up the film's message. <br/><br/>Whilst ""End"" has some funny moments, it's mostly inconsistent, too heavily improvised and its final sequences are not only awful (Backstreet Boys?) but contradict everything that came before (Heaven is just Hollywood painted white?). The film's best gags feature McBride and Franco attacking each other with invisible ejaculate, and Emma Watson eavesdropping on our heroes as they discuss how not to molest her. Plato would be proud. <br/><br/>7.5/10 – Worth one viewing."

","An average comedy, in the honoured tradition we have come to expect from all the Judd Appatow alumni! The movie is short on plot, as other have pointed out, but it does really contain some funny, funny highlights.<br/><br/>At times the movie lags somewhat, but it has enough good bits to make up for those moments. The cast, well it isn't really a cast since the actors play themselves (and with themselves) in the movie!!! I sincerely hope that these are just more exaggerated versions of their real selves, because boy, if these guys are like that in real life they would be quite insufferable.<br/><br/>There are some eye opening cameos that really contribute to this movie's surreal and weird vibe, but that is not necessarily bad. There is however one cameo in particular that works to great effect, besides being really f **king hilarious. I'll let you guess which one that is! You don't have to be part and parcel of the Appatow universe to get this movie, but if you are you will understand some of the references made during the movie better and perhaps some of the ""in"" jokes the cast pokes at itself.<br/><br/>I think that with this flick Seth Rogen and his buddies have come to the realization that this sub-genre of male angst/insecurity driven comedy has run its course, and that they themselves, as it is acknowledged in the movie, have grown and changed beyond the personas they have portrayed in their other movies. It is time to move on! <br/><br/>But in the meantime, there is no reason not to go out with a bang! So if you want to see what the end of the world would look like in Hollywood(and who gets to go to heaven and hell), the largest penis ever put on screen and Michael Cera as you've never seen him before, well then this is the movie for you! <br/><br/>IF you are going to end something, might as well do it in style!"
"rgblakey","8","3","18","12 June 2013"," Prepare for the apocalypse like you have never seen it in This is the End
","For years Seth Rogen has been entertaining audiences with his average guy persona, love of weed and unique laugh. It has become a pretty standard assumption that when most of his films come out there is a good chance that some familiar faces are coming along for the ride. As of late he has been veering away from the stoner comedies and establishing himself in some more mainstream roles showcasing more range. Now he is stepping behind the camera as well along with long time writing partner Evan Goldberg for their latest film This Is The End, but will it deliver as good as the trailer promises? <br/><br/>This Is The End follows famous friends Seth Rogen, Jay Baruchel, James Franco, Jonah Hill, Danny McBride, and Craig Robinson that are trapped in Franco's house during a party when the coming apocalypse rains down on the world. The story here is pretty simple and one that could have easily crashed and burned quickly, but thanks to the well written script, great chemistry, and overall fun this ended up being one of the funniest comedies to come along in some time. Goldberg and Rogen have taken two difficult concepts and meshed them together to create on those films that is not only a lot of fun, but seems to get even funnier with each viewing. When actors play themselves they tend to want to take the moment to show the world who they really are, but here they amped things up to create over embellished version of themselves and never take themselves seriously with some going so far out of left field of what fans are used to seeing that they steal the show. The real scene stealer comes from Michael Cera who isn't in the film all that long, but is a laugh riot with his out of character performance. Every one of these guys does a great job and has such awesome chemistry that at times you almost forget you are watching a movie that is until the end of the world begins. This is two kinds of films rolled into one brilliant raunchy ride. The first half is just a bunch of celebrities hanging, but with a subtle focus on the friendship between Rogen and Baruchel. This in turn leads to the issues between them and the others in Rogen's life. This aspect of the story continues throughout the film but is made more subtle as the apocalypse begins which in turn cranks the fun up. There are a lot of visual effects here and for a film of this kind you wouldn't expect all that much, but clearly they went all in and created some really cool visuals that just help the movie that much more. Rogen always has great music in his films and this film is no different, but more so as the music is so out of left field at times, but placed so perfectly that it takes it to another level.<br/><br/>Rogen and Goldberg have already established themselves as writers in Hollywood, but here they have stepped it up and showed their abilities as directors as well and delivered a piece of comedic genius. The trailers show a lot of cameos, but there are still plenty of surprises that you won't see coming and will leave you wanting more. It's not every day you can say a comedy has to be seen on the big screen, but there are some aspects that scream for it and they deliver. Some of these guys humor is an acquired taste but there is no doubt that this film delivers on every level making it the funniest film of this year and one that is sure to live long past the apocalypse."
"cal1946","8","3","19","13 June 2013"," Hysterical
","I laughed loud and long. This movie is rude, crude, lewd, stupid and very funny. It makes fun of practically everything, nothing is sacred. They made fun of each other, themselves, movies, theirs and others, had the most improbable conversations, the most surprising situations, caught me off guard more than once. When one of the characters came bursting through a window, I screamed, causing double the laughter from the person with whom I was sitting, both at the movie and at me. The finale was really fun, again, so silly I just had to laugh. Do not look for common sense or intelligence from this movie, just watch it to have a rousing laugh fest. I also enjoyed Emma's contribution, it was fun seeing her in a non Hermione role, though I loved her as Hermione."

","I fall into the demography of female, 54 years of age and should have hated this movie according to the survey, but I laughed out loud several times (rare for a movie) and enjoyed it. My 24 year old son and 20 year old daughter thought it was funny as well. My husband, though, was not amused. If you forgot how to be young or what you were like in your 20's this movie is not for you but if you do and can appreciate a good laugh here and there, go see it..It can be long on masturbation jokes but it would something 6 guys stuck together in a house would think and talk about facing the end of days, among other things. I like the premise of the actors playing themselves (different and amusing). I also liked the underlying story of friendship and redemption."
"plasticanimalz","9","3","21","13 June 2013"," One of the Funniest Movies Ever
","I usually don't find that much at the movies worth laughing at these days due to weak plots, weak scripts, and over used jokes. I've seen all of the Judd Apatow and Seth Rogen films and some I find entertaining and others I find disappointing. This, however, was hilarious. I went to a 5:15 screening on opening day and had to buy tickets in advance 'cause it was going to sell out, which it did. Meaning, everyone cut out of work early or were unemployed, and had to see this movie. I was afraid that all the funny things would be in the previews or that the trailer would sell it as really funny but then it wouldn't be, but, it was as funny as I had hoped...though, it was not an alien movie, which is what I thought, but that's fine. The only other movie I've laughed as much in the past 10 years has been 'Bridesmaids,' and probably the only thing other than that is 'Airplane,' which I've see at least 10 times.<br/><br/>I really feel I need to watch this movie again because it's non-stop jokes, and so I feel I need another viewing to get more out of this movie. Another thing is the movie is totally original. The only thing I could remotely say it resembles is 'Ghostbusters,' though, this story is very different. The performances were all great. I spent the majority of my 20s hanging out with celebrities and going to their house parties, and so if you were ever wondering what they're like, this movie was spot-on. Michael Cera playing the obnoxious, pervy actor, Jonah Hill playing the possibly gay, somewhat femme actor, the over the top bro love from James Franco towards Seth. They pretty much played out what actors probably would do in case of an apocalypse.<br/><br/>I don't even want to go into the lines from this movie and what happens and spoil it for anyone, but the whole crowd at the theater was laughing the whole time, having a good time, and my friend and I were quoting the movie and recounting the funny scenes throughout the rest of the night.<br/><br/>I read a few comments saying it was all potty humor and sexual gratuity and drugs? It was very low, especially considering what is normally in these guys films. And, why would you see one of their films if you're easily offended? This film was actually pretty tame and low on the offensive scale compared to a lot of what is out there today. I almost feel like the people that gave it the bad reviews either went in their with the intention of not liking it, for whatever weird, psycho reason that is, or realized, like me, that it was not aliens and it was a biblical apocalypse, and got offended that that kind of humor and the bible were in the same movie. Again, why would you see a Seth Rogen, Jonah Hill movie if you're easily offended? Oh, and the people who thought this was dumb and humorless I bet you they love shows like 'Everybody Loves Raymond' and 'Mad About You,' shows that are generally popular but pc and void of flavor or humor.<br/><br/>This was extremely funny, very well written, and I absolutely loved it. I don't even have any complaints 'cause I got absolutely everything I wanted from it and more."
"Michael_Elliott","Null","3","21","13 June 2013"," Brave, Original and Downright Hilarious
","This Is the End (2013) <br/><br/>*** 1/2 (out of 4) <br/><br/>Seth Rogan, Jonah Hill, Jay Baruchel, Danny McBride and Craig Robinson are at James Franco's house partying when something disastrous happens and the men soon find themselves facing all sorts of danger as they tucker into the house and try to survive. To mention exactly what happened would be a mistake for anyone going into this film blind. Yes, the trailers hint at a few things but there's just so many off-the-wall twists in this film that it would be a shame for anyone to have them spoiled. I will say that this here is without question one of the most original, daring and funny comedies to come out of Hollywood in years. Co-writer and co-directors Rogan and Evan Goldberg actually do an incredibly good job on both fronts for a number of reasons. For starters, they're really not worried about crossing the line of good taste but their dirty humor isn't like so many other gross-out films where it happens just for the sake doing something dirty. The humor here comes for a reason and the reason is whatever situation the cast finds themselves in. Again, I'm not going to ruin these situations but once you see the film you'll know exactly what I'm talking about. There's a lot of great humor aimed at weed and various other drugs, which also come off as fresh and original even if that REEFER MADNESS thing has been done to death since Cheech and Chong came along. The film also has something to say about certain issues, which are smartly placed in the screenplay where they don't come off as being preachy. Finally, a big amount of credit has to go to the cast members for allowing themselves to be the jokes of so many cruel moments. This is especially true of the five survivors who must deal with each other through this ordeal and the screenplay is just so creative that it perfectly nails this stars even if they are just playing certain versions of themselves. Not only do we get the big five doing their thing but a lot of other celebrities show up with quick cameos and it's good that they can all laugh at themselves. THIS IS THE END is a brave little gem that manages to be incredibly funny at times but best of all is that the viewer never knows where it's going to go next."

","I did not go into this movie expecting much, but I was left with even less than I was expecting.<br/><br/>The actors are great, of course, but to put them into a movie like this, where they must survive a devastating apocalypse, it surprisingly just gets boring. They must have had great ideas for the first ten minutes of the script and then ran out for the rest. Most of the film is spent with the characters talking in rooms, much of it without any laughs at all. Although there are some pretty clever and ridiculous moments, they are not funny enough to laugh out loud at.<br/><br/>Seth Rogen, Jay Baruchel and many other comedy/stoner comedy stars are great to see giving it their best performance, but the production and script itself are what I feel need improvement.<br/><br/>If I could compare the overall entertainment I received of This Is The End to any films, it would be just slightly better than Your Highness with Seth Rogen and as good as The Sitter with Jonah Hill.

"TomShortell","7","1","4","26 January 2014"," Satisfying as it could be
","There are not many elements for this film to be significant to others because its basic instinct is to show the audience what they can do with an end of the world idea. I think action wise, it was pretty awful as I thought, spending this much money it could of been done a fair bit better because it seemed stupid in ways. <br/><br/>The comedic side towards this film absolutely sold it to me. It was just full of actors that I adore. Seth Rogan and Jay Baruchel play both main characters and I did enjoy their whole storyline and backdrop. The party scene was by far my favourite. The comedy was just brilliant. Michael Cera usually annoys me but in this he did provide me with a lot of laughs. <br/><br/>The film didn't absolutely annihilate the audiences expectations with the action however with the actors that are chosen they really suit the film and this type of comedy. I think if the majority of these were not chosen I would not of enjoyed the movie as I did.

How you going to heaven and you don't even believe in God and isn't half of the cast if not all members of the Jewish faith if I'm not mistaken?

","At first it's amusing to watch these various actors and celebrities have fun with their persona's and public image, but it quickly snowballs into a series of self-indulgent skits and inside jokes before finally running out of steam by the third act. How funny you find these shenanigans will ultimately depend greatly on your affinity for the main cast. If you didn't like Seth Rogen playing Dale Denton in 'The Pineapple Express', then chances are you won't like Seth Rogen playing Seth Rogen either.<br/><br/>This isn't the kind of film that will hold up well upon repeat viewing, but as a one-off time waster it offers up just enough laughs to be worthwhile."
"hkauteur","7","1","4","14 October 2013"," HK Auteur Review - This Is The End
","First off, I want to say I am a fan of the Judd Apatow team. Before Judd Apatow made The 40 Year Old Virgin and Knocked Up, I wasn't really into the American comedies that were dominated by Ben Stiller, Will Ferrel and Vince Vaughn. The improvisational nature of Apatow's comedy and the crude sophomoric jokes infused with a heartfelt message hit me on a deeper level. As a lover of buddy cop movies, I'm also generally a sucker for bromance movies, of which I would argue is a close relative. Most of all, I like Apatow's cast of actors. Seth Rogen, Jonah Hill, Danny McBride, Michael Cera, James Franco... they're all funny in their own idiosyncratic way and seem to have free reign over their own personas.<br/><br/>This brings me to my first critique of This is the End. The central gag of having the actors play themselves isn't as funny as the film thinks it is. For example, This is the End's version of Michael Cera is a foul-mouthed cocaine addict. Why? Because the filmmakers thought it'd be funny to do a total reversal on Cera's real life persona. That gag is only truly funny if we know what Michael Cera is like in real life. Most of us, unlike the filmmakers, can only drawn upon Michael Cera's timid on screen persona. That creates enough of a contrast to elicit laughs and it does. However, the filmmakers are ultimately more connected to the joke than the audience can ever be, and that is problematic on some level. I get the feeling I should be laughing harder than the film is making me.<br/><br/>Just to reiterate, I did laugh. There were times when the celebrity gag won me over. I liked how the character relationships were set up and they all have great chemistry. Jay Baruchel plays the audience's avatar and reacts to all colors of obnoxious behavior exhibited by the other actors. Actually, the film even takes it one comedic step further. When Danny McBride enters the film, he does his brand of obnoxious behavior that happens to be so overwhelming, the other annoying actors call him on it and ask him to stop.<br/><br/>When the film doesn't rely on the celebrity gag and gives something for the characters to do to survive the Apocalypse, it's much more creative and funnier. I liked the graphic novel-like style that went into the world creation of the apocalypse. Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg deliver some surprises to what's going on outside James Franco's house. The parts in between that didn't pertain to surviving the Apocalypse are strung by improvisational dialogue scenes and they stick out as the weaker moments. I recognize the ability to improvise scenes and be funny on camera, but watching the cast react to the fantastical elements was more interesting than watching the celebrities react to each other. As the audience's avatar, Jay Baruchel ends up being outnumbered as he is the only genuine likable character in a cast of six. So for somebody isn't already warm to these actors, they easily come off as very unlikable. And that can get taxing rather quickly. The writing isn't doing enough to build enough character for the cast and the film is completely reliant on what we know of these actors and their past works.<br/><br/>Due to its leaning towards it's own self-referential quality than being a apocalyptic survival film, This is the End is ultimately a fan film for the Judd Apatow audience. (Think Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back for Kevin Smith's Viewaskew Universe) If you never liked any of the comedies from the Judd Apatow team, this movie isn't going to convert you. If you don't like none of these actors, I'd tell you to just skip it altogether. I am part of the Apatow audience and like these actors, and even with that, it felt like watching one gigantic inside joke."
"joshmceachern","6","1","4","15 October 2013"," Spreads a Misunderstood Notion
","My problem with this movie other than the vulgarity was the surprising but flawed theme(not reflected in score). Many will say its just a comedy movie, however, there is a disturbingly popular misconception. Christianity is different from every other faith and religion itself because it is not about what you do, but what has been done for you. It is the acknowledgment that eternal life is not achievable through man who is naturally sinful. When one truly understands and accepts this it creates a change in the heart that leads to ""good"" deeds. However, God calls even our righteous acts ""filthy rags"". Also, the assumption that only ""good"" people go to Heaven leaves no hope for people that have done wrong, which we all have. So while many will say I'm being too serious, I don't think you can be serious enough about eternity."

The movie had too much of a religious background and it was all condensed into the very end of the movie. They could have made the movie a lot better if they would have kept the movie going as the beginning had started. The beginning was the best part of the movie and then they tried to tie in too much of a story about saving yourself and everything towards the end. Also, they made it seem as if you can do one thing and then be saved.

","This is the End is a film for a smaller niche of film-goers, people familiar with the work of Judd Apatow's troupe good and bad. Many of the jokes will fly right past anyone not well associated with their previous films. Mind you, you don't have to had liked any of these films necessarily as the film is often hilariously critical or slighted towards all their careers. What this film is is simply a celebration. The film wastes no time with story but remains competent enough to be interesting. Rather than using any personal religious beliefs the film harnesses a very traditional Christian apocalypse for the sake of simplicity and approachability. As a whole, This is The End is a film right with humility, never afraid to poke fun at any of the great staring cast. It is often crude, as many of their careers have been, it's rife with drugs and alcohol, but at the end of the day it's making fun of their lifestyle and their often foolish world views. The film is a celebration of comedy and American film culture, Hollywood and the world around it. It's never afraid to be riddled with in jokes and if the viewer ever feels isolated they're almost always greeted with another gag moments later. Most of these actors have had about ten years or so in the limelight, many finding major success in the last few years. The film is a retrospective of gross out and absurdity and with an open mind most viewers should find at least a handful of good jokes. The film stands for everything fun and equally stupid about Saturday night parties for better or worse, but always for the sake of comedy."

The actors do a wonderful job, dragging us into their perfect universe until it breaks down.<br/><br/>The story is not original, however the manner of telling it is new, fresh, entertaining, unique, and extremely funny.<br/><br/>Moreover, I believe that besides the comedic facade of the movie, there's a pretty important message there. Throughout the film there's a constant friction going on between atheists and believers and in the ends, as it turns out, the second group was right all along..there is a God, and a heaven, and the saints.<br/><br/>'This is the End' makes you laugh like crazy but at the end, it makes you wonder and it gives you hope. I think that behind the amusement, the jokes, the cursing and the fighting there's a very important message: Guys, be nice, you will really go to Heaven. Heaven which in this movie is portrayed as a gigantic all-white party, with girls wearing bikinis and everyone smoking pot.<br/><br/>I believe also it's a movie about faith too. Faith that if you do good, the universe will reward you. If you are nice, you have a chance at redemption.<br/><br/>I enjoyed it very much but it also made me think about the 'afterlife'. If people knew for sure that Heaven exists and it's a full-blown party, where all your wishes come true, would they be good Christians every day? Would they sacrifice this life in order to get a VIP invitation the biggest, coolest party, the one that goes on forever? We can never know, but what's for sure, this movie rocks! I highly recommend it!"
"christophe92300","6","1","4","22 September 2013"," Lacked ambition
","This Is The End was certainly the most anticipated comedy of the year, and if the movie is rather enjoyable, it also disappoints a bit. The pleasure it gives revolves mainly around the crazy atmosphere prevailing within this large group of actors and the delicious dialogues that form sometimes very funny scenes. Unfortunately, the problem lies in the plot, because with such a promising premise, one could have expected something a lot more refined and a lot less confined than this unexpected behind closed doors trip at James Franco's. The linearity of the story and the final outcome, a bit sloppy, just emphasizes the relative disappointment. This lack of ambition is unfortunate because ultimately the movie turns out to be pretty entertaining."
"e-pappalettera","6","1","4","15 September 2013"," freewheeling craziness
","It is a film so stupid that makes you doubt that it is clever ( ?) The question remains of how everything is intended or unintended . Certainly the idea is original and intelligent to interpret the role of the actors themselves, that is a group of Hollywood actors involved to get high as they could at a party super- kitsch , when the apocalypse comes . The two authors Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg , along with Judd Apalow , carry on for some years a type of teen comedy - demented , which is added in this case a portion of the John Belushi's catastrofism. The great Belushi had , however , for his neurotic character , a note of self- irony here is much less noticeable . There is a total identification being spoiled , selfish , superficial . The childishness irremediable , the actors - characters put out in front of the drama of the end of the world , it is absolutely convincing enough to make me think if by chance they are not really so or this is rather an indication of directors are directors or to be childish ( complication : Seth Rogen is both an actor and director), the fact is that throughout the movie I had no doubt that these people are more or less so in reality. Doubt reinforced by the fact that Emma Watson ( Hermione Henry Potter ) is also present in the role of herself and instead has a behavior quite ""normal"" for the situation , quite different from the others, that look like real idiots . Having created this effect of ambiguity seems to me already an extraordinary result ( pure craziness : the artist - not the zany character - seems insane without being one ) , only that it would be worthwhile to see the movie . For a good chunk of the movie you do not know what will happen , and so far its ramshackle vulgarity is tolerable , with moments of comedy in my opinion failed. Then when the voltage has to find a solution, the story slips into banality. The finish is so obvious and silly as to be almost irrelevant. An experiment challenging but ends in a caricatured ."
"keithl11","5","1","4","14 September 2013"," Really funny and good followed by too silly and not so good!
","I can't remember a time when I got really excited to see a movie, then got into it, and was even more into it than I'd hope, then almost completely lost interest! First, ""This is the End"" is a weird movie. But that's OK. It's a comedy starring a bunch of people who have been known to do some unconventional humor from time to time. Sometimes their movies are good, sometimes bad, sometimes just so, so. What was unique about this was that I was told ahead of time that it was good. Having just watched the trailer, with no reviews given, or word of mouth--I gotta say...there's no way I'd go to see this. But, after hearing it was good, then hearing it again, I finally decided to watch it. It starts off great. (Thankyou internet! You never let me down...not so fast!) My joy has a half life and it fittingly makes it to about the halfway mark of the movie. It's at that point when things start to get a little too silly. Yes!--I know this is a movie about a bunch of stoner stars experiencing the apocalyspe together. I know this! So I should be at least a bit forgiving when it comes to silliness and things that just don't make sense, but the problem with the silliness is seems like sort of an inside joke that the friends who made this movie are enjoying while the rest of us just smile and try to fake a laugh! Rent it if you like. It shouldn't be long now. But, if you're on the fence about dishing out the 11 or 12 bucks to see this in a theatre...hold onto the money or try and find something better! Not a terrible movie, but certainly NOT what a lot of people made it out to be,"
"nbrimmerbeller","6","1","4","14 July 2013"," Oh it's funny. But it's not great.
","I would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy myself watching this movie. It's pretty hilarious at times, and in a few parts quite well written/ad-libbed. But this only lasts for about half the movie. Once the cabin fever starts really heating up, the movie takes a turn that is far too strange and unneeded for it to be funny, or for it to work. It becomes a big mess of good one-liners and shocks, but no real substance or wit any more. There are a few excellent sequences, like Franco's almost-ascension, and a cameo from a brilliantly surprising actor as a gimp, but really the film totally lost its magic for the last half-hour at least. Much of the movie, regardless of its sometimes unnecessary absurdity, is like watching a video put together by a group of great friends, who you don't know at all. Much of the charm comes from the group's in-jokes, which are funny when they appear in films like Knocked Up, Funny People, etc (most Apatow movies), but they fall flat and get irritating in a two-hour-long movie. They're a great group of comedians, who can deliver some good laughs. But without structure, without real substance, they just can't pull together a whole movie. It's funny, it's somewhat entertaining, but overall it is severely disappointing."
"soymaid327","6","1","4","10 July 2013"," Well-written mix of highbrow, lowbrow, meta and absurdist comedy
","I found Superbad to be very uneven, and its characters irritatingly unsympathetic. Which is why I was so pleasantly surprised to see in this movie a consistent level of self-aware comedy and believable (comedic) emotional development which naturally advanced with the plot. The movie features a slew of actors playing against type, with many tongue-in-cheek nods to their real-life personas and their conceptions in pop culture -- James Franco is pretentious, Danny McBride abrasive and self-centered, Jonah Hill meek and accommodating, Emma Watson reimagined as a fierce survivalist, and of course Michael Cera in a brief but memorable performance that hearkens back to Neil Patrick Harris's cameo in Harold & Kumar. Craig Robinson seems to have also finally hit on a dynamic character who is interesting to watch on screen, and he is one of the best parts of the movie. Indeed, though I felt little love for the bickering idiots in Superbad, the bickering idiots of This Is The End are ultimately sympathetic, which is essential to the tone of the movie.<br/><br/>There are jokes that didn't work for me, including far too many genitalia jokes and a tasteless men-being-raped-is-funny moment. The movie also goes at least fifteen minutes too long, lingering in the second act when I was restless for the third. But the topical references seem only more hilarious given how badly they will age (Gangnam Style and Backstreet Boys being notable examples) and quotable lines are nearly endless; I feel destined to rewatch this movie and enjoy new jokes each time."

","If you're looking for a movie that will inspire you, or a film that initiates new thoughts and feelings, and is for definite the next Oscar winner for Best Picture, you have come to the wrong movie. This is the End is what you would call 'light watching'. It is named a comedy, because it is a comedy, and delivers gags and laughs in abundance. <br/><br/>Set in the current time, it is almost a parody movie of the biblical apocalypse. But the underlying theme that the movie keeps reverting back to, is no matter how famous or rich you are, when there is an apocalypse, only those who are worthy and good will survive. The laughs centered almost entirely on penis jokes. And yes, most of them were hilarious. But you most certainly would not bring your in laws or grandparents along to this picture, as there would be very little to say on the car ride home!<br/><br/>Set with an all star cast, it was very entertaining to see the assumed characters of the celebrities we love/hate and read about every day. Michael Cera being easily the most unlikely and snigger-worthy of them all. <br/><br/>A pretty stupid movie in summary, but if you're looking for an easy laugh, or you're feeling blue, reluctantly pay the overpriced tickets for this, because you'll almost certainly cheer up by the time the credits roll."

","Let's call this the Rogan/Goldberg ""homage"" to DOGMA. I think the only thing that could have made it better would have been Jay & Silent Bob coming to save the day with the heavenly host and a chariot-load of weed. Anyway, I'm not a young guy and I have not seen half the flicks this crew has been in but I got to the Multiplex Friday too late to catch ""Iron Man 3"" or ""Man of Steel"" and my wife chose this one over ""The Purge"". Well thank heavens for that because we both laughed our asses off and had a great time. The insane premise worked and one hilarious scene after another followed. Not to ruin it, but a couple of moments were just great. Michael Cera is over the top as a coked out, egotistical sex fiend version of himself. Jay Baruchel using lines from The Exorcist to banish a demon from Jonah Hill was hysterical. So many severely dark, funny moments that I will have to rent this one and watch it again and again. By the way, the effects definitely did make this a big screen thumbs up. And my wife LOVED the musical ending. She had it pegged at the first 5 notes and was doing all the moves. Yet another little homage to Kevin Smith. Not quite as funky as Morris Day and the Time but still pretty slick. I put this right up there with some of my favorite comedy flicks."

","Turns out Hollywood is quite talented – as long as the actors are allowed to play themselves. Jay Baruchel (She's out of My League) has flown into L.A. to visit his good, also Canadian, friend Seth Rogen (Knocked Up). They eat greasy cheeseburgers, get high and rock out to Backstreet Boys. Seth decides they should swing by a party at James Franco's house (Oz the Great and Powerful). During the party the apocalypse happens. What happens for the next 1 ½ hours is the most hilarious moments in each of these actors' careers.<br/><br/>What Works – All the actors are flat out funny and they die in the Hollywood hierarchy as they should with A-listers like James Franco and Jonah Hill making it to the end while Michael Cera and Rihanna aren't so lucky.<br/><br/>What Doesn't Work – There are a lot of cock shots, so it's best to cover the kid's eyes if you aren't interested in exposing them to giant-sized, demon genitals.<br/><br/>What I Thought – This is what summer is all about – hanging out with your friends and partying until the world ends.

"jboothmillard","8","2","15","7 July 2013"," This Is the End
","I saw some short clips from this upcoming film, and obviously I was attracted by its many great names in the cast, but I don't think I realised they were all playing mock versions of themselves, so I was really looking forward to it. Basically in Los Angeles, actor Jay Baruchel is joining friend and fellow actor Seth Rogen (also writing and directing) at a housewarming party hosted by James Franco, with many other celebrity guests attending to dabble in alcohol, drugs, sex and other immoral acts. With so many stars, like Jonah Hill, Craig Robinson, Michael Cera, Emma Watson, Rihanna, Jason Segel, Paul Rudd, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Mindy Kaling, David Krumholtz, Kevin Hart and Aziz Ansari, Baruchel feels uncomfortable. He and Rogen leave for a moment to get some cigarettes from the store, and all of the sudden what seems like an earthquake wrecks the place, and beams of blue light shoot down from the sky and take people away, but when they return to Franco's house there is no sign of any destruction. Moments later however the party evacuates when they do have an earthquake, the Hollywood hills are on fire, explosions and crashes cause chaos, and the ground opens up with fire, with many celebrities falling into the fiery abyss below, it is the biggest natural disaster to strike California. Survivors Rogen, Baruchel, Franco, Hill and Robinson stay in the safety of Franco's house, boarding up the doors and windows, knowing that they are famous actors they believe that they be rescued very soon, but until then they try to make whatever food and drink they have last as long as possible, as well as having drugs and a gun ready to use. A night passes and Danny McBride appears, he had gatecrashed the party, he is unaware of the disaster happening and wastes supplies, he does not believe in any devastation, until a man appears through a crack in the wall and is decapitated in front of them. Still waiting for help they pass the time making a cheap home camera sequel to 2008 film Pineapple Express, which most of them appeared, but of course tensions rise between them, including about Rogen and Baruchel's friendship being estranged, and Baruchel's theory reading the Book of Revelation in the Bible that what is happening is the Apocalypse. They are soon joined by Emma Watson who had been hiding elsewhere outside, she is allowed to stay, but the group argue about finding her attractive, and the word ""rape"" is mentioned in the conversation, and confusion makes her threaten them to take all their drinks and she runs out. Franco remembers there is a storage of water coolers in the cellar, Robinson draws the short straw to go outside and try to get into it, but a something monstrous scares him back inside, but then Franco realises the cellar is right under their feet, so using whatever they have to get to it, and they manage it. McBride's behaviour as time passes have become more and more agitated, with much of what they have being lost because of him, so he is evicted by the group, he tries to kill them using the gun, but it is a prop, and angry he leaves. Robinson is the first to believe the Apocalypse theory, and they come to the conclusion that the blue beams of light are the Rapture, they are taking people to Heaven for doing good, and with Baruchel they explore the house next door for supplies, and secretly Hill wishes Baruchel to die. Hill with this sinful prayer is raped by an incubus, and becomes possessed with supernatural strength, he chases Rogen and Franco, while the two outside run from a demonic bull, and on return they all tie Hill down to perform an exorcism, until a fire occurs, setting the house and Hill on fire, forcing them all outside. Robinson regrets his mistakes life and sacrifices himself to the giant winged demon coming for them so the others can escape, and this succeeds as he is unexpectedly taken by the Rapture to Heaven, this gives the group hope that if they find their inner good they will be taken too. They are captured on their journey to find safety by a group of cannibals, led by McBride, who has Channing Tatum as his sex slave, Franco similarly sacrifices himself for the others, he does get the beam of light appear, but his cockiness at going to Heaven causes it to disappear, and the cannibals eat him alive. The gigantic demon with a fiery large penis comes to consume Rogen and Baruchel, awaiting death they reconcile their friendship, all the sudden a blue light starts taking Baruchel, he tries to pull Rogen up with him, but Rogen lets go to fall into the mouth of the monster, but the Rapture takes him too, and the demon is defeated. Rogen and Baruchel are welcomed into Heaven by Robinson who is now an angel with a halo above his head, he explains that being in Heaven is paradise and they can have anything they wish, so while Rogen gets a Segway the film ends Baruchel wishing for the reunion of the Backstreet Boys (Nick Carter, Howie Dorough, Brian Littrell, A.J. McLean and Kevin Scott Richardson) singing ""Everybody (Backstreet's Back)"" for a heavenly party. Also starring Martin Starr and Evan Goldberg (also writing and directing). The stars all send themselves up really well, the story is a funny and interesting way to satirise narcissism of Tinseltown, filled with spoofs and references of Rosemary's Baby, The Exorcist and reality show video diaries, and of course the slapstick and over the top jokes work great, the Backstreet Boys is a highlight, it is a most enjoyable apocalyptic comedy. Very good!"

","The end of the world with celebrities with the usual kind of forced Seth Rogan humor feels so tacky now, it all rode on the assumption of their appeal which was always questionable, but with time the obviousness of their manufactured fame is too much and the comedy simply doesn't work.
Its that kind of film they claim they had so much fun making it, as if it didn't matter that you don't have any fun watching it. Its like they got high one night and thought ""wouldn't it be cool if hermione had an axe"", and didn't have any idea what to do after that."

"ocward","7","1","5","7 November 2015"," Something Fresh I Think We All Needed
","It's the kind of movie you into either thinking it will be different because movies so often shy away from rather dark titles, or know it will be different because you know the comdedic artists behind the movie and how solid their earlier work is. It takes off like a jet, taking a minute to get going, accelerating to a good roar, then really kicking in the afterburners. You can really feel the inspiration throughout most of the movie, only really slowing down from the steady whirr near the end, which can honestly be attributed to the nature of the movie's plot. I can't say I would have done it any other way, but artsts are artists for a reason, so it does leave a feeling of an unfinished movie.<br/><br/>Now, even though I would not recommend most 7/10 movies because I'm so picky, this is one of those movies that can comfortably get by with a little bit of stagnation because of how relatable the characters are. You simply can't help but feel a lot of the same panic of the more knowledgeable character in the movie, or the general fear and hopelessness of the other characters. It's one of those movies I wouldn't watch over and over, but i'm glad I saw it."

A lot of people find James Franco irritating, though not me personally. I have to say, Franco played straight into that impression and was perfectly irritating in the most enjoyable way. Lots and lots of great cameos, some of whom I was sad to see go, particularly Aziz Ansari and Channing Tatum was perfect just the way millions of women would love to have him...a sex slave.

To me I get a kick how they show men talking about sex and the size of their manhood, when in reality it does happen. You get a bunch of young guys getting drunk and getting high in a comfortable atmosphere, well anything can happen. Seeing Danny McBride coming out of the bath tub the next morning was priceless.

It is dark, could even be regarded as blasphemous and the acting is so over the top, it could be seen as brilliant by some and excruciating by others.

The Line O Rama on the special features is a must, after watching that you can even see Seth Rogan chuckling in the final cut. 10/10 funniest film ever and I am a big film fanatic. It makes it so original as every actor plays themselves and they refer to past films and performances. People who rate this poorly are geeks and have little sense of humor and like I said, watched it once and missed a lot of the lines. Probably just seen the action parts and couldn't even repeat one word that was said. Also read a review of someone calling a main character Noah? I take it he/she meant Jonah Hill. Also they had no thought to why he was raped by Satan? Not even Satan it was a demon. Satan was the one with the 7 heads as previously stated by Jay earlier in the film and was later seen in the film. Anyway he was raped due to the fact he prayed death upon someone anyway like I said this film has been rated poorly due to geeks watching the film once and not even paying attention and then writing a review.

","Last night I viewed the raunchy action comedy, This Is the End, written and directed by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg. For a comedy, it has a high rating on IMDb, and that only further fuelled my interest. At first, one might think, ""Oh, another Seth Rogen-and-all-his -friends comedy."" This film is more unique than his others, and has a lot more than pot smoking and the widely annoying Rogen ""Huhhuhhuh"" laugh. The apocalypse is happening while they work to conserve limited resources inside James Franco's house. This plot, combined with a lot of comedy, is a cool idea. All of the main actors go by their real names, giving the film a reality feel.<br/><br/>I want to say right away, that I let out a lot of laughs while watching this, and I'm not sure what rating I'd give it, but it will be a high one. I'll mention some scenes I've laughed at in a bit.<br/><br/>It begins with Rogen meeting Baruchel at a California airport, then heading back to Rogen's place while Rogen starts a conversation about his gluten free diet. A lot of comedy here, making fun of the gluten free fad a lot of people are on, even though most don't even know what gluten is. ""Calories, that's a gluten; Fat, that's a gluten"" Rogen confidently says, showing the comedic ignorance.<br/><br/>They get high at Rogen's place, then a headline, ""Sinkhole in Guatemala"" is briefly shown on Rogen's new 3D TV, foreshadowing what is to come. Rogen mentions going to a party at Franco's new house, and Baruchel reluctantly agrees to go.<br/><br/>There are a lot of funny scenes at the party before all of Franco's party goers feel the brunt of the apocalypse.<br/><br/>Michael Cera does a great job playing a coked out, on drugs actor. He goes up to Christopher Mintz-Plasse, and they have a friendly how's-it-going'. Then Cera blows a large amount of cocaine in Mintz-Plasse's face. ""Shit Michael! I've never f**king done cocaine dude."" Then he goes into a panic, worrying how he will react to the drug. Cera assures him that he will walk him through it.<br/><br/>Jason Baruchel walks in on Michael Cera and two women. It looks like Cera is getting a rim job and a blow job by the two women. Unfazed, and sipping from a juice pack, he says, ""Hey Jay, you need to use the toilet, honey? Go ahead.""<br/><br/>While playing a game of pool, Cera slaps Rihanna's ass. Angered, she slaps his face.<br/><br/>Great comedy from Cera. Not a main character in the film, but he really adds to it. I'm still laughing at the cocaine in Mintz-Plasse's face scene. I often think of Mintz-Plasse as Fogell from Superbad.<br/><br/>Baruchel and Rogen go to a convenience store and what appears to be an earthquake takes place. Beams of blue light shine down from the sky, lifting people through the beam, up and away. Scared out of their minds and wondering if they're hallucinating, they hurry back to Franco's house. Nobody at the house knows what the panic stricken Baruchel is talking about. ""This place is a f**kin' fortress,"" Franco boasts. Baruchel tells Franco about people getting sucked into the sky. ""Nobody got sucked up here,"" Franco says. A coked out Michael Cera proudly announces, ""I got sucked off here,"" while raising his hand and waiting for a high five from the seemingly disgusted woman standing next to him.<br/><br/>The ground begins to separate, the party goers run outside, many falling into what looks like a bottomless pit. One character – I won't say who – gets impaled by a light post. There are other gory scenes, one involving a severed head being kicked around inside the house. Eventually it's just Franco, Rogen, Baruchel, Jonah Hill, Craig Robinson and Danny McBride taking refuge inside the house.<br/><br/>Emma Watson – who was at the party earlier – shows up again later, asking if she can stay. A funny scene happens with the six males talking about making her feel comfortable, feeling safe from being raped. Watson overhears the conversation and mistakenly thinks they are talking about plans to rape her. She confronts them while wielding a fireman's axe, and robs them of all their drinks before taking off. Without anything to hydrate them, the six guys take turns breaking through the floor to retrieve two jugs of water. A must see scene. Lots of laughs here.<br/><br/>Franco later confronts McBride for ji*zing on his ""nice magazine."" Hilarious scene. ""I have a particularly explosive ejaculate"" McBride says, explaining why his ji*z ended up on the magazine. ""You didn't learn to ji*z in a f**king sock or on a f**king tissue?"" Franco angrily asks. McBride scoffs at Franco for designing a house with iPads in the walls, but jerking it like a pilgrim. A comment on porno mags becoming seemingly obsolete in todays internet age.<br/><br/>I can go on and on about the countless comedy dialogue in this film. Oh, and as is often the case in a Rogen film, there is a Jew joke. Jonah Hill becomes possessed and is talking in what might be gibberish. Franco wonders if it's Hebrew. Rogen explains that he's somewhat of an authority on Hebrew, having spent six years in Hebrew school, and that Hill is definitely not speaking Hebrew.<br/><br/>Raunchy and raw, with an ad libbed and realistic feel, this movie absorbs your mind as if you were at the party with the cast, sharing laughs even with the apocalypse happening outside. I'll be watching this film again, and soon. I'm going to give this comedy a 10 out of 10."

","Seth Rogan did an amazing job at throwing this movie together. The movie is just non stop funny. They play complete opposites of themselves. Michael Cera isn't a crack addict in real life, Danny McBride isn't an Ahole like ""East Bound and Down"". The movie had everything you want. Not stop gags, gore, action and typical James Franco and Mcbride. The fact that they didn't even use the script for most the movie shows how talented these people really are. Emma Watson did a great job being a bad ass compared to her being Hermoine from Harry Potter. The movie is meant to be messed up and push the limits. Everybody is so uptight about religious crap that it can ruin a movie. 9/10 times movie critics hate your movie but every one i read loved this movie as much as i did. For the first time I've seen users hate on this movie. Even if you hated it i still would watch their other movies. Pure genius. The worst part of this movie is the Backstreet Boys."
"brando647","9","1","5","14 December 2013"," THIS IS THE END is Great Fun and a Treat for Fans
","THIS IS THE END is probably the funniest movie of 2013, unless you're not a fan of Seth Rogen and his crew. If you generally avoid his movies, you may as well steer clear because this movie has all the off-color, raunchy, potentially offensive goodies I expect with Rogen and longtime buddy/writing partner Evan Goldberg come together. THIS IS THE END has everything you could possibly want from an apocalyptic comedy: death, gore, bodily fluid gags, demons, demon rape, cannibalism, etc. I love the movie, but no one can say it isn't juvenile. This is not intellectual comedy to engage the mind. It's a movie where stoners discover the joy of drinking their own urine in a crisis situation. In an unusual twist, each of the actors/actresses in the movie portray an exaggerated version of themselves (or their public personas). It begins when Jay Baruchel arrives in Los Angeles for a weekend of fun and catching up with best buddy Seth Rogen. That night, Seth invites Jay to join him for a house- warming party at James Franco's house but Jay's not interested because he doesn't really gel with Seth's new Los Angeles crew of friends. Seth convinces him to go and Jay begins regretting it almost immediately when the Rapture begins and the good citizens of Los Angeles are pulled to Heaven in beams of light while the rest of humanity is left to fend for themselves. Now Jay is trapped in Franco's house with James Franco, Seth Rogen, Craig Robinson, Jonah Hill, and Danny McBride and the crew of spoiled actors are forced to fight for their survival as the world ends around them.<br/><br/>This movie is nearly two hours of a bunch of friends getting together and having a blast shooting a high concept comedy. Watching it, you know it had to be crazy fun to work on this set. These guys are all friends on and off camera and it adds an awesome chemistry for the movie. I think that's why I love the idea of each actor playing himself. I'm sure it helped bring their natural friendships into the characters. Each of them is more of a caricature of their public personas or exaggerated versions of their perceived personalities. Seth Rogen is an amiable, cowardly stoner. James Franco is educated and pretentious, with an awkward man crush on Rogen. Jonah Hill is overly saccharine with a holier-than-thou attitude stemming from his Academy Award nomination for his role in MONEYBALL. Craig Robinson is a chill ladies' man, and Danny McBride is an aggressive man-child. Plus the movie is loaded with cameos. I'm pretty sure everyone who's been part of the Apatow scene makes an appearance at Franco's house party in the first act: Michael Cera (as a scene-stealing cokehead), Paul Rudd, Jason Segel, Aziz Ansari, Kevin Hart, and more (including Rihanna, for some reason). And there are some even better cameos from people you'd never expect, including a post- HARRY POTTER Emma Watson (which isn't news, she's in all the trailers). It only drives home the vibe that this is a bunch of friends coming together to make this movie as fun as possible.<br/><br/>I honestly can't think of much to complain about with THIS IS THE END. It does it's job, and it kept me laughing pretty solidly from the opening titles to the end credits. There are some twists you might not see coming and I can honestly say there was rarely a dull moment. Right when you believe they can't possibly take this whole apocalypse scenario any further, they prove you wrong. Writers/directors Rogen and Goldberg throw just about everything they can at these guys, knowing that people will love to see a handful of pampered movie stars squirm under bizarre conditions. Food shortages, looting, demons, personal conflicts, and debating who may or may not be the house rapist are just some of the obstacles these guys will need to overcome if they hope to survive the end times. I really loved this movie and I think the usual fan base for this group of comedians are going to be very happy here. As icing on the cake, we get plenty of allusions to the guys' previous movies. Franco's character in particular has a fondness for keeping props from his previous movies. But the best comes in the form of an unofficial trailer for a sequel to Rogen and Franco's PINEAPPLE EXPRESS. I really think this movie was just as much for Rogen and his buddies as it was for the fans. THIS IS THE END is consistently hilarious and it's got some fun surprises, and I wouldn't be surprised if it finishes the years as one of my top favorite films for 2013."
"thebasquez","9","1","5","9 December 2013"," Stop saying this movie is bad
","Yes I'm giving this movie a 9/10 for some very important reasons.<br/><br/>1. This movie has some crude humor, but they get it RIGHT! That's hard to do! I'm impressed they made me laugh with all of it!<br/><br/>2. If you love the actors you'll love the film. People are like ""SETH ROGEN IS MY BELOVED ACTOR, HE WAS SUCH A HUGE LET DOWN."" No he wasn't, the whole movie was to make jokes about all the other actors and Rogen was the writer and director but he was not the focus of the movie, and he did a good job. ""Hermione stole all of our sh*t"" was a very laughable scene with Emma Watson and the other guys.<br/><br/>3. This whole movie is a satire!!! Some people gave this movie a bad rating because the whole religious aspect was not accurate, but they were making fun of the exorcist and the fact that bad people only do good things when they know they are going to die. They were making fun of the whole apocalyptic genre and it was really hilarious in general!<br/><br/>4. If you're reading reviews to see if the movie is good or not, just stop and watch the movie... It's definitely laughable.<br/><br/>9/10, upset Seth Rogen fans be quiet; actor and movie comedy was great, satire comedy was perfect, crude humor is actually funny. This movie is a must see!"

","I was reading other user reviews and saw people rate this movie 1 out of 10 stars just because they thought the overall rating is ""too high"". Seriously people? Rate it for what you think it is actually worth NOT because you think it the rating it too high. And seriously, it can't be the WORST movie you have ever seen. Even if I didn't adore this movie, I would never rate it a 1. OK. Now that that's out of the way I wanted to write a review from a more positive P.O.V.<br/><br/>Firstly, you should note before you watch this, this movie is not for everyone. This movie has a lot of swearing, and can be a little disturbing at times. This is not a critically acclaimed movie, and I feel as if people expect much more then they should from this comedy. <br/><br/>To continue, the theme may be uncomfortable for more religious viewers. I brought a friend to see this movie and she felt anxious and disturbed by the main theme of the movie.<br/><br/>HOWEVER, I absolutely ADORED this movie. I fell in love with it the first time I saw it, and in fact saw it three more times in theatre. The reasons I loved this movie so, is not only because I found it hilarious but I also found there were unexpected thriller scenes that I did not expect. As I have watched many movies, I tend to notice a similar pattern between the same genres. ""This is the End"" caught me completely off guard, and every seen was a surprise. The suspense of the unknown kept me on my toes the entire movie. <br/><br/>All in all, this is a great movie. If you like movies such as ""Superbad"" or ""Role Models"", then this is movie for you. I recommend this movie to almost everyone I encounter as it is suspenseful, interesting and hilarious."
"leonblackwood","7","1","5","17 November 2013"," Stupidly Funny! 7/10
","Review: I actually really enjoyed this movie. I laughed all the way through it, until the end which was a bit corny, but it didn't spoil the movie. Seth Rogen, who wrote and directed the movie, really did push the jokes to the extreme and it was great to see all of the stars together in one film. I liked the fact that they all played themselves and that they took the pee out of there own movies. The whole monster theme does to a bit too far, but that's what makes it funny. All of the actors put in great performances, and the cameos were great choices by the director. The only downside to the film was the ending, but apart from that, I would love to see the whole cast team up again to do another project because the chemistry was great. I know that this won't be everyone's cup of tea, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. A Great Watch!<br/><br/>Round-Up: From the beginning of the movie, I had a smile on my face, and when Michael Cera, who is known for his straight cut roles, plays a coked up mad man, I knew that this film was going to bring something different to the table. Emma Watson was a different but great choice for her part, and even Rihana made a small but effective contribution to the movie. Jay Baruchel's whining did get on my nerves a bit, but if think that was deliberate. The person that stood out from the rest, had to be James Franco who played his part well. I was hoping for a twist at the end, but I think Seth Rogen was trying to bring a moral to the story. You do have to have a warped sense of humour to enjoy the film, but if you have watched some of the casts work, then you will know what to expect.<br/><br/>Budget: $32million Worldwide Gross: $125million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into there comedies about a bunch of Hollywood actors who get attacked by monsters. 7/10"
"ahmyrah-palmer","8","1","5","17 October 2013"," This is the End
","This movie was hilarious. At first it was kind of slow and stupid but as it went on it was actually pretty good. It had its funny moments and dull moments. I liked the movie because it was about good and evil although it was stupidity. We all have our theories about the end times and how it may or may not end. So at least God is being considered and who knows it this stupid movie may actually cause someone to get saved (which is most important part). I hated the movie because some parts were dull and fake. I don't know what direction they were trying to take this movie as far as the bible but i don't like the fact that they keep mimicking God as if He is some kind of joke but whatever works im all for it. I also didn't like all the cursing and pot smoking they could have left some of that out but oh well. It was pretty cool movie."

","Jay Baruchel has just arrived in LA, a city he is not too fond of, and is staying with his best friend, Seth Rogan. Seth is determined to make Jay's stay in LA a good one and everything goes as planned until Seth drags Jay to James Franco's house-warming party.<br/><br/>This Is The End is one big inside joke where the funniest comedic actors working today jump in front of the screen all too willing to make fun of themselves. Between a cameo by Michael Cera and Danny McBride, it's the villains that steal the show. No matter how horrifying the events escalate outside, even when demonic figures rise from hell through a pit in James Franco's front yard, nothing is as frightening as having to be isolated with Danny McBride. Or even Jonah Hill.<br/><br/>Seth Rogan and Evan Goldberg have never really written anything more than bromance comedies that all follow the same plot points, thus all playing out as the same film just with different settings and characters. Dudes who already know each other become best friends after an adventure but not before fighting, getting all dramatic and making up with heavy homosexual undertones. With This Is The End, they prove not only to be capable directors but also better writers than they have lead us to believe through their past work. Though this one follows the same formula, it works better than ever before and the rest is non-stop laughs.<br/><br/>What's truly an achievement is that This Is The End works as a hilarious stoner comedy, an inside joke that allows the average viewer in on what they're making fun of and an excellent apocalyptic nightmare put to film. It's a hell of a lot of fun."

As a fan of horror comedy, I appreciated the over-the-top gross-out parts - they were hilarious and designed to make you squirm. It could've been better, I admit, but I would watch it again; there were some major laugh-out-loud moments. It seems clear all the actors had fun making it and their chemistry is there because lots of these people hang out in real life anyway. Trust me, if you like most of these actors and are familiar with their kind of humor, you'll like this movie. Just accept it for what it is and, though the ending is a little out of left field, just shrug, laugh, and accept it."
"estebangonzalez10","8","1","5","4 October 2013"," The funniest film of the year!
","¨Seth, that's some of the better acting that I've seen in your last six movies. Where was that in The Green Hornet?¨<br/><br/>This is the End is probably the most fun I've had with a comedy all year; I laughed so hard especially during the first hour of this raunchy/bromantic/stoner comedy. This is the directorial debut for Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg who have both written several screenplays together. Some of their screenplays have been hilarious (Pineapple Express, Superbad, and this one), while others have been a huge failure (The Watch and The Green Hornet). This film is actually based on a short they did in 2007, Jay and Seth Versus the Apocalypse. What I liked about the screenplay here is that they took a lot of risks and went places I'd never think anyone would. They weren't afraid of making fun of each other, some of their failures in movies such as The Green Hornet, but at the same time they also kind of played themselves (and one would imagine this is how they interact with each other normally). These guys were absolutely hilarious and I loved every second they were on screen together, but on the other hand I thought the film had a weaker second half containing some comedy/horror. It went too far for my personal taste, but I still have to give this film a lot of credit because it had me laughing during pretty much the entire first hour. There are a lot of movies and celebrity references that worked really well, and I can imagine that most of the dialogues here were improvised but that worked really well. The cameos were also used extremely well here and I thought they were all great. Some of the standouts here were Michael Cera making fun of himself, Danny McBride being ridiculously over the top with his antics, James Franco playing along with the gay rumors about himself and his pseudo artistic side, Jonah Hill being extremely nice but reminding us all he was nominated for Moneyball, Craig Robinson just being himself and singing along his hit song, Seth Rogen and Jay Baruchel trying to maintain their friendship which has coolen off over time due to Seth's new posies. There are just so many scenes that had me laughing out loud and so many funny lines that it is hard to pick my favorite moments. Emma Watson also had a great cameo and she looked lovely as always. Movie lovers will love all the references here and if you liked Pineapple Express than you are in for a treat as well as they discuss what the sequel would be about. If you've enjoyed Superbad and Pineapple Express than you're guaranteed to like this film because it keeps some of the core elements that made those movies so funny: the bromance and the raunchy dialogues. <br/><br/>This is the End is a film where every actor plays himself. I would say some play complete opposite personalities than the ones they actually have, or exaggerated versions of themselves, and they play along with the way critics or fans have tagged them. The film begins with Seth Rogen receiving Jay Baruchel at Los Angeles airport. Jay doesn't like LA very much, but Seth always makes him feel comfortable at his home. After a warm reception, Seth invites Jay to come along with him to James Franco's housewarming party. Jay doesn't really want to go because he doesn't get along really well with his friends, but goes anyway. At Franco's home there are several celebrities such as Rihanna, Michael Cera, Emma Watson, Christopher Mintz- Plasse, David Krumholtz, Aziz Ansari, Jason Segel, and many others who are all getting wasted and stoned. Seth introduces Jay to his closest buddies: Franco, Jonah Hill (who is extremely nice to Jay, but this just makes Jay feel awkward), and Craig Robinson. All of a sudden there is a big earthquake and a gigantic hole in the ground begins swallowing people. The apocalypse seems to be among us. Jay, James, Seth, Jonah, and Craig seem to be the only survivors at the house and they decide they must stick together and wait for rescuers to come and save them. The next day, Danny McBride shows up after having passed out during the party without having no clue of what happened. Now the six friends must find a way to survive and get along with each other if they want to make it through the apocalypse. <br/><br/>I know the plot doesn't seem all that exciting, but it really is hilarious to see these guys together. The narrative isn't the strongest thing about This is the End, what makes this film special is that the guys aren't afraid to take risks and they take the classical stoner comedies to another level. The movie isn't really about the apocalypse, it is actually more about friendship and self-parody (the guys are extremely narcissist at times). If you want to know what the true definition of bromance is then by all means go see this. The narrative may not work too well in the second half of the movie, but it really has to do with the dynamics between these characters who will do what it takes to survive. Despite the ridiculous plot, it is just so fun to watch these characters interact with each other and make fun of the things we've made fun of in their bad movies. The film can be very tasteless at times, but it is really funny. The comedy and horror was well balanced as well so I would have to admit this is the funniest movie of the year so far despite some ridiculous moments."
"Bruce722","7","1","5","2 October 2013"," Instant comedy classic!
","This is the end is the most unique comedy since the original Hangover. The concept of real life actors experiencing the apocalypse in a comedic sense is absolutely hilarious. Seth Rogen, Jay Baruchel, James Franco, Craig Robinson, and Jonah Hill shine as the core of the group of celebrity friends and I loved the cameos by all of the other celebrities but especially by Emma Watson, Michael Cera, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, and Rihanna (though I wish Emma had a bigger role... there's no such thing as too much Emma!). The laughter was almost from beginning to end. Honestly, the end is kind of why this film didn't get a higher rating from me. While there were still some parts that made me chuckle, it generally wasn't as funny as the first two-thirds or so of the movie and felt a bit rushed. All-in-all though, this is a must watch comedy, if you don't mind ridiculous and crude guy humor."

Lets say it massively helps if you are a fan of the Jonah Hill style of comedy and being able to stomach some quite tasteless puerile scenes is a prime requisite.<br/><br/>The story is (obviously) stupid but interesting. The ingenious off-screen personas the actors chose for themselves and their group interactions really made the film for me.<br/><br/>The only problem I had with this film was the pace, sometimes seemingly long, dull dialogues come out of nowhere and slowed things right down.<br/><br/>If you cannot handle light humoured (but sometimes extended) jokes about ejaculation, anal sex, rape and vaginas then seriously keep walking.<br/><br/>I found this a glorious, funny waste of time that I intend to repeat."

That being said, this one touches in a funny way a bit more on 'serious' matters, such as altruism and redemption.<br/><br/>On the downside, some may find the extreme gore scenes and the explicit language disturbing.

This film has a kind of Ghostbusters meets Tropic Thunder type thing going on, which provides an entertaining twist. However, an important thing to be mindful of about this film is that it is indeed a dark comedy, so if you're not a fan of that genre this is probably not the movie for you. Something that makes this film stand out is that one can clearly see the main cast in this movie is having a fun time and everyone is able to make fun of themselves, which is key considering the movie's plot-line.

","Now I've been hearing people compare this film to a Friedberg or Seltzer movie, but while the humor is the same, the style is vastly different. Now this film, This is the End is really funny and this is what I'd call a ""smart"" parody film. It pokes fun at a lot of many different things, but not in a way you'd see in Disaster Movie or Epic Movie. This film is gleefully offensive and sacrilegious, but that's how I like it. I think it was smart to pretend this was real life and have all the actors play themselves, because it added a touch of realism.<br/><br/>Seth Rogen's and Evan Goldberg's directorial effort is about how a bunch of famous celebrities deal with the Rapture and survive encounters with demons and even the Devil himself.<br/><br/>If you like each actor and think they're funny, then you won't be disappointed here. They all do a wonderful job from the back-stabbing James Franco to the stupid jerk Danny McBride to the serial killer-like Jonah Hill to the weed-loving Seth Rogen and to the people-hating Jay Baruchel. There were some awesome cameos and I won't spoil anything, but Michael Cera and Channing Tatum had the best ones hand down.<br/><br/>Overall, This is the End is a hard R-rated comedy that is something I haven't seen before. It's really funny, especially during the first half. This film also makes good use of special effects, as you'll aptly see in the second half.

I know this is a bold statement but the movie is 10 times better if you're already a fan of the actors/comedians. Jonah Hill was perfect.. plus the way everyone portrayed themselves how they would really act was brilliant. James Franco even stated in an interview that it was intentionally aimed at making fun of actors being so used to everything handed to them that they wouldn't know how to conventionally act in a natural disaster, or even an apocalypse for that matter.

","First I have to tell you guys, I don't like Seth Rogen. Nor his buddy movies. But this one is something special. At first it was like a typical buddy movie with Seth Rogen, and their friends, I wasn't sure, if I wanted to continue to watch it. But then the s*** happened, and all hell broke loose. It started to be so absurd it was funny as hell. This is a theme, that wasn't really touched before. Coming of the apocalypse, sure there are a lot of movies about that, but seeing how a bunch of incompetent people try to survive it, it was just hilarious. Everything happens in the movie you would want from a movie about the apocalypse. A lot of people die horribly, barricading against the looters, mistrust between the survivors, disagreements, fights, post-apocalyptic raiders. Everything is in there, and made as funny as hell. And then came the CGI orgasm at the end. I just couldn't believe my eyes. Just wow! They really put a lot of work into this movie. And the ending is just too much for me... Awesome movie! Way to go Seth, and friends! Your best movie yet guys, in my opinion!"
"Yesh4","10","1","6","17 June 2014"," One of the best comedies ever
","I love this film so so much. It's one of my favourite comedies... actually among my favourite movies ever. I guarantee that you'll enjoy it... that is if you have a sense of humour. All my favourite comedy actors in here and they all play crumby versions of themselves making it even funnier. They all have great chemistry and you can tell that they get along in real life. It's got many unpredictable moments that make you jump and it's just a barrel of laughs. Yeah it's got strong language and crudeness but what do you expect from a Seth Rogen movie? Plus if you are religious you may be offended- but I don't see how because it's so over the top that you can't possibly be offended. Also, I heard people on here say ""it's a movie to watch when you're stoned and if you're a guy"" well I beg to differ since I'm a teenage girl who would recommend this to anyone who has a sense of humour and can lighten up for an hour and 40 minutes. It's a must have in your DVD collections: it will cheer you up when you feel down or if you want to have a laugh with your friends."

One of those you'd watch with your mates. Perhaps it can be even funnier if you had some drugs too. Just pure fun. Not sure why people find it pretentious or self-indulgent - that was the whole idea, no? A meta comedy. As good as anything made a couple of decades ago by Mel Brooks et al. Well written / improvised dialogs, good visuals. Glad to see Rihanna to go first. Michael Cera was hilarious too - a caricature of himself.<br/><br/>Well done, guys. Off to check some memes."

","Seth Rogen, Jonah Hill, Craig Robinson, Jay Barachaul, Danny McBride, and James Franco trapped in a house in the end of the world- JACKPOT! When you watch a comedy film you want to have a good time and have fun. 'This is the End' is that on steroids. Every scene in this film is absolutely hilarious and couldn't have asked for a better cast to make this one ridiculously good time. Seth Rogen is his normal self playing a typical Seth Rogen character. He's great. Jonah Hill steals the show as playing a sensitive, nice, and cocky version of himself. Jay Barachaul is the guy who isn't funny in order to keep the simple plot in line. James Franco is funny as sort of a jerky guy and Craig Robinson is just hilarious as the wimpy, big guy who has great lines. But McBride is the one who will make you go ""he did not just do that."" Everything that comes out of his mouth makes your guts hurt almost as hard as Jonah Hill's screen time. Having fun with a comedy is a great way to enjoy film. If that's your request this is the end to searching for that kind of film."
"kourtjar","8","1","6","5 May 2014"," Fun Time
","This movie was much more enjoyable and feel good (end of the world aside) than I had expected. I could possibly say it's my favorite apocalyptic film. It didn't leave me with the same icky and anxious feelings as other apocalyptic movies. I give it a high rating because I simply had a good time watching it. I also enjoyed seeing the actors playing themselves, hearing movie references, and the soundtrack. Contrary to my opinion though, my husband did not feel the same way. For example, he felt the acting was forced, while I felt the actors were having fun playing extreme versions of themselves. He also did not laugh as loudly or as often as I did, proving that it may be a type of humor or style that isn't for everyone. It uses the style of humor from the actors' past roles, such as Pineapple Express, something I had assumed before watching."
"rgkarim","Null","2","19","14 June 2013"," A CavalCade of Comedy
","What would happen if six stars of stoner comedy films came together and were forced to face the end of the world? I didn't know either until I saw This is the End (TITE), a film written by one of these stars Seth Rogen, uniting his buddies from his various films to make what can only be an interesting adventure. Well interesting is exactly what you get with this tale and I'm here to shed some light on the latest comedy to grace the screen. <br/><br/>When I saw the poser and trailers for this movie there were two ways I could see this movie going: funny and full of insane, and wacky adventure, or another drug filled comedy where all they do is go from point A to point B and get stoned/drunk upon their arrival. TITE however, decided to mash these two path together to make a hybrid that surprisingly entertained me, though that didn't seem the case at first. Stoner comedy fans will rejoice at the beginning, watching Seth and Jay Baruchel getting hopped up on so much weed you'll wonder how their brains take it. Then head into the party scene where not only do we get to see the cavalcade come together, but other stars make a cameo to show off what may be a reflection of their lives off camera. It's crude, it's cursing filled, and has so many awkward/inappropriate/over the top lines that will have the audience either cringing or laughing their heads off, the former option more for me. Once the cataclysm event occurs, as seen mostly in the trailer, the drugs and booze or shifted down a notch and a new ""balance"" is reached that started to put this movie in better graces with me. So what did I like and dislike then.<br/><br/>Let's start with the balance of comedy TITE has. Rogen and company bring all of their styles to the table on this one, with each one playing the characters you know and love. The diversity starts with more drug comedy, that makes our ""heroes"" do some crazy and embarrassing situations that had most of the audience cracking up. Yet before this can grow stale, the movie transitions into curse filled talks about sex and all of its related bodily functions, sometimes leading to overexggarated arguments of two stars shamefully arguing about where they left their mark. For me however, the most laughs came from the parodies and quotes of various movies that are cleverly integrated into the dialog and plot to give the movie some pizazz. Rogen's pokes, or is it jabs at Hollywood productions also had me in stitches, and combined with some well-timed and clever quips there were plenty of laughs to go around that brought tears to my eyes from laughing so hard.<br/><br/>Of course with a collection of stars this big playing ""themselves"" you would think there would be some good laughs just from the characters themselves. Yes there were some characters I enjoyed, but for the most part the characters you see are those you've seen over and over again. Seth Rogen still plays that funny looking, and rather plain role that indulges in just about everything he can. James Franco, despite his diverse collection of roles, chose to go back to pineapple express mode and play the selfish jerk causing all the trouble, though he is slightly more in his mind. Jonah Hill plays that very soft toned, strange, and high pitched nerd who trades his attempts to be cool with his attempts to be peaceful, I think. My favorite of the bunch goes to Craig Robinson whose neutral tone, girlish screams, and well delivered quips had me rooting for the solo black actor. Of all the actors, his role had the most diversity for me, playing all the fields without going too far into one area, and without overacting. My least favorite character though had to be Danny McBride though, I've enjoyed some of his movies in the past, but I'm over his filthy dialog, arrogant rants, and perverted mannerisms that make him the wild dude that many like. His character is definitely the most annoying of the bunch and adds that black sheep/ doesn't give a damn edge that the movie needed, but could have toned down a little more. <br/><br/>Despite all of these things though there were still some over the line moments that I didn't care for in this movie. Although this is supposed to be a comedic take on the apocalypse, there are some things that didn't need to be shown. Seeing the guys play soccer with a decapitated head and seeing cannibalism at its ""finest"" are just two areas I'm not comfortable with watching. I also don't enjoy the concept of butt, or for that matter, regular raping as well. Sure the awkward reactions of the guys is fun to watch, but the concept penetrating someone in that way is not my cup of tea. Yet the biggest thing at bugged me has to be the visible shots of the devil's penis. Sorry I don't find seeing the male anatomy in all its lava orange/ brimstone gray glory, but that is something I think best left for the adult only films if you like that stuff though get ready to relive the Dante Inferno game all over. <br/><br/>Factoring in everything though, TITE isn't a half bad comedy and was a fun idea to watch on a concept vaguely touched in the comedy world. I think the actors worked well together, the comedy stays rather fresh and appropriate, and although not the most surprising plot has a few things that may shock and surprise you. Overall Rogen did a good job making fun of a holy topic in a way that won't get him smite, but for those who are a bit more sensitive on this topic avoid the film. My scores are: Comedy: 7.5 Movie Overall: 6.5-7.0"
"newbuch123","7","1","7","29 September 2014"," A very creative and in most part a fun one!
","I hadn't quite read the storyline before watching and I assumed it was a pretty ordinary one, the world was ending and all the main characters who were kind of dumb had to fix it (a bit like The World's End). I was very wrong, this movie was much funnier than I thought it would be! In most parts, very entertaining!<br/><br/>I recommend this especially to you who like other Seth Rogen films like ""Bad Neighbours"" and ""Superbad"", cause it's got the same kind of taste. If you're having a nice evening with your friend then absolutely! There are a bit of sexual jokes in it, so if you can handle it, watch it with your parents!<br/><br/>I give this a 7/10 cause of its creativity and the big amount of laughs it gives you. Nearing its end though it will perhaps get a bit boring."
"moviemikereviews","Null","1","7","12 June 2013"," This Is The End - May contain minor spoilers
","Seth Rogen finds sure footing after stumbling along as the writer of the less-than-stellar ""The Watch"" with the wildly inappropriate and funnier-to-boot ""This Is The End."" Rogen reteams with co-writer/co-director Evan Goldberg (the pair having worked on ""Pineapple Express"" and ""Superbad"" together among others) to adapt their nine-minute short ""Jay and Seth vs. The Apocalypse"" into a feature film. ""Jay and Seth vs. The Apocalypse"" is rumored to have cost $3,000, stars five of the six main actors in the adapted feature (Rogen, Jay Baruchel, James Franco, Jonah Hill, and Danny McBride), and was never released to the public. Rogen's directorial debut joins the five actors with fellow funny man Craig Robinson as well as a boat-load of cameo appearances from other contemporary comedy giants who all play over-the-top versions of themselves in this horror-comedy that pokes fun at the privileged lives of the Hollywood elite.<br/><br/>""This Is The End"" opens with Seth picking up his long-time friend Jay, who has come down from Canada to rekindle a friendship that has lost some of its spark since Seth has become Hollywood royalty and joined a new crowd. Jay's distaste for L.A. becomes readily apparent and is only perpetuated when Seth insists that the two should attend a housewarming party at Franco's mansion in the Hollywood Hills. Jay eventually gives in and the pair enter James' stunning house, cleverly designed by the multi-talented actor/writer/director/grad-student/teacher himself as he is only too willing to point out. The party is out of proportions in something similar to a scene out of the ""Entourage"" and complete with sex, copious amounts of drugs, and seemingly everyone in Hollywood who was free on that day of filming. Jay's level of discomfort increases throughout the party as he feels out of place and fails to click with Seth's new friends.<br/><br/>As the party is in full swing it is crashed by none other than the apocalypse, played out in biblical proportions with fire, brimstone, crashing cars, gaping holes in the earth, and slivers of blue light drawing people into the sky. After the dust clears, the death toll is enormous including Aziz Ansari, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, David Krumholtz, Jason Segel, Kevin Hart, Martin Starr, Michael Cera, Mindy Kaling, Paul Rudd, and Rihanna. Those who sought shelter inside of Franco's mansion survive including Franco, Rogen, Hill, Robinson, and Baruchel. As reality sets in, the group prepares to wait out the disaster by rationing food and discussing sleeping arrangements in a set of scenes that continue the gut-busting dialogue you would expect from members of the Judd Apatow gang. With the morning comes a new set of surprises, mainly the presence of Danny McBride who awakes from a drunken sleep oblivious to the events of the previous night and makes breakfast for the gang, considerably depleting their already scarce food supply.<br/><br/>With McBride comes a slew of insults so fast-paced and explicit that you feel as if you are getting the inside scoop on how comedic actors treat each other off set. Hilarity ensues as the star's egos collide and they spiritedly backstab each other for resources. Emma Watson makes an appearance before deciding to fend for herself in the outside world after overhearing the six males talk about the ""rapey vibe"" that they were putting off. McBride oversteps his boundaries by taking more than his share of the rations and is thrown out of the mansion. Jay finds religion as he begins dutifully reading the Book of Revelation and determines that the disaster is in fact the Rapture. And Hill becomes possessed in a scene that pits him against the newly-spiritual Jay for an exorcism that delivers huge laughs before the film turns to an effects-driven climax that ironically finds the Jewish actors in a Christian-like light as they dwell on whether or not they are worthy of salvation.<br/><br/>This Is The End's greatest success comes from how the film portrays the six main actors. Nobody takes themselves too seriously and in fact the actors embrace the way the world views them. Franco is always drawing attention to his successes, including showing off various film keepsakes such as the camcorder from ""127 Hours"" and a World War I era pistol from ""Flyboys."" Hill teases his nice-guy persona, even downplaying his Oscar nomination. McBride plays the bad boy and troublemaker while Baruchel portrays the actor who hasn't quite reached the level of success as his companions. Robinson and Rogen also deliver enormous fun including Rogen joking about his signature laugh. The actor's careers are also called into question with films like ""The Green Hornet"" and ""Your Highness"" being the butt of jokes. Fans of this group of actors will find themselves on the floor laughing while those opposed might be better off skipping this film.<br/><br/><ul><li>Movie Mike (http://www.moviemikereviews.com/this-is-the-end-review/)</li></ul>"

","The movie's greatest strength is the fact that it never takes itself too serious. But, even then, its script follows a traditional structure. It does take some liberties when adding ridiculous montages (when they fix the house at the beginning of act two or when they get high, the couple times or so they do).
The plot escalates into ridiculousness but it always makes sense within the story world, which is another strength.<br/><br/>I do have to say that the first act felt too long and boring at times. It takes 16 minutes for the apocalypse to start. In these kind of movies, the audience is here to watch the characters deal with the apocalypse. The first act has to establish the basic story world and characters, but I think the movie could've done this in 10 minutes, maybe even less, as opposed to the long 16 minutes.<br/><br/>Still, a pretty funny movie."

The above mentioned actors try to survive an apocalyptic event by holing out in Franco's new house. While trying to survive, their interpersonal relationships come into focus and makes them introspect. There's little significance of actors playing themselves in the movie, apart from adding to the quirkiness of it. The comedy gets stale after sometime.

One of my favourite parts was the ending, growing up through primary school with the Backstreet Boys, Spice Girls and Human Nature as some of the bands of the day, watching this movie end with a performance from the Backstreet Boys was just awesome. I couldn't help but sing along and dance in my seat. I honestly don't know how this movie works, as its a kind of ridiculous storyline, but somehow it does, and its a great way to lift your mood and watch something that'll make you laugh."

","It is obvious that many of the reviewers here did not understand the movie at all. Sad, as it's not particularly deep. But it is sublimely funny. It does not show how ""cool"" Hollywood is, nor is it meant to. It satires how godless, fake, self-righteous, pretentious and worthless most people in Hollywood are, and because of the choices they make in life, if the Bible is to be believed (that's the premise), they are ALL going South. Every single Hollywood person. No one is spared. So much so that the entire A/B list house party didn't even know the rapture happened because NOBODY attending was worth saving.<br/><br/>The judgmental and vapid conversations that take place are true to life. I worked there. I can attest. And yet they all believe that they are the best people in the world. I mean, they have to convince you they are hot even when they are cold at the beach in winter, after all. That's a hard job! That's acting. They deserve to get paid way more than us and to pass judgment on the rest of society... (that's a paraphrase from the film, but it's so true).<br/><br/>Let's make it clear to those who can't understand: these actors are not playing themselves. They are playing characters with the same name as themselves, but for the most part, are various stereotypes of Hollywood people, and are very, very accurate portrayals. From the rescue dog who's owner doesn't believe it knows how to bark, to the belief that gluten is a catch-all phrase that means anything bad for you except pot and alcohol, and the fact that no friends or colleagues challenges these stupid assertions lest they be seen as judgmental, it's an accurate indictment of what passes for intelligence in their business. It's a modern LA Story, except rather than learning how to love in a place where love is meaningless, this group has to learn how to be a selfless person in an industry that is 100% selfish.<br/><br/>Michael Cera is funny in his cameo as ""Michael Cera"", someone very different from who he really is, and plays the drug addled sex fiend with the lilly-white public persona quite well. Jonah Hill plays the ""the more I tell you I like you, the more I hate you"" phony perfectly, and only shows his true self when possessed by a demon. Jay plays the ""I'm too good for Hollywood"" jerk well too. And James Franco does a good over-the-top James Franco (he is like that, but less so in real life). Gotta give him credit for laughing at himself and admitting he's not savable.<br/><br/>Are there some slow parts? Yes. By the nature of the problem of the rapture, they must remain in a house for days while the world around them goes to heck, because they need to figure out how to be saved. And that can't be 100% comedy. But what happens does matter to the plot (and yes, there is one). And Emma Watson robbing them of their supplies was a pretty good twist.<br/><br/>Is this movie funnier to insiders than to people who don't know who any of the actors are and don't pay much attention to Hollywood? Sure, but so what? Not every movie is for everyone, and not everyone will relate to all subject matter. But that doesn't make it a 1 out of 10. That just means you don't get it because it's about something you don't care about. Nothing wrong with that. Just move along.<br/><br/>I hated Black Swan. Doesn't mean it sucked. Okay, maybe it does..."

These actors realising they have made bad films just provides a great premise for this film and just makes this a laugh out loud film.

","After being hounded by a friend to watch this movie for a couple of weeks I gave in and watched it with him last night on the heels of McGruber, a film I'll never tire of that supplements the perfect humor for its genre of comedy. This is the End was sadly, a disappointment. <br/><br/>A stellar cast of some great funny guys, Danny McBride, Craig Robinson and Michael Cera. Thankfully James Franco, an actor I prefer in his dramas, was a highlight like his other comedy dishes, Pineaplle Express and Your Higness.

Anyway, here's the plot. <br/><br/>Set as themselves, the six mains are set to live it up at Francos art decor super house with the arrival of Jay, Seth's seemingly good friend and fellow Candianlite. Things go bad to worse as the party falls through, this is a pun as a giant hole from Hell appears in the ground in front of Francos home as he hosts LA's apocalypse to massively erected demons to hell hounds and an axe wielding Emma Watson. <br/><br/>It was a shame for myself as the jokes were endless but just were too weak, generic or perhaps not to my style. Most Danny Mcbride, Craig Robinson and Emma Watson scenes were by far the highlight of the film. I also found the gags best worked when bounced around by some of the acts but nearly none really was as hyped up to be. <br/><br/>I give This is the End a 6/10"

","Well, I had no idea what this movie was about; the only thing people told me is that it would involve a party in James Franco's house, but I'd never guess the special effects and the crazy storyline this movie have. So that's it, there is a party, and all of a sudden, we have an earthquake that transforms everything outside into pure chaos. From that point on, the film became a ""Scary Movie 4"" without the funny jokes that parody had-- which is a shame. I mean, it's not that the cast didn't try to be funny, but the plot and the conversations are just too nasty and repetitive to provoke a laugh. Most of the jokes involve penis, sperm, ass and everything that the male world is always talking about when girls are not around. For this reason, I really doubt the female audience will recognize any merits in this project-- and I'm completely OK with that. The only indeed funny situation is when they make fun of Emma Watson and her unforgettable character in ""Harry Potter"". Despite that, there is not a reason for you to laugh. Also, there aren't reasons for you to feel interested in the story, since you couldn't care less about the silly ""characters""-- or personalities? Bad movie anyways, don't feel isolated if you're the only one who hasn't seen it yet."

Of course, this movie will not be to everyone's tastes. It's rude and crude but for me that is part of the appeal. A bunch of man-children left behind during the Apocalypse fighting over the last crumbs of civilization. Jay Baruchel is great as the everyman outsider that we're supposed to identify with and the rest of the cast is hilarious. I'm guessing there was a LOT of ad-libbing going on and if that's the case, then these guys are some of the most fun dudes you could could ever spend the end of the world with. If you don't want to know about or see drug use, rape jokes, extreme violence and gore, explicit masturbation chat and constant homosexual references then stay away. Excellent production values and camera-work. I downgraded a point for its excessive length. They could've easily pared down about 30 minutes and made this movie tighter. Still, I haven't laughed as hard at a comedy in years. If you've got a dark and twisted sense of humor, this movie is a must see."
"sohansurag","7","0","5","24 December 2013"," A hilarious END indeed!
","Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen strikes an almost perfect comic note with This is The End. Its studded with characters playing their exaggerated selves. So Seth Rogen is the same guy in every one of his movies, Danny McBride is jerkier than ever, James Franco is still stuck with memories from Pineapple Express and still thinks he's besties with Seth, and the recently Academy Award nominated Jonah Hill is trying hard to be the nicest guy ever.<br/><br/>As mentioned above its an almost perfect stoner movie. This is The End is exactly what you'd expect when Seth Rogen teams up with Evan Goldberg. Its raunchy, juvenile and situational. This is a movie where you'd want to appreciate the idiocy and callowness of 30 year olds running around during a weird scenario. Our protagonists, Seth Rogen, Jay Baruchel, Jonah Hill, Craig Robinson and Danny McBride finds themselves stuck at James Francos house when all hell breaks loose outside and the forthcoming events are nothing short of uproarious. I am sure the cast had a splendid time shooting and the enthusiasm could be felt. The same could be said about Seth and Evan directing them, they did have a blast and it could be seen on screen. The utter stupidity that's smeared through to the end had me in splits. Where in some movies the stars might have emerged as legendary heroes saving the day, you snigger at protagonists' sheer helplessness here instead.<br/><br/>There are many scenes where you think the cast was just ad-libbing but you can't help but chuckle at them coz it felt like they were having a natural argument or conversation like they would in real life. Like those repulsively hilarious argument between James Franco and Danny McBride about the cum on a porn magazine. Having played their own exaggerated counterparts, the actors got a real chance at making fun of their own movies. There were loads of references to other movies that as soon as I finished watching it I had an immense craving to watch Pineapple Express and Superbad again, thanks to the mock-sequel that was played in-movie. And then there were the cameos, its just stupendously hilarious how each of them turned out to be.<br/><br/>Post the 2nd act it takes on a dark shade but they even managed to make a poke fun at it making way for more laughs. And when you thought it was losing steam, it quickly picks up the pace ensuring even more entertainment. Had those scenes been a bit trimmed, it would have been perfect. I was also a bit put off with the excessive bromance.<br/><br/>We're are not unacquainted with movies like this, we'd previously got Shaun of The Dead and Zombieland sharing the same genre. In an industry populated by endless stoner and apocalypse movies This is The End stands out. It carves a niche of its own, inducing a kind of natural comedy into scenarios like this. Much like the ad-libbing cast, This is The End is unpredictable, ridiculously dirty and prodigiously hilarious. Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen has indeed hit pure comedy gold with This is The End."

The warped versions of each of the stars' real life personalities are refreshing as it can be uncommon to see actors as big as they are having the ability to really make fun of each other and not take themselves too seriously. <br/><br/>Admittedly the movie does fail in certain aspects. The story line obviously doesn't run deep and Emma Watson's acting was uncomfortably amateur to the point where she just looked awkward on screen. None of this really mattered though as it seemed clear just 20 minutes in that Sony weren't funding a movie intending to be the next titanic.<br/><br/>At heart the 'not taking themselves too seriously' is what makes this film.

This movie has struck comedic genius, since that opening day I have watched the movie three more times and it never gets old. The combination of all of these actors putting together some of their best performances made for a phenomenal and hilarious movie. Personally I think this is one of the funniest movies released in the past couple of years. This movie is not like most ordinary comedies that have a funny first half then slowly becomes less and less funny as the movie goes on; this movie successfully maintains its level of comedy through out the entire movie. Even though the end of this movie turns a bit sentimental and tries to teach you a lesson like many comedies do at the end they managed to keep it just as funny. This is a task that is not often done well but I feel that it was very well executed in this film. Though having said all of this I must admit that this movie is not for every one. If you are looking for a well done intelligent movie look else where this movie is not for you. This movie is full of vulgar comments and jokes that some might find distasteful. If you are not a large fan of similar movies like super bad and pineapple express than you will most likely not be a fan of this movie, however if you are then this is a must see! I put this movie in the same genre as these two movies but in reality it is really a genre of its own. It starts of as regular funny movie but it takes twists and turns that you could never have expected. The creativity of this movie is undeniable and makes for a movie different than any thing I have ever seen before. If you are looking for a movie that will entertain you and give you a good laugh then I highly suggest this movie for you."

They have created a hilarious movie with a laugh out loud script to coincide with certain actors in Hollywood. And they wrote all the characters to be stereotypes of themselves but turned up in the most ridiculous way. Making a movie full of hilarious and quotable moments full of great dialog and even some well done action scenes. One thing I even appreciated them doing was talking about something earlier in the film and then following up on it later. For example, they talk about Channing Tatum living on the street of the James Franco and you eventually see him later on in a ridiculous fashion. The acting in this movie, was done the way it was supposed be done. No bad comments but a majority of the characters are just small cameos and they were all fantastic. This is the End is pretty much an ultimate bro movie and never takes it self seriously but that's why its so awesome it's just so ridiculous with its writing and succeeds amazingly in that aspects and in many other aspects too. <br/><br/>I recommend watching this movie with your brother who is old enough(please don't show a 10 year movie) or dude who finds movies with crude humor funny. Don't expect your girlfriend to like this movie unless she's not weirded out about D**k jokes but otherwise watch this movie with a group of friends. <br/><br/>A great and hilarious comedy which is funnier and better than I expected.<br/><br/>Verdict:<br/><br/>7.5/10"

","""This Is the End"" was probably the comedy movie of this summer. A quality cast all playing themselves and how they deal with an apocalyptic scenario got millions of people into theaters as a valid alternative to open-air baths. I thought this film was 100 minutes of escapism at its best. I laughed a lot at one-liners, situation comedy and particularly those scenes in which the stars make fun of themselves, like right at the beginning when Rogen gets sort of bullied by an overambitious interviewer about how he always plays the same character.<br/><br/>The story is told quickly. Old friends Jay Baruchel and Seth Rogen reunite for a weekend of fun. One of their activities besides playing video games and smoking weed is going to a big party at James Franco's house. Unfortunately, at the same time the apocalypse begins. The movie has a lot of serious sub-plot lines, stuff about God, changing friendships and moral decency, but it's always with a funny undertone. So this is 100% comedy, well maybe a few percent sci-fi, but never really seriously dramatic. A lot of it made me laugh, but nothing really stayed in the mind, except maybe the scene in which Franco seems to rise to the heavens, then goes nuts and goes back down again. Here and there, there's a couple things that could have been done better. First of all, it's a massive sausage fest with short cameos by Mindy Kaling, Rihanna and Emma Watson. The latter should have had a bigger part perhaps, although I felt sorry enough for her already with the little screen time she had here and I wouldn't really want to imagine how a female could bear with these boys for half an hour of the film or longer. The rape talk was also one of the many funny wtf moments I had. Others would be Jonah Hill as a zombie or everything involving Michael Cera in the first 20 minutes.<br/><br/>Performance-wise, nobody was really on awards-worthy level. The writing is the best aspect about it. From the cast, my personal favorite was Danny McBride I guess. He was almost the oldest of the bunch (behind Robinson), but also the funniest. His line delivery was as hilarious as his actions, like when he tried to kill them all not knowing it wasn't a real gun. The special effects, especially the monsters, weren't too shabby either given this was actually not really a fantasy/superhero film. All in all, it was quite an entertaining movie with many interesting contemporary references (Gangnam style etc.). It's nothing I'd be too eager to see anytime soon again, but if you like stuff like ""The Hangover"" and take it for what it is and don't go in it with too big expectations, you'll have a good time."

","If it is entertainment you are looking for I can ensure you that ""This is the end"" will not disappoint! I think my first laugh came in about 1 minute in the film, I was interested that quick. Although I did enjoy the film I do think that some parts of the film was a little bit over the top or unnecessary. Just little things were there that bothered me like Rihanna as a part of the cast to waist about 2 minutes of the film. I did love Jonah Hill & Seth Rogen performance in the film as it was another great film for them and continue to stand out. Emma Watson had another great performance and it just shows that she isn't just Hermione Granger from Harry Potter. Maybe I'm being a little harsh on the time wasting part of the film, but I will defiantly advise everyone to watch this film! Hard to disappoint and a great laugh!!!"

","I liked the movie, but I didn't like the backstreet boys. They should of gone without Backstreet boys. I already puked twice today. Seriously, who had the bright idea of using backstreet boys in the movie. I liked the ending except that. One thing is for sure, I will never look at either of them the same way again. I think the rest of the movie was good. And it was pretty funny, not as funny as I would expect. I would of liked to see more smoking weed. Ohh how I wish I could smoke or vaporize just what they had in the movie. It sucks being super sick, and disabled. And have no access to weed, in a medical marijuana state. Its still nice to watch movies about weed, and dream of better days. As long as I am alive. :) I liked the part when people ride the blue energy beam into the sky. And the Devil, and demons where pretty cool. Except I could of done without the big dicks. Believe me I am not as closed minded as I might appear. I just don't like dicks, and backstreet boys. However I do see how they both go good together. lol"

","The story begins unpredictably, where actor Seth Rogan picks up fellow friend and actor Johnny, Jay..(?), never remember his name, and soon join like actors at a wild festivity at James Franco's crib. <br/><br/>The cameos made by Michael Cera and Rhianna are the most memorable, but the seemingly forced addition of others come off as unnecessary and irrelevant to the plot. Eventually, chaos erupts and the apocalyptic fun begins.<br/><br/>The star cast: James Franco, Jonah Hill, Seth Rogan, Jay Beruchel, Craig Robinson and Danny McbRide, are what really make this movie so good. Supposedly, 50% of this movie was improv, and the realism felt in the dialogue create a genuineness impossible to create in any scripted film. Also worth mentioning is Emma Watson's small role, and the story behind creating her character. Apparently, Seth Rogan questioned her character because he felt that it might seem ""rapey"" with her being the only female in a house with five guys. His comedic choice to incorporate this uncertainty in the film was genius, and somehow completely works.<br/><br/>My main criticism would focus largely on the artificiality of the props and the gore. It would be a shame to see future films cross more into what I can only describe as gore humor, similar to that of the Scary Movies franchise.<br/><br/>All in all, Seth Rogan and Evan Goldberg's auteuristic homage to late 80's to early 90's comedy films is a refreshing relief to the same tired slapstick movies tagged as comedies to come out in the past 10 years. The chemistry of the cast, strung with the improvised dialouge and laugh out loud jokes and scenes, is a genre I look forward to seeing more of. <br/><br/>6.4/10"

","I felt that I had to add my ten cents here because there are so many reviewers who gave this one star. Really? I can imagine certain people finding this offensive. But I can't imagine anyone not laughing in this film. If you don't laugh there must be something wrong with you. Maybe you've never done drugs, or never masturbated. <br/><br/>If you've seen these actors in other projects you can kind of guess what you're in for here. This is both MORE CRASS and MORE IMAGINATIVE than their other films. In some ways it really does push some boundaries so I guess it might have offended a few people. I'm sure the cast would have been disappointed if it didn't.<br/><br/>The only reason I didn't give this 10 out of 10 is because I thought the musical choices were boring and a bit stereotyped. Backstreet boys? Gangnam style? Paper planes? These songs didn't seem left field enough to fit with the rest of the movie, and I couldn't imagine the characters really listening to this stuff in real life. DMX and the Ruffrider crew got a name check at one point so it seemed logical that they should be getting down to something like that."
"callanvass","6","0","3","28 October 2013"," Despite all the self awareness, I didn't think it was nearly as funny as people are saying
","After glowing reviews for this movie, I was rather excited to see this movie. I wasn't able to watch it in theaters, so the long wait was finally over. I was rather disappointed with the movie as a whole. It's not nearly as clever as it thinks it is. It's very self aware, with many jabs amongst the cast. Some of them are very amusing, and a lot of them fall flat. Favorite was probably the crack about Seth Rogen playing the same character in every movie. I like Seth, but that is kinda true. I was not a fan of the lewd humor in this movie. I've gotten tired of raunchy comedies for the most part. I did enjoy some things about it though. Emma Watson going nuts was fun, as was Michael Cera's small role as a coke snorting fiend. Another problem I had was my dislike of some of the cast members. I don't like Craig Robinson, James Franco, and I can't stand Jay Baruchel. I will give credit to both Seth Rogen and Jay Baruchel for having solid chemistry, but it doesn't change the fact that Jay belongs nowhere near the upper echelon of comedic actors. Danny McBride was the worst, though. He relies on being as offensive as possible to generate laughs, without being naturally talented. Some scenes run far too long. Jonah Hill's spoof of The Exorcist was painful to witness, and ran on far too long for my liking. It is pretty ballsy at times. The rapture storyline was pretty controversial. And I can definitely see why Christian's would get offended by it. It didn't offend me personally. I found it to be rather brave, but I can see how it would irk some. Everyone is playing an exaggerated version of themselves here. It's hard to rate the performances, when that is the case. Seth Rogen probably came off as the best. It has many Celeb cameo's such as Rihanna, Channing Tatum, and as mentioned. Emma Watson & Michael Cera. The finale is my favorite part of the film by far. It has some great gags. This is worth a watch. It does make you laugh, but there is far too much inconsistency in between. This movie did make me wanna do one thing. I'm gonna go listen to some Backstreet Boys! <br/><br/>6/10"

","The Review: As a student , I always tend to have one thing on my mind and that is... if this film does not match the trailer, which persuaded me to come and view this film in first instance, then I have literally thrown my money down the drain and will be most displeased.<br/><br/>Fortunately this was not the case. 'This is the End' was a film which ,until I became fully engaged ,after the first twenty minutes approximately I exceeded past a worst- fear cine-experience.<br/><br/>Many movies evolve around actors who play themselves in comical situations as a new and exciting comedy endorsement against their successes but this is the first one I have seen which places high-profile celebrities in a career-shaking reality. Canadian Actor, Jay Baruchel who appeared in 'Million dollar baby' and 'She's out of my league', American Actor, Craig Robinson who starred in 'Shrek forever after' and 'Hot tub time-machine' and James Franco who featured in 'Rise of the planet of the apes' and 'Oz, the great and powerful' all have comedic roles which fused, in places, high levels of 'cringey' audience laughter.<br/><br/>The plot sees the Director, Seth Rogen and Actor, Jay Baruchel drop in at a house-warming party at James Franco's home. The party starts with many famous guests indulging in extremity where Celebrities 'let their hair down' and continues even when the apocalypse starts outside. This is where the funnier scenes arise.<br/><br/>Blue-light rays onto some characters and their bodies are detracted from earth. Characters are taken to either heaven or hell depending on their life as abiding citizens of God through their life-long good deed and will. Soon there are only a handful of actors left trying to survive. The party dies to a feeling of character indecency and begins an aspiration for them to change their ways.<br/><br/>I would encourage film-fanatics to give this one a go and give it time to pick up to the funnier scenes which really will make you giggle. On the other hand, I would also encourage those sensitive to envisaging sex, drugs and alcohol that this film is just not for you.<br/><br/>The film exerts a compelling plot within the first two-thirds but by the end it seems like the writers began running out of ideas when creating hell on earth.<br/><br/>Some of the jokes I did not understand- to fully understand them you need to have seen the films referenced especially 'Pineapple express'.<br/><br/>However, why not give this film a go and share some humane and prophetic-laughs. <br/><br/>Reviewed By: Rachael Gilbert<br/><br/>Join the debate on our Facebook Group (www.facebook.com/groups/Filmsploitation) or on our website (www.thefilmpodcast.co.uk)"
"thefadingcam","8","0","3","25 October 2013"," Not so good for the unprepared eye, but a great piece of filmmaking in reality
","It is hard to talk about This is The End in little words. Raised with great expectations, This is the End could easily be the biggest disappointment of the year. The movie could have ended up in a self-indulgent way of approaching aggravated versions of the real actors who play the movie. It could even end up in a silly ""spot the celebrity"" movie. Fortunately, this was not the case. Well yes, the ""spot the celebrity part"" is there, and it is awesome as there are dozens of cameos of well known comedy actors, but there is much more. The storyline, inserted in the crazy over the top apocalypse scenario, is guided by a series of small scenes, which you could define as small sketches, some awesome, others not that awesome, but overall with a great soul. The bromantic side of these group of actors is funny as hell, and their sissy versions of rich motherf**** actors is hilarious. But it's the inside jokes that stand out, the real movies where these actors played like Pineapple Express, Moneyball or even Million Dollar Baby are mocked, just like the actors themselves for some other not so good roles they have taken. And let's face it, the level of ambition of this movie was sky high, and as expected, there was some stuff that didn't turn out so smoothly. The overall movie feels strange, weird, sometimes it feels like an amateur comedy with bad computer effects, and it has a hard time connecting to the audience for a bit, but that is also part of its soul. It is large in numbers, but light in formula. But then we are presented by some scenes that really could go to the book of best scenes in comedy history, and that deserves a standing ovation. It's a delight to see Franco, Rogen, Jonah Hill (I could be here for ages) together, and the final product is indeed very weird but incredibly funny and original. This is the End is a comedy that you can compare with no other in style, breathing quality for almost every scene. Visit thefadingcam blog on blogspot for more reviews!"
"fluxn21","5","0","2","10 October 2013"," An Amusing Diversion
","This Is The End was amusing and worth watching. It was funny, ridiculous and a show of utter self-indulgence, while maintaining full awareness of its utter self-indulgence (that was kind of the point of the movie). That said, don't go looking to come out of watching it with greater insight into humanity, Hollywood or anything else.<br/><br/>If one unburdens oneself from the need to take anything meaningful away from the movie and simply watches to enjoy these actors bantering because they lack of anything better to do as the end times rain down – then you'll find it, as I did, a mindlessly hilarious comedy that was perfect for a summer evening with friends when thinking wasn't really the goal of the night. The beginning was really hilarious, the middle bits were amusing but dragged on a bit, and the conclusion was pretty damn funny too, if pointlessly over the top.<br/><br/>Some said it was a little too scary for a comedy, but hey, at least these elements served to move a plot that went somewhere unlike many of its rivals in the mindless category that are truly horrifying, pointless, over budgeted, ungrounded and plainly inept (i.e. Breaking Dawn Part 2).<br/><br/>The film was about bad people, and it takes literally the end of the world for them to own up to it – a clichéd sentiment when talking about Hollywood, but expressed in such an amusingly direct manner as to make this film fun. You better already like the cast and have seen some of their other work, otherwise you'll probably find the movie pretty flat and needlessly ridiculous.<br/><br/>I loved the references to their other movies (like Fanco having the camera from 127 Hours), the bromance and watching these guys play caricatures of themselves pointlessly searching for redemption. I never 'lost myself' in it as I watched, and I think that makes the movie fit nicely into the ""something to put on when you're having a few friends over and nobody is really paying all that much attention to the movie anyway"" category. Really, I think that was probably part of the message of the movie – quit paying so much attention to these people and quit judging them for their outrageous lives, they're all damned anyway. Instead, just enjoy what they are offering here, mindless hilarity that still dwarfs so many of the mindless movies that claim to offer something serious."
"pheNomaNom","4","0","2","28 September 2013"," Could have been good, wish it got some Christian things right
","I think this movie could have been good, but it may have turned into a Christian film... which I'm sure the writers wouldn't intend and many people wouldn't like. This movie did a really good job of capturing the lifestyles of celebrities and showing the main characters who weren't raptured to be depraved, selfish, and immoral people, like to an extent, every person is! We have all sinned, so we all deserve to be destroyed and go to hell. The movie did a good job of showing this aspect. It had a good setup as a result for the main characters to realize there was a God and then be saved. <br/><br/>The problem was that those who were ""saved"" did so in a wholly unbiblical way (whether or not you believe, it would be nice to have shown what the bible actually says), when they had a bible right there and one would think with all there free time and the chaos going on around them they would be inspired to read at least one of the gospels and realize that they aren't going to be saved by doing good things, and instead that they needed to accept that Jesus died on the cross for their sins. That is the only way to be saved based on the biblical apocalypse scenario they were portraying. But I understand that it would probably have been pretty hard for them to write a movie that didn't end up just being a Christian missionary type film if they got those facts right. They could have probably been subtle enough and just said something about believing in Jesus, but I get it, it's Hollywood. <br/><br/>And I get that it is a comedy made by non-Christians, I'm just a little biased ha-ha... If this movie makes anyone think about their future, I hope that instead of inspiring people to be good people, like the movie portrays will help you, it inspires people to talk to a Christian or read the bible and find out what it really says."
"anthonysoussou","6","0","2","10 July 2013"," Apocalypse Farce
","Beyond the comedy that can be expected from laughing in the face of an imaginary survival situation, the jokes are entirely consistent with the typical roles of each of the actors in their other movies. They play themselves in the film, so if you don't like Seth Rogen's jokes in any of his other movies, chances are that you won't like him here either. If you do think that Jonah Hill's aggressive sarcasm and Craig Robinson's ironically-timid big-black-man attitude, then you will definitely laugh your way through.<br/><br/>Don't be fooled by the trailer. Unfortunately, most of the celebrities that aren't in the main group of 5-6 actors don't have much screen time."

","My Girlfriend and I went to see this comedy and loved it. So, what's so special about this movie? It makes you LAUGH! Most comedies rely on sex or nudity -both of which I have NO problem with to get your interest but, they should be called ""Popcorn Porn"" instead of ""comedy"". This is a comedy. From start to finish, it was hysterical, honest, and worth the money. As time goes on, things are costing more and more. What a tremendous disappointment when you spend 40 bucks for tickets, soft drinks and snacks, only to walk out angry or at least, let down. Many of today's movies are re-runs of old plots. This was original and smart. All actors were at their best, relaxed and seemed to have as much fun as the audience. Another thing I need to point out before I finish, is both of us are over 50! We had a great time, got a contact high form the gang and would ""Highly"" recommend it to any who enjoy humor as it's supposed to be- FUNNY!"
"Aaron1375","6","0","4","2 July 2013"," Images in this movie will stay with me always
","Comedies in general can be one of the toughest movie forms to create. This is due to the fact everybody almost has their own sense of humor. When I saw the trailers for this movie, I thought perhaps that this was a comedy that I would enjoy and not be disappointed by at the theater. Basically, I usually go to a comedy and end up disappointed. I was disappointed by Me, Myself and Irene, Nutty Professor II and Austin Powers: Goldmember just to name a few. I was disappointed by this one too, sadly. It had its moments and there was a stretch when I thought this film was taking off and it was going to be a comedy that I would enjoy, but it just kind of lost the sizzle and began to fizzle for me. Though I see by the score and by the fact it is probably going to eclipse the 100 million mark that it has an audience, that audience just did not really include me and the group I went with.<br/><br/>The story is promising to a degree. Buddies Jay and Seth reunite at the airport, planning on spending some time together (all the actors in this are playing versions of themselves, I cannot believe they are exactly like they are portrayed here though) and Seth ends up getting Jay to reluctantly go to a party at James Franco's house. While getting smokes things begin to unravel as some sort of apocalyptic event is taking place. Jay and Seth race back to Franco's house and along with Jonah Hill, Craig Robertson and later Danny McBride, the group of friends tries to hold out for rescue as the world around them is falling apart.<br/><br/>The premise was good, and while I thought the film started slowly, once the world began coming unraveled I thought the film was going to be a pretty funny movie. I laughed at them kicking around a person's head and I enjoyed watching Danny McBride waste supplies. However, at a certain point the film became somewhat of a bore to me. I did not like the whole revelations direction they took. I wanted to see a group of celebrities and their reactions to destruction all around them. When the film was doing this it was pretty funny, but once they started having one on one conversations and the jokes started being just the fact there was a penis on screen it just lost it. It also ended in weak fashion too, I thought they would do something a lot better for the grand finale. I will also never be able to watch a Channing Tatum movie and think of him the same again after this film.<br/><br/>So, for me, it had some moments. It was not a bad movie, just not my type of film. I give them props for doing something different, but at the same time I deduct points for them using a special effects laden finale. However, once again this is a comedy meaning while I did not like the film, you may very well laugh through the entire thing. I mean, I laugh a lot during an episode of MST3K, but a lot of people simply look confused, unsure as to what I am finding so funny. So read the reviews or see the movie for yourself...it may be your cup of tea. I, on the other hand, hope that the other apocalyptic comedy coming out in August will be a comedy I will enjoy at the theater."

I must admit some of the interpretation of hell was too close to being real. This Is the End made me wonder what hell is like? What the apocalypses well be like? The movie is cheesy and stupid.

One prime issue that I had was that none of the characters were very likable, but I suppose they really weren't meant to be. Depending on your sense of humor, I'd either suggest this or tell you to stay as far away from it as possible.

","Jonah Hill: ""This is no dream! This is really happening!""<br/><br/>Well, not really happening, but five well-known actors play amplified versions of themselves (e.g., Seth Rogen, Jay Baruchel, Jonah Hill, Danny McBride, and James Franco) with their well-known character traits at a housewarming party at Franco's. Soon the Apocalypse is upon them as they struggle with some impressive monsters to survive.<br/><br/>The laughs are vulgar, sometimes sexual, sometimes scatological, and sometimes funny. Otherwise it seems like a movie made by guys who have made it and think we will enjoy them hanging out and being amusing during the end of the world. In other words, although they are not funny most of the time, because of their celebrity we should consider them funny all of the time. <br/><br/>The narcissism we have come to suspect of successful Hollywood actors is both a source of the film's humor and its satire. The joke, of course, is on us because we have paid well to see them act like adolescents.<br/><br/>The horror film sequences are not bad graphically and dramatically, with less humor than in the quieter parts such as when Rogen and Baruchel ride from the airport reminding me of Jerry Seinfeld's Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee. Although I have to admit Jonah Hill as a green-eyed, liquid spewing Exorcist knock off is funny enough if you just consider his many schlubby roles. During his exorcism, this exchange is mildly humorous: Jay Baruchel: ""The power of Christ compels you!"" Jonah Hill: ""Guess what? It's not that compelling."" <br/><br/>I'd say for a tepid comedic summer, This is the End ranks above Hangover III and below The Internship. You won't split a gut over it, but you will not waste your money either. And if the end of the world occurs at the same time, you could have done worse."
