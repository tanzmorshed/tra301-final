","It may be true that everyone during their lifetime has fifteen minutes of fame, even if in most cases it only lasts about a minute and a half.  And if that minute and a half comes early in life, how far into adulthood can you carry it with you, and when does a healthy memory become an obsession that finally blurs the line between reality and fantasy?  `The Fan,' directed by Tony Scott and starring Robert De Niro and Wesley Snipes, is an intense and disturbing motion picture that examines that moment and the effects it can have on the lives of those either directly or indirectly involved.  Here, the focus is on one Gil Renard (De Niro), a knife salesman in San Francisco and a die-hard Giants fan who is pumped about the acquisition during the off-season of superstar centerfielder Bobby Rayburn (Snipes), whom he believes will bring a pennant to the team.  Once a player himself-- a pitcher-- Renard's life has since been on a downhill slide.  Divorced, he has a young, little league aged son, Richie (Andrew J. Ferchland), with whom he has an unsettling relationship, and at work, his sales have been so poor his job is on the line.  An angry, disturbed individual, Renard has reached a pivotal point in his life; for inspiration, he continually returns to the philosophies of the catcher from his playing days, Coop (Charles Hallahan), whom he considers one of the finest athletes he ever knew.  And as his life continues to deteriorate, his obsessions begin to add further to the imbalance of his perceptions of reality, which finally lead him past a point of no return.<br/><br/>	Scott's film, of course, has less to do with baseball than it does with how the game itself actually relates to life and the things that really matter. As Rayburn says at one point, `We're not curing cancer here.'  But to those to whom life has been reduced to that minute and a half to which they still cling, the game can be everything.  And it is just that unhealthy obsession that Scott examines in this film, that comparatively insignificant moment that in the obsessive mind becomes an episode of monumental importance that finally distorts any semblance of reality the individual may have left. What's truly frightening is that upon close scrutiny, in Renard there is much with which many viewers will be able to relate in one way or another: The anger, the frustration and perhaps the inability to let go of that minute and a half, even when it threatens to become more than just a pleasant memory, but an unhealthy lifeline to another place and another time that, in reality, may never have existed in the first place.  It's like a search for self-esteem by the has-been-who-never-was, who can neither realize nor accept it's elusiveness.  As Renard says to Richie, `Baseball is better than life, because it's fair.  You hit a sacrifice fly and it doesn't count against your average.'  An ideal that has forever eluded Renard; in his life, he's never been able to `give himself up for the team' and get anything in return for it.<br/><br/>	As Renard, De Niro gives an explosive performance that at first glance may seem to have a bit of Travis Bickle and Max Cady in it-- which in fact it does-- though upon closer inspection, Renard is a unique character.  Those with a disturbed mind may have traits in common, as these characters De Niro has portrayed certainly do; but De Niro has successfully given each of them an individual personality, and when viewed side by side, the differences are readily apparent.  Bickle may be a sociopath, Cady a cold blooded killer; but Renard is a man who was just never able to get a handle on his life and has allowed his obsessions to dictate the choices he has made along the way. De Niro is simply a master of his craft, with the ability to make his characters so real that a performance like this one is often overlooked; this is Oscar worthy work for which he never received the acclaim he was due.  His Renard is so like someone you would run into in your everyday life that in retrospect, it's scary.  But it's the kind of performance we've come to expect from De Niro, and as usual, he does not disappoint.<br/><br/>	Wesley Snipes, as well, gives a solid performance as Rayburn that is one of his best ever, which is not surprising when you consider with whom he was working.  If you study De Niro's films, you may discover a common thread running through them with regard to his co-stars.  De Niro has the ability to make those with whom he is working better; and it's something that stays with them forever after.  Consider Christopher Walken and Meryl Streep before `The Deer Hunter,' or Ed Harris before `Jacknife.'  Certainly they were exceptional talents before, but they have arguably been better since. And Snipes is no exception.  Nor is Benicio Del Toro (Recipient of the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for `Traffic'), who gives a memorable turn here as Rayburn's rival outfielder, Juan Primo.  <br/><br/>	The supporting cast includes Patti D'Arbanville (Ellen),Ellen Barkin (Jewel), John Leguizamo (Manny), Chris Mulkey (Tim), Dan Butler (Garrity) and Brandon Hammond (Sean).  A thought provoking thriller that gives some real insight into the cause and effect of the psyche of human nature, `The Fan' is like an open wound that may hit too close to home for some.  And to dismiss this as just a `baseball' movie or another `action' flick would be a mistake, for there is much more here than meets the eye.  In the end, those who pay attention will ultimately reap the rewards it proffers.  I rate this one 9/10."

","This movie wasn't as bad as everyone says. I think it's safe to say that I am a fan of Robert De Niro, and that will certainly help if you like Robert De Niro to enjoy this movie. But I didn't enjoy this movie solely on the fact that I like De Niro, I thought Snipes gave an equally choice performance. The thrills in this movie were small, but they were satisfying. The ending is, without a doubt, the best part. There were other good thrills though, like the freezer scene.<br/><br/> I must say that I liked this movie a good deal. Its is not without its flaws, but in order to enjoy this movie, and a lot of other movies for that matter, you must look past the flaws, and just take it for what it is. Enjoy this movie for its handful of thrills, decent acting, and great music (I am a big fan of the Rolling Stones also). This is a good no-brainer with a creepy overtone, so just watch it for its pros, not its cons. 8/10"
"bkoganbing","8","19","24","29 November 2008"," It's Just A Game
","Although The Fan has a baseball setting with the late Candlestick Park in San Francisco, it's not a baseball story. It's the dual story of a fan obsessed with baseball and his favorite player and that same player and his performance anxiety living up to the huge amount of money the Giants are paying him.<br/><br/>The title role is played by Robert DeNiro and a lot of his character is taken from what Michael Douglas had earlier did in Falling Down. DeNiro is the son of the founder of the company he works for, but dad having passed away long ago, the company is in different hands. DeNiro is not cutting it as a salesman of hunting knives (no pun intended) and he's having problems with his former wife Patty D'Arbanville-Quinn over visitation with his son.<br/><br/>At the same time multi-million dollar acquisition Wesley Snipes is having problems living up to the hype and he's looking like a big old bust. Especially next to new Giant sensation Benicio DelToro who is carrying the team with what looks like a Most Valuable Player season. Snipes is only doing well on one front, his relationship with his young son.<br/><br/>As his life falls apart DeNiro starts fixating on his favorite player and what he can do to help motivate him. After that this film gets truly bizarre. <br/><br/>But DeNiro who probably has more disturbed characters under his creative belt than any other actor around today keeps it all real. He's matched by Wesley Snipes who plays a Barry Bonds like superstar who gets a good life lesson by the end of the film.<br/><br/>In fact Snipes realizes it before the film ends. As he quite realistically says, it's just a game, it's not like we're out there discovering a cure for cancer. The problem is that there are too many out there, fans like DeNiro in sports and in show business who get way too caught up in it.<br/><br/>Look also for nice performances by Ellen Barkin who has a sports phone-in show and John Leguizamo as Snipes's agent and the wisest guy he has around him."
"DarthVoorhees","9","18","23","23 November 2007"," Underrated. DeNiro plays another great S.O.B
","The Fan is the polar opposite of Field of Dreams and I loved it. Baseball movies have no spine to them whatsoever, they tend to all ways follow the same Pride of the Yankees formula where Baseball is a fraternal sport in which everything is okay. The Fan digs deeper.<br/><br/>Robert DeNiro plays Gil Bernard an odd knife salesman who loses the visitation rights to be with his son. Bernard vents his rage by following his San Francisco Giants religiously. Gil becomes obsessed with Bobby Rayburn, the Giants' new top paid center fielder. Rayburn believes in jinxes and wants his lucky jersey number back to end a slump. Gil gets it for him by killing his teammate. Gil confronts Rayburn who says his change of luck was due to his not caring anymore. Gil goes berserk and threatens to kill Rayburn's son if he doesn't due a Babe Ruth and hit a homer for him.<br/><br/>DeNiro represents the Fan who turns to MLB as an escape from real life. His Gil is a tragic character who only lives for the game and focuses on what he could have been and what he wants to force his son to become. We don't necessarily agree with him but we can better see what makes this villain tick.<br/><br/>Snipes Rayburn isn't a bad guy but he like the A-Rod's of day let's the fame get to his head. He undergoes a perspective change through the film as he questions what the game means to him.<br/><br/>The Fan is a great dark satire of baseball. We see all the aspects that are there but are so often ignored. The greed of the players and their agents, the sports writers eager to sink their teeth into the slumping hitter, and the fathers who try to pressure their children to live their athletic dreams through them.<br/><br/>My one complaint about the film is it's ending. It just seems far too over the top and unrealistic. Gil shouldn't have received that much attention at his death, it should have been a private confrontation between him and Rayburn."
"EmpressR","7","15","19","4 August 2000"," Not a perfect film, but I enjoyed it
","While I agree with some of the previous comments about the lack of attention to detail and the confusing cinematography, I really did enjoy this movie. The story itself is not particularly original and the ending is weak -- but I thought the build-up of Gil's (De Niro) character to be quite effective. Although Gil was what one would typically label a loser, I couldn't help but feel for the guy.  Many movies about psychos/stalkers fail to give you any insight into why he's doing all these bad things -- all you know is that he's not a nice guy.  This movie did a great job of portraying how Gil's volatile personality, his obsession with the baseball and with Bobby (Snipes) in particular, and his loss of everything else that mattered to him, ultimately led him to do what he did."
"jotix100","6","8","9","8 April 2008"," Death of a salesman
","Gil Renard's passion for baseball consumes him. In fact, the sport he loves seems to get the best of him. His own marriage has failed dismally; he is involved in an acrimonious divorce and his son seems to have taken to the new man in his mother's life. Gil, who is a sporting knives salesman, has problems with his clients to the point that his boss has no other alternative than to get rid of him.<br/><br/>What is Gil supposed to do? When his idol, Bobby Rayburn is hired for the San Francisco Giants, as an outfielder, Gil feels his team will have a chance for the pennant. His obsession will get the best of him. He even tries to influence another player into switching uniform numbers with his new idol. When all that fails, Gil decides to take a different path and ends up stalking Rayburn with terrible consequences.<br/><br/>""The Fan"", directed by Tony Scott starts on an upbeat note. The film based on a Peter Abrahams book we didn't read, with a screenplay by Phoef Sutton, plays well until it has Gil Renard going nuts when his whole world crumbles.<br/><br/>Robert Deniro, under Mr. Scott's direction, does what he can to the script that has him playing the deranged Gil in ways that doesn't help the film. It's fun to watch Mr. Deniro impersonating Gil Renard, whose passion for the American pastime ruins his life. We get a hint of how he got involved in the sport at the end of the movie. Wesley Snipes makes one of the best appearances of his career. In minor roles we see a wasted Ellen Barkin, Benicio del Toro and John Leguizamo, among others.<br/><br/>This is a film for Mr. Deniro's fans."
"SnoopyStyle","5","10","12","7 November 2013"," Too much flash from Tony Scott
","Gil Renard (Robert De Niro) is a failing knife salesman, a SF Giants fanatic, a divorced father of a boy, and a very angry guy. Bobby Rayburn (Wesley Snipes) is a new sign to the ball club, and the hope for savior. Both men's lives go downhill.<br/><br/>Director Tony Scott has made a movie filled with flash and sizzle. It doesn't accentuate as much as distract. When there is a master thespian like Robert De Niro, all the extra fireworks just take the focus away from the real show. And Wesley Snipes isn't likable enough. A less stereotypical selfish black athlete may help. His scenes with his agent Manny (John Leguizamo) are annoying and tiresome. This could have been a creepy character study like the iconic 'Taxi Driver'. But it never allows De Niro any peace and quiet to do his work properly."
"anthonythe","10","16","21","11 April 2006"," An underrated gem!
","The film centres around Gil (De Niro), an obsessive baseball fan who puts his beloved New York Giants and particularly their new star player Bobby Rayburn (Snipes) above everything else in life. When Rayburn's below par performances have fans and pundits calling for him to be dropped however in favour of rival Juan Primo (Benicio Del Toro) , his number one fan is determined to do whatever it takes to get him back on top....<br/><br/>De Niro shows just why he is one of the best actors around (despite his latest chequebook acting efforts) with this performance as the single minded, baseball obsessive Gill. The character is just as memorable as the menacing Max Cady in Cape Fear and its says something for De Niro who can go from playing psychotic scumbags to green comatose patient (Awakenings) with ease. Snipes puts in a solid performance as the luckless Baseball player with the burden of a huge transfer fee and season of glory resting on his shoulders along with Benicio del Toro as his cocky rival hitter but this is De Niro's film and he does the bad-guy-you-side-with down to a tee! Rent it out now!!!"
"Geofbob","6","28","41","30 April 2001"," De Niro makes it all worthwhile (just)
","A flawed movie,  but worth seeing for De Niro's performance as Gil Renard, an increasingly crazed fan/stalker. Also, yet again, baseball shows itself as the sport most able to provide striking visual metaphors for the ups and downs of life (though, as a Brit, I've noted some of the specific criticisms aimed at the baseball sequences in this movie by IMDb commenters from the US).<br/><br/>Where the movie, via the genius of De Niro, certainly succeeds is in convincingly demonstrating how easily and quickly obsessive devotion can turn to obsessive hatred, when the object of that devotion fails to meet the assumptions of the extreme fan. Certainly, there's some of Max Cady, the Cape Fear psychotic, in his portrayal; but there's also a lot of Rupert Pupkin, the confused kidnapper and would-be comic from King of Comedy - both films, of course, directed by Martin Scorsese.<br/><br/>Where the film fails is in being too repetitive and, consequently, a bit too long; one or two of the scenes where Gil is trying to sell his knives are superfluous; and, when Gil is at the game with his son, why does the camera have to keep cutting to the woman in the crowd - once or twice would have been sufficient. Several of the scenes also seem derivative, especially those involving Dan Butler, as Garitty the sales manager, which echo Glengarry Glen Ross. A major unconvincing aspect is that surely a $40m signing, like Bobby Raybourn (Wesley Snipes), would be surrounded by a lot more razzmatazz than simply one not-too-effective agent (John Leguizamo).<br/><br/>But, on the whole, one to rent or watch on TV (as I've just done) if nothing more compelling is available."

","***SPOILERS*** Robert De Niro is at his deranged and psychotic best as the crazed baseball fanatic or fan for short Gil Renard a man completely whacked out of his skull. It's Gil who takes matters into his own hands when his hero the just traded to the San Francisco Giants, from the Atlanta Braves, Bobby Rayburn, Wesley Snipes, gets the short end of the stick by the teams management. That's by Bobby not being able to retain his number #11 on his Giants jersey that he feels made him a,.314 lifetime hitter, his supernatural powers in both hitting and catching a baseball.<br/><br/>Gil has his own problems at work and at home with his job as a sport supply executive specializing in hunting knives on the line and his old lady Ellen, Patti D'Arbanville, about to get complete custody of their seven year old son Richie,Andrew J. Ferchlad. But it's baseball,not job or family, that's Gil's true love. And it's in Bobby Rayburn that Gil a former little league baseball pitcher lives out his fantasy life as a major league baseball player. That's in Gil doing in Juan Primo, Beniclo De Toro, with a hunting knife in a hotel bath-house to get Bobby's number #11 back on his Giants jersey. Bobby the 40 million dollar man, that's what the Giants higher ups were paying him, who was in a king size slump all season now, with Primo gone and his famed #11 back, started hitting up to expectations.<br/><br/>It's later on when Gil just happened to be around to save Bobby's eight year old son Sean, Brandon Hammond, from almost drowning in the Pacific Ocean that his high opinions about Bobby drastically changed. Invited into Bobby's beach house for a bottle of beer and a game of pool, which is the least he could do for him, Gil is disgusted in Bobby's opinion about the game of baseball! Which Bobby treats as a game and way to make big bucks, 40 million of them, not the religion that Gil feel that it is! With everything that he did to get Bobby back in the grove in both hitting and fielding, by murdering his top rival on the team Juan Primo, Gil feels that he's not being given him the credit by Bobby, who has no idea what Gil did for him, that he so rightfully deserves. And with that and outraged and dejected Gil plans to make Bobby's life both personal and professional into a living hell on earth!<br/><br/>***SPOILERS*** The movie ""The Fan"" is really a one man show with Robert De Niro at center stage doing his thing, being off the wall crazy, that he and only he can do best. Not only is De Niro or Gil Renard completely out of his mind but also omnipresent, like some kind of Deity, in seeming to be everywhere and everyplace at the same time. Gil's craziness goes so far as kidnapping Bobby's son Sean and even going farther in murdering his little league hero, his battery mate, Coop, Charles Hallahan, when he himself realized just how crazy Gil his one time best friend really was.<br/><br/>The ending of the movie was a bit too much to take with Gil going all out to get Bobby to publicly acknowledge what he did for him in front of a sold out crowd at Candlestick Park and on top of all that hit a home run for him! If not Bobby's son Sean would become history. The film fell apart with Candlestick Park being hit by hurricane force winds with a tropical downpour added in yet the game that should have been called because of rain is still allowed to go on. Only to have Gil make his grand appearance, you'll never guess as who, out of nowhere and mess up Bobby's home run that he hit for him! Still the film is worth watching for Roert De Niro incredible but very natural,for him, performance. A so out of control and psychotic performance That even tops De Niro's own crazed and deranged interpretation of a homicidal lunatic gone wild in ""Cape Fear"" some six years earlier."
"pc95","2","6","8","14 February 2010"," Awful Pointless Spin on Psycho Movies
","One of the worst movies I've ever seen with Robert De Niro, The Fan is a pointless clichÃ© of an exercise in slasher flicks. It tries to spin or twist the genre with preposterous plot lines of a a crazed fan turned psychotic - the movie meanders into nothing. (spoiler) We're to believe that a knife-wielding idiot has access to and murders a baseball player in a lavish hotel with no witness, security, or cameras? The movie is nonsense trying to tug at our heart-strings through the hoopla of baseball ending up mockingly unsophisticated and gimmicky. Not sure what all the actors were thinking when they got onboard this razzie. This is as big a dud as they come. Stay far away if you prefer thought in your movies"
"lookydook1","1","12","20","17 August 2008"," No ""Fan""s in this movie..
","*MANY MANY SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW* This movie was horrible. I am a huge baseball fan so I thought I'd watch it, and I was very disappointed. It started out okay.. When I saw the bad influence DeNiro had on his young son, I was hoping that he would become a better father throughout the movie or something. Anyways, at the beginning it seemed as if DeNiro was supposed to be the protagonist. He was the only one that believed in Bobby, and he had his adorable son that he was losing custody of, which gave me a reason to feel bad for him. He wanted to help Bobby by talking to Primo, when out of absolutely nowhere he brutally stabs Primo to death... Not to mention that sketchy reoccurring song ""I WANT TO **** YOU!!!!"" at random unfitting moments.<br/><br/>Later, when DeNiro saves Bobby's son from drowning, I was hoping that the movie could redeem itself.. He could forgive himself for killing Primo if he saved Bobby's son. But of course this is far beyond the depth of the movie, because all he cares about is getting CREDIT for the murder, and does so by stealing Bobby's son, car, and dog and holding them hostage- Bobby just has to hit a home run and announce that DeNiro is a ""true fan"" while displaying a picture of him biting a knife.<br/><br/>Now we get to the completely unrealistic scene at the end... It is pouring like hell and we are expected to believe that the game hasn't been called. Then DeNiro somehow magically appears on the field in an umpire suit and calls Bobby out at home, proceeding to pull out his knife and start stabbing everyone that runs onto the field. There are seemingly no officers on the field (but the police are on their way), so DeNiro steps on the mound and prepares to pitch a knife to Bobby when he gets shot to death. But don't worry, this cheerful and pleasant movie has a happy ending, because Bobby find his son.<br/><br/>This is NOT a sports movie. It is NOT about a fan. As far as I know, fans are not rabid psychopaths that threaten, rob, and throw knives at their admirees. This is likely to be the sickest movie I will ever see in my life. The plot was shallow, the soundtrack sucked, the movie had no purpose whatsoever. I warn you not to waste your time on this disgusting excuse for a film."
"DuckFan","3","12","20","29 August 2002"," Disappointing
","What a bad movie.  I'm really surprised that DeNiro and even Snipes would be associated with something like this.  If you're going to make a movie that involves baseball, and shows scenes of baseball, at least make the action look somewhat realistic.  Why was the crowd always standing up for no particular reason during games?  ***POSSIBLE SPOILER***  And the last scene in the movie....what was that?  We are somehow led to believe that DeNiro has found his way onto the field in an umpire's uniform, and that the game is even being played in a torrential downpour....one of the worst ever scenes in a sports movie.  3 stars out of 10."

","I don't agree at all with the person who said 'Films like ""The Fan"" come a dime a dozen.' This movies storyline is like no other that I know of. Great camera shots, catchy dialogue and well placed music make the movie all the more interesting the whole way. Robert DeNiro delivers superbly in his role as an extremely obsessive baseball fan, and as all DeNiro fans love and know that in many of his movies he delivers great lines with his powerful facial expressions that makes you intense with anticipation. And in this movie you get great up close shots of Robert DeNiro as he says his lines unlike most of his other films. Supporting actors such as John Leguiziamo and Benicio Del Toro deliver very well each in his own unique roles. This movie was really good in every single way I can think of, very well put together. Wesley Snipes does great in a different role as a father and baseball star, other than him usually being the butt kicking hero of the movie. Overall if you enjoy any Robert DeNiro movie this is a must."

"ga41","6","4","5","19 October 2004"," Similar to king of comedy
","Is it just me or does this film share so many of the aspects that the King of Comedy made over ten years earlier? Both of De Niros characters are losers who have a dream, both are unlucky in love, both have short tempers when pushed, both have obvious disorders within their mind and both are obsessive 'fans' of bobby rayburn and jerry langford, respectively. Stalking and kidnapping occurs in each film by De Niro, of his respective hero but neither hero actually gets hurt. Though in the King of comedy he is funnier and probably a nicer guy!"
"oldsaurora","8","10","17","9 July 2003"," De Niro steals the show!
","The Worst Baseball Movie of All-Time?  I don't know how anyone can say this with a straight face if they have also seen Major League.<br/><br/>It's true that the ending of this film is pretty bad, but when a film can do so much right for the first two hours that certainly makes it worthwhile, because the first two hours were truly entertaining.  De Niro stole the show, he had to because this move was about ""The Fan"", but each character was played well.<br/><br/>Most of the criticisms I've seen are a case of people being way too picky. Wrong uniforms, wrong stadiums...I didn't even notice stuff like this and I am a baseball fan too.  The film got a lot of the much more important stuff right, which is good performances from the actors and good, no great, character development and insight into these characters.<br/><br/>The film took us into deep the mind of the obsessed fan (De Niro) and that obsession grows in a logical fashion as the movie progresses.  It was very easy to believe De Niro's obsession with Rayburn and the game of baseball, and the rationale for it, because of his unstable and violent nature which is often shown in his personal life.  When things in the baseball world weren't going as he wanted them, it's not surprising to see him take action. His passion and intensity were on the front burner all movie long and made his character truly believeable and consistent.<br/><br/>The film takes us into the baseball player culture in the lockeroom, and into the workings of player and agent (which is what I really found interesting), as well as player and radio station personality.  This is where the film truly excelled: the inner workings of the mind and the baseball player culture were believable and exceptionally well done. Nothing was made silly or outrageous, like in the aforementioned dud ""Major League"".  Well, except for the ending perhaps, which is where this film loses 2 points.<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>My first De Niro movie, definitely not my last."
"zacdawac","9","10","18","26 August 2002"," Probably the most underrated De Niro film of all time!
","This is KING OF COMEDY meets TAXI DRIVER, with a bit of CAPE FEAR, THIS BOY'S LIFE, and BANG THE DRUM SLOWLY thrown in for flavor. I can't imagine why the critics panned this film, because it takes you to unexplored territory, it's filled with rich, complex characters, and the story is gripping and believable from beginning to end. I definitely put THE FAN in the top ten De Niro films, and place it levels above anything else that he's done since the early nineties. If Rupert Pupkin had been obsessed with baseball, rather than Jerry Lewis, and if he'd had Tarvis Bickle's hatred for humanity and Dwight Hanson's anger and hostility, then he would have been Gil Renard. Lot's of surprising twists, and absolutely classic last words from Coup."
"AskewNerd","Null","8","14","6 December 2004"," surprise! it doesn't suck
","I had every expectation of this film being terrible and mearly a paycheck for De Niro. But, it was great. Snipes and Del Toro are fantastic. De Niro is scary as hell as well. There was not one explosion in the entire film. That was great. Short, to the point fight scenes. That's all you need in a suspense thriller. It was much smarter than expected. The plot never made you feel sorry for De Niro. The idea of him being a sad stoned cold man was there. But, not dwelled upon. The focus was on his obsession with the game of baseball and that became more important. Snipes had his entire sideline story that eventually involved De Niro.

","I just saw THE INTERN yesterday, and it really wasn't half bad. But the whole time I was watching Robert De Niro playing the sweet, kind intern, drying Anne Hathaway's tears and so on, I kept thinking about a movie called THE FAN.<br/><br/>THE FAN was meant to be a scorching suspense thriller, full of De Niro at his most menacing and insane. But really it came across as far more funny than THE INTERN. I mean, just think about the main character. He's ""an insane knife salesman."" That's a character we meet all the time in real life, of course. A traveling knife salesman. Who's insane.<br/><br/>De Niro traveling door to door, selling knives, is a funny idea by itself. De Niro telling delusional tales of ""partying"" with Mick Jagger is a really, really funny idea. Mick Jagger and De Niro in the same universe is funny, let alone in the same room. Partying together. Till dawn.<br/><br/>So then, because the story is so realistic so far, they add a bizarre fantasy element. This rich, black, baseball superstar somehow decides that he needs to befriend a small-time knife salesman who's clearly insane. Because that's what superstars do, see. They wander the land, befriending the insane. <br/><br/>And then they party till dawn."

","Knife salesman Gil Renard is a die-hard baseball fan and is looking forward to Opening Day more than normal as his team, the San Fransisco Giants, have acquired Bobby Rayburn - a 3-time MVP - from the Atlanta Braves. However, not long into the season, Rayburn's form goes downhill fast, and he starts to fall out with his teammates, especially the on-form Juan Primo. Gil decides to try and ""help"" Rayburn any way he can even if it means taking things a bit too far, but when he's not given the credit he thinks he deserves after Rayburn starts hitting again, Gil takes matters into his own hands after a ""chance"" meeting with Rayburn.<br/><br/>Whether you like psychological thrillers, are a fan of De Niro or Snipes, or all of the above, The Fan is definitely a must-see kind of movie. The story's not intricate nor deeply complex, but it doesn't need to be when it's told & delivered as good as this.<br/><br/>The film's cast is excellent...De Niro, Snipes, Leguizamo, Del Toro all do a fantastic job, but the master is definitely De Niro and he's at his psychotic best once again. The way he portrays Gil going on a steady downward spiral deeper into insanity is fantastic and scarily realistic. Snipes also does a good job of playing cocky Rayburn, which isn't too far off how a lot of players see themselves.<br/><br/>The Nine Inch Nails soundtrack of ""Closer"" is used to great effect and really adds to atmosphere of Gil's descent into madness. I've seen people moaning about the lack of ""realism"" regarding the game of baseball in this movie also. How many action movies have we seen where the ""hero"" gets shot at 1000s of times but doesn't get hit once? Or all those James Bond moments when he's in trouble? People still enjoy them though. Yes, some of it's not realistic e.g. playing the game in a torrential downpour, but if you want ""realism"" regarding baseball then go and watch a documentary about the game. This is a film for entertainment...not education, so just enjoy it for what it is."

","So sad to see the talents of Robert De Niro and Wesley Snipes go to waste. Anything for a buck I guess. The theme is plausible enough, but the editing of the film makes jumps in logic that just can't be. We see De Niro as a driven hot headed knife salesman, as a stalker, as a baseball has been and a derelict dad. How much worse can he be? Wesley Snipes is a mythic baseball player, loving father, superstitious superstar and must endure the fan wrath of a new city. Guess what happens? Duh. And to top it all off, it's boring. Even to a huge baseball fan like myself. Go to a bad restaurant instead and get food poisoning, you'll feel better about the time you spent."

","It never ceases to amaze me how you can take an excellent actor, and put him to waste in a film such as this.  Robert De Niro is one of the best Hollywood stars of all time, but even he couldn't save this movie.  In fact, his character is much the same as the one he played in Cape Fear, which was actually pretty good, but I can't stand it when actors do the same schtick over more than one movie.  I believe it gets old, and that is the case here.<br/><br/>There's nothing surprising in this movie, but then, the story has been told a million times before.  Wesley Snipes is your typical baseball player, and his conceit shows through in his characterization.  De Niro plays the obsessed fan, but his role in this film is less than entertaining.<br/><br/>However, because De Niro is IN this film, that makes it a draw if you are a fan (no pun intended) who sees everything he does no matter how bad.  But to see De Niro at his best, see ""Midnight Run"", ""Goodfellas"", or ""Cop Land"", or even go way back and check out ""Taxi Driver"" or ""Godfather II"".

","In THE FAN Robert De Niro plays Gil Renard . Or is it Travis Bickle ? or Rupert Pupkin ? Or Max Cady ?

I found it slightly difficult to believe that Renard would have started out as a frustrated obsessive sports fan into being an out and out psycho<br/><br/>The character arc isn't the only problem with this script - It also lacks a character focus ( A problem I had with THE UNTOUCHABLES where De Niro should have been superb but ended up slightly flat ) , for several stretches of the movie I kept thinking that Bobby Rayburn was the main character then the story switches back to Renard . It also seems to have disappointed a lot of sports fans who seem to think this should have concentrated a bit more on baseball . I'm not sure if this was meant to appeal to baseball fans originally but again there are elements which hint it might have if the producers had made up their minds has to who and what the story should focus upon <br/><br/>I will admit I was entertained by THE FAN ( Especially by the soundtrack ) but it is a very flawed film and it should be remembered that by the mid 1990s characters being stalked by nutters as in SINGLE WHITE FEMALE , UNLAWFUL ENTRY etc had run out of steam a long time ago"

And the scene where De NIRO killed the teammate of SNIPES´, PRIMO is also far from credibility. Well, overall it´s a quiet good movie, but don´t expect a really tension-like psycho drama compared to CAPE FEAR, for example.

Robert De Niro teams up with director Tony Scott and Wesley Snipes to make one good thriller. Even though The Fan can't compare with the likes of Tony Scott's previous films, True Romance and Top Gun, it is a still a promising thriller with some pretty big flaws. It is not a masterpiece and nor will it ever be but will be remembered as a movie that tried but could not reach the finish line. The critics were very harsh on this film but that's what they are born to do, criticize on every single piece of work. Five point six is too low for a film like the fan, a six point two would have been more like it. The end is clichéd and ruins the whole point of the film. The movie is predictable yet entertains you a little bit to stop you from taking the disc out. If you are a thriller lover then this movie is no disappointment because it will entertain you.

While the newly signed baseball star is having trouble getting his favorite uniform number from a competitive teammate Juan Primo, Gil is having career troubles at the knife company that his father founded, and people can bet that his proximity to high-quality stainless-steel blades will be a factor in the suspenseful plot. Gil confronts Primo in a sauna and explains to the ballplayer that he believes Rayburn's decline in play is directly the result of Primo's competitiveness, since Rayburn took over Primo's spot at center field, but did not let him use his lucky number of 11 on his jersey. When Primo brushes off the fan's concerns, Gil proceeds to murder the left fielder with one of his makeshift knives!<br/><br/>Wesley Snipes finally gives a exceptional performance and he plays his sport role, Bobby Rayburne, very well and he shows emotion along with many other good feelings. The Fan is not so great that you would rather watch this than Kill Bill because you are a complete retard (No Offense). Robert De Niro plays the die-hard baseball fan who will do anything to impress his favorite baseball player, Bobby Rayburne (Wesley Snipes, and which results in him turning into something sinister and evil. Benicio Del Toro is almost unrecognizable in this film but after catching his face a few times, I finally realized that Benicio Del Toro looks like crap in this film. Jack Black also makes a two-second appearance in this film as the radio station guy. He looks normal and fat, usual. I got this in a triple film-pack which contained Money Train and Unstoppable, so I brought it because it was a good deal. This film deserves a view at least once.

","Watching The Fan, it's difficult,at times,to see beneath its in-your-face presentation and realize what the film is actually about. Since the beginning of the century, America's been obsessed with sports. Just as much as the sports being played, people adore the athletes who play them. I've seen people who literally dedicate every breathing moment of their life to their favorite sports star. Gil Renard, the man at the center of The Fan, is this kind of guy, and then some.<br/><br/>On the surface, the movie can be seen as a two-dimensional thriller about a psychotic baseball nut. You could also say that for every motive this guy has for doing what he does, none of them seem to justify his actions. This kind of bleak criticism seems unfair though, since after taking into context the film's parallel telling of middle class suffering against the fame and fortune of a life in the spotlight, the film begins to transform into a sad story of a man down on his luck.<br/><br/>The film begins with an unusual but effective sequence that has Robert De Niro voicing a poem over a montage of stock baseball footage. With this, we're brought into the down-sliding life of Gil Renard. His career as a knife salesman is nearly coming to an end, his ex-wife is on the verge of taking his son away from him, and he has an appointment scheduled during the San Francisco Giants season opener. But Gil has one thing going for him: center field superstar Bobby Rayburn (Wesley Snipes) has signed a $40 million contract with the Giants. Gil is ecstatic, but as his luck on the field stacks high, his personal life goes tragically downhill.<br/><br/>Soon Gil begins to replace life itself with a fantastic obsession with Rayburn's performance on the field. And when the superstar enters a slump and loses his $40 million worth, Gil takes it upon himself to get his favorite player hitting again, whatever it takes.<br/><br/>For Tony Scott, The Fan marks his first foray into character study, but is only an addition to thrillers on his filmography. Scott isn't exactly the first director I'd expect to take over a project like this, not because he isn't capable of doing a thriller with depth, but because his direction is often too action oriented to devote an audience's attention to the characters. Here though, his style and hyper-kinetic visuals never detract from the story. If anything, Scott puts an interesting spin on things that make them more effective than they would without him.<br/><br/>De Niro is used to playing this kind of character by now. Since the seventies, he's played psychotic stalkers to the point of perfection. As Gil, his obsessiveness toward Rayburn feels more out of desperation than of pure lunacy, thus separating his performance here from the likes of Max Cady in Cape Fear. Snipes, on the other end, hadn't accomplished quite as big a reputation in his role as the Giants slugger, but he puts in a believable performance and looks like he can swing a bat like the real pros.<br/><br/>As opposite ends of the social pipeline, De Niro's blue collar salesman and Snipes' pampered center fielder, and the differences in their lifestyles are what The Fan is actually about. As Gil's life slides down a long slope, Rayburn is treated like a star throughout. Even if his average isn't what the fans want to see. Rayburn's life will never hit as low a point as Renard's. Beyond its thriller like exterior, The Fan is a commentary on sports obsession."

"JamesHitchcock","8","2","3","1 January 2014"," A Gap in Their Lives
","Once during my schooldays our religious education teacher set us an essay on whether we thought that the modern obsession with sport and pop music was due to a ""gap in people's lives"" caused by the decline of organised religion. (One of my classmates started his essay with ""If they're Chelsea fans the only gap in their lives is the one between their ears""- a sentiment calculated to rile the teacher, who was of course a fan of that club). Tony Scott's film does not have much to say about the decline of organised religion, but it does explore the phenomenon of the obsessive sports fan and the possibility that such people may be trying to compensate for other ""gaps in their lives"". <br/><br/>The main character Gil Renard has a lot in common with William Foster, the anti-hero of another mid-nineties film, Joel Schumacher's ""Falling Down"". Like Foster, he is a divorcée who has become bitterly estranged from his ex-wife who is trying to keep him from seeing their one child. (Here a boy, in ""Falling Down"" a girl). Both are unemployed, having been sacked from companies for which they have worked for many years, and both have become disillusioned with modern society as a whole. Foster worked for a defence contractor but was made redundant when the end of the Cold War meant a reduction in American defence spending. Gil is a knife salesman who has been fired because of poor sales figures, but who blames his sacking on the company's cynical policy of deliberately selling low-priced, low-quality products. Gil has some justification for this attitude; the firm was founded by his father, a skilled craftsman and a perfectionist, but its new management takes the view that perfection and principles have no place in business. <br/><br/>Having lost both his job and his family, Gil's one remaining passion is for baseball. He is an obsessive fan of the San Francisco Giants and of the team's star player, Bobby Rayburn. (Gil himself was a talented player in his youth, but never played the game professionally). When Rayburn suffers from a run of poor form, causing the team's fans to boo him, and when rumours start about a developing rift between Rayburn and another Giants' star, Juan Primo, Gil decides it is time to take drastic action. <br/><br/>This is not the first time Robert De Niro has played an obsessive fan. In ""King of Comedy"" his character, Rupert Pupkin, was an aspiring stand- up comedian obsessed with an established comedian. The two films, however, are very different in tone. ""King of Comedy"" is a satirical black comedy; Pupkin may carry out a kidnapping, but his crime is treated in a tongue-in-cheek manner and he remains an amusing, almost endearing, character. (And he manages to have the last laugh even after being sent to jail). ""The Fan"", by contrast, is a serious psychological thriller and Gil's actions are always treated seriously. There are also certain similarities with another De Niro character, again an obsessive loner with a grudge against society, Travis Bickle in ""Taxi Driver"". <br/><br/>In form, ""The Fan"" is a ""deranged stalker"" thriller, following the structure of something like ""Fatal Attraction"" or ""Single White Female"", with Gil as its villain. Yet perhaps it would be more accurate to see him as an anti-hero rather than a straightforward villain. Although he kills two people, and threatens the lives of others, in some ways he is himself a victim, a victim of a court system which treats divorced fathers unfairly and of a business culture which puts a greater premium on profit than on craftsmanship and which treats employees and customers alike with contempt. Even when it comes to his favourite sport, Gil may have some cause for complaint. When he meets Rayburn he becomes disillusioned with his idol's contempt for the fans who pay his wages. Rayburn's insistence that he plays for himself, not for his team's supporters, might seem an admirable attitude in an amateur sportsman; in the case of a professional earning $40 million per annum it just seems like self-indulgence. (Incidentally, was that salary figure a goof or a deliberate exaggeration? Even today no baseball player earns that much; in 1996 the highest paid stars were earning around $10 million).<br/><br/>De Niro made a stellar start to his cinematic career in the seventies and eighties, but since then has not always fulfilled his promise. Perhaps ""Godfather II"" and ""Taxi Driver"" were just too hard an act to follow, or perhaps he has tried to make too many films, not all of which have been of the highest quality. Some of his later films, however, have been excellent ones, and ""The Fan"" is a good example. He gives a spellbinding performance as the manically obsessive Gil, the sort of sports fan who reminds you that the word ""fan"" was originally short for ""fanatic"" and for whom baseball has become more important than life itself. He receives excellent support from Wesley Snipes as Rayburn. <br/><br/>The late Tony Scott never seemed to be as highly regarded by the critics as his brother Ridley, one of the cinema's leading auteurs. Yet in my view Tony's talents were of a rather different sort to his brother's. When he tried to make an auteur-style film with ""The Hunger"", the result was a pretentious mess. His talent lay in making more conventional action thrillers, but in making good ones, often with a certain amount of social comment or political significance involved. ""Crimson Tide"" and ""Enemy of the State"" were two good examples, and ""The Fan"" is another. It is perhaps the best cinematic exploration of the social aspects of spectator sport and the darker side of sporting fandom.

","To talk about the movie as a whole, one has to say right off the topic that this isn't especially great. In fact, it may not even be especially good. It's the story of Gil Renard (Robert De Niro) - a former little league star who never made the majors but who's become a fanatical fan of the San Francisco Giants. Gil is also a knife salesman - and a fading one. His marriage has broken up, he's on the outs with his ex-wife, who eventually gets a restraining order to keep him away from their son after he abandons him at a ball game and then forces his way into their house to apologize. So, he's got a lot of personal problems. The ""fading salesman with problems"" character seems to have more than a little bit in common with characters like Willy Loman in ""Death of a Salesman"" or Shelley Levene in ""Glengarry Glen Ross."" I would guess that both were probably at least a little bit of an influence for Peter Abrahams, who wrote the book on which this was based, and Phoef Sutton, who adapted it as a screenplay.<br/><br/>De Niro is excellent in the part. To draw another parallel, his portrayal as the obsessed, psychotic fan reminded me a bit of his performance as Max Cady in ""Cape Fear."" De Niro has the talent and the presence to pull these kinds of characters off, and to be believable while doing it, which isn't always easy. Renard is both obsessed and psychotic. He becomes particularly obsessed with Bobby Rayburn (Wesley Snipes) - a $40 million free agent signing by the Giants who struggles as the season starts, and gets into a battle with Juan Primo (Benecio del Toro) - who was moved from centre field to left field to make room for Rayburn, but who won't give up Rayburn's favourite #11. While Rayburn slumps, Primo becomes a star. The fans turn against Rayburn and embrace Primo. There's some reflection here on the fickleness of sports fans - the ""what have you done for me lately"" attitude - as well as on the big money that players make. But Gil is on Rayburn's side. He wants Rayburn to succeed - and he becomes obsessed with Rayburn, to the point at which he goes to great lengths to ""help"" him (watch the movie), and then, when Rayburn won't thank him for what he did, he kidnaps the star's son and threatens to kill him unless Rayburn hits a home run in the next game and publicly dedicates it to Gil. That's the story in a nutshell.<br/><br/>Overall, the story isn't that compelling to be honest. Aside from De Niro's performance, which is excellent throughout, there really wasn't a lot to this. It takes a very long time for the movie to really get going. Most of the first hour or so is tied up with Gil's personal troubles with his job and his son. I didn't think we really needed that long to understand that the character is mentally unstable. Snipes tried hard, and he wasn't bad, but his character was less than compelling. He came across as little more than an arrogant, self-centred millionaire ball player until the angle with his son was introduced. There was very little interesting about the character. Some of the baseball action portrayed had problems. To mention something that really stood out for me - every time Rayburn was portrayed coming up to bat, he went to the batters' box from the dugout? Shouldn't he have been in the on deck circle if he was next up? Minor point perhaps, but it bugged me a bit.<br/><br/>The last half hour (once Rayburn's son is kidnapped) is fairly tense; the last scenes on the field are way too over the top unfortunately. So, no, this isn't really a great movie. It's watchable for De Niro's performance. As far as the story is concerned, you really haven't missed much if you haven't seen this. (5/10)"
"Sammy_Sam_Sam","7","2","3","6 September 2006"," Not great, but worth watching for DeNiro alone...
","I watched this film again yesterday for what is probably the fourth or fifth time. Firstly, it's not a great film, so if you demand 9/10 from a movie then this isn't for you. Also, although baseball is a very interesting sport to some, the great majority (particularly outside the US) just don't get it and are not interested in the sport. This undoubtedly will have an affect on some viewers' enjoyment of the film, although you could apply the psychology of it to any sport; it's just that a lot of people would need it to be based on a sport that they enjoy. Fair enough...<br/><br/>Bad bits: The part that Ellen Barkin plays is totally pointless and the film would be better without her. There are a few characters that are slightly annoying because they're playing into steretypes. The way the lead characters drive around in huge SUV's seems to be spot-on though and quite believable, although you have to question just how much Robert DeNiro's character is earning and why he lives in such a dump whilst owning such an expensive vehicle (although it does happen I know). There are a few bits that are difficult to believe, like the ending (it just seems to go a bit too far). But then to me, that's kind of the whole point of this film...<br/><br/>Good bits: It's fun! The ridiculous poem at the beginning sets the scene brilliantly - this is about someone who really cares about something. That doesn't make them an intelligent person, he isn't meant to be; hence the poem is a bad one.<br/><br/>Not every film needs to be ultra realistic. Like for example, why does the boss have a car door sat by the desk? Nobody would ever hold a sales meeting like that! My boss has never so much as spilt his tea or dropped a biscuit in such meetings. If you want this scene in ultra realistic format, watch Alec Baldwin in Glengarry Glenross.<br/><br/>Why don't the police catch De Niro sooner? I don't want to go into details but at the end of the film, you can't help but think that real police procedure might be different (although not being a cop, I couldn't say that with authority). But who cares?! DeNiro is fantastic, fans like him DO exist and this sort of event has taken place before. Plus the music is brilliant, it has some great lines, they don't waste time with a pointless love interest and the film is short and to the point...<br/><br/>If you can accept films with a pinch of salt then you will enjoy this movie. The rating doesn't do it justice and I've seen so many films that are much worse with higher ratings. People who rate it 1/10 just because they don't like baseball should be stopped from reviewing. I don't like baseball, but I love movies!"
"lukystar25","Null","2","3","14 October 2004"," No Ball Player Wants A Fan Like Gil Renard
","Bobby Rayburn (Wesley Snipes), an all-star baseball player who has signed a 40 million dollar deal with the Giants, thinks his life is perfect. What he doesn't know is that he has an overly obsessed fan named Gil Renard (Robert De Niro) who will make his life a living hell. Gil, a knife salesman with a short temper, slowly lets his life fall apart. After losing his job and his kid, he tries to help his favorite player get his reputation back. After all, stalking, killing, and kidnapping are normal things for an obsessive fan to do, right? Obsessive and crazy take a new turn in this edge of your seat drama. For the most part I enjoyed watching this movie. I think some fans are this crazy and know more about an athlete then they are aware of. Robert De Niro plays a great crazy guy, and Wesley Snipes does a great job playing a baseball player who deals with a crazy fan. What I didn't like about this movie is the way that Gil gets into all of this information about Bobby. In real life I didn't think it would be so easy for a fan to get access to where a player lives. He gets access to the bullpen to talk to Bobby on the phone and finds out where #11, another player Juan Primo (Benicio Del Toro), is relaxing at a local spa. How does he do it? He attacks his wife and busts into his house, where she later gets a restraining order and he still shows up at the games and nobody calls the police. Crazy people deserve to be locked up and in this case he doesn't get what he deserves. Watch out all famous athletes--the next psycho stalker fan may be lurking around the corner."

"joachimokeefe","4","1","1","3 April 2018"," The Fan: Review
","Bobby Rayburn (Wesley Snipes) is a $40m, Hummer-driving signing to the Giants baseball team. Gil Renard (Robert DeNiro) is a sales rep for his late father's hunting knife firm. He's also Bobby Rayburn's 'biggest fan', calling in a radio show to defend the price tag that other fans question. Gil, you see, was a Little League Baseball hero, aged 11, and is fixated on Bobby - shades of King Of Comedy.<br/><br/>Gil is also in a bitter divorce, being a psychologically abusive father to his son Richie (AJ Ferchland) and wife Ellen (Patti D'Arbanville). Must be all the knives. On the opening day of the season, Gil takes his son to the game, completely blowing his last chance at keeping his job, but also managing to abandon Richie at the game and to become violent towards Ellen. <br/><br/>Bobby, meanwhile, finds his lucky number 11 is already taken by Juan Primo (Benicio Del Toro), and he has to settle for #33, unless he pays Juan $500k. He then loses his lucky #11 pendant, and despite hitting a home run in the first game, goes into a complete slump.<br/><br/>To cut a long story short, Gil, after failing to persuade Juan to give Bobby his #11, murders Juan in a steam room, and carves his #11 tattoo off his arm (with a hunting knife) to be later placed in Bobby's freezer. Would you believe it, Bobby's slump ends. Gil, who gets away with it, and is now fired as a knife salesman, is very angry indeed that Bobby seems not to be grateful to him for his return to form. At all.<br/><br/>After this, The Fan goes downhill fast. Gil gets nuttier and nuttier - DeNiro melds Travis Bickle, Rupert Pupkin, Kenneth Branagh's Frankenstein and Max Cady, and the whole thing gets into a confused, melodramatic, cliche-ridden mess that wouldn't hold up in an episode of TJ Hooker. I understand that Phoef Sutton, the original screenwriter, doesn't recognise any of this as what he wrote, and thinks Wesley Snipes was miscast. That's the least of what's wrong with it.<br/><br/>We're now expected to believe that Gil, after kidnapping Bobby's son and Hummer, sneaks into the stadium as an umpire with nobody the wiser, let alone that Bobby is fit to play after the night he's had. Directors: if you're depicting a raving nutjob as a master of disguise, your movie's in trouble.<br/><br/>Suffice to say that after what seems a very long, rainy time the Giants, the dog (Bradley) and the kid survive but the old LL baseball buddy Coop (Charles Hallahan) gets his head bashed in, as all old baseball buddies tend to do. Gil comes to a worse end than Bickle and Pupkin did. Not as bad as Cady, though.<br/><br/>Director Tony Scott was English (as I identified till I moved to Scotland) which is why to American tastes, the baseball may be inauthentic, and overcooked for dramatic purposes. However, I can say that I think I now understand it - for which I thank him."

It's almost like the money was spent on something other than making the movie. <br/><br/>I remember this movie as being exceptionally bad to the point where I remembered the name off the top of my head after 20 years. It's really one of those 'Throw away' films. You make it...make money...throw it away. This and 'Snake Eyes' are two of the reasons why I stopped going to movies back in the day.

"Takeshi-K","Null","1","1","22 September 2017"," A brave plunge into obsession.
","The Fan is an excellent thriller directed by British director Tony Scott (True Romance, Top Gun) and stars Robert De Niro and Wesley Snipes. It is an intense and disturbing plunge into the darkness of obsession. Its rated average on this site is far too low to be believed (5.8 at time of writing). I contend that the unhealthy subject matter of obsession cut too close to the bone for many viewers, hindering a more favorable and fairer rating. Perhaps this film held a mirror too close to their own faces. I don't know what they were expecting. Obsession is a common theme in thrillers and for those that can stomach it, please note that it is used in an uncommonly brilliant way here.<br/><br/>Robert de Niro is superb as Gil Renard. Gil's life is on a slow downward spiral. His sales job is under threat and an atrocious relationship with his ex wife threatens to derail his tenuous connection with his wide eyed innocent son. Think of a more intense darker quieter Willy Loman. Gil's desperation for professional and personal success mirrors the fortunes of his beloved but ailing San Francisco Giants who haven't won a pennant in years. This might change though when the club announces a brand new marquee singing in Bobby Rayburn (Snipes) and so Gil starts to invest all his hopes in the success of this elite baseballer. <br/><br/>Gil feels a strong connection to him as he himself played baseball. In Gil's mind, he was a great ""has been"", but in reality he is a ""never was"" and never played beyond little league. He should be internally fixing his life, but instead he externalizes all of his hopes, failure and sadness into an unhealthy obsession for Rayburn.<br/><br/>Gil dips into fantasy whenever he faces external disappointment and finds solace in repeating mantras his childhood hero, little league coach Coop (Charles Hallahan) instilled in him years ago. Gil considers Coop the finest proponent of the art of baseball. When we see Coop later we realize this might be pure fabrication. As Gil's ability to judge reality deteriorates his obsession hurtles toward a dark dangerous and suicidal path; an older angrier ""Taxi Driver"" driven beyond the point of no return.<br/><br/>Bobby Rayburn in contrast sees life picture perfect. He knows he isn't Gods gift to the sport and admits it when he gets lucky on the diamond. But to someone like Gil, seeing Rayburn hitting a home run to win a game, its as magnificent as anything anyone has ever done in baseball. It happened because Rayburn is God's gift to the Giants. The schism between them, the golden ones that light up the scoreboards and simple folk like Gil, is apparent to everyone but Gil, whose continual lapse into childhood baseball fantasy is both realistic, understandable and tragic. Rarely has this spiritual divide been better examined in any sports related films. <br/><br/>This might explain the low rating this film has on this site. Film viewers want to live the Rayburn fantasy and not the loser reality however brilliantly observed in Gil. I gave it an 8 out 10."
"asifahsankhan","7","1","1","5 January 2017"," This could've been a great film. And ""I'm as serious as a F**king heart attack!""
","Any other actor might have kept us guessing about where the plot was heading... but we were straight out lucky to have the greatest actor on the planet (that's Robert De Niro) playing the role of Gil Renard, a baseball freak fixated on centre fielder Bobby Rayburn (Wesley Snipes), who has traded up from Milwaukee to the San Francisco Giants with a wow $40 million contract. For De Niro, maybe, it was just another film role, just another character and yet another, brilliant performance, which would go unnoticed... The term ""method acting"" is synonymous with Robert De Niro. <br/><br/>With De Niro, there's no mystery. He flashes that sicko grin from his seat in Candlestick Park, and we duck. He learns he's about to lose his job selling knives (!), and we know it won't be long until the stabbing starts. That's the problem. You sit down to watch The Fan and wonder how De Niro is going to come up with something new after firing on presidential candidate Leonard Harris in Taxi Driver, kidnapping TV star Jerry Lewis in The King of Comedy, torturing lawyer Nick Nolte in Cape Fear and abusing stepson Leonardo DiCaprio in This Boy's Life, to name just a few of the victims De Niro has memorably stalked.<br/><br/>Up till this point, ""The Fan"" is badly rated because of Tony Scott's miss-direction, not crappy performances by the cast or anything like a bad plot line. It shows signs of finding fresh life in a stale formula even Jim Carrey couldn't sell with The Cable Guy. De Niro is so persuasive and moving that you wish the film would let him develop the character and dodge the slasher stuff. It's not to be. The Fan rides with De Niro, (and no one else, okay maybe the kids were fine as well) substituting crass exploitation for insight.<br/><br/>Perhaps the late great director's brother, Ridley Scott could find gravity in this story; Tony Scott goes for the gore and the box- office gold. He strands his MVP, who is too skilled an actor to let himself get typed. De Niro will never be a typecast. A nut. One more flick like The Fan and he may discover he's created his own Frankenstein monster. <br/><br/>De Niro is someone we knew from the moment we saw him for the first time on screen: How god damn good he really was...and still is... and can be. The film roles doesn't matter, seriously. <br/><br/>What Bill Clinton Is To fries and a Big Mac, Robert De Niro is to psychos and mobsters. He can't get enough of them. De Niro eats those suckers for breakfast. Maybe he should change his diet after The Fan, (which he did actually). Because sometime you just need to skip your breakfast, you know, just to get your appetite ready for a bigger meal, for lunch. <br/><br/>A pumped-up, pin-headed thriller from slick-trick director, the late Tony Scott, this could've been a great film. And ""I'm as serious as a F**king heart attack!"""

","Tony Scott's the fan is a wild ride with an off the hook turn from Robert De Niro. It's ranked and regarded as a pretty low notch on Scott's belt, but it's hard to compete with his best work. It's still a sleazy blast and pure Scott, his characters always let, lurid and delightfully pulpy. Sure it falls apart near the end, but until then it's nasty, delicious fun. De Niro plays Gil, a die hard baseball fan and devout follower of Bobby Rayburn (Wesley Snipes), star player for his favourite team. Gil wants Bobby to succeed so badly that he becomes violent, unstable and pretty bonkers. At first it's obnoxious and amusing, but soon he gets dodgy and dangerous and eventually just out of control. It's great fun seeing De Niro go bug nuts bit by bit, and he's always had a wild menace that he like to take down from the shelf and dust off for the occasional performance. Benicio Del Toro does one of his puzzling, indecipherable vocal riffs as a rival player, adding to the weird factor. Ellen Barkin is a sexy sass bomb as Jewal Stern, a mouthy talk show host who sniffs out the controversy in high style. John Leguizamo is always sterling, and classes his scenes up like a pro. Watch for speckled cameos from M.C. Gainey, Brad William Henke, Don S. Davis, Tuesday Knight, Wayne Duvall, Richard Rhiele, John Carrol Lynch, Michael P. Michael P Byrne and Chris Mulkey as well, all excellent. Not Scott's best for sure, but a nicely mean spirited little romp through the psycho stalker fields. Fun stuff."

","The Plot: Gil Renard (De Niro) is an everyday guy with a lot of problems. He's divorced and is barely able to hold his job as a knife salesman. But there is one thing that Gil can find solace in: baseball. He's a dedicated fan of his San Francisco Giants and now that prized player Bobby Rayburn (Snipes) has been added to the team, Gil is all the more into the sport. But as his life spirals down further, the unstable and short tempered Gil becomes psychotically fixated on his favorite player and will do anything, even murder, to make sure that Bobby is the best in the league.<br/><br/>I don't see why critics dogged this movie. This is actually one tense thriller and I liked the lead performance by De Niro as this whacked out fan. You actually kind of feel bad for the poor schmuck. His life has hit a bad pitch (no pun intended) and he tries to make things better by taking his son to ballgames among other things. And when he goes into full-on psycho, De Niro is perfectly creepy. As for Snipes, he's not too bad. He's got problems of his own, too, as his character has to deal with being distant from his own son. The soundtrack is pretty good, with multiple versions of the Nine Inch Nails song ""Closer"" playing during the more intense scenes. Film score legend Hans Zimmer also provides the official score, which is both twisted and somewhat heartfelt (mostly during the earlier bits of the film).<br/><br/>On the bad end, there was some cinematography issues throughout. And sadly, this movie could have used a better script. Gil's poem during the opening credits and his baseball logic he learned from his old ""mentor"" Coop are the only real high points in the writing. And I wasn't too impressed with the film's limp ending.<br/><br/>Overall, this is actually a pretty good film. It's directed by Tony Scott, who's had a pretty good track record with films like Man on Fire, Enemy of the State, Top Gun, and the remake of The Taking of Pelham 123. Sadly, this is one of his most underrated films that deserved a whole lot more than it did."

By then, my senses had been assaulted enough with the gratuitous profanity. Much of it wasn't necessary, and I can put up with a lot. You have Robert De Niro, Wesley Snipes, Ellen Barkin and John Legusimo all talking like pigs right from the first sentence of the movie.<br/><br/>You know, it might have been a good movie about greedy baseball players and an obsessed fan, but come on - in the first 10 minutes alone I heard 20- f-words and 10 usages of the Lord's name in vain! That is ridiculous. I think De Niro is one of the top actors of his generation, but when he plays a role like this, he's wasted. I expect ultra-profanity from those other three low-life actors but kind of hoped De Niro was above this, except for his Martin Scorcese crime films.<br/><br/>Even if you can stand the verbal abuse, the story was not appealing because there are no likable characters. Also, did anyone notice the blaring music, which was obnoxiously loud. I have to listen to ""Nine Inch Nails"" screaming?

She's a good actress, but seemed out of place in this role. To me, they always seemed to rush the scenes, and then it drags a bit in places. It just seemed tio me to be so uneven!

"MovieAddict2016","8","3","6","29 April 2005"," One of the most underrated films of the past decade and a gripping character study
","No, I'm not joking.<br/><br/>And no, I'm not just saying this because I'm a De Niro fan.<br/><br/>I admit when he makes mistakes -- ""Rocky and Bullwinkle"" for example -- but the critics really took a beating on De Niro when this was released and I think the criticism was wholly unfair. In my opinion ""The Fan"" is one of the best thrillers of its kind, up until the messy conclusion (which is stupid, far-fetched and disappointing). It reeks of Hollywood interference - as if test screenings failed and the corporates demanded a re-shoot, or something.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie seems too honest to deserve such a horrible ending. De Niro plays Gil, an obsessive baseball fan who takes a liking to newly recruited Giants player Bobby (Wesley Snipes), whose contract was some $40 million for the team. Others are skeptics, but Gil believes in Bobby, even after an injury lowers his batting average and fans everywhere cry bloody outrage.<br/><br/>Gil decides to take matters into his own hands by ""helping"" Bobby -- until the baseball player turns on his fans and Gil feels betrayed and works up a revenge scheme.<br/><br/>The plot summary for this may sound stupid, but I like it because of the depth added to the characters. The film really builds up insight into Gil, a failing knife salesman who has a strange obsession with the Rolling Stones, baseball and violence.<br/><br/>In fact the subtleties are what make this movie succeed past others of its genre. We don't understand what's going on with the Rolling Stones at first. ""Sympathy for the Devil"" is playing on Gil's car radio and later some more songs, and then inside his room we catch a brief glimpse of a Rolling Stones shrine with pictures of Mick Jagger... maybe Gil is in fact a repressed homosexual? Or perhaps before he took a liking to baseball he stalked the Stones as well.<br/><br/>It's my opinion that Gil is a continuation of the Travis Bickle character from ""Taxi Driver."" It's like seeing him 20 years onwards. The obsessions, compulsions and behavioral problems are all the same -- in fact, if anything, worse than before.<br/><br/>I really do like this movie for the most part. Up until its conclusion it's well-made, a taught character study that doesn't rely on stupid action sequences for effect. It takes its time studying Gil and most of the film is indeed dedicated to revealing his true nature, which is rare for a Hollywood film these days, and especially rare for a Tony Scott film.<br/><br/>I don't understand why all the critics hated this, I think it's one of my favorite guilty pleasures."

Our salesman harbors a murderous obsession when the hard hitting all star falls into the worst slump in his career and the Giants are feared to crumble along with him. De Niro is terror personified. Snipes seems very natural as the ballplayer. Other notables in the cast are: the still attractive Ellen Barkin, John Leguizamo, Benicio Del Toro and Patti D'Arbanville.

","Lots of this movie was good. DeNiro effectively portrays a sick man who swears violently in the presence of his young son. Patti D'Arbanville effectively plays the victimized, frustrated wife. Wesley Snipes is believable as a major league athlete. It's no secret that Rayburn's character was modeled after Barry Bonds. The Giants had recently acquired the superstar from the Pirates in 1993. There was also a jersey number conflict when Barry Bonds joined the team. He always wore number 24, but the Giants had retired that number; it having belonged to hall of famer Willie Mays. Mays, Barry's godfather, gave Bonds permission to use it, but Barry refused and switched to his dad, Bobby Bonds' old number, 25. The movie was ultimately spoiled by huge suspensions in belief. The mutual dislike between Rayburn an Primo mirrored the real-life mutual dislike between MVP's Barry Bonds and Jeff Kent. But the pettiness involved here made the players seem like spoiled children. The part where DeNiro's character managed to coax Rayburn's son into the Hummer and drive off was never explained. Why Rayburn never immediately notified the police and an APB called to find such a conspicuous vehicle is incredulous. The fact that DeNiro was able to kill an umpire and switch places with him during the course of a rain-delayed game, was never explained. It just popped up as if in a Bugs Bunny cartoon. The game resumed and Rayburn attempted an inside the park HR during a torrential downpour that rivaled any monsoon in India. No way the game would have resumed in such conditions. Also, the fact that it was pitch dark despite the use of stadium lights was never explained. Great acting and great premise for a great film. Unfortunately, it was wasted by lapses in reality."

","The Fan features Robert De Niro as Gil Renard, a struggling knife salesman and a baseball fanatic whose life revolves around his favorite team, the San Francisco Giants. Wesley Snipes takes up the role of a star player named Bobby Rayburn, who becomes the target of Renard's murderous intentions after being signed by the Giants for a record-breaking fee ahead of the new season. Both De Niro and Snipes deliver fine performances, with De Niro's character making for a believable representation of a hapless individual who is slowly consumed by his own frustrations and eventually gets to a point where he has to stay focused on making his demise as memorable as possible.<br/><br/>The Fan generally turns out to be a gripping and nicely made thriller on the topic of unhealthy obsession, even though it does rely upon many of the tropes that can be regarded as typical of the genre in the 1990s. It should be equally emphasized that the volatile nature of De Niro's character does a lot to keep the viewer interested in the story and its outcome. As for the choice of baseball as the sport around which the film revolves, it is certainly something that is not likely to be appealing to a viewer from a country other than the United States. However, The Fan does depict several issues that are commonly and timelessly criticized when it comes to professional sports. Therefore, it is possible to relate many of these issues to any other sport that has the potential of being attractive to millions of viewers.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, it is mainly the preposterous nature of its ending that prevents The Fan from being a flawless thriller. Unfortunately, the movie was not spared from featuring some ludicrously unrealistic scenes of shooting and murder occurring during a sporting event in the interior of a stadium filled with thousands of spectators, a plot element that had already caught the attention in The Last Boy Scout, an earlier film directed by Tony Scott and dealing with a similar theme. Another sequence that could be seen as playing a role in preventing The Fan from being a fully credible thriller turns out to be the one in which Rayburn's main in-team rival gets murdered by Renard in such a theatrical manner that I ended up laughing."

","I've seen this film on the shelf of the local video-shop so many times over the last half year or so. I kept considering buying it, and I kept deciding against it, mainly because I had barely heard anything at all about it(and certainly nothing positive). It aired on TV tonight, and I can only say that I'm happy I didn't spend any money on it. It's not a bad film, but it's not really a good one, either. It's somewhat average and it just doesn't feel like a complete movie. The plot is decent enough, and probably original... but it drags like you wouldn't believe. I don't remember the last time(if there was one) I saw such an uneventful and slow-moving film. De Niro gives the typical psycho performance, as seen previously in Taxi Driver and more recently in Cape Fear. Scott lazily directs this in no particular direction... it pretty much just goes on and on, with pretty much nothing really happening. I'm not sure if Scott was shooting for a character driven piece... but if he did, he missed. Unimaginative cinematography and repeated usage of the same cuts further adds to the boredom. A fairly good but overly loud score makes the viewing a tad bit more tolerable, as does the fairly high level of talent in all of the film's acting performances. De Niro's character is interesting, but we know too little about him, about who he really is, his past. In the end, maybe the real problem is that there's hardly anyone to root for in the film. De Niro is introduced as if he was the hero, but we quickly realize that he's the direct opposite. We then turn to Snipes, but he turns out to be a superstitious and unappealing athlete. One thing that bothered me was the heavy emphasis on the baseball game(but that's probably just me and my anti-sports view-point). As far as showing fanaticism and obsession at its worst, the film is OK. As genuine entertainment, there's really nothing in this, beyond the fairly good acting and score. I recommend this only to the biggest fans of De Niro, Snipes and Scott. Everyone else should probably just skip it. 6/10"

As far as the story its one we've seen before: obsessed loony follows and spies on a stranger.  Knife salesman (ooh, scary) DeNiro has a thing for Snipes, a ball player who just signed a big deal with the S.F. Giants.  After all the usual threatening and psychotic behavior, theres a big confrantation in a rain soaked game where DeNiro wants Snipes to homer so he can have his kidnapped son back.  At one point Snipes just comes out and asks (more like screams) ""what do you want from me?!""  To which DeNiro replies...nothing! He doesnt say a word.  Thats when you know the film is a total waste as he doesnt even have a reason for his behavior.  Another annoying aspect is how Tony Scott shoots EVERY scene in close-up it seems like.  Every characrter is right up in our face in virtually every shot and it makes the screen so claustrophobic like youve been crowded into a room with bodies shoved up against you.  And now for the baseball scenes, so unproffesionally put together.  I mean a player wearing a visiting uniform hits a ball to the outfield...in his home stadium!  Now all of a sudden hes wearing a home white uniform as he runs the bases.  Or a ball is pitched in Candlestick Park and after its hit the outfield becomes that of Coors Field. Or fans doing the wave in every shot, or the final game played in nearly hurricane like conditions.  Oh, what a mess.  What can you expect of a British born director?

"aforandromeda","5","1","2","31 August 2014"," Well acted but deeply flawed pulp thriller.
","From the opening scenes of 'The Fan', it's all too obvious that the late Tony Scott was a strange choice of director for a suspense thriller. Scott's trademark flashy visuals, breathless camera work and hyperactive editing are there from the outset as die-hard San Francisco Giants fan Gil (Robert De Niro), speeds across town in his van while engaging in a somewhat bizarre radio phone-in about the Giants' new $40 million star signing Bobby Rayburn (Wesley Snipes).<br/><br/>Once things calm down a little, we learn that Gil is a hunting supplies salesman who's having a tough time meeting his targets and is under threat of losing his job. Gil is also divorced and struggling to manage access to his son.<br/><br/>When opening day arrives, separate incidents mark a serious downturn in fortunes for both Gil and Bobby, with Gil eventually developing a disturbing obsession with the slugger, thus setting off a frightening chain of events.<br/><br/>'The Fan' is remarkable for a suspense thriller in that it lacks any real suspense. Although Tony Scott wasn't helped by a threadbare and illogical script, the clunky camera-work and jumpy editing mar any feeling of involvement or tension for the viewer in many of the scenes, with the excessive use of close ups beginning to grate after a while. Also, the baseball scenes feel very unnatural and stagey. Most regrettable are the attempts to portray the characters' motivations to the audience, which are two dimensional at best, downright lazy at worst. As the movie jumps from one unlikely encounter and set of circumstances to another, all credibility quickly unravels.<br/><br/>What rescues this movie from outright mediocrity are the excellent performances from a terrific cast, with De Niro and Snipes both being engaging despite their rather clichéd and poorly scripted roles. The supporting cast is top drawer, with John Leguizamo as Bobby's unscrupulous agent and Ellen Barkin's languid radio host being highlights, especially in their all too brief scenes together.<br/><br/>Over and above the poor quality of the script, you're left with the impression that this is a movie with plenty of style but little in the way of substance. A different choice of director would have helped this movie be more than the mediocre pulp fare that it is, as although Scott was a fine director, creating tension and projecting believable characters was not his forte. <br/><br/>Although 'The Fan' is fairly watchable in parts, by the time the hammy and frankly ludicrous final act is over, you're left with a feeling that it could all have been so much better."

","This is a film that I have to consider underrated. This thing was battered back in 1996 when it was released by movie critics, because of everything from the storyline to the sound track to Robert De Niro's haircut. First of all, the storyline, in my opinion, actually better than what everybody says (it isnt great, but Gigli would be a rated a 6 with a storyline of ""The Fan"" quality.). Second of all, that is one good sountrack. When you can get all the quality songs from Gimme Shelter to Nine Inch Nails tunes on your soundtrack, you have hit the jackpot. And lastly, De Niro is a great actor, no matter what his haircut is.<br/><br/>OK, all ratings aside, lets get to my full view of the ""The Fan"". (Spoliers herein).<br/><br/>The story revolves around the frustrated, unemployed Gil Renard (De Niro), who, despite all his problems surrounding his job and family, seems ecstatic about the big aquisition of Bobby Rayburn (Wesley Snipes)from the Atlanta Braves, for $40 million big ones. Renard is a huge Giants fan, the kind of fan who keeps team memorabilia and wears a team watch, and the kind that will skip work just for opening day. Renard isnt doing good at work however, showing up late for work and ignoring the orders of his boss, so he soon becomes a former employee for his company. To make matters worse, he is divorced, and is having troubles with his wife and his young son Richie, who he only gets to see with parenting time.<br/><br/>Deniro is most definately the protagonist here, and a pretty good one too. We follow the Renard character throughout the movie, and his deteroiration too. We find that Renard is a very troubled character, who seems to not be able to handle the curve balls thrown at him in life (he proves this with the comment ""baseball is better than life. its fair""). He is also very obsessive too, especially when he talks about how him and Coop could have made the big leagues.<br/><br/>If there is anything wrong with this movie, it is the overuse of the music. Certain points deserved music (ie. the bug getting stabbed, the Gimme Shelter scene), but there was way too much music played in this movie, possibly more than i have ever heard in one movie before. The acting here was great, Deniro turned in another great performance, with Snipes and company turning in good supporting roles.<br/><br/>Overall, a good movie, one that shouldn't be taken too seriously, but rather should be watched as some entertainment.<br/><br/>7/10"

","Oscar-winning actor Robert De Niro has made a reputation for himself playing psychos in memorable Martin Scorsese pictures, such as ""Mean Streets,"" ""Taxi Driver,"" ""Goodfellas,"" and ""Cape Fear."" In ""Top Gun"" director Tony Scott's half-baked thriller ""The Fan,"" De Niro creates another psycho but one with greater sympathy. As Gil Renard, De Niro plays a Willie Loman-like knife salesman whose obsession with baseball in general and the San Francisco Giants in particular takes him over the edge. When the Giants play $40-million to obtain the services of Atlanta superstar slugger Bobby Rayburn (Wesley Snipes of ""White Men Can't Jump""), Gil gives new meaning to fan worship. He thinks that Bobby can solve all of the Giants' problems. During a radio call-in show, Gil defends Bobby from the barbs of catty talk show host Jewel Stern (Ellen Barkin).<br/><br/>The plot of ""The Fan"" alternates between the lives of Gil and Bobby. Gil's sales sink to the point that he finds himself out of work with the knife company that his father formed. Nevertheless, Gil's descent into self-destruction isn't the only one. Bobby shows up in the Giants' locker room and learns to his chagrin that he will suit up as number 33 instead of his lucky number 11. As it turns out, rival Giants' outfielder Juan Primo (Benicio Del Toro of ""License to Kill"") wears number 11 and refuses to relinquish it for less than a half-a-million bucks. Their first day in the outfield, Primo and Bobby collide in pursuit of a fly ball. During the collision, Bobby loses his good luck necklace with the number eleven on it. Afterward, Bobby falls into a batting slump. He starts striking out on a regular basis. Before long the fans are booing him every time that he steps up to home plate. Everybody except Gil hates him and Gil decides to give Bobby a little help. <br/><br/>Veteran action director Tony Scott pulls out every cinematic trick to propel ""The Fan"" along to a thrilling conclusion. Unfortunately, the film loses momentum in the last half hour because predictability paralyzes it. By that time, Gil has turned against Bobby. The gratuitous, blood-squib squirting finale comes as less of a thrill and more of a thud in a film that is ultimately downbeat. In other words, you won't feel chipper after to watch it. Robert De Niro's psycho character earns a little sympathy because his son in the film loves him. It is difficult for audiences to hate a villain who can elicit sympathy from another character. Their troubled father-son relationship shows a human side of De Niro's Gil Renard so he never degenerates completely into a toxically overblown monster. Instead, he is a man who paranoia and poor luck undermines him and takes him into the danger zone. Wesley Snipes brings a virile athletic presence to the role of Bobby Rayburn. Ellen Barkin hovers on the sidelines as a tabloid-minded sports announcer, but her role appears to have gotten lost on the editing room floor. Sorry, guys, no nudity here either. <br/><br/>""The Fan"" is a must see for De Niro fans, but if you're not up for foul language and the grim side of the human psyche, this R-rated effort may be out of your league."
"PWNYCNY","5","1","4","4 October 2007"," Good story goes awry
","This movie is like a steam locomotive that starts out chugging down the tracks full throttle but then loses steam and grinds to an unceremonial halt before reaching its final destination. Also, this movie suffers from some major miscasting. In this movie Robert Deniro attempts to recreate his Travis Bickle character but alas, twenty years later, it doesn't work. Also, casting Wesley Snipes as Mr. Deniro's victim is simply unbelievable, especially after Mr. Snipes's performance in Demolition Man. If anything, their roles should have been reversed. Yet the movie does make interesting use of professional sports as a venue for portraying the dynamics associated with displaced aggression. But if you want to watch a really good crime dram/thriller that effectively incorporates a baseball park into the story, watch Experiment in Terror with Glenn Ford, Lee Remick, Martin Ross and Stephanie Powers. Now THAT was a great movie."

","Films like ""The Fan"" come a dime a dozen. The movie is made like a whacked music video with wild camera shots that annoy more than dazzle the audience. Robert DeNiro stars as a psychopath who is the biggest fan of new San Francisco Giant Wesley Snipes. When Snipes goes into a slump and gets replaced in the lineup by Benicio Del Toro, DeNiro strikes back so his ""man"" can reclaim the limelight. Now DeNiro wants something in return: he wants thanks and he wants to be in Snipes' life for good. DeNiro does his best ""Cape Fear"" imitation and it fails once again just as it did in that film. Snipes seems out-of-place here too and he usually does well in sports-themed films. Supporters like Ellen Barkin and John Leguizamo just seem to be present in the dizzying venture. The direction is unclear and the story just does not play well on the silver screen. 2 stars out of 5."

So let's review...De Niro/Snipes are good actors...script is laughably bad...people behind the camera tried to divert attention from the script but it didn't work.<br/><br/>Please see other movies under the ""psycho stalker"" category on IMDB (""Blue Steel,"" ""Duel,""  etc.).

","I won't use much time and energy on this user comment, other then letting of some steam on the one aspect that ruins this movie as a whole: the soundtrack.<br/><br/>I do not know wether it's composer Hans Zimmer's fault (even masters can have a moment where they show a total lack of common sense) or director Tony Scott. This truly has to be the best example ever presented to a wide audience, of a cool movie that is clubbed to death by it's soundtrack. And I'm not kidding. There is about ten minutes of total silence in the movie, other than that it is jam packed with non-stop songs from the Rolling Stones and Nine Inch Nails, not that one or two matters, but through the whole movie!?!? As if the talent of Hans Zimmer doesn't cut it!<br/><br/>If you weren't dumb when you sit down to watch this movie you sure will be after it's over, your brain beaten to a bloody pulp by the loudspeakers!<br/><br/>Guard your ears..."

","I have to say that this is the worst baseball film ever.some people will say rookie of the year is the worst baseball film,but at least that had it's cute moments.I thought the scene where wesley snipes had to hit  a homerun or else his son would be killed was bogus,and having rain fall down at that moment also unrealistic.I thought the scene whre del toro was killed in that shower was ridiciolous.At the time the san francisco giants had the worst record in 96 and they probablly made the film so movie fans would become san francisco giants fans and buy merchandise."
"loriharon","Null","0","3","25 January 2019"," One of the worst films of both Scott and De-Niro
","Lately Robert Deniro has been only acting to collect paychecks(Hey- nothing wrong with it you know) but does considering pay roles mean he doesn't even look at the script? The Fan is another one of those De-Niro duds that should have been made with lesser actors. Given De Niro's track record, it was reasonable to expect good things from him in The Fan, director Tony Scott's followup to last year's blockbuster, Crimson Tide. In fact, with De Niro playing a sociopathic baseball nut, one might be forgiven mistakenly believing that this movie had potential. Unfortunately, whatever promise the idea held was lost early in the film making process. The version of The Fan to reach movie screens is as unwatchable a thriller as has come to theaters this year. De-Niro hams it up like he's never done before and the screenplay by Phoef Sutton is abysmal. The Fan is disjointed, poorly paced, and, at times, completely incoherent. While Sutton has to bear some of the blame, the lion's share goes to Tony Scott, who has badly mishandled every aspect of this film. The director appears to have backslided into his unpromising Beverly Hills Cop II phase."

","It's probably best that you ignore the hackneyed plot of this movie, plus all of the déjà vu you'll be getting from watching it. Sure, we've seen this type of movie before, many times, but slickness of direction, good cinematography and two standout performances from Snipes and De Niro as the leads make this a worthwhile venture, no matter what the critics might say.<br/><br/>Basically, De Niro revisits his role in TAXI DRIVER as a normal, everyday kind of man who is thrown out of sync with everyday life and is forced to take drastic action to be noticed. De Niro's acting is flawless and he really convinces us that he's completely mad in his tour-de-force performance of innocent knife salesman turned psycho. Wesley Snipes is also surprisingly powerful as the good-natured star forced to deal with an obsessed fan, emoting pretty well in some heavy scenes. Ellen Barkin is realistic but irritating as a commentator, while the familiar face of John Leguizamo has little to do as Snipes' agent. Benicio del Toro briefly appears as a rival baseball player who comes off the worse for wear after his encounter with De Niro.<br/><br/>The movie is at its most subtle and best at the beginning, with a character study of De Niro's initial descent into his insanity. There are many clichés along the way, and over the top bits, culminating in a ending which is a bit predictable, but still fun thanks to the actors. While not a gory film (aside from one unforgettable scene), this is still pretty violent stuff, both physically and mentally, thanks to effects work from Kevin Yagher. It's also quite disturbing and frightening, and has an edge of hard realism which makes it a gripping movie. Although not the most original film of all time, this is a fine showcase for the talents of the two leading men and passes the time well enough."
"vincentlynch-moonoi","6","0","1","28 February 2016"," The music score destroyed this film
","I'm not a baseball fan, although occasionally a good baseball film goes down well. But I admire Robert DeNiro and very much enjoyed Wesley Snipes in his prime. So I really thought I would enjoy this film. You wanna know what RUINED it for me? Overbearing music. It was distracting to the dialogue. Maybe that explains why it was such a bomb at the box office.<br/><br/>It certainly wasn't the acting. Robert DeNiro is absolutely great as a man whose life is falling apart...losing his job and losing his son. And so he begins to obsess more and more about his favorite pastime -- baseball...and particularly his favorite player -- Wesley Snipes. OBSESSION...always a dangerous situation.<br/><br/>Wesley Snipes is excellent here as well, as a talented baseball player who realizes he is taking the game too seriously. Too bad he tells his rabid fan that! Result -- kidnapping! This film was when Snipes was near his peak.<br/><br/>Benicio del Toro is good in a limited role as a young and upcoming baseball player that meets the ire of DeNiro. John Leguizamo is quite good as Snipes' manager...cementing my belief that he was more a supporting actor than primary star.<br/><br/>I think the film has a good level of suspense, and I could have easily given it a ""7"", had it not been for the terrible score."

","Sometimes baseball can be more important than life itself.<br/><br/>Starring Robert De Niro and Wesley Snipes.<br/><br/>Written by Peter Abrahams ( Book ) and Phoef Sutton ( Screenplay).<br/><br/>Directed by Tony Scott.<br/><br/>Sometimes a very average movie can be carried by one great acting performance.<br/><br/>It's never been truer said than in this one. Everything else about The Fan is distinctly average. The plot has been done to death. Obsessed fan becomes a dangerous fan. Obsessed fan has newspaper clippings pinned to his walls. Obsessed fan resorts to murder.<br/><br/>Most of the acting performances are average as well, including Wesley Snipes in what I'm guessing is one of his early acting roles. Or maybe it's more of a case of actors being miscast?<br/><br/>I didn't buy the plot. For the first half of the film the main character is just a terrible husband that seems destined to screw up his relationship with his ex and his son. And then suddenly the movie jumps the shark and he turns into an obsessed fan with a pair of binoculars and a taste for murder. The whole production is a bit of a damp squid but Robert De Niro delivers a good performance that manages to stop the film from hurtling over the edge of a cliff.<br/><br/>An average 6/10 but mainly because of Robert De Niro."
"slightlymad22","6","0","1","15 August 2014"," Not many fans for The Fan
","In this psychological thriller, Robert De Niro fresh off Casino and Heat, stars as a down on his luck salesman who becomes obsessed with his favourite baseball player Wesley Snipes, who despite his last few movies Drop Zone, Money Train flopping, was still popular after success in movies like 'Demolition Man' with Sly Stallone and 'Rising Sun' with Sean Connery, both of which grossed over $100 million dollars.<br/><br/>De Niro who has contributed some tough fisted, hard as nails characters over the years is walked over and insulted by people early on as salesman Gil, but he remains as intense as always. Snipes is charismatic and likable as the Giants new record signing Bobby Rayburn.<br/><br/>Benico Del Toro is annoyingly effective as Rayburn's rival player. John Leguizamo puts in a fine performance as Rayburn's agent. Ellen Barkin pops up as the local sports reporter, intent on getting the story if the star player is worth $40 million. And look for a blink and you'll miss him Jack Black working for Barkin.<br/><br/>Given the talent involved, I'm surprised this failed to find an audience, as Tony Scott's direction keeps things moving at a steady pace and it is an intense movie that whilst not a home run is more than watchable.<br/><br/>Worth checking out at least once."
"raisleygordon","Null","0","2","20 August 2012"," A so-so movie that takes too long to get to the point
","DeNiro gives an okay, but one-note performance as a dedicated baseball fan who, as a result of his fixation on Bobby Rayburn (#11), loses his job and family. Other than to show that he has a bad temper, I don't see how they are relevant to the movie. I think too much time is spent on the scenes at home, on the job, and on the baseball game itself. And DeNiro's acting just didn't seem genuine at all. In most movies about people who go from obsessing to stalking, this line is crossed at about halfway through the movie. But here, it doesn't happen until almost the very end, which is too little too late. Also, how could the Benicio Del Toro have really been killed if this was only seen in Renard's mind? Or did I miss something? It's not a bad movie, but it could have been more.<br/><br/>** out of ****"
"SwingBatta","Null","0","2","2 August 2003"," Only the acting prevents ""The Fan"" from striking out
","While Ridley Scott (""Alien,"" ""Blade Runner"") continues to get the pick of the litter, younger brother Tony (""Days of Thunder,"" ""The Last Boy Scout"") is sometimes relegated to the leftovers, and ""The Fan"" is no exception. Unemployed knife salesman and San Francisco Giants fan Gil Renard (Robert DeNiro) is obsessed with his favorite player, $40 million acquisition Bobby Rayburn (Wesley Snipes). When Rayburn suffers through the worst slump of his career, Renard is more than willing to do anything to help him break out of it. It plays just as hokey as it sounds and is saved by good acting from a strong cast. Snipes has little to do in the thankless jock role but makes the most of it, and John Leguizamo is memorable as Rayburn's sleazy agent, but DeNiro, way over the top here but through no fault of his own, is more Max Patkin than Max Cady in a film that contains moderate bang for the buck yet ultimately fails to generate any actual thrills. ""The Fan"" tries to include a commentary on the relationship between high-priced ballplayers and the fans who pay their salary (one memorable line: ""We're the ones who get you your $40 [expletive] million""), but it's drowned out by the tepid script, frenzied cinematography, and director Scott's peculiar fixation with the Nine Inch Nails catalog. The telltale sign that ""The Fan"" doesn't deliver as a thriller is when the most memorable scene consists of DeNiro swallowing his pride and shaving his legs with a hunting knife during in-store demonstrations. 7/10"
