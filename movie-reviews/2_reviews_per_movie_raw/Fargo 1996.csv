","""What'd this guy look like anyway?""  ""Oh, he was a little guy, kinda funny lookin'.""  ""Uh-huh. In what way?""  ""Just a general way.""  In that interplay between a Brainerd, MN., police officer and a witness  discussing a criminal investigation, you have one of your principal  pieces of dialogue from what is considered by many to be Joel and Ethan  Coen's finest film.  Of course you can draw comparisons to others they've made, such as  Blood Simple, Raising Arizona, even Barton Fink and The Big Lebowski.  But Fargo illustrates the Coen Brothers' takes on plot, art and drama  more succinctly and emotionally than any of those others. Here you have  a set of memorable, if not always likable, characters in a plot that  goes from clunky to chaotic in the most unspoiled manner, from Jerry  Lundegaard's stilted conversation with Gaear and Carl in a bar in Fargo  at the beginning of the movie - the only occasion in which the movie  specifically shows you Fargo, N.D. - to Marge Gunderson's confrontation  with Gaear and the wood-chipper.  Frances McDormand deservedly won an Oscar for playing a well-balanced,  intelligent, pregnant police officer placing her own straightforward  methodology on to an investigation of bizarre goings-on. And William H.  Macy gives a true one-two punch playing a frenetically-charged, fearful  and, in the end, inept used car salesman trying in the most remarkable  manner to make money. The two best scenes in the movie are the two  occasions in which Marge questions Jerry about the Brainerd murders and  a car from his lot being involved -- I couldn't imagine an actress  doing a better job of seriously but comically exclaiming, ""He's fleeing  the interview!""  Notable among the actors as well are Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare  playing Carl and Gaear, the two hit men hired by Jerry to help him con  his father-in-law out of money. There's comic brilliance watching  Stormare silently grimace at Buscemi's violent but gregarious behavior,  and Buscemi shines being able to play the most out-of-control of all  the characters in the movie. Kristin Rudrüd also stands out playing  Jean Lundegaard, Jerry's haplessly kidnapped wife.  If you can appreciate an intelligent look at not-always-so-intelligent  life on this planet, you'll enjoy the little more than the hour and a  half this movie has to show you."

","Boy, is this a good movie. In its bare bones it is a crime drama but the Coen brothers constantly undercut the seriousness with a quirky irony. The acting, the script, and the direction lift the movie light years above most of the movies of its decade.<br/><br/>The performances, for instance, everyone speaks with what passes for an upper Midwestern accent, a very pronounced accent, let's say. So when characters are doing wicked things on screen, it's rather like watching people dressed in clown suits do nasty things. It's utterly impossible to take it very seriously -- only just seriously enough for us to feel sorry for the victims and to disapprove of the bad guys, but no more than that.<br/><br/>Everyone except the two killers are forced by their culture to speak and act cheerfully. They never swear either. ""You're darn tootin',"" they say. The casting couldn't be better, with Frances McDormand, Steve Buscemi, and Bill Macy outstanding.<br/><br/>The script is likewise splendidly done. It's full of scenes that seem peripheral except that they add to our understanding of the characters and often lead to later payoffs. Without taking the space to describe them, I will simply mention the scene in the restaurant between MacDormand and her Japanese friend from high school. Why is it in there at all? (My God, those hotel restaurants are depressingly ugly.) Well -- among other things, such as establishing the kind of milieu these folks consider Ritzy, it tells us quite a bit about how MacDormand handles attempts to violate her inherent good nature. When the Japanese guy tries to sit next to her she tells him firmly that she'd prefer it if he sat across the table so that she can see him more easily. When he breaks down in tears she whispers that it's all okay. She is polite, a little distant without being unfriendly, completely practical, and absolutely iron bound in her values. Nobody is going to take advantage of or discompose this hyper pregnant babe. Further, this scene is a set up for a later one. After MacDormand learns that the Japanese guy has told her a gaggle of lies, she wakes up to the fact that, yes, people can tell untruths -- and she returns to interview Macy a second time. <br/><br/>In another scene, when she's pressing one of the criminals during an interview, he excuses himself for a moment and she spots him taking off in his car. She exclaims, ""Oh, for Pete's sake, he's FLEEIN' THE INTERVIEW."" It's impossible to improve on a line like that, or on MacDormand's delivery of it.<br/><br/>The third element of the film that makes it superior is the direction. The pauses come at the right times. A woman is sitting on her couch watching a soap opera on TV. Through the glass door of her apartment she sees a man approach. He's wearing a black ski mask and carrying a crowbar. He walks up to her door and shades his eyes while trying to peer inside. Now in an ordinary action movie, by this time the woman would be screeching and speeding down the hallway. Not here. The victim sits there staring at the intruder as he fiddles at the door, half horrified and half curious. ""Who is this guy? He's not the meter reader, is he?"" <br/><br/>Coen the director has an eye for the suggestive picturesque too. Bill Macy has asked his father-in-law for a large loan for some sure-fire business proposition, but Dad offers him only a finder's fee. We see Macy's deflated face as his disappointment sets in. Cut. Now we're looking at a white screen punctuated by four or five bare trees equidistant from one another, and there is a tiny car in the middle of the whiteness. Then Macy's tiny figure trudges into the bottom of the shot and we realize we're looking at a snow-filled parking lot with only one ordinary-sized car in the center of it.<br/><br/>Wintery weather plays an important part in the movie. People die in it, drive off the road because of it, stand shivering in it. Two freezing people are conversing on the street while one shovels snow. The shoveler stops, gazes up at the sky, and remarks that it ""ought to be really cold tomorrow."" Cars and ambulances tend to drive in and out of white outs during blizzards and blowing snow. MacDormand is driving her murdering prisoner through a niveous white landscape in which nothing much is visible and she is mildly remonstrating with him, saying something like, ""Why did you do it, for a little bit of money? It's a perfect day, and here you are."" (A perfect day!) <br/><br/>There are seven murders in this movie. Only three take place on screen. The others either take place off screen or else the director has the good sense to cut at the moment the gun fires or the ax blade lands.<br/><br/>""Fargo"" is one of perhaps half a dozen movies from the 1990s that I would consider buying on DVD. It's an original and refreshingly adult picture. Don't miss it."

","Fargo is a great piece of movie. It has a strong story and a strong cast. It's down to earth and believable.<br/><br/>Jerry Lundegaard is in some trouble. He hires two small time crocks from Fargo to kidnap his wife. The plan is for her father to pay off and for Jerry to take the money. Things don't exactly goes as planned as they kill three people and get a pregnant Chief on their tail.<br/><br/>The Coen brothers have does a terrific job on this movie. It's a well written, original story with an original setting and it doesn't try to be anything it isn't. Just a few characters, a simple plot and small scale. They stay away of clichés and don't even remotely try to mix in anything of that regular Hollywood crap. They manage to capture the mood, the people and the action pretty good. The characters are great, they're reasonable and believable. They manage to keep it serious, but not too serious and put inn a joke here and there.<br/><br/>The actors are great. They way they manage to put on a happy smile and make it seem polite and a little, but not all too false in a great way. William H. Macy is great as Jerry Lundegaard. He gives a little nervous, kind of boy scout performance and it fits perfect. Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare makes two great small time losers. Buscemi is great as a small, funny looking, constant talking bad guy and Stormare fits the big silent, violent, psychopath type really good and they act these characters all the way out. Kristin Rudrüd does a good job as Jean Lundegaard and Harve Presnell as the rich dad is always a winner.<br/><br/>The cinematography is good. All of the shots are good looking and some of them are original, cool and extra good looking. All of the shots are well composed, the lightning is good, but not much out of the ordinary. There are a nice play with the colors in some shots involving the snow.<br/><br/>The score is really nice. The theme is a little sad and so is the movie. It's moody and supports the action and fits the settings very well. It's used in a classical way between the action and that works very well, it makes the action seem more real and more close.<br/><br/>Fargo is a original movie out of the ordinary. The story is good, well written and it's well brought to life and captured. The Coen brothers has made a timeless and very enjoyable movie. See it!"

","I didn't see this in the theater but saw it the first week it was out for rental, and have enjoyed it ever since. In fact, I probably enjoy this more each time I view it. It's a sick movie, though, make no mistake about that. However, it holds a strange fascination, probably because of the odd characters.<br/><br/>About the story: first, it is NOT a true story as indicated in the movie. That's a lie. It's a fictional kidnapping-turned into murder story with a few bloody scenes, lots of profanity (most of it by Steve Buscemi) and a comedy. Yup, this is pure ""black comedy."" It's dark humor mixed in with a parody about the way the Scandanavian people in the upper Midwest supposedly speak.<br/><br/>Both William H. Macy and Frances McDormand have some wonderful facial expressions along with their accents. Those two and Buscemi are the lead characters and all three ""are a trip."" Macy is hilarious; the best character in here, in my opinion. The more I watch this film, the funnier he gets. It's also the best role, I assume, ever for McDormand who was never a star before - or since - this movie. Her character in here, ""Marge Gunderson,"" elevates this movie from just another modern-day sick crime movie, to an original. It's nice to see a wonderful husband-wife relationship, too, as is shown here with her and husband ""Norm"" (John Lynch).<br/><br/>You have this clean, old-fashioned lady cop (McDormand), a middle-of-the-road bungling car salesman (Macy) and two extreme low-life killers in ""Carl Showalter"" (Buscemi) and ""Gaear Grimsrud"" (Peter Stormare) all combining to make this story a mixture not only of people but genres. Other minor characters are strange, too, led by one of Marge's old high school acquaintances ""Mike Yanagita"" (Steve Park). Add to that some equally-bizarre music (slow violins) and you have this unusual story that brings out the morbid fascination in us viewers.<br/><br/>So, I guess what I am saying is this movie truly is an original, the best film the Coen Brothers have ever made and maybe the rest roles ever for the three main actors, McDormand, Macy and Buscemi."
"retroman85","10","336","478","11 November 2004"," A masterpiece of Shakesperean proportions
","I've always thought Fargo would make a great Shakesperean play; you could alter the modern elements and still have created a buzz 400 years ago in suburban England. Indeed, the plot is similar to Hamlet's, in that they both have characters we root for who create zany plans than end up spinning wildly out of control into bloodshed. Many people seem to like Fargo for its humorous qualities, its characterization of the Minnesotan culture and Frances McDormand- not me. I love Fargo for its brilliant writing, its tragic musical score, its tragic plot, William H Macy, Harve Presnell and Steve Buscemi, its ignorance of political correctness (how many movies can you remember when the only two minority characters were both revealed to be creeps).I want to draw attention to an overlooked reason why the film works so well - how well the music suits the visuals in this movie. Each murder scene is scored superbly, and other audio clues really add to the effect (for instance, notice how when the police officer asks Carl Showalter ""What's this?"" in reference to the abductee, a disquieting guitar sound is immediately played that has an instantaneous psychological effect on how you interpret the scene). I have seen this film over, well, an embarrassing number of times and have committed its screenplay, from start to finish, by memory. Fargo is the ultimate Coen Brothers movie, a brilliant tragedy, and restores my faith in Roger Ebert as he places this movie in as his fourth favorite movie of the '90s."
"tfrizzell","Null","160","223","25 June 2000"," One of Those Rare Gems in the Cinema
","With all the sorry films these days it is good to see a movie as funny, wicked, dramatic, and utterly demented as ""Fargo"".  It's one of those films that you just have to see.  William H. Macy gives an Oscar-nominated performance as a car salesman who hires two thugs (one a know-it-all-know-nothing and the other a demented psychopath) to kidnap his wife so that he can keep half the ransom from her well-off father. Needless to say nothing goes right and Brainerd sheriff Frances McDormand (in an Oscar-winning role) comes in to save the day.  I won't give anything away because the material is too good to tell those who haven't seen this inventive film.  ""Fargo"" was ranked on the 100 Greatest Films list in 1996 and it was well-deserved.  In this age of by-the-numbers film making, this film was a refreshing flashback to the risk-taking style that made the 1970s such a great decade for movies.  5 stars out of 5."
"paul2001sw-1","7","55","76","13 April 2005"," Cold-hearted
","The Coen brothers' 'Fargo' is nearly a great film: a beautifully shot, blackly comic thriller that quietly subverts every convention of the genre. This is a film where the remote mid-western city of Minneapolis plays the same role as New York in a normal crime story, a hub of civilisation and vice; where the hero is a woman (and a heavily pregnant, happily married woman at that); and the chief villain a car salesman of absolutely no slickness whatsoever. In a final irony, most of the action doesn't even take place in Fargo, but in the even more obscure town of Brainerd. Yet I found it hard to love this film. At brief moments (in depicting the relationship of policewoman Marge, played superbly by Frances McDormaid, and her husband), it feels astonishingly tender, yet at others, it feels as if it is simply making fun of the strange folks from outer America with the wacky accents and absurdly stoical demeanour. And the combination of deadpan acting and frankly silly plot excess sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. Above all else, perhaps, 'Fargo' lacks a beating heart: while nearly moving, and nearly funny, there's a part of this film that refuses to commit itself, that prefers to hold back and mock not just its subjects, but also the idea that a film should take itself seriously. The Coens are widely celebrated as among the best film-makers of our age, but watching their films, I usually end up wondering whether irony is not a slightly over-rated virtue. Fargo looks lovely, and weird, and has a wry outlook all of it's own; but it won't make you laugh out loud, or cry. If it wasn't called a masterpiece I might almost like it."
"bob.gladish","9","76","109","22 January 2005"," Reflections on a second viewing
","This should stand as the Coen brothers' tour de force, although I found  ""The Big Lebowski"" to be an even more satisfying film. I look at  ""Fargo"", ""The Big Lebowski"", and ""Brother, Where Art Thou?"" as being  the Coen's three best movies. I hope there is more from them in the  future that can rival these three; though recent offerings such as  ""Intolerable Cruelty"" and ""The Ladykillers"", could be proving their  peak creativity is behind them.  ""Fargo"" is beyond a doubt, their masterpiece. IMDb's ratings bear this  out - 8.2 for ""Fargo"", 8.0 for ""Lebowski"", and 7.8 for ""Brother"". For  sheer entertainment, ""Lebowski"" or should I call it, ""The Dude"" wins  handsdown, but ""Fargo"" has all the elements of a true classic. Beyond a  doubt, I have never seen such a dramatically-obvious portrayal of good  vs. evil, and never, never, have I seen such gut-wrenching violence.  Oh, the violence, beautifully believable, in it's grotesque way. This  movie is proof that artistic freedom to portray such violence should  never be denied. Steve Buscemi's bullet-grazed face becomes almost as  painful for the watcher as it is for his character; Steve Buscemi's leg  in the wood chipper is as horrific a scene as you are ever going to  see. Enough to give Marge Gunderson morning sickness all over again.  And the good vs evil thing: so obvious in the contrasts between Marge  (the good), Buscemi and Stormare (the evil), and poor Jerry Lundegaard  (William H. Macy) squeamishly caught in a trap in-between. I could only  handle the violence because of Marge. She is the rock of normality, who  continues trumpeting the virtuous life, when all hell is breaking loose  around her. She knows all-to-well that ""you know what"" happens, but  always knows ""you know what"" can be flushed down the toilet. Frances  McDormand, as Marge, deserves every acting award she ever got for this  role. Marge, to me, is the most perfect cop I've ever encountered. She  is polite, non-judgemental, yet able to ask the tough questions that  gets her the information she needs. You can see how thoroughly she  sizes up those she interviews: watching every nuance of their body  language, and hearing ever inflection of their speech. Now here's a  woman who can spot a lie when others can't. Unlike so many cops in  movies, she doesn't have to beat information out of someone; she can  charm it out of them, all the while appealing to their moral  responsibility, no matter how immoral they may be.This is so well-shown  in scenes such as talking to the two young hookers in the bar, and  putting Jerry on the hotseat in the car dealership interrogations.  I elected not to watch some of the scenes on my second viewing.  Somewhat oddly, I skipped almost all the scenes involving Jean  Lundegaard (the kidnapped one) - I couldn't bear to watch what was  happening to this woman, knowing full well her fate. I felt so sorry  for her; she was the true victim in this - the most innocent, yet the  one who suffered the most. I guess a case could also be made that her  son, Scotty, suffered equally, but most of what he went through was not  presented on camera. Maybe he would suffer the most, for he had to live  afterward. Even Marge would suffer from this catastrophe, but you know  her suffering will be tempered by an unwavering belief that good  triumphs over evil. As the last scene shows (Marge getting into bed  with her husband): despite the horrors that might go on around us, we  must seek solace in the everyday beauty of the things that are nearest  and dearest to us all. And this message is conveyed to us all by the  Coen brothers without any allusions to religion whatsoever. But I'm  getting into a personal bias of my own here - if you take solace in  religion playing a part in morality, so be it."
"Ceetee","9","126","195","5 August 1998"," The Coen Brothers come up with another winner.
","With no major stars or well-known names, the actors outshine many more familiar personages.  The story is well thought out.  The criminals don't try to ingratiate themselves with the audience which adds to its reality.  The acting is most convincing and the writing is excellent.  Even the cold of a North Dakota winter comes across.  Every film course should make use of this movie to demonstrate how to make a very good film without relying on a bottomless budget."

","If you haven't seen this movie, do yourself a favour and see it. It is very well put together and the plot is constantly evolving into a deeper shade of creepiness. At times scary (not in the horror movie sense) and quite rich in dark humour, this is one of those movies that gives you a weird felling inside even an hour after its over. The music is quite appropriate and unlike Scarface, is timeless. The camera work is usually quite basic but whoever directed the photography had the enjoyable habit of giving us interestingly artistic segways between scenes. This is the first film so far that I've given a 10 out of 10. I was going to give it a 9, but I couldn't think of a reason to take any points from perfect."
"lestewart","7","57","85","6 September 2004"," Okay, but what was the fuss all about? Accents??
","I saw this film in 2004, long after the Oscar buzz had died down. I suppose it's a victim of its own hype. I enjoyed the film, but it seemed somehow smaller than I expected. Frances McDormand's Oscar-winning performance seems so trivial, seen through the perspective of eight years. The story is okay, though I again wonder about the Oscar the Coens received. (The 1996 Oscars were a somewhat weak field.) I spent most of the movie wondering if people in Minnesota and the Dakotas really talk that way, or is ""Fargo"" as much a travesty of regional accents as most ""southern"" movies are? Overall, the whole film was a nicely filmed, tight little story with apparently overdone regional ironies."
"jmholmes-73727","10","8","9","27 April 2019"," BANALITY OF EVIL VS. BANALITY OF GOOD
","The eternal conflict between good and evil is played out here against the backdrop of a bitter cold American landscape. A group of quirky, ruthless criminals eventually find themselves pursued by a very pregnant cop and her unassuming colleagues. With the Coen brothers at the helm, the audience gets equal doses of humor and violence - often simultaneously - and finally feels awestruck by the simple goodness of Marge and her sweet-tempered husband. This is the movie that should have won the Oscar in '97 but lost to The English Patient which had lots of snob appeal, the one thing Fargo lacked - for sure. It would take years for the Academy to make up for their error by awarding the statuette to the Coen's No Country For Old Men, one of the rare times when the best picture winner actually WAS the year's best picture. Fargo May have lost that year, but one thing it did win was the gratitude of many film-goers for the gift of a wonderfully entertaining crime movie."

"Cpartak","9","32","46","5 April 2005"," Excellent Film
","Fargo is one of my favorite films of all time and in my opinion deserves to be in the top 10 films of the 90's. From the onset of the movie, with views of the snow covered North Dakota landscape and the beautiful and haunting music of composer Carter Burwell playing in the background until the very last scene, Fargo never lets up. This film is Joel and Ethan Cohen's masterpiece, a truly original and one of a kind work. Every aspect of the film is handled with the utmost precision and care. The screenplay, written by Joel and Ethan, is in my opinion flawless. The dialog is at times serious and at other times hilarious, but most importantly always real and believable. The screenplay would be worth nothing, however, without the superb cast of the film that truly makes the characters come to life. Frances McDormand is perfect as the pregnant sheriff who is assigned to the murder case involving Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare. Steve Buscemi is excellent as always, playing a sleazy kidnapper who is perfectly described in one of the best lines of the film as simply ""funny looking - in a general kind of way"". The best performance, however, comes from William H. Macy who is absolutely brilliant as a desperate man who has everything to lose. Macy completely envelops himself in the role and captures perfectly the essence of a broken man whose world is crumbling all around him. The final scene in the motel when he is caught is incredibly powerful because Macy makes you feel the pain and sorrow that a man must feel when he knows that he's going to prison for the rest of his life.<br/><br/>One of the things that I loved about this film is the colorful characters that are a trademark of every Cohen brothers film. In Fargo, these characters include dim witted hookers, psychopath kidnappers, a very pregnant sheriff, and a lot of snow. No matter how long or brief these characters are on the screen, however, they are all incredibly entertaining and fun to watch. That is one of the reasons that I enjoy films by the Cohen brothers. They have a great style and sense of humor that is all their own. They aren't afraid to be different from the Hollywood norm, and they make films on their own terms. Also, as evidenced by this film, they do a great job of getting the best out of every actor. I personally feel that William Macy and Frances McDormand have never been better before or since Fargo. I urge everyone to see this film and compare it to other great works of the last decade. I think you'll find that its place is right near the likes of Pulp Fiction, L.A. Confidential, The Usual Suspects and other great 90's films."

","Joel Coen the director of ""Fargo"", proves he is one of our best directors with this tale of deception and murder told in a style that takes humorous turns in the action. ""Fargo"" is one of the best American films of the nineties. Joel Coen working together with his brother, Ethan, have made pictures that will be viewed as classics, as time will tell. Their movies are always an excellent way to spend some time because they always manage to deliver, even in films that aren't popular with the public.<br/><br/>A lot of what makes this film work is the amazing casting feat the Coen brothers achieved in giving Frances McDormand and William H. Macy, two of our best film actors, prominent presence in it. The Marge Gunderson of Ms. McDormand is one of the best creations the Coen brothers have produced. The same can be said of William H. Macy's take on the pathetic Jerry Lundergaard, the idiotic man who sets things in motion in the film. Ms. McDormand and Mr. Macy have only one scene together, yet one wouldn't even think about other actors playing these roles.<br/><br/>The supporting cast of ""Fargo"" is a joy to watch. Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare make two of the most enjoyable bad guys in memory. These two scum bags are a joke. Anyone in his right mind wouldn't entrust either Carl or Gaer for a hit job. John Carroll Lynch plays Norm, the stoic man who is married to Marge. Harve Presnell is good as Wade Gustafson.<br/><br/>The atmosphere created by the Coens work well. We are constantly reminded of the deep winter seasons of the area where the action takes place. They have given their characters a local flavor and even to hear them talk would take us to that region of the country.<br/><br/>""Fargo"" is a joy to watch thanks to Joel and Ethan Coen."

","Even people I know who can't stand the Coen Brothers' style *love* this slyly low-key comedy-thriller. Unlike so many ""offbeat"" movies, the quirkiness of FARGO's Oscar-winning screenplay never cancels out its warmth or suspense as the Coens deftly balance clever plotting (*not* really based on a true story, as a poor disturbed Japanese woman found out when she came to the U.S. to dig up the hidden ransom money only to freeze to death trying), engaging characters, scares, poignancy, and the brothers' trademark loopy humor. Darkly hilarious as the kidnappers' bungling is, it renders the violence all the more chilling; one minute you're laughing, the next minute you're cringing over the shock of sympathetic characters meeting swift, bloody deaths. I found myself feeling terribly sorry for poor, sweet, unsuspecting Jean Lundegaard (Kristin Rudrud), her vulnerable adolescent son Scotty (Tony Denman), her wealthy father Wade (a delightfully bombastic Harve Presnell), and the other poor slobs unwittingly caught up in car salesman Jerry Lundegaard's plot to get money out of Wade by hiring two thugs to kidnap wife Jean and hold her for ransom, not factoring in the kidnappers' lack of both patience and anger management skills. Nobody plays losers like William H. Macy, and he sure deserved his Best Supporting Actor nomination for playing Jerry, who ought to have his picture in the dictionary next to the word ""inept."" Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare are letter-perfect as the loose-cannon wife-snatchers; if Buscemi isn't our generation's Peter Lorre, I don't know who is. But the heart and soul of FARGO is Frances McDormand, who truly earned her Best Actress Oscar here. Looking a bit like a young brunette Carol Burnett, McDormand is beyond superb as Marge Gunderson, the pregnant sheriff (my husband always liked the fact that FARGO doesn't include the nigh-obligatory scene of The Pregnant Heroine Suddenly Going Into Labor At The Worst Possible Time) who runs circles around the bad guys *and* her own well-meaning police force. Courteous and smart, down-to-earth yet slick, her luminous blue-green eyes never missing a thing, McDormand's Marge comes off as a warm Minnesota (is that an oxymoron? :-) female hybrid of Joe Friday and Lt. Columbo (I mean Columbo's stealth smarts, not his sloppiness :-). If you love FARGO, you owe it to yourself to own the deluxe DVD, chock full of way-cool extras too nifty and numerous to go into here -- oh, yah! :-)"

Every character is genuine, believable, and Home, not Hollywood, spun. The suspense rolls in and out like a San Francisco fog. The side shows that are built in are amazing (sheriff's conversation at a bar with old acquaintance - stamp conversations - breakfast makings). The whole film is an American Shakesphere. I actually know frequent moviegoers who have not seen Fargo (and Sling Blade and Shine). I feel a special sorrow for them. Back to Fargo, every time I watch it I don't want it to ever end. I even sometimes find myself wishfully thinking I could move up there, it's a Lake Wobegone, and then the movie would never end.

And I've listened to friends discuss how creative and wonderful the film is.  But none of this, I repeat, NONE OF THIS, is apparent in this movie.  What I watched was a film confused at whether to be serious or comedic.  And in making up its mind, both elements are fused together in a twisted fashion with an out-of-place Canadian humor.  <br/><br/>Basically the story is about a car salesman who needs cash...fast, so he pays a couple of guys to kidnap his wife so that her rich father will pay the ransom, thereby getting him the cash he needs.  Well, all goes to hell as the kidnappers end up on a killing spree with a cop questioning all possible leads, including the car salesman himself.<br/><br/>If in fact this film was based on a true story (as indicated at the beginning), I would be horrified if I were close to one of the victims.  The Coen brothers make a strange mockery out of the deaths of the victims portrayed and deter the audience from taking the film seriously, instead giving them a quasi-mental hypothermia with the serious/humorous dichotomy. And even if this film is not based on a true story, it is so poorly directed that I just felt like I had wasted my time going around in circles.  But yet I'll walk out my front door and everyone will still be applauding this satirical trash.  Sigh.  What did I miss here?!"

","FARGO (1996) **** Frances McDormand, William H. Macy, Steve Buscemi, Harve Presnell, Peter Stormare.  Dark comic undertones and excellent character actor performances dominate this richly macabre crime story gone awry flick by the Coen brothers(Joel and Ethan) involving pathetic used car salesman Macy so hard up for money and respect (not necessarily in that order) that he hires a pair of dim-witted thugs to kidnap his wife for ransom from his father-in-law's vast wealth in a plot-line that unravels with nice little twists and snags.  McDormand (Best Actress) is perfect as a pregnant Midwestern sheriff on the case with a no-nonsense and homespun effect with her tactics of crime solving.  Great cinematography by Roger A. Deakins accentuates the bleak winterscape of unearthed uneasiness.  Nominated for Best Supporting Actor Macy, Best Director, Best Cinematography and Academy Award winner for Best Original Screenplay."

","What is it about these movies from the Coen brothers which appeals to so many people? How can anyone enjoy a slow paced, over-the-top acted borefest with an impressive collection of the most annoying personalities available. Movies which don't seem to go anywhere despite the fact that there is plenty of story to go about. It must be something masochistic which I don't get.<br/><br/>Fargo.<br/><br/>Surely none of the characters are real life persons but yet I'm not watching a cartoon. None of the dialog seems to be of this Earth, yet I'm not watching a re-enactment of our planet by the inhabitants of Planet KzOrp. So I can only imagine that I'm watching a comedy or at least a movie with an attempt at humor. I mean, what else could it be? It's too preposterous to be a thriller and the characters and the screenplay are too bizarre to make it a drama. <br/><br/>I must have been misinformed about this genre of film. Because it has always been my understanding that a comedy had something to do with laughter and amusement. A ridiculous situation could become quite funny, but truly not when the whole movie is ridiculous as well. Same goes for the abominable, hateful characters.<br/><br/>If the movie Groundhog Day, arguably amongst the best comedies ever made, was made by the Coen brothers, they would have had the entire village reliving the same day over and over again. And not only that, they would have made every character in that movie be twice as arrogant (Murray), dorky (Larry) and desirable (MacDowell) etc. Its result would be the a monstrosity of a caricature .<br/><br/>This movie lacks everything what Groundhog Day makes a good comedy; namely finesse, subtlety and something which makes the viewer not being alienated from the characters and above all, something actually funny going on. (Since when is a kidnapping and a lot of deaths a funny setting? Because Buscemi and Macy are in it?..give me a break, this is hardly Pulp Fiction)<br/><br/>For a crime/thriller based on actual fact, it lacks a seriousness and perhaps even respect to the events that have taken place. And the lack of means of time-travel aside, watching Fargo, I was expecting Jeff Bridges to walk onto the set looking for his stupid rug which would have been my longed for queue to press the eject button.<br/><br/>So all in all it is not a comedy, it is not a crime/drama/thriller but simply a Coen production. To me it's just an incredibly annoying in-between-genre film which cannot decide what it's supposed to be. Therefore it misses the mark on all counts which make the redeeming qualities of the production (and there are a lot) seem sadly wasted.<br/><br/>But it seems to be the minority opinionthe bandwagon ride is so comfy.."
"Dr_J","1","88","164","27 June 2003"," Could have been good, but just plain annoying.
","I can only classify this film as a missed opportunity. While it did have a good storyline, worthy of a film noir, and some very good performances, especially by William H. Macy (you can almost see him crumbling under the weight of not just his crimes, but his cover-ups as well), it is tainted by the Coen brothers' directorial style.  What made it intolerable for me was the amount of ""quirkiness"" that was injected into every single character, scene, and situation. Taken alone, each little quirk is not a big deal, but after so many of them, one after another, it just gets too much to stomach.<br/><br/>Some examples...<br/><br/>The title: The movie takes place mostly in Minneapolis (which isn't quirky enough -- that's where the Mary Tyler Moore Show took place, after all), and Brainerd (and nobody would go see a movie called ""Brainerd""). About 5 minutes of screen time were set in Fargo, and Fargo has a quirky-enough sound.<br/><br/>""True"" story: Just because a story is true, does that make it a better story? There is both good and bad fiction and non-fiction. So, what is gained by lying about whether a story is true or not? Quirkiness! See, if you believe this story is true, then all this quirkiness must be true too!<br/><br/>Names: Character names were given as Grimsrud, Lundegaard, Showalter and Gunderson. Apparently, Scandinavian-sounding names (especially with a double-a) are much quirkier than Pryce, Lopez, Rossi and Sheppard.<br/><br/>The weather: The snow and the cold serve no purpose but to make the characters put on parkas and snow boots, which make them look quirky. For instance, when the policeman was talking with the man shoveling his driveway, and had to put his hood up so far you couldn't see his face. Quirky! However, anyone who lives in a cold climate knows that when the sky is that grey and the snow is as wet as the stuff he was shoveling, it isn't all that cold...<br/><br/>Accents: Whether or not people actually talk ""like that"", what's the point of everyone talking like some country bumpkin, even the ones in the fairly large city of Minneapolis? Accents: quirky. No accents: not quirky.<br/><br/>Pregnancy: Apart from making the lead character wobble when she walked, and to give her a convenient excuse to throw up every once in a while, what exactly was the point of making the police chief pregnant? Ah yes, another quirk.<br/><br/>The old friend: A cop meeting an old high school flame at a bar. Sounds kinda dull, right? Well, let's quirk it up a bit. Make the cop a woman -- no, wait: a pregnant woman. Make the guy Oriental. Make it totally unnecessary to the plot. Now we're talkin' quirky!<br/><br/>By the time we get to the end, we're almost surprised that Macy's character sold plain old GM cars instead of Austin Minis or VW Beetles. The whole thing feels like the directors had no confidence in the subject matter, so they slathered on layer after layer of quirks in the hope the audience wouldn't notice.<br/><br/>In the end, it just becomes an exercise in frustration, as a movie that had everything going for it just turns you off after one wink and a poke in the ribs too many."
"MacAindrais","9","13","19","4 December 2005"," A freezing fable of stupidity
","Fargo: ***.5*<br/><br/>Fargo is a strange little movie. It is, in my opinion, the Cohen Brothers best film. It deals with a very serious subject, yet somehow it does so without taking itself overly serious. There is a very realistic quality to be found here- The subject matter is dark, yet there is a crack of light shining through always. The conversations are spot on with how they would probably be spoken in real life. <br/><br/>McDormands character, the pregnant Marge, is the persistent pursuer but she is not obsessive like so many other movie clichéd 'good guys' are when it comes to catching their adversary. She is involved, but remains detached, just as 95% of real cops will be. You see it clearest in the conversations she has with her fellow officers; husband, and just about everyone else she speaks to. You really feel that she is, as her character says during an interview, just doing her job. This realism is not just present in Marge, but in every character. None are over the top, though the accents are probably slightly exaggerated.<br/><br/>Jerry and his cronies are stupid. We never really find out Jerry's original troubles, but we are front row center for the idiocy that follows. There are no super intelligent characters which you find in many other crime dramas. There is only those who have some wits and common sense, and those who are helplessly daft.<br/><br/>Personally, I loved this movie. It's quirky; it's real; it's charming; and its just plain fun (though bordering on the edge of painful) to watch this freezing fable of stupidity unfold. I did however feel that the ending was a little rushed, but this is not really a bad thing. I felt that the scene of Marge with her friend Mike in the city could have been removed, and that time could have gone to filling out the ending a little more. All in all, this nitpick is rather insignificant, and does little, if nothing at all to distract from the quality of the movie. <br/><br/>I wanted to give this movie a 10, but it is lacking something, i don't know what, which is preventing me from giving it so. I also feel that it deserves more than a nine: 9.5/10"

","This slow-paced movie is really surprising in the way that it put an effort to show how things can go wrong when stupid, unexperienced people are tumbling in crime world. I loved how Cohen brothers unraveled a very well written plot that lead to an unsurprising end but close to how it ends in real life when these misdeeds are committed.
One of the other feeling that transmit this movie is that everything that is happening looks so normal that it creates a strange atmosphere, burlesque, 
 almost stupid, that makes the movie really funny to watch. 
So if you add all those things together plus a really good casting and filmmaking you've got a must see movie !!"
"almafuerte-1","Null","59","113","12 September 2010"," I just can't say anything good about this movie.
","I have written a few reviews on IMDb, and this is the first time I feel compelled to write a negative one. <br/><br/>8.4 IMDb score. Really?<br/><br/>Just don't watch this movie. You are not getting those 90 minutes back, and you will really retreat it. <br/><br/>Steve Buscemi is awesome as usual, but otherwise the movie just falls apart. <br/><br/>The movie is slow, boring, and it makes no sense whatsoever. I understand it's based on a real story, but it's been adapted poorly (or not adapted at all). The side stories add nothing to the main plot (if there is such a thing in this film), and they are added in such a way that make them look like editing mistakes. It actually looks like they mixed their reels and just pasted things from other films. <br/><br/>Besides that, there is no conflict. Just a lot of characters that are truly stupid, make all kind of mistakes, and most end up dead or imprisoned.<br/><br/>(warning, spoilers ahead)<br/><br/>There are several clearly connected crimes. So the investigator, who is a colorless boring character, just plays it exactly by the book and finds the killers immediately. There is just no story. She goes to the crime scene, everything is bloody obvious, so she just makes a few calls, interviews two people, and finds out she has to go to a nearby city. She goes there, and finds the killers who happen to have the car just parked outside waiting to be found. But before doing that, she stops to meet a creepy Asian guy that she hasn't seen for a long time that wants to bang her, but she says no and goes away. <br/><br/>Yes, that is the actual plot. <br/><br/>On the side, you see a lot of terminally stupid criminals doing everything wrong, a desperate guy that needs money, but WHY is never explained, so he makes a lot of blatantly obvious mistakes and ends up in jail. <br/><br/>I can't even begin to explain why the movie is so bad, because it doesn't even deserve much explanation. There is no conflict, no story, no characters. Just a lot of stupid people that kill each other in the most meaningless ways."

Its a wonderful project, just wonderful in its way, but also sad in the implied tightness behind the decisions you see.<br/><br/>What they've done is frayed the garment on the inside. Everything is sparse, bleak. All the camera setups are overly simplified, all the emotional mechanics understated.

","Okay, I know I have just made more enemies than I can count.  But, I ask, what is so funny about Fargo?  Really, I never laughed through the whole movie, ever.  I have a really twisted sense of humor, but anything can make me laugh.  I loved O' Brother Where Art Thou.  I loved Happy Gilmore.  I loved Clerks.  I loved Dr. Strangelove.  I loved Blazing Saddles.  So there, I love a very diverse amount of comedies.  But I did not love Fargo.<br/><br/>First off, the accents.  People say that these Wisconsin accents are hilarious.  Well, they're not.  I grew up in the South, okay.  I have never met a person with a Wisconsin accent in my life.  But I do see them in movies and on TV a lot.  These are just normal accents.  There is nothing satirical about them.  They aren't that funny.  Get over it.<br/><br/>Okay, the plot.  Is it just me or is the plot to this movie mediocre and boring?  It's an average crime movie.  I know crime movies.  That's my forte, you could say.  My favorite movie genre is crime (Pulp fiction, Leon, Reservoir Dogs, The Usual Suspects, Heat, etc...).  But this movie is just an average movie.  The plot is pretty predictable too.  I could have guessed the entire movie from the word go.<br/><br/>Now, I will give credit where credit is due.  The movie isn't all bad.  The acting is good.  The dialog is quick and edgy.  The writing is intelligent. And the direction is sharp and nice.  But there is nothing funny, groundbreaking, or remotely interesting about this movie.<br/><br/>Okay, one last gripe.  If you haven't seen the movie, avert thy eyes, because the ending is about to be told.  Okay, you still here?  Good, I warned you.<br/><br/>The wood chipper scene is one of the most famous scenes in the history of movies, or so it has become.  Honestly, I see nothing funny about it.  It's not that I'm against throwing people into wood chippers.  I liked Evil Dead 2.  Gore doesn't bother me.  But what is so damn funny about throwing a human corpse into a wood chipper?  It makes sense to me.  If you wanted to dispose of a body and a wood chipper is near by, well hey! IDEA!  THROW IT IN!  But is it funny?  Not really.  Is it gory? No.  Is it bad?  No.  But is it deserving of being called one of the greatest scenes ever?  HELL NO!<br/><br/>I am really trying to understand people's love of this movie.  I wasn't the biggest fan of The Blues Brothers, but I understand why people love it. Fargo isn't funny, nor is it very interesting.  The acting is the only thing that kept me interested.  I love W.H. Macy.  All the actors and actresses are good in this movie.  But is this movie the work of genus that people make it out to be?  No, ohhhhhhhhhh God no. <br/><br/>In conclusion: This movie is an ""okay"" movie.  There's nothing bad about it, but it isn't great.  I hate it when people make movies out to be better than they really are.  I found The Untouchables, The Blues Brothers, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Being John Malkovic, and Fargo to all be overrated movies.  They're not bad, they're just not great, or even that good either. (ESPECIALLY CROUCHING TIGER!)  People, please join me in the crusade to bring the truth out and bring down the overrated movies!<br/><br/>My rating: 5/10<br/><br/>PS:  Go ahead, send the hate mail.  I welcome it."
"st-shot","10","7","10","23 May 2009"," Fargo is Flawless
","Fargo is probably the last American Film masterpiece of the Twentieth Century and the last 25 years. Highly original and imaginative it is a depressing tale told in a dark comic style with flesh and blood characters intricately and smoothly connected with dialog and plot twists all brilliantly conceived by the brothers Coen.<br/><br/>Sleazy car dealer Jerry Lundergaard hatches a plan to have his wife kidnapped so he can pocket some of the ransom his emasculating father in-law will have to fork over. Through one of his mechanics he gets the name of a low life who might be interested and travels to Fargo to work out the plan. Things go awry from the outset though and soon the cold snowy landscape is littered with dead bodies. Solving the case is left up to a last trimester pregnant Sheriff from Brainerd, Minnesota who initially comes across as a little slow on the draw.<br/><br/>Fargo is flawlessly constructed with subplots girding the storyline, enriching characterization and sharply calibrating the suspenseful pace. The frozen north setting is a refreshing change from big city and vacation land locales that dominate feature films and the Coens expertly put it to use to create mood, evoke humor and accent imagery. It is the best use of snow since Altman's McCabe and Mrs. Miller.<br/><br/>William Macy as Jerry takes the car salesman stereotypes to new lows with one of the most memorable cloyingly unctuous characters in film history as he dismantles his family in pursuit of wealth. Whether trying to tack on extras to customers or keeping police at bay while surrounded in a motel room he remains steadfast in deceptive practice until the end. As the Sheriff Frances McDormand evolves from small town cop to Colombo subtlety and successfully without fanfare while Coen economically brings more depth and mystery to her with dry comic snapshots of her married life and a meeting with an old school chum. As one of the blundering kidnappers Steve Buscemi is a motormouth of comic complaint while his taciturn, hypochondrial partner played by Peter Stomare (a lot more grounded in reality than the Frankenstein creation running amok in the Coen's No Country for Old Men) is icily terrifying.<br/><br/>Fargo is the Coens' best film to date. They fell into a malaise after The Big Lebowski with heavy handed comedies (The Lady Killers, Intolerable Cruelty), dependence on charming movie star George Clooney as well as a flaccid and forgettable foray into black and white (The Man Who Wasn't There) before going Oscar with the slow moving overrated Old Country, followed by the praise worthy acerbic screwball comedy Burn After Reading. Even with their failures they had more to offer than quality work of tamer directors by offering razzle dazzle camera work and original off-beat characters. Taking chances they sometimes pushed the envelope beyond credulity but with Fargo they give us a perfect measure of style and realism with a dark comic soul that is rich in detail and perception of this thing known as the human comedy."
"moviesleuth2","10","7","10","26 April 2009"," A Black Comedy/Thriller from The Coen Brothers...Need I say more?
","Going into a Coen brothers movie expecting something traditional is ridiculous by any stretch of the imagination. Any movie directed by the Coens is going to be severely warped in one way or another, either by approach (""No Country for Old Men"") or by their sense of humor (everything else).<br/><br/>By all accounts, ""Fargo"" is a murder mystery, though it is anything but straightforward. This is not ""Law & Order."" It's about a simple crime that spiraled way out of control for all the principal characters. That's understandable, since everyone populating this story is either hopelessly inept or hopelessly stupid.<br/><br/>Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) is a car salesman who needs money to open a new car lot. But since he thinks that the only person who could give the money to him, his father-in-law (Harve Presnell), won't put down the money, he hires two thugs (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wife (Kristen Rudrud) and split the ransom that his father-in-law will pay. Unfortunately for Jerry, the two thugs he hired don't have any brain cells between them, and Jerry is probably the most incompetent criminal the world has ever seen. Things get out of hand very quickly and the bodies start piling up. This draws the attention of the very pregnant Police Chief Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand).<br/><br/>It may seem like I've given a lot away, but really, I haven't. That's just the set-up for a series of unexpected (not to mention bizarre) twist and turns that the Coens throw at us. Many thrillers, even the best ones, have easily projected paths. ""Fargo"" is anything but.<br/><br/>Despite IMDb listing it as such, merely calling ""Fargo"" a crime/thriller is an insufficient description. The film is as much a comedy as anything else. From the character's stupidity or complete ineptitude, to the funny accents and way of speaking that everyone has, the Coens never take ""Fargo"" too seriously.<br/><br/>The acting is the best part of the film. Frances McDormand is a real scene-stealer, and in many ways the best part of the movie. Marge is relentlessly chirpy and optimistic, and she's easily the smartest character in the film (although that's not exactly saying much). ""Fargo"" really takes off whenever she's on screen. William H. Macy gives his best performance as Jerry. As reprehensible as his plan is, you can't help but feel sorry for the guy. He's so bad at being a criminal, it's really pathetic. But seeing him try to get out of the jams he gets himself into are nothing short of hilarious. Steve Buscemi and Harve Presnell are good as the brainless kidnappers, and even though they think they're smart, they're really, REALLY dumb.<br/><br/>Joel Coen has a knack for twisting the story just enough so that it's funny without lampooning the genre. This isn't a satire, but the jabs it takes almost make it so. It has its share of violence, including a scene that in any other movie would be completely sick and disturbing, but as told by the Coens, it's so shocking and absurd that it's laugh-out-loud hilarious.<br/><br/>Roger Ebert heaped tons of praise on ""Fargo,"" saying that ""Movies like 'Fargo' are the reasons why I love movies."" While I greatly enjoyed ""Fargo,"" I can't heap that much praise on it. Some of the cuts in the film are too long, and I half-expected a commercial break. Additionally, there's one scene where Marge reunites with a guy from high school that, while funny and irreverent, really doesn't add anything to the story. Still, it's enjoyable enough that it's hardly worth complaining about.<br/><br/>While it may not be perfect, ""Fargo"" is still a very good film, especially if you have a warped sense of humor."

What they can't achieve with excellent dialogue, well-spun stories, and logical continuity in plotting, the Coens make up for via blood, lust, more blood, and then more blood. Vanquished from their movies is any sense of humanity or hope, and we are left in what I can best describe as a ""bleakscape"" - where the great positive is the presence of so much that is negative. I do delight, however, in the spectacle of reading swooning fans' fawning tributes to the Coens' ""films"" (and yes, their fans will watch only ""films"").<br/><br/>Utterly unbelievable in the bleak, depressing, and joyless tableaux they offer, the Coen films are the perfect answer to a society full of soulless narcissists."

But it isn't that kind of movie. It draws you in, the dialog and editing are so good, you want to keep watching. And so I did. It deserves its high rating.<br/><br/>some SPOILERS follow, don't read further if you haven't seen ""Fargo"" yet.<br/><br/>
Bill Macy is perfect, absolutely, as ""Jerry"" the car sales manager who can't quite get his life in order. You see, Jerry basically cares only about himself. He has some unspecified debt, his father in law (Harve Presnell) is rich but has a very low, deservedly, opinion of Jerry. So Jerry does the only thing he can figure, through a paroled  American Native car mechanic that works in his dealership gets hooked up with two thugs (Buscemi and Stormare) who will kidnap Jerry's wife, hold her safe, until Jerry convinces pop-in-law to pay a ransom, which he uses to pay off the thugs and erase his own debt. Ever the schemer, Jerry tells the thugs he will split $80,000 with them, but really plans to extort $1Million and just give them $40,000. In an early scene to establish character, we see Jerry scamming a customer by charging him for a ""topcoat"" treatment that he said a day earlier he would throw in free. Jerry was simply a very flawed person.<br/><br/>Things go terribly wrong, thugs get stopped at night in the snow, Stormare shoots the cop, plus two passers by who are tracked down after witnessing the crime scene. Margie (Frances McDormand, oscar winner) is the town sheriff and gets on the trail. She calmly travels to the Twin Cities, interviews people, pieces together clues, finds the hideout near the lake, comes upon Stormare grinding up Buscemi's body, the dead hostage in the cabin. In the interim the father in law gets gunned down, as well as a parking lot attendant. <br/><br/>This film is best classified as a very dark comedy. Margie and her fisherman husband are two of the very few normal people in this film, The others - Jerry, his family, the mechanic, the thugs, the prostitutes - are all way off center, and some of the situations and dialog are very funny, within the context of a film where a number of murders are committed. The funniest scene is during the shooting of Presnell, who wounds Buscemi on the right cheek, and he spends the rest of the film with rather large strips of paper stuck to his face to stop the bleeding, his hands and coat collar red and blood-soaked. I mean, there's really nothing funny about murder, but the Buscemi character is very funny."

","Evil as depicted in films such as ""Fargo"" and ""Badlands"" is much more disturbing than in films in which evil geniuses or devilish fiends systematically carry out their plans. In ""Fargo"" unintelligent evil is matched against seemingly ordinary good people as embodied by Frances McDormand and good wins hands down. And it's not just a case of good defeats evil by catching and punishing it. That's the genius of this film. Enjoying the ordinary life shines through in Margie's relationship with her husband and the film does not patronize their homespun but genuine affection. Margie's comment to the dimwitted murderer about it being a beautiful day and ruining it over ""a little bit of money"" rings true because of the regrettably ridiculous tangle of folly caused by greed and insensitivity that has preceded it. Margie's final comment to her husband that they are ""doing pretty good"" is perfectly in keeping with the tale and its tone. Brutality has been beaten by simple human decency but with no overt sentimentality or grandly moral speechifying.<br/><br/>This is a depiction of humankind at their worst and their best.

","I love most coen brothers films but even the ones I love have that one awful part to them, the supernatural unexplained arty farty scenes (The biker in raising arizona, the devil & the flood in oh brother, the ufo in the man who wasn't there, etc) I find them to be the low points in every one of their films. Fargo either missed that obstacle or the entire film consisted of a variation of it, either way it failed me from the first 5 minutes I was unhappy with this film. Just stripped down simple times in a simple place with complicated deadly themes. Disregard the value of life and be entertained. Art? yes lots of art, if you want to think it's there.. This movie should not have been the staple for the Coen brothers, people hold this movie in such high regard it just makes me think they are just wanting to sound smart because they only had to watch it twice to understand it. That and Wood chipper wood chipper wood chipper.. Yes I always hear the talk about the wood chipper scene, over & over, maybe the highlight of the film? wow.. so sad.. This film is nothing but a basic simple life town with wood chipper shock value. Bring up Fargo in a coversation & you will hear the words ""wood chipper"" within five seconds.."

","When it was released in 1996, ""Fargo"" met public and especially critical acclaim and collected several rewards. But I think that if the Prize for the Best Directing at the Cannes festival was absolutely justified, on the other hand, Frances McDormand didn't deserve her Oscar in 1997. William H.Macy should have won it. His performance as an hypocritical and dishonest car seller is powerful and unforgettable.<br/><br/>What is amazing in ""Fargo"" are the landscapes, the sceneries and above all the characters. The Coen brothers said about the movie: "" the landscapes, the sceneries are an integral part of the movie. They are typical of the Midwest as well as the characters with their sensitivity and their mentality"". They know what they are talking about since they come from the Midwest, more precisely from the Minnesota. As a consequence, they must have been at ease by making this thrilling movie.<br/><br/>Concerning the characters, they are the subject of a realistic and down-to-earth description. Each of them has a different but not very status-enhancing characteristic: William H.Macy's cues are almost always hesitating, unfinished or unsure, the two gangsters are just silly guys (one of them nearly never talks) and most of the inhabitants including Frances McDormand are narrow-minded. By this way, the Coen brothers wanted to underline their meanness of mind and the fact that they are firmly rooted in their land of the Minnesota.<br/><br/>Apart from the characters and although the movie is based on a true story, I am obliged to recognize that the script and the way the movie is designed have nothing new. But nonetheless, the tone is daring, there's black humor cleverly used (notably in bloody moments) that contrasts with a quiet even neutral directing. As for the snowy landscapes, they will later inspire Sam Raimi for ""a simple plan"" (1998), a movie as successful as ""Fargo"".<br/><br/>""Fargo"" is eventually the finest movie made by the Coen brothers and its place in the top 250 is thoroughly justified."

","""Films like ""Fargo"" are why I love the movies"", said Roger Ebert. The film-makers Joel and Ethan Coen, the writing/directing team also known as Two Headed Director, are the reason why I believe in the modern movie-making. To take the story like the one Fargo is based on which has been told so many times before and, I am sure, will be told over and over again, to turn and twist it in the most in-anticipated ways, to create the characters so alive and three dimensional that you believe every word they say and every step they take, to provide them with some of the best quotes and dialogs I've ever had pleasure to hear, to mix dry humor and humanity, to make the film recognizable but uniquely beautiful, dark, dramatic, and funny - that's what Coens achieved in Fargo which has been supposedly the Best film they ever made. <br/><br/>All of Coens' fans have their own favorite film but it is hard to disagree that with Fargo, Coens sealed the place in Cinema Hall of Fame. Fargo is a movie of many dimensions. As many of Coens' films, it centers on a botched crime that includes kidnapping gone terribly wrong. Many viewers see it as a dark comical crime/mystery thriller which it is but it is much more. It rises to the high tragedy, and it is one of the most beautiful gentle love stories committed to screen which is very unusual for Coens. What I especially love in Fargo - the perfect balance between the scenes of building suspense, graphic violence, humor, and the real drama from the lives of the real people.<br/><br/>The visual palette of the film with color white dominating the screen is stunning, and the snow that covers American Midwest for what seems the eternal winter, is as important character for the film as the rest of them. The sorrowful music score deserves a special mention for creating the mood. <br/><br/>It has been told a lot about dream cast that Coens gathered for the film. Of all stars, Frances McDormand and William H. Macy got the most recognition, and very deservingly so. Macy is amazing and a spot- on, and in the final scene of the film, genuinely heartbreaking. It is impossible to imagine anybody else in the role of Jerry Lundegaard, the desperate man who came up with the perfect scheme to become rich without hurting anyone and whose good intentions paved the road directly to hell of Shakespearean proportions. Macy was determined from the beginning that it was HIS role in spite Coens' doubts even after the second reading. He did not hesitate to beg them, and the result proved absolutely terrific. <br/><br/>Any way we look at Fargo, it is a great work of Cinema that would make it difficult for its creators to overpass its perfection. As a true masterpiece, it only gets better as time passes and it turns with new facets with every new viewing."

"sgtdraino","1","28","60","29 April 2005"," The worst Coen brothers movie
","I am ordinarily a big fan of Coen brothers movies. ""Raising Arizona"" is one of my all-time favorites, and most of their other films are also quite good. Fargo, however, is highly over-rated. I believe it to be their worst film to date. As several others have commented, the film is simply too mean-spirited in its comedy, especially when it purports at the beginning to be a ""true"" story.<br/><br/>The best example I can think of, is the scene in the movie when the wife is tied up inside a sack and the kidnappers are trying to get her into the cabin. She momentarily gets away from them, and runs around in a panicked frenzy, blindly bumping into things, while the kidnappers laugh at her. Believe it or not, in the movie this scene is played for laughs. The movie wants the audience to laugh at this scene, and inevitably some do laugh. Laughing puts the viewer into the same frame of reference as the kidnappers, instead of identifying (as they should) with the victim. As a result, you laugh without thinking, and then feel bad about having just laughed. A very uncomfortable feeling.<br/><br/>Most Coen brothers movies are filled with quirky characters that have a lot of ""heart."" Even the bad guys end up being somewhat likable. In ""Fargo"" however, there are very few likable characters. Marge Gunderson is just about the only one, and even she is really too much of a cartoon caricature to feel like a real person. Yet, at the same time, the movie feels a little too much like real life to be a good dark comedy.<br/><br/>Dark comedies are tricky things, and I do love a good dark comedy. However, I think a dark comedy needs to feel unreal enough, in order to allow us to laugh at the naughty goings-on. Bad things can be funny, if we know they are not real. The more real bad things feel, the less funny they get. ""Fargo"" made the mistake of trying to portray bad things in a very realistic way, and then making fun of them. This contrasts with ""Raising Arizona,"" which portrayed some bad things in an over-the-top cartoonish way, and remained funny. Cartoon violence is funny, real violence is not.<br/><br/>I say, skip this one and watch ""Raising Arizona."""
"jayjaycee","9","2","2","7 February 2020"," McDormand is a queen!
","""Fargo"" is a 1996 (comedic) thriller (officially) directed by Joel Coen starring Frances McDormand and William H. Macy. I gotta admit that I've already watched it roughly one year ago when I had personal issues and was in a bad mood that resulted in a disability to like films in general and that I heavily disliked this film. Now that the worst of my personal problem is over and I'm able to appreciate everything again, I had the strange feeling that I didn't do this film justice and that I had to give it a rewatch and after finding this nice little Mediabook I knew I had to set things straight. Like I expected, this film is actually pretty good. There's so much to cherish in it and I still cannot believe that, as the opening titles state, all these depicted events are based on a true story. It's just insane. What appears to be another brilliant gathering of thoughts of the Coen brothers really happened in 1987. They took it and made it a brilliant comedic thriller. Yes, I say it's a comedic thriller, because overall it might be a thriller, but there too many scenes that feature crude humour that I couldn't leave that part out. Actually, it's undeniable that in it's cold core it's a black satirical crime flick. First of all, the way how the plot is constructed and links several storylines with weird, but original characters is simply superb. It's full of funny running gags, dialogue and it perfectly combines the right amount of abstruse humour and true earnestness. From the wannabe gangster duo, to a desperate car salesman in the need for cash to a pregnant, but still determined police chief there's not a single character that is boring in any way. This cold-blooded thriller features so many outstanding actors and actresses that made them come to life with such an easiness. Leading lady Frances McDormand (who only has had one hour of screentime to again proof that she's the greatest) delivered an ingenious performance as the protagonist police chief. She's such a sweet lady and she dominates every single scene she's in, also the way she speaks is just lovely. Definitely one of the greatest actresses in the business. But let's not forget to praise Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare as the quirky and evilly hilarious kidnappers and William H. Macy as the salesman who also knew to entertain with their weird charisma. Set in a scenery of frozen highways and endless widths of cold snow they all manage to create this unique atmosphere. Also, mostly enabled by the breathtaking cinematography of Roger Deakins. I could seriously feel the cold of the film crawling down my spine although I was sitting in my warm room under my even warmer blanket. It's so beautifully shot and moody that I still cannot understand why it took the Academy more than twenty years to award that man. He's a virtuoso with the camera! All in all, this shockingly beautiful and brutally bloody snow satire is an outstanding entry to the independent cinema, with an inimitable atmosphere and tense music and unbelievably real story lead by a magnificent McDormand. It took me another watch to appreciate this classic flick and feel redemption. Better late than never."

","""There's more to life than a little money, you know. Don'tcha know that? And here ya are, and it's a beautiful day. Well, I just don't understand it."" - Marge Gunderson<br/><br/>Pure genius. Those two words are what best describes Coen Brothers' Fargo. I saw this for the first time, and, I'm happy to say, it ranks up there with The Big Lebowski and No Country for Old Men as one of the Coen's best films with its dark and quirky writing, its gorgeous cinematography, a solid performance from much of the cast, and its mixture of black comedy, violence, and satire that only the Coen Brothers can pull off.<br/><br/>This dark and quirky story begins with Jerry Lundegaard, a down-on-his-luck car salesman who is hard up for money to finance for his family. So, he hires two crooks to kidnap his wife so he can extort a ransom from his father-in-law. The plan seems to be going well, until one minor incident leads to three roadside murders and the plan slowly starts falling apart. In the center of all this craziness is Marge Gunderson, a pregnant police chief who is investigating the murders and she starts to realize that the murders are connected to Jerry's ill-thought out plan.<br/><br/>Despite opening with a disclaimer that this ""based on a true story"", it's not really based on a true story, although it was loosely based on a real life case. But it perfectly sets the tone to the absurdity that is about to unfold. What the Coen Brothers do best is their perfect blend of dark humor, satire, and excessive violence and execute it in a flawless manner. You can't help but to laugh at all of the misfortunes that is happening to the characters, like Carl's short-tempered outbursts when something goes wrong or when Jerry is on the verge of having a nervous breakdown.<br/><br/>I must say that I have to give huge props to the cinematography, courtesy of Roger Deakins. It gives it a seemly peaceful feeling of the snowy Minnesota countryside and the music gives it an old time folk feel that just fits perfectly to the setting. One of my favorite shots is that overhead shot of Jerry walking to his car in the snow-covered parking lot.<br/><br/>The performances from the film's star-studded cast are all excellent. From William H. Macy as the timid Jerry, to Steve Buscemi as the loud, trash talking Carl Showalter, to even Peter Stormare as the emotionless and mostly mute Gaear Grimsrud. But the best of the cast is Francis McDormand as Marge. She's the only character out of all of them that is pleasant, whereas some of them, mainly the crooks, are crazy. She is seen as having a happy and modest life, has a loving and supporting husband, is witty, and, despite the situation that she's in and her life as a police chief, she still maintains her upbeat and ""Minnesota Nice"" attitude.<br/><br/>Overall, Fargo is a genuine classic that manages to rank up to masterpiece-level of quality. Certainly, one of the Coen Brothers' best films.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: 10/10 with the Epic Seal of Awesomeness"

"tieman64","Null","2","2","22 August 2008"," The Straight Story
","""When a film like Fargo is successful, then clearly nothing makes sense."" â€“ Ethan Coen<br/><br/>""The story that follows is about Minnesota. It evokes the abstract landscape of our childhood - a bleak, windswept tundra, resembling Siberia except for its Ford dealerships and Hardee's restaurants. It aims to be both homey and exotic, and pretends to be true."" - Ethan Coen <br/><br/>Jerry Lundegaard (William H Macy) is a car salesman who urgently needs money. Out of desperation he hires two criminals to kidnap his wife, his intention being to extort 1 million dollars from her wealthy father. But in typical noir fashion, his plan falls apart.<br/><br/>This is another tightly wound neo-noir by the Coen brothers, but like David Lynch's ""Straight Story"", it's also a reactionary piece aimed at its audience. Lynch followed up the critically derided ""Lost Highway"" with ""The Straight Story"", a film which pretended to be homey, realistic and ""straight"", when in fact it was a disturbing tale filled with hidden horrors and disguised menace.<br/><br/>""Fargo"" likewise pretends to be a straight story. After audiences and critics scorned the ridiculously cartoonish ""Hudsucker Proxy"", the Coen's released the more somber ""Fargo, presenting it to their audience as a film based on a real event, and using subdued camera work and a great deal of restraint to lend the film a sense of authenticity.<br/><br/>But as Police Chief Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) learns when she meets her old friend Mike Yanagita, things shouldn't be taken at face value. So though touted as a ""serious film"" based on a ""factual event"", ""Fargo"" is really an exercise in seeing how FAR the Coens can GO (hence the title) without cracking up laughing. The film pretends to be based on a true story, when in fact it is a work of fiction borne from the playful minds of the Coens. Virtually every scene is skewed or warped, filled with moments of repressed humour, ridiculous mannerisms and laughably named characters. The con, or joke, is how far the audience is suckered into accepting the on screen follies. This sort of audience contempt would reach nihilistic proportions in the Coen's later films.<br/><br/>8.5/10 - A slick slice of neo-noir, not as inventive or daring as ""The Big Lebowski"", but its simplicity allows it to reach a kind of lean perfection. Still, the film has two flaws. Firstly, all these formalists (De Palma, Mamet, Leone, Tarantino, Coens - Hollywood's reigning post-modernists) always serve up reheated seconds. ""Fargo"" thus works more as a slick photocopy or parody of noir, all the imperfections airbrushed and whittled away by history, the Coens more interested in reproduction and ironic distance, than tapping into something genuine.<br/><br/>The second flaw is the Coen's increasing nihilism. Art's all a big joke, either an unknowing prank on the audience or an invitation for artist and audience to, in tandem, mock the follies of the schmucks on screen. The Coens pretend to deal with tragedy, but rarely do they tap into any kind of affecting sadness."
"MovieAddict2016","10","10","18","14 October 2003"," Quite possibly one of the tn best films of all time...
","There are a great many reasons for the extraordinary success of ""Fargo."" One of the reasons is the uproar it caused upon release when nosy little reporters found out it was not really based on true events like the disclaimer says at the beginning of the film. Then there was the tragedy of the Japanese woman who went looking for the buried stash of money and froze to death. The press had, what movie characters always call, a ""field day"" with this story. They overlooked the fact that she had left behind a suicide note and was informed by police the story was false upon arrival in Minnesota, where she was picked up by a worried police officer. She had a death wish.<br/><br/>And the other reason for success is, of course, because the movie is one of the best of all films--a true ""story"" if ever there was one. It's more than a scathing social satire, more than a dark comedy, more than a great drama with a fabulous story filled with irony and coincedences and morals and so on and so forth. It's more than a great movie. It's superb.<br/><br/>Marge Gunderson has become a sort of cultural character. People quote her like the Terminator or Charles Foster Kane or George Bailey or Darth Vader. She's so famous that I do not think many people realize Marge essentially comes in around forty minutes into the 98-minute movie. Yet that's what people think of when they hear the word ""Fargo""--Marge Gunderson--and so it just shows what an impact a film like ""Fargo"" made. And not only impact, but the remembrance of characters we love to remember.<br/><br/>Marge provides a sort of balance between the wild and the crazy. She is the moral character of the story who juggles the two and tries to keep them from falling. When the film starts to get violent or ironic Marge steps in to sort out the mess. The Coen Brothers, Ethan and Joel, obviously have a firm grasp on the actuality of storytelling as opposed to filmmakers who can simply put a story on screen--ignoring whether it provides any sort of actual storytelling at all.<br/><br/>I think we all remember the first moment Marge wakes up in bed and receives the phone call. She drives out to the barren, frosty highway with a view of Minnesota that stretches for miles, and investigates the crime scene of a most brutal murder. Three people haev been murdered: A cop, and two passersby. The villain(s)? Unknown. (Regarding the killer: ""And by the size of his feet he looks like a big fella'!"")<br/><br/>The murders were, of course, all coincedental, having to do with a simple yet oddly complex plot: Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) has debts he is unable to pay, so he hires two crooks, Carl (Steve Buscemi) and Gaeur (Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wife,  Jean (Kristin Rudrud). Unfortunately, their plan did not go to...er...plan, and they had to kill three people along the way.<br/><br/>The point where Gauer shoots the police officer who has pulled the men over for not displaying the proper tags on their vehicle is funny. And yet when you really think about it, that scene shouldn't be funny at all. But it is. The Coen Brothers know how to make it funny. They are like experts of the dark humor--when Carl says, ""Whoa, Daddy!"" and has that speckle of blood on his face, I always burst out in laughter. It sounds sick, but strangely, it isn't.<br/><br/>The dialogue in ""Fargo"" is just as excellent as the film's twisty little plot. Frances McDormand rightfully won an Oscar for her portrayal of Marge Gunderson. She speaks with the perfect accent of, what the Coen Brothers call, the language ""Minnesota Nice""--where people are always cheery, even when they're being mean. It's just something inbred into citizens of Minnesota. And even when the worst things are happening to characters, you're smiling, because who doesn't love to hear, ""Gee, golly, gee whiz,"" throughout a movie, and who doesn't think it's funny?<br/><br/>""Fargo"" is the type of film you can watch over and over. Sometimes I think to myself that I'm just going to watch a scene or two, but as soon as the credits start the film has my interest and never lets go. It's the odd sort of delightful little film that keeps the viewer's interest for the first time up through the fiftieth time and beyond.<br/><br/>The film's plot takes twist after twist and we can identify ever so much with the character of Jerry as all his well-thought-out plans go to waste, causing his debt to become even worse and his life even more ruined than it already is. Steve Buscemi, as Carl, is just as much a scene-stealer as Marge Gunderson (I love to type that name), and Jerry is just as much a lovable character as someone who hasn't hired two crooks to kidnap his wife. That's the secret to ""Fargo""--or at least part of the secret. We like the characters, simply because we know they don't really mean any harm. Harm just happens to find them.<br/><br/>5/5 stars.<br/><br/><ul><li>John Ulmer</li></ul>"

"MPHopcroft","9","6","10","3 April 2006"," All in the motives
","Fargo isn't a thriller or mystery in the traditional sense, but it is still a truly remarkable piece of film-making and screeenwriting.<br/><br/>Few characters in American film epitomize the banality of evil as thoroughly as Jerry Lundegaard. Jerry's greed causes him to seek opportunities that he is incapable of handling, commit pointless and easily-detectable frauds, and commission one of the most ill-conceived crimes possible. More significantly, he is only capable of thinking of himself, even as the world around him explodes into bloody chaos due to his own actions. The most telling scene is the one where he tries to reassure his son that everything will be all right -- but like everything else he tells people, it's a lie, and a transparent one at that. In his hands, cluelessness becomes a truly monstrous thing that destroys everyone and everything he should care about.<br/><br/>It is the contrast with these qualities that makes Marge such a compelling heroine. A woman who cares about those around her and those she works with, she gives and receives a thousand little kindnesses that repay her tenfold. The murders she must deal with may be a challenge she doesn't want, but she is more than up to it, and displays the determination and savvy, if not the flash and flair, of a great movie sleuth.<br/><br/>It is the contrast in these characters, and the others around them, that makes Fargo such a special film."

We sat through it, then on the way out, I said to him, ""Well, that was weird."" He looked at me and laughed, saying, ""I was just going to say that."" We then promptly forgot about it and started talking about someone else. It seemed like it would have done well as an extended episode of some bizarre TV series along the lines of ""Twin Peaks,"" etc. Something that you would watch once, and then next week, something different would happen with the same characters. But as a self-contained film, well, it's not enough of a story, not enough of a film. The months later, it was nominated for several Oscars, including Best Picture. On hearing that, I thought, ""Wow, Hollywood really liked it."" I have to admit I was rooting for Brenda Blethyn to win the Oscar for ""Secrets and Lies"" as I thought hers was the best performance of the year. So I was let down when Frances McDormand won, not that her performance wasn't award-worthy, just that the wrong person won that year. Thinking I had missed something profound about ""Fargo,"" I rented the DVD when it came out, I think in 2003. This time I could hardly stomach the violence in it.

I very rarely rent R-rated films, but this seemed to be worth it.<br/><br/>In short, my brother and I did not laugh once, nor did we enjoy the film.<br/><br/>First of all, the film is violent and grotesque. I've seen many violent films before, but this went beyond anything I've seen. There are several murders committed. All of them are extremely disturbing in their depiction of blood and guts as well as the complete inhumanity of each killing.<br/><br/>Second of all, the film has numerous moments of gratuitous sex which serve the plot no purpose, other than perhaps additional character degradation.<br/><br/>In my opinion, this film is the second worst thing to happen to mainstream entertainment in the 90s.<br/><br/>The worst thing is that people out there laughed at it. What a blasted hame!"

","Jerry Lundegaard is a car dealer who has money problems.  Unable to ask his wealthy father-in-law for money, Jerry employs two criminal types to kidnap his wife and then split the ransom with Jerry.  However when a cop pulls over the two criminals, a triple shooting is the result and the police get involved.  With Jerry getting pressure from the kidnappers now that thing has gone sour and Officer Marge Gunderson making progress in her investigation, things are far from as straightforward as was originally planned.<br/><br/>Getting past the whole `true story' nonsense, this is easily one of the Coen's most polished films as well as one of their most enjoyable.  The film opens with a bleak, snowy scene with a great sweeping score and pretty much sets the tone for a film that feels bigger than it actually is.  The opening scene between Jerry and his two contracted hoods is really good and is typical of the comic tone that runs all the way through the film.  The plot is cleverly written and so much more than another `job gone wrong' thing, however what drives the film is the weird web of unusual characters that we encounter along the way.  Setting the film in a part of American with Scandinavian roots was clever as it gives the characters funny accents before you even worry about what they are going to say with them!  The screenplay won an Oscar and it deserved it simply for the dialogue and the characters it creates.  It is a dark film but it is one that fans of the Coen brothers' universe will find funny.<br/><br/>Of course it helps no end to have a great cast to deliver it.  McDormand won the Oscar despite only being one of several good performances in the film. Her Marge is funny yet relentless in her pursuit.  Macy is as reliable as ever and it is his increasingly frantic performance that is the best of the film for my money - weedy, pathetic and hopelessly out of his depth but funny with it.  Buscemi and Stormare are both very good for very different reasons and the rest of the support cast is comprised of many strange characters who are funny.  Only the very occasional bit hits a sour note, but this is very occasional and doesn't hurt the film one little bit.<br/><br/>Overall this may not be a true story but that is not to say that it isn't fascinating anyway - who says truth is better than fiction?!  The roundly great performances do great work with a deserved Oscar winner of a screen play that fills a solid crime storyline with all manner of characters that produce a gripping and funny film that is one of the best and most accessible of the Coen brother films."
"DeeNine-2","8","5","8","17 January 2000"," Satirical thriller with atmosphere
","(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)<br/><br/>Fargo is the kind of movie that appeals to people who have seen a lot of movies because everything is surprising and unexpected. The cop's a woman (Frances McDormand). Pregnant. The perps are psychos of course, but there are three of them and each is a different breed of psycho. William H. Macy is a car salesman who dreams up a scheme to cheat his rich father in law out of a million dollars by getting some degenerates to kidnap his wife. He's a white collar sociopath who always lies whenever his lips are moving unless there is some very good reason to tell the truth. One of the degenerates is a big silent guy (Peter Stormare) who kills people as one squishes bugs. The other (Steve Buscemi) is an ugly little bantam who lies and cheats and kills and steals and whines until finally somebody puts him out of his misery.<br/><br/>This is Fargo, North Dakota, where people are country and it's cold and not very sophisticated. The movie makes gentle fun of the locals while guiding us to identify with them. McDormand eats a whole lot of Hardee's and Arby's and greasy dishes from the cafeteria piled high on her plate. She's eating for two. She loves her husband and he loves her. They lie in bed at night and watch TV. She's the police chief. She meets an old admirer in the big city. He's Asian. She is just curious. He is desperate. She has a self-effacing, aw-sucks, I'm not too bright (but I really am) style reminiscent of Tyne Daly in TV's ""Cagey and Lacy"" from some years back. Her husband Norm is a big guy who cooks for her and is an artist who paints wildlife. One of his duck paintings becomes a postage stamp. They all say ""Yaw"" a lot.<br/><br/>The forlorn cold and desolate landscape of North Dakota is a Americana locale not used cinematically since I don't know when-Clint Eastwood's High Plains Drifter (1973), I guess. The script and direction are tidy without being too flashy. Everything is designed to surprise or bemuse the audience. Even the accents. There is the requisite quota of bright red blood; plenty of bullets puncture flesh and split bone. There's some gutter sex and a few shocking sights (one of the perps stuffs the other into a wood chip machine). All in all it's a slick, carefully crafted thriller with an artistic veneer, nicely photographed. It's clear that Coen and Coen have watched the movies of Atom Egoyan, Gus Van Sant, David Lynch, Oliver Stone, etc., and here pay them the sincere compliment of imitation with variation-or is it the other way around?"

","Typical situation. Some Hollywood insiders put out some piece of trash that thumbs its nose at anything with any sense and all of the ""smart"" people rave about it. In the vision of the producers, all of the decent people are stupid and the criminals are the interesting ones. Meanwhile, two hours are wasted with lousy dialog, poor acting and pacing that makes the ice age look like a party. Of course, it won some Oscars! How else would the intelligentsia living in the brain-addled, sunshine paradise of Southern California prove that the rest of us don't know anything. ""Oh yeah! You betcha, yeah!"" Steve Buscemi and the Cohen Bros. should not produce any other expectations. They are lousy, but have exceeded their typical capacity for producing junk with this one."

","Fargo effortlessly plays off of the dichotomy between an idiot husband's desperation and a police chief's Minnesotan charm. Highly rewatchable."
"maxtbuettner","9","3","4","7 May 2018"," My favorite Coen Brother film
","Fargo is about how far Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) will go to get some money and how out of control the situation becomes. The film follows pregnant chief police Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) as she tries to piece it all together. Frances McDormand gives a wonderful, Oscar winning performance as the multi-layered police chief. On the outside she has a comical personality, but she is also deeply caring. The movie is rounded together with fantastic performances from Steve Buscemi, Peter Stormare, and William H. Macy.
 
The movie is beautifully shot by Roger Deakins, earning him his second Oscar nomination. The greatest aspect of the film is how the Coen brother's combated the barren landscape with dark comedy. The mixture of irony, awkward moments, and laughing at inappropriate times really make this film enjoyable to watch and a great film over all."

"stk974","10","3","4","1 December 2017"," Illuminating and awakening in every sense
","This is my first review about a movie which is not in my mother language and I chose this movie specifically because although I like many Coen brothers' movies, this film will be in my heart in its special place, kind of forever.<br/><br/>This is a black comedy crime movie but even in its gory scenes, the humanitarian perspective intelligently mixed with unnerving humor has never lost on you. This movie is an excellent example of what we should know and learn further about crime world and what individual ethics mean in every way we could comprehend. In all the characters, we can observe what is right and wrong and why they choose the paths they choose and what makes a human being a good person or evil. It is kind of a moral teaching session.<br/><br/>The excellent acting and the script carry you from the first moment to the final moment of this film. The whole movie, even in its dark moments flows like a river and you forget the minutes pass. You can also see that the actors disappear in their performances and you cannot even say they are acting even though you know because they seem to you as if they were the real people and you were watching a horribly dark story in actual life from the first row alive. I especially fell in love with Frances McDormand's superb acting skills in this masterpiece, as I should call it since Coen Brothers' directing is peerless as well.<br/><br/>The plot seems quite ordinary yet it reveals itself in no time with unexpected twists and turns throughout until you start to predict the next moves and fail each and every time. It is difficult not to empathize with each and every character and ask ""what would I do if I were in their shoes?"". The answers are always undetermined as they depend on your own character, even your mood and that's the beauty and the sincerity of this art work.<br/><br/>The scenes, especially the ones with the plain snow are fascinating and resonating for sure and also those are sort of etched in one's mind.<br/><br/>Also special kudos to William Macy, as a master in acting as he will always be. I am always a huge fan of him but in Fargo, he is excellent. And of course, Buscemi is fantastic as usual.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie is a timeless classic and a never to miss. It is such a movie that you can enjoy any time you watch and as if the first time no matter how many times you have already watched it. In my opinion, every real film lover should be thankful to Coen Brothers and all of the cast and crew for making such an unforgettable treat for us and I am definitely lucky to know this film."

","To all the Fargo fans, <br/><br/>I re-watched it recently after a very long time.<br/><br/>I read Ebert and Siskel were watching the movie in a theater and Siskel turned to Ebert and said it is for films like Fargo that he watches movies.<br/><br/>Food has so much prominence in the film. Everyone's always consuming food. It made me hungry. Or they are watching TV. But it does not seem to satisfy them.<br/><br/>The film is so damn entertaining. Most scenes don't last for too long. It made me wish the director would show me some more about the characters. Especially Steve Buscemi's character. His date with the prostitute was really sad. No wonder, people got together and made a whole TV series based on this film. That's how much this film captured their imagination. I mean, every character in the film could have a separate film about their life.<br/><br/>A lot of indoor scenes would be followed by an outdoor one. Each character has some kind of notable mannerism or eccentricity. This is foregrounded. The film has two of the best character actors in William.H.Macy and Steve Buscemi. The acting is exceptional.<br/><br/>The film is a great achievement.<br/><br/>Best Regards, Pimpin.<br/><br/>(10/10)"
"andy-933-696608","8","3","4","9 November 2013"," Oh Yah!
","To describe this film as complex would be redundant in its conception, when really it is a simple story. Although engaging in its depiction, Fargo gives this idea that there is a deeper meaning in it. The opening title sequence claims that this film is based on a true story, when really it's the culmination of many stories the Coen brothers have investigated. When promoting the film, in a 1996 interview with Charlie Rose, Charlie himself made a comment regarding the nature of the title sequence, and how it demonstrates how far the Coen brothers will go. It was a joke, and although it was jolly in spirit, the Coen's own take on the title was that it was battle between choosing Brainerd or Fargo. Obviously Fargo won that bout. But overall the tone of the film in its initial portrayal, is that it is a simple film, and the motives of the characters are simple to the extent that they can create a complexity within Fargo that we as an audience strive to understand them behind their own simplicity. As with any Coen Brother's film, there is an inevitable sense of tragedy within the story, and because it is shown in such a casual and forward manner, all we can do is laugh.<br/><br/>Taking place in the winter of 1987 at Fargo North Dakota, a pair of buffoons, Carl (Buscemi), a funny looking fella who can't shut up, and Gaear (Stomare) a mute who only speaks when he's hungry, are recruited by an even bigger schmuck. Jerry Lundergard (Macy), although both polite and simple, is two faced enough that he'll orchestrate a scheme to kidnap his own wife in order to extort his father in law, played dog heartedly by Harve Presnell, just to solve some of his financial troubles. Back home in Minneapolis, Jerry works as an executive sales manager for his Father in law, and even after a deal he proposed kicks in, his wife Jean (Rudred) is kidnapped. The sequence although portrayed with some humor, also carries with it an intensity in the moments of terror and panic Rudred shows in her erratic movements of fear.<br/><br/>Not too long after the kidnapping, a shooting takes place with three people being killed at Brainerd. By that time, half hour has passed, and then are we only introduced to the protagonist, Officer Marge Gunderson (McDormand). Being seven months pregnant, and carrying a truck load, Margi as her quaint husband Norm (Lynch) calls her, begins her investigation into the Brainerd murders. Marge is both calm and polite in her interactions with others, and even to the extent that she'll simply keep saying ""Yah"" and ""Oh you betcha"" when really she's bearing some forms of hostility and disappointment.<br/><br/>Although there is some disappointment to her search for justice, there is none within the overall portrayal of the character's the Coen Brother's have sketched in this combination of true stories. Each brings forth a unique level of oddness to the story that they transcends the simplicity of the film. A lot of the exterior scenes show a blank abyss of nothingness in the snow covered roads of North Dakota and Minneapolis, as the camera focus shots merely envelop the white snow during daylight, and even more illuminating during the night scenes, ushering a darker and more depriving tone within the film's more tragic elements. The interior scenes capture a much smaller and closed sense of existence within the simplicity of the characters, and their own understanding of the circumstances they encounter in their lives. One particular close-up of Marge as she contemplates the point of the Brainerd murders, never fully conceiving of why anyone would commit such an atrocity, and for money no less. She then comments on life and on the beautiful day in front of her. The detail of her introspection into human morality gives her greater depth and complexity, as normal as she may appear to be back home with her husband Norm. She questions the motives people have, and this merely represents her innocence, and at some tragic level her own ignorance.<br/><br/>As hard as it may be to understand why bad things happen, thinking it is simple merely drenches the curiosity with ignorance and reduces it to a more dismissible manner of existential contemplation. Fargo is brilliant and captivating in its odd sense of normality, capturing a peculiar and equally entertaining depiction of ""Minnesota Nice"" and the ""Sing Song"" regional accents. Every moment a character utters a ""You betcha"", or ""Yah"", its repetitiveness does not grow to be tiring ,but merely all the more entertaining in its ironic and often cynically delicious theme of Coen Brothers comedy. Over the course of the Coen Brother's careers, from films such as Blood Simple, or Barton Fink, which exemplify much darker tones, they managed to elaborate on the type of comedy they depict in each of their films. In the previously mentioned Charlie Rose interview, they couldn't really explain the comedy they conceive, only that they simply break from the more conventional standards. It's this break that stands out enough for anyone, fan or no fan to recognize within its perplexity. Fargo, as both a comedy and a thriller captures a humorous but brutal murder story that triggers a self-awareness within its protagonist Marge Gunderson, that although she questions the purpose of a such a transgression, she immediately returns to the normalcy of her life, showing very little change from experience. Some would label that as not a poor form of character development, when really it's more of accurate representation of a common folk the Coen's grew up around in the white abyss they lived in throughout their childhood."

McDormand, Macy, and Buscemi were fantastic in their respective roles. McDormand's portrayal was very charming and I enjoyed watching her in this very much.<br/><br/>The setting of the film really added atmosphere to the film and it wouldn't be the same without it, along with the musical score.

"tjsdshpnd","8","4","6","14 September 2009"," A Cult Classic Not To Be Missed
","Good Black Comedy movies are a rarity and black comedies on supposedly real life incidents are extremely scarce. Fargo's creative team including the multi-faceted Coen brothers made it a point to illustrate in the beginning of the movie that all events are based on real life incidents with their unique 'touch' of-course. Fargo is a story about a car salesman who is in desperate need of money and thus he hires two crooks to kidnap his wife so that he can get a hefty ransom from his father-in-law (Who is a wealthy man and not much fond of his (son-in-law). Things go wrong when the crooks had to kill 3 people to hide their identity and thus a cycle is started of blood-shed which is investigated and eventually solved by a pregnant female cop who is actually the protagonist or the lead of this movie. Bollywood fans may find this story very similar to the Saif, Fardeen starrer 'Love Ke Liye Kucch Bhi Karega'. Actually Love Ke Liye is an average rip-off of Fargo.<br/><br/>The performances are noteworthy especially the female cop played by Mcdormand (Favorite actress of the Coen Bros.) Her expressions are hilarious and her accent funny. I have doubts though if she deserved an Oscar she won that year for this movie, but surely it was a good performance. The car salesman played by Macy leaves a mark on the viewers mind. Steve Buscemi as the 'funny face', loud mouth crook utilities all the screen time he has been given perfectly. Overall, a cult classic not to be missed.<br/><br/>Rating : 8/10"

","This is without a doubt the worst movie that I have ever seen. Terrible acting, slow-moving plot, and absolutely unbelievable fools for characters (no, this does not make for a better movie. Better movies allow the audience to IDENTIFY with the characters). The only thing that could have given this movie a shred of credibility and humor was if it were based on a true story. But surprise, surprise...it wasn't! The writers/producers took a few creative liberties in this story, one of which was the intro which states that it was based on a true story.<br/><br/>Whenever I speak to someone who feels that this was a great movie, their argument for it is typically, ""Well, just think about the context. This actually happened! It's based on a true story!"" Hmmm...do you believe everything you see in the movies? Maybe you'd better watch out for the Blair Witch the next time you go for a walk in the woods."
"bryan_nixon79","10","6","11","5 July 2005"," ""Fargo"" does not belong in the wood chipper, unlike the majority of films today
","Fargo is a breath of fresh air. It is inspiring for movie-goers, because the majority of films lack inspiration or originality. Joel and Ethan Coen's masterpiece is funny, sadistic, dark, violent, intense, and true. The setting is cold and harsh, which is perfect for the events that unfold in the storyline. It deserves its place in the top 100 films of all time. The acting is top-of-the-line, as well. Frances McDormand deserved her Academy Award. Due to these facts, you simply must watch this film. The thing that impresses me the most with this film, as with other films by the Coen brothers, is that it portrays what can result from a lie, which eventually explodes and ultimately leads to death and madness. Thou shalt not lie."
"jimbo-53-186511","4","8","16","6 December 2013"," Another overrated Coen brothers film
","I really don't understand what everyone loves about this film. To me, it wasn't the film itself that was the problem, but the way in which it was told that was the major problem.<br/><br/>OK, so the basic plot is Jerry Lundegaard (William H Macy) is up to his eyeballs in debt and comes up with a plan to stage the kidnapping of his wife with 2 criminals Carl Showalter (Buscemi) and Gaear Grimsrud (Peter Stormare). He arranges for them to kidnap his wife and then he intends to extort money from her wealthy father Wade Gustafson (Harve Presnell) and split the extortion money with his criminal counterparts, but things don't quite go according to plan;<br/><br/>********************SPOILERS*****************************************<br/><br/>For me, one of the biggest problems lay with the character of Jerry Lundegaard. One of the basic rules of film making is Character Development and this was the biggest failing of the film. We get pretty much zero character development from Jerry - we learn that he has money problems, but we never know why or how this has come about? As its based on a true story, we could probably find this out through Wikipedia or Google, but that's not the point. The Coen brothers should have explained this so that we could at the very least 'connect to the protagonist'.<br/><br/>Then there is the ridiculous kidnapping scene; Jean Lundegaard (Kristin Rudrud) is in the living room watching TV and sees a man with a balaclava approach her house - she sees him for a good 10 seconds but just sits there and doesn't do anything and one of the kidnappers peers through clear glass and looks all across her lounge, but fails to see her stood up in the living room (is he blind??) and then he smashes the door with a baton. I suppose her not doing anything could perhaps be put down to shock. But then it gets worse.......<br/><br/>The second kidnapper kicks the front door through (with ease) and then both men chase her up to the bathroom and the 2 men struggle to get through a standard internal wooden door (logically an internal door would be weaker than a front door) yet it took 2 of them and a crowbar to get through the bathroom door, yet one kick from 1 kidnapper sees the front door go flying to the floor....... come on!!!) Then whilst the kidnappers are 'struggling' to get through the bathroom door. I use the term 'struggling' loosely as that would not happen in the real world. Jean opens the bathroom window and hides behind the shower curtain - to make it look as though she had escaped through the bathroom window - (good idea), but just when you are about to think that an ounce of plausibility is kicking into play what happens? She jumps out from behind the shower curtain (for no reason) with the shower curtain attached to her face, falls down the stairs and gets rendered unconscious and the kidnappers take her away. WTF? Why not just stay behind the curtain and wait till they leave? With Jean's initial cunning double bluff they never would have known.<br/><br/>Anyway, swiftly moving on to good parts of Fargo and one of the plus points for me was the pregnant police officer Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand). Her and her dopey sidekick did provide some comic relief and some tension to proceedings, but if I'm honest even Gunderson's character and her relevant investigations were a little under utilised.<br/><br/>I think the main problem with this film is the way that the Coen brothers have told the story; no motivation for his character's behaviour (expect for money - surely there must have been more to it than that). The way the kidnapping scene was depicted was also preposterous as far as I was concerned.<br/><br/>In summary, this had its good moments (mainly McDormand and Buscemi), but it's let down by numerous absurdities and a lack of sympathy for Jerry Lundegaard. The Coens admit themselves that 'many of the events' were based on what actually happened rather than 'all of the events' (which helps to explain the numerous absurdities in the plot - I never did feel that this entirely rang true whilst watching it). This had the potential to be great, but the lack of a decent back story for Jerry Lundegaard meant that I could never connect to his character meaning ultimately that I couldn't connect to the film. This had the potential to be great, but ultimately it was just a waste of 100 minutes."

Ms. McDormand probably did the worst artificial Scandinavian sing-song dialect ever heard by man, woman or dead cat, except when a bad amateur mimic was mocking Norwegians, etc.  This story was really lame!  I walked out at the end (why did I stay till the end? - I don't know to this day) wondering who the movie critics were that recommended it - I would certainly not trust their opinions in the future. This movie was highly thought of in the worst movie year ever - all the candidates for the Oscar were weak, small films . . . that would never be CONSIDERED for awards in a normal year.

""Yea?"" ""Yea, kinda funny looking."" ""Anything else?"" ""No, just kinda funny looking."" This to me is not an intellectual film and the saddest part is, the detective work didn't lead to the capture. It was pure luck. I happened to be driving by and, oh there is the car we have been looking for. To top it off there is one scene where the detective meets with an old friend of hers. There is no reason for the scene and it is quite out of place. In the end the movie is barely a 2 star movie and defiantly not in any top 100-movie list I would ever make."
"AvinashPatalay","Null","5","9","8 July 2010"," The genius called ""Coen Bros""
","Heard quite a lot about ""Coen Bros"" but never really got around to watch any of their body of work. When I watched ""Fargo"" today I was spellbound by the cinematic genius('es). Considering this movie is about 15-years old it would be an understatement to say that their writing and cinematic sensibilities is beyond expression. <br/><br/>The characterisation of each actor leaves an impression. For instance unlike other movies in ""Fargo"" a cop is just not a character, he has a life too, a family and emotions. Unlike a cog-in-the-wheel the writing goes a bit deeper to flesh out the character more effectively thereby making them more true-to-life and connectable.<br/><br/>Performance wise, as stated earlier every character is a gem. <br/><br/>۩ William Hacey:: The backbone of the plot and hence he ought to have delivered good in good condition. He delivers to the utmost perfection. Perhaps the best in his career.<br/><br/>۩ Steve Buscemi:: A hidden gem then as opposed to now. And his spark showed way back then. A very natural and gifted actor.<br/><br/>۩ Frances McDormand:: She literally gets into the skin of the Marge.<br/><br/>۩ Harve Presnell:: very regal and assertive performance.<br/><br/>The dark humour is plenty and slightly shocking, which is kind of expected. The background music is paced well with the narrative and does linger in the head for a while. <br/><br/>Watch it once and you can be absolutely certain to come back and relish the characters all over again."

","Without question, the worst movie I've ever seen.  It isn't an issue of style - I like Tarantino movies, for example - but one of quality.  The plot was unimaginative, the characters insipid (which I hate to say, because I like William H. Macy, Steve Buscemi otherwise)  and the writing weak at best.  There was no flow to the story, if it could be called that.  The film was so bad, in fact, that we almost shut it off in the middle and took it back to the video store early - and I sat through all of 'Jacob's Ladder'.<br/><br/>An associate of mine suggested the appeal was the constant juxtaposition of the absurd and the banal, but that's how it felt - like the writers sat there and said, 'if we juxtapose the absurd and banal, it'll be a great movie.'  Completely forced and artificial.<br/><br/>Their idea of what midwesterners sound like was pulled from thin air. Having lived in the midwest all my life, I can honestly say I've never heard anyone speak like that before.

","When I first saw this movie, it had been advertised as a ""black comedy."" As a result, numerous people in the audience giggled and laughed at various scenes, some of which, were not intended to be funny at all. I enjoyed the film alright, largely due to the wonderful performances of Steve Buscemi and Kenneth Macy. I have to admit, that I did snicker at some scenes. HOWEVER, after recently viewing this film, I have done a complete 180. This is an ugly film and very mean spirited. Oh yeah, I know that the Coens issue a disclaimer about how they were not changing the story, out of respect to the dead, BULL! Excuse me if I am wrong, but the real events having to do with this case involved numerous people being killed? So, why so much emphasis on making fun of the way people in Minnesota talk? In the story, a boy is told his mother has been kidnapped by unknown assailants. So why does the scene close with a close up shot of the ""Accordion King"" poster, which is completely ridiculous? Did the Coens actually see that poster in the boy's house? Or did they just want to keep cracking little jokes? While the police chief is supposed to be investigating the killings, she goes off to have this lunch with a comedic Asian character. Funny scene? You bet. But you know what, that whole scene was completely made up, did not happen. So why, are we getting more comedy thrown into this story? Did the Coens not say that the events in this movie were all true? And this is what bothers me. None of the humor in this film actually involves the specifics of this case. The humor is all added to mock a very real and tragic series of events. Hey, if you want to produce fiction, fine. But don't claim your story is non-fiction and then tack on fictitious comedic scenes. Great performances or not, this is an ugly and insensitive film."

","I typically comment on films only when my view varies from the vast majority of commenters. I don't see how this film makes the top 250 list. Yes, there are quality performances delivered by Buscemi, Macy, and McDormand, but nowhere near Oscar material - and I think they would agree. McDormand does the Northern laid back officer role very well, and of course, Macy is at home as the stressed out protagonist.<br/><br/>I agree with critics that wonder about the purpose of the film. What was the purpose of the multiple idiotic sex scenes with the villains and the local whores? The free-wheeling cussing was enough to guarantee the R rating. <br/><br/>Life in the North during the dead of winter IS very bleak for the uninitiated, but the plot is worthy of only TV movie of the week attention. Grinding frozen human remains in a wood chipper?? PLEASE. In my opinion Buscemi steals the show, and carries the audience through all of the insanity of the situation confronting all the characters. Don't tell me that the freakish situation that McDormand encountered - multiple homicides on the highway in the middle of winter - wouldn't have stressed her out just a little bit more, yet she treated the whole situation as some routine investigation.

","I must say that I cannot for the life of me figure out why people think that the movies made by the Coen brothers are so great. I have seen numerous comments that another of their films is ""the best movie ever,"" and that movie, which I will not name, is even worse than this incredibly mediocre movie! I think that the Coen brothers put out in-your-face, insipid garbage. I have no problems with silly movies, in fact I like to suspend my disbelief for any movie that is done in any kind of clever way, but their movies really demonstrate how movies can fail to challenge the viewer even to suspend disbelief! Well, my disbelief is the praise their movies get.<br/><br/>""Fargo"" is about a kidnapping scheme that is badly bungled from beginning to end, but the real bungling is again the total artlessness of the way the story is put together and acted out. And as I wrote above, the biggest ""entertainment"" are scenes of murder and violence that are totally in-your-face. The day is saved by a pregnant police officer, who is so sweet and kind, we just know that she will get her man. Yet neither her portrayal nor any of the other portrayals of people from the Great Lake states are very effective. It's not that they aren't accurate, because they are, and this adds to the boredom of the movie - they almost never express emotion, they never get out of their ordinariness, neither when people are brutally murdered nor when one of the officer's former male friends has personal problems. No, life goes on for these people regardless, and what is entertaining about that banal sameness? Finally, the portrayals in the movie are just too cute, at least for me.<br/><br/>What makes a lot of movies work is that their characters have transformations, they learn something from their experiences, they go from bad to good or vice-versa, or undergo some kind of change. And that is yet another reason why this movie fails in my opinion, after all the murders and other actions, no one learns anything at all! The man who arranged the kidnapping learns nothing, the murderers learn nothing, and life just goes on as it was!"
"Ross-26","1","13","35","21 February 1999"," pointless and offensive
","FARGO is its own worst critic.  Supposedly based upon true events, the plot is glacial and pointlessly violent and the characters are either half-realized or irrelevantly annoying (what do the fantastically exaggerated accents of several characters have to do with anything?) or both, which one presumes is intended to reflect the film-makers' vision of reality.  Fine.  But it's one thing to point out such a vision of reality in a film (successfully accomplished in, say, BADLANDS); it's another for a film to actually BE this vision of reality.  FARGO is a dog-and-pony show, a trick film, intended to make a meta-fictional point by exploiting the film-viewer's pre-supposed moral vacuousness and lurid fascination with sex and violence.  In short, it is not a film of substance and the point is that, truly in the sense which the Coen brothers mean it, only insubstantial, ""half-realized characters"" could be fans of it (naturally, to realize this point is to be ""realized"" and no longer be a fan).  Looked at this way, FARGO is brilliant, but still only in the most menial, kick-'em-when-they're-down sense of the word."
"Leofwine_draca","10","3","5","11 July 2016"," My favourite Coen brothers movie
","The Coen brothers can always be guaranteed to deliver a quirky, diverting, off-key movie experience, and FARGO remains their most successful movie to date; a story of small-town life, dead cold temperatures, and a bloody crime wave. As with the majority – if not all – of their films, it's a densely-plotted, intelligently-scripted story, with a cold grasp on reality throughout but nevertheless some absurd situations to enjoy.<br/><br/>Things begin small and gradually build up to a blood-spattered climax, propelled by tons of originality and irregularity which propels this past most similar genre fare. Frances McDormand deservedly got an Oscar for her excellent performance as the pregnant cop, but William H. Macy is equally good as the nervous car salesman whose life spirals out of control. Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare are also brilliant as the two psychotic criminals who begin by kidnapping and end in  well I'll leave it for you to find out. In parts touching, warm, funny, frightening and shocking, FARGO is an example of the crime thriller at its best."

They made Barton Fink that film about the mind instead, in a most obvious way by that point, rooms mapping to mind, wallpaper coming unglued.<br/><br/>So by the time the Coens made this, there was already a clear blueprint of inclinations. Once more a film noir about a schmuck whose desire makes the skies cave in on him. Once more about the life of the mind, the mind dictating egoistic desire and greed, less obvious than Barton. Along the way we get quirky staples, dry gaffe, guns, blood, a satchel of money, to offset the frigid pace in the broad audience's mind.<br/><br/>But although Macy's desire makes all sorts of accident and chaotic whimsy bubble up in the world, a softly maintained order straight from Frances' calm Minnesotan mind prevails. The film offers in fact a perfectly centered metaphor of the Coens at work and their larger blueprint. It's a cold world out there, with broken people and human ego and desire creating inane anxieties, but it hasn't numbed the heroine's soul who calmly goes through a narrative, piecing it together, to save a mirrored wife from danger and restore order in the world of the film.<br/><br/>It's fine work to see on your first rounds.

It takes a parting of this logic to give me the great stuff that go beyond ideas; Lynch's whole career has been a creative journey of this. I miss this here. Still, the entry points are there to see and imagine from. The kidnapping plot as a thought that wafts from his mind before he could keep hold of it, herself woken up in the middle of the night by nightmare.<br/><br/>The Coens must have been aware of this fettering.

"Ricky_Roma__","Null","3","5","17 September 2005"," Super film with a super lady (spoilers)
","It's well known now that Fargo, contrary to the titles at the start, isn't based on a true story. It was just a little dig, a little joke at the expense of the 'true story' phenomenon. But at the same time it was a calculated move to get the audience to go with the story, because if the audience is told that something is true they're more likely to allow themselves to be swept up by it and believe in it. And I guess for some people Fargo may seem a little weird (well, to people who have been weaned on blockbusters). Therefore the true story tag was there to help make the plot seem more plausible.<br/><br/>But, really, the film didn't need it. The film only seems odd in that the characters speak like real people, with all the broken sentences and 'ums' and 'ahs' (and 'yahs'), and act like real people  some act with nobility, others are completely feckless and some are violent. It also seems unusual because we're used to films where people speak perfectly, think perfectly and act perfectly. So, therefore, most audiences are used to a Hollywood unreality, which is why Fargo was such a breath of fresh air all those years back <br/><br/>What I enjoy most about Fargo is Jerry Lundegaard (played by William H. Macy). He's such an idiot, a real putz ('What the heck d'ya mean?'). Yet despite the fact that he's stupid, and despite the fact that he has his own wife kidnapped for money, I can't help but kind of feel sorry for the guy. And I sort of feel sorry for him because he's human. He's embarrassed when he's asked why he needs the money; he's awkward when he's telling his son that something has happened to his mother; he gets angry when his plans fall through; and he loses his rag when the police finally catch on to him. Yet even then he desperately tries to maintain his dignity. He never reveals his true feelings. ('I answered the darn I'm co-operating here.') And I also like the fact that he always tries to overcome the new problems that he faces. He never quits. The funniest example is the way that he drives off halfway through a police interview. It kind of reminds me of The Simpsons (the sound of rushing footsteps and then the screeching of tyres). But there's also his final scene where he tries to escape the police by climbing through a window. He's a pathetic guy but at least he seems real.<br/><br/>But although Lundegaard is something of a sympathetic character, he's also the most unforgivable. I mean, Steve Buscemi's character and Peter Stormare's character are just plain ruthless. They're greedy, immoral people and that's that. But Lundergaard is a family man with responsibilities and people who are dependant on him. Therefore, although he doesn't kill anyone, his actions are the most heinous.<br/><br/>But speaking of Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare, they're absolutely fantastic in this film. At first they kind of seem like a buffoonish odd couple, but because you've bought into their weird relationship with its amusing eccentricities (I love the pancake conversation), it makes the violence all the more shocking. These aren't cackling villains or loud-mouthed bad guys; they're the sort of psychopathic people you could meet in a bar or on the street. And as a consequence they're more interesting to watch. I especially like the scene where Buscemi is trying to get Stormare to talk. Even kidnappers need conversation. But I also like the scene with the state trooper. It's the scene where the fun and games stop. You really know what these characters are capable of. And the coldly efficient killings that follow are brutal in how simply they're directed. Too often directors try and tell you how to feel. The Coens just show it, and it's a technique that, for me, is far more effective.<br/><br/>Another thing that the Coens show are the Minnesota people. Having never been there I have no idea whether the accent is accurate, but it's an interesting portrait of a society. Everyone is so damn polite. Even when a parking attendant is getting threatened he's still got a big smile on his face. And there's one guy who, matter of factly, tells how Buscemi's character threatened him. It's a great scene because it captures the way that people tell stories  kind of flatly and with little creativity. And at the end they talk about the weather. Brilliant. But setting the story in Minnesota was a great decision because polite societies are often the most violent  just take Victorian England. Everything gets repressed and it ends up bursting. Plus the snow and the pure white landscape hint at something dark under the surface.<br/><br/>However, what lingers most in the memory is the character of Marge. She's the film's moral centre. She's the one who sees through the insanity of what's happening and the one that gives you hope for the future. Indeed, Marge and Norm are comforting figures. They have a relationship that is without mystery but one that is rock solid. They give you hope that sanity will prevail. And I like Marge's scene with the frighteningly needy Mike. ('You're such a super lady and I'm so lonely.') Even in the face of such pent-up madness she keeps her dignity and her composure. She really is a super lady.<br/><br/>And Fargo is a super film. I'm not sure I'd put it on a par with The Big Lebowski and it's a bit too thin to be truly great, but it's certainly an excellent piece of cinema.<br/><br/>Oh, but I've also got to mention one of my favourite lines in film. When Buscemi is talking to an escort he says, 'Find that work interesting, do you?' The woman's reaction is priceless."
"FilmOtaku","10","3","5","7 September 2004"," The Coen Brothers' masterpiece
","How do I even begin to review a film that has been in my personal Top Three of all time since the second I left the theater back in 1996? I guess that has always been one reason that I've avoided watching this film in the past year and a half that I have been reviewing every film that I see. The best thing to do, as I did with my other two favorites in my personal cinematic trinity, is describe why this movie is, in my opinion, incredible.<br/><br/>'Fargo' is, like many Coen brothers films, the story of a stupid crime gone horribly wrong. In this case, Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) is in deep debt after committing some major fraud at his father-in-law's car dealership, so he comes up with a scheme to have his wife kidnapped in order for his wealthy father-in-law to pay the ransom. Unfortunately, the men he hires (Peter Stormare and Steve Buscemi) are not only completely unstable, scary and share a half a brain among them, and what was supposed to be a simple kidnapping culminates in the murder of three innocent bystanders. Enter Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) a small-town sheriff, who also happens to be seven months pregnant, who steps in to try to solve the case.<br/><br/>'Fargo' has so many things going for it: Phenomenal acting (McDormand won a well-deserved Oscar for her role) by all players, supporting and lead and a brilliant script that is part mystery, part thriller and part drama, and all layered in a thin veneer of some of the darkest comedy seen in recent years, are just two of the outstanding elements. The cinematography of 'Fargo' however is absolutely beautiful. The snow-white landscape is so stark and vast; yet suddenly you realize that you are watching a tiny figure in the distance, trudging through the snow; and it's one of the main characters. One shot in particular is so unbelievably framed, that for a good ten seconds, the viewer isn't entirely sure what they are looking at, until it becomes obvious that it is a deserted parking lot with one car parked in the middle of it. Scenes like these are literally breath-taking, and harkens back to some of the beautiful cinematography in one of their earlier films, 'Millers Crossing'. <br/><br/>One of the funniest things I remember about this film was actually an unfavorable review my parents, who are both movie lovers themselves, gave it before I saw it for myself. It was, verbatim, 'We saw 'Fargo' and it was REALLY dark. We hated it. You will LOVE it.' And indeed I did. I walked out of the theater eight years ago on a cold, snowy night and literally thought to myself, 'THAT is how films should be made.'<br/><br/>That really sums it all up in simple, non-flashy terms. And because of my very true adoration for their work, I have described how choosing my favorite Coen Brothers film is like a mother choosing her favorite child. It takes a film that is a step above 'phenomenal' in order for it to shine above all of the other fantastic films they have made. In my opinion, 'Fargo' is and always will be that caliber of film for me. Every other film of theirs have varying degrees of 'great-ness', because I truly love and admire all of their work, but because of its standout performances, intelligent and compelling script, and it's beautiful presentation, 'Fargo' is a four star film, and will always remain on my personal 'favorites' list.<br/><br/>--Shelly"

There are a lot of things that I can't understand about this movie.Why are so many characters when there are some of them that have no influence on the plot.Why characters do things with no importance, just to have them done?

Is this how we are supposed to believe the people of fargo are, ""Oh yes Mrs Police officer let be be so kind to you"" And the cop, no I don't know the names I could watch this piece of drivel, was so kind and plot to everyone.

"auto2113","6","4","8","5 May 2002"," Mr. Macy, I salute you...
","William H.Macy is my fave actor at the moment. He has been in a long list alongside such names like John Cusack, Kevin Spacey, and Matt Damon. To me, Macy makes this film a whole lot better than it should be. To me, it's a very basic plot with an overall average acting performance bar the unbeatable Mr. Macy. Frances McDormand got an oscar for her performance. I couldn't believe this after watching the film because to me she comes across as a very dim-witted talentless actress. Of course, a lot of people would say that was what her character's personality was like, but to me, I see her as not a dimwitted character, but as a poor actress who is failing to make a connection with me. I despised her in this film.<br/><br/>Macy on the other hand, played his character with such excellence, that this film was the reason why I love the guy as much as I do now. His character is perfect, he says the silly lines perfectly, and when he's in a pickle, I love the way he makes it seem like nothing's happening... the scene in the motel bathroom as an example.<br/><br/>The storyline as I previously mentioned is very basic. A car salesman needs money, so he hires two guys to hold his wife hostage, and then claim a huge ransom off her wealthy father. Things go wrong though due to the mistakes of the two criminals, and then it's a case of the hot-shot police officer to find the criminals who've left a bloody trail in their wake. It doesn't sound gripping stuff, tho neither The Usual Suspects on its back cover and we all know about that don't we?<br/><br/>So Fargo... it is good, don't get me wrong. Some of the acting performances are top notch but don't expect a twisting crime thriller... it's more comedy than serious!<br/><br/>PROS: + Macy + The conversations within are pretty funny. + Steve Buscemi plays a good crook.<br/><br/>CONS:<br/><br/><ul><li>Frances McDormand does my head in!

"Jacques98","1","9","24","13 January 2009"," Manipulative to the audiencebut not how you think.
","It's hard to deny that the vast majority of cinemaAmerican or otherwiseis going to be ridiculously overrated by a certain group of people. When that group is the actual American population itself, a lot of negative reviews like to label the said film as ""The most overrated movie of all time!"" The fact is, no matter if you or I like a film or not, almost everything gets more recognition than it deserves in America. Average movies are stretched out into ""modern masterpieces"" simply because of the utter lack of creativity or originality in cinema overall. It's much easier to force yourself to feel contentment in something you just wasted your time and money on than admit it was terrible. It's a common misconception to ""look for the good in every film"", rather than actually admit that you've seen/heard everything the film showed so many times you almost feel asleep or lost interest and made out with your girlfriend for 3/4ths of the movie, then call it a great film just because the critics did. Everything I just mentioned above could be the reason Fargo is so overrated. But if you want me to be honest, Fargo is so downright pathetic, no matter how hard I try, I can't figure out why it's overrated. At all. I just don't understand it.<br/><br/>I've seen reviews calling Fargo everything from the best movie of all time to a Shakespearian masterpiece. I read their reasoning, and I found it flat. I've watched big-name critics rave about Fargo, but even they failed to give a real reason it was so amazing. Basically, they all come down to: ""Fargo was average, sure, but the humor gave it some life."" And if that's the best they can think of, by their own logic, SpongeBob should be rated alongside The Godfather.<br/><br/>Based on a true story or not, there is nothing even remotely worth watching in Fargo. It has the same exact plot as you've seen on bad TV crime drams before, and it unfolds in exactly the same way. What's the point of making a movie about a true story if it's exactly like the countless fictional stories just like it? Fargo has no originality, and next to no creativity. Sure a few lines of dialogue are decent, but who really cares? Reviewing an entire movie based on a few lines is ludicrous. The dialogue and humor both aren't even that great. If anything, it reminds me of a severely watered-down Pulp Fiction wannabe.<br/><br/>Likewise, the heavy use of nostalgia is the sole reason this isn't playing on the women's channel instead of being called one of the best movies ever made. The Coen brothers rely heavily on nostalgia and soft-spoken characters to give off the faux sense of seeing something you haven't seen before. I always hear people calling a movie ""manipulative"" or ""and insult to my intelligence"" due to a plot twist or something that they didn't see coming. Though I usually find those types of people unintentionally hilarious, I'm going to go as far here as to say that Fargo is manipulative to the audience: it uses nostalgia to mask that it's really a dull, hollow shell. The plot is completely throw-away. A guy pays to have his wife kidnappedand weren't we all oh-so-shocked when that went wrong? For once, I'd like to see a movie where something like this goes RIGHT and everything thereafter plays out exactly as planned. That might be interesting. Fargo, however, takes the boring, safe route and does exactly as expected of it. By the closing credits, I literally asked myself out loud: ""What was the point?"" <br/><br/>I think I figured out the point. The point the Coen brothers were trying to make was that you could make the most typical movie ever, add a couple funny lines, and they'll be basking in wealth because of it. They probably even had a good laugh at the level of positivity regarding their pathetic film. Because, really, no one tries to find the faults in films anymore, just the good in everything. May I suggest that this is why we're watching Fargo and not a truly original, captivating film from these two skilled directors? If you love their crap, they're not going to waste the effort making gold.<br/><br/>1/10"

","Fargo begins with a white canvas, and as the initial credits start to appear, the icy North Dakota landscape arises, with the strange flight of a bird through the snow. There is a warning that the story tells a real fact that happened in Minnesota in 1987, but that the real names were changed in ""respect to the dead.""<br/><br/>The locations took place made in the two neighboring states and in the cities where the tragedy occurred. It looks like a home-made movie, as the directors, the Cohen brothers, Ethan, and director Joel grew up in Minneapolis.<br/><br/>Every expectation falls apart as the story progresses, to the point of not knowing for sure whether we are witnessing a tragedy, as promised, or a satire, comedy, thriller, or thriller. It's a unique, unrivaled movie where transitions occur smoothly, and even violence seems ""natural.""<br/><br/>The story revolves around a failed car salesman, Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy), who desperately needs money for a deal that can save him from bankruptcy and also the domination of his wealthy father-in-law (Harve Presnell), who, by chance, owns the car agency where Jerry works.<br/><br/>To make his investment viable, Jerry hires two scumbag lowlifes called Showalter and Grimsrud (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wife Jean (Kristin Rudrud) and share the $ 80,000 ransom paid by father-in-law Wade. Simple like that simple. Said no one ever, because everything goes wrong and all expectations turn into nightmares in the most amazing ways possible.<br/><br/>In the middle of the movie, some corpses begin to appear, frozen. Called to investigate possible murders, Brainerd's border town police chief Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) also has an unexpected profile: pregnant, she needs to have her vehicle pushed to get the engine started, and before going to the police station, goes to the market to buy worms for her husband Norm (John Carrol Lynch) to fish."

"audrablum","9","2","3","10 February 2019"," Interesting Coen brothers' film. Based on a true story. Well worth the watch.
","This week I watched the crime-drama-thriller Fargo (1996). The logline reads ""Jerry Lundegaard's inept crime falls apart due to his and his henchmen's bungling and the persistent police work of the quite pregnant Marge Gunderson."" Having spent most of my life in the west or the south, this film's Minnesotan culture was quite the experience. It was engaging to see the warmth and hospitable nature of people who live in such a frigid environment. I couldn't get past how this film was based on a true story. The chain of events was just insane and things spiraled out of control quickly. The one thing I wish has been done differently in this film is the end. Usually with ""based on true event"" films, there is some sort of message letting the audience know exactly what happened to the characters in the film, but for whatever reason, we didn't get this closure. However, I will note that the writing in these sorts of films always amazes me. The research process must take months or years and yet we get to see the story formed with so many details. Being a Coen brothers' film it is definitely a worthwhile film. I think that the thing that stood out the most for me in this movie was the cinematography. Roger Deakins really did a good job incorporating classic cinematic styles into the modern day ambience in the scenes. One shot that stood out in particular is when the two baddy's were pulled over by a police officer and Carl's (referred to as the 'funny-looking guy') eyes are highlighted. It is easy to watch this scene and dismiss the light as a natural gobo effect, however, this is a classic cinematic style highlighting the dramatic effect of realization more commonly drawn from the noir style of film. These details are what separates the amatures from the seasoned professionals. The acting was also really well done in this film, but Frances McDormand steals the show as Marge Gunderson. I was surprised at how interesting this film was and how little I knew about it before today. I would definitely recommend it and will likely be watching it again."

"akash_sebastian","8","2","3","19 May 2016"," A quirky crime-comedy which has much more to offer than what meets the eye.
","The ordinariness of the characters in this film are so carefully crafted, and if the scenes are carefully analysed in the light of all the information, the characters are really not simple and black/white as they seem. The Coen Brothers, being brought up in Minnesota, critique the Minnesota Nice nature - people with their plain and warm exterior with folksy speaking style, but not so empathetic or well-wishing from within; the characters are as cold and distant as the letters of the film title because the characters are as emotionally isolated as story's vast empty landscape. The accent and snow, the white and distant environment, all these things accentuate the feel of the living conditions and community of northern US. I can't testify to the accuracy of the time and place, but the Coens surely give us an intriguing character study.<br/><br/>The film takes quite a few witty jabs at capitalism and consumerism; it explores people's (here, especially Americans') obsession with fast food, television and cars. The realistic dialogues and quirkiness do make the characters stand out, like all Coen Brothers films. Many might say Marge Gunderson is the only character with good morals, but she isn't as pure as she seems. Marge, though an interesting character who defies prescribed gender roles and becomes our lead protagonist (though she enters only after one-third the film), she is as emotionally distant as the rest, as evidenced from her murder-scene inspection and ending ride with one of the kidnappers. Her routine life and by-the-book procedure, combined with her husband's not-so- sophisticated paintings about ducks and the decor of their house, exemplify the fact how they are a regular couple in a consumerist web so blissfully content in their simplicity and mediocrity.<br/><br/>Expectation vs what's given to us. From the opening title where it says that this is based on a true story and events are shown as it occurred, a certain expectation is set. The Coens take advantage of this liberty and tell the story in the most unusual but interesting way. But they subvert these expectations by slowly inserting scenes that people couldn't have known (if the events are being shown as they occurred). But this helps us understand the characters much better. (We now know that almost the entire thing is fictional, other than, maybe, the murder that inspired them.) The Coens do this throughout the film. Two other good examples come from the scene where Marge meets her Asian friend from college. Compared to the ways Asians are traditionally portrayed in films, Mike really stood out - not at all a clichéd, accented Asian guy, but an emotionally unstable lonely guy who still stays with his parents in his 30s. And the story he tells Marge about his life, we immediately lap it all up, just like Marge does, not realising that the story had the exact plot details from 'Love Story'. The Coens surely take other such jabs at American pop culture. It's not what you expect from a true-story-based crime thriller. It's not what you expect from a comedy. Coen Brother films never usually fit into a single genre, and the unusual blend of crime and humour makes the film stand out.<br/><br/>And without Roger Deakins, the film wouldn't look the way it does. That parking lot scene has been praised and analysed to death by now. And yes, it's a spectacular shot and has so much to say. The acting from everyone in the cast is terrific, especially Steve Buscemi, Frances McDormand and William H. Macy. Macy gives us such a unique and memorably loathsome character - an apathetic, selfish and cowardly hypocrite, always maintaining such a cheery facade. But he represents the frustrations felt by the pawns in the capitalist system, rarely able to earn or save much to be financially or emotionally satisfied. Hence, his various schemes to collect enough money, run away and start a new comfortable life.<br/><br/>Though just a little less than 100 minutes, the film has been assembled with such attention to detail and innovation that it can be analysed and understood in so many different ways. It's not something that seems so great in the first view itself, but the more you see it or think about it, the more it lingers in your mind. Clever to end the film with the words ""Two more months"", since we know it might be a reference to the end of winter when the snow might melt and reveal the suitcase to a passerby."

","Fargo is a 1996 black comedy/crime drama film directed by Ethan and Joel Coen (The Coen Brothers) and stars William H. Macy, Frances McDormand and Steve Buscemi. Often seen as the film that launched the Coen Brothers successful career, Fargo without a doubt deserves all the credit it receives. The story focuses around a spineless, nervous car salesman who arranges for his wife to be kidnapped and held for a ransom of $80,000 to extort from his wealthy father-in-law and boss, in his desperation for money to repay an outstanding loan. Which ends up going horrifically wrong resulting in a series of grizzly murders. Fargo fantastically blends its sharp wit of dry humour and black comedy with its gruesome, thrilling and intriguing narrative, the two seem to go hand-in-hand perfectly with Fargo having scenes that will have you bursting out laughing and others on the edge of your seat. Fargo also features beautiful cinematography with wide, expansive shots of snow covered landscapes as well as a fitting dark and unsettling soundtrack. Each actor/actress completely owns their character making their motivations and actions clear, as well as relatable. Fargo has but a few nit-picking flaws, such as a particular scene which seems unnecessary to the advancement of the plot and feels out of place, in which Frances McDormand's character meets an old friend. Another is a plot-line which focused around Peter Stormare's character Gaear Grimsrud- not enough of the story was focused around his role as it should or could have been, also another flaw being the slight overuse of the word 'ya'. Overall, Fargo is a phenomenal film, both winning 2 well deserved Oscar's and launching the Coen Brothers career onto a new level, proving they are two of the greatest filmmakers of the modern film era. Not forgetting notifying the world of the traditional (and comedic) Minnesotan accent. Fargo is hilarious, violent, tense and intriguing. 9/10"

","So, why is the movie called ""Fargo""? Maybe it's because that's where chaos starts. For the next 98 minutes, we watch a hapless, smiley, terminally nervous Minneapolis car salesman, Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy), try to settle some debts by engineering the kidnapping of his docile wife and wangling a ransom from his millionaire father-in-law. This scheme blows up in his face after he hires the wrong thugs in Fargo: Steve Buscemi as motormouth Carl Showalter and Peter Stormare as taciturn Gaear Grimsrud. The error soon results in a triple murder, with more deaths to come. And we also watch local super-sleuth Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand), the very pregnant police chief of the Minnesota town of Brainerd, as she relentlessly tracks them down.<br/><br/>The characters in Fargo are what keep the film going. Steve Buscemi plays Carl to perfection, talking too much and described as ""funny looking"". His colleague, Gaear is that shady silent type who likes to do things his own way and Peter Stormare delivers his threatening stares in a chilling way. For me, these two were the highlight of the film but William H. Macy pulls of Jerry brilliantly, displaying simultaneously a liar, a thief, a loving father and husband as well as ultimately a good guy whose life has taken a turn for the worse. Frances McDormand comically plays the traditional Minnesota local - good hearted and innocent and is a joy to watch. Fargo is deep, chilling and clever as well as very witty in places and is definitely worth seeing.<br/><br/>Overall rating: 9 out of 10."

","Fargo is a modern classic film that I implore many film fans to see.<br/><br/>Fargo is one of the best written stories ever to be put on film. The story maintains a certain style throughout and this style is effective. The dialogue is plain, mundane, real, but maintains a certain ridiculousness. Of course, this is a trait that the Coen Brothers are known for. But in Fargo, it is shown in full form. The contrast between the characters accents, mannerisms, sensibilities, and their current situations is hilarious. This is how one does dark comedy. Take a story that still works if put in Los Angeles or New York and place it somewhere a bit outlandish yet relatable.<br/><br/>Most of the other technical aspects are solid. Most aren't too impressive, but are obviously a step above most films. The score is great as well, keeps the audience tense and is fitting to the story. Of course one can't talk about this film without mentioning the acting. Everyone plays the part well, even down to Scotty Lundegaard. Especially Frances McDormand, who had an absolutely phenomenal performance. She's strong, funny, and brings a lot of life to the film. But like I've stated before, the writing and style is what makes this movie classic. It will forever be one of my personal favorite films, and hopefully it will for you too."
"powermandan","10","2","3","18 October 2014"," Probably The Best Dark Comedy Ever Made.
","Aside from Tarantino movies, which happen to have comedic elements, this is the best dark comedy I've seen and the highest rated one on many sites. At first, I didn't see what was so great about this like the way Roger Ebert raved about it. The whole movie is funny from the overly- polite midwestern accents. Reminded me of Canadian accents. But I did not find it to be a masterpiece. Then I tried really watching it, and I never looked back.<br/><br/>The film is about a used car salesman named Jerry Lundengaard (Macy) who rigs his wife being kidnapped by two criminals be doesn't know (Buscemi, Stormare) as ransom so he can get needed money from his father-in-law (Presnell) he knows he would not get any other way. The kidnapping leads to three homicides where pregnant cop, Marge (McDormand) does some investigation and is soon hot on all their trails.<br/><br/>In the first 20 minutes or so, we meet Jerry then witness the kidnapping and the murders. This start has always been exciting. Then we meet Marge and the story really starts to unfold as she does some detective work and Jerry gets what's coming to him. For some reason, the movie lost my interest when we meet Marge. After we meet her I became more interested with just hearing the people say ""yeah!"" and ""you betcha!"" After not watching the movie for a while, I tried really watching it and I finally understood what all the commotion was all about. The story is the one of the most original you'll ever see. Originality is what makes movies great and this has it. What makes the story and events original are the characters. All characters, even bad, are lovable and well-developed, the whole movie is exciting with character-driven twists that add sheer excitement, great morals and some nice filming techniques, all while keeping funny accents with humour so dark that it messes with you. There's nothing not to like. Jerry is probably the antagonist and villain since he was the brains behind ransom and started the chain of events. He is developed so well and there is so much sympathy created for him that the viewer feels sorry for him anytime he is brought down or is seen through. He never gives up and is greatly determined. Marge, the protagonist and hero, is the most original female hero ever. She is as awesome as The Bride in the Kill Bill movies. Nobody wants to see Marge nab Jerry. Steve Buscemi is like a creature that eats away at his boss's enemy. Stormare is kick-ass psycho that plays by his own rules and answers to nobody. Both of them are funny together because they are totally different: a chatterbox and a mute. These, as well as the other characters, are so real and well-developed that they drive the movie. A pure, original character driven story and important morals that arise are Shakespeare-like. Add great filming, odd humour and thrills, you get one of America's best films ever.<br/><br/>4/4"

","This is arguably the first film that really put the Coen brothers on the map and for good reason. Everything about Fargo is unique and original, from the beautiful setting to the incredible dialogue mixing together humour, drama and beauty so seamlessly the film is nothing short of a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Fargo's story revolves around how several characters lives begin to collide with one another after a simple kidnapping scheme begins to go wrong and body counts begin to rise. But where the film really succeeds is because of the interesting range of characters ranging from McDormand's kind speaking Marge to Buscemi's rude and talkative Carl. All the leads of the film have original and interesting personalities that make them so interesting to watch. <br/><br/>Part of the brilliance of this and every Coens Brothers film is that even the small characters feel very well developed. Someone like Norm (McDormand's husband) probably has somewhere around 5 minutes screen time, but in that short time it gives him a unique personality and demonstrates the close bond between him and Marge. <br/><br/>It feels that everyone in the film matters or has some role to play, with every character having some impact on the chain of events. A single conversation can change a character's entire outlook of a situation which the Coens make believable through the great writing where we can see why they would be changed by the confrontation. <br/><br/>On top of this the film has many moments of both natural and memorable dialogue. Some of it even packs great meaning such as ""There's more to life than a little money, you know. Don'tcha know that? And here ya are, and it's a beautiful day."" Lines like this demonstrate the Coen brothers skill in creating great meaning in their work whilst maintaining realism within the dialogue. <br/><br/>Beyond this the film contains many beautiful and meaningful shots mixing a feeling of suspense into the endless roads and blank landscapes that fill the screen. Even the simplest shots of a car driving down the road feel all the more impressive as we see the sight of the headlights shine through the falling slow.<br/><br/>The Coens constantly do what all filmmakers should, which is to take risks and try different things. Everything from the setting to the characters personalities is unique within the film. From start to end Fargo is a joy to watch and a true cinematic classic."
"sjmdd","10","2","3","23 August 2009"," Should be heralded as one of the all time great movies
","You know when a movie is an absolute masterpiece, or a complete stinker, they are the easiest to review, hands down. Its the films that sit right in the middle that are hardest. Anyhow, without a shadow of a doubt Fargo falls into the former category. It was good the first time i saw it; now I've viewed it a second time it truly is a masterpiece of gargantuan proportions. There's so much right with this movie... in fact I'm unable to think of anything negative about it at all. The story, first and foremost, is a simple one. Jerry Lundegaard hires two crooks to kidnap his wife, whose father in law will pay the ransom, which Jerry will benefit from. But, like most Coen Brothers movies, nothing goes to plan. The Fact that the story is such a simple one is the first main reason why it works so well - don't necessarily over complicate the plot. Ethan and Joel know this, and in simplifying events, allow us to concentrate on the stunning script, the amazing performances and the frozen Minnesotan country. So events go awry... and we are introduced to police chief Marge Gunderson,Frances Mcdormand,AKA Mrs Joel Coen(who deservedly bagged an Oscar), one of the most endearing cinematic creations in recent memory. In a believable, simple way, heavily pregnant Marge puts together the pieces of a terrible crime gone oh so wrong. Its not that its so believable, nor the comic interpretation of the Scandinavian roots of Minessota, nor even the brilliant performances by Mcdormand, William H Macy (a career best), Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare interwoven with a biting, dark, often hilarious script,not even a marvellous score, no its the way in which, at the end, you manage to feel the way in which good prevails over evil a quite riveting and fascinating affair - even with a body count of 7 people, it never feels overly violent. Humanity wins hands down, and that, coupled with all of the above, means that it is in my book, one of the greatest movies ever made. 10/10 David Ford"
"evanston_dad","10","2","3","16 June 2009"," The Coens' Best
","I imagine popular opinion now holds that ""No Country for Old Men"" is the best Coen brothers movie ever made, but for me this 1996 crime thriller will live on as their masterpiece.<br/><br/>The Coens have always had trouble integrating their warped sense of humor into their films, and too often they tip the balance over into the grotesque. But in ""Fargo,"" they for once strike the perfect balance between the macabre and the absurd, and though laughs abound, the film never lets us forget the seriousness at the film's center.<br/><br/>The plot revolves around a money scheme gone badly awry, but the scheme itself doesn't matter. The Coens are more interested in watching what can happen to a bunch of ordinary Joes when money lust is involved. Anchoring the film with a beautiful performance is Frances McDormand as pregnant police officer Marge, whose country bumpkin accent and demeanor belies the sharp acuity of her investigative skills. The Coens are frequently mean and snide to their own characters, as if they're making movies about people who they feel superior to, but Marge is one of their most fully-realized and warmly human creations. She's the lioness protecting not only her cub but everyone else's cub as well, and the fact that she goes about her job with a smile and a friendly ""hello"" doesn't make her any less ferocious.<br/><br/>I love the film's final scene, in which Marge and her husband watch the evening news, both without actually speaking the words asking the other just what kind of world they're bringing their unborn child into.<br/><br/>Grade: A+"
"maxime-s-laperle","9","2","3","30 March 2007"," Cinema's most assured masterpiece in the lapse of fifty years ( and I'm not kidding)
","When you think of Fargo, you can simply think of a lot of things, but one thing that can be absolutely and undeniably true, it's the utter beauty of this picture. The Coen Brothers seem to be the catalysts of five of the greatest film directors in history : Ingmar Bergman, Andrei Tarkovsky, John Huston, Brian De Palma, and last but not definitely not least, Nicholas Ray. Fargo breathes in the work of these great directors, simultaneously ! It is so much of a level of talent, that it's simply insane, and I couldn't even afford to kid.<br/><br/>The screenplay and the story, written by the Coens, seem to breathe three great writers of the 20th century : Fyodor Dostoyesky, Anton Tchekov and finally James M. Cain.<br/><br/>God, you cannot even begin to describe the brilliance of structure and style that the film is dealt with. It is as obscure as it is breathtakingly shocking. The acting of William H. Macy is completely at it's peak in this picture, and even today the man is a considerable and magnificent acting genius. Macy is absolutely divine, in portraying the most bleak and opportunistic of cowardice, in the role of this car salesman. He is perfect in this role, as he might not have in the lapse of six years, since 96 at the eve of release of Fargo. But on the downside of things, he has suffered immense type-casting, if you can take the example of another movie The Cooler, in which he plays another meek character. (He should probably hire a better agent, but very good agents are hard to find) He comes off as a second Bob De Niro, in this picture.<br/><br/>The greatest scene and probably the most gruesome scene is the wife's kidnapping. But for now, let's explain the whole universe, which is Fargo. The film opens in the eerie beauty of winter, in harsh snow-falling of Minnesota, located in a small town. Jerry Lundergaard played by Macy, is a car salesman who wants to plan his wife's kidnapping and ransom with two stone-to-death pathetic and amateurish career burglars. He does this in the goal of getting is father-in-law's life insurance of 40 M, as a scam and sharing fifty-fifty with the kidnappers, played by Steve Buscemi, and Peter Storre (or something) That's all you get from me, and I don't care what you do on any given week-end, just watch this brilliant movie. Go every where, find this dang movie, own this dang movie. Me, I've probably seen it 20 times already. Move your butt for this movie, just run to get this movie. I don't care if you're drunk, stoned or something, find this movie, you shall not regret it.<br/><br/>Well that's enough out of me, and that was a film expert's advise."

"matt_tawesson-1","10","2","3","3 April 2006"," Great dose of comedy and thriller!!
","Great movie starring William H. Macy, Frances McDormand, and Steve Buscemi. When I first saw this movie a few years ago on VHS, I had noticed the information notice at the beginning stating that this was based on a true story from 1987. Now I know that this picture was NOT based on a true event from what I learned a while back. How misleading that is. Anyway, the movie is about a young man named Jerry Lundegaard (played by Macy) who works at an auto dealership and hires two guys to kidnap his wife so that he can pay off his debts (his wife was wealthy). Jerry Lundegaard is the kind of guy who was very stupid and not really honest in his ways. Anyone who is in tremendous debt that hires someone to have a relative or relatives of theirs kidnapped and/or killed in order to pay off his or her own debts is surely asking to get themselves landed in prison. Right after Jerry's wife is kidnapped, he comes back home to find that his wife is not there and ""acts"" like he's worried and concerned. His concerned feelings are very phony and all he wanted was to get greedy, just to pay off his debts. To me, Jerry was a selfish guy. I have absolutely NO RESPECT, WHATSOEVER for people who try to pay off their own debts by hiring someone to kidnap and/or kill their wealthy relatives. Then, when he gets in touch with the two men he ""hired"" to do this awful and sadistic deed some more, things get out of hand for him. The guys demand more money (they're just as greedy as Jerry), they had killed three people on the evening of the same day that they kidnapped the wife (a state trooper who was just doing his job by pulling them over for forgetting to put the temporary tags on this new car was shot, and two passers by who slowed down to witness what was going on were shot as well). Frances McDormand gave a wonderful performance as the very pregnant officer chief assigned to the case. This is a movie worth watching with lots of comical scenes (not the ones of violence, of course) and some dramatic ones as well. It is worth watching. I also like the Indian guy, Shep Proudfoot. He was seen a few times in the movie, but I thought he was funny as well. Check the scene where he gets back at the guy at his residence. That is something!!!!"
"Surecure","9","2","3","22 February 2006"," Wry, off-beat and undeniably brilliant
","What can be said of Fargo that has not been said before? Fargo is a film that cannot be cornered with any easy definition. The Coen brothers have defined themselves with a style that is unique and refreshing and Fargo stands as one of their masterworks. Equal parts crime-caper, drama and comedy, Fargo takes its audience on a journey where every turn is a breathe of fresh air and every line of dialog is something that you could never translate to another film.<br/><br/>Frances McDormand shines in her lead role as the pregnant cop who has a small-town, matter-of-fact way about her that is both endearing and unpredictable, a performance easily earning her Oscar win. William H Macy is as memorable as ever as the car dealer whose ransom master-plan and life spins further and further out of control. And while Steve Buscemi is known for his quirky performances, in Fargo his quirkiness almost seems to make his character appear the most ""normal"" of the bunch.<br/><br/>While certainly not a film for everybody (many in my family still don't know what to make of it) it is an easy recommendation for anybody who wants to experience a truly unique, original film. The barren landscape of mid-winter Fargo certainly hides a spectrum of colorful scenarios that amount to a wholly entertaining film."
"bill_golden","9","2","3","24 November 2005"," Great flick with a too abrupt ending
","What more can be said after 487 viewer comments? For #488, all I will say is that, after watching this three times, Fargo is a fine piece of cinema, with an emphasis on a minimalist approach to story-telling and without much in the way of theatrics. The setting is bleak, the dialog is mostly direct and to-the-point, and the characters are well-drawn, what few main characters there are. I thought Steve Buscemi was wonderful as the villain in a humorously sick way. The one negative comment I have is that I feel the movie ends much too abruptly: too many loose threads left hanging. I thought the viewer was entitled to know a little bit more about why Jerry (William H. Macy) would go to such outlandish lengths to raise money as to stage his own wife's kidnapping. The fact that he ""owed money"" or ""got in over his head"" wasn't quite enough for me as an explanation since I had kept asking myself during the course of this escapade, ""Why? Exactly why is he doing this?"" We never really find out except in the most vague terms. All in all, probably my favorite Coen Brothers film."

"aedixon-1","8","2","3","18 March 2005"," True story or not?
","I enjoyed this movie, for the same reasons as previous commenters did. I also liked the absence of hackneyed plot devices, such as the McDormand character being taken off the case but solving it anyway, or a turf war between the local police and the FBI.<br/><br/>However, I notice that the opening credits say that the story is true, while the closing credits say that it is entirely fictional. For a while I thought that it was a true story, then I realized that the murder of three people, including a police officer, would be taken very seriously. Instead of the case being given to one uniformed officer, a team of homicide detectives would descend on the scene.<br/><br/>It would have been better if the makers of the movie had been straightforward about whether the movie is true."
"doodah367","10","2","3","27 December 2003"," A favourite of mine (potential spoiler)
","There is something a little novel about reviewing a film released half a decade ago  I'm writing this after watching Fargo for the fourth time, not the first, so this really should be preceded by the following disclaimer: Fargo is one of my favourite films - ever.<br/><br/>Bringing together an ensemble group of ever so slightly eccentric characters and thrusting them into the epitome of small-town America  Fargo tells the story of a scam gone wrong  mainly due to the utter incompetence of its protagonists.  On many levels, this is a film primarily about its characters  the inability of people to communicate, the repulsive Have a Nice Day' aesthetic of the nineties and humanity's greatest vice: a constant desire for more money.  In this way, Marge  perfectly portrayed with the correct amount of conviction and humour by Frances McDormand  is the lead role. She is a woman who likes people and loves their inner good  shown by her affection for fumbling husband Norm  and there is barely anything more disheartening in the film than the extended close-up of her melancholic face after discovering the extent of Mike's lies  this is the point where she becomes disillusioned with people, and this only increases as she comes face to face with Grimsrud.<br/><br/>However, Fargo is about a lot more than people and humanity  and, aside from Marge, there are many protagonists.  It is also a film about violence and the inability to escape from violence.  Shot against such a beautiful, invariably white backdrop, the red of blood becomes increasingly shocking  simply accentuating the horror of violence in this small-town society. Characters resort to violence simply because they have no other outlet for their inability to communicate  Carl shoots Wade simply because he is frustrated at Jerry's non-appearance, there is no possible gain for him in this murder.  <br/><br/>There is not a bad thing to say about Fargo  the writing is perfectly spot-on, juxtaposing blackly hilarious lines with extreme violence, Deakins' cinematography is breathtaking, encompassing seemingly endless landscapes of snow-white, and there is not a bad apple amongst the cast.  Everything is rounded off with a cherry on top  the subtle Coen Brothers directorial touch  the ability to either exploit the funniest thing in every frame or create humour in something that is distinctly serious.  Much attention has been given to the auteur status of the Coens, and I do think that Fargo is unmistakably their work - possibly their finest hour in a fine canon of cinema.  Just simply perfect.<br/><br/>10/10"

I admit, with such high expectations I was a little let down for the first 30-40 minutes, then the film kicked into high gear and I was immensely satisfied by the end.<br/><br/>This isn't a movie for regular viewers so much as it is a film for movie lovers. Even then, I enjoyed this movie 9/10. It gets a 10/10 because I find it rather flawless for what it is-there is little to no room for improvement. Recommend anyone to give a try sometime.

"sabuj-70235","9","1","1","4 December 2019"," Cold
","The first thing that I realized while watching the movie was the environment of the location. I realized, this is a story which is about the darkness of human conscience. Almost every part of the movie was located in frozen Minnesota, which is covered with white snow and under the white earth there is a river of blood. The red is soaked by the snow, just like the human evilness is covered by house, clothes, job etc. Throughout the movie we see no logic and no remorse behind the murders. People dies because of no reason at all and people kill them because of no reason at all. The greatest thing about this movie is the coldness of the characters. We see characters go through the story and nothing changes their greed or the evilness inside them. This is not a movie about good vs evil where in the end goodness will overcome the evil. Because the story is the evil fuel of this movie. Though we see the murderers get caught at the end, still it showed no indication that this was some uncommon or unique story that happens once in a decade. The thing this movie portrays is that, this whole story was some ordinary thing and it was the glimpse of the murders that are done because of greed in this world."
"fpcholcomb","9","1","1","1 December 2019"," It's Never Too Cold for Murder
","Fargo contrasts the snowy quiet that accompanies Minneapolis simple living with scenes of excessive violence and depravity to create an unsettling yet captivating experience for the viewer.<br/><br/>On one hand, you have one of my favorite female characters of all time Marge Gunderson, played expertly by Frances McDormand, who is a talented and good natured police officer who just so happens to be pregnant and engaged in one of the most wholesome relationships ever put to screen with her husband Norm. And then, on the other hand, you have two psychopathic kidnappers and a mild-mannered family man who engineers some base plans.<br/><br/>I love Marges character because it contrasts heavily with the standard grizzled veteran cop with a dark past but is good at his job stereotype subverting a well established movie trope, and I love the kidnappers because they are just so different from literally every other character in the movie. I hate Jerry because his kind Minnesotan demeanor belies his scheming corrupt nature.<br/><br/>The Coen brothers are undisputed masters and the cinematography here is breathtaking. There are so many beautiful shots of the snowy and sparsely populated landscape of Fargo. The snow acts as a kind of obscuring and calming presence on screen, almost turning it into a horror movie-esq fog that is meant to cultivate uncertainty. It seems so cold there you cannot really imagine someone mustering up the energy to commit violence out there.<br/><br/>All the violent scenes are expertly done and expertly contrasted illuminating a terror lurking in the quiet simple American life, greed. And the setting is just so... inoccient and quiet. I love how ever character from Minnesota, especially Jerry, excessively uses the words ""Oh yeah"" and ""Oh geeze"" when communicating, they are not the kind you anticipate to deal with grizzly murders.<br/><br/>There are also a lot more subtle little things the Coen brothers show the viewer that helps emphasize just how wholesome and quiet this place is, one of my favorites being that Jerry's kid, rather than having the traditional bikini pictures on his wall as you might expect from a near puberty adolescent, has a picture of an accordion player on his door. There is also a scene where two ladies of the night are interviewed, and rather than appearing hardened or overly sexual as they normally would in the movies, the Coen brothers have them act like simple young adults who are extremely innocent and unfortunately more than a little slow.<br/><br/>I could go on and on talking about little things in the interactions between characters, the plain setting of nearly every location in the film, or the creeping yet strangely hollow score but that may take up a lot more space than I intend to. Suffice it to say that this is a simple tale of the tribulation of a good mother, the sin of a deadbeat father, and the death of not only people, but the myth of the peaceful quiet life.<br/><br/>We may not understand why some people end up so rotten, but we can love each other as best we can and try our best to do good, and honestly, isn't that enough?"

","I am completing my Coen brothers revision with their most popular movie, ""Fargo"", a picture that I've seen countless times in the past and every time feels like new. Joel and Ethan Coen write and direct a dark, gloomy and pessimistic Neo-noir film which casts some of the actors who appear in many flicks by the dyad such as Frances McDormand and Steve Buscemi<br/><br/>There is a touch of black humor in the story of ""Fargo"" and the movie begins with Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Masey), a cars salesman, asking two thugs, portrayed flawlessly by Buscemi and the Swedish thespian, Peter Stormare, to kidnap his own wife in order to take the ransom money. Jerry is involved in massive-scale fraud and he needs cash urgently or else he will have to face the consequences. But unfortunately, Jerry is not built for these kind of endeavors so the plan soon goes awry and blood begins shedding in the small town of Brainerd in Minnesota. Police chief Marge Gunderson (F. McDormand) is the officer that investigates the case of a triple murder, committed by the two criminals who also kidnapped Jerry's wife, Jean. Well, I will not say any more about the plot so you could relish this excellent Neo-noir one-hundred percent.<br/><br/>""Fargo"" is darker and gloomier if compared with other Coen's crime films and the cinematography is full of the dull color of snow mirroring the grey sky. The plot moves forward in a steady, rather fast, tempo and there is total absence of redundant scenes or dialogue. It is a tight-plotted movie that counts on its memorable atmosphere, its imagery captured by Joel and Ethan's lens. The performances are also immaculate and the overall result is a film that it's deemed to be considered classic in the future. Any true crime fiction aficionado ought to see this film and I can guarantee that they won't regret it."

"ShitizSays","8","1","1","11 August 2019"," The most unconventional zany crime drama have ever seen
","Fargo is a film that usually other films are not.
It break rules of film making like crushing the fruits in a mixer.
It is the story of Jerry who has this plan to get his wife kidnapped by two low life criminals Carl and Grimsrud.
Just like his name Grimsrud is a grim man who does not like to speak too much while Carl on the other hand is quite talkative and pretends to think too much but always ending up finding himself in a mess.
Jerry's father in law is a rich man who doesn't seem to like or respect Jerry a bit. Jerry is a car sales executive in a showroom and think that he deserves to be compensated and helped by his father in law.
His wife Jean is a satisfied housewife who is completely settled in her middle class life. She doesn't care about her father's abundance of money and her husband's lack of money.
The kidnapping is done but the kidnapping also leads to three irresponsible and avoidable murders on the road by Grimsrud where we also get to see his dark and unpredictable nature.
The small scheme of kidnapping and asking his father in law for money goes haywire and now involves murder, This is where Marge comes in.
Marge is the Police Chief in the area and her family is as normal as it can be.
Her husband and her, were both in Police once but then her husband left his job and spends time painting while Marge is working as Police chief.
Marge is good at her job but she is very girly from inside. She is also conservative in her nature. She is going through her first pregnancy period and also solves the case like that.
The best part about Fargo is its non-genre defining structure. The film is not funny yet the way character behaves you always feel something funny in the scenes. You think it is going to be a funny film when suddenly there is murders and blood all over the place and still the film appears to be funny.
You are never sure which mood you should carry while watching the film.
The character of Marge impresses you more than anything.
There were two things which I think was difficult for anyone to digest initially about her. First was her pregnancy and second was her meeting with her old friend Mike.
Mike, at first appears to be interested in Marge despite knowing that she is happily married and pregnant. We become sure of it when he hugs for longer time than it usually takes for someone to hug and also he forcefully tries to sit next to her. Mike says that he is going through a tough period and his wife has recently died. Marge feels sad for him.
Later Marge comes to know from another former classmate that Mike was lying and his wife is healthy as a bull.
This is the key factor which makes Marge conclude that maybe Jerry is lying about his wife too.
This results in her catching the criminals and Jerry.
I love how Marge says ""Yeah"" when she is talking on phone which is very synonymous to any housewife lingo. It goes against her profession of a Police chief.
She is pregnant which makes her vulnerable but that doesn't stop her from doing things that she has to do. She works all day long and yet manages to find time for her husband and her home.
Fargo is one of the rarest examples of how you can mix multiple genres into one and escape successfully into it.
The film never answers your questions and is crazily unapologetic.
It never tells you what happened to all the money that Carl buried in the snow.
It never tells you what happened to Jerry's wife and his son.
The film was good because though it never answers all these questions yet you kind of feel satisfied that every wrong guy met their fate. Jerry and Grimsrud both gets arrested.
I love how they end the film with what can be the most cliched dialogue in the film.
Marge says, ""Why kill so many people for little amount of money?""
This shows the contradictory innocent nature of Marge and how despite working in Police and catching criminals all the time, somehow her innocence isn't tampered with. She just can't understand why people commit crime. Life is too normal for her.
This Oscar winning drama is definitely a must watch."

This movie is entertaining from the beginning to the end, the actors did a very good perfomance. The story is simple and may have alredy been used in another movie, but still a good decent movie."

","Fargo is a masterpiece that made the Coen brothers Hollywood royalty. It has an absurd, fun story with over the top violence, fun and well remembered characters, great performances with really good cinematography. Fargo is not your regular mystery movie.

And then while watching the movie, I kept going back and forth with the screenplay and the movie playing.<br/><br/>It is an absolute delight to see what the Coen Brothers have conjured up. The characters, the actors chosen, the setting in Minnesota/Minneapolis, the dialogues, the attention to detail all work cohesively. It's a brilliant work of creative filmmaking.<br/><br/>I was spellbound from beginning to end. I think you really feel like you're there with them in the year 1996. Filmmaking has come a long way since then however a classic piece of filmmaking simply cannot be overlooked.<br/><br/>I give this 8/10 for the amount of madness the Coen brothers have been able to squeeze in 1 hour and 38 minutes. Real good then."

"davispittman","9","1","1","19 April 2018"," Frances McDormand shines!
","Fargo (1996) is a Cohen Brothers film, starring Frances McDormand and William H. Macy. <br/><br/>I watched this film because of McDormand mainly, she's just such a great actress and I knew anything with her in a starring role would surely be great. And I was 100% right, Francs McDormand does not disappoint one bit as the lead, Margie, who's a Minnesota police officer. She is investigating a case of three homicides, and it turns out to be attached to something much bigger. William H. Macy plays a man who is trying to come into some money, he hires two men to kidnap his wife and arranges for his very wealthy father in law to pay the ransom. <br/><br/>The performances in this film are top notch, Macy and McDormand give it their all. The writing is great too, the dialogue for each character suits them perfectly. It's so great to see a film with both great acting and smart writing. The ending is especially well done. The Cohen Brothers hardly ever make a bad film, and this one is just of the examples of that being true. Fargo gets a 9/10. <br/><br/>Definitely on my must watch list."
"jamheigei","9","1","1","21 March 2018"," Fantastic crime movie
","Fargo is agreat movie on so many levels. First of all: The story is awesome. Not the type of crime story you find often, really original and especially well-written. I love how in the beginning you feel sorry for Mr. Lundegaard and you want to keep that feeling so bad, but by the end it becomes so clear that there's really no reason for feeling sorry. 
All the characters are protrayed spot-on, I enjoyed Frances McDormand's performance in particular (like everybody probably). Also, the dialogues and humor are just classic by now.
Another very nice thing is the very original cinematography, often not using typical thriller elements and adding a taste of drama to the flick. Visuals and sound are executed meticulously, you see and hear so many little details that not everybody would have thought of.
The last thing I want to add that I liked was the runtime. At 98 minutes, it's anything but a long movie and squeezing a complex, yet understandable and entertaining plot in there is quite achievement.<br/><br/>I loved Fargo, there's really nothing bad that comes to mind."
"tylerduswalt","10","1","1","8 March 2018"," The Coen Brothers at their Best
","Fargo is a product of the Coen brothers at their best. It claims to be a true story, although it is very loosely based on an actual crime, and the claim is more of a way for the Coen brothers to present their film with a tongue-in-cheek forewarning that the absurdity you are about to witness is entirely factual. The film's tagline is ""a homespun murder story,"" yet the film has much more merit and value to it than this humble statement suggests. Comprised of a network of simpletons way in over their heads in what was supposed to be a relatively victimless crime, Fargo's claim to be unsophisticated speaks more to the incompetence of those involved in the staged kidnapping of Jean Lundegaard than the film itself. The movie seamlessly blends excessive violence, dark humor, apathy, satire, sadism, copious snow, Minnesota accents, and more without misstepping. This is a testament to the film's incredibly high quality: incorporating these elements and striking a balance in them is certainly a difficult task. Joel and Ethan Coen took extraordinary risks to translate their vision to screen, and their bold decisions certainly paid off.
Jerry Lundegaard, a car salesman with an increasingly apparent lack of empathy, begins as our protagonist. He's played by William H. Macy, who perfectly portrays an afraid man who constantly tries to worm his way out of situations created by an ill-thought out plan. Jerry only wants the ""ransom"" money without any trouble, but as murders begin popping all over the map up by the hands of Carl Showalter (Steve Buscemi) and Gaear Grimsrud (Peter Stormare), starting due to Carl's lack of tags on the tan Sierra, there is a shift in who steps into the role of protagonist: Marge Gunderson, a chief officer late in her pregnancy played by Frances McDormand. What makes McDormand's character so enticing, besides her oscar-winning performance, is how she's against people and motives she doesn't understand. After the shocking wood-chipper scene, she handcuffs Gaear and begs the question: how can a man give up the rest of his life and take away so many others' lives for a bit of money? Materialism is a common theme here, as it is what triggers this disastrous series of events. We see Jerry lie both in and out of the workplace, and, whether his words are directed to a customer or his loved ones, they always sound like a sales pitch with a hint of desperation. As the scheme becomes more convoluted and things become traceable to him, he finds it harder to bide his time.
 A part of what makes this movie so original is how it uses humor to bring light to a very dark ordeal. Minnesota accents aside, the Coen brothers create hilarious exchanges between simple folk so that there's a ""yer dern tootin'"" or an ""aw heck"" for every killing at the hands of Stormare's expressionless mute or Buscemi's inept loudmouth. You are allowed to laugh at the misfortune because the film is essentially as unsympathetic as its characters. It's hard to refrain from finding someone like Carl and his spewing frustration hilarious, despite his and Gaear's awful deeds. The dialogue is perfectly tailored to the setting and to each person, and you'll find that remarks are often repeated in scenes, getting only funnier each time (""we're not a bank, Jerry;"" ""he's kinda funny lookin'""). Characters discuss the best buffets around, pancakes, homicide, loneliness, and faxes, all complemented by a gorgeous soundtrack and backdrop filled with a plethora of snow and tire tracks. No character is without value to the film (even Mike Yanagita, who helps Margie realize Jerry may be lying to her); Norm Gunderson is a shining example of the 3-cent stamp whose purpose is to keep the 29-cent stamp balanced, happy, and thriving. Fargo is in master-class territory, a film begging for its viewers to find themselves past that Paul Bunyan statue once again to revisit its snowy, violent, simple offerings, and I couldn't recommend it more to any appreciative moviegoer."
"TheDonaldofDoom","8","1","1","1 February 2018"," Funny and tragic
","Maybe this is because Fargo was more revolutionary at its time of release but I don't see it as a masterpiece judging it by today's standards. It's a crime story with no real shocks or twists (although the wood chipper scene comes close). That said, it's an entertaining film with its unique humour and great characters.<br/><br/>It's funny and slapstick enough that you can't take it too seriously, yet not so much so that you don't care about the characters at all. The irony is woven in very well, with what was intended as a way for its protagonist to get more money ending up being a complete disaster. The criminals are bad no doubt, but they're so inept at what they do (even the silent one who at first seems to actually know what he's doing) that I can't feel a deep hatred for them, despite their evil crimes. They're too pitiful for that.<br/><br/>In Fargo, nobody wins. Jerry's plan fails, only leading to the death of his innocent wife and his own arrest. Carl and Gaear's plan to make the money fails as well, with one of them dead and the other in prison. The money is still buried in the snow. The bad guys are caught, but that's no consolation for all the damage that has been done. Marge can only shake her head at the tragedy of it. The funniest part of all this is that the reason the plan failed was because none of the criminals trusted each other to stick to their agreement. And because the law wasn't on the side of any of them, it's not like they could go to the police about a broken agreement!<br/><br/>The final scene, where Marge and Norm reveal they're going to have a child, is perfect. The message is clear. People will tear their families apart and destroy their lives for a bit of cash, ignoring that true happiness was right under their nose all along."

","Fargo is an intelligently comedic, violent, emotional, and dark composite that's certainly one of the quirkiest pictures I can ever recall seeing. <br/><br/>Prior to writing up this review, I read the comment that Fargo can never decide what genre it seeks to be. Despite my grievances with this comment, I do believe that at times Fargo's various elements could've been integrated more effectively. However, these elements are all accomplished and the overall picture is a commendably smooth venture. <br/><br/>In regard to Fargo's black humour, to some extent at times I struggled to conclude which material was intended to be humorous, and that which was intended to be serious and impactful, as the borderline between the two felt slightly blurred. <br/><br/>Much like the picture itself, Fargo hosts a plethora of quirky and unique personas, made even more credible by the distinguished efforts of Macy and McDormand.<br/><br/>Fargo's intelligence is reflected in it's subtle lines of dialogue, events or shots that mimic or reference similar material featured earlier in the film is consistently used to phenomenal effect. <br/><br/>It should be noted that the ending sequence is a commendable and reflective accomplishment that demonstrates how self aware the Coen's were of their creation."

","'FARGO' - 1996<br/><br/>Directed by Ethan and Joel Coen<br/><br/>Starring William H Macey, Frances McDormand and Steve Buscemi<br/><br/>Plot Overview: ​In an attempt to fund an unknown project, Jerry Lundergaard(William H Macy) hired two criminals, Carl(Steve Buscemi) and Gaear(Peter Stromrare) to kidnap his wife and hold her for a million dollar random, against her incredibly wealthy father. But in the meantime, pregnant police chief Marge(Frances McDormand) is hunting the criminals for a crime they committed amidst the job.<br/><br/>My first taste of the Coen Brother's work was with a little movie called 'The Big Lebowski'. I thoroughly enjoyed it and thought it was a brilliant 'joke' of a movie. Not in terms of quality but of content. After seeing 'The Big Lebowski', I began to hunger for seeing the remainder of their work. And thus I came onto this little gem of a movie. Fargo is, in my opinion, much better than The Big Lebowski and is a comedic crime story of epic proportions. If you haven't already seen it, I recommend you check it out!<br/><br/>But what is actually GOOD about the movie? Well, the story certainly springs to mind. From second one until the first name on the credits, Fargo gripped me and held me hostage on the edge of my seat. I was captivated by the events on screen and drawn deep into the mysterious and ingenious world, devised by the Coens. And while the statement about this being based on true events is a false one, it may as well have been true because the Coens do their absolute best to convince you that it is all the way through.<br/><br/>So what else was excellent? The performances? Yeah, I will agree with that. William H Macey delivers a truly amazing performance as Jerry Lundergaard and kept me entwined in his conniving scheme all the way until the end of the movie. Frances McDormand also does a sensational job as Marge and provides much of the backbone for which the movie rests on. McDormand is a relatively unknown actress in the film world(she was to me anyhow) but she proves that she deserves more recognition with her Oscar Worthy(and winning) performance. And then there is there is Stevie 'Slimeball' Buscemi. Whenever I see this guy speak or move in any of his roles, I get goosebumps. Whether that is a testament to his marvellous acting capabilities or his perverted face, I don't know. All I do know is that the man is an awesome actor and that is certainly no different here. Harve Presnell was also very good as Wade Gustafson.<br/><br/>Despite not saying much and having a minimal role, Peter Stromrae delivers a truly amazing performance and steals a lot of the scenes he is in. It was truly and incredible performance. I mean, I've admired the man in other roles, both in TV and film, but this is the first time he has genuinely amazed me and made me see his enormous potential as an actor. You probably think I am overselling him but I don't care.<br/><br/>Thirdly, the cinematography and editing are exceptional. Fargo is a fantastic looking movie and it is a visual treat. Even the costume and set designs look fantastic and well thought out. It is a very, very technically proficient movie.<br/><br/>If I was to say one flaw, it'd be that the ending wraps up a little too quickly. I think it was overly abrupt and maybe an extra 5 minutes would have done to let it settle and flourish. Maybe that is just me but that is honestly my main flaw with the movie.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I can wholeheartedly say that I recommend Fargo. The comedic moments intertwine with the dramatic moments perfectly. They fit like a glove and do nothing to take away from the movie. The story is great, the acting is exceptional, the visuals are gorgeous; what is NOT to like in such a well rounded and thought out movie? Well I've already told you one thing but I challenge thee to find another. I highly recommend this movie; I'll rate it 9 'YARS' out of 10!"

","The first time I saw Fargo and the credits rolled with the impeccable theme song, I had a feeling in my gut that I had seen an incredible work of cinema.<br/><br/>The Coen brothers are absolute geniuses, and this is their best work.<br/><br/>Fargo will make you laugh, it will make you feel nauseated by the violence, but most of all, it will make you think. I wrote an extended essay on the meaning behind the perfectly timed comedy, and how the Coen brothers are genius even in the goofiest of writing. Their exploration of gender roles and greed really make you wonder about the world.<br/><br/>Everyone should see this movie. But not kids. They would get kind of messed up if they watched it too young."

","I like very much Frances and that was my motivation to see this movie. It was a great surprise to see that William « Frank » Macy stars also, all the more than his character could be the sober twin of the Gallagers family patriarch. On the other hand, it was a disappointment to notice Stormare as this actor really cringes me with his too much attitude verified as always in this movie. As i have written in my review for « Arizona Junior », the Cohen brothers are the movies cousin of Stephen King as they are really share this taste for the rural America. Here, the country land is all the more put in relief as it's winter time. The story is interesting because it's a true drama that is chilly as it's unbelievable that the husband found such a stupid idea and such bums to help him ! In this strange world, Frances is totally exceptional : i can't really explain but she has the gift to put me at rest, to make me happy and her character is really like this : she smiles to everyone, she is respected by her friends, her co-workers, she has a caring husband and will be soon a mother. It's a really change from the today cops as violent as the criminals they arrest. This Frances recalls Columbo, Dale Cooper, Fox Mulder, the strong arm of the law but with a big heart. She worths truly her Oscar and the movie is really good !"
"siderite","7","1","1","25 June 2014"," A list of my favorite actors in a film that is both real and completely boring
","I understand the positive reviews, I really do. The story is non conventional, based on real events that lack the serendipity and skill of movie events. The actors, some of my favorites are in it, play very well. The mix of dread, disgust, contempt and amusement has a nice flavour, too. But the film is too real, too mundane and ultimately totally boring. It's like a heist movie done by idiots, but dangerous idiots at that.<br/><br/>Bottom line: I really wanted to like this film, because they just released a series based on it. However, after watching it, I can't bring myself to view the series. The average grade that I give this film doesn't mean that I am indifferent to it, just that it kind of hits mediocrity, but that only because I average good acting and intriguing potential with my feeling of utter boredom after watching it."

","On the strength of liking the rather coarse In Bruges I was recommended to see this one, one that had passed me by but trailed for me by the recommender as an even blacker comedy. Being a sucker for black comedies I complied, and found it ingenious and engrossing fiction, but with a streak of nastiness not in In Bruges. Brainerd definitely looked colder than Bruges!<br/><br/>Geeky husband (Macy) arranges for two hit men, one dumb the other kind of funny looking, to kidnap his wife so they can all share the ransom money to come from her rich father. Except it all goes wrong - especially for a lot of innocent passers by, which is something I always find difficult to extract humour from as I never know what or in particular who lies around the next corner myself. Some funny alleged Minnesota mannerisms and accents from the cast, the pregnant Sheriff Marge had some of the most whimsical lines and was a convincing eccentric, to this outsider anyway. Favourite bits: Her police outrage when she sees Macy Fleein' The Interview; the funny looking guy getting shot in the teeth and continually whinging about it; trying to guess exactly how Macy's wife met her end, how often Ya was uttered throughout and where's the money buried. Nice photography and the music was atmospheric and excellent too, although it sometimes put in mind 17th century France. I just wish the main characters and their many foibles had been fleshed out a little more, otoh it was all nicely packed into 90 minutes...maybe the rather pointless meeting of Marge with Mike could have been jettisoned?<br/><br/>Although redolent of Twin Peaks it's one of the best films from the '90's I've seen from my limited experience, episodic but good and enigmatic enough to bear repeated viewings."
"Steffi_P","8","1","1","9 February 2012"," ""Funny-lookin'""
","In the 1990s the younger generation of independent filmmakers gained their prestige with some odd movies, movies that were both grim and noir-ish but with an almost nonchalant twist of comedy running through all the nastiness. This was the kind of picture in which the Brothers Coen specialised. Fargo is among their purest expressions of that type, a grisly thriller set in a snowbound Minnesota that, despite its inherent darkness, comes across as humane and affectionate.<br/><br/>While the New Wave-influenced directors showed off an abundance of technique, the Coens and their generation have tended more towards minimalism. There's an elegant simplicity to their approach, with few camera moves or obvious artifice. That's not to say the Coens were directing on autopilot. The camera may not move but there's a lot of thought gone into those static shots. We see a beleaguered William H. Macy at his desk while cars rushing by on the freeway behind him seem to mirror his nervous jitters. In the opposing shot of the indignant couple, the array of statuettes makes it look as if the whole room's ganging up on him. It's a kind of meaningful shot composition that is actually rather witty. This triumph of the image over technicality allows the Coens to really bring out some detail. Many filmmakers may attach a camera to the front of a car for a bit of high-speed action, but in Fargo we have such a shot pointing down at the road surface in the headlights, picking out every little crack and grain. The Coens have really painted a world with palpable texture.<br/><br/>But just as character seems to live in the very landscape of Fargo, it also lives in the actual characters, brought to vividness by a cast that's at just the right level of quirky. What's neat about Frances McDormand is that she is comical without actually doing a comedy performance. Other than a slightly strained accent, its all done in very genuine timings and expressions, which stops it slipping into farce and weaves it well with the movie's more unpleasant moments. William H. Macy is full of twitches and mannerisms, but he just manages to pull it inside the realms of believability. And Steve Buscemi too is straddling that delicate line on the edge of reality. In short, the people that inhabit the world of Fargo give us this impression of normality stretched to its limits, but normality all the same.<br/><br/>Unlike your average thriller, Fargo is not exactly a tightly-constructed ride of suspense and excitement, but this doesn't mean it's not enjoyable and engrossing. Rather than seeming to have some grand theme or focused structure, it's as if the screenplay just grew organically out of a number of elements. Like many works by the Brothers Coen, Fargo is rich with the weirdness of America, with ominous statues of local heroes and checkout girls grinning vacantly like a taxi driver from Total Recall. Brilliantly offset by a doom-laden and very Nordic score from Carter Burwell as well as a sprinkling of familiar American hits, it scampers smoothly from one mood to the next. This isn't a big movie by any stretch, but it in its constant, delightful diversity, it seems to be part of some large and tangible world."

Peter Stormare is scary alone and should be considered as one of the most feared cold blooded killers from the 90's.<br/><br/>The settings are claustrophobic even if we talk about a highway!

When I watch a movie or a play, the first thing I try to do is figure out the story line: what's going on. This one had me stumped for a while, but I finally settled on something out of Shakespeare, and in particular, either King Lear or Richard III. Richard III seemed to make more sense to me: there's enough of Shakespearian blood and gore for most, and yet there are comic overtones that fit right in. I think the writing was brilliant, the score very well matched, the acting superb.<br/><br/>If the essence of classical tragedy is that the ending is foregone from the start, then this is classical tragedy. If the essence of comedy is unexpected juxtaposition, then this has elements of that, too. The wood chipper scene is a riot, but you'll have to see the movie to understand why I say that.<br/><br/>We watched it on a night when a storm was blowing by: rain on the windows, wind howling, a glass or two of wine. It all worked to perfection. Don't worry if you're scratching your head trying to figure it out: I think that's part of what it's all about."
"MartianOctocretr5","7","1","1","6 July 2006"," Quirky characters, dark humor
","A movie that's hard to categorize, because, quite frankly, it's so weird. It's innovative and artistic, with quirky characters and an offbeat approach.<br/><br/>Dark humor can be difficult to digest sometimes, and that is my one major criticism of the film as several innocents suffer or even die violently. The movie doesn't seem to care, as it scurries along in an effort to showcase its weirdest characters. Sheriff Marge Gunderson (skillfully portrayed by Frances McDormond) is the only character who seems to notice that the victims are human beings. She's the protagonist with a calm demeanor and low key, Columbo style approach to the grisly crime she is investigating. She also serves symbolically as the only force of peace and sanity in this film's bizarre universe.<br/><br/>In stark and comedic contrast to her are all the freaks. William H. Macy is brilliant as a car salesman who would try to sell an Eskimo an air conditioner. He hatches a foolhardy scheme involving two thugs to get some quick cash which starts to unravel. His efforts to keep on talking his way through everything reminds one of a guy trying to talk his way out of quicksand. His father-in-law is equally nutty; a zillionaire whose every conversation resembles a board-room style exec meeting with his ever-present business partner.<br/><br/>The two crooks are just psychos, perhaps patterned after the two slime balls in ""In Cold Blood."" One is an idiot who never shuts up and errantly imagines he's the brains of the partnership; the other a mindless automaton who rarely speaks, but the wheels are always turning in his head. When he acts, he is devoid of any emotional response--just like a machine calculating, and reacting with ruthless efficiency.<br/><br/>The actors work all of these over the top characters well, and the film delights in bouncing them off each other. The dark humor is at times brutal, but overall this movie is an entertaining watch."
"Hairy_Lime","10","1","1","30 October 2005"," This Is Why We Go To Movies
","Spoilers To me the interesting thing about the movie is the introduction, about half way through the movie, of the Gunderson family. Until that point, the movie was a very well done thriller, reminding me strongly of the Coen Brothers' first film, Blood Simple, in the way it followed the long, obvious unraveling of a crime, every little mistake being far more obvious to the viewers than the characters. And then suddenly, the movie has a moral center to contrast the darkness of the plot.<br/><br/>At first Margie seems to be almost a cartoon rather than a person, but what you realize over the course of the movie is that what she is is human: good at her job, loving to her husband, kind to her coworkers and subordinates, just... nice. And she wraps up the crime at the end with a great little speech emphasizing the human view, without us even realizing that it is that... For a little bit of money. And here you are. And it's a beautiful day. And, well, I just don't understand it. Now that you put it that way, neither do I.<br/><br/>This is a movie that is almost uniformly excellent; the cast, headed by Macy, MacDormand and Buscemi, is perfect - I cannot think of any other actors who would be better for the lead roles. The script is spot on in the way it sees and develops its characters, and the way people actually talk. The Coen Brothers' taste for the quirky qua quirky is much more muted here, but it still adds just the right touch of the other to keep the movie riveting. And the cinematography catches the vast empty whiteness of the northern winter perfectly.<br/><br/>Everything that brings me to movies is in here: great acting, great dialogs, surprises, amusement, shock, beauty, harshness, humanity."

","Fargo is a film wherein the expertise of the Coen brothers creates gold!<br/><br/>ALL their films are excellent, especially The Great Lebowski and O, Brother Where Art Thou.<br/><br/>The Coens are adept at assembling excellent casts: ensembles if you will. But Fargo, of all their movies, has a magic element: if one ignores those amazingly white settings, the dialogue and characters would sing upon a stage. There is a constant flow, even through the 'car salesman' scenes which carries us into the home: to the seemingly neurotic wife and the (always) oppressive father-in-law. Dare one indicate that the script owes much to European theatre? Well, yes.<br/><br/>Part of the charm (and one should accept that this is an EXTREMELY black comedy) revolves around the (almost) patois spoken. Oh, ja? OK. MOST of the charm, however, is based around Marge (Frances McDormand), a very pregnant Police Chief who has a mind like a steel-trap! Given that (at least for the males not within her immediate sphere of influence) her femininity and pregnancy would seem to detract from her investigation, she carries all before her. Marge Gunderson is a wonderful role model. What an irony that McDormand won 'best actress', in as much as her character was up against such powerful opposition. Still, I think the best irony was that her husband appeared to be a non-entity (although amazingly supportive - breakfasts, putting up with her snoring, and always a comforting arm) who, at the end of the film, proved to be a success in his own right.<br/><br/>OK. I waxed lyrical. Macey, Buscemi and Stormare complete what is, essentially, a working ensemble. Is this good? You betcha!"

","Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) hatches an ill-conceived plan to have his wife kidnapped, and use ransom money shelled out by his wealthy father-in-law to finance his solo business venture. Human stupidity ensures that every single element of the plan fails catastrophically.<br/><br/>Fargo marks the Coens' acceptance by the mainstream. The award nominations showered upon it and its widespread critical acclaim may have set high expectations from viewers, whom, upon inspection shrug in disappointment, failing to find either the verbal gold of Big Lebowski and Miller's Crossing, or the visual wizardry of O Brother Where Art Thou and The Man Who Wasn't There. Of all their films, Fargo might be the most palatable to mainstream sensibilities, but that does not diminish its qualities as a film.<br/><br/>In technical terms, this marks their first collaboration with cinematographer Roger Deakins after regular DP Sonnenfeld left to pursue a directing career, and it is quite a leap from the stylish tones of Miller's Crossing to the controlled, washed out landscapes of Fargo. Just as impressive, but more understated, the sign of artists fully coming into their own and confident in the key ingredients of their product. The screenplay is a work of art, the verbal sparring and control of language beyond peer, and like the world's greatest orchestra, the cast perform this symphony to perfection. <br/><br/>Macy is hopelessly fascinating as the least capable man in human history, and Stormare and Buscemi team up as the weirdest kidnappers ever to grace the screen. People cannot seem to lavish enough praise on Frances McDormand, and it is true that she allows a beautiful character to blossom beyond expectations. The Coens' one concession to mainstream audiences - a likable, grounded protagonist - is one of the most original main characters in cinema.<br/><br/>Like all their films, it adds up to so much more than you might think upon first viewing, and serves as an ideal starting point to explore their work. A classic!"

Nothing in the writing, however, provided for genuine laughs (at least not to me). Compare this to other black comedies such as One Flew Over the Cuckoos's Nest or Dr. Strangelove, in which there are many funny lines and episodes amid the backdrop of dire and/or disturbing circumstances.

Otherwise don't waste your time. <br/><br/>While Fargo is the true story of what happens when some sick minds get together and do the wrong thing, there is nothing particularly new about this theme in true life or fiction.  And while Alfred Hichcock might have made a masterpiece of this story, Mr. Cohen, in his flat pan ""cinema vérité "" style makes it one hell of a bore. <br/><br/>Jerry Lungard (William Macy) plays an emotionless jerk that is in trouble and dreams up a dumb plot to try to get himself out of it. He convinces me that the real life Jerry Lungard was as boring an idiot as the movie character. He plays the part so well he is absolutely dull. (But then - it is vérité !). <br/><br/>Pregnant police chief investigator Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) plays a like character but with more style.

It's supposed to be about a blotched kidnapping of William Macy's wife, and one of the two men who did it is a psychopathic lunatic. To appease the females, and grab the large Nazi audience of the U.S., the director chose to contrive the plot so to kill any woman with hair darker than complete blonde. Women love movies that do this, since they like to imagine a world with less competition. And women usually make the choice of what movie to see in a household. The acting is horrid, too. They try to do the accent of Hoosiers and people further West, but real people enunciate much better. The accents are horrible, and show incompetence.

"slokes","3","4","11","31 August 2009"," Not A True Story...Just Very Depressing
","My lack of enjoyment for this much-beloved murder-comedy story may have something to do with the complete disconnect I get reading positive reviews posted here. They talk about its great humor, its strong sense of place, and the tough way it deals with bad things people really do.<br/><br/>I watch this movie and just feel miserable. Not so much with the story on screen, but with ""Fargo's"" enormous popularity.<br/><br/>Minnesota car salesman Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) needs a lot of money. He decides on a plan to have his wife kidnapped so that her wealthy father will pay a million-dollar ransom. He offers the kidnappers, a pair of lowlife goons, $40,000 by pretending its half of a much lower ransom demand. All this comes apart when one of the goons gets trigger-happy on their way back from the wife-snatching, and Chief Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) gets the call.<br/><br/>People liken the humor in ""Fargo"" to that of ""Goodfellas"", except in ""Goodfellas"" the people getting hurt and killed are guys who chose their ""kill-or-be-killed"" line of work. Here, the kidnapping and later deaths are treated as a kind of goof, to be larked over by Marge and the other cops. Tragedy becomes a kind of cynical shorthand for audience merriment. For example, the kidnapped mother's poor son is only glimpsed teary-eyed in one scene after the crime so the directors can make the point of his lame musical interests - Whitesnake and accordions.<br/><br/>The comedies of Joel and Ethan Coen often deal in broad caricature with a regional slant. ""Raising Arizona"" used the Southwest United States, ""O Brother Where Art Thou"" the Deep South; both to great effect. Yet here the depictions of the Northwestern people (Minnesota, not North Dakota, is the central setting; Dakotans may be grateful the Coens are not from there) border on the bovine. Big cow-faced people chew disgusting amounts of starches and red meat while talking in monosyllables about the weather and little else. ""Yah"", ""Yah betcha"", ""Doncha know"" and so on permeate their dialogue until the point of their basic moronity is hammered home.<br/><br/>One wonders if this is what makes the film comedic to so many: How could you care about people like this being murdered? They're barely alive now! I actually have less of a problem watching the murders - which to be fair to the Coens are not shot in an exploitative manner - than some of the casual dialogue scenes. The Coens as writers seem to enjoy creating one miserably painful conversation after another, using Larry David-style morbid embarrassment as its ultimate purpose, such as Marge's pointless meeting with an old high-school flame or Lundegaard getting the shaft from his too-nasty-to-be-true father-in-law.<br/><br/>""This could work out real well for me and Jean and Scottie"", Lundegaard tells the old man at one point, trying to sell him on a loan.<br/><br/>""Jean and Scottie never have to worry,"" the father-in-law growls.<br/><br/>To say this film is morally repulsive and insulting to Minnesotans is not to deny its funny or interesting in places, once you make an effort to accept where its coming from. Watching the lowlife crooks (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) argue about pancakes is kind of fun, and certain scenes work in a low-key way. The camera-work by Roger Deakins captures the grimness early American settlers talked so despondently about, where horizon lines are lost between whited-out land and sky.<br/><br/>But this 98-minute film with seven murders feels more to me like the Donner Party running on real time. I know people enjoy this film, but man I don't know if I'd feel worse knowing why."

","The movie had a great concept and it was actually written very well, but... I don't know if it was good acting or bad acting, but every character in this movie sickened me. Their behaviorisms, their speech, their rationale just drove me insane. Mr. Lundegard (William H. Macy) was a train wreck, the criminals he was dealing with were inept, his father-in-law was a boorish old bastard, his wife was just annoying, and the sheriff was a pregnant Columbo.<br/><br/>It's ideal to do a movie about a crime that goes horribly wrong due to lousy criminals, but make it a comedy or something. This was supposed to be the real deal crime drama type, but these people were so pathetic that I couldn't bear to watch them. And besides that, what possesses a sheepish, meek man like Lundegard to try to pull off such an extravagant crime like have his wife kidnapped? Though I couldn't stand it, somehow I stomached the movie. I forced myself to watch it like a child forcing down lima beans just so I could be fair in my critique. But what was worse than anything... what topped it all off... what was just the splinter under the fingernail, the nails on the chalk board, the reason for shoving screwdrivers in both ears...<br/><br/>THEIR ACCENTS!!! AAAAAH. I ABSOLUTELY HATED, ABHORED, DREADED, & LOATHED THEIR ACCENTS. Especially the wife. How can anyone who talks like that be taken seriously???

","The most ""blah"" of the Coen's films (At least The Big Lebowski had that hilariously bad musical number and Jeff Bridges).  Average in every way, except it was acted extremely well.  William Macy was especially good; Buscemi and Stormare were great.  Ms McDormand was competent, but hardly deserved a nomination, much less the award.  It's way too easy to play a caricature like that.  The script was predictable, which is very surprising for the Coens.

","Fargo is a movie that has an interesting story, it is a good movie, but also well directed with a snowy cinematography. There are outstanding actors such as Wlliam H. Macy, Peter Stormare, Steve Buscemi. There is also Frances Mc Dormand, another outstanding actress, even if she is so unsympathetic in this movie, she is usually cold anyway, but. If Fargo had been made after A Simple Plan, I would have said cliché or an imitation, but I can say that it was a pioneer. This is a crime movie, a bag full of money, two killers, a female cop and misfortunes. As said, a good movie, but no more than that. This is the problem. It is seen as one of the best movies of 1990s, some say it is the best Coen Brothers movie by far! Almost every Coen movie is compared with Fargo, so found disappointing, critics say that it was a masterpiece. This is the problem. The movie is good, but there is nothing that great in the movie. By the way, Fargo is not flawed, but I did not like the end. It was raw and too simple for such a movie. Honestly, I liked A Simple Plan more, even if it was inspired by Fargo and made later. Because it was stunning, but Fargo is not. At least it should not have been in IMDb Top 250."
"ackstasis","7","2","4","19 November 2007"," ""Blood has been shed, Jerry.""
","It's probably inevitable that, after hearing so much about its greatness, 'Fargo' proves something of a minor disappointment. After numerous critical successes {including their finest film to date, 'Miller's Crossing (1990)' and the Palme d'Or-winning 'Barton Fink (1991)'}, Joel and Ethan Coen apparently struck gold with 'Fargo (1996),' the ""true story"" of a kidnapping and murder in the icy wastelands of Minnesota. The film is a thematic retread of the brothers' debut picture, 'Blood Simple (1984)' {of which I was not overly-fond}, and explores how a seemingly-simple crime can escalate into the tragic and devastating destruction of innocent (and not-so-innocent) lives. The Coens would return once again to this popular theme with the accomplished film-noir, 'The Man Who Wasn't There (2001),' which is arguably one of their best efforts. 'Fargo' was the filmmakers' first real Oscar success, retrieving seven Academy Award nominations and two wins (Best Writing and Best Actress in a Leading Role {Francis McDormand}). However, the film's Best Picture chances were upset by Anthony Minghella's majestic wartime romance epic, 'The English Patient.'<br/><br/>In a dreary small-town region of the United States, where the road is perpetually covered in frost and a sheet of ice affixes itself to your car windscreen, money-troubled father Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) plots a simple, fool-proof method of acquiring funds. He hires two dubious-looking thugs (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) to kidnap his own wife (Kristin Rudrüd), in order to extort ransom money from his wealthy, domineering father-in-law (Wade Gustafson). However, things don't go quite to plan, and after the two low-life criminals murder a state trooper and two passing witnesses, local Brainerd Chief of Police Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) arrives to investigate. She, like almost every other character in the film, has the jovial disposition and exaggerated mannerisms of typical Midwestern small-town folk, discussing a triple-homicide as though somebody has just stolen a cookie from the jar, and making frequent use of such quaint phrases as ""You betcha,"" ""Aw Jeez,"" ""Okie-Dokie"" and ""Yah.""<br/><br/>The Coens have done a lot right with 'Fargo.' Their decision to blend a thrilling tale of deceit and murder with moments of satirical  almost slapstick  comedy creates a unique and interesting contrast that sets the film apart from most thrillers. William H. Macy is at his jittery best as a potential con-man so hopelessly inept that he can't call off the dangerous ruse because he never acquired the kidnappers' phone number. Steve Buscemi is, likewise, fantastic as Carl Showalter, a ""funny-looking"" weasel with a hot temper. Peter Stormare is suitably psychotic as the sullen but dangerous Gaear Grimsrud, even if his role just required him to remain silent and look creepy. Then we come to Frances McDormand (a.k.a. Mrs. Joel Coen), who, regardless of her talents as an actress, has annoyed me in every film in which I've seen her {which basically just covers 'Blood Simple,' 'Fargo' and 'The Man Who Wasn't There,' though to a lesser extent in the latter}.<br/><br/>I know that Marge Gunderson is supposed to be one of the Coen Brothers' most entertaining creations, but her character somehow seemed so pointless. We spend all our time following her lightweight attempts at an investigation, and yet all I cared about was the kidnapping and how Jerry was coping with it all. Perhaps to hide the fact that Marge has almost nothing to do, the Coens toss in a couple of extraneous, dead-end minor characters who serve no purpose other than to distract me from the more exciting segments of the story. All things considered, 'Fargo' is a solid, albeit flawed, thriller/comedy that is characteristic of the Coens in every respect. Allow me to reiterate that William H. Macy was absolutely phenomenal, and definitely gives the film's greatest performance, though I did think that his character gave himself away too easily. In the grand scheme of things, 'Fargo' could certainly scrape into the directors' top five films, though my hope is that their latest release, 'No Country For Old Men (2007),' will oust it from the list."

","Fargo is rightly named one of the best movies of the 90's. Featuring some outstanding performances, a great script and some beautiful cinematography.

He concocts a scheme to get more money to support a new project he is undertaking. Jerry hires two men (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wife so he can get his rich father in law (Harve Presnell) to pay the ransom of $1,000,000. Unfortunately things get way out of hand.<br/><br/>Fargo is a movie everyone needs to see. It is a mixture of many things. Crime, comedy, thriller, drama and romance. The screenplay is witty and packs many delights along the way. All the performances are perfect in this movie. The movies also is extremely true to life. The characters are not overdone or inhuman. Nothing seems unrealistic. If I were to name anything wrong with this movie it would be that it was too short. I really wanted it to continue on.<br/><br/>4½/5."

","It's pretty clear to me that you have to know a lot of the ins and outs of movies to enjoy a Coen brothers movie. But unfortunately if you don't your left bored and bemused. Now I can appreciate this movie has some top-notch acting. Not many will deny that, but there are a lot of movies out there with fine acting. So it needs something else which apparently this movie has, but as someone who just purely wants to be entertained and left thinking ""wow"", I was let down. Nothing shocked me, the ending didn't give me goosebumps etc. There were scenes (such as the one where the female cop talks to her old Asian friend from school) that I can't for the life of me work out why they needed to be there.<br/><br/>So if you've been to film school or just simply have good knowledge of how a movie should be then by all means check this out and enjoy, but otherwise I recommend you stay away."
"dhuey","Null","2","4","28 August 2005"," Why did Macy character need the $?
","I love this film. One thing it never reveals is why the Macy character badly needed so much cash in the first place. First, this need for cash leads to the fraud with GMAC Financing (early in the film), but then, of course, it leads to the series of events in the main plot of the film.<br/><br/>Anyone care to guess what the Macy character did to need so much cash, so quickly? We see no substance abuse or gambling tendencies. I'm stumped.<br/><br/>One minor gripe with the film: the ""true story"" bit. It isn't. I don't understand why the Coens would feel the need to make that up, but they did."
"yaseminturkish","6","2","4","16 April 2002"," An interesting look at mannerisms and speech in Fargo, North Dakota but will it be memorable 20 years from now?
","The first time I saw Fargo in 1996 I enjoyed it mainly because I was hoping that it would edge out the highly over-rated snorefest The English Patient at the Academy Awards.  Now I'm aware of the fact that Fargo is also highly over-rated.  Three generations of my family grew up in Minneapolis, Minnesota and Fargo, North Dakota.  The mannerisms and speech used by William H Macy and Frances McDormand is realistic but why should I remember this screenplay twenty years from now?  Apparently it is a true story which must have all the fans of Survivor running for their local Blockbuster stores along with the fans of America's Most Wanted and Cops.  When I want to see reality that will impact me for years to come I'll rent something historically significant like Malcolm X or a documentary film like No Man's Land or One Day in September.  These movies are by the books as reality movies should be and don't look for black comedy that offends the memories of the people who were most closely affected by the tragedy.<br/><br/>  I did appreciate the effort on the part of the Coen brothers to add their usual wit to the mix.  William H Macy was hilarious as the father and husband who was more worried about money than about the lives of his family. It was a somewhat enchanting experience to watch him try to keep everything under control while slightly breaking down with every passing moment. Frances McDormand has proven herself to be talented in Almost Famous and The Man who Wasn't There but she is highly over-rated here.  Perhaps it's my bias that was putting all bets on Emily Watson's extraordinary performance in Breaking the Waves for the Academy Award.  For me McDormand was adequate and appeared to be having fun but not memorable 20 years down the road.  The always reliable Steve Buscemi (he should have won for Ghost World) stole the show here.<br/><br/>   Fargo is a film that I'd recommend to the reality-television audience and to serious fans of the Coen brothers films.  It enchants on some level but may disgust some viewers who will be perplexed that this really did happen. It suffices as a rental on a Saturday night when you want to see what all the fuss is about.  Be prepared however, if your from Fargo or Minnesota to be somewhat offended.  After all, when you see Frances McDormand, you'll be looking in the mirror.<br/><br/>6/10"

","Ethan and Joel Coen are at it again. Their masterful directing and writing makes this movie unforgettable. Snowy North Dakota sets the mood real well for this maliciously funny story of a botched kidnapping. William Macy is a car salesman in the need of some big bucks. He hires two inept scum buckets (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare)to kidnap his wife thus letting him cash in on a huge ransom to be paid by his father-in-law. Frances McDormand plays a pregnant police chief that takes charge of picking up the pieces of the crime that has come unraveled.<br/><br/>Strong violence and foul language go hand in hand with the awkward and hilarious situations. You will certainly be eager to watch this one again immediately."
"pied","5","2","4","29 October 1998"," Technically superb, but ultimately depressing satire.
","FARGO is satirizing a kidnapping, a murder, and North Dakota, not necessarily in that order.

He hopes to collect the reward money from his worried father-in-law and get himself out of debt.<br/><br/>FARGO is depressing because this story is based upon a very real tragedy and the details of this event are anything but funny.  I was left with an empty feeling after seeing this film."

","What I liked: It's quite a moral study. The main thing I got from it was that actions have consequences and you're rewarded in life by the way you treat others. The Coen's have a really great understanding and control of their characters. I found it entertaining throughout and any film that is 1hr30 long is a great film in my book. I love Frances McDormand in this and just in general I think she's a great actress. I also love how the North Dakotan setting was one of the main characters.<br/><br/>What I disliked: I didn't really find it particularly complex or studiable (i think i made that word up). I also understand it's supposed to be a black comedy but I really didn't find it funny, I think maybe the fact they're so nice and have funny accents is supposed to be the funny part but maybe that would be more effective if I knew anything/ cared about people from the Midwest. I'm not marking down Fargo for this but I think three bilboards outside Ebbing Missouri is largely inspired by this film but does a much better job at studying morality and the consequences of our actions."

","At the beginning of the old silly, really thought it was a true story adapted. After looking at the reviews, I found that it was not. What's more, a Japanese woman was frozen to death after she climbed mountains and mountains in search of the treasure in the movie.
I completely fainted. Don't normal people have the ability to distinguish between true and false? It reminds me of the news many years ago that some writer wrote a book with a telephone number as its title. Result the actual host of this telephone number receives n many telephone everyday, accuse author tort blablabla later.<br/><br/>Going back to the movie, it looks like that's all there is to it. But read aftertaste but more and more feel to have a look, good classic black humor. It's hard to guard against the unexpected. Everyone has a role to play.
That stupid son-in-law came up with such a bad idea that his family was ruined.
That rich father-in-law, snobbish selfishness, the result oneself commit a sin, be collapsed.
The short man, greedy and unsatisfied with a million dollars, was killed by his accomplices.
The tall, impulsive, violent man was finally taken care of by a pregnant policewoman.<br/><br/>I like the policewoman very much, or I should say the way she lives. Always be organized, logical, and logical. Work is also very principled, met that mental illness classmate, both very serious not to cross the line, but will tease to dissolve the awkward atmosphere, you can see that she has always smooth smart way of doing things.
The most important thing is her relationship with her husband. The husband is honest and considerate, in the early morning when she receives a phone call to go out of the police without a complaint, but also insisted on getting up together to make breakfast for his wife, is really envy others. And the wife also is really a good wife, go out to do business also does not forget to buy earthworms to go fishing for the husband.
They encourage each other, support, light but super warm, let me almost in this flat in the dead.<br/><br/>Finally, they snuggled together and watched TV. The husband said his painting was used on a three-cent stamp, while one of his peers was used on a 29-cent stamp. ""Someone is going to need the three-cent stamp,"" she said. ""I'm so proud of you.""
The husband hugged her and said, I love you. ""I love you, too,"" she said.

","The runaway and ""cold"" that the Cohen brothers want are in place
The protagonist's motivation is a little problem. He is obviously a man suffering from society. How can his IQ keep up with the kidnapping of Chinese elementary school students who played a self-directed kidnapping. Fortunately, the IQ is consistent and the hairstyle and performance are very small.
It is out of control rather than accident because of the difference in expression. The difference between ""accident"" and ""out of control"" is reflected in the degree of control. It's an accident that the bird droppings hit you on the head. After the same thing happened several times, you decided to prank your friends, but it hit you on the head again. This is out of control.
The angle of the Cohen brothers is mainly based on the role, and the natural loss of control is a more accurate description. The accident in the ""Death is Here"" series has reached such an extent that you can feel that it is nothing to do with design and accident. In the end, I just want to see how the character dies instead of ""Ah, life is really precious, I want to live a good life."" ""Blood Storm"" does not have such a strong sense of artificial design, naturally you can start to sigh the greatness or ordinaryness of life.
""cold""
""Aha"" and too many seemingly embarrassing and alienating scenes are not actually to make you feel humorous or bored, but to make you feel as cold as the ice and snow outside the window, and the relationship is cold. The relationship of all the characters does not involve the emotions we think of in nature but is external, including the ending, the sudden warmth, which does not dispel the coldness, at most it can be warmer than drilling.
Whether life is dominated or designed is not a question that the movie can answer."

","Desperate nebbish Jerry Lundegaard (an excellent William H.

'Fargo' is one in a long list of superlative films produced and directed by the Coen brothers. The film is a dark, almost farcical, comedy with offbeat characters, an excellent sense of place (flat, wide, cold, and bleak), and the famous over-the-top Minnesota accents, especially from Academy Award winner Frances McDormand (""You betcha!""). The clever plot is a cautionary tale about just how hard pulling off a complex crime would be (unlike most 'caper films', few people in 'Fargo' respond as they were expected to) and the psychological strangulation as the noose tightens around Jerry is palpable. McDormand's 'Marge Gunderson', a heavily pregnant, always hungry, Minnesota cop investigating the increasingly bloody kidnapping is outstanding: perfectly blending the character's disarming 'Minnesota-nice' personality with her competence as an investigator.

","Fargo is a hilarious depiction of my home state and it's people. Some characters accents I thought, were very exaggerated but if you're not from there you wouldn't know that, (so they needed to be). William H. Macy does a phenomenal job balancing the accent with tone, he gives a frantic performance that is true to his character and is honestly from an acting standpoint VERY hard to juggle. Apart from the stories dark nature, a lot is shown in its lightest moments, it is a fine line between comedy and tragedy and the Coen brothers rode it the whole way. One characteristic that makes this film stand out to me is it's ability to let dialogue alone carry a scene, I'm a huge advocate for less bells and whistles and more interesting conversations. A particular scene in which this is illustrated is when Steve Buscemi's character is cussing out his partner for being silent in the car. A. It's a long take and B. His lines are stagnant and choppy. This allows the viewer to experience his frustrations in real time, something that a lot of films tend to scrape out.

","How far do I have to go to watch brilliant cinema?
Fargo, the 1996 film from the Cohen Brothers' is lauded as the magnum opus of their cinematic work up to that point.<br/><br/>I disagree with the assessment at the time of many observers. Mildly entertaining black comedy interwoven with several murders and a criminal plot by a financially struggling car dealer Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy).<br/><br/>The locations of North Dakota and Minnesota make for a snowy backdrop that is perfectly lensed by cinematographer Roger Deakins.<br/><br/>Contrasted with the dripping blood of murder victims and hapless criminals led by Carl Showalter (Steve Buscemi) and Peter Stormare (Gaear Grimsrud).<br/><br/>The one shining light of this film is the performance of Frances McDormand as pregnant police officer Marge Gunderson.<br/><br/>Gunderson pieces together the hapless criminality of the other characters in kidnapping the wife of Lundegaard in order for her rich father to hopefully pay out a ransom that supposedly will be used to pay off the criminals and Jerry Lundegaard at the same time.<br/><br/>A pretty short runtime doesn't allow any boredom to set in. The black comedy of the hapless crooks and their associates. The Scandinavian derived accent of the locals can be mildly entertaining or annoying!<br/><br/>The characters are pretty geeky in their dialogue. Steve Buscemi is Steve Buscemi."

","Brilliant. The film's idiosyncratic characters, with their northern Minnesota accents and mannerisms, are truly memorable and infinitely quotable. Frances McDormand, William H. Macy, and Steve Buscemi are all in career roles, and the supporting cast (including the chilling Peter Stormare) are great too. The cinematography is excellent and I loved the shots on location, which brought back memories; it's striking and makes the film feel authentic. The pace of the film, it's story-telling, dry humor, little observations, and surprise moments all make it highly entertaining even after repeat watches. Gotta love Marge Gunderson (McDormand) too - in her simple and nice way, she's canny, persistent, sensitive, and brave. She does it all, pursuing killers, carrying a baby, tactfully fending off an old high school classmate's advances, and stroking her husband's ego in what is a lovely marriage. What a bright character she is for such a dark tale. Just beware that it's not a true story, despite what that silly opening title card says, which was one of the film's few mistakes."

Follwing a vagurly sinister beginning, the plot gets way and it is a crazy one, crazy like Raising Arizona and the Big Lebowski.

He needs some cash so hires a couple low level criminals Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare to kidnap his wife for a ransom that he's sure his father in law will pay. Macy's Father in Law is rich so he sees it as a victimless crime. Of course thing don't go as planned as people die so enter the pregnant detective Marge Gunderson to investigate. Marge is brilliantly played by Frances McDormand.

","In wintery Minnesota, Jerry (William H. Macy) has big problems of his own making. Secretly deep in debt, he has few options, although he is married to the daughter of a very rich man, Wade (Harve Pressnell) and works as the manager of his father in law's car dealership. Wade dislikes Jerry, you see. Desperate, he turns to two seedy characters in Fargo, recommended by an auto mechanic, to kidnap his wife, forcing Wade to pay up. The trio will split the proceeds. One of the would-be nappers, Carl (Steve Buscemi) is a non-stop talker with a loose cannon. The other (Peter Stormare) is a blonde menacing giant who says hardly anything. A car from Wade's lot will be the operation vehicle. Almost immediately, there are problems. Huge ones. A highway patrolman pulls the vehicle over, as it still have dealership plates. As Carl starts to reason with the officer, the giant shoots the cop. They drag his body to a ditch. Not only this, a young couple sees the crime from their car and a high speed pursuit ends in their deaths, also. Now, a small city police officer, Marge (Frances McDormand), six months pregnant, must find the perps for these deaths while Wade, frantic, tries to negotiate for the life of his beloved daughter. Meanwhile, Jerry sinks deeper and deeper into lies and deceit. Despite Marge's pregnancy and small town roots, can she solve these crimes? This tantalizing film has a superb plot, careful direction, and an eye and ear for snowy venues and upper Midwest conversation. In addition, the cast is fabulous, with Macy, Mcdormand, Buscemi, Stormare, and all others pulling off performances of great power. Don't forgo Fargo, even though it has some rough violence. The film's magnitude is richly deserved."

","Having seen this film some years ago I used to think it was really good. I watched it again last night, and decided it was actually pretty messy and nasty. Nearly all the characters, with Marge and the bit parts excepted, are unusually unpleasant. The Coens seem not to have enjoyed growing up in Scandinavian America, and have taken revenge on the place. Is it populated almost entirely by dolts, scammers, thugs, bullies, hookers, wimps and so on ? According to the extra feature ""Minnesota Nice"" there is an underlying feeling that ""polite cultures are the most repressed and therefore the most violent"". The Coens put it that way, in any case. In other respects the whole set-up reminded me a little of Blue Velvet country, ten years earlier.<br/><br/>The film kicks off with three unplanned killings of innocent people, and then adds to these with three or four more. It would spoil things were I to list them. Marge, who is a pregnant policewoman, then forces a solution to what is going on and arrests the surviving guilty party. She tells him it's a beautiful day. It isn't in fact, since it's foggy and snowy. She ends up in bed with her signally lumpy husband, and tells him he's wonderful. The two of them spend a lot of time stuffing their mouths. There is a curious incident with a mentally disturbed Japanese man. I don't quite know what that's about. The net result is faintly comic, in an ugly sort of way, if you think all the deaths are funny. $1 million, less $80,000, is buried and lost in the snow."

","Review: 'Fargo' Another film by the Coen brothers, Fargo, starring William H. Macy, Frances McDormand, Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare, is about a man in financial problems who devises to hire men to kidnap his wife so his wealthy father in law will pay for her release and in turn pay off his debt. Fargo is a crime, drama and a thriller. It was released in 1996. To be completely honest I didn't really like this film I had seen 'The Big Lebowski' before going into this film and just had such high hopes. I thought 'The Big Lebowski' was far superior. Although I thought that having Steve Buscemi as a major character was better than how he is in 'The Big Lebowski' with him only having a couple of lines, even still he was very funny in 'The Big Lebowski'. His performance as Carl is very good. He plays a very violent, crazy guy. His partner in crime Gaear played by Peter Stormare is also portrayed very well and its actually quite funny watching him grimace at the violence of Buscemi's character. One of the reasons I thought 'The Big Lebowski' is better is because I thought it was far funnier. In 'Fargo' I felt that too many times the comedy was centred on the characters accents. It was funny the first time but it got old quick. Especially for Frances McDormand's character I felt that most of the humour was just the accent. Apart from one scene I didn't really like her character. When she is interviewing one of the criminals and he drives off and she exclaims 'oh for Pete's sake, he's fleein' the interview' I thought that was her standout scene to be honest. I thought she over did the 'Yas' throughout the film. I especially found it hard to relate to her and sympathize with her. I felt the overuse of the accent again was the cause of that. I think the jokes with the accent went over my head because I've never been to Minnesota. One thing that really worked for me was the visuals. For me the setting is the reason for this. The snow really makes everything look great. The contrast between the dark clothes of the characters and the snow looked really good. I think the most iconic thing for me is the scene where the car drives past the statue of the lumberjack. This for some reason just really stuck out in my mind. Whenever I think of Fargo I think of that statue. In conclusion the story is decent, Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare are excellent along with William H. Macy. Frances McDormand is a bit hit and miss as well as most of the humour in the film. In the end, I give it a 6/10. I found it very hard to like it especially in comparison with 'The Big Lebowski'."

","My brief encounter with the Coen brothers has been reminiscent of a roller coaster. I loathed The Big Lebowski but quite enjoyed Barton Fink. Fargo has given me the inspiration I've been lacking to deepen my relationship with their films. The 1996 crime drama was a fun descent into their take on a ""true crime"" story. Weaving the tale of an inept crime organizer, trying to make his wife better by having his wife kidnapped for ransom money paid by his father-in-law, Fargo captures what it means to live in a town small enough to induce claustrophobia, and how suffocating an unfulfilled life truly is. Starring William H. Macy, Steve Buscemi, and Frances McDormand, Fargo remains an audience favorite from the Coen brothers even 20 years after its release.<br/><br/>Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) is a car salesman, working at his father-in-law, Wade Gustafson's (Harve Presnell) dealership, unhappy with his current situation. He has an idea for an investment that he believes his wealthy father-in-law, who doesn't much care for him, will be willing to invest in. Jerry painstakingly goes over all the particulars of the deal with Wade only to be shut out when Wade decides to take the investment on with a partner, rather than give Jerry the initial capital to get it started himself. Devastated and humiliated, Jerry hatches a plan to have his wife kidnapped. It will all work, Jerry believes, by requesting in ransom more than will be used to pay off the captors, leaving Jerry the remaining money to invest how he pleases. The operation should be easy enough and will avoid all the ""messy stuff"" because Jerry is able to get the names of a couple people that will pull the kidnapping off from a man he works with at the dealership. Everything is going to plan until Wade refuses to let Jerry handle any of the particulars, vowing to take over the money exchange himself. Jerry's entire life begins to unwind with that decision as he finds himself in an even graver decision than he was before. <br/><br/>On a personal note, it was fun to see William H. Macy and Steve Buscemi in a film together, as I spent a majority of my youth confusing the two actors with the other ( I don't know how, by the way). I spent most of the movie in complete awe of the way it was shot. Great emphasis is paid to mise-en-scene, throughout the film feeling quite claustrophobic when needed, and isolating when the script calls for it. As it turns out, despite the title card in the beginning of the film, not much in the Coen brother's Fargo is actually a true crime story, but as they noted, ""you don't need a true crime to have a true crime story."""

The 7-month pregnant Sheriff of Brainerd, Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand), is soon on the case, and she is very intuitive and resourceful...<br/><br/>An amazing story, well told. Written and directed by Joel and Ethan Coen, the story itself shows how the most simple, very-limited-harm- intended crime can unravel, resulting in the deaths of several people.<br/><br/>The execution is a work of pure art. The Coens mix incredibly dark plot lines and themes with a lightness and almost frivolity to produce a movie that is simultaneously deadly serious and very funny. There is violence aplenty and some quite disturbing scenes, mixed with folksiness, innocence and humour. In the midst of evil there is good, and vice versa.<br/><br/>A haunting score and stunning cinematography add to the tone of the movie.<br/><br/>Superb performance by Frances McDormand in the lead role. The Sheriff is an amazing character, an understated, modest hero, and McDormand nails the part.

","""Raising Arizona"" filmmakers Joel and Ethan Coen have surpassed themselves again with their idiosyncratic dramedy thriller ""Fargo"" about a gallery of memorable characters. A pregnant female police chief investigates a strange kidnapping case and tracks down a pair of ruthless killers and the Minneapolis automobile salesman who hired them. He learns about these two reprobates from a mechanic at the car dealership where he works. Like all first-class Coen brothers' movies, this police procedural operates on two levels and boasts not only eccentric characters but also outlandish predicaments. The use of an unlikely lady police chief, Frances McDormand, who stands in for the standard-issue male protagonist, sets this superior, often satirical crime saga apart from most entries in the genre. Incidentally, McDormand took home an Oscar for Best Actress as Marge Gunderson. Furthermore, the Coens shared the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen. Although it won only two Oscars, ""Fargo"" received nominations for Best Picture, Best Picture, Best Cinematography, and Best Editing."" ""Fargo"" unfolds with an amusing preamble: ""THIS IS A TRUE STORY. The events depicted in this film took place in Minnesota in 1987. At the request of the survivors, the names have been changed. Out of respect for the dead, the rest has been told exactly as it occurred."" Of course, most of what happens here is strictly illusory. Like most Hollywood movies, ""Fargo"" is a synthesis of the real and the imaginary. In the article ""Rewind: What Part Of 'Based On' Don't You Understand?"" author Karl Heitmueller wrote: ""Joel Cohen told 'Time Out' that 'if an audience believes that something's based on a real event, it gives you permission to do things they might otherwise not accept.'"" Heitmueller classifies ""Fargo"" and other movies, like ""Ray"" and ""Gangs of New York"" as BOATS movies. According to Heitmueller, ""A BOATS movie is not a documentary, and while watching one we should be smart enough to take everything we see in it with a big ol' grain of popcorn salt. The problem seems to be that audiences often overlook the words ""based on."" It's not Hollywood's fault that, amazingly, many people just don't question what's presented in a BOATS movie — that moviegoers don't stop to consider that it's impossible to know exactly what happened on the doomed fishing boat the Andrea Gale in ""The Perfect Storm."" The contrived plot involves a cash starved car salesman, Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macey of ""The Cooler""), who hires a couple of lowlife criminals, Carl Showalter (Steve Buscemi of ""Con-Air"") and Gaear Grimsrud (Peter Stormare of ""The Big Lebowski"") to kidnap his ditzy wife, Jean Lundegaard (Kristin Rudrüd of ""Drop Dead Gorgeous""), whose kidnapping scene is hilarious. Jean gets wrapped up in a shower curtain and scrambles about her house in desperation to escape them. Meantime, Jerry hopes that he can force his gruff father-in-law, Wade Gustafson (Harve Presnell of ""Saving Private Ryan""), who owns the car dealership where Jerry works, to pay the ransom. The father-in-law isn't happy about the arrangement. He would rather hand over the loot to the kidnappers than entrust Jerry with the cash. Indeed, scheming Jerry plans to split the loot between the three of them. Ultimately, Marge investigates, tracking down leads, and questions Jerry. Naturally, everything turns into a comedy of errors, and nothing works out for either the desperate car salesman or his paid abductors. Marge proves that he is no pushover when he wields her service revolver. She drops Garear in his tracks when he tries to run from her. Ace British lenser Roger Deakins' cinematography is a pleasure to behold, and he captures the grim setting of North Dakota with its snow-swept terrain. Some of the violence is brutal. When the two kidnappers are pulled over by a state trooper, Gaear shoots him in the head and blood bubbles out of his head like a fountain. The dry dialogue that everybody delivers is interesting, too. ""Fargo"" has thus far spawned two made-for-television shows just as bogus as the movie ""Fargo."" Produced for $7 million, this Coen brothers release generated over $60 million at the box office, making it a fabulously successful movie."

","Believe it or not I finally got around to watching this movie last night at a midnight movie showing at a local movie theater. I knew going in it was a Coen bros. film, set somewhere up north, that starred Steve Buscemi. Other than that I had no clue about the plot or other characters, or the Oscar wins and high ratings on this site. That being said, this is a good dark comedy, a little on the violent side in some parts, but very well done. CONTAINS SPOILERS The movie is set in a bone-chilling, Minnesota/North Dakota, in the late 1980's, supposedly based on a true story. It is about Jerry Lundergan(William H. Macy), a weaselly car salesman that is having money problems(that is never really explained), who comes up with a plan to have his wife kidnapped and for his wealthy father-in-law to pay the ransom, with most of the money actually going to him. Once the plan is in motion, very little goes right and quite a bit of blood, mayhem and comedy occur. The atmosphere and screen shots are what I liked most about this film. The Coen's did a wonderful job of making you feel the cold and wilderness of the upper Midwest. The camera work was stunning and IMO is what really makes this movie great. The plot itself is good, a little slow at first, but really ramps up as the movie goes on. It is a dark comedy, with humor peppered in just the right amount. Some of the characters are over-the-top with heavy mid-western accents, some are just plain over-the-top. My only beef with the movie is the blood and violence. I think they could have made this movie just as good without the gore. I also think some of the character development was a little rushed, with a few characters adding very little to the story or plot. Overall a beautifully filmed dark comedy, and a must see! 7/10"
"Screen_Blitz","9","0","0","8 February 2016"," An amazing achievement by the Coen brothers
","This dark comedy based on real-life events is the movie that defined the Coen brothers as the influential filmmakers they are today. With their incredible writings and their wittiness of genre-mixing, these two have made one of the most recognizable names in Hollywood. set in the snowy town of Fargo, North Dakota, this film stars William H. Macy as Jerry Lundegaard, a car dealer obsessed with being wealthy who hires a duo of ruthless criminals Carl Showalter (played by Steve Buscemi) and Gaear Grismud (played by Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wife Jean and exchange her for a large amount of money by her father. Before too long when the plan goes terribly wrong and turns into a bloodbath, this heinous crime gains the attention of a pregnant police officer Margo Gunderson (played by Frances McDormand) who comes into investigation. What comes from this crime story is some amazing performances by a talent cast, a polished screenplay, and some of the most elegantly written characters ever put to screen.<br/><br/>As this is a Coen brothers film, instead of conveying a straight dark tone, this film illustrates a dark and gritty story with a touch of humor sprinkled throughout its story. And with no little surprise, the Coen brothers achieve this quite well. From the opening scene, we are introduced to William H. Macy's character who is quickly learn is up to no good, and does compelling job at hiding his mischievousness from his wife and son. Nearly every scene of his presence is unpredictable and leaves you attention glued to him. Macy really stands out in this role and makes himself a good name for playing such a despicable husband and father his character is. The real fun however, occurs during the scenes of the two criminals played by Steve Buscemi and Peter Stomare, from the scene of kidnapping the main character's wife to the astonishing climax at the end. The story grows increasingly engaging and dark in the amidst of it's satirical tone, and every scene these two are in hits the right notes, whether they make you laugh or have you shocked to the edge of your seat. These two give such dazzling performances, especially Steve Buscemi who fits just right in his character considering his role he portrayed in Quentin Tarantino's 'Reservoir Dogs'. While these actors nail their roles, the biggest icing on the cake comes from Frances McDormand who gives a strong performance as the pregnant officer who goes on investigation of the crime. Standing as the most charismatic character, McDormand embraces her role diligently and never disappoints. It is no surprise her performance landed her an Academy Award.<br/><br/>Fargo is a fun and entertaining experience, and the Coen brothers do a tremendous job. This a film with amazing performances, a spectacular screenplay, and well developed characters that stand strong. It is definitely one of the best works by the Coen brothers, and something every movie fanatic shouldn't miss. I am so ready to see their next film 'Hail Caeser!' as it now out in theaters this week."

","Fargo is one of the more entertaining movies I think I've ever watched. It's engaging, clever and down right hilarious at times. William H. Macy plays Jerry Lundegaard, a family man and car salesman, with a few schemes up his sleeve. The main being, to have his wife kidnapped so that her wealthy father pays the ransom, where he will pocket half. Along the way he teams up with Carl and Gaear, two of the most hilariously incompetent movie ""bad guys"" in history. When the plan goes sour Jerry tries desperately to stay out of trouble's way.<br/><br/>The best part of Fargo, is the dark comedy aspect. In part, the movie is a satire of small town life. The irony is that even in the midst of a triple murder / kidnapping investigation, everyone remains so kind and polite, along with a very funny parody of Minnesota accents, and the gut-busting continuous description of Steve Buscemi being ""funny looking"".<br/><br/>Comedy aside, the Coens, as always, wrote some very impressive symbolism into their screenplay. The first, being the concept that Marge Grunderson, the police chief, is pregnant. This is meant to show that even a pregnant woman, in a small, snow covered town, can't avoid some of the evils of the world. The second example is the side plot with Mike Yanagita. At dinner, Marge believes and fully trusts everything that Mike says only to learn that it was all a lie. The viewer is supposed to learn that maybe Marge is just a little too trusting of people. With that information, Marge goes back to the dealership and confronts Jerry again after she believes that he was lying (which he was). This character development at such a late stage of the movie, is unique but in this case, it works fantastically.<br/><br/>On sheer watch and enjoy-ability, Fargo is a home run. When you work in the deeper level dark comedy and incredible symbolism that the Coen brothers have made famous, you have one of the best movies of the 1990s."

","An inept car salesman hires two thugs to kidnap his wife in order to get money from his rich father-in-law. Unfortunately he should have hired better thugs as they end up messing the whole thing up, which in turn causes the local law enforcement to become involved. From that setting we get a crime story worthy of being directed by the Coen brothers, full of awkward characters, everyday situations and hilariously dark scenes of blood, gore and rage.<br/><br/>The two thugs, played by Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare, are what make this film work for me. Usually cinema tends to depict criminals as violent and lethal people, and these two are that as well, but usually these kinds of characters are not depicted to be quite so out of their depth. It is made clear very soon that while these two may have done these kinds of things before, neither is what you'd call the sharpest knife in the drawer. And they're both so idiotic in their own ways. It's fascinating to watch them live their miserable criminal lives and utterly failing at it. And yet they remain threatening throughout the entire film. Not because they're criminal masterminds, but because they're morons with no moral inhibitions.<br/><br/>William H. Macy as Jerry Lundegaard, the car salesman, is also a fun character, who contrasts nicely with the two thugs. He's attempting to become a criminal, but he's even worse at it than his associates and every scene where he needs to pull off any kind conviction about his innocence is absolutely hilarious because well, you can guess.<br/><br/>Frances McDormand as Marge Gunderson, the Minnesotan police chief in charge of investigations, has also received a lot of praise for her work. Personally I found her to be a touch boring, though I do admit that my expectations we're a bit too high. She's just so utterly chipper and optimistic all the time that it seems unrealistic. It's a nice contrast to her opponents, but it still means that I didn't find her that interesting. Still, I do like her character on a conceptual basis, and the performance itself is objectively fine. Not just my personal cup of tea.<br/><br/>All in all Fargo is a nice watch if you're into dark comedy and can laugh at people being dismembered and people giving into their nefarious impulses. If you've liked any of the other Coen films, you're going to like this one as well."

","I watched this movie 2 years ago and found it to be plain dry and just ordinary. But after watching a couple of episodes from that masterfully done TV series by the same name, my interest in the movie was rekindled.<br/><br/>Today, after two years, I watched it again and found the movie to be surprisingly marvelous. <br/><br/>All the scenes that I found unfunny became one of the most expertly directed and written humorous scenes. <br/><br/>The casting (from main to extra characters) is superbly done. The humor is spot on - just the right amount slapstick and dark. Art direction is wonderful and dark. <br/><br/>Every element related to the film feels carefully thought and is executed with equal parts creativity and restraint. <br/><br/>I guess one just needs to be a little bit mature in movie-watching to fully enjoy Coen Brothers.<br/><br/>Another movie of them - The Big Lebowski was a big disappointment for me. I hate it from my core and have promised myself never to watch it again. But with my changed experience of Fargo, I think I might give it another chance as well. <br/><br/>Do watch Fargo after watching a couple of art houses."

","This movie put two things on the map: Fargo, North Dakota, and the Coen Brothers.<br/><br/>The city has been around since 1871, and has a fairly interesting history (feel free to Wikipedia it), yet is best known for film that was made in 1996. Pretty sad, actually. You want to have some fun? Type in Fargo to Google and see what comes up. If your experience is anything like mine, then you will see first articles about the newish (and apparently very good; I should check it out) TV show, then the movie, and only third the actual city.<br/><br/>The Coens have a fairly similar tale, though they are by now far more well-known across American than Fargo the city. Because it was their breakthrough into popular culture (and earned them their first Oscar), it was many a film-goer's introduction to them. As such, there are a fair amount of people who think that this is their first feature film when it is in reality their fourth.<br/><br/>But enough posturing and preparing. Why did I give this film a perfect score? What specifically makes it so captivating? Why is it regarded as one of the greatest films of the nineties. Well, in one sentence, it seamlessly blends comedy and drama without missing a beat, delivering a film as thought-provoking as it is entertaining, as likable as it is nihilistic, as beautiful as it is gritty.<br/><br/>I think if the Rotten Tomatoes review recap were a little more artsy, it would sound something like that.<br/><br/>In 1987, a car insurance salesman, played nicely by William H. Macy, is desperate for money. A lot of money. So he arranges for his wife to be kidnapped by some random criminals in return for 80K and a new car. He will then tell his wealthy father-in-law (who owns the chain of car dealerships) about this, say the criminals want a million in ransom, give them the 80K, and take 920K for himself, so he can start his own operation and start making money his way.<br/><br/>Now, if he were competent, this would have been a totally different movie. But he's not. No one is in this film. From the time you learn that he's a used car salesman, he feel almost a sort of pity towards him. He bungles around and sees everything crashing down on him, and there is nothing he can do about it. I won't spoil the ending, but it does not end well for him, or for any of the characters.<br/><br/>There is nothing more powerful than a comedy-drama done right. Neither contemporary film critics nor general audiences usually like them at first, but history gives them windfall.<br/><br/>Just because there is darkness does not mean that the movie has to be miserable. Thinking otherwise is how you get (relative) tripe like The Pianist or The English Patient while some of the greatest films of all time, like Leon: The Professional, a film I was reminded of more than a few times during my viewing of this, are shut out.<br/><br/>But of course, Leon, while it has a more vivid, more adventurous tone than one would expect for its subject matter, is not a comedy. This is. We throw the phrase 'dramedy' around a lot to describe a series or movie or game that has a lot of comedic and dramatic moments. But that phrase has never seen more apt than it is here. This film is not just a comedy and a drama, it is a full fledged combination of the two. And it is beautiful to behold. The drama makes the comedy better and the comedy makes the drama better. This approach is hard to pull off, but when it works, oh it works. And it never works has well as it does here.<br/><br/>A major theme in this film is imperfection. Think back to the title: they are in the far north, not the bright lights of NYC and Los Angeles. This motif is everywhere if you look for it, particularly in the characters. No one in this film is that confident or assured or smart. They are tragic characters, but not in the sweeping, cinematic sort of way, or even in the way we like to see reality portrayed. Rather, they are clumsy and awkward and angry; but not in an absolute way; they have some good in them too. Even one of the villains does something surprisingly selfless.<br/><br/>At the start, we are told that this is a true story, but at the end, we are told that it is not. Right there is the confusion and sense of hollowness that the Coens make so much use of here. Risky conniving and strategy are cool when they are done well, but are tragic for most others, for most of us. And after all our quests and ventures, it so often is empty and worthless, which us all dying. It doesn't lull on it like dramatic films can, but rather weaves it into the dark comedy, which makes it all the more poignant.<br/><br/>I do not like this film quite as much as No Country for Old Men, but it is a thoughtful, dark, masterfully-written, stunningly-shot, radiantly-scored film that you would be doing yourself a disservice to not see. You will not realize how invested in you are until half the film is already over."

","Film take place in the town after which it's named. At the outset we meet with Jerry (William H. Macy), a car salesman who has a meeting with criminals Grimsrud (Peter Stormare) and Charles (Steve Buscemi). Jerry is in big financial problems and decides to carry out the kidnapping of his own wife in order to extract ransom money from his wife's father. Criminals help him, but from the very beginning of things fall out of control. Followed by a series of unexpected events that will lead to fatal consequences, the team is chased by Marge (Frances McDormand), persistent local police officer. Cohen Brothers are specific for many reasons and bases their admirers from year to year increasing. Their films do not feature special effects, chases and a waste of money during the filming, but the subtle art that is best reflected in the superb directing and original screenplay full of extremely interesting and different characters. Most of the projects are signed to earn a solid sum of the cinema ticket offices, but they prefer to be their bosses, without conditions and interference in the work, which is typical for a big Hollywood studios, which often kill authorial innovation."

","Haven't seen the movie in a long time. I don't consider it a masterpiece like many others, but I think it's a great movie. ""Low-key"" is the keyword (no pun intended) in this movie: Score, Peter Stormare's character, John Carroll Lynch's character (Norm) and his relationship with Marge. All make the movie great.<br/><br/>Wonderful atmosphere (combination of location, score, cinematography and direction), great cast and direction.<br/><br/>John Carroll Lynch's character (Norm) and his relationship with his wife. It's so innocent, loyal, natural and low-key. I also love Peter Stormare's character. Again, low-key with minimum dialog. He's one of the main villains, but looks so innocent - like a kid at times. He's intimidating by NOT talking and just giving a blank look.<br/><br/>Frances McDormand is very good in her role, but IMO it's not worthy of an Oscar. Definitely not for ""Lead Role""."

","Fargo is an odd film if you don't know exactly what you are watching before you start. Last year, I watched this movie with my parents, who thought the movie in fact WAS based on a true story, and it was a drama, in the same region as Zodiac. For those that have watched the movie, this is obviously the worst possible way you could watch this movie.<br/><br/>Fargo is a comedy in every form, but also a cold (literally) crime tale with a warm centre in the form of Frances McDormand's character, Margie. The main comedy in the movie comes in the questions asked by the viewer: ""Why are they doing this like this? Surely there is a better way?"" The point is none of these characters really realise how to do the tasks they've been assigned, and fail in the simplest, most embarrassing manner, like watching somebody fall of a bicycle in slow motion. But the more thrilling parts of the movie come when these characters are given the power to capture, harm, or kill.<br/><br/>To say anything else would risk spoiling the movie, but know that it is an essential to modern contemporary comedy, in telling a repeated story from a unique perspective."

","I finally watched this movie after seeing it on a number of top movie lists. I have to admit it was even better than I thought it would be. I enjoyed the acting, the characters, the cinematography and the music. But the screenplay and the plot was what really made this movie as good as it was. I like the way the movie moved a long at a certain pace but kept building on the plot and things just kept getting deeper and deeper. Both from the side of the criminals and the side of the law enforcement. I cant say enough about this movie and would like to avoid spoiling it for everybody but I do admit you really need to see it. Some movies don't need a lot of special effects in order to succeed. As we can see in Fargo and more recently in Nebraska. I gave it nine stars out of ten and for me that is a near perfect score."

","The jokes in this movie brilliantly contrast the dark murder scenes. It's a perfect portrayal of a kidnapping gone wrong. Jerry Lundegaard (William H Macy) is a struggling car salesman who pays two criminals Gaear Grimsrud (Peter Stormare) and Carl Showalter (Steve Buscemi) to kidnap his wife, Jean Lundegaard (Kristen Rudrud), and demand a ransom from her father Wade Gustafson (Harve Presnell). But when Grimsrud kills a police officer and two witnesses to the crime an angry Showalter his demanding more money from Ludegaard and a higher ransom from Wade. To complicate things for Lundegaard even further, Chief Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) is closing in on his crime in a very Columbo style fashion.

"maildamjana","10","0","0","10 September 2015"," Just my two cents about the movie
","I've read some of the forum posts about this movie (in a board where the public wasn't so greeting) and I saw multiple complaints about the annoying accents, boring story, unnecessary dialogs and so on.<br/><br/>I have no clue where does that come from. It seems pretty clear to me that the accent was intentionally exaggerated in a satiric fashion so we get a sense that everyone there is dumb. Therefore I find it fascinating that the female officer whatshername pulled such an extraordinary role in which she shows her wit while being strained by boundaries of her yahs and ohyahs. I really don't understand the negative critics on her (""she acts like she has a stick in her a**). As far as for WH Maceman, I find his looks perfectly suitable for the role (even more than Martin Freeman was who plays a character with an identic personality in the TV show), doesn't he look and act like a real p****? I thought that's exactly what he's intended to do.<br/><br/>Also about the dull dialog and story I simply couldn't disagree more. I like that I don't anticipate anything in this movie, interesting action is omnipresent. You can literally enjoy every scene without the eagerness of anticipation for the next one. I really liked that.<br/><br/>All in all, I find this movie really intriguing and I rated it with a 10/10 though I don't considerate it as a pure masterpiece but it fascinated me to death so the grade is well deserved."

","The Coen brothers are cinematic geniuses and Fargo demonstrates this genius beautifully. The film blends casual (even mundane) 'Minnesota nice' with the harsh macabre of crime and death. <br/><br/>What starts off as a simple crime story slowly adds more layers, becoming increasingly complex as the crime begins to get out of hand. Whilst many films may struggle with such a convoluted storyline, the Coen brothers manage to deal with this in such a beautifully intricate way that prevents the viewer from ever being confused or disinterested but instead the audience can be truly impressed by the Coen's ability to handle such a story and pull it off so beautifully. <br/><br/>The success of the film, however, is not entirely thanks to the brothers but credit is also due to the magnificent acting talent. William H Macy and Steve Buscemi both give amazing performances but the true star of the show is Marge Gunderson, played to perfection by Frances McDormand. This film is both great entertainment and beautiful art."

","The Coen Brothers are in that rare stratum of writers/directors who seem to have formed a genre of their own. (Woody Allen, Hitchcock and Wes Anderson are other examples)<br/><br/>The argument over which is their greatest film will never be settled, but Fargo is surely a strong contender. The Coens always manage to create atmospheres that are simultaneously realistic and stylised; rarely comfortable. Here, in the relationship between Marge and Norm Gunderson, there's a rare glimpse of their ""cozy"" side - and it's wonderfully touching. Outside of that, however, the film is unsettling, occasionally vividly violent, and darkly comic. <br/><br/>The gradual disintegration of Jerry Lundegaard (William H Macy), as his spineless, cowardly plan unravels, and he flails against the ever-tightening net of his own lies, is a sight to behold, with the Macy playing the part absolutely perfectly - you almost feel sorry for him at first, but your sympathy runs out as the film continues. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, Frances McDormand plays Marge Gunderson, one of the most admirable police officers ever seen on screen - this is not a bumbling, dull-witted small-town copper. Nor is she the ace detective with a disastrous home life we see so often. An original, rounded character with depth, a history and a future. <br/><br/>Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare... well if they've turned in a bad performance between them on film I'm yet to see it. <br/><br/>It's a crime drama, a thriller, a dark comedy... but really the best description of Fargo is, It's a Coen Brothers Film. <br/><br/>yetanotherfilmreviewblog.tumblr.com"

","Well, I was hoping this snowy movie would help on August 1st, since it's too damned hot out and there's probably another 3 months of summer in Glendale, Arizona. Eh, not really.<br/><br/>I have only seen this movie once before, I believe in late 1996 or 1997, so it's been awhile. Despite the nearly two decade absence, I'm usually good at remembering movie's specific scenes, plot points and dialogue. Here, I barely remembered 20% of the actions in this. It probably didn't help that I know I got laid that night when I invited my friend over to see this. To my defense, we probably got it on during the viewing.<br/><br/>Maybe that was a good thing. It was interesting to revisit this as practically a first time. There's just so much that happens and it made it all seem so real, despite the lie at the beginning of the film that this was a true story. (Extremely loosely based is NOT a ""true story"" in my book. I could see a horrific traffic accident and decide to write an alien invasion story that involved a car crash. That wouldn't make that a true story. Much like this.)<br/><br/>I've never been to Fargo or any of the many towns featured here, let alone Minnesota and though I've heard of ""the accent"" and key phrases ""Don'tcha know"" and ""Yeeeeeah."" I don't think I'd want to visit if this movie was accurate with the dialect. Man, this movie was tough to get through at times with all the Sarah Palin-type slurs. Again, since I've never been to these locations, I cannot verify if any of this is true to the locals. But, dang, if the snow didn't do me in, the talking would.<br/><br/>I digress, the acting, tension and incredible script is completely worthwhile here and makes this a recommendation. The fact that it keeps going and going and the less than stellar police keep up with what's happening is probably part of the most unbelievable, but enjoyable parts. Frances McDormand's Marge is a dumbed down Columbo, but William H. Macy's Jerry was the real star here. Have to hate him, especially at his job, but I got more invested in him that the film's award-winning main attraction of McDormand. <br/><br/>I think the Coens perfected this movie years later with No Country For Old Men, but they still did a great job with this effort and it's totally recommended.<br/><br/>* * *<br/><br/>Final thoughts: To give a little background, lazy and unintelligible word usage, namely filler words, irritate the crap out of me. It's unoriginal, unimaginative and worst of all, unnecessary. Thank God for earplugs as definitely need them at my job to attempt to block out all the ""Yeeeeeah""s I hear roughly 78 times a day, mostly from one person. Oh, and while we're on this movie, just an FYI, Office Space is much more a ""true story"" than Fargo was. Apply at a call center, get hired and try to dispute that statement. I'll wait."

","This movie opens with the words ""This is a true story. The events depicted in this film took place in Minnesota in 1987. At the request of the survivors, the names have been changed. Out of respect for the dead, the rest has been told exactly as it occurred."" I never challenged these words, but apparently no such incidents as depicted in this film ever occurred. The movie plays out quite believably - A middle-class car salesman gets in over his head financially by embezzling from his employer, thinking that the business deals he is making with the money will allow him to replace the stolen goods before he is detected. When his schemes don't pan out he must find a way to replace the money. The salesman's father-in-law - and employer - is wealthy but distant and indifferent towards him, so he hatches a plan to fake his wife's kidnapping with the help of two felons he doesn't know at all who are ""vouched for"" by an ex-con mechanic that works at the same dealership he works for. He figures his father-in-law will pay the ransom, he'll split it with the felons, and his problems will be solved. This is not to be the case. It turns out that these felons are more violent and uncontrollable than the salesman counted on, and they leave quite a body count in their wake. Also, in another clever twist, what becomes of the ransom money over which so many greedy people in the film have fought and died is quite ironic to say the least. Although I wouldn't exactly say we read this story in the paper everyday, we all have read something similar - someone who has lived an ordinary life for several decades suddenly gets tempted into some criminal activity that quickly escalates out of control.<br/><br/>The person who unravels the mystery of the crimes is the most unstereotypical of police officers - Marge Gunderson. She is the extremely pregnant chief of police in the small town where the first murders occur, and her combination of brains and folksy charm masterfully handle witnesses and trace the crime back to the car salesman and his dealership.<br/><br/>I've never been to Minnesota, but if the Coens' rendition of that state and its people was as spot-on as their parody of the American southwest in ""Raising Arizona"", then they have really done their research. I highly recommend it."

","As we read the text informing us that Fargo is a true story (which is a lie), we are introduced to the somber music which contains a medieval feel to it, being performed on harp to start, then switching to the use of more strings and drums. This small portion of music is powerful in that it conveys exactly the tone of the movie: we know collectively as an audience that this will be an upsetting story which takes place in a fairly ""innocent"" location – Minnesota.<br/><br/>Why is this film titled ""Fargo,"" exactly? It is where everything is set into motion. The William H. Macy character (Lundegaard) drives up there to meet the two ""villains"" of the story who he employs to kidnap his wife so that they may con money from his wife's father. We don't know this right away, however; in fact, the information we're told is only certain bits, so we cannot fathom how simple this rather complex plan really is at first. Making the situation complex for the viewer, however, lets us know that anything can and will go wrong – and what do you know, it does.<br/><br/>While Frances McDormand may be the protagonist of the story, let's talk first about the best talent in this film – William H Macy. After watching this film, without knowledge of the show ""Shameless,"" I doubt anybody could predict this actor would be a good fit for Frank Gallagher in Shameless – stubborn as hell, alcoholic, selfish, terrible father, anything but respectable. In Fargo, Macy portrays Lundegaard with perfect execution, a role on the opposite pole of his iconic Frank Gallagher. Lundegaard is a first time criminal, and it shows through the fact that he is an every-day-nice-guy, not very outspoken, and holds in his anger so much that he explodes when he needs to let it out. Macy tackles the overall nervousness of the character so well that he develops perfect mannerisms for the character – looking down due to shyness frequently, moments of losing control that are just right and not overly dramatic, stuttering, and a stupid smile to retain his innocence despite the horrific plot he carries out, putting his family in danger time and time again. Macy's portrayal is arguably the best performance of the film, yet he lost the best supporting Oscar to none other than Cuba Gooding Jr's role in ""Jerry Maguire"" that year.<br/><br/>Another strong aspect of the film is the character played by Steve Buscemi. Everybody thinks it, and the Coen brothers say it time and time again in their script: Steve Buscemi sure is a ""funny-looking fellow."" This is brought up at least twice by witnesses in the case – one prostitute and one bartender, who act as substitutes for the audience, the voyeur, the cinephile who observes and comments, but does not contribute much to the actual story. Buscemi's character is egotistical, funny, filled with rage; he is given authority which he does not deserve as Shep, who put Lundegaard in contact with Buscemi's friend, did not vouch for the Buscemi character. Buscemi is the comic relief to his counter part's scary, more dominating and menacing presence – he is a giant compared to Buscemi and does not talk unless it has to do with the job they have set out to do. This seems to be one of the only reasons Buscemi has to do practically everything – he goes alone on the actual ""exchange"" of the money and Mrs. Lundegaard, leaving only him to have to deal with the near- fatal surprise in store for him. He returns with the money for his partner (though he does not tell him there is much more buried in the middle of nowhere) and he rightfully complains that Gaear did not suffer an injury like him, though his deception is greedy and egotistical. It turns out that Gaear has a greedy nature too, possibly much greedier than Carl (Buscemi) since he thinks a sum of only eighty thousand dollars is involved and his reaction is very extreme.<br/><br/>Then we have Frances McDormand, playing Marge Gunderson, the protagonist who does not show up until thirty minutes into the film. If it were not for the presence of this character in the film, this movie would be an extremely depressing story. Marge represents the average Minnesota citizen who finds happiness with the simplicity of family life. She serves the police force as she serves her family – she is the sole breadwinner for her and her husband Norm, and she is pregnant, yet embarks on this mysterious, dangerous journey to find two murderers in order to put them behind bars. Her short speech to Gaear towards the end of the film is exactly what the film needs – it is reassurance that we are not alone in this world when we don't understand the evil behind greed which drives people to do the most awful things and strive so far from morality. One final comment is that I love the presence of the character Mike Yanagita in this film. Most people would find this character to simply be a comic relief character, but as my brother pointed out, the fact that he lied about his life and was so convincing about it drives Marge to return to Lundegaard, who appeared to be just as innocent as Mike on the surface. To be honest, I thought this character was simple comic relief on first impression, but this didn't make too much sense to me since it did not drive the story further if that was the case, and I knew the Coen brothers are considered great filmmakers.<br/><br/>I very strongly recommend this film to all viewers who are comfortable with watching an R-rated film: it is simply one of the greatest dark comedies/crime dramas ever made."

","Fargo (1996): Dir: Ethan Coen, Joel Coen / Cast: William H. Macy, Frances McDormand, Steve Buscemi, Peter Stormare, Harve Presnell: Satire about place and happening starring William H. Macy as a car salesman threatened with bankruptcy. He hires two thugs to kidnap his wife but everything goes wrong. His father-in-law insists on delivering the money and Macy is unable to contact the kidnappers. This all concludes with shock, humour and surprise. Splendid directing by Joel and Ethan Coen who previously made Blood Simple and Barton Fink. Frances McDormand is wonderful as a pregnant police woman investigating the case. She is the one character who lives for right, and her dialogue upon solving the case sums it up with blunt delivery. Macy flawlessly plays a desperate man smitten by guilt. He is clearly terrible at crime and even worse at trying to prevent it. Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare play two thugs. Buscemi is talkative and ill tempered but it is his final footage that is memorably shocking. Stormare is more reserved and quiet, which conceals his dangerous tendencies that are defeated by a fragile physical state and strong will of an opposing factor. Harve Presnell plays Macy's father-in-law who adds further complications when he decides to deliver the ransom cash himself. Theme exposes guilt and our ever present urge to hide sin. Score: 9 / 10"
"cara-isabella4","8","0","0","18 May 2015"," Combines small town pleasantries with macabre violence, in an absurdly humorous tale of debauchery. Great movie.
","Independent film makers, the Coen brothers have achieved critical and box-office success with their two-time Oscar award winning film, Fargo. ¬The ""homespun murder mystery"" is an amalgamation of genres: crime drama, violent thriller, neo-noir, and, satirical comedy. The offbeat narrative juxtaposes small town pleasantries and lightheartedness with macabre violence, in an absurdly humorous tale of debauchery. Critical distance is a key element of ¬Fargo, which is a result of the frequent use of farce in their depictions of ""everyday violence in US culture"" (Lewis 2002). Through this, an ""original social commentary"" emerges, amongst the crazy, sardonic, approaches to style and narrative. The cult and spectacle of violence in American society is epitomized in the film, depicted through the thoughtless killings, and most, notably, in the infamous wood chipper scene. <br/><br/>The frequent shots of the characters devouring fast food underscores the theme of cheap mass production and the bland consumerist society whilst simultaneously striking a balance between the comfortable, mundane lifestyle of the townsfolk and the bizarre, sinister kidnapping situation. Place functions as a key element in Fargo. The blindingly white winter of North Dakota's Fargo is used ""evocatively and satirically"", and the folksy dialect of the mid-westerners is exaggerated and distinct. The immaculate, whitewashed setting, and the carefully constructed cinematography acts as a prime vehicle for fostering the outrageous story as it unfolds in perfect chaos. The stylistic device of the 'true story' claim, manipulates audiences into suspending their belief and accepting the film as it is."

","A violently funny crime caper is what 'Fargo' might appear to be, but that is really not the essence. The actual protagonist is not introduced until a half hour into the film (something that reminds me of 'Psycho', which did pretty much the opposite). By then, we have met a load of shady characters and mutually uninvolved family members. And things are already way out of hand. It is as if we wake up with Margie to a world of horrors, but her up-and-at-'em demeanor helps us pull through. There is a final moment of utter disbelief that wells up inside her, but the cozy, hopeful finale is nothing short of uplifting.<br/><br/>While much of the customs and language of these Minnesota inhabitants may seem funny if you're not from there, but this sort of 'funny' is ultimately in the mind of the beholder. The melancholy soundtrack underlines this, as does the magnificent cinematography, with overwhelming images, such as that little car with Carl and Gaear driving in the distance, under an enormous gray sky, or when Jerry walks back to his car, as possibly seen by Wade and Stan.<br/><br/>Some people complain that the Coens' interpretation of the Minnesotans was insulting, probably being Minnesotans themselves? Personally, I don't believe the Coens set out to do that, and that should appear particularly improbable when the final result is such a fine piece of cinema - with a heart. And where are the Coens themselves from, by the way? That's right...<br/><br/>10 out of 10, as always."

","Granted this movie did not have all of the kind of stuff I normally gravitate towards. Missing were the car chases, the shootouts and heroes clad in tights and cape. I would have walked away if others had not coaxed me into sitting through this. Am I glad they did. This definitely was not the dud I thought it might have been. I was glued to the screen from beginning to end. This potboiler of a murder mystery had me sitting at the edge of my seat from the opening credits. Every scene perfectly introduced...leading the viewer into the next. This is a well crafted story with an outstanding cast. First we have a perfectly shaky and conniving William H. Macy - you just know he is up to no good. Let's face it, this guy has guilty written all over him even when he is completely innocent. And then you've got Marge ""You got Arby's all Over Me"" Gunderson who just happens to be one clever(and unintentionally funny) Chief of Police. She is a natural crime solver, with an analytical mind who is bound and determined to get to the bottom of the crime. I know, I know – it all kind of sounds like a rehash of a rehash of a rehash...it isn't...it gets better. For one thing, ""Fargo"" is so bitterly cold, nature is naturally more angry than normal. On top of the wind, the cold and the snow...you have these two snakes in the grass...well that would actually be snakes in the snow. These two jewels of humanity (played by Peter Stormare and Steve Buscemi (awesome firefighter by the way.)) match the horrible weather conditions. These guys have no respect for life. Sounding good so far? Well just wait. The main star of this movie is probably the wood chipper. It has no lines, no dancing skits or no songs...but it does have a few minutes of fame. If you have not seen the movie yetjust think about wood-chipper and the cool things you can do with it. I won't spoil it and go any farther. What I will say is that I highly recommend this movie – it is a nail biter."

","In case you don't know, the minimalistly-titled 'Fargo' cemented the Coen brothers' reputation as auteurs of modern cinema. There was something about the film which just simply worked. I've already used the term 'minimalist' once and I can't really think of a better word to use to describe the film.<br/><br/>William H Macy plays 'Jerry,' a married man in financial trouble. Feeling he has no way out, he decides to hire a couple of unsavoury characters to stage a kidnapping of his wife. During their first meeting, the two 'hoods' aren't as dumb as they may look and enquire as to why he wishes to 'pay his own ransom.' Jerry's idea is that it will be his rich father in law who will pay and the cash will be split between himself and the 'kidnappers.' What could possibly go wrong? Well... quite a bit, actually. I won't go into too many details about what happens (or more importantly all the different ways things don't always work out the way you plan) as that's half the fun. The only thing you really need to know is that there are no car chases and the one shoot out is hardly akin to something you'd see in a Matrix film. The film ambles along from one beautifully-bleak winter's setting to the next, as the people go about their (sometimes pretty shady) business.<br/><br/>It's fair to say that Fargo is pretty slow moving. Now, sometimes that comes as a drawback, yet here, it just seems to work. Soon a police officer is on both Jerry and the kidnappers' trail, which brings added heat on everyone concerned. And, in my opinion, this is the film's only drawback. Frances McDormand plays 'Marge,' the local sheriff who starts putting two and two together. It was on about the second viewing of Fargo that I realised what I didn't like about her. She was pregnant. Now, my reason for feeling this way is because Fargo is a pretty dark affair – you won't know who's going to come a cropper at the hands of a madman at any time. However, it's a brave film-maker who dares to harm a pregnant woman. Now, Marge is clearly the only truly 'good' character – she's smart, kind, clever and likable, but, being pregnant, you kind of know that nothing bad is going to happen to her. This, for me anyway, took away a little bit of tension from the 'chase.' But, that's just a minor gripe. If you like your crime films slow and bleak then you'll be one of the many who've enjoyed this. The Coen brothers have made plenty of good films since (and a few slightly more forgettable ones), but this one is definitely their finest hour. And, I've managed to come to the end of the review without managing to mention Steve Buscemi – he's in it too. And, as always, he's great – just in case you needed an extra reason to watch."

","Of all the Cohen Brother's tremendously entertaining movies, this is the best. This is the one that they will be remembered for. William H. Macy plays Jerry Lundegaard, a man in a spot. He's a used car salesman that has been securing loans for cars that are not really in his lot. The bank is calling in the loans, threatening legal action, and he needs money fast. He forms a plan to have his own wife kidnapped, thereby splitting the ransom money between himself and the kidnappers. It's a terrible plan, and it quickly unravels into a bloody mess of murder and betrayal. When bodies begin to mount, a local police officer, Marge Gunderson, is called in. Frances McDormand plays Marge Gunderson, and she makes the movie magical. McDormand won an Oscar for the role, and this is one instance when the recipient deserved the award. She plays ""Margie"" with a huge dose of humanity. She is a character that sneaks up on you. When she is introduced, you wonder if perhaps she is just a small town officer in way over her head. She is pregnant, speaks in small town (Minnesota) idioms, and throws up from morning sickness when investigating the first brutal murders. She seems more like a nice, Minnesotan housewife than a cop. But early you get the feeling that there is something special about her. The killings involve a traffic cop that was killed while issuing a ticket for a missing plate. In his log book, he was written DLR. When Marge's fellow officer says that he has run a search for all tags starting with DLR, Marge says gently, ""I'm not sure I agree with you 100 percent on your police work there, Irv."" She explains to Irv that DLR means that it was a new car, a dealer's car. ""Oooh"" says Irv, staring into space. Then Marge tells Irv a joke about the guy that couldn't afford a vanity license plate, so he changed his name to FGS1135. ""That's a good one,"" says Irv, but it is clear Marge's wit has gone over his head. The brilliance of the scene is that Marge is never cruel or condescending to Irv, never thinks less of him, and is not making fun of him. She is simply enjoying her own intelligence, and we can see the very private sparkle in her eyes. Marge also has a core of steel. Watch the scene where she gets information from a menacing suspect by reminding him, with almost motherly concern, about all the trouble he has been in with the law, and the fact that he is actually in violation of his parole. She cracks him like an egg without ever loosing her smile. All actors concerned give great performances. Steve Buscemi brings his pitch-perfect snide larceny to the table, playing one of the kidnappers; and Peter Stormare (who once played Hamlet in an Igmar Bergman production) utters perhaps 15 words in a terrifying performance as the other kidnapper. And, of course, William H. Macey couldn't have played it Better. His Jerry Lundegaard is so full of stress and fear, you can't watch him without squirming. I have read where this film has been criticized for making fun of the people of Minnesota, poking fun at their accents and manners. This is not true. The Coen Brothers grew up in Minneapolis, and this is their homage to their own people. The folks in Minnesota may talk funny to the reviewers watching movies in New York and Los Angeles, but this film in no way makes fun of them. At the end of the day, Marge and her husband are happily going to sleep in their bed, in love with one another and content with their shared life. How many other couples portrayed in a Coen Brother's film can make this claim? How anyone can watch Marge Gunderson in action and think the Coen's were making fun of her is beyond me. Like Marge, they are simply enjoying their own intelligence."

","The best movies are the ones that not only tell a good story, but make you think about yourself. They can be inspirational stories that make us strive to be better, or cautionary tales to make us more aware of things to look out for in life. Alternatively, they can make us think about who we really are – this is where ""Fargo"" comes in. In anyone else's hands, ""Fargo"" would be a very ordinary movie, telling the story of a series of crimes and a detective who tries to solve them. In the hands of the Coen Brothers, it's a gory and often hilarious look at criminal life in cold Minnesota, and the oddball characters involved in it.<br/><br/>The focus for the first third of the film is Jerry Lundegaard, a car salesman played superbly by William H. Macy, who is in need of money, and hires two criminals (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wife so that he can take some of the ransom money. He's a brilliantly written character, who gets far too nervous in the tricky situations he's stuck in, and always tries to recover as things don't go his way. As things go wrong for the criminals they are forced to kill a number of witnesses, which gives them even more problems. This brings in the film's main character, pregnant Police Chief Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand), who is calm and polite in her investigations and fascinating to watch. McDormand manages to steal the show brilliantly, with her awkward facial expressions at times and perfectly placed one-liners at others. It's difficult to see anyone else playing the role.<br/><br/>The script of the film is so sharp, but it's rare that the Coen Brothers don't deliver that for us. Why does the film make you think about yourself though? Because of its violence and the way you react to it. When Jerry's wife is being kidnapped, she hides in the shower and then runs along the hall unable to escape from the shower curtain, eventually falling down the stairs. It's brutal, but it's so ridiculous and so well shot that it's also kind of funny. The criminals, especially Buscemi's character, are so idiotic that their mishaps, including Buscemi being shot in the face, also make you laugh. The thing that really makes all of this click is the setting, the wintry town of Fargo, its bizarre residents and particularly the accent. There is one scene where Marge only says ""Yah"", but does it in such a way that it can't help being funny. They're ridiculous without being too simple, and constantly watchable.<br/><br/>""Fargo"" is a relatively brief movie, at only 98 minutes long, but it uses every second to its advantage in painting this brilliant, funny and bizarre story. It shows all of its actors, and its two directors, at their very best, and doesn't let up for one moment so that you are always willing to go along for the ride."

The basic premise is a rare one, a lying husband decide to con his way to his father-in-law's money turns out of control and claiming many lives. The story and focus dramatization were developed well; it was able to emphasize the thriller aspect as well as at the same time presenting the quirkiness of the story in the characters. We have a contradicting pair of kidnappers, one a foul-mouthed talker while the other one a calm and silent yet sadistic. On the other side of the story we have the easy-going and spirited policewoman. The acting is quite good that it can take you deep into the story despite all the quirks in the story. Macy and McDormand performed their roles well; they managed to keep me interested in seeing what's next for them. While the quirky pair of Buscemi and Stormare can bring a few laughs into the horrific tale told here."

","Fargo is a movie with a very well done and likable style that definitely made me think about. With its clever plot and its enjoyable script, Fargo does not disappoint. Set between Fargo, North Dakota and Brainerd, Minnesota, the movie comes off with a very strong sense of a small town. This may be because of the excellent performances delivered by William H. Macy, Steve Buscemi, Peter Stormare, and Oscar-winning Frances McDormand. Though the movie is very much so a drama, I found myself grinning at many comical scenes in the movie. The accents are great, Steve Buscemi is a great villain, and William H. Macy is perfect as a man struggling to keep afloat above the debts he owes. The movie is about Jerry Lundegaard, a man facing a mid-life crisis due to the debts that loom over him. To get out of debt, he hires two criminals to kidnap his wife in an effort to trick his father-in-law into paying a ransom for his daughter back. The 80,000 dollars in the ransom would be split between Jerry and the two criminals. But things take a turn for the worse when blood is shed and Jerry makes the unfortunate mistake of trusting criminals. Fargo is clever, unpredictable, and bold so I definitely recommend it."

","This movie was a great movie but not only that it is also the best movie of 1996, the movie tells the story about a man named Jerry Lundegaard (played by William H.

Based on a true story the movie itself was a true masterpiece of the police movie genre, in which it compares to Dirty Harry, The French Connection, Lethal Weapon, Die Hard, and many more. Director Joel Coen can make a classic out of each and every movie him and his brother Ethan Coen can make together. Frances McDormand gives the best performance of her career in this crime, comedy, thriller, masterpiece. This truly should have won the 1996 Oscar for best picture instead of The English Patient because Fargo required a lot more entertainment than The English Patient did. Also this movie is not only a great movie but it is a Coen brothers classic."

","The Coen Brothers' screw with the audience from the get-go with their 1996 Best Picture nominee Fargo, widely considered their finest work amongst a filmography that can be compared to that of any of the greats. Claiming this to be based on a true story when it is in fact anything but, the Coen's cement Fargo's twisted and now highly recognisable quirkiness from the first second, only for us to transported into this strange and oddball world of funny accents, eternal snowfall, wood- chippers and kinda-funny-lookin' criminals. In fact, the movie is not even set in Fargo at all. We glimpse it briefly before moving onto Brainerd, Minnesota, where the tremors of a dangerous arrangement are played out with violence and greed.<br/><br/>Car salesman Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy), in a desperate attempt to make some quick cash to fund a real estate deal, hires two hit men - Carl (Steve Buscemi) and Gaear (Peter Stormare) - to kidnap his wife and split the ransom money paid by her wealthy father Wade (Harve Presnell). With the deal arranged, Jerry makes a final plea to Wade for investment, only for Wade to accept. Jerry tries to call the kidnapping off, but it is too late, and soon enough Carl and Gaear are leaving a trail of murders behind them. With a triple shooting at Brainerd that leaves a state trooper dead, pregnant police chief Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) is called in to investigate the crime spree.<br/><br/>What the Coen's, cinematographer Roger Deakins and music scorer Carter Burwell created with Fargo is a film like no other, where a giant statue of a lumberjack carrying an axe looms over the film like some unconventional deity, and the characters are equally as mocked as they are warmly captured. With their small-town ways and strange, chirpy Swedish-American accents, not many of the characters in Fargo seem to notice the darkness that has crept into their town, and seem content with planning fishing trips, shuffling along the buffet table, or discussing the weather. The accent works like a character itself, a portal into these character's lives. You've most likely quoted ""you betcha!"" or ""oh, geez,"" in homage at some point if you've seen this movie before.<br/><br/>Fargo also treads dangerously along the black comedy line, somehow making a man being blended through a wood-chipper hilarious and throwing us off course entirely with Marge's bizarre and uncomfortable catch-up drink with lonely friend-from-school Mike (Steve Park). But the Coen's have always done that, and probably never more successful than with this. The cruelty that the Coen's inflict on the rather loathsome characters seems somehow just, and offer a truly lovable character in Marge, one of the Coen's greatest creations, and wonderfully performed by the Oscar-winning McDormand. This is a masterpiece, a defining moment for Joel and Ethan Coen, who have created a haunting, strange, dark and very funny noir, and possibly the greatest film of the 1990's.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"

Lots of great minor characters on both McDormand and Macy's sides of the story.

","The Coen brothers consistently give us great cinema. And they give us movies that aren't just good, but memorable. While this film isn't their best, it definitely comes off as disturbing and memorable. Even though the opening credits state that all events in the film actually took place, the entire film's plot is fictional. Which works well in the Coen bros favor. Making us get more invested in characters and events that took place.<br/><br/>The Coen bros greatest strength has always come from their script, and this film is no exception. The writing and directing work perfectly together. Even without any huge actors, each of them give good performances, although I don't know about the idea of Midwesterners being this weird. I realize the Coens grew up in Minnesota so they have first hand experience but the accents were kind of overdone, and at times made the characters come off as stupid. With that being said I really enjoyed what Frances McDormand did with her character. She comes off as really the only likable character in the entire movie. And truly deserved the Oscar she received. William H. Macy was good as well but near the end I wanted to punch him in the face.<br/><br/>I wonder what the T.V series will be like. If they go the route of remake I don't think it will work, but if you just say it's within the same world the Coen bros created, then I think it works great. I am glad to hear the Coens are at least producing. Maybe have the series take place in Fargo this time? <br/><br/>Back to the film, I think it's a re-watchable film because of the dark humor and impeccable writing, even with the sudden violence. I wouldn't put the movie in my top 5 Coen bros movies but it was significant in helping them reach the top of directing and writing in film.<br/><br/>7.7/10"

","I think of Fargo as the underdog of cinema; the unassuming, easy-to-miss crime thriller when released that went on to be recognized for its intricate and investing plot, powerhouse displays of acting, and keen regional nuances. The film has now gone on to – dare I say – be something of a classic for the mystery genre, producing several quotable lines, memorable setups, and even a TV show, set to debut later this year.<br/><br/>Reviewing a classic is always touchy territory for two specific reasons. The first is that many people have already seen, reviewed, analyzed, and formulated an opinion on the film in question and writing a positive review seems like reiterating all the same points people have done for years and preaching to a disinterested choir. The second is that it's a struggle to find something to talk about in said film that hasn't already been talked about many times before, resulting in a review or an analysis that seems to become groggy and repetitive.<br/><br/>With Fargo, however, I'm feeling pretty comfortable in where I stand and what I have to say about it. Explaining the film's story in writing or aloud may find a way to muddle itself, but I'll push through to give the basics. The story involves a crooked car salesman named Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy), who works at a Minneapolis dealership. Pressed for money and fighting desperate times, he negotiates with criminals Carl Showalter (Steve Buscemi) and Gaear Grimsrud (Peter Stormare), whom he meets on a trip to Fargo, North Dakota, to kidnap his wife Jean (Kristin Rudrüd) in exchange for a 1987 Oldsmobile Ciera and $40,000 of the $80,000 ransom. Jerry, in a slick move, plans to inform his wealthy father-in-law and boss Wade Gustafson (Harve Presenell) that the ransom the crooks are asking for is $1,000,000 with the intent of pocketing most of the money.<br/><br/>This plan soon turns disastrous by circumstances that should not be spoiled. However, when things go awry and people end up dead, Officer Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand), a quirky, Minneapolis cop with a thick accent, gets on the case and is determined to imprison the dirtbags behind these murders. What we get, though, is an exercise in terrific filmmaking in several areas, from acting, pacing, and depictions and the satirizing of a region that do not tread on mean-spirited, simple-minded jabs for humor. At the core of Fargo is a performance by William H. Macy that needs to be seen to be believed; it's a true performance that spawns mixed reactions, as he sometimes portrays a character we can side with, and other times, portrays one we can't help but loathe. Macy's scenes with Buscemi and Stormare are wonderful too, as all the actors bring something to the table: Macy brings his controlled nature that can often be seen as troublesome, Buscemi brings his outrageousness, and Stormare brings his collective mannerisms.<br/><br/>The Coen brothers, Joel (the film's director) and Ethan (the film's co-writer and sole credited producer), could've stopped there and had a great film, but they continue on, with a windy, but completely investing storyline predicated off of plot and wild twists and turns. Normally, I criticize films that make too heavy of an emphasize on story and not enough on character. Instead, the Coen brothers make each individual character distinct in someway, be it their mannerisms, what they say, or even how they say it. This is where the attention to detail for the region comes in. Frequently, the Coens make dual note of the typical niceness Midwesterners tend to possess, as well as the moralistic goodness they provide through their often thick and monotone accents.<br/><br/>The Coens turn Fargo into a hilariously observant work, complete with great pacing, Roger Deakins' impeccable cinematography that never fails to capture locational beauty, making the Midwestern snow shockingly appealing and lovely, and just the benefits of a great story. It's the kind of film that would make a great introduction for people in other countries who have never seen an American film, rather than the abundance of blockbusters and low-rent sequels, don't you think?<br/><br/>Starring: William H. Macy, Steve Buscemi, Peter Stormare, Frances McDormand, Harve Presnell, and Kristin Rudrüd. Directed by: Joel Coen."

It isn't common to see quite so much on the screen. The bitter chill of the air can almost be felt but alongside this is the coziness and reassurance of the interiors. The people are the opposite, warm and fluffy on the outside but all played with an underlying menace, like they could break at any moment. The giant fictional statue of Paul Bunyon epitomises this, it is no doubt meant to be a figure of hard work and community spirit but the camera lingers on it for an uncomfortably long time until it becomes ominous.<br/><br/>For all intents and purposes, this is a Coen Brothers re-imagining of a classic film-noir, a ""film-blanc"" even, both thematically with its humour visually with the ice. The sense of place is very strong, the accents are turned up to eleven, there is a lack of social diversity and the only minorities represented are unstable. The close sense of community gives it a polish of friendliness and safety. The performances are delivered with ham as well so despite the genuinely horrific events, they are by no means as affecting as they could be.<br/><br/>Fargo is an odd film. It is gruesome yet friendly, bitterly cold yet somehow warm, horrific yet somehow family friendly. Though it does not quite reach the atmospheric heights of No Country For Old Men or the comedic heights of The Big Lebowski, what is perhaps most interesting about Fargo is that it would make a deliciously sadistic yet surprisingly cuddly and neat Christmas film.

","Fargo is well-titled, since the region as a whole, up-front and friendly to an absurd degree, is a major character unto itself, albeit stuffed to the seams with the Coen brothers' infamous wrinkles and eccentric dashes of character. That it all feels so strangely authentic (our auteurs grew up in the area) only makes it even harder to turn away; it's the unimagined point in time and space where Strange Brew meets Reservoir Dogs. Offset by the cordial, affable nature of the general population, this film's frequent forays into spontaneous bloodshed and calculated, if bumbling, barbarism are downright hypnotic. Despite fantastic performances from Steve Buscemi, Peter Stormare (the most visceral villains, scumbags with neither principals nor reservations) and William H. Macy (the real monster), the floor belongs to Frances McDormand. She thoroughly owns the screen as police chief Marge Gunderson, a pregnant ball of contradiction whose peachy exterior masks a tough, no-nonsense detective's intellect.

","How far North can you go before the freezing temperatures, sleet, and zero visibility will inevitably cause snow blindness, and render things incomprehensibly simple. Blood Simple (1984), the Coen Bros. first Movie seemed to ask the same question about going South, except that there it is the desert and heat stroke that will make things unbearably complex among the simplicity.<br/><br/>Most Film Critics and even some astute casual Movie Watchers will know about that Style and Substance thing. The Coens usually deliver a substantial amount of both and that's Their Secret Ingredient. That blend of herbs and spices that make Their Films tasty and delicious.<br/><br/>This is one bleak and brutal Movie, that is also Funny. You there at Film School, try and pull that one off and if you do Hollywood is waiting, and so is Box Office and Critical acclaim. The Characters here, are not Ivy League Smart, they are homespun, earthy, and are on top of things even when that isn't obvious.<br/><br/>The Movie is pristine looking and void of much Color, except maybe Red and it is the Red against White contrast that is the Template of this fine Character Study. With just a touch of steely Blue added from Mythical Icons, this is a solidified American Fairy Tale that takes place just this side of the Canadian Border. Yah, this is a Great Movie. Whoa Daddy!"

","McDormand and Macy are magic in this film. Their performances are so incredible they are really unforgettable. Macy was robbed of the Oscar for this, really two of the most memorable film performances in years. I cannot believe how many award-winning roles pale in comparison to what they achieved in this film.<br/><br/>I could watch this movie over and over again just to watch these two. And that doesn't even factor in Buscemi and Stormare who are both excellent. <br/><br/>Movies this good do not come around very often. It is a treat to watch such great work with a screenplay that is so funny and thrilling at the same time. A great, great film."
"cinecopia1","10","0","0","8 October 2013"," An Ode to Fargo
","This film, in a nutshell, is about a lot of nasty things that happen in a deep, dark, slow cold world, and how this sleepy town, locked in time and beauty and its own atmosphere responds to it in its own way. However saying JUST this is sacrilege and I am doing no justice to the masterpiece whatsoever.<br/><br/>The key is atmosphere.<br/><br/>Take the never-ending cold bleak landscape starkly contrasted with constantly dripping bright red blood. This captures the mood of the film in such eloquence, that little else need be said. Killers, victims, accidents, cops and corpses, all converge on this little known town's highway, and what fate is doled out to everyone is juxtaposed against this brilliant backdrop as a silhouette, almost like the senseless bloodbath and atrocious accidents that occur plus all the deft detective work are means to this end, somehow adding up to the white expanse as an answer. To me, this concept is nothing short of fantastic.<br/><br/>And then, the cast. Frances McDormand is undoubtedly the crowning glory of the whole piece as far as characters go, a striking picture that can be conjured up in an instant in memory - contained, affected, with a singsong accent and very pregnant. Everything she goes about is so characteristic - her pace, her actions and the way she emotes is all reminiscent of the cold and sleepy bleakness around her, and makes a sharp impression in the whole experience. In a way, one could say she seamlessly blends into the atmosphere and is like one born of it, furthering it in its own slow grinding way. Also deserving an honourable mention is Steve Buscemi, in a perfect portrayal of an agent fruitlessly battling against the natural order and shape of things - a perfect example of how small irregularities in this ingrown world have a way of ironing themselves out. He plans; he plots but ends up in a wood chipper, while the snow engulfs all.<br/><br/>But one of the most effective and mind-blowing aspects of the film is the soundtrack. It is pretty much evident how much background score contributes to the totality of a film, and I have always been a believer in soundtracks that have different versions of a predominant motif which serve as the signature for the film, rather than an eclectic mix of contemporary music. A good soundtrack is something that evokes powerful snapshots from the film when it plays in your mind. For me, the distinctive, haunting bleak bagpipe like slow rendition of the Norweigian folk song ""The Lost Sheep"", or natively ""Den Bortkomne Sauen"" is the landscape, the mood, the events - everything. The film artistically keeps returning to the piece in a way that leaves an indelible impression. It is like topping, a summary, everything you wanted to say about Fargo. And boy, how it does hit the final nail in the coffin...<br/><br/>The picture in my mind when I hear it is that of the lone car driving away into the vastness of snow on the highway. That's when things are done and resolved, and all is said and understood.<br/><br/>~cinecopia.wordpress.com"

","No matter where you start to explain Fargo, it's hard to begin anywhere without ""original"" being present in the definition. The Coen Brothers constructed interesting films before Fargo, but this is what really pushed them to the top of the movie world ""food chain"" per se and established them as landmark filmmakers. The editing, directing, and writing is molded with a specific vision that is fulfilled on screen.<br/><br/>The funny one-liners, repetition amongst characters, and the squeaking accents do draw laughs, but they hardly do justice for the film's originality and brilliance. It's a relatively ordinary setting and characters that are stretched out into a plot that would goes under the microscope and explored in the story in more detail than most films would for this simple set up. Then, once the Coens supply a huge shell to fill with a story, they form a bizarre, satisfying storyline that grows its own mind after taking off in Act 1.<br/><br/>A misconception that viewers have about the cinematography of movies is the mise-en-scene has to be visually beautiful, assumed to be found in fantasy films and period pieces. Fargo covers territory of regular landscapes and they are beautiful in themselves, but each shot is thought up and executed to carefully capture something specific. When the cinematography is matched with the near-perfect editing, masterful mise-en-scene results.<br/><br/>The supporting characters in Fargo think they have the simple situations they create under control, but the only character who really has a clue is the protagonist (introduced in an unconventional manner), splendidly created by Frances McDormand. In every performance by an actor in film, though all creatively their own, traces from past films often inspire the actors to make certain choices. In the skin of Marge, McDormand doesn't rely on inspiration, she relies on her own creativity.<br/><br/>Every character is appropriately acted and drawn out to their full potential, I'm satisfied with everyone's development. William H. Macy humanizes his questionable character with quality to note. I've seen Fargo a good number of times, I've always been aware that it's a great, original film, but I never lived it as I did this past viewing. What other film could you sit through a storyline rooted in stupidity besides Fargo?<br/><br/>Rating: 10<br/><br/>Grade: A+"

","This is basically Coen brothers classic breakthrough film. And the story is superbly put together and crafted so well. To the point it makes it one of the top crime films that is a must watch. It's a serious crime story shown in a subtle and yet engaging manner, with slight awkward humor in it. But still stays consistent as a cold story about greed and the distances some people would go for their ambitions. Like the incompetence of the criminals and how it leads them from one mistake to another, one trouble to another. And innocent people gets involved one after another, because of dumb ideas. However, although this story takes place in a dry and boring snowy town. It's kinda amazing how the Coen brothers could pull off naive and dense characters that are actually still believable, while also entertaining to watch. And when it comes down to it, the mannerisms and the demeanor of the characters is what really drives this movie. And the Coen brothers just nails and makes these awkward characters to be intriguing, because of the random and yet believable decisions they make. This is one of those movies that could have fell flat, but thanks to Coen brothers trademark directions. Thus it's amusing and even intriguing at times, because of the random and yet witty and clever storytelling. Overall this is a film with a dry and boring setting, with awkward and yet dull characters that is really worth seeing.<br/><br/>8.6/10"
"antagonist117","10","0","0","22 August 2013"," On Marge's pregnancy
","Marge Gunderson's pregnancy is seldom acknowledged in ""Fargo,"" but a critical review almost has to mention it. It's a notable fact because, in moviedom, pregnancies are usually used symbolically or to raise the stakes. Audiences may react more strongly to things that happen to a pregnant woman than a non-pregnant woman, and screenwriters can generate quick, cheap pathos with a childbirth scene. But that's not what Joel and Ethan Coen do in ""Fargo"", and viewers may be forgiven for occasionally forgetting that the heroine is pregnant at all. It is only referenced lightly and in passing: a sight gag about how much buffet food she's eating, for example, or a tossed-off pretense for her to take a seat across from a potential suspect. The pregnancy doesn't limit her ability to do police work, and it doesn't mark her as undesirable to a man who wants to rekindle an old relationship. It may as well not be there, but it is there, and that makes it an interesting decision by the brothers Coen, who have too keen eyes for details to have done it absentmindedly. By rejecting the typical purposes of pregnancy in film, they show, perhaps, that it need have no special meaning; Marge is a cop investigating a triple homicide in a small Midwestern town, and that's all we really need to know. Whether she's pregnant or drinks coffee or eats eggs are just details."
"sddavis63","7","0","0","18 August 2013"," This Is One Bloody Funny Movie. Sher Is. Yaaaaah!
","OK. So this opens with a claim that it's based on a true story - supposedly actual events that occurred in Minnesota in 1987. But it turns out that the Coen brothers (directors Joel and Ethan) were lying. This isn't actually based on true events, although the Coens claim that the movie is actually a kind of composite story, weaving together strands from various cases. Usually, that kind of dishonesty would bother me, but in this case it was a relief. Frankly, this is a very violent and bloody movie - and yet at the same time it's also very funny. To be honest I'd have been upset with myself for being so amused by a movie that featured so much carnage if it actually had been true!<br/><br/>The story revolves around the kidnapping of Jean Lundegaard (Kristin Rudrud) - the kidnapping having been planned by her husband Jerry (William H. Macy). Jerry's in some sort of financial bind - although it's never really explained what the bind is. He needs money, and to get it he arranges for his wife's kidnapping so that his wealthy father-in- law will pay a ransom, which will then be split between the kidnappers and Jerry. Problem solved, with nobody really being hurt. But things go horribly wrong, people start being murdered, and everything spirals completely out of control. Finally local police chief Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) gets involved and starts putting the pieces together, while everyone involved gets more and more frantic.<br/><br/>This is well paced, violent and very, very funny at times. The characters are given life by a very talented cast (McDormand won an Oscar for Best Lead Actress.) Much of the humour revolves around the portrayal of the local dialect in Brainerd, Minnesota. Yaaaah. That was funny fer sher. Yaaaah.<br/><br/>I forgive the Coen brothers. It's actually good that this wasn't really based on a true story. It makes the movie easier to laugh at. (7/10)."
"Al_The_Strange","8","0","0","15 August 2013"," Fargo review
","This is probably one of the most bittersweet pictures I've seen. Bitter, because I always felt it's a rather bleak and disturbing affair, but rendered sweet thanks to the colorful group of characters and their amusing banter (which is nicely emphasized with all those accents they have there, don'tcha know?). Parts of this film are pretty amusing, but parts of it are pretty sad. The whole affair is a funny-but-sad case.<br/><br/>This story is pieced together from a couple of real-life cases, but populated with fictional characters. It's a pretty simple set-up: a man arranges to have his own wife kidnapped, hoping to weasel money from her father in the form of a ransom. What should be a simple and painless situation becomes a total disaster, because nearly every character thinks they know what they're doing and they think they're so hot, but they're all really inept. A series of mishaps and bad decisions causes a cascade of murders and a rather tragic outcome. Well, heck, the final scene is one of the bloodiest and messed-up things conceivable. As crazy and funny as it is to see things deteriorate over stupid mistakes, it is a sobering reflection on crime, greed, and humanity overall. I think the cop sums it up well at the end, for after running through the situation, she asks, ""and for what? For a little bit of money. There's more to life than a little money, ya know. Dontcha know that?"" All that being said, I feel the story does take one too many random tangents. A lot of screen time is spent on the cop's personal life, which never really has much relevance to the case. I suppose it's perfect for showing a little more humanity on screen, and to contrast directly with the other guy's family. However, I do believe these extraneous scenes slow down the pacing a lot, and sidetracks from the main story.<br/><br/>This film has good, straightforward photography and editing. Acting is effectively perfect from the whole cast, and the writing is good. This production uses very real-looking sets, props, costumes, and locales. Carter Burwell's music score is haunting, dramatic, and beautiful all at once.<br/><br/>This film has garnered its share of acclaim for darn good reasons. I always believed it could be a tighter film, but it is still well worth seeing for its great cast, its distinctive dialogue (complete with accents), and its ability to instill feelings of amusement and sorrow.<br/><br/>Recommended.<br/><br/>4/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Good | Film: Very Good)"

","The Coen brothers really deliver this time with Fargo, a murder story with quirky overtones and a flawless script that really sells the character interaction in an otherworld reality of sorts. Don't write the acting off for no 'big names', the actors all play their roles to perfection and sell the script with their excellent delivery of at times almost comical lines that still fit in with the dark drama atmosphere which gives it an undeniable creep factor. Stripped down Fargo is still a crime drama but it is one done right. With stellar acting and a script to match it adds a quirky creep to the dark story. Everything fits together in a world unfamiliar yet normal in this homespun murder story."
"Scizor2120","9","0","0","1 August 2013"," An exquisite example of superior film making
","Fargo is a film a film by the Coen brothers, Joel and Ethan Coen. The film is about the a very simple crime going horribly wrong. The film opens with Jerry Lundegaard, played by William H. Macy, entering into an arrangement with Carl Showalter, played by Steve Buscemi, and Gaear Grimsrud, played by Peter Stormare. The arrangement is for Carl and Gaear to abduct Jerry's wife, Jean, and hold her for ransom. The deal is supposed to involve no violence, and they are told they will get $40,000 in addition to a brand new vehicle. This should be a fairly simple plan, as Jean's father clearly has the means to pay the ransom, but this simple plan goes horribly wrong.<br/><br/>This movie, as almost all, has multiple themes. Jerry's problems all develop due to his spinelessness, ineffectiveness, and general inability to appreciate the consequences of his actions. One of the themes of the film is that there are consequences of hiding sin. Jerry has a serious embezzling problem, and frankly it is never explained where he is spending this enormous sum of money. The movie elaborate that he is in immediate need of at least $320,000 due to GMAC discovering money he stole. Instead of taking responsibility for his actions, he constructs this insane plan to have Carl and Gaear kidnap his wife and hold her hostage to get his father-in-law's money. Jerry is so ineffective that he doesn't even show up on-time for his meeting with Carl and Gaear. Instead of admitting to his father-in-law that he stole $320,000, he tries to arrange a real-estate deal with him. Instead of planning through this business deal properly, his father-in-law assumes Jerry just wants a finder's fee for bringing the deal to him. This is further proof of Jerry's extreme spinelessness and ineptness Jerry is so incompetent that he fails to talk his father out of dropping off the money to the kidnappers. This is a disastrous consequence that results from the fact that he is concealing the theft of the money and his plan to cover up the theft. Jerry's entire plan for the crime was to take $1 million from his father-in-law, and give the kidnappers he hired $80,000. This idea is completely ruined when his father-in-law takes the money to the kidnappers instead of Jerry. Jerry further causes pain by ineptly allowing Wade to go through with this. The consequence of this is that Wade is killed by Carl, and an innocent parking lot attendant. These are direct consequences of Jerry being a bungling fool.<br/><br/>The further theme of the film is that sin quickly escalates into greater sin. Carl and Gaear are engaged in the crime of kidnapping Jerry's wife, and they quickly escalate this. The initial choice to take part in this evil activity causes a state trooper to stop them. Gaear then kills the state trooper, but there are witnesses to this that unluckily decided to drive by at the wrong time. Gaear then kills those witnesses. Thus, what starts as a simple non-violent abduction turns into a triple homicide. This is just the beginning of the cycle. The triple homicide creates further despair when Carl kills Wade and the parking lot attendant. This shows the continuing cycle of crime creating more crime. The cycle continues when Gaear kills Jerry's wife and Carl. This cycle of crime creating more crime doesn't stop until Marge, a police officer, confronts Gaear as he is stuffing Carl into a wood chipper. <br/><br/>Overall, this film is quite strong. It shows a superior effort went into the film. It is very effective at conveying its message. It is well directed, well edited, and highly effective. On the negative side, I question the point of hiding Jerry's motive for stealing all of this money. Explaining his scheme to steal money from GMAC would also be appreciated. This film is only 98 minutes long, and thus, has more than sufficient time to explain Jerry's motive for stealing this money. I do not see how this helps accomplish the film's ultimate intent. Other than that, I would say it is a very strong film. Overall, I would rate it a 9 out of 10."

Our local car salesman needs cash bad,, but instead of simply asking his father-in-law he decides to hook up with these two well we say bumbling idiots to try and kidnap his wife in hopes that his father in law will pay a very handsome randsom. this movie has so many plot twists and turns , and wow the chipper/shredder scene never ever seen someone get killed that way,, what a horrible way to go if you ask me.. the characters in this movie are memorable, there aren't many movies today that I can get tired watching, I can watch this one over and over and never tire of it..

","Fargo is one of the greatest films ever made,a Classic Masterpiece of cinema that mixes Crime Drama and Black Comedy. Filled with brilliant direction,a great cast,a wonderful script,beautiful photography and an unforgettable haunting score,Fargo is The Coen Brothers and filmmaking at it's best.<br/><br/>Set in Minnesota 1987 and Based on a True story,Fargo tells the story of Jerry Lundegaard(William H. Macy),a used car salesman who is now in debt and owes money. Feeling desperate,Jerry hires criminals Carl Showalter(Steve Buscemi)and Gaear Grimsrud(Peter Stormare)to kidnap Jerry's wife Jean Lundegaard(Kristen Ruddrud)for ransom. But when things go wrong and people are killed,Jerry,Carl and Gaear and the killings are being investigated by pregnant cop Marge Gunderson(Francis McDormand)and things become more chaotic and out of control.<br/><br/>Fargo is an unforgettable Classic Masterpiece that came out at the right time for The Coen Brothers. After the critical and Box Office failure of their hilarious and underrated big budgeted period Comedy The Hudsucker Proxy,The Coen Brothers decided to return to the low budget roots of their first film Blood Simple and make Fargo an amazing film that was critically acclaimed,won multiple film awards and became one of The Coen Brothers career defining and greatest films. Fargo is one of the reason that cinema and filmmaking is such a great art form because Fargo right from the start gives you a film that will have you glued to the screen with it's themes of greed,death and violence and the themes and film experience for Fargo never loses it's power after the film is over. What also makes Fargo an incredible film is it's great mixture of Crime Drama with Black Comedy mixing serious things like murder and kidnapping and combing it with morbid Humor because The Coens are masters at taking serious things that are not supposed to be funny and making them hilarious. The Black Comedy in this film is very funny,surprising and unexpected whether it's the films characters their dialog or the situations the characters are involved in and the Comedy is original and bleak and you will never look at the Midwest the same way again. The Cinematography by Roger Deakins is beautiful,haunting and effective giving the Midwest and Minessota a great scenery and wide landscape despite all of the truly horrible things going on throughout the film. Deakins amazing and flawless photography also makes the snow and Winter atmosphere just come off the screen and when a character is walking in the snow or the cold you as the viewer feel like you are right there in the snow. Marge Gunderson is a great character and maybe one of the greatest and most interesting and fascinating characters in film history because she's so likable and optimistic and loves her job as a cop. You would figure with her being big and pregnant that Marge would take a vacation off but Marge continues to do her job like it's nothing. What I also love about the Marge character is that the film shows two sides of her in the film her personal life as a wife dealing with pregnancy and loving her husband and her professional life as a cop and her professional life comes into play with this film. When the violence and death happen all around under Marge's nose she cannot understand why all of this violence is happening. Marge's optimism view is an interesting contrast to the Horror,danger and violence happening in throughout the film. Marge is another classic creation from The Coen Brothers. The quotable screenplay by Joel and Ethan Coen(which won the Oscar for best original screenplay)is outstanding and perfect,with The Coens giving each of the films main characters funny and memorable dialog and using Minnesota language and dialect/accents and words like yeah(or 'Yah')and quotes such as ""you betcha"" over and over again. Another great screenplay by The Coens. The violence in Fargo is harsh,brutal shocking,disturbing and at times darkly funny and matches the films grim tone and will definitely surprise viewers. The ending of the film sad,disturbing and at the same time hopeful and optimistic especially hopeful for the character Marge. A wonderful ending.<br/><br/>The whole cast in the film is brilliant. Francis McDormand earn a Best Actress Oscar for her excellent performance as Marge Gunderson,with McDormand bring optimism,humor and great depth to the role. A great performance. William H. Macy is wonderful as Jerry Lundegaard,a car sales man in debt. Steve Buscemi is fantastic as Carl,a fast talking criminal. Peter Stormare is great and intense as Gaear,Carl's partner that's a man of few words. Harve Presnall is amazing and funny as Wade Gustafson,Jean's Father. Kristin Ruddud(Jean Lundegaard),Larry Brandenburg(Stan Grossman),John Carroll Lynch(Norm Gunderson),Steve Reevis(Shep Proudfoot),Steve Park(Mike Yanagita)and Tony Denman(Scotty Lundegaard)give good performances as well.<br/><br/>The Direction by The Coen Brothers is brilliant and masterful,with The Coens always moving the camera with close-ups,zooms,over head and shooting from the snow filled roads from a distance giving the film beautiful visual style. Great direction by The Coens.<br/><br/>The score by Carter Burwell is amazing,powerful,epic and intense and matches the film's tone and every scene in the film. A mesmerizing score from Burwell.<br/><br/>In final word,if you love The Coen Brothers,Crime Dramas,Black Comedies or films in general,I highly suggest you see Fargo,a brilliant and flawless Classic Masterpiece of cinema that you can watch again and again and deserves to be in any film lover's collection. Highly Recommend. 10/10."
"Sonic_Ocean","10","0","0","20 June 2013"," Cold, Sterile and Morbid
","I really don't know what from the film the Coen brothers claim is true or could be juxtaposed with actual happenings or actual people, but to comprehend that really does not take away from Fargo being a great movie, whether how true or fictitious it is. When a financially troubled car salesman hires and makes a deal with two people to kidnap his wife as a ruse to get his wealthy father-in-law to cough up money, you can already predict that something could go wrong, especially when these two people aren't the most professional.<br/><br/>While the movie can be oddly humorous, it really adds a strange dynamic effect when coupled with its winter setting, in that it gives a sense of desolation that is reflected in Jerry Lundegaard's life and really adds a lot more weight to the morbidity that carries on and escalates throughout the beginning of the film to the end. Fargo feels like a very morbid movie to me, but to add in some of the most quirky humor really makes the movie feel very idiosyncratic in that it seems incomparable to other films, with all of its distinct characters and its very strange, cold and sterile atmosphere. While Pulp Fiction does do a good job of combining humor and morbidity, I think I have come to favor Fargo a lot more.<br/><br/>What I love about Fargo is how distinct every major character is in the movie. The writing that went into him, coupled with each actor being able to breathe life into their character and giving them their own unique quirks was one of the things that kept me glued to the screen. From the mild mannered behaviors to the Minnesota accents, the characters come off very authentic in presenting a very regional film. If I would have to give a nod to any one performance in the film, it would have to be Frances McDormand. From her mild mannerisms to her unintentional humor, Marge was the foundation of the story and McDormand further accentuated that with her superb acting in that she makes her portrayal feel so authentic to its region, believable and at the utmost, human. To witness all the events in the film and to react the way she did is commendable, to say the least and I think that Marge Gunderson has got to be one of the coolest female characters on film that I have witnessed and I cannot praise the Coen brothers enough for writing such a great non-stereotypical female character.<br/><br/>Fargo may be a simple story, but I think that it's simplicity is what I really love about this film. I watched enough films from the Coen brothers to deem them as very unique in their style of telling stories that feels so different from other directors. Fargo basically sealed the deal for me. With its unique characteristics, it feels very surreal in a morbid sense. I have never described a film that way and I think that shows how special this film is. If you want to watch a film that has character, then watch 'Fargo,' because it definitely has a whole bunch of that."

The first time you'll watch it you'll be captivated by the story which seams unbelievable yet so credible. But after that you'll get to enjoy that great characters that the Coens managed to create. I'll tell you one thing, Marge (Frances McDormand) is one hell of a woman. The toughest boss of the movie.

","Soon at the beginning of the film we see the phrase ""based on a true story."" After watching it, I made a large network research about the history and I didn't found anything. Only later I realized that it was just the first joke of the movie..... HA.<br/><br/>The story is set in 1987 at Fargo, in North Dakota. When Jerry Lundegaard (William H.

Then, he plans the kidnapping of his wife Jean Lundegaard (Kristin Rudrud) and makes an agreement with two marginal. The unnerved Carl Showalter (Steve Buscemi) and the sinister Gaear Grimsrud (Peter Stormare), where both would win a new car and half of the $ 80,000 that would be paid by the father of Jean, Wade Gustafson (Harve Presnell), an arrogant and stubborn rich man. But a series of unforeseen events, it creates just the beginning of a triple murder. And the a pregnant police chief Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) tries to solve the case, which continues to cause more deaths.<br/><br/>The beginning of the film, there is the certainty that the viewer is facing a drama. What it is, only with black humor from beginning to end, with the Coen style. For some that it is the first time watching from the Coens it may seem really weird, but who is already accustomed with, it may be facing a small masterpiece. It was with this film that the world saw the talent of these two brothers who can write a black comedy based on a drama. Very entertaining and intriguing from the very beginning and a agonizing and exhilarating soundtrack. The strongest point of the film is that not only focuses attention on the line of murders but also with all the characters around her. Leaving them quite fun and relatable, each with fantastic performances.<br/><br/>Frances McDormand is superb and fully deserved her Oscar; William H. Macy as well with a superb performance. At the beginning I didn't look like much of his performance, but over the film he manages to deliver a performance worthy of a nomination. But the biggest surprise of the film in the level of performance was truly Peter Stormare with its sinister character. Making a marginal and intriguing look, putting the viewer almost close to a lunatic.<br/><br/>A real small masterpiece from the Coens. Very entertaining and intriguing from start to finish with really well written characters, all with hell-of a performances.

","Fargo is why I love movies. It is dark, funny, exquisitely scored and features some of the best acting performances I have ever seen. I will not give any spoilers to those who have not been fortunate to catch this classic, but watching the caper unfold and progressively get worse and worse is one of the most arresting experiences I have ever had in cinema. The plot revolves around Jerry Lundergard (Macy) hiring two thugs (Beschemi and Stormare) to kidnap his wife. He plans then to get the ransom from his over-powering father in-law and escape the crushing debt of both financial and emotional proportions. Of course nothing goes as planned and the caper takes deeper and darker turns. If you are a fan of the Coen Brothers I would put this at the top of the list!"

","I saw this film with my wife just after we were married but not yet had kids. We saw quite a few very good films during that 2/3 year period. This certainly is up there with the best! I would recommend this to anyone who likes slightly offbeat films with a few twists along the way. William H Macey and Frances McDormand in particular give superb performances. It is a typical Coen brothers effort, actually it is one of their best in my opinion. Although it states in the titles that this was a true story I don't believe that it actually was. However it is a very entertaining if slightly unbelievable story. Go and see it but not if you are squeamish!"

","I really didn't know what to expect when I started watching Fargo, but was unprepared for the romping ride it took me on; Only after I watched the movie and found out that its a Coen brothers movie did I go - ahhh... that explains so much.<br/><br/>The casting of the movie is near perfect with William H Macy as Jerry, the classic bungler who triggers the tragedy of errors that ensue as he hires a couple of small time crooks to fake kidnap his wife, but really the show belongs to Frances McDormand as Marge - the police chief of a small town in the mid-west. Oh - and yes, the obligatory casting of the ever stellar, Steve Buscemi (really - why is he not in every movie?).<br/><br/>Based on true events (edit: just found out that the term is very loosely used here), the movie is set in mid-west, USA and the Coen brothers make full use of this happy occurrence. The residents of a small town have their comfortable routine of shoveling snow - which, going be recent reports, is pretty much all one does in Minnesota - disturbed by a triple homicide by out of town criminals. Disturbed is an over statement as it doesn't bother them enough to even spit out the gum that they've been chewing for a week; Led by the heavily pregnant police chief - Marge. Oh Marge - Luckily this movie was before Christopher Waltz came and was not made by QT else Chris would have been all over the role even it meant being a pregnant man, but I diverge - Luckily, Marge is played by Frances who knocks it out with aplomb. All charm and ma'am but cold steel when required.<br/><br/>The Coen brother tradition of characters dying unceremoniously out of turn is celebrated in Fargo as well. See, this is what i like about Tarantino and Coen brothers type of movies - not only are they memorable in whole but even their constituent pieces are individually remarkable. There is a sense of celebration of the art of making cinema; It has an artistic purity. But - I diverge again. Where were we ? Ah yes - The camera work is fresh and the dialogue indulgent with some hilarious extended exchanges conducted only in varying intonations of the word - ""Yeah"". Even if you haven't spent time in Minnesota, as I strangely have, it is still bloody funny to watch.<br/><br/>This then, truly is a delicious concoction - parts Coen brother zaniness, parts Tarantano'ish violent indulgence, on a base of a Guy Ritchie plot of criminal incompetence, completed with superb performances and inspired casting."

","I've caught a glimpse of Fargo on TV and i decided not to watch it half way through but really enjoy it from beginning to the end. And i loved it. The most amazing thing here are the always lovable characters. You're gonna commiserate with those who are lost and find sympathy in those most crooked. They are all well casted, perfectly played and most importantly real. the dialogue is what keeps this movie witty till the end. The little exchange of words between the characters is amazingly written. what starts off as a well thought out plan spins out of control very quickly but it wont catch you off guard. its a movie definitely worth watching for all its traits- writing, directing, characters, dialogue, the cold scenery. its one of those movies that leave you with a feeling of time well spent and art very much enjoyably consumed."

","The film, if not entirely but to a large extent relies upon its plot. The screenplay is engaging till the end. The acting is good by all and extraordinary by some are some of those reasons why the film is one of the best. The story of the film which revolves around a kidnapping case which started to take unexpected turns is without any flaw. It is darkly funny at times. The actors have done it very smoothly. The setting, cinematography, and cast everything has been good in the film. The brothers have taken the advantage in the beginning by saying that the story is taken from a real incident, thus making the audience more cautious and interested. The story has a number of twists. Performance by Francis Mcdormand as Margie is one of the exciting parts of the film. Her acting is the major force behind the darkly comic nature of the film. The film is not to be missed by any film goer.<br/><br/>MESSAGE: ""Things never go according to the plan.""<br/><br/>VERDICT: ""A must watch film."""
"classicalsteve","9","0","0","3 February 2013"," Brilliant But Brutal Crime Noir Set in the Quaint North-Midwest
","This Coen Brothers offering, one of their best, seems partially about two worlds juxtaposed. The setting is basically the cold and quiet places of the North Midwest. The people here are friendly, congenial, and basically trustworthy, very different from folk in cities in warm-weather climates. Darker urban-crime-like forces infiltrate these quaint and unassuming towns, roads and lakes.<br/><br/>The main plot surrounds the hair-brained idea of a down-on-his-luck car salesman-manager in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Jerry Lundegaard played very convincingly by William Macy, to have his wife kidnapped. His wife's father is wealthy, and even owns the car dealership where he works. Lundegaard believes his father-in-law will put up $1 million as a ransom. However, Lundegaard will keep most of the money and give only a fraction to the kidnappers, as payment for services rendered.<br/><br/>But, as it turns out, the two guys hired by Lundegaard, played with right-on-the-money deadpan by Peter Stormare and Steve Buscemi, are inept low-life incompetents who are about as professional at engaging in criminal services-for-higher as a Texan would be at ice fishing. They stop at motels and hire prostitutes without realizing they could be traced if anything goes wrong. Buscemi's character constantly shoots off his mouth, unconcerned that it might draw unneeded attention. And the ""silent"" mute-like partner, who has less lines than the Terminator, is gun crazy.<br/><br/>From the get-go Lundegaard also doesn't have all the cards in the game of life. He's a rather sleazy car salesman, telling potential buyers an out-the-door price on the phone, then tries to gouge them for more money when they come in to buy the car. And he has somehow ""loaned"" himself car dealership money from erroneous sales. But it doesn't end there.<br/><br/>Lundegaard gives the thugs a brand new car from his dealership which will be engaged in the plan, but he forgets to take off the dealer plates, use other license plates, and place tags on the plates. As car sales manager, you'd think he'd know better but Lundegaard is obviously not as quick witted as the thugs he hires. This error turns out to be crucial in determining how events unfold when at a turning point in the film, a local cop stops the thugs in the car because of its faulty tags. Thereafter, nothing goes as planned for Lundegaard, his wife, his father-in-law or the two thugs when Marge Gunderson, a detective from Brainert played by Frances McDormand in an academy-award winning performance, begins investigating the case.<br/><br/>Fargo is a kind of urban meets rural noir. Unlike other urban noir by the likes of the Coen Brothers, Quinten Tarantino, and others, the pace of Fargo is more slow moving. We see panned shots of exteriors and interiors with references to the environments where these people reside. Long snow-clad fields, lakes, and trees. Paintings of loons and other wildlife adorn some of the interiors. The people are helpful but low-key, sometimes talking about a coming storm. In this beautiful white landscape, red blood stains the snow."

","The Coens reign in their penchant for stylisation in Fargo. The story is told in a pretty straightforward way, they let the characters drive the film. This is a good decision on their part as both the writing and acting are superb, while the pacing is great. It's part comedy, part crime film. And completely successful at both. If I never knew differently I would have easily believed that this was an adaption of an Elmore Leonard novel.<br/><br/>There's no doubt that the crime genre brings out the best in the Coens. The labyrinthine plotting and complex character connections of these films allows these guys to display their mastery. In Fargo, a crime does not go to plan and spirals into something else and no one knows what the others are up to. This is extremely similar to the plot framework of the Coens debut Blood Simple. Fargo is in some ways a reworking of elements of that film but with a wider palette. Where it deviates most is in its inclusion of a lot of comedy. But unlike most straight comedies the humour is very funny here. Most of it is derived from the well-constructed characters but perhaps the funniest single moment is a sight gag - Jerry has a solemn talk with his son about keeping quiet about the kidnapping emphasising further what a weasel he is, he then shuts his son's bedroom door to reveal a hilarious poster of 'The Accordion King'. It's such a bizarre and strange poster for a teenage boy to have in his room. It does indicate though that Jerry's son is maybe a little strange.<br/><br/>As well as being a crime film, Fargo is also a good example of Americana. There is a real sense of place. The small town Minnesota feel is accentuated by the characters, whose specific accents and habits are depicted in some detail here. It reminded me a lot of Twin Peaks, with its mixture of a serious crime with the goings on of ordinary and eccentric small town Americans. The landscape is important too, with the snowy Midwestern expanses beautifully captured.<br/><br/>Like always the Coens somehow get superb performances from their entire cast. The brilliant screenplay helps of course but there is no doubt that the acting is of a very high calibre. Frances McDormand has attracted a lot of deserved praise for her portrayal of a deceptively upbeat pregnant policewoman but this film is full of excellent performances. William H. Macy underpins the story as the pathetic car salesman; it's a terrific performance of a three dimensional character. Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare are great as the out of town hoodlums; Buscemi is particularly good, stealing any scene he is in. While Harve Presnell is also excellent as the no nonsense Wade Gustafson."

","Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) is a car salesman who is convinced that he has a brilliant business plan that will ensure the life of his family, but there is one problem, he needs $ 750,000 that he, of course dosn't have. His wealthy father-in-law has repeatedly refused to help him so Jerry hatches an ingenious plan of kidnapping his own wife, after which he would be richer by $ 960,000 ransom which will be paid by his father-in-law and the kidnappers will get $ 40,000 and a new car that he stole from his own company, while kidnappers (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) are convinced that the total ransom is $ 80.000 and that they are sharing half of profit with Jerry. So, Jerry thought that plan, which includes kidnapping of his wife (which should be done by people unknown to him), car theft in the company he works for, extorting ransom from his father in law, fraud of kidnappers and if all goes according to plan the purchase of a large plot for $ 750.000 dollars and opening a parking is ingenious. But it all went wrong when shortly after making a deal with kidnappers he decided to give up from his plan but could not make a contact with the kidnappers who needed minimum time to turn this easy job into chaos. On the other hand we have Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand), who as head of the district police department is investigating murders that lead her to Jerry and kidnappers. Marge is pregnant, sweet, intelligent and capable police officer who represents typical Minnesota resident. This story about easy non-violent crime that has grown into a bloodbath is presented with a large dose of humor, primarily through caricature characters. Even the description Buscemi's character is funny-looking guy. However, the characters are wonderfully characterized and memorable, just like their dialogues, which are often filmed in one shot what was possible only because of the brilliant acting (especially Frances McDormand, who was also awarded an Oscar for this role) and the phenomenal directing of Joel Coen while his brother Ethan took the role of producer. Although it was said at the beginning of the movie that it was filmed on a true story that is not true, but just a marketing trick by the Coen brothers. The truth is that almost all the events in the film took place in Minnesota in second half of 20. century but separated and unrelated. Coens collected few bizarre stories and urban legends and incorporated them in Fargo, which has become one of the best films ever made. Phenomenal photography, soundtrack that is almost perfect for this story, cold and snowy atmosphere that swallows the viewer, memorable characters, powerful dialogues, brilliant directing and superb acting. Simply, every element of this film is excellent."

","There are two iconic shots toward the end of Fargo, both featuring Peter Stormare's character, the reticent, cold-blooded criminal-for-hire, Grimsrud. The first finds him reacting shockingly to the revelation on a daytime soap opera he's watching that one of the characters is pregnant. The second discovers him, as does the film's very pregnant heroine, Officer Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand), forcing the leg of his newly deceased accomplice, Carl Showalter (Steve Buscemi), through a wood chipper. Both shots are emblematic of the film's continual interweaving of the humorous with the macabre, and both reveal how the black comedy of Fargo, which is as oddly frightening as it is gut-bustingly funny, is achieved. Grimsrud's intent reaction to the soap opera revelation occurs right next to the carelessly discarded, motionless body of his kidnapping victim, Jean Lundegaard, and right before Showalter bursts in with a bullet-torn face. Jean Lundegaard's likely murder and Carl Showalter's facial wound have both resulted from a botched scheme engineered by Jean's hapless husband, Jerry (William H. Macy). Jerry, who looks and speaks like a leprechaun, possesses the qualities of a leprechaun's evil twin; he is as unlucky as he is selfish and stupid. But he has the air of middle-class decency about him; earlier, he joins his wife in earnestly scolding their son for using foul language. Apart from a minor plot (he intends it to be a ""no-rough-stuff type deal"") to kidnap his wife and collect the ransom from his father-in-law, Jerry appears to be the workingman head of a warm, happy household: close, comfy, and cozyâ€”much like the tube sock that still quirkily adorns Carl Showalter's foot, as the rest of his leg grinds its way down into the bloody, snowy abyss beneath the wood chipper. The disturbing violence in Fargo draws additional unsettlement because it disturbs representative objects and scenes of domesticity: soft, comfortable clothes, a routine traffic stop, a suburban parking garage, a housewife knitting while she watches a daytime talk show, and the most representative symbol of domesticity: a proclamation of pregnancy on a daytime soap opera. Like the slightly sub-standard American English dialect spoken by most of its characters and its slightly sub-classical Carter Burwell score, the Coen brothers' slightly off-center crime dramedy works beautifully; Fargo makes us laugh uncomfortably and cringe, as extraordinary crimes infringe on ordinariness. We cringe, but we don't look away; this film is extremely entertaining and, therefore, extremely, though disturbingly, watch-able (and re-watch-able)."

This film is about its characters inability of people to communicate and humanity's greatest vice, a constant desire for more money. A great shot in this film was the extended close-up of her melancholic face after discovering the extent of Mike's lies. This is also when she becomes disillusioned with people, and this only increases as she comes to a face to face later in the movie. This movie is also about more than just people and humanity, its also about violence and how far would someone go for money. The value of life is strongly seen in this movie.

","I feel nobody is smart in this movie. It is different from the crime movies that I have been watched. Normally, they usually have the main character who are smart and fight with bad people. I think the director tries to make the movie is funny by using stupid manner of characters. However, many scenes are cruel, especially the scene that the man kills the police, and many scenes are unpredictable; for example, the scene that kidnapper looks through the window and breaks it out and comes to the house to kidnap. In addition, there is an example of overlapping sound in the scene that the man tries to fix the television. In that scene while the man is fixing the television, the camera is zooming in, and when the television is good, the camera zoom out, but it becomes the different place."

As a pregnant women and having to carry a life in you, but see it being taken away right before your eyes is the most powerful part of the movie. I could go on and on about how making the character of Marge pregnant is what made this such a powerful crime film, but it's really so obvious.Pregnant and all, Marge is still a relatable character to anyone. Another great part of this film was the ascents. Each person did it so well. It's sad that things such as the crime with the Ludengaard's happen for whatever reason commonly.

","Directed by Joel and Francis Coen, Fargo was released in 1996. Set in Fargo, North Dakota, it star William H. Macy as Jerry Lundegaard. Jerry arranges to have his wife kidnapped so his father-in-law will pay the ransom. This is definitely not my type of movie, but it was well done. There were some graphic bloody scenes that are stomach churning. The acting by Macy, Frances McDormand as the police officer and Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare were very well done. <br/><br/>The setting of the movie is a perfect setting for the cold-blooded killings that happened. The movie has what I would call expected gore. For example, as McDormand was creeping up in the woods behind the house and heard the wood chipper going, I wasn't surprised to see the foot sticking out of the chipper (though incredibly gross by the thought of it!).

The combination of comedy and crime was just perfect in this film, the directors balanced the comedy, violence and suspense very well. The movie was not predictable so while I had some idea of what might be coming up next, I was completely sure and it kept me entertained for the duration of the film. The acting done by the whole cast was great each character was extraordinarily normal. The each had their own oddities but also seemed like people that you might run into in your own town. This aided in the comedy relief which was necessary at certain point especially during the wood chipper scene. while it was quite alarming there was one moment that changed the whole scene. Frances McDormand's character is yelling to the man stuffing the body into the wood chipper and when he does look up she point to her hat with expression of shock that the man could be so dumb as to continue after he had noticed her. The camera work also captured my attention. The shots that panned across the desolate landscapes really gave me the feeling of being there. The sudden zooming on character's faces during pivotal scenes sucked me right into the movie and allowed to me to feel what they were feeling. I did not expect too much from this film at first but it really surprised me, I thought it was very well done."

The film has the wonderful mid-west vibe to it which the over exacerbated accents really add too. It adds this great humor to the film which really helps you get through all the slower more informative parts of the film. Not only that but the story it self is all over the place leaving you thinking there no way this simple pregnant women can solve this murder. Yet when it all come together for her you get to really see how she just slowly but surely figure out every little detail to the case.

But overall, it's the pace and in-depth nature and believability of the world that draws you in and rewards multiple viewings; being able to catch subtle character nuances on subsequent screenings is very fun, especially with Coen Bros. movies.<br/><br/>And last but not least, this movie contains two actor-defining roles, as to my mind Steve Buscemi (Carl Showalter) and William H. Macy (Jerry Lundegaard) have never done finer work than they did whilst filming Fargo."

","Fargo is a dark comedy that was directed by the Coen Brothers. This movie is basically about one harmless event that Jerry Lundegaard plans out to get money. He wants his wife kidnapped by two guys because hes to afraid to ask his father in law. Jerry's little idea to get money ends up becoming bigger then he could imagine. Innocent individuals end up getting killed along the way in this small town of Minnesota. In the end Jerry loses everything that was important to him just to get some money. This movie shows the audience that people will think of any ways to get money even though he never meant for anyone to get hurt. I thought this movie was an okay movie."

","The film Fargo from 1996 is a thriller directed by the Coen Brothers. This is not a typical thriller, more a dark comedy, one based on the twisted truths of what one man was ultimately capable of. Jerry's unimaginable decisions when he found himself stuck in a bind illustrate the twisted extremes a human can go to in pursuit of money. Jerry is the executive manager of one his father-in-laws car dealerships. Although his wife comes from a very wealthy family, Jerry does not have the close relationship; one he would need to be able to ask his in-laws for money. When he falls behind on his bills he comes up with the genius idea to have his wife kidnapped so he can cash in on the ransom money. He thinks his plan is fool proof, but it ends up hiring two dangerous men, more dangerous then he could ever imagine. His meeting with Carl and his eerily quiet friend end in multiple homicides, including a state trooper, Jerry's wife, his father-in law and even Carl. Margie, the chief officer involved in the investigating the kidnapping and the other homicides is seven month pregnant. Margie is a simple lady from a small town and she is very good at what she does. Margie suspects Jerry has something to do with his wife's disappearance almost immediately. His nervous twitchy demeanor catches her attention. Fargo is a seemingly slow paced film and builds without the need for dramatic music or the typical serial killer, but is still able to make you jump or squirm. The Coen brothers are brilliant in the way weave different horrible true stories into one amazing film. They show the intensity that a person can feel when they feel trapped in a corner with no way to go. Margie follows the clues and ties together seemingly unrelated events that all tie together in the end. One seemingly controlled act spiraled out of control leaving Jerry with noting in the end."

","The Coen Brothers go along way to catch the essence of what life is like in a town without much crime or power. The acting is flawless with Frances Mcdormand leading the way as a pregnant police chief who is smart enough to see that something out of the ordinary is happening in the country parts of Minnesota. The whole way that the Coen's had Mcdormand and her partner access the murders and go about finding out more about it is absolutely hysterical. I am from Minnesota and many of the characters sounded a lot like the cousins and grandparents I have in the country in Minnesota. The ""you betchas"" and other lines are key to the realism of the film. I truly appreciate the most important part of the film though. The versimilitude and the ability of the Coen Brothers to go to extreme lengths just to show you, that in life in order to be happy and satisfied sometimes you just have to be grateful for what you have. That is why the downfall of the car salesman played by William H. Macy is so disturbing because all he had to do was ask for help and be grateful for the family that was left for him at home. The atmosphere and the depth of shots to show you the wilderness of Minnesota is breathtaking and at times you can almost feel the breeze of the cold Minnesota winter as the movie carries from scene to scene. Overall, this was one hell of a Coen Brothers film and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys dark American comedy."

","'Fargo' is a refreshing film. The audience is thrust into this spoof of a crime movie, full of goofy accents and eccentric charactersâ€”which are oddly spot on to people in real life when you think about it.<br/><br/>These Midwesterners are not all apple pie. They are sinister and complex. The people of small-town Bainerd, Minnesota treat the triple homicide (and growing) nonchalantly. In fact, there are really no hysterics that are expected to accompany a murder spree anywhere in this movie.<br/><br/>The movie makes you question your reaction to things. You laugh during violence and gore and you almost feel guilty for your unusual and 'immoral' reaction. The movie has a quiet beginning, a loud body, and a quiet ending.

The movie is outstanding and consistently intelligent, setting up very complex conflicts that are not directly explained to the audience.

","The Coen Brothers, who are the directors and writers of Fargo did a swell of a job! Both of the Coen Brothers Joel and Ethan were the directors of this film, even though it wasn't credited that way.<br/><br/>The film itself was nicely paced and smooth flowing, making the writing of the script good. I had the opinion though that there were some extra scenes that did not really have any part to the main bases story line. The way the script was plotted it always had you wondering what would happen next in the line of bad happenings.<br/><br/>The camera angles, setting, and lighting had all to do with making Fargo even better. With 180 degree shots, panning, zooming, really caught the settle moments that really triggered emotions.

","Fargo is a dark crime drama. There is some subtle Coen Brothers humor mixed in, but ultimately it's a story about bad people doing a bad thing, and a good cop investigating it. The Coens' masterful direction somehow seems to convey two perspectives at once, as you can clearly see the action through Jerry's (William H. Macy) eyes, but you can also see it through Marge's (Frances McDormand) eyes: two very different viewpoints.<br/><br/>The Minnesota culture in this film adds a lot of charm, and Frances McDormand was wonderful in it. Still, I found it hard to sit through the gruesome violence and the generally evil attitudes of the criminals depicted.

Buscemi and Stormare are hilarious as the kidnappers with opposite personalities. Macy is perfectly cast as the schmuck who hires the kidnappers.

","The beauty of Coen brothers movie making is the lack of exposition - i.e. characters overtly explaining their motivation, intent and even their obvious activity to the typical dim witted moviegoer. Thus the commentaries such as ""lack of plot"" or ""was it a comedy or a drama -or what?"" or ""I don't get it"" are common.<br/><br/>The best movies ever made have little or no exposition - the viewer must interpret what they are seeing. Most movies categorized as ""comedy"", ""drama"", ""love story"" etc... are typically not quality films or they could not be categorized so readily.<br/><br/>Comparing this to Raising Arizona is shameful. Both are excellent - but very different. Most who say the enjoyed Raising Arizona but couldn;t ""get"" Fargo probably didn't ""get"" Raising Arizona either. But there was enough slapstick like comedy and explosions to entertain them.<br/><br/>Not every scene in a movie must move the plot forward. The Coen brothers often utilize seemingly irrelevant scenes (Margie and Mike having lunch, Carl and the hooker at a night club) in their films. These scenes add a sense of reality to the film, real people do not live one track lives but rather have multiple things going on at once.<br/><br/>I loved this film!"

","The movie is funny without trying to be funny. Steve Buscemi,as Carl is the penultimate loser among losers.He is the Laurel and the Iceman is the ultimate Hardy. The humor is in the way the talk comes across like Margie interviewing the two hookers, the cop who was called out by the guy shoveling the snow and the dialog between Carl and the iceman badguy. The few who stand out are Margie and Jerry. Now Jerry(William H. Macy,)is sometimes not convincing (very superficial) in some of the Ransom scenes with his father-in-law but he is a great actor.The humor conceals some of the brutal (supposedly real story that happeneed in Minnesota in 1997)enactments of what happened. The movie is riveting as all good movies are. Even the last few scenes where this petite and pregnant Sheriff has this monster behind barbed wires, are funny and then normnan and Margie cozy up- when he says for the final time ""I love you Margie"" it does't sound so mechanical as Norman had said few times before."

","Fargo is not a straight up thriller. Nor is it a straight up comedy. It is not a drama, a romance, an action flick, or a story of redemption. What makes it so difficult to gauge is that it does not slip easily into one film genre or another. Perhaps that is why I see more threads about Fargo devoted to why this movie rocks or why it sucks than to any other movie. Some people go into it expecting a comedy and are disappointed. Others go in expecting a riveting thriller and also exit displeased. Those who go into this film simply expecting a great movie, however, will leave having watched one of the greatest pieces of art offered in the 1990's.<br/><br/>I generally (but not always) agree with Roger Ebert's reviews and never more so than with his recap of the Coen Brothers' first true masterpiece, Fargo. He says that the movie covered a variety of genres before ultimately emerging as one of the greatest films he'd ever seen. I would have to agree. After being encouraged by a friend to see this movie, I saw it not knowing exactly what to expect. I laughed, I was tense, I sat on the edge of my seat, and I finally ended up rooted to my seat, stunned, as the closing credits rolled. I have not seen The English Patient, the Best Picture winner of 1996, but I doubt it came close to Fargo in cinematic greatness. Please correct me if I am wrong, but it seems to me unlikely that any film of 1996 could have been more original and astounding than Fargo was.<br/><br/>The driving force behind this film is the script. It is at once funny and haunting, set up by a proclamation that the story is ""based on true events"" (not true). As these words appear at the start of the film, followed by the opening scene, you can already see that Fargo is not your run-of-the-mill flick; it is unique. The script is full of twists and turns; I will not spoil them here but suffice to say that a cop pulling over two attempted kidnappers turns a somewhat strange situation into absolute bedlam.<br/><br/>The ""somewhat strange situation"" is that Jerry Lundegard (William H. Macy in an Oscar nominated role) has paid to have his wife kidnapped by two lumbering criminals (Peter Stormare and Steve Buscemi in his best role to date) in order to garner a large ransom from his wealthy father-in-law. Of course, this ludicrous plan goes horribly awry, and the policeman scene mentioned earlier sets off a chain of events that leads to numerous killings. Eventually, the heroine, Police Chief Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand in an Oscar winning role), arrives on the scene to deduce what has happened.<br/><br/>Fargo never lets up for a second. It draws you in from the first scene and yanks you from side to side during its 98 minute running time. The dialogue is pitch perfect, as the Coen Brothers capture their native North Dakotan dialect to a tee, and the script flows seamlessly from one scene to the next. The movie is entertaining from the start but really hits its stride when Marge enters the scene. Three great actors- McDormand, Macy, and Buscemi- are all truly at the top of their form in this film.<br/><br/>Fargo is unlike any movie around. It is a comedy, but it is also a thriller. It is an action movie, but it is also a slow-paced, methodical movie. It rolls a bunch of genres into one. If you asked ten people to describe the movie in one word, you'd almost certainly get ten different responses. Actually, maybe that's not true. They may simply respond with the word ""Fantastic""."

","I re watched Fargo, and I have to say, without giving too much, it is impossible to not LOVE this film! Fargo is such a brilliant piece of film-making! The script was written with such intelligence. It's mixture of black comedy with crime and drama is so original, it is a pity why films like this cannot be done these days. To just explain the greatness of Fargo is not enough. Unlike other 'so called' masterpieces out there, Fargo's genuine emotional appeal cannot be described. It is enough to just watch the film. Yes, it is disturbing, sometimes a little too much, but that mixed in with amazingly memorable characters, makes for a truly amazing ride. It is a simple kidnapping movie, but the way events fold out, and unfold themselves are so bizarre, that it is even original(something that is hard to grasp these days).<br/><br/>A strong part of this film is the acting. William H. Macy plays Jerry Lundegaard, a character that is sometimes mixed with fright and worry, and Macy gives such a well done performance. Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormware are great as the two kidnappers, Buscemi actually giving a performance worthy of an Oscar nomination. But the greatest performance has to come from Frances McDormand, who plays her character of Police Chief Marge Gunderson so well, mixed with quirkiness so well, this is a true landmark for acting. Usually dramatic performances capture scenes, but McDormand captures every scene with her charm. One of the best performances of the 90's. Mixed with the acting are the strong sides to the film. The cinematography is so real and gorgeous, the film editing flawless, the music score so originally made, they all enhance the experience more.<br/><br/>All in all, Fargo is a perfect film. It has a lot of themes inside of it, and they all come out sooner or later. But unlike theme-filled movies, this is a joy to watch. This is what films should be. They should entertain, but also react strongly to the audience and enhance us in different ways. This is Joel and Ethan Coen's best films. There is no way they could beat this. It is just difficult to describe how truly great it is. And unlike most 1990's famous films, Fargo is not overrated in such a way that people call it to be so 'important'. Fargo is, after second thoughts, the best film of the 90's. It is also one of the best films ever made, in the aspect that it is, after all, one little joy of a film! 10/10"

But only the Coehns can answer that.<br/><br/>Each movie try to evokes and entice certain feelings. for me, Fargo, seems to try to contrast the warmth of some characters against the coldness of others, namely the murderers.

","I have a tendency not to compare the Coen brothers to other directors, seeing as they are among the most unique filmmakers in the world, but it is fair to say Fargo is their Pulp Fiction: a work of startling originality (in fact, their first truly original screenplay, rewarded with an Oscar) that showed they could do more than merely revisit classic genres, so brilliant the Academy chose to overlook it (the Best Picture award for 1996 was infamously given to The English Patient). It's a playful, exhilarating and shocking piece of cinema - the brothers' masterpiece.<br/><br/>The film's playfulness is exposed in the very beginning, as the opening caption states ""This is a true story"" (which, of course, it isn't). After that, it's straight into the action: three men talking in a diner. One of them is Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy), a car dealer whose financial troubles have led him to the hiring of the other two, Carl Showalter (Steve Buscemi) and Gaear Grimsrud (Peter Stormare). They are meant to kidnap Jerry's wife and ask his father-in-law Wade Gustafson (Harve Presnell) to pay a ransom which will be split in half between crooks and employer. However, just like in Reservoir Dogs (which also starred Buscemi), the best laid plans get screwed up beyond belief, resulting in a bloodbath that contrasts nicely with the snowy surroundings.<br/><br/>While Carl and Gaear keep getting in trouble and Jerry has to pretend everything is all right, the cops intervene as well; specifically, one cop, Marge Gunderson (the Oscar-winning Frances McDormand, aka Mrs. Joel Coen), whose natural kindness and determination make her the ideal choice for the job despite her being eight months pregnant.<br/><br/>Marge is one of the best film characters of the '90s, and undoubtedly the Coens' finest creation: whereas the protagonists of their previous movies were clever reinterpretations of genre types, she is a flesh-and-blood human being, with real emotions and a heart of gold. Her unique status as the only really good person in the film adds to the several endearing traits of McDormand's humane, warm performance. She is the audience's guide in a darkly humorous universe, populated by dishonest con-men, funny-talking prostitutes (the accents are supposedly of Scandinavian origin) and the psychotic Gaear, played by a career-best Stormare, whose double act with the fast-talking Buscemi adds to the in-joking since he is the only real Scandinavian in a movie full of fake Swedes and Danes (Lundegaard and Gustafson).<br/><br/>The unique setting of the film (apparently, the Coens' home region) plays really well to the brothers' knack for funny names (apart from the ones that have already been mentioned, one should remember that of Marge's husband, Norm ""Son of a"" Gunderson), quirky characters and sudden, brutal violence. The result is a once-in-a-lifetime blend of thriller, comedy and horror movie, the best film of 1996 and a milestone in (post)modern film-making. It may not be a true story, but why nag about that when the Coens' imagination is much more satisfying?"

From here, everything that can go wrong does and we see all that Jerry thought was going to work turns out to come and bit him in the butt.<br/><br/>What really is memorable about this film is not only the great performances by Macy, Frances McDormand, Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare but also the amazing settings the Coens gave themselves to set each scene up to be exactly as they wanted it. Collaborating with the genius that is Roger Deakins, they give us a bleak and ugly landscape that sets the tone for the rest of the story. This is certainly the type of movie perfectly watchable in the dead of winter, especially if you live in an area where snow is constantly looming above.

McDormand definitely deserves her Oscar, although it's a bit tragic that Macy didn't get one, since he gives the better performance (although I emphasize that both performances are spectacular). The film also presents an interesting contrast, with complications, violence, and sin on one side, and simple folksy down-home humanity on the other. It is this contrast that makes ""Fargo"" difficult to categorize. Crime plays a central role in the story and yet it's not a crime story, thriller, or mystery. The scenes with Frances McDormand are laugh-out-loud hilarious (and she is a true master of the art of awkward smiles for awkward moments), and yet the film is not a comedy (not even a black comedy). It's a different kind of film altogether.<br/><br/>And yet, I can't quite join the critics in calling this ""one of the greatest films ever made"" or ""the best film of 1996"" or anything like that. It is a very good movie. The Coen brothers are talented filmmakers. But, when I watched ""Fargo,"" I felt like something was missing. I can't quite put my finger on what, though. There's just some je ne sais quoi that's missing from this film.<br/><br/>Maybe I felt like the link between the violent plot and the comedic plot was not strong enough, that they were connected, but not strongly enough. Maybe I thought the movie was driven too strongly by the characters and not enough by the plot. I usually love character-driven stories more than plot-driven ones. (The character-driven films of Martin Scorsese, especially ""Taxi Driver,"" are probably my favorite films). Yet, maybe I was looking for a bit more plot in ""Fargo."" I really don't know.

Trooper Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) is hot on their trail throughout the film despite being 7 months pregnant.<br/><br/>The music score was top-notch (although I hate using that word).

","I've heard a lot of good things about this particular movie. Having heard that the Coen Brothers made it, I immediately wanted to see it. Boy, did I make a good choice. The writing was spectacular, the acting was great (I love the accents), the direction was masterful; overall, it's a great movie. I especially love Francis McDormand's acting in it. She was great as the heavily pregnant police officer. I love the line ""I think I'm gonna barf."" Plus, I also liked William H. Macy and Steve Buscemi. They did a great job in it as well.<br/><br/>Furthermore, I also digged the scene where Steve Buscemi was being put in a wood-chipper, piece by piece. Oh, it was so disgusting, yet it was so well done. And to hear that this was based on a true story, it shocked me. I never would've expected this to be a true story. Anyway, it's a good movie.

It's the sort of weirdness that happens in real life rather than the all-too-often implausible movies.<br/><br/>We watch a succession of scenes that trail each other like the sets from an opera. Small-town American life in winter in captured with a wonderful phlegmatic simplicity.

But neither have the wit or wisdom to do it right. Steve Buscemi & Peter Stormare play those goons.<br/><br/>Frances McDormand is the WPC who is landed with the job of finding out what's happened. She is neither a graceful nor a pretty woman, and proves once more that females don't need the face and figure of Pamela Anderson to make truly deserving contributions to cinema. Well done, the Coens, for realising this. The little dalliances between herself and her artist husband are touching and funny, and one wonders why other couples cannot be so mutually respectful and accommodating in real life.<br/><br/>The sub-plots are supported by funky theme music that segues each along at an unhurried pace, gradually wandering into weirdness, and contrasting their loving normality to the final nightmarish denouement.<br/><br/>And she tries to make sense of it all in her simple small-town way. It's such a nice sunny day after all. And just for some money...<br/><br/>It's hard to tire of this movie. For all its black humour, it's a personal pleasurable experience.

","How do I even begin to review a film that has been in my personal Top 20 of all time. 'Fargo' is like many Coen brothers films: the story of a stupid crime gone horribly wrong. You can relate it to their Oscar winning film this year 'No COuntry for Old Men' in some ways.<br/><br/>Fargo is arguably the Coen Brother's best movie (though personally I think it's their second-best, after No Country For Old Men). I was pleasantly surprised by the simplicity of the storyline, as many movies concerning crime are often too fast paced and reliant on plot twists. Instead, Fargo's plot develops more through the characters than through what is actually occurring on the screen. The characters themselves, especially Jerry Lundegard, are very well thought out and work in perfect unison with the simplicity of the story. There are no hard-boiled, cynical detectives here, just a simple policewoman who uses basic techniques to outwit her inexperienced counterparts.<br/><br/>Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) is in deep debt after committing some major fraud at his father-in-law's car dealership, so he comes up with a scheme to have his wife kidnapped in order for his wealthy father-in-law to pay the ransom. Unfortunately, the men he hires (Peter Stormare and Steve Buscemi) are not only completely unstable and scary but share a half a brain among them. What was supposed to be a simple kidnapping culminates in the murder of three innocent bystanders. Enter Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) a small-town sheriff, who also happens to be seven months pregnant, who steps in to try to solve the case.<br/><br/>'Fargo' has so many things going for it: Phenomenal acting (McDormand won a well-deserved Oscar for her role) by all players, supporting and lead and a brilliant script that is part mystery, part thriller and part drama and all layered in a thin veneer of some of the darkest comedy seen in recent years, are just two of the outstanding elements. The cinematography of 'Fargo' however is absolutely beautiful. The snow white landscape is so stark and vast; yet suddenly you realize that you are watching a tiny figure in the distance, trudging through the snow; and it's one of the main characters. One shot in particular is so unbelievably framed, that for a good ten seconds, the viewer isn't entirely sure what they are looking at, until it becomes obvious that it is a deserted parking lot with one car parked in the middle of it. Scenes like these are literally breath-taking and hearkens back to some of the beautiful cinematography in one of their earlier films, 'Millers Crossing'.<br/><br/>'Fargo' is one of those movies you watch a dozen times a month then forget about it for a few months. After the few months, you pop it in again and the whole movie is brand new again. I recommend everyone watch this movie even if you are not a Cohen Brothers fan. The great thing about the brothers movies is that even if you don't share their same sense of humor and don't laugh once, the movies they make still hold up with their great stories. But if you do share the same sense of humor, the comedy is just another layer of greatness. Fargo has everything; suspense, a good story, humor, brilliant acting and a score that accompanies the visuals perfectly. Out of my 200+ DVD movies collection, Fargo is one of my most watched (along side my Martin Scorsese collection)."

Examples of this include the bartender's ""crazy down there by the lake"" story, and the infamous wood-chipper scene. The ending is very satisfying, as the bad guys get what they deserve, and life goes on."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","0","0","3 February 2008"," Straightforward but powerful, ""Fargo"" is classic tragedy
","""Fargo"" is one of those crime films that doesn't actual attempt to mislead you anywhere. It doesn't need to rely on Hollywood twists and that's the look of a truly great story.<br/><br/>The film follows the consequences of William H. Macy's character Jerry's choice to hire two men to kidnap his wife so he can pay off other debts. The plot is simply how this spins out of control and turns into something tragic.<br/><br/>Balancing out the tragedy is the simply yet wonderful character of Marge, the pregnant policewoman played by Frances McDormand. She has no dramatic dialogue or scenes that demand a great deal, but she plays her character with such charm and simplicity that she is easily the most likable character in the film. Thematically, it seems as if Marge is representative of honor and hope in how she does her duty with the former and symbolically in her pregnancy for the latter.<br/><br/>The Coen brothers create an aura around this film that seems somewhat contradictory but effective. The snow gives it a distinct feel of innocence, but the blood taints it. You feel like with all the violence, your heart should be racing, but the Coen brothers have shot the film in a way that it simply builds interest and/or concern for the characters in the film. The setting is very subtly of great importance.<br/><br/>""Fargo,"" simply put, is probably one of the greatest tragedies of the modern era, almost Shakespearian in a way in how it probes the mind by showing simple people in a difficult situation."

They capture the dreary scenery of this winter plain-land flawlessly mix the dark humor with a pretty violent story, all the while keeping their tongue firmly planted in their cheek. It pokes fun at these characters and their lifestyle while also creating a magnificent story out of them. You can see that the Coens truly loved these people and put dedication into creating this world (that was inspired by their actual life in Minnesota) and had a lot of fun mocking it all while paying tribute to this sort of sub-culture. The score and cinematography are easily some of the best I've ever seen (as is the film). It's also creepy how much I relate to Gaear Grimsrud. I feel like we have so much in common and were I in his situation I would act the same way. He also managed to draw the most laughs out of me. It should also be mentioned that the performances from the four main actors (McDormand, Macy, Buscemi, Stormare) are all grand. It truly is a film that only gets better and better with each viewing.

","""Fargo"" is the Coen brother's film of a salesman in Fargo, North Dakota that hires two men to kidnap his wife for financial gain and a subsequent police investigation. The story is said to be based on true events with the stipulation that the characterizations are exaggerated for comical effect. The film has an eclectic mix of drama, crime, humor and black humor. The film is well-shot and has an effective score.<br/><br/>The film has solid performances. William H. Macy creates a compelling character as the desperate salesman Jerry Lundegaard. Carl Showalter and Gaear Grimsrud are interesting as the quirky yet dangerous as the kidnappers. Frances McDormand also has a notable turn as the no-nonsense and practical yet simple Marge Gunderson.<br/><br/>The story starts off well and the crime story generally retained my interest. However, I found that the script got diverted at a number of points and was less effective than it could have been. A prime example of this was the scenes related to the character of ""Mike"", which were unnecessary and distracted from the main story. The film's satire of how trite people can be is clever at points, but becomes tedious with repetition. However, Chief Gunderson's speech toward the end of the film was well-written. Unfortunately I didn't find the quality of ""Fargo"" to be up to its reputation despite its positive points."

","I am asking the question myself that how ominous place Minneapolis is. After I had seen the collapse of connection bridge of Minneapolis lastly on TV's, I had chance to watch this film.<br/><br/>-spoiler- The film mainly describes a tragedy that happened in Minnesota in 1987. According to that a car sales manager needs money to found a new job. He chooses an incredible way to obtain the money of the father - also he is his boss - of his wife. He gets in touch with two tramps by means of his master and the facts take progress. I can't explain after that because I don't wanna you to lose your excitement about it.<br/><br/>Such tragic facts exist all around the world. But, I think most of them wouldn't draw attention as Fargo, if they were realized on theaters.<br/><br/>Starting with this natural scenario, I think, the spectators couldn't leave the screen even just one second. The director already created a movie that's harmonious with this scenario.<br/><br/>I think there aren't many words to say for Steve Buscemi. Like always he lets his abilities speak.His appearance exactly fits with the role. But more than him, I admire the performance of his partner who is Peter Stormare as Gaear Grimsrud. Whatever necessary for playing a maniac, he displays and does his best. I think there is an interesting point to talk about it. The leading role players' names remind me Scandinavian people's names. Macy as Jerry Lundegaard, Stormare as Gaear Grimsrud and Presnell as Wade Gustafson are some of them.<br/><br/>-spoiler- The main music continues from starting to end, it is good for action. Effects are also amazing, especially shootings of Grimsrud and sparing his friend's foot in wood carpenter.<br/><br/>Details from film are so interesting. For example Grimsrud isn't very talkative and that fits with his frightening image. Fargo seems as the suburb part of the city where it is located.<br/><br/>After all the comments I made above, the last sentences will be like that: Scenario is so fluent, it makes curious about the end of the film and it is hard to forget.<br/><br/>Fargo rises with Buscemi's and Stormare's fascinating performance and it deserves absolutely nine points."

","Every so often a film comes along that is truly a unique work of a singularly unique story, style and execution as to put it all by itself, unable to be 'classified' and impossible to forget.FARGO(1996)would certainly seem to fit the bill. Just ask 6 people, who've seen it, just what was it about? I mean not just the plot, screenplay or scenario, but what, if any, ""message"" was there? Was there any little bit of true life experience ? Can the viewer relate to it or see anything resembling our own lives? The film opens with little vignettes of two different households. We see the Gundersons, Marge(Frances McDormand) and Norm(John Carroll Lynch). She is the Police Chief of a small Minnesota Town. She is also 7 months along of being ""in a family way."" He is an Artist and apparently a stay at home ""Mr. Mom"" type.<br/><br/>The other household is that of the Lundegaards, Jerry(William H. Macy) and Jean(Kristin Rudrud). He is General Manager of his Father-in Law's Automobile Dealership. Jerry is ambitious and loves the Green $tuff a little too much. He has hopes of advancing up the corporate ladder to some kind of partnership. The Father-in-Law (Harve Presnell)tolerates him but has little use for him, shutting him out on a land deal that was basically the Son-in-Law's brainstorm.<br/><br/>A bizarre idea for a phony kidnapping of his wife in order to collect a Ransom from the Old Man is hatched by Jerry Lundegaard's fertile imagination. Well, it sounds foolproof, no? We'll see.<br/><br/>The of Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare combine to form just about the creepiest pair of psychotic killer-thugs ever. Their mannerisms and demeanor are bad enough by themselves, but when together they become the embodiment of evil. They scared me, I mean gave me the creeps and I was a Chicago Cop for 'bout 34 years, worked in some pretty mean streets, too.<br/><br/>The ""fun"" all begins when the underachiever with all the bad debts closing in on him meets with these two Ghouls, and pitches the idea to them. Then, almost everything goes not according to schedule and puts layers of complications upon other layers, etc, etc.<br/><br/>It has been said that ""If you sleep with Dogs, you'll get Fleas."" This is surely an apt slogan for the whole hair brained, cockamamie plot.<br/><br/>Thre is an affectionate handling of the Minnesota setting and its inhabitants. The Director and Production opted for using local dialect in the speaking of the characters. The Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan Upper Peninsula inhabitants display a marked influence of their Norwegian and Swedish ancestors speech patterns. So much of their accentuation and slang expressions are direct descendants of the old Scandanavian settlers to this part of the Midwestern U.S. as to deserve recognition, with respect and affection. This Film did just that.<br/><br/>But, when looking back at the whole story, once we get to The End title on the screen, we get to see that there is definitely a Morale or two imparted. And after several years and quite a few viewings, I believe that this Shanty Irishman has finally gotten some of its intended bits of wisdoms.<br/><br/>We witness all of this outlandish, totally uncivilized and barbaric behaviour being perpetrated by otherwise peaceful law-abiding middle class, ""decent"" folks. And in this case, we see can the readiness of the Son-in-Law to put his trust in these sociopaths.<br/><br/>And even more ironic of a situation, right under our noses from the beginning is the roles of the Gundersons.

","In terms of character study, this film is only rivaled by a few other movies in the last 30 years. Perhaps ""The Godfather"", maybe ""Patton"" and a very few others would approach a par on level of character study. Each one was superb, and right on cue. The dark comedy timing was excellent, in addition to the extreme nature and behavior of those involved, and of course the flawless flow of the story line.<br/><br/>William Macy's character portrayal makes one despise him immediately, for being an idiotic childish fool (while in real life Macy is an intelligent gentleman); and Frances McDormand's character is priceless as a very sincere, and very ethnic Norwegian cop. These, in addition to the entire cast, make this movie one of the most memorable of all time. The film's presentation is suspenseful, gripping, and entertaining from start to finish, mainly because of the strategy of the story, in addition to the built in environmental effects it possesses. This feel is further emphasized by the musical accompaniment and timing, and fine acting and reacting within a rather provincial setting.<br/><br/>Obviously, part of the comedic aspect of this otherwise horrific story is Macy's incredibly audacious hatched plan to begin with, and then the subsequent abilities of everyone else around him to respond according to his own character. In addition, Jerry Lundgren's behavior carries (and causes) the story's unfolding of events in an unbelievably believable way. But, just out of curiosity, where could one ever find such a collection of extreme personalities and behaviors coincidentally converging on one place at the same time? I suppose something similar happened 11 years later in ""Smokin' Aces"", but in a different context. But even then, that (Smokin' Aces' character development) was not as intriguing.<br/><br/>In addition to McDormand's very deserved Oscar in this film, it is not incomprehensible that Macy, and others, could have or should have received nominations as well. For anyone who hasn't seen a very involving and entertaining movie in a while, buy the DVD of this one. It's a winner in every way."

","""Fargo"" is a true story. Quoting the first writing that comes up on the screen when the movie starts, the events depicted in the film took place in Minnesota 1987, although at the request of the survivors, the names have been changed. Out of respect for the dead, the rest has been told exactly as it occurred. ""Fargo"" tells about a man named Jerry Lundegaard who's in a desperate need of money. So he comes up with an idea to kidnap his own wife, hiring two thugs for the job. Jerry's wife Jean has a father who's rich so the plan is that the father, Wade Gustafson, has to pay the ransom for his daughter, which Jerry will make profit from. Jerry makes a deal with the thugs and carefully plans the whole thing, but things don't go quite as he thought they would.<br/><br/>The amazing thing about this film is that it's really a true story, so what you see from the screen is pretty much what has really happened. It's tragic and it's sad. The screenplay's written by brothers Joel and Ethan Coen and the movie's directed by the other of the two brothers, Joel Coen. What comes to the screenplay, it's very well written, but in my opinion some things could have been left out. I won't go to the details, as I don't want to give away any spoilers. Although there are those unnecessary things in the screenplay, the movie's still very interesting and detailed throughout. Directing has this nice flow, capturing images of cold landscapes, a coldness, giving the movie this darker edge, which is really like this sort of a background essence of the movie. It's pretty hard to explain, but it's important and necessary for the film itself.<br/><br/>William H. Macy plays the role of Jerry Lundegaard and I must say I'm pretty damn impressed of his role performance, one of his best performances yet to date for sure. Macy's one of those actors who can really look believably nervous, which again gives the whole character this huge credibility. His just perfect for the role. Frances McDormand plays the role of a pregnant local police Marge Gunderson, which granted her an Academy Award for the Best Actress in a Leading Role. I agree on the fact that she's amazing in the film, but I really liked Macy's performance much more. There's still one role performance to mention and that is the role of Carl Showalter, other one of the two thugs, which is performed superbly by Steve Buscemi. That is by far Buscemi's best role performance yet to date and I've always honestly thought that Steve's more of a comedian sort of type, but the role of Showalter is a perfect example that he can do drama as well, though the character's is actually hilarious in certain parts of the movie, cooperated nicely by Peter Stormare in the role of the other thug Gaear Grimsrud. Stormare's performance compliments the whole performance of Buscemi, and to me Stormare is always enjoyable, no matter what the role was.<br/><br/>""Fargo"" is, all in all, a great movie. It's thrilling, very well progressing and it's filled with great characters performed by fantastic actors. It is definitely a thriller/drama to watch if you're looking for something consisting of those genres.

","One of the highlights of American 1990s cinema, FARGO has a lean, often violent, but mostly hilarious script, as dazzling as the snow which fills so many of the movie's frames.<br/><br/>Cosy in bed with husband Norm (what a perfect name!), with baby on the way, everything is as it should be for our investigator Marge, unforgettably played by Frances McDormand. Then the phone rings. If it isn't a brutal crime, it's a crazy guy she used to be at school with. Marge finds it all incomprehensible. But out she goes, with seemingly effortless courage, trying to level the world out when it goes off kilter.<br/><br/>There are many echoes of Ealing comedy in the Coen Brothers' work, and FARGO's bungling bad guys could easily have come from the pen of William Rose, who created THE LADYKILLERS. It's no wonder Joel and Ethan went for a remake.<br/><br/>The icing on the FARGO cake is an excellent score by Carter Burwell.<br/><br/>A wonderful movie."

","The first thing you're struck by in this film is the incredible foolishness of the characters. Jerry Lundegard (William H. Macy) is a perfect idiot, devoted to the money, loser and mediocre. Steve Buscemi's character is practically brainless, but we touch the acme with Peter Stormare's character. I've never seen a more boorish person: he never talks, but on the other hand his gun is always in action, and he's particularly cruel with his victims. Luckily there's Marge, the firm and REALLY funny pregnant policewoman played by the wonderful Frances McDormand: she deserved every prize she won and was nominated for.

Everything, from the camera-work down to the plot and the characters is just perfect.<br/><br/>If I have to choose one out of the many, it's the character of Jerry Lundegaard (played by William H. Macy) that really makes this movie stand out among the other crime movies you might have seen.<br/><br/>This guy is so... well... recognizable! OK, he makes up a scheme to kidnap his wife, that's not what a ""normal"" person would do. But he is so recognizable with all his small lies. The funny thing is that every small lie of his comes on top of the big pile of all the other ""small lies"" he made before. At a certain moment, all the small lies combined result in such a big lie that he can only desperately hope to keep it up with his ""acting"". And the ""acting"" in this role is brilliantly done by William H. Macy...<br/><br/>Of course the characters of Marge Gunderson and the two baddies are also nicely done, although I don't think that the baddies here are so much different from other bad guys in other movies.<br/><br/>Also a big thumbs up for the general scenery in this movie. The snowy landscapes feel like they are almost meant to be a direct answer to the classic western-movies that made American cinema famous for a large part.<br/><br/>I'm not American, so I can't give any real opinion on the accent/dialect that is used by the characters. However, even for a non-native speaker, the humour of these characters' accent is clear enough, just because it sounds so different from the ""English"" I was taught at school. You find dialects all over the world. People speaking dialect are often the subject of jokes by others. It's really nice to watch a movie where a certain dialect gets such a prominent place. It reminds me of Trainspotting (only in this respect, though).<br/><br/>I'm giving this movie a 10."

","This is one of those movies that just blows me away every time I watch it. Fargo is truly an amazing accomplishment. As per usual for the Coen brothers, the characters are unique, interesting, well fleshed out, and the dialogue is great. The acting is top notch as well, most notably by Buscemi and McDormand, although the rest of the cast is great as well. The thing that elevates this movie above most others I think, is how smoothly it alternates between the comic and the tragic. The dialogue is filled with great comic moments only to all of a sudden shift to a dark and gruesome scene and then right back to the comic. The Coen brothers are my favorite directors and this is my favorite from them. That should give you an idea of how much I love this film.<br/><br/>I know a few people that don't like this movie simply because of the northern accents used in the movie.

","""Fargo"", a film by the Coen Brothers, is one great film, one that stands the test of time (being timeless even after 10 years). The strengths of this film lies with the screenplay, story, and the actors. Combined together, you get a classic dark comedy. Of special note are actors Frances McDormand as the pregnant Officer Marge Gunderson who spearheads the murder case that this film revolves around. She lives a very stable life with a happy and complacent marriage to her husband, about to have their first child. It's as if this role was created for McDormand, for she is a pleasure to watch. Also kudos to William H. Macy and Steve Buscemi who are great in their roles too. Without giving more away, all I will say is go see this film.

Macy also had the excellent dialogue with Wade and Stan Grossman, so there's that. And the opening scene when you see him talking to Buscemi about the kidnapping is incredible, so there's that too. SO Macy made the movie. But what elevated it to a whole other level was the inclusion of the scene with Margie and Mike. I mean, what did that have to do with anything? And yet it was genius. Think of some Mike's lines: ""Well, it's a Radisson, so it's pretty good."" ""She had..leukemia."" ""She fought real hard, Margie.""

","One of the greatest films of the 90's was this beautifully quirky and darkly suspenseful thriller from Joel and Ethan Coen.<br/><br/>Minnistota man hires some thugs to fake a kidnapping with his wife, but the foolish team quickly fouls things up and a small-town policewoman is about to uncover the crime.<br/><br/>Recalling a lot of the elements of the Coen's debut thriller Blood Simple (1984), Fargo also proves to be a unique and smartly told drama/thriller. The story is more complex this time, with an even larger band of colorful (and often dim-witted) characters. Fargo is one of those rare films that has a little bit of every film genre in its story. You have film noir, slick comedy, suspense-thriller, parody, and even small-town drama all weaved into one terrifically amusing gem of a film. The direction is wonderfully well-done, as is the beautifully atmospheric music score.<br/><br/>The cast of this film is excellent. Frances McDormand is perfectly lovable as the films rather unlikely heroine, a pregnant small-town cop. William H. Macy is subtly funny as the films desperate conspirator. Steve Buscemi is a stand out as one of the idiot kidnappers. The rest of the cast is also solidly good!<br/><br/>A masterpiece of a movie, probably the Coen's best, that's a true must-see for all film fans!<br/><br/>**** out of ****"

","Fargo is one of the greatest films of the last 20 years. The story is very basic. A kidnapping case with a very dedicated detective. However, the intricacies of the story for example: A pregnant Woman detective, the husband masterminded the whole kidnapping and the unique setting of the mid-west make this film unique. Ethan Cohen did an incredible job of making the movie so brutal and cold. You can feel the dark tension while watching the kidnappers in the car as well as the cabin. All the performances were great but Frances McDormand and William H. Macy were the best. Frances McDormand performance was remarkable as the detective and deserved the academy award. She was the constant moral individual in a setting of immoral people. Macy's performance was equally impressive. One aspect of this movie that sets the haunting tone is the score which was was perfect for the movie. If you like drama's you will thoroughly enjoy this film."

Also the bright cold weather gave an exotic touch to the usually hot Hollywood-scene.<br/><br/>Another Fargo-like movie is ""The Big White"" starring by Robin Williams and Holly Hunter but the movie isn't as good as ""Fargo"". Though worth watching if you liked the freezing scenery of ""Fargo""."

","Fargo remains, to this day, the epitome of the crime-caper gone wrong. The film works on so many levels, it's one of the few films that were nominated for Best Picture that broke the typical mold and was nominated for it's creativity. Everything about this movie seems to click together perfectly, the writing, the acting, and the execution... no pun intended. <br/><br/>William H. Macy and Frances McDormand, in her Oscar-Winning role, perfectly characterize, if not stereotype a little, the thick-accented North-Westerner. William H. Macy excellently portrays Jerry Lundegaard in such a way that we admire his determination and care enough for him and his crazy plight, but not too much, so when we see Jerry get his final retribution, we aren't too upset, and know enough to know that he got what he deserved. Frances McDormand comes off as very likable and admirable as the pregnant police officer Marge Gunderson. She is portrayed as a smart cop, and very stern when it comes to her job. But she is also gentle and safe, perfectly exhibited in the final scene of the film. Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare have in this film what I call 'Anti-Chemistry' as the comically notorious Carl and Gaer. Anti-Chemistry is when we have two characters so different, that they create very interesting chemistry on screen, proving that opposites attract. Steve Buscemi, in his Oscar-worthy role, is hilariously annoying as Carl, butting heads with Peter Stormare's chilling yet blunt portrayal as the sociopathic Gaer. Next is the writing and directing. Definitely deserved the Oscar it won for Best Original Screenplay, it unfolds as Film Noir, but the Coen brothers, knowing better, set the film in the most un-Noir setting imaginable: Minnesota. This interesting twist allows the Coens to insert dark humor, which plays off perfectly from the simple and dim-witted sounding people from which the film takes place. I'd like to briefly note the Score, which wasn't nominated for any special awards, but I think it's one of the best film-scores I've heard. The employment of fiddles and violins give us a very small and closed feeling, but it becomes quite grand and epic, matching the seemingly small aesthetic of both the music and the film, giving it much more meaning to what's happening. <br/><br/>Overrall, excellent crime caper/black comedy, with great acting, writing, and cinematography to boot."

","Jerry has it all. A great family that he does not appreciate or value in the least. He is willing to sacrifice all of that for money.<br/><br/>His primary motivation for marrying his wife is her father's money. And when that is not enough for him he risks her life to get more.<br/><br/>Frances McDormand's character is like good looking into evil and self-centeredness. Just her pregnancy alone is symbolic of life in the face of death and evil. Also, the loving relationship she so values with her caring husband is a stark contrast to Jerry's values and motivations. She is police officer, concerned with justice and good. He is, of all things, a car salesman. His motivation in life is to make a sale, even if it means lying and betraying the trust of his customers.<br/><br/>The scene with the Chinese friend of Marge furthers the family values theme. Here is a guy with no family. He is so desperate for it, he is willing to lie about his so called ""wife"" having cancer to gain sympathy from Marge. He stalks women and goes about finding love all wrong. He doesn't get it. Love cannot be won by manipulation and force.<br/><br/>The men who Jerry hires to kidnap his wife are sociopaths. And the film makes the statement that even a guy like Jerry, who may have never resorted to this kind of behavior, can fall prey to his own selfish wants. He has dipped into this underworld and then realizes later he made a big mistake.<br/><br/>I gave it 9 stars out of 10 due to one very annoying aspect. The product placement in the film is over the top. I thought it cheapened an otherwise great film. The ""It's a Radisson, so it's pretty good,"" comment was what really got me.

","---Spoilers--- <br/><br/>The Coen Brothers are famous for many comedies and other types of movies such as ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"", ""Blood Simple,"" and ""The Big Lebowski."" Their most famous one is ""Fargo."" <br/><br/>""Fargo"" is their thriller and dark comedy that takes place in a small town. The story line is about a man named Jerry who lives in a small town and tries to get his wife's money by hiring two criminals.<br/><br/>I didn't understand ""Fargo."" There were many moments or confusion or vagueness, like all the attacks on one of the criminals. Perhaps this was a technique to build up suspense. Or, it could have just assumed that the audience would be able to understand it. Either way, it seemed unclear to me.<br/><br/>Yet, even if it's a confusing thriller/black comedy, it succeeds in both.<br/><br/>I heard that a good thriller needs twists. Well, ""Fargo"" is full of them. It's full of violence, and uses the violence to further the thrills. It also uses the shocking twists to make the audience jump. For example, when Jerry gets the phone call from Carl, it sends a chill through the audience's spine. There are also the psychological moments, where the audience is kept at the edge of their seat by asking ""What's going to happen next?"" Take the part with the car lot. The audience knows that Jerry is lying, and we also know that Marge doesn't. So what's going to happen next? Is she going to find out? Is she going to get shot? Is she going to leave? <br/><br/>It also works as a comedy. I think it's because of the funny accents (Darn Tootin') but it sure works! I found ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" funny, and ""Fargo"" seems too also work as a comedy. Just remember that one scene: <br/><br/>""What does he look like?"" <br/><br/>""Oh, kind of funny looking."" <br/><br/>""How so?"" <br/><br/>""Oh, in a general kind of way."" <br/><br/>It's funny...isn't it?<br/><br/>Overall, I hardly understood ""Fargo,"" but if you want a thriller that has millions of twists, this one is for youif you could understand it.<br/><br/>Good: Entertaining, thrilling, funny and millions of plot twists <br/><br/>Bad: It was kind of hard to understand."

The movie wasn't BAD, but it really wasn't that GOOD either. There are some unexplained parts of the movie, such as how William Macy's character, Jerry Lundegaard, became SO financially desperate; what EXACTLY happened to his wife, Jean, played by Kristin Rudrüd; or how Carl, played by Steve Buscemi, and his insane mate Gaear know each other. I think a more realistic film would show how the criminals are still human and would explain in better detail why they continue to ""deal"" with their problems in such an erratic way.

"triple8","7","0","0","8 January 2006"," a good movie but overrated. Loses power as it goes along.
","SPOILERS: <br/><br/>I am not one who hated Fargo. I can see, watching this, just why it is considered as such a great film. But I also think it's overrated. I was disappointed when it was over and don't think it is nearly as good as many have said. Here's why.<br/><br/>First the positives. In the beginning and part of the middle nearly everything is positive. And I do mean everything. The performances were great. The landscapes were breathtaking. The musical score was phenomenal, among the best. The movie was compellingly atmospheric. The story was interesting and the dialog was superb. The movie is clearly superior to many other films. It sucks you in from the beginning and there is so much power to the movie, from the opening, that one is on the edge of their seat waiting as the movie gathers momentum.<br/><br/>And that is why I did not love this. It gathers momentum all right. But it goes nowhere. The whole time I was watching this I was waiting for an incredible ending, for something along the lines of The Usual Suspects. But it never happened. It's not that the film is bad, it's just that it is so powerful from the beginning, but it never develops into anything at the end. The movie ended so suddenly I was still waiting for another half hour at least. At the end, I said to myself: is that all? The movie promises something big but it doesn't deliver. I thought maybe something would happen with the buried money, with maybe some kind of ""twist"", SOMETHING. There were all these ""little things"" seen throughout the movie which I filed away to myself, thinking they would somehow be very important to the storyline later but their not. Instead the movie became a mish mash of fights, gory murders, and.....that's it. Toward the end, there was to much an emphasis on violence and not enough on anything else. (Though the movie's violent throughout, in the beginning and middle there was also an emphasis on the story.) The speech that Mc.Drmand made at the end was powerful but the end as a whole was nowhere near the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>I'd compare it to watching a really good movie and then finding out at the end it was all a dream. I personally do not like those type of films either. But this was similar because we, the viewer are lead to think a lot more is going to happen that what finally does. Even the scene with Jerry getting arrested, although I'm glad he gets caught, could have been even more powerful. The film just ends, leaving the viewer to think:that's IT? I Personally thought Fargo was a 10 of 10 at TIMES. But I felt it really needed something more to give a feeling of completeness which it did not have. I know many, if not most, think it's a 10 of 10 but I'm just not in the majority here though I agree the movie had certain great aspects for me it definitely was not outstanding.<br/><br/>In closing I'd say, the dialog, the acting, the musical score etc were terrific but the movie's shortcomings really became apparent toward the end. The movie left a bad taste in my mouth and though I can absolutely see why many love this so much I was disappointed. My vote's 7 of 10."

","I finally got a chance to see, well, most of this movie. I missed the first few minutes, but now understand what all the acclaim has been about.<br/><br/>It's easy to look at Frances McDormand's performance and draw the superficial conclusion that this is going to be some silly comedy, especially if you saw her in Raising Arizona. But there's a much deeper story here, some very profound collaboration in terms of the ""meaning"" of the story and the way it is brought to the screen.<br/><br/>There are plenty of comedic elements, including the ""dumb and dumber"" kidnappers and William H. Macy as the desperate loser. Some of the dialect may or may not be laid on a tad too thick -- endless streams of ""yah...yah...yah..."". Still, the essence of the movie is felt in the scenes where McDormand is patiently driving her police ""prowler"" through the never-ending snow. Especially at the end, when she remarks, ""...and it's a beautiful day."" For the moviegoer who is unfamiliar with the colder, quieter parts of the country and the people who inhabit it, it can take awhile to sink in. This story is about the decent folks all around us, the ones we never see on Entertainment Tonight, who live quiet, unassuming lives and still manage to elevate themselves to lofty heights by virtue of their simple understanding of what is right and what is wrong. McDormand's Marge Gunderson is 7 months pregnant, and yet she slogs uncomplainingly through the snow to examine crime scenes. She risks her neck daily; yet, she cheers on her painter husband when his portrait is accepted by the Post Office to be depicted on a 2-cent stamp. She is listening to an old boyfriend's sob story one afternoon, and shooting a wood-chipper murderer in the leg the next.<br/><br/>This really is an awesome film.

The father of the wife is real well off and it is Jerry's idea to exploit that. Jerry's plan is to have his wife's father pay the ransom of a million dollars for his wife, but Jerry would keep all the money except for 40 thousand which is going to the kidnappers. The plan goes wrong early in the movie and situations get more complex than they already are.""Fargo"" is my favorite Cohen brothers movie. The greatness of ""Fargo"" surpasses even ""The Big Lebowski"" in my book. I recommend everyone watch this movie even if you are not a Cohen Brothers fan. The great thing about the brothers movies is that even if you don't share their same sense of humor and don't laugh once, the movies they make still hold up with their great stories. But if you do share the same sense of humor, the comedy is just another layer of greatness. Fargo has everything; suspense, a good story, humor, brilliant acting and a score that accompanies the visuals perfectly.Steve Buscemi, and William H. Macy put out top-notch performances as usual.

","This is my absolute favorite movie of all times. It's the kind of film you can see over and over. It's the kind of film that can make you cry in unexpected places, like at the end, around the 3rd or 4th time you've seen it. Part of the greatness of this story is that it grows out of the location and characters where the authors grew up, around Fargo, South Dakota. The characters are another important part, because not only are they interesting people, but they represent a cross-section of common attitudes about justice. Jerry sees justice in terms of financial and personal advantages. Gaear understands justice as always doing what is necessary to survive, given his criminal life style. Carl defines justice as being in the right (probably like most of us). Finally, justice to Marge means no harm done so that tomorrow will be better.<br/><br/>The snow is a metaphor for purity or perfection, against which backdrop, the conflicts of the world must take place."

","Possibly the darkest of all comedies, Fargo puts aches in my stomach but taste in the cinemas. Frances McDormand plays the very pregnant homicide detective which remains the most important well played character in the movie even though we see her in the very deep center of the movie. The simple accents, quirky characters, and tiny jokes hid the film away from its darkness. If not for those things the movie would far from a comedy. The wood chipper sequence, the cruel laugh Carl screamed when Gene fell in the snow, and of course the idea of kidnapping your own wife. The movie also was funny because it didn't try to be. For instance when Carl was being beaten up by Shep or when he was shot in the face or when blew a fuse on the parking man. The movie was made in a way that seemed funny yet mixed it in with death. This film is great, made well, written well, and extremely funny."

They brought tons of intensity to the film, especially Buscemi, who I think is a fantastic actor and McDormand's performance was pretty funny with her Minnesota accent.

","Director: Joel Coen, Script: Ethan and Joel Coen, Cast: Frances Mcdormand, William H. Macy, Steve Buscemi, Peter Stormare, Kristin Rudrud, Harve Presnell.<br/><br/>This might just be the Coen brothers at their best. This film is funny, suspenseful and at times shocking. I just recently saw Raising Arizona again and although it is also a great film I think I prefer the dark comedy and 'film noir' elements of Fargo. Set in the heartland of Minnosota, this film is about a sales manager (Jerry played by William H. Macy) who is in deep financial trouble. He tries to con his rich father in-law out of a large sum of money by staging a kidnapping of his wife for ransom. He hires a couple of thugs (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) to do the job but things don't go quite as planned. People end up dead and now Jerry is in all kinds of trouble. The local police chief Marge (a very pregnant police chief played by Frances McDormand) gets involved in the case.<br/><br/>I thought the Minnosota location in winter time was a perfect setting for this kind of film. It represents middle America turned upside down! Frances McDormand was great as the small town police chief. She was very funny and did a great job impersonating the Minnosota accent and words--yaw! Steve Buscemi is good as usual. Even as a tough bad guy his nerdy self still comes across! It is funny how he can be a absolute nerd like he was in Ghost World and a total bad ass in this film yet pretty much act the exact same way! This move is very violent and unsettling at times but it is offset somewhat by Marge and Norm (her husband). They offer some normalcy in this film. We take comfort in them.<br/><br/>This film has the offbeat characters that the Coen brothers are known for. The excellent setting and cinematography, black humour and suspense make this film a must see. One of the best films of the 90's. A modern classic."

","The problem with Fargo is that there aren't any substantial characters. Everyone, from the overwrought Jerry to the methodical Marge, is a pure caricature. None of these people are particularly interesting or sympathetic, and watching their exploits becomes a detached experience. By the end of the film, you're more interested in how the filmmakers choose to tie together loose ends than whether any particular individual lives or dies. In the past, the Coens have managed to create characters worth caring about; such is not the case here, and it greatly diminishes Fargo's effectiveness.<br/><br/>Born and raised in Minnesota, the Coens know their home state, which accounts for their ability to reflect reality there (which is like unreality for most of the rest of the country). People say things like ""You're darn tootin'"", ""aw, geez,"" and ""what the heck"". Knowing how strange the talk of Minnesotans will seem to the rest of the world, the Coens intentionally play it for deadpan comic effect."

It is the cinematic equivalent of Salvador Dali's artwork: unpredictable, magical and completely out-worldly in a very worldly way, if it makes any sense. I don't think there's a movie that even remotely resembles this one in any way.

I watched it again tonight after a two-year hiatus and am as struck by it as I was when I rented it in 1999.<br/><br/>The repeated comments I read from non-fans of this film are: ""It's BORING! It's TOO SLOW! It's NOT FUNNY!"" Well, it's true, there are none of the following: Bruckheimer-style car chases, explosions, gratuitous balloon-like jugs, pratfalls, or jokes about bodily secretions. And this was never, ever meant to be a comedy. It was billed by some as a ""black comedy,"" yes, and even that incorrectly for my money, but by definition that is not the same thing. <br/><br/>What it is, is a study of the good and the bad that can exist right under our noses in the most benign of places. That's it. It has the bonus of lovingly drawn characters that you can't help feeling you've met...and an understanding of what that part of the country is like. If you've never lived there or don't have any family from there, you're probably not going to get a true sense of HOW true to life it is.<br/><br/>Speaking of characters, I think that Marge Gunderson still ranks up there to me as one of the iconic film images of bravery and kindness...whether she's encouraging her husband's banal hobby or confronting a bad guy, she's a waddling, unswayed symbol of integrity. And it takes considerable skill (by both the Coen Brothers and Ms. McDormand) to make us buy it. Her husband is a warm spot too...he starts out as a laconic Midwestern guy, short on sparkle or sex appeal  until he turns out to be a beacon of love and goodness in a brutal world. One of the great film marriages, ever."

""Fargo"" is a movie directed by the Coen Brothers, for which we know what their themes are in every movie: eccentricity.<br/><br/>The film starts off with Jerry Lundergard (William H. Macy), a cheapskate car dealer who cannot give out a correct answer to everything he is doing, now he wants to fake a kidnapping of his wife in order to receive money from his father in law; so he hires two bumbling thieves (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wife, while one of them tells him to ask money from the wife.<br/><br/>So now the thieves are on their way to Fargo, North Dakota where after Jerry and his kid are gone, the thieves break into Jerry's home and kidnap his wife and going on a spree killing people left and right.

He'll then split the money with them and pay off his debts. Unfortunately things do not go to plan, seven people end up unnecessarily dead and Marge Gunderson, the unstoppable Brainerd County Chief of Police is on the case.<br/><br/>This is a dramatic enigma of a picture in the classic Coen Brothers style - on the surface it's a straight crime drama about a pathetic loser whose get-rich-quick scheme backfires in a colossal way. On the other hand, the characters are so off the wall that at times the movie is more of a satirical comedy. The wintry Minnesota / North Dakota locations are crucial to the atmosphere, as are the Scandinavian ""yaah"" accents, in a film all about coldness of character. The cast are fantastic, with Macy and McDormand diametric opposites of selfishness and sincerity and Buscemi and Stormare as goofy yet terrifying killers, who redefine the word stupid. Featuring extraordinary beautiful photography by Roger Deakins and a terrific spare score by Carter Burwell. Whilst this is not as flashy or visually inventive as some of their other films (Miller's Crossing, The Hudsucker Proxy), this is perhaps the Coens most personal and acutely-observed movie (they grew up in Minnesota). It's not really an enjoyable experience, but it's a memorable one, and if nothing else, Marge's warmth, intelligence and polite good nature is a ray of beauty in a cold and desolate landscape."

","There's something almost mystical about the pacing and plot turns of Fargo. It really is something of a unique film; it's hard to compare other films to it. Those unfamiliar with life around North Dakota land will be especially intrigued, because it is a slice of America that Hollywood routinely ignores. The lifestyle is not only captured on film by direct means, it is captured indirectly simply through the pacing and erm... Color? Angles? Way?.. the film is shot. It puts you there.<br/><br/>But you won't be focusing on that, you will be focusing on the riveting plot and performances of every actor in the film. You will experience the feeling of North Dakota along the way, but it is not the chief commodity of the film. If there were an Academy Award for the person/people who do casting for a film, this is one that should have won that year. From largest role to smallest, everyone is amazingly perfect.<br/><br/>My only complaint with the film was how it was originally billed. It was billed as based on a true story. That must have been some sleazy move by the studio to help promote a film they felt would otherwise go unnoticed, because the film is not based on any real life story at all.

","I'll never think of Minnesota the same again after seeing 'Fargo'. 'Fargo' is based on the fascinating true story about a loser car salesman (William H. Macy) and his ill-fated attempt to strike rich by paying two thugs (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wife, so his father-in-law (Harve Pushnell) who's one of the richest men in the small town of Brainerd, Minnesota would pay off an $80,000 ransom. The car salesman would then split the money 50/50 with the kidnappers after getting his wife back. This all went terribly wrong, and a pregnant police officer (Frances McDormand - in her Academy Award winning role) started to put together the pieces of the puzzle. 'Fargo' is the film that tells this story, and the Coen Brothers (Blood Simple, Miller's Crossing, Raising Arizona) do an incredible job telling it. <br/><br/>'Fargo' is the perfect blend of suspense, drama and dark comedy, and will have you on the edge of your seat in suspense one moment, and the other moment in hysteria. The acting is terrific, especially Frances McDormand who received her well deserved Oscar as the kind, funny and perceptive police detective solving the three homicides that are committed by the two kidnapping thugs during the course of the kidnapping. William H. Macy is perfectly cast in his very best screen performance to date as the nervous and oafish weasel car salesman, that should have won him the Oscar back in 1996. Steve Buscemi is amazing as the violent, twisted and scrawny kidnapper with a scary temper. His performance should have gotten him an Oscar nomination, no buts about it. Buscemi also provides us with one of his best performances in 'Fargo'. Peter Stormare does a decent job as the stone-cold villain partner of Buscemi, and The Drew Carey Show's John Carroll Lynch is sincere and funny during the very limited screen time he has. Harve Pushnell also provides great work as always, as the rich and selfish father-in-law to Macy's character. The directing and writing are most likely the two best qualities of the film and should have gotten The Coen Brothers double Oscars (instead of just one for Best Screenplay). Roger Deakins gives us amazing cinematography as always, and 'Fargo' has a powerful musical score. <br/><br/>If you haven't seen 'Fargo' already, you should definitely rent it, and if you have seen it and don't own it, buy it on DVD now! The special edition DVD includes a documentary about the true incident entitled 'Minnesota Nice', interviews with the Coen Brothers and Frances McDormand, audio commentary by the film's cinematographer Roger Deakins, a trivia track, a behind-the-scenes photo gallery, movie trailers of the film, and more. 'Fargo' is an excellent motion picture, but not for everybody. If you're offended by graphic violence and don't find any humor in it, chances are you will not take a liking to 'Fargo'. So, if you are a member of any anti-movie violence organization or anything like that steer clear of 'Fargo'. Grade: A-<br/><br/>MADE MY TOP 300 LIST AT #48"

","The Coen Brothers do not write a movie based on a situation but on the setting and its cast of characters. Although we are not in Arizona anymore, the story shift to another world....far up north. We are still speaking English, but it is far from how they talk in the rest of the country. The characters create the situation and create the entertainment. When looking at a story and asking yourself, what comes first, the plot or the characters? When it comes to the Coen Brothers, the characters create their plot. Considered by many to be their best work, Fargo is unique and far beyond good. It is a movie made before its time for an audience who doesn't totally understand it.

"OllieZ","9","0","0","6 April 2005"," Coen magic.
","There are two Coen brothers movies that stand the test of time after repeated viewings. There is the neo-noir Miller's Crossing (1990) and Fargo. Far from what went on to win the Oscar for best picture (English Patient), this film is a smaller, more personal tale of tragedy and violence in a place you'd least expect it.<br/><br/>The Coens are sometimes criticised for their work being too cold, sometimes distant and too intelligent for the audience. Well, they never seemed to be that in-depth to me, instead they also seemed to create really enjoyable movies. Fargo is a really fun movie to watch, although I can understand it might be a little difficult for some to watch - the contrast of comedy and violence is quite extreme in scenes, but I didn't have a problem with this.<br/><br/>Fargo is cold and distant in one sense, being that is is set in the beautifully frozen Minosotta. The story is the usual Coen ""noir"" set up - and always the Coens give an edge to the story. The Coens are ""...like a goddamn twist!"" as Leo said in Miller's Crossing. William H. Macey giving another great performance plays the husband who hires two inept crooks, Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare to kidnap his wife, so he can get the ransom money from the father of his wife, Harve Presnell (who is so stubborn is good).<br/><br/>This story reminded me of the Coen's love for double crossings, mishaps in the plan and tragedy - themes we have seen in Miller's Crossing (deception, double, triple crossings) and Blood Simple with murder, adultery etc. Fargo has refined this technique, as the themes are woven into the tight narrative and amusing atmosphere.<br/><br/>Being a relatively short the film, the story really does truck along well, never really becoming boring - unless you are not in tune to the Coen brothers wit and style. For every violent scene (and believe me, there are some!) there is a funny one, like the infamous ""He was kinda funny lookin'..."" dialogue.<br/><br/>The performances are fantastic, Macy being brilliant, and McDormand on top form as the pregnant cop Marge Gunderson. Seeing as we don't see her until half an hour in, her presence is powerful, just subtly burning up the screen. Buscemi and Stormare are a great duo as the two hapless crooks who are carrying out the plan for Macy. Stormare is just chilling, with his cold as ice stare, and Buscemi neurotic and hilarious. Even the bit part actors give great performances, just adding to the reality of Fargo. The accents were thought to be the main source of the comedy, but they are genuine accents! I loved it.<br/><br/>The music by Carter Burwell is haunting and cold, just like the land it accompanies. Cinematography by Roger Deakins is some of the most inventive and fresh stuff I have seen in years. The fact it is more original than the ""David Lean"" homage, The English Patient, is another pointer to argue why this film didn't win Best Picture. A disgrace.<br/><br/>Possibly one of the best films of the 90's.<br/><br/>Is it the best Coen brother's movie? ""You're darned tootin'!"""
"Eumenides_0","10","0","0","2 April 2005"," Another Brilliant Coen Movie!
","I love the Coens for many things; it is especially for the unique vision and quality they put into their brilliant movies, but it is also for their uncompromising study of the darkest side of Mankind. Ever since they debuted with the superb 'Blood Simple,' the Coens have explored the worst in man's soul and psyche, the horrible things that makes him tick in disturbing ways, the things that leads one to violent, pointless things like kidnapping and murder. 'Fargo' is their darkest movie second only to their disturbing debut. A saving grace this movie has which the other didn't have is basically the dark humour in the right moments to lighten the tension in the air.<br/><br/>Like 'Blood Simple,' the story is straightforwardly simple and linear: Jerry Lundegaard, in the middle of personal problems the viewer never figures out exactly what they are, hires Carl and Gaer, two inhuman criminals, to kidnap his wife Jean so his father-in-law will pay a ransom, a part of which will go straight into Jerry's pockets. It sounds too simple to be interesting, but 'Fargo' is really one of most gripping thrillers I've ever seen! The first half hour unfolds smoothly as one would expect  Jerry's plan working just perfectly to avoid innocent deaths  until an unexpected incident turns everything upside-down. Like Carl tells Jerry, ""the circumstances have changed."" And this is when Marge, the most unlikely sheriff to investigate a triple murder ever, comes into the picture and the movie reaches the heights of greatness and perfection.<br/><br/>This movie is built on two very simple, well-achieved things. Sure, one can go on about the outstanding cinematography that captures the snow-white landscapes of Minnesota so beautifully, the smooth editing, and the Coens' use of the camera. But 'Fargo' owes its quality to an intelligent screenplay and a wide range of outstanding performances. The dialogue  clear, subtle and economical  transmits volumes of information in just a few lines; not a line is wasted or fails to humanise one of the characters. The story is so fast-paced within the first ten lines we already know what everything is about. Most movies don't really start until the end of the first half hour to comply with the three-act structure device of the plot point. Relationships are established quickly: one immediately gets the sense Wade thinks Jerry is a bumbling fool who can't handle too much responsibility; one sees Jerry doesn't like Wade just from the way he feels uncomfortable in his present. Carl and Gaer's relationship is built on the fact these two men know nothing about each other and have nothing to talk about, as Carl points out to Gaer; the former is the biggest chatterer around, the latter is silent: in essence, these are two complete strangers who just got together to pull of a kidnapping and get money. The quality of this screenplay is also evident in the way the Coens transmit so much information visually: so many things are left unsaid because strong images fill in the holes for the viewer. In the end, this screenplay is the one of the best and most economical screenplays ever written for modern cinema! <br/><br/>The performances are consistently great, too! William H. Macy captures the pathetic existence that forms Jerry so well! His lack of determination, his little mannerisms, his idiolect, his hesitation, cravenness, his sense of insecurity; Jerry might just be the greatest human failure in American cinema and Macy played him brilliantly! Frances McDormand is also perfect as the unusual heroine  a pregnant small town sheriff looking for two criminals responsible for a triple murder. McDormand plays Marge wonderfully with all the local innocence inherent in the character, her good manners and strength, so opposed to Jerry's weakness which becomes his doom. Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare are well-cast as two cruel, greedy, ruthless criminals who recklessly kill and hurt people just for the ridiculous sum of $80,000. Human greed was never so well portrayed as in 'Fargo.' Stormare is great even though he remains silent throughout most of the movie; but Buscemi is just electrifying! He shines in every scene he's in, whether it be when he's collecting the money from Wade, when he's getting his ass kicked hard or just when he shows glimpses of his cruelty like when he snickers at Jerry's helpless, hand-bound, blind-folded wife trying to make her way across a frozen landscape. One last great performance was Harve Presnell's as Wade, the determined father-in-law who spells doom for Jerry.<br/><br/>'Fargo' is consistently perfect throughout its 90 minutes: it's a small, but very intense and fast-paced movie. It's not as gripping as the Coens' debut, the movie which to me strikes more similarities with this one than any other Coen movie. But this one isn't as violent, there's also a fantastic dark, acid humour in every scene. The scene where the hulking Shep Proudfoot beats the crap out of a naked Carl is priceless! <br/><br/>Like 'Blood Simple,' I originally didn't enjoy 'Fargo:' it took me a few viewings to finally love this movie; today it's one of my favourites! I'm constantly watching it on DVD, marvelling at the small details that make this movie so consistently good. It's another great movie for the Coens in what is an otherwise perfect career!"

All this in order to secure a $80,000.00 ransom from her dad Wade Gustafson, Harve Presnell, who's one of the richest men in Brainerd.Jerry and the two hoods were brought together by a mutual friend ex-con Shep Proudfoot, Steve Reevis, who not only spent time with both Carl & Gaear in the Stillwaters State Pen but also works as a car mechanic at the dealership that Jerry is working at and who his father-in-law Wade owns.<br/><br/>Like the off-the-wall misfits that they are the plan goes to pot as soon as it's executed with a bungled kidnapping of Jean and later that evening the murder of a state trooper, James Saulke, and two windlessness who happened to come on the scene, J. Todd Anderson & Michelle Suzanne LeDoux, by the somewhat unstable Gear. Jerry needs the $40,000.00, his half in the deal, to replace money that he embezzled from the car dealership that he's working at. As the movie ""Fargo"" go along it's marry way it, the money that Jerry embezzled, rises to almost $400,000.00. <br/><br/>After the murdered bodies of the three victims of Gaear's rampage are discovered the police chief of Brainerd Marge Gunderson, Frances McDormand,is called into the case. Marge slowly gets all the evidence together and puts it in place thus cracking the murder/kidnap mystery wide open. Marge is a lot like TV's Let. Colombo, at first you don't for a moment realize that she's a policewomen much less the Chief of police in Brainerd County.Later her street, or lets say country, smarts and bulldog determination makes you as well as everyone else watching the movie believers long before the film ""Fargo"" is over.<br/><br/>Homely looking with an enormous appetite, due to her being pregnant, Marge slowly gets to the bottom of the murder mystery by zeroing in on Jerry who she felt was keeping some very important information for her. He doesn't realize that a car, a tan Ciera that was spotted at the murder scene,is missing from his car lot and that one of his workers Shep was in cohorts by phone with the two ex-cons! Shep received a phone call from the bar-motel where the two were staying at.<br/><br/>Jerry tries to be cute even with his fellow partners in crime by upping the ransom to one million dollars without them knowing about it and insisting that he deliver the goods,the one million dollar ransom, by himself; so he can keep most of the money to cover his string embezzlement's at the car dealership. The entire scheme backfires when Wade insists that he handle the ransom pay-off, after all it's his money, that leads to him to getting shot and killed by an outraged Carl who was in turn is shot in the jaw by Wade before he died. <br/><br/>At the hideout with Gaear and the kidnapped Jean, Carl also tried to cheat Gaear out of the Million by giving him only $40,000.00 of the ransom, It's hen when Carl finds thats Gaear murdered Jean and ends up getting split in half and murdered himself with an ax by his insane partner. <br/><br/>Meanwhile Marge closes in on the gang and has Jerry on the run and out of the state, he's later arrested by the cops at a motel in Bismarck ND. Gaear is also captured by Marge as he tried to hide the evidence of his crimes, the bodies of Jean & Carl, by chopping them to pieces with a wood-chopping machine. <br/><br/>Even though the movie ""Fargo"" has it's share of thrills and excitement it also has it's touching moments too. One of the most moving scenes in the movie has to do with Marge meeting an old high school friend of hers at a local Minneapolis hotel restaurant Mike Yanagita, Steve Park. Mike goes into a whole song and dance about him working for the Honeywell Corp.as an engineer and how he lost his wife Linda, who Marge also knew from high school, to leukemia. Unable to talk anymore Mike begins to break down right in front of the startled policewomen sobbing uncontrollably. Later Marge found out that Mike was never married and doesn't work for the Honeywell Corp. and has been living with his parents since he left high school. <br/><br/>If Mike was honest about his feelings to Marge, as well as any of his other friends, he would have easily gotten the sympathy that he wanted instead of being a phony to both Marge as well as to himself."

","Rather than expound on the excellent review of Robert Maxwell (above) I'll just say I like the way he points out the finer qualities of a Joel and Ethan Coen movie. To a ""t"" as a matter of fact.<br/><br/>I always like to think of Coen brothers movies this way though, and the brothers are consistent in this, they always have two extra characters in their film. One is the scenery or the look of the film. The other is the dialog; specifically accents or dialects.<br/><br/>This was true of their first, Blood Simple, with stark flat Texas scenery and the dialog heavily laced with Texas twang/drawl and their last (as of this writing) Intolerable Cruelty equally laced with the beautiful scenery of Southern California and the rapid fire language of attorneys. I especially enjoyed ""Puffy"" von Espy's testimony.<br/><br/>============= possible spoiler =============<br/><br/>I suppose what I admire most about this particular film is that they not only pull off the desolation of the upper Midwest in deep winter they also manage to capture the simple (yes even seemingly stupid) yet forthright people that inhabit that region of the country. And yes though the two criminals are the most colorful and interesting of the characters one has to admire the police chief (played by Frances McDormand) who is not only female but eight months pregnant. She commands a great deal of consideration and respect from her men who remain pleasant, caring, and totally dedicated to her and the performance of their jobs. Even her husband, whose claim to fame is being selected for his mallard painting which is to be printed on the three cent stamp, seems to understand just how truly exceptional his wife is, and in turn, becomes truly exceptional himself.<br/><br/>Is Marge dainty and fragile in her condition? Not at all, yet she is one hundred percent female just the same.<br/><br/>William H. Macy performs beautifully as the John Q. Milquetoast husband who just can't seem to do anything right.<br/><br/>Harve Presnell is convincing as Jean Lundegaard's business-man father.<br/><br/>Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare are credible as two bumbling, rather stupid, and completely deadly criminals.<br/><br/>Only Kristin Rudrüd seems to have an almost non-part (no speaking, but plenty of screaming), but hey, this is her first film. The screams, reactions, and fear were well done.<br/><br/>It's a strange little movie, but interesting and well worth watching for that reason; just like all Coen brother's movies."

","Fargo is one of those films that, if it is on, I have to sit down and watch. No matter how many times I have seen it, this film still enthralls me. A very bleak yet funny account of a botched kidnapping, in which a used car salesman, Jerry Lundegaard (William H Macy) hires two criminals to kidnap his wife, in order to fleece his rich father in law. However as the plan becomes reality, all that can go wrong does, and a series of tragic events unfold, which spells doom for Lundegaard and sets off a slew of collateral damage, which tears apart a tiny north mid-western town. <br/><br/>The small everyday nuances that the Coen brothers seem to relish exploiting in this film, and the innocence of these good hearted small town folk is what gives this film it much needed sense of reality. A sense of reality which a film like this needs in order to stand out and to have any impact whatsoever, and this film has tons of impact. Frances McDormand is excellent as Marge Gunderson, the quirky yet intelligent Brainerd police officer that is investigating several murders near the town of Brainerd. Unbeknownst to Marge her investigation will lead her into Lundegaard's web of kidnapping, murder, and betrayal. And what she discovers will test her emotional and moral strength. Near the end of the film, you can see the emotion and the pain in her face as she tries to comprehend what she has just witnessed and as she realizes what incredible evil men are capable of. What is worse is that it was all for a little money. As Marge says in the film ""There's more to life than a little money, ya know. Don'tcha know that?""<br/><br/>Most of the laughs come from the way the people talk and interact with one another, which if you are not from the mid-west or northern great lakes area can be pretty amusing at first. But after the shock of the accents wear off, Steve Buscemi's ""funny looking, little guy"" character as the bumbling foul mouth thug is funny until it becomes just mean spirited and then tragic. Peter Stormare plays a stoic and frighteningly calm murderer and sidekick to Steve Buscemi's character.<br/><br/>The film is great and overall very entertaining, but one of the things That I love watching every time I see this film, is watching William H Macy's character place the noose around his neck and watch it slowly tighten, until he has no more room to maneuver and is suffocated (figuratively speaking) by the lies he tells and then the lies he tells in order to cover up his original lies. Overall a fascinating film with an intelligent script and great performances."

","When this film came out in 1997, a Norwegian movie-critic wrote that ""This is the film that makes Quentin Tarantino look like an amateur!"". After I read that line, I felt that ""Fargo"" was either going to surprise me, or just make me mad. It didn't really do any of those things. And even though there was something original about it, it was clearly that it couldn't compete with Tarantino-masterpieces such as ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994) or ""Reservoir Dogs"" (1992). So I couldn't say that I liked it. But after this....the Coen-brothers came out with another film called ""The Big Lebowski"" (1998), which is among the best comedies I've ever seen, and has become one of my favorite films. So it was easier to watch ""Fargo"" for the second time. And after all...it is a pretty good film.<br/><br/>This film takes place in Minnesota, and we meet Jerry Lundegaard, who is a family-father who works at a car-firm. Jerry seems to have a bit of a money-problem, so he decides to rent someone to kidnap his wife, so that his rich father-in-law can pay the kidnappers AND (without knowing it, off course) Lundegaard a whole lot of money to free his wife. Lundegaard think this is a plan that's going to work without any problems, but as the kidnapping begins, so does the complications.<br/><br/>There's many reason to think of Quentin Tarantino when watching this film. It's a film where the characters and the dialogs are in focus, and over all it has elements that you don't find in the average American films...just like Tarantino's works. Quentin is known for borrowing (or stealing, as many prefer to say) from other films of different genres, then putting it together and blessing it with is own personality and originality. That's something the Coen-brothers also are doing.<br/><br/>When basing your film on characters, you need good actors. William Macy is doing very well in his role as the scatterbrained and pathetic Jerry Lundegaard. Steve Buscemi and Swedish actor Peter Stormare are memorable as the two kidnappers who are doing their part of messing the plan up. Frances McDormand, who received an Oscar Academy Award for her performance, plays the pregnant police-officer Marge, one of the most cosily persons I've ever seen on film...a very good performance. As for the rest of the cast, they're all doing pleasing jobs in their roles as all the funny characters you find in this film.<br/><br/>""Fargo"" is a thriller filled with a very black kind of humor, and that's probably what I like the most about it. As the story goes on and develops, it provides many intense and thrilling scenes and moments, also strong violence which tops itself during a famous and bizarre part of the film's ending. But at the same time, it has me laughing my way through it all. All the people and characters that shows up and the situations they're in are so absurd or ridiculous that I just can't stop laughing at times. Actually, the film as a whole is just peculiar enough to be appreciated by someone who wants to watch a crime-thriller which is a bit different, and has something extra to offer.<br/><br/>I have yet to see any of the films that's being regarded as the Coen-brothers' real masterpieces...""Miller's Crossing"" (1990) or ""Barton Fink"" (1991), but ""Fargo"" is definitely a film one shouldn't miss out on. It's thrilling, original, very funny and over all a quality film, though not a masterpiece as many wants to label it.<br/><br/>8.5 out of 10"

","How can you see that a movie maker has a lot of talent? Very simple: give him or her a small budget and an unknown cast to make a movie with. If the film is still any good, than you know you have found someone with more talent and brains than the average of today's Hollywood directors. Well, the Coen brothers, certainly seem to have the talent, because ""Fargo"" is more than just worth a watch. It has a good story, very nice acting as well as drama and some excellent humor to offer. They don't have to rely on special effects to make this movie work, the story, the direction and the acting have done it all by themselves.<br/><br/>Jerry Lundegaard is a hypocritical and dishonest car sales man who has a big financial problem. At first he doesn't know how to solve it, but than he has a great idea: his father-in-law is a very rich man, so Lundegaard decides that he will have his wife being kidnapped by some criminals, who are real losers. Her father will pay a lot of money to get her out of the hands of the criminals, he'll collect all the money and give a part of it to the criminals. The rest he will use to pay his debts with. But than everything goes terribly wrong and Lundegaard can do absolutely nothing about it to stop it.<br/><br/>Even though this may not be the most original movie I've ever seen, this still is one of the better. One thing that I'll always remember about this movie, next to the good acting, directing and story, is the immense amount of snow: it all looked so cold that it almost made me dive into my closet to find an extra sweater. I give this movie an 8/10. I really had a good time watching it."

","Fargo is an excellent film and it's one of my favorites. Everything about this movie is great, from the score, to the tragic plot, the dark comedy, the editing, directing, and the performances. <br/><br/>The comedy of this film is something that is perceived differently by everyone, some think it's hilarious, others don't get it, and some don't see why it's funny at all. All of the comedy is hilarious, but it takes some thought to understand certain things.<br/><br/>The plot is quite simple. A car salesman(William H. Macy) is in debt and needs money that he can't receive, so he hires two thugs to kidnap his wife, forcing her wealthy father to pay a Ransom. Quickly, everything about his plan goes completely wrong, resulting in the deaths of several people across Minnesota, caused by the kidnappers he hired. On the trail of the thugs is pregnant cop, Marge(Frances McDormand). <br/><br/>The characters are simple people, but they are very memorable. William H. Macy is excellent and very believable as the over extended car salesman, it's no wonder he was nominated for best supporting actor. Steve Buscemi, who is one of my favorite actors, is great as the kidnapper, Carl Showalter, who is trying to get money by all means possible, Frances McDormand is very deserving of her Oscar for her performance as the pregnant Midwestern cop. Another memorable character is Gaer Grimsrud(Peter Stormare). He is Carl's psychopathic associate in crime, and he is very quiet. Peter Stormare is very good, he makes a convincing sociopath, which is a difficult role to play.<br/><br/>The plot is simple, and there aren't any BIG twists that many people look for in movies, but that is part of the beauty of this film. The Coen brothers were able to weave a story of a kidnapping and murder into a film with a simple, but very involved plot.<br/><br/>The editing is very good, especially considering how visual the film is. There is one scene about an hour into the film that is very well paced and suspenseful, and a lot goes on in that scene as well. All of it is perfectly guided by the editing.<br/><br/>In my opinion, this film never gets old. The humor always stays funny, the dialog always stays clever and entertaining, and the plotting always keeps me interested. This is a gem of American cinema, and I hope you enjoy it the same way I have enjoyed it."

However, I have to say that this film is just a little bit overrated. It is an excellent comedy, but when I first saw it, I was expecting a little more. It was hilarious (those accents), however the ending was weak and I don't think it was an Oscar caliber movie. I also can't see why it is on the top 100 films of all time list according to AFI. It was like 90 or something. Comedy wise, it's right up there, but poignant films such as American Beauty, Almost Famous and Traffic are much more deserving of being on a 100 Greatest list.

","Jerry Lundegaard, a Minnesota car salesman with financial problems, has come up with what he believes will be a foolproof way of extorting money from his wealthy father-in-law, whom he dislikes. He arranges for two petty criminals to kidnap his wife Jean and hold her for ransom. The idea is that Jerry's father in law will pay the ransom, which will then be split between Jerry and the two crooks. Unfortunately, the plot misfires. After carrying out the kidnapping, the crooks' car is stopped by a policeman, whom they shoot dead in order to evade detection. Matters then get out of control, as the two inept kidnappers desperately try and cover their tracks in an ever-worsening spiral of bloodshed.<br/><br/>Although it details grisly events, the film is closer in tone to a black comedy than a crime drama or horror film. Much of the grim humour arises from the incompetence of Jerry and his two associates, who see themselves as successful criminals but in reality are simply losers, out of their league when they try to pull off a major crime. Unlike some black comedies, however, the tone of the film is not amoral or cynical. The moral order is upheld by Minnesota's own avenging angel,Marge Gunderson, the pregnant female small-town chief of police responsible for investigating the series of murders. At first sight the homely, home-loving Marge seems to be a slow, plodding rustic hick, but her determination and painstaking police work eventually prove to be the downfall of the evildoers.<br/><br/>I was interested to note that the Coen brothers are themselves from Minnesota. Although I have never visited the upper Midwest, it was clear to me that the film has a strong sense of place. The film is set in winter, and there are some eerily beautiful shots of the snow-covered Midwestern landscape. Even to a Brit like me, it was quite clear that the area has its own distinctive dialect- the word ""yes"", for example, is normally pronounced as ""yah"", presumably a result of the district's German/Scandinavian heritage- and that this dialect was being used in the film. Another factor that added to the atmospheric feel was the haunting music composed by Carter Burwell.<br/><br/>The film has an intelligent, literate script, and the acting is always of high quality. I was delighted that Frances McDormand won the Best Actress award for her portrayal of Marge- delighted because this was a deliberately unglamorous role, about as far as one can get from Hollywood's standard Charlie's Angels image of female crime-fighters. William Macy was very good as Jerry whom he portrayed not as a criminal mastermind but rather as a harassed, middle-aged businessman desperately trying any scheme, however crazy, that might ease his financial worries. The two criminals were also well played by Steve Buscemi as the neurotic, garrulous Showalter and Peter Stornare as the sullen, taciturn Grimsrud.<br/><br/>I am not too familiar with the work of the Coen brothers; of their other films I have only seen ""Intolerable Cruelty"" and the disappointing ""Miller's Crossing"". ""Fargo"", however, is a marvellous black comedy and work of a very high quality. In my view it was unlucky not to get the Best Picture award for 1997; I certainly preferred it to the dull and overlong ""The English Patient"". 8/10"
"ericolsen1953","10","0","0","30 December 2004"," Beautiful illustration of the absence of intelligence in criminals
","Evil is interesting. Fargo shows us, in stark terms, the futility of trying to pull of the Perfect Crime. If you study The Darwin Awards or DumbCriminalActs.com, you find that the criminal mind is so arrogant as to think that nothing can go wrong with their ""well-laid"" plans. And, when an auto sales-manager who thinks his manhood rests solely in how much money he makes, sets out to commit the first violent act of his life, we get a good insight into how everything can go wrong and WILL go wrong. Jerry's plot to kidnap his wife thru surrogates, thwart his father-in-law's overbearing personality, lie to his confederates about the size of the ransom demand and then profit in six-figures all comes to nothing, with a trail of dead bodies that don't immediately point to the real culprit. We learn that Jerry is no smarter or deliberate than any other felon in the big house when we spy him trying to fool GMAC about selling some non-existent cars, then trying to pocket the loan dollars. Jerry's evidently been in the trade awhile and knows better, but he's confident that he can put one over on those dopes at who loan money for a living'(not bloody likely). Now that the GMAC plot is failing, he goes ahead with a much more ambitious and dangerous scheme and let's the petty crooks he met abduct his wife from her home. We wonder if, left alone awhile longer, Jerry might feign madness and machine-gun everyone he knows in order to cover up his earlier sins. It's the honest, steady people in this wicked world who make a positive, lasting contribution to life as we know it. They're represented by Police Chief Margie Gunderson, her loving husband Norm, as well as her local cops, the bartender at the Moose Lodge, etc. My grandparents are all from Fargo & Bismark, and I'm glad that someone finally made a movie where everyone TALKS NORMAL."

","I love this film. Sometimes I watch a movie over and over just for the acting. This is one of those movies. The casting was right on. The characters are so boring and stupid, I feel sorry for them. William H. Macy is great as a defeated, desperate car salesman who needs cash fast. He hires these two bungling idiots to kidnap his wife for ransom. His wealthy father-in-law is supposed to put up the ransom money. He has an inflated ego and says ""Dammit. I want to be a part of this"". He wants to personally deliver the ransom money in hopes of not actually having to part with it. Jerry keeps uttering the same question. ""What the heck do you mean"" and you realize he doesn't have a clue. Buscemi wants money, conversation and sex. (he is kinda funny looking and uncircumsized) Stormari wants pancake house, his smokes and the car. Margie, Frances McDormand, wants her husbands artwork to be on a stamp, to have her baby and to solve a crime. She eats her way through the entire movie. Oh yes, there is the snow.

One Half of this sum will be paid back to Jerry, the other half to the kidnappers. A brilliant way to get yourself some money, isn't it?

For a start he has hired two trigger-happy crooks, the verbose Carl (Buscemi) and the taciturn Gaear (Stormare) to carry out the kidnapping. Pretty soon people are starting to get shot and this attracts the attention of the smart, pregnant police chief Marge Gunderson (McDormand, who deservedly won an Academy Award for her tough, funny, touching performance). <br/><br/>With its central plot strand of the well-planned crime spiralling wildly out of control, the film investigates similar territory to the Coen brothers' brilliant debut Blood Simple, but Fargo is a more assured work, lighter and more layered. The cast, boasting at least three scene-stealing performances (Macy, McDormand and Buscemi), are on top form. The film manages the neat trick of trumping Tarantino by not merely being filled with laughs and slickly handled, literally visceral action sequences, but also presenting rounded, recognizably human characters."

Not that this is a bad thing. Too often we're exposed to thrillers that take themselves too seriously and revel in the dark light they cast upon themselves. <br/><br/>The cast is excellent. Once again William H Macy provides a stunning performance, this time as the crafty -- yet mild mannered -- Jerry Lundegraad. Jerry works as a car salesman and as the movies starts, we learn that he's in a slight bother (as usual). He's so hard up for cash that he hires a pair of dim-witted thugs to kidnap his wife in the hope that her rich father will pay the ransom, and Jerry can get a sizeable profit from it. Predictably things go wrong on a titanic scale, and by the end of the movie, most of the main character's have been reduced to rotting carcases.<br/><br/>What makes Fargo irresistible to watch in the end is it's spellbinding photography, as we're exposed to scenes of snowy America, and the interesting and amusing characters.

Coen regulars Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare give good performances as the two kidnappers. Directing by the Coens is also superb. The barren winter landscapes on display build up a good lonely atmosphere and make the fact that all these murders are happening believable.

","spoilers <br/><br/>The Coen brothers are con men of top pedigree. They tell you that Forgo is based on a true story but it isn't. They mix up all the producing, writing and directing so you don't know who's doing what. They even throw in a fictional film editor for good measure. But isn't that what film-making is all about  using the camera to trick you into believing what you've been show.<br/><br/>Fargo shows how magic can be created out of ordinary everyday things. A car salesman scraping snow from a windshield in a snow-covered parking lot is not exactly someone that you'll stop even for a second to look at. It just so happens in Fargo that at this point, we have identified so much with this particular car salesman (William H. Macy) that his every little frustration sends vibrations through us.<br/><br/>When I pressed the play button of the DVD for Fargo, I was thinking that I was in for a suspense ride like as Se7en. It didn't take me long to realize that this was a completely different kettle of fish, and I liked it. Telling the story exactly the way it is happening, without hidden twists, the Coen brothers show how they can still throw a surprise at you at every turn. When police woman Marge (Frances McDormand) suddenly bends down beside the overturn car with a shot victim inside, as if she suddenly sees a clue, it turns out that it's morning sickness. Towards the end of the movie, approaching the hideout of the two kidnappers (Steve Buscemi, Peter Stormare) whom the audience just saw in an argument, what does Marge (and the audience) see  one of them just about finishing grinding something through a wood chipper, picking up one last foot (still in a neat white sock, with the sole facing upwards) working hard to push it down. You're at a lost whether to feel indignant or to burst out in a hilarious fit of laughs. <br/><br/>Another amazing thing is that while most good films got you empathising with the hero and/or heroin, the Coen brothers got you empathising with the whole lot of them in Fargo: the good (McDormand), the bad (Macy) and the uglies (Buscemi and Stormare), whenever its their turn on the screen. With the kidnappers, Buscemi and Stormare provide black comedy in the highest order. Macy is reminiscing of some of the clever criminals in Hitchcock's movie who has a sort of sardonic attraction that watching them scheming and plotting, you identify more and more with them. But it's McDormand who, appearing in less than half of the running time of the movie, convincingly won the Best Actress Oscar. (Macy was nominated for best supporting).<br/><br/>The few understated scenes between this earthly, pregnant policewoman and her artist husband carry more love and tenderness than all the stories in Lost Actually put together. But then, this ever smiling, ever courteous investigator can be awe-inspiring. Watch how one simple change of expression on her face sends the car salesman to flee. <br/><br/>Fargo is the sort of movie that keeps you thinking back. While the gory violence comes across as more comic than brutal, there are hidden chilly situations. The encounter with former school-day suitor Mike Yanagita starts out quite funny and ends a little soggy. But it's the subsequent phone call which reveals the truth that sends a shudder down your spine. <br/><br/>Fargo is full of wonderful surprises that delight those who can appreciate."

","Jerry Lundegaard (William H Macy) is in a financial crisis and he comes up with the idea of cooperating with a couple of wee criminals from Fargo, North Dakota to kidnap his wife and demand his wealthy father-in-law to pay the ransom so he can split the money with the kidnappers. His father-in-law is later shot dead by the abductors because he shouldn't even be the one who go see them. Then they gunned down a cop and two witnesses on the highway- things go inevitably wrong. The heavily pregnant police chief Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) is in charge with investigating a case about a stolen vehicle, which leads her to a visit with Lundegaard. Gunderson is about to uncover a chain of bloody crimes.<br/><br/>'Fargo' is a gripping, dark film and indeed, in a way, it is a comedy because at times it makes you laugh. Frances McDormand and William H Macy were quite brilliant, Steve Buscemi is funny and his quiet partner (unfortunately I can't remember or locate his name) is even funnier. The whole movie leaves you freezing, literally, not just because of the setting, but also because of the plot. I admire the Coen brothers' work, such as 'The Big Lebowski', which is very different from this one, but is dead hilarious."

","I'm a huge fan of the coens, and when I saw this movie this christmas, I was not dissapointed. As a 14 year old, one might think this movie's subtle humor and nuances and relatively relaxed pace may bore my agegroup, but I believe that this movie has a little something for everyone. SPOILER!!!!!!   From the beautiful scenery and ND/MN winter, to Steve Buscemi's fateful scene of being fed through the wood chipper, this is truly the coen's masterpiece. Frances Mcdormand does a beautiful job as margie, the (very) pregnant cop in perpetual marital bliss. She does a great job throughout, culminating with her ""for a little bit o' money"" righteous speech. William H. Macy, one of the most underappreciated actors in hollywood in my opinion, does an extraordinary job exploring the complex role of a desperate man pushed to a seemingly innocent crime, the whole time with a heavy northern midwest accent. The Coens pepper the entire thing with wonderfully subtle humour, from Mcdormand's talk to an old high school classmate to many quiet bloody jokes. The brothers directing is as usual outstanding, their intuition shines through. My favorite character of this movie is Steve Buscemi's. His foul-mouthed, chain-smoking, just me character is one of the best roles I have seen in any movie in my life. There's simply no way to describe his masterful performance that will do him service. the cream of the crop. 10/10"

Frances McDormand adds and essence of comfort and balance to this violent story, and that is not what every person can do.

That she appreciates the Academy not for recognizing her, but for acknowledging their work.

It's a story that takes place in the winter setting of North Dakota, where a man comes up with a plan to get some quick cash.  The basic idea is to hire some guys who will kidnap his wife and ask for a ransom.  He will get the ransom money from his very wealthy father in law and split the money with the kidnappers.

","How glorious it was to watch this movie again. I must have seen this movie at least twenty times already and I still don't get tired of it. I always see something new, enjoy laughing at jokes I know by heart, the enjoyment one can get out of this film is limitless...if one can allow themselves a bit of twisted humor.<br/><br/>The movie is loosely based on real events that took place in Minnesota back in 1987. (I'm not referring to the character's names because they are clearly not the same people in real life). A man (William H. Macy) hires two guys (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wife while he makes his father-in-law pay for the ransom. It's a far-fetched plan to begin with, but as the characters carry this plan out, it seems that the powers that be are making sure that this plan ends sour. Everything that can go wrong does go wrong for the kidnappers. After they kidnap the man's wife, they end up killing a patrol officer and two people who just happened to pass by. Enter Francis McDormand, a very content and very pregnant police chief, who is called in to investigate the crimes.<br/><br/>As this film carries on, we see a pretty clear juxtaposition of McDormand's character and how happy she is with her life being the way it is and how the kidnappers and everyone else involved in that plot become more and more greedy. Everybody that values money over life here seems to get their come-uppance. The kidnappers, the man, the kidnapped wife's father, everyone who places their own importance over anyone else's seems to get it in the end. For those of you who haven't seen this film, don't worry, I won't spoil the hows, just the whys.<br/><br/>On one side, it's a suspenseful thriller. At a second glance, the nuances of this movie's twisted humor shine. At another glance, the film looks epic in it's scope of a snow-swept terrain. But at the center of this movie is how getting carried away with the ""American Dream"" can become tragic.<br/><br/>The performances of Francis McDormand, William H. Macy, and Steve Buscemi are the real treats among this uncanny cast. McDormand's certainty and steadfast nature make for a perfect center point for the film. Macy plays his down-trodden loser to perfection in this movie. Buscemi makes a permanent career for himself here as the perfect weird little guy to put in any film.<br/><br/>But the biggest character of the film itself is the bleak and chilly scenery of the film and it is vividly brought to a life of it's own through cinematographer Roger Deacons, proving that he is the best living Director of Photography. Never overplaying the colors and using the natural lighting to stand out on it's own, Deacons frames and fills each shot to eerie perfection.<br/><br/>One thing that the Coen Brothers do so well is how they portray their characters at the farthest end of their rope. The characters in this film are pushed so close to the edge that it becomes both hilarious and chilling to watch the events unfold. This movie asks the audience to find humor a train wreck, not allowing the audience to blink, but allowing them to take the situation with a grain of rock salt."

","The Coen brothers movies thrive on irony so it's very apt that after their attempt at a big Hollywood picture 'The Hudsucker Proxy' flopped they went the opposite way with 'Fargo' and it turned out to be their breakthrough into the mainstream. Because this movie was such a popular success it's easy for long time fans to overlook it while praising lesser known Coen classics like 'Miller's Crossing' and 'Barton Fink'. But the thing is 'Fargo' deserved the success because it's a very fine movie and still one of the best things they ever did. I've seen it four of five times and every time I do I slap my forehead with a ""hot damn! this is GOOD!"". The acting in 'Fargo' is almost like a master class, especially from Frances McDormand and William H. Macy. McDormand is of course married to Joel Coen and co-starred in the brothers debut 'Blood Simple', but her performance as Marge Gunderson, one of the nicest cops in cinema history, really made people sit up and take notice. This is Macy's only Coen movie to date, which is a shame, because he relishes dialogue and they come up with some of the best since Macy's mentor David Mamet. Steve Buscemi also gives a comic gem of a performance as an inept kidnapper hired by Macy. It's no surprise that the Coens have worked with him so regularly, he's just great. I always say that my favourite Coen brothers movie is the most recent one I've watched, so that means this week it's 'Fargo', a brilliant movie that shouldn't be missed by any film buff. If you've seen it before, watch it again. It's the kind of movie which deserves repeated viewings."

","I don't have too many comments on FARGO (well-dissected here by others), other than to say that it's one of my favorite American films of recent years, and the definite high-water mark for the always interesting Coen brothers.<br/><br/>One of the most successful aspects of FARGO is its' agile blend of styles - modern film noir thriller, dark comedy, Americana-flavored drama, and the Coen's genuine affection for the regionalisms of America - shown here in the oft-commented-upon Minnesota accents - is on beautiful display. And - unlike some other of the Coens' films - I never got the feeling that they were looking down on their characters (which is usually true in identifiable 'regional' film).<br/><br/>The cinematography is unforgettable, making the bleakest of Minnesota's famous winters into something eerie and gorgeous (the opening scene will go down as a classic), and the razor-sharp black humor (my favorite scene: the parking deck ""Where's my daughter?"" scene, which is both brutal and very uncomfortably funny) is flawless throughout.

","This is a brilliant piece of work, made by the Coen Brothers, who are known for turning out good (if bizarre and sometimes shocking) work. This is a thriller with shockingly graphic violence, and humor as black as coal. It is made even more shocking by the fact that the movie was inspired by true events. A sleazy but mild-mannered car salesman who hires a couple of criminals to kidnap his wife with the intention of keeping most of the ransom provided by his father-in-law. Things turn bad when one of the kidnappers shoots a State Trooper and two witnesses, leading seven-months-pregnant Brainerd, Minnesota Chief of Police Marge Gunderson to investigate the killings.<br/><br/>The cast is stellar. William H. Macy, as the hapless car salesman, gives arguably his best performance. Frances McDormand won an Oscar for her portrayal of Marge. Steve Buscemi, in one of his best roles from his mid-nineties crime movies, plays loud-mouthed, inept, ""funny-looking"" Carl Showalter. Peter Stormare, as the silent, stone-faced psycho-partner of Buscemi, is positively chilling. Unlike every Coen bros. movie since ""Blood Simple,"" Fargo takes a more serious, less bent look at things. And the hilarious regional dialect, which can be obnoxious at times, adds humor and culture to the isolation of the setting. One thing that makes little sense is the title.

Coen regulars Frances McDormand, Peter Stormare, and Steve Buscemi all do a fabulous job. William H. Macy does his character so well that this role will follow him the rest of his career.

","Spoilers.<br/><br/>I think it is unique that a film as simple as this one has so much to say. It is presented unlike any conventional film you will find in the genre. Most screen-writing conventions require that each scene advance the plot and develop the characters. This is precisely what this film does, but to call it conventional would be a malapropism. The brilliance of what the Coen brothers have done here is the way they wrote scenes that contain the insight and density of a great novel then presented them on film in the simplest possible way. <br/><br/>All the actors gave some of their most memorable performances of their life. Indeed, the characters themselves are not the type to be forgotten easily. You have a quiet psychotic, a selfish weasel, a dishonest and dumb car salesman, a grumpy father-in-law and a smart and honest police woman. What an ensemble! And each character is put in situations where their most basic characteristics are shown. For example, Carl (Buscemi) is seeing a show with an escort and he calls the waiter, who doesn't respond. He then says to her `What is he, deaf?' <br/><br/>Fargo' quite rightly deserved the Oscar nomination for best film editing, as well as all the Oscars is actually won. A lot of scenes are covered from only two simple angles, and establishing shots are very basic set-ups next to the road. This sounds like the way A Simple Plan' was shot, but in Fargo' the cuts are exceptionally well timed. Sort of like musical notes.<br/><br/>
I don't think it is easy for people to validate any criticism they have of this film. It is one of the most memorable films I have ever seen. I wish more people would recognize it as the underrated masterpiece that it is."

","Since there's no IMDb listing for the ""Fargo"" television spinoff that never made it to air, I'm placing my comments for it here.<br/><br/>The Trio network's ""Brilliant But Cancelled"" series is hosting all sorts of interesting pilots, including some odd but intriguing shows like one with Adam West called ""Lookwell"" and this dramedy that follows the still-pregnant Marge Gunderson, now played by, off all people, Edie Falco.  I don't know what network turned down this series (it had a CBS vibe), but, based on the one episode produced, I'd say it had a lot of potential.<br/><br/>The pilot follows Marge as she investigates three crimes in small-town Brainerd:  a rather bloody murder whose evidence consists of home-made shell casings and size-8 footprints in the snow; a stolen boat and possible insurance scam; and a missing, frozen corpse.  The latter two turn out to be connected, as the son of the dead guy stole his father's body in order to give him a Viking funeral, which apparently requires the body to be burned on a lake in a wooden boat.  The murder investigation seemed underdeveloped, but I missed five minutes of the hour-long show while making dinner so maybe not.  The show ends with Marge giving birth in an abandoned building with Deputy Lou at her side with husband Norm looking in through a window.  (Lou is the same actor as in the movie, but Norm is played by That Guy from IN THE COMPANY OF MEN.  No, not Aaron Eckhart - the other one.)<br/><br/>""Fargo"" the Pilot wasn't great, but how many first episodes are?  (Look at how dull ""The Seinfeld Chronicles"" is.)  The same beautiful music score used in the movie is here, and the show captured the same darkly comedic tone as the Coen Bros. Oscar-recipient.  Falco's Marge was nearly identical to Frances McDormand's (she didn't seem as intuitive, though) , and the folksy accents and charm were abundant.  <br/><br/>I even spotted someone that should be a bigger star, and maybe would be if this show was picked up.  He was sort of an Anthony LaPaglia lookalike who played the younger brother of the guy who stole his dad's body.  His first scene is of him learning of his father's death, and his near-silent interpretation of the tumult of emotions inside him was heartbreakingly precise and real.  I couldn't take my eyes off him.  Who is this guy? Unfortunately, Trio didn't air the closing credits of the show, so his identity remains in limbo.  His character may not have been a regular on the show, but surely he'd move on to bigger things had the pilot been aired.  A shame."

","To me, Fargo, is the Coen brothers ""family values"" movie. Who really comes out happy in the end? Marge and her husband. They have an untraditional marriage with Marge as the stable breadwinner and her husband the artist, but seem blissfully tho' undramatically happy(Read: ignore the TV ads and just live as if there were no media by which to judge oneself). Gunderson's father-in-law undervalues his son-in-law, who lives down to his expectations. I got the impression that the father-in-law's disapproval causes Gunderson's actions more than Gunderson's actions caused the F-i-l's disapproval. People do tend to rise or fall to meet our expectations. Gunderson places less value on his family than on success at any cost, as does his father-in-law, who undercuts Gunderson's idea and co-opt his project. He has no concept of caring for another person's self-esteem and giving the other guy credit where credit is due. For christ's sake, this is his daughter's husband and the father of his grandson! Marge's old high school friend is devastated by life, and in the hotel bar we see Marge flustered for the only time in the film. Why? Because dysfunction is a mystery to her. Marge, Midwest solid, does her job, supports her husband's artistic ambitions (and is rewarded when his stamp design wins the contest), earns the close-to-the-vest respect of her Minnesota peers, catches the bad guy with little drama/melodrama, and all while 50 months pregnant! Talk about affirmation! Life is good if you value what's lasting and true - family values - and do your best. In the prowler in the end, we see Marge confused by the motivations of such as the thugs. Goodness cannot conceive of dysfunction/evil,nor understand the dysfunctional/evil. (One exception to the theme might be the poor sod who gets blown away doing his job working the parking garage. God is unpredictable.) Blessedly, though I am a Texan, I was living in St. Paul, Minnesota during the first run of the film and got to experience many local's reactions to it. I believe the movie is a paean to the values I found to be quite pervasive in St. Paul and in Minnesota-generally. Also the ambiance in the movie was so evocative of my experience of Minnesota winter. The weather IS trying to kill you. One must stick to the basics to just survive. Another insight: Macy plays his character as though he were an eight year old boy - his blundery lies, his naive attempts to exit the window and hold onto the door jamb when being arrested, etc. Watch his performance with that in mind. An actor has to have something to ""play"" and I think that's what Macy does with this part.<br/><br/>All in all: what a fable and morality play for our times.

Each one of the actors fits perfectly for the role assigned to him/her. Secondly, it is abundant in innocence: Though the deeds of the villainous characters are contemptuous to the highest degree, they, along with of course, the `YA' -ing Frances Mc Dormand seem as lovable as Winnie The Pooh! Thirdly, it has an abundance of brilliant photographic shots: The shots, mainly capturing frosty harsh landscapes, in every mood, from every angle, are not only awe-inspiring, but also perfectly fit the downcast and stolid mood of the movie.<br/><br/>Above everything else, the movie is more abundant in subtlety, more than anything else. This flick is supposed to be a thriller. But, it is more humorous than it is violent; though it's few violent moments are really shocking. However, even in the violent scenes, there is a delicate humor, hidden somewhere in the scene. Though done deliberately, the movie is fraught with subtle humor, which gives the flick, a charming personality. The acting is brilliant, in the manner that just the straight faces and controlled emotions of the actors are enough to make us laugh, in the most serious situations. A prime example of the kind of outré humor in this movie, is the scene where Steve Buscemi, a crook, has a business-like conversation with a prostitute while hiring her for the night, in which he asks her whether she gets job-satisfaction in this profession or not: all in a manner, which seems as if two company executives are discussing the NASDAQ!<br/><br/>Seeing Marge Gunderson, (played by Frances McDormand) a beady-eyed seemingly innocuous sweet and homely cop, solve the crime with the encumbrance of pregnancy, is quite a change to the quintessential smart-aleck cop who arrives at a solution, in a trice over a cup of coffee.

Macy) and his naïve wife Jean (Kristin Rudrud) or the super-cop `Margie' and her hubby, has this little goofy innocence, which adds to the humor of this anomalously dark and comical thriller.<br/><br/>The clever mélange of the unique set of characters made to act in an even more unique way (especially the `YA'-laden accents), the outrageously subtle humor, and the grossly funny violence make the movie, humorous and subfusc, all at the same time. A movie, way far from the ordinary, FARGO deserves a heartening applause.<br/><br/>Rating-10/10"

","Looking at the film based on a real story and facts, I was asking myself where the man would like to arrive in certain societies. Love for your wife and/or husband, for your children, parents, other relatives an close friends is always more valuable than any money. The main man in the film, Jerry Lundegaard, was able to organize an act of kidnapping his wife with two gangsters in order to get half a million US$ for him and another half for the gangsters. The result was fatal at all, his wife and father-in- law killed by the gangsters and he himself discovered and caught finally by the police. This Lundegaard had no ethics, no love for anyone including his son, and no brain at all. The idea of making and presenting such films is really, it probably may help some people (with brains) to think about and not to kill or burn themselves and their families for money."

","Having heard of the movie and it's Oscar success, but never known anything about it, I watched with an unusual lack of preconception. I didn't really know any of the actors by name, although many I do recognise visually and that probably helped me keep an open mind. If Meryl Streep played the lead then somehow I would have expected something specific, but in this case what emerged from my TV was a real curiosity and a darkly charming one! It's an apparently serious film but laced with some wickedly dark comedy and tongue-in-cheek sequences. The characters are great,they have depth and human interest, even the silent hit man! The acting is naturalistic and deadpan, the casting is spot-on perfect. Despite several huge shocks along the way the fairly simple and uncomplicated plot moves quickly and effortlessly to a rather satisfactory conclusion.In many ways thats a surprise in itself and yet at no time is this a flashy or overboard piece of movie making,it's restrained and controlled, and all the better for it.And it's great entertainment. A credit to all involved. The opening shot of a car approaching in a near white-out sets up the snow-bound feel of the movie. The bleak, frozen wastes of Minnesota have a slightly other-worldy aura about them which adds immeasurabley to the overall atmosphere. The towns of Fargo and Brainard in winter seem like frontier outposts and the action which follows has a strong Western overtones. Frances McDormand is quite brilliant as the pregnant local police chief, Marge, with a home-life so prosaic and a delivery so earnest that you swear you must have met this woman somewhere yourself! Her ability to be funny without apparently trying is such a refreshing change from the ""Friends"" style of comedy (say your line, pull a face and wait for the laugh before resuming)that now riddles Hollywood. And her dialogue is brilliantly written. The peculiarities of the Minnesota accent where it seems everyone has a Scandinavian name and says ""oh yahh"" are played to the hilt (sorry to any residents reading this if I sell your state short, I'm from England so please forgive my lack of background knowledge). The scene in which Marge interviews two hookers amid a chorus of ""ohh yahhh""s is hilarious. Only one thing in the script annoyed me, the constant and repeated reference by one character to another by their names. How many times did the Brainard cop, who discovers the initial dead bodies, call his chief ""Margie"" ? In Every single line, virtually. That was the only flaw. In real life people on familiar everyday terms don't keep using each other's names in that way. It's a trick straight out of bad soap-opera where the idea is to make the viewer remember who everyone amid the cast of hundreds actually is. Otherwise this was a brilliantly written, acted, directed and photographed movie. If you havn't seen it, rest assured it's not at all what you are expecting!"
"famsmith","9","0","0","22 July 2003"," A Hero with a Heart
","Fargo comes with the works.  A wonderfully original and quirky script by Joel and Ethan Cohen which at the same time is more accessible, sensible, and down to earth than any one of their other films.  Fargo is not a cult classic it is a mainstream triumph.  With precise and vivid photography by Roger Deakins (The Shawshank Redemption, Kundun, Dinner With Friends, The Hurricane and numerous Cohen brothers' films).  Great performances from Steve Buscemi, Frances McDormand and William H. Macy.  And relatively unique editing that was actually written into the script, at times the Cohen brothers employ hard cuts to black which breaks up the rhythm and extraordinarily makes you think.  However, it is really Frances McDormand's performance that gives this film its strength.  In my opinion a strange thing has happened with Fargo.  From time to time there is a film that is a great film, but catches on for the wrong reasons.  Many people talked about Fargo as a comedy which it certainly was not despite a comic touch that exists throughout the Cohen brtohers' work.  Others went around acting like fools saying ya, oh ya, you bet, and real good then, as if the unusual accents were what made the film distinctive.  What makes this film brilliant is not the funny accents, the quirky characteristics, the offbeat manners. For me the greatness of this film is revealed in the last couple of scenes. (SPOILERS AHEAD!!!)  When Marge finds Grimsrud and is put in harm's way by doing her job I can not think of a more gripping anxiety filled scene. Honestly when was the last time that there was a chase scene where you were really emotionally invested in what was taking place?  Then in the car when Marge talks to the automatonic Grimsrud you are glad and relieved that for once with all do respect to Dirty Harry that it is a normal, kind hearted, well adjusted, affable human being who has captured this monster so that we may receive catharsis through her words of insight which are uniquely similar to what most of us would say.  It is as if Marge is articulating what we have often thought or even said, but lacked a pulpit to preach from and a congregation to preach to.  That scene near the end of the film when we are in the car with Marge and Grimsrud to me is more than a catharsis though, it is an indictment of the loss of American values, it is an indictment of our seemingly insatiable appetite for gratuitous blood and mindless violence, and our propensity for greed.  When Marge says, 'and for what for a little money.  There's more to life than a little money you know,' you feel as if something has been restored and lost at the same time. Marge would be seen by many as a sentimental character, but that is because the world has grown cynical.  Is she oversimplifying in that scene?  No she's right and we're the ones who are lost.  That is if you believe films like dreams are keys to our unconscious and indicative of our true fears and desires."

","...with crime movies like Fargo, the thing that usually makes them great is how intense they are.  Fargo isn't intense, it's just too cute.  It's like a children's film disguised as a crime tragedy.  Sure, there are some suspenseful parts, but there weren't enough.<br/><br/>Overall it was still a good movie, the acting was grade A from Frances McDormand, William H. Macy, Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare.<br/><br/>Despite McDormand's great performance, I'd have to say my favorites were by the three criminals: William H. Macy, Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare. Macy makes you feel sorry for him as the man reluctantly having his wife kidnapped, he really portrays the 'too stupid for his own good' thing.<br/><br/>Buscemi is basically playing Mr. Pink again, but just a little less nervous as the talkative amateur crook Carl Showalter.  Though, Buscemi being my favorite actor, I still thought his role was great.  Stormare's acting wasn't really the best, but he was believable as the quiet but violent bad guy.<br/><br/>Good movie, entertaining at least, 7.5/10."

He is more weak and feckless<br/><br/>than malevolent, and although he sets this carnage in motion, he is not<br/><br/>ultimately responsible for the turn it takes. His wife is much the nonentity and certainly does little for his self-esteem.

However, he certainly doesn't deserve to get shot.The two kidnappers are great studies in abnormal psychology, the Marlboro Man is<br/><br/>a classic psychopath. The nerd is a classic loser and screw-up trying to act like a tough guy. One suspects he has been brutalized since childhood and most<br/><br/>especially in prison. The Indian, the two hookers and the escort service cutie are really well done. You can't help feeling sorry for them.  The pregnant lady sheriff is almost perfect.

"Dinjack","10","0","0","25 May 2003"," Best. Movie. EVER.
","Spoilers be here.<br/><br/>I first saw Fargo around 7 months ago, from that day forward it has been my absolute favorite movie. Fargo is accessible, because it's the story of an everyday guy (Jerry) who needs money, so he hires a couple other everyday guys to kidnap his everyday wife, who end up shooting an everyday state trooper, and so on and so forth.<br/><br/>I choose not to view Fargo as a comedy, even though it has quite a few funny moments. I see Fargo as a story of real life. When you think about it, Fargo is one of the most realistic movies out there. It's the Hamburger Hill of thrillers. Like I said, Fargo is about people who aren't really smart (well, except for Marge I guess) doing things that aren't very well thought out. And there isn't a whole lot of drama to the things they do that make them more exciting and less realistic. For example, Marge doesn't fight off 20 ninja assassins in the field where she finds the dead bodies. Jerry doesn't pull out Uzis and have a 10 day standoff with police in the hotel at the end of the movie. Marge's husband (even though I love Fargo I can't remember his name) doesn't win the stamp competition. No, Fargo shows what life really is like, without a whole lot of needless drama. And yet, somehow, there IS drama, in the imagery. Like when Jerry is walking to his iced over car in the building parking lot. The scene is shot from above, and for a few seconds it looks like it's a picture because of the stillness until Jerry walks into frame. Or when Steve Buscemi drives into the airport parking lot to steal new plates for his car. Or when Marge shoots at the fleeing Peter Stormare as he runs across the frozen lake. Fargo's drama comes from compelling imagery, and not suspension of disbelief.<br/><br/>Yeah, that didn't make sense, but you can pretend it did."

He's a really lamentable figure, and<br/><br/>probably tied for best character in the film with that of Frances McDormand, who uses sensibility and ""Minnesota nice"" to bring justice to the guilty.<br/><br/>Of course, the whole Scandinavian accent thing is really overdone in this film, but to good effect.

","Fargo isn't exactly an exciting idea. Sure there's a lot of conflict, but it doesn't shock or grab the viewers attention. So the Coen brothers decided to fill it to the brim with an excellent script and very sharp performances. And it worked. Fargo succeeds in nearly all levels of film, the direction, the writing, the acting. Frances Mcdormand won an Oscar for her portrayal as a small time cop, her performance is both sweet and effective, utter perfection too. William H. Macy lost to Cuba Gooding Jr. but I strongly felt Macy deserved it. Every little detail on his face is so perfectly acted out, you know this character and feel him. Steve Buscemi is good here, but isn't exactly oscarworthy. The script keeps a tight net on all characters, and the direction was good too. The only real flaw with Fargo is that some scenes feel out of place and the acting sometimes falls apart. It's rated R because there are a couple of heavy sex scenes, quite a bit of graphic violence, and some swearing. The only reason I give it this score is because of personal choice. 9.5/10"
"WriterDave","10","0","0","4 March 2003"," The Ultimate Coen Brothers' Movie and one of the Best Films Period
","Here's the brilliant duality of ""Fargo."" You can watch it as so many claim it is to be intended, as a comedy, and thoroughly enjoy yourself (I especially love when Marge is interrogating the girls from the bar). However, was this really how the film was intended to be viewed? This is an inherent problem with many Coen brothers' films. Their movies are always so lovingly filmed, meticulously crafted, and beautifully photographed, that you are often shocked that they seem to treat their characters and stories with such a light handed and often mocking touch. ""Blood Simple"" and ""Miller's Crossings"" were the dramatic exceptions (no doubt, these are not comedies) and ""Raising Arizona,"" ""The Big Lebowski,"" and ""Oh, Brother Where Art Thou?"" operate at the other end of the spectrum (these are all great comedies). All of their other films fall oddly in between. <br/><br/>This ""Fargo"" is probably the strangest as it claims to be inspired by true events and follows many of the same dramatic twists as ""Blood Simple."" Yes, I think we are supposed to laugh at the accents, and Jerry Lundegard (as played so brilliantly by William H. Macy) is so inept at everything and such a weaselly prick you can't help but laugh. But ""Fargo"" is also operating on some higher level as an archetypal battle between good and evil (law abiding citizens making an honest living and criminals killing for money). I have no doubt that Marge Gunderson (the pitch perfect Frances McDormand) is supposed to be viewed as a heroine of the most noble order. In the end there is justice, and Marge dispenses to our captured killer the moral of it all while taking him away in the police car. ""There's more to life than that (referring to money)."" Dontchya know? And isn't that the moral we all need to be reminded of in this capitalist society? Dontchya know indeed."

","Having grown up 80 miles north of Fargo, I can say that the film Fargo contains many inside jokes that quietly (or not so quietly) remind one that she is watching a movie about that part of the country.  And whatever people think of the acting, story, etc., Fargo does capture much of the anxiety that the great plains quietly thrusts on those who live there (you can see this in the way Jean chops veggies), often hidden behind a smile or seemingly polite word.<br/><br/>One might note that this is a picture of mostly suburban Minnesota, around the twin cities, not rural. The film may have been better entitled ""Edina"" or ""Maple Grove"".  Also, the accents, funny as they may be to most outside of the area, sound a little more like southwestern Wisconsin than North Dakota or Minnesota.  Phrases such as ""you're darn tootin"" have never, to my knowledge, been knowingly been said by anyone in Minnesota.

And what a joy she is to behold in this film.<br/><br/>Just a little while ago I was a part of the group that saw this film as the greatest achievement of the 90s, but now I'm not so sure. After recently catching the first bit of ""Barton Fink"" on TV again (and after being introduced to Faulkner -- I'll finish reading about Benji, I swear...) I now see that as their masterpiece. Everything about that film, from Turturro's hair to the sound the wallpaper makes to the clever writing on the hotel stationary comes as a sudden burst of brilliance.<br/><br/>When the Coens are in their genre-tinkering mode I'm not always a fan. In the moment it's great fun, but afterwards I want to spit. But when they are in their element as filmmakers as they are here, in ""Fink"" and ""Lebowski"" they are shockingly good.<br/><br/>And let's not forget Carter Burwell's climactic theme!<br/><br/>Much has been said about Roger Deakins' wonderful photography, I presume, by people unaccustomed to snow.

The guy who plays Macy's father is a charm.<br/><br/>Charles Taylor, the aggresively stupid critic for Salon says that the characters in this film exist only to be ridiculed. Untrue. Take Buscemi for example. Not only does he die like in most Coen movies, but here he's: beat up, shot in the face, hit with an axe and put through a wood-chipper. Stormare? Only shot in the leg. McDormand? Only observed as she's about to (but never does) puke. Macy? Arrested in his underpants. The Asian dude? Watched as he breaks down emotionally. Macy's father? Shot in the gut. The list goes on.<br/><br/>But the Coens don't get any pleasure out of the screen violence this time around. That's ""Miller's Crossing,"" remember? No, here it serves a purpose. Blood looks good on snow.<br/><br/>I still think the film is too short, but just long enough.

Either you like the Coen Brothers or you don't - no need to get personal!<br/><br/>I am a fan, and anyone who thinks they could sit down and write a Coen script over a few beers with their mates should try doing that some time. They are geniuses of the understatement and write the kind of observant blackly humourous dialogue I would kill to be able to write, (not-with-standing improvisational leeway with their always top-notch casts).<br/><br/>However I don't indiscriminately love everything they do.  Films like 'The Big Lebowski'  and 'O Brother' don't seem to hit the mark for me.  But 'Blood Simple' and 'Fargo' are so brilliantly real and surreal at the same time I get a total high every time I see them.<br/><br/>'Fargo' is just great entertainment as far as I'm concerned.  Frances McDormand and William H. Macy are amazing and Steve Buscemi is just always great.  And by the way - it's not a true story - they were kidding."

","I revisited this recently and was again delighted with it on every level. Frances McDormand plays the police chief, Marge Gunderson,  and plays her to perfection down to the flat Scandinavian accent sprinkled with ""Ya's"". William H. Macey plays the sleazeball car salesman who is in trouble with GMAC for getting loans on vehicles for which he has no serial numbers. He comes up with the ingenious scheme of having his wife kidnapped for a ransom from his fatherinlaw who is very wealthy and treats his son-in-law as an incompetent. the story takes off from there, twisting and turning in incredible but believable directions, victims dropping like flies. At the core of the movie is pregnant Marge and her painter husband Norm, secure in their domestic bliss.  Marge goes out to solve this multiple homicide fiasco, Norm stays home and paints ducks for a postage stamp competition. Some of the scenes are to be seen to be believed and we are shocked out of complacency at times with some pretty graphic violence, and Marge gets her man in the end and does not hesitate to philosophize in the police car at him.  A 9 out of 10. Do not miss this one. In my personal top 100 best of all time."

","This film is a fine, fine, piece of cinema from a couple of the neatest, slickest and most original directors in the business. Only one thing stops it from claiming its rightful place among the industry's finest - that makes it a great film rather than a classic film - and that's that it's too damn short! Admittedly, it doesn't cut you off with the same degree of frustrating incompletion that, say, 'Unbreakable' does, but to compare the two films at all would be insulting to the Coens. All the same though, the style and quality of the film just makes its brevity all the worse. Frances McDormand turns in one of the finest acting performances of recent years as the just-too-damn-smart detective, and the whole film is staged superbly - the Coen brothers' creation of a very dark movie in a very white setting is slick to the point of arty, but engaging enough to become too over-indulgently picturesque. The film is neat, clipped and wonderfully aesthetic. The comedy is as dark as it comes, but all the same entertaining - you find yourself laughing out loud at stuff you might feel you really shouldn't; it's more of an atmosphere of set-piece humour at times in the film, rather than anything deliberately comic about the script. So hey, maybe I'm being slightly picky about criticising the abrupt end to the film. Maybe it shouldn't really be any longer - perhaps to be longer would be to be make 'Fargo' less well-formed, and that would be unforgivable. I suppose it's just a personal thing - as a tragic product of the MTV generation I was hoping for a more dramatic ending, though the classic 'disposal' scene certainly added a certain uniqueness to the film, though it would be shame if such a fine work were to be remembered for just a woodchipper. Again coming from an MTV-generation point of view, I suppose the one thing this film lacks is a feeling of suspense, an adrenalin rush of some kind. But then a film doesn't need that sort of thrill factor to be good. This is not a film you see if you want the kind of high-octane entertainment that, say, 'Bad Boys' or 'Terminator' will supply. Having said that, I can think of few people who would crack open the beers and watch 'Schindler's List' with a pizza - this is a film treat, an artistic, phenomenally slick and polished work with a well-picked, select cast that features not a single wooden line, and along with McDormand's masterful performance there are fine roles by Buscemi and Macy as the cuss-filled crook and the chirpy-to-the-point-of-irritating loser car salesman who hires him. A great lesson in how to make a film - the plot is very simple, but the way it unravels, as well as the style of the piece as a whole, make Fargo a winner. Watch with a glass of something warming, while in a contemplative, patient mood for best results."

","Ah, there are just some things in life that I will never be able to fully understand. This movie is one of them. FARGO begins with a lie right away, claiming to be ""Based on a True Story""- I later found out that this was indeed a lie. *Spoilers*<br/><br/>Jerry Lundergaard (William H. Macy) is short on money. So, hiring two criminals (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) he tells them to kidnap his wife and to get a large ransom from his wealthy father-in-law. When they unintentionally kill three locals, things turn upside-down, especially when the pregnant Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) steps in to investigate.<br/><br/>
Now, many things are wrong with the film. The biggest and worst thing to happen to the film is probably the god-awful accents that many members of the cast put on. ""Is there a payphone 'round here, ya think?"", much unnecessary sexuality which is in the movie for no apparent reason. And the film is about a half hour too short. Most films of this genre run anywhere from two hours to two and a half hours long. I thought this was going to be a nice, scary suspense thriller, but even during the sequences that are intended to be thrilling and intense, things just roll along like how they have been during the boring moments. The Coen Brothers even gave it a biting sense of humor to go with the plot that just doesn't stick. It would have been so much better if they had just made it turn dark and scary a few times. But, keeping that happy-go-lucky feel, it just doesn't seem like you are watching a thriller. FARGO: 4/5."

","The Coen brothers are some of my all time favorite directors (along with Christopher Nolan, M. Night. Shyamalan and Christopher Guest).  All of their movies are comical and original and in many ways, strange.  Fargo is arguably one of the neatest films they have ever made.<br/><br/>  Here's the synopsis (Warning: spoilers):  Jerry Lubdergaard (William H. Macy) is a car salesman in debt.  He needs the money but his wife's (Kristin Gudrud) father (Harve Presnell) has it and won't give it to him.  So he comes up with a clever plan, also a dangerous one, to hire two guys, Carl (Steve Buscemi) and Gaear (Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wife.  That way he can get the ransom money from the father-in-law, keep half of it, give the other half to the kidnappers, and pay off his debts.  It goes well until Gaear shoots a state trooper near Brainerd (as well as two people who witnessed it) and are now being chased by policewoman Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand).<br/><br/>  Throughout the entire film it is dramatic yet oddly hysterical in places people might not consider funny.  Gaear casually chasing and killing Carl with the ax, beforehand adjusting his hat in the freezing North Dakotan weather.  When they arrest Jerry after he flees from the Twin Cities.  When Marge captures Gaear and tells him in the car ""There's more to life than money y'know?  Didn't you know that?""  The ending is very realistic.  In a way it is miserable (at least for some of the characters) but in a way it is happy.<br/><br/>  This film is beautifully shot (for anyone who has ever driven across North Dakota in any kind of weather, it does feel like you are in the middle of nowhere) and the musical score was excellent.  The casting was superb (Frances McDormand rightfully deserved that Oscar).  I give it a 10 out of 10.  And if you liked this, rent the Big Lebowsky; it is just as good."

","The Coen Brothers have always been my favorite directors. They are about the only worthy protocessors to the almighty Stanley Kubrick.When I first saw Fargo I must admit I was not paying much attention to it.I was talking on the phone with a friend and because of it I entirely missed the magic. A couple months later I saw it and it completely blew my expectations away. The rural setting of Minnesota and its people provide the perfect juxtaposition for this mixed up murder thriller.The endless snowy landscpes and frigid cold create a great mood for a sullen and intoxicating climax. My favorite part of this film was definetly the subtle craftsmanship. The violin music. The editing. Frances McDormand's performance. Peter Stormare' performance. I especially loved the axe scene. It made Stormare almost into a larger than life character. He was Paul Bunyan. And in the end it was a little old pregnant police woman that took him down. This film is about as perfect as you can get. The only action thriller that even comes close to it is Memento. Years from now this will be seen as one of America's greatest Post Modern Films. ***** You're darn tootin."

","I absolutely loved Fargo.  Every bit of acting is great, the script is inspired, the humor fits my taste perfectly (you may not feel the same way), the direction is, of course, flawless (I'd expect nothing less from a titan like Joel Coen), and the music is great (especially Carter Burwell's theme); this film is an example of when everything falls together perfectly and a masterpiece is created.<br/><br/>I'd also just like to say that Frances McDormand is the best actress I can think of right now.  Her performance in Fargo is one of the best (female or male) that I've seen in a really long time.  She was also good in ""Almost Famous"" (I suggest you watch the DVD version called ""Untitled"" if you haven't seen it yet, it's a lot longer, but the vision is more developed) and she was good in ""The Man who Wasn't There""."
"Rob Paul","Null","0","0","7 July 1999"," Over-rated but still better than most...
","The Coen Brothers can take the simplest plot ideas and weave truly magical movies. Raising Arizona, Blood Simple and the Hudsucker Proxy manage this concept, but Fargo just falls short in some respects. However, that shouldn't detract from what is essentially an extremely well crafted character study.<br/><br/>The real key to making this movie work is in the inspired casting. I didn't rate William Macy that much until I seen him in this movie, and he pulls off a performance that really makes you believe in his own predicament and one that should have received more recognition. While the cast are well above average, the movie is really stolen by Frances McDormand, finally bagging a deserved oscar in the process.<br/><br/>The only real problems with this movie lie in the pacing, which at times drags the movie down a notch or two. In addition, some scenes seemed out of place and felt added in as a sideshow.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, the Coen Brothers always make enjoyable movies, films that while some regard as slow-moving, others can manage to find a depth that is lacking from most movies these days.<br/><br/>8/10."

","In a time where big Hollywood productions with incredibly banal characters and plots are dominating movie media, it is refreshing to watch a masterpiece such as Fargo.  Everything about this movie is amazing, but what intrigued me the most was the dialog.  I'm from a province in Canada that is located directly above North Dakota and am therefore familiar, and sometimes find myself using, the dialog style or accent that was used superbly in this film.  Not only is the dialog amazing, but the performances of Bill Macey and Frances McDormand  are two of the best I have ever seen.  To truly appreciate the accuracy of the screenplay and performances in Fargo you should visit North Dakota or Western Canada someday.  I'm sure you'll laugh if you happen to overhear the smalltalk (it's pretty darn cold eh). Besides the incredible originality and accuracy of the settings and characters, the Coen brothers create this plot that seems so out of place in this small quiet community of farmers and shop owners.  And yet what makes it so intriguing is the fact that such evil and deceit could occur in such a harmless environment.  I recommend that everybody see this movie and appreciate it for the many things (little and  big) that it does so well."

He plays such a dislikable, cloying worm that the image sticks with me when I see him in other films. But at the end, I still am able to sympathize with him, and truly feel sorry for his decent into the gutter. (There but for the grace of God go any of us).<br/><br/>The plot is simple but it is the delivery that makes the movie great. Fargo takes you to a barren North Dakota winter and makes it come alive. The cinematography is amongst the best you will ever see, making interesting and captivating images out of nothing.<br/><br/>Pay close attention to the final scene - it is pure genius. On the surface, it seems detached from the movie, but deep down, it is one of the great pieces of character development in film history. In two minutes of ""non-plot-related"" dialogue, you learn a great deal about the main character - who she is inside.<br/><br/>What a great movie. **** out of ****"

","My mother loves documentaries and films based on true stories. My brother and I brought home ""Fargo"" on VHS the day it came out, and we watched the film as a family, and when the words ""Based on a true story"" came up, she declared, ""Oh good!"" My brother and I just looked at each other smiling. We knew the truth. this was fiction, but we said nothing. I say this without fear of spoiling it for two reasons. Chances are you already knew it was fictional by now, a certain advantage of commenting on the film years later. Secondly, it really doesn't matter. The film is great, any way you look at it. My mother disagrees, she feels that you shouldn't be able to say it's a true story if it's not. Nevertheless, she enjoyed the film.<br/><br/>I support the Coen brothers in their choice to have some fun. More of that can be found if you check the credits carefully, you'll see the symbol for the artist-formerly-known-as-Prince exists as a credit for the rather heavyset driver that is pursued by Peter Stromare. An unlikely match, but amusing considering Prince is from Minnesota, just like the Coen brothers are.<br/><br/>What is so effective about ""Fargo"" is that despite it's fantastic content, it never loses the air of believability. I think most people forget about the little proclamation at the film's beginning by the time ten minutes have passed. My mother is not one of those people mind you. These brothers excel at story telling, and it's done so convincingly, you don't question it for a minute.<br/><br/>Another interesting aspect of ""Fargo"" is its wide appeal. I never would've guessed that this would be the breakthrough film for the Coen Brothers. The Hudsucker Proxy was a sheer delight for me, and I consider it one of my favourite films, but it essentially flopped. It is fortunate that things finally turned around for the creative team of Joel and Ethan, with the unanimous success, praise and awards for ""Fargo"". They have a certain independent spirit that doesn't seem easy to crush. They do things just a little differently, and that's why they stand out as not only thoughtful filmmakers, but also somewhat masters of their own destiny. Marching to the beat of their own drum. I applaud them for it, and eagerly await the next demonstration of their commitment to superlative cinema."

It is also very violent, something that happens all too frequently in Paul Bunyan's America.  Frances McDermond was great, and deserves the Oscar she got.  If I can find fault with the movie it is the scene where the 'old friend' tries to con Margie into starting a relationship.  The only possible purpose for such a scene would be to give more depth to the Margie character, but it is mostly distracting.

The first group of people would go to a movie theater wanting to shy away from the real world, and the second group of people will recognize reality in a movie if they see one.  Fargo struck a cord with me (and I guess, those who nominated it for the Oscars) because it portrays reality in its true, stark, and unabridged form, which is often times as insensible as the killing of innocent passers-by, as confusing as the characterization of Stomare and Buscemi (they are both criminals but very different in their personalities), as as cold and barren as a North Dakota winter.  There is no complicated plot, a lot of the events  are purely circumstantial (e.g., McDormand's spotting of the Sierra prior to the final climax), and there are too many gory scenes (e.g., the woodchipper scene) and liberal use of that despised four-letter word, but ain't that how life is in reality, especially in the rural areas of the USA?<br/><br/>I'm no critic to say whether Francis McDormand deserved an Oscar, but I can certainly say that the portrayal of her character, along with those of William Macy (think about your typical car salesman/conman), Buscemi, and Stomare were very realistic (maybe the reason for McDormand's Oscar) and reflects four different faces of human nature.  Within the gripping real-life tale, there are small sprinkings of humor (e.g., when the police asked the whore at the Inn to describe what Stomare looked like, all she could say is that ""he is a funny looking guy, who wasn't circumsized"") - ain't that how shallow and stupid our behavior is, at times!<br/><br/>I had two questions after seeing the movie.  First, not having been to the Midwest myself, is that really the Midwestern accent (now I believe it is, after seeing some of the comments here).  Second, why would McDormand's husband let her run after criminals on icy roads, knowing that she is pregnant.  Maybe, there is a serious lack of good police officers in this country, which is why crime is so rampant!

","I don't even know how to express, fully, my overwhelming love for this movie. It's the only movie that has instantly become my favourite movie after just one viewing. Others that have enjoyed a brief stay at the top of my list have only managed to do so after three or four studied viewings. But Fargo leaped right in at the number one slot just as soon as the credits finished rolling. This is a flawless film. The dialogue is outstanding, staying just the right side of quirky colloquialism with out sounding too cornball. The performances are perfect (How William H. Macy was beaten into second place by Cuba Gooding for the Best Supporting Actor Oscar is incomprehensible!!). The scenery and cinematography are a joy to behold. And the story is one of the most inventive I've come across. I can't recommend this movie highly enough. If you haven't already seen it, GO NOW!!

A person gets put through a wood chipper at the end of the movie.  I mean, what is the redeeming quality in that? I mean our whole purpose in life is to leave this world in a better place than it was when we were born.  This movie does nothing to promote that idea at all.  Sure, justice was done, but did it have to come at the expense of so mant innocent people, like the guy at the parking lot.  Why was he blown away?  Just for entertainment? I do not find innocent people getting wasted as entertainment.  I feel the same way about this movie as I do about ""Silence of the Lambs""  great acting but the movie dealt with a completely repulsive subject and a completely repulsive main character.  I still cannot figure out why that movie won so many Oscars.  I am not a right-wing puritan by any stretch of the imagination. But, I cannot recommend either of these movies to anyone.  If you want to watch a Joel/Ethan Coen movie watch Raising Arizona.  It is so funny.  And if you want to watch a Jonathan Demme movie watch Stop Making Sense.

","One of my favorite films.  I have seen Fargo many times, and enjoy each viewing more than the last.  The downfall of the flawed Jerry Lundegaard could be the subject of a modern Shakespearean tragedy, albeit one steeped in black humor and outright quirkiness. William H. Macy's character is one of the most intriguing in recent cinema, and he plays the role perfectly. He is fascinating to watch. Frances McDormand, in an Oscar-winning performance, serves as a moral center in a film laden with copious violence and duplicitous, inept characters. Just pay attention to the film's end and you'll see what I mean. I refrain from mentioning too many details, lest I rob the film of its magic, but Fargo is a superbly unique film, a brilliant, dark, and oddly charming piece of work. See it ASAP!"

","""Fargo,"" by the gifted producer/director/writer team of Joel and Ethan Coen, reminds me of one of their previous films which I enjoyed very much, ""Blood Simple.""  Like ""Blood Simple,"" ""Fargo"" is a tale of crime gone wrong.  This time it's a kidnapping plan that spins horribly out of control, leading to several grisly murders.  Also, like ""Blood Simple,"" ""Fargo"" is a comedy. But this time, for me, the humor didn't work.  ""Fargo"" has been described as something of a warmhearted tribute by the Coen brothers to the wonderful people of their home state, Minnesota.  No it's not.  It's a nefarious assault on decent people whose main offense against humanity, apparently, is that they are friendly and trusting.  And they talk funny.  I happened to see this film in Washington, D.C., where others in the audience repeatedly guffawed in superior tones at what were supposed to be silly rubes on screen.  Several audience members seemed to consider it their personal duty to laugh loudly and pointedly in sophisticated derision at decent, open and honest Minnesotans.  And the way they talk.  Maybe having grown up in the southern United States makes me particularly sensitive to accent bigotry.  I dunno.

I'm sure that many who have posted negative comments are simply overwhelmed by their own ""political incorrectness"" during the movie.<br/><br/>There are several moments in this movie when it is totally inappropriate to let out a good laugh, but also unavoidable. (When Mrs. Lundegard jumps out of the car blindfolded and tries to escape from her kidnappers through the snow, for example. Its a moment of obvious pure terror for her, but her callous and brutal kidnappers break down laughing and I'm afraid we do too.)

Some of them really do have to jump start their ""prowlers"" at 4:00 AM in 15 below zero weather.<br/><br/>There are actually small town police chiefs just like Marge all over America. And let's not forget that as ""goofy"" as she may look and talk, when she gets on the case, she is onto the bad guys almost from the start and pursues them with the single minded tenacity of a laser guided missile. I'm sure that there are real cops across America for whom ""Marge Gunderson,"" represented a very realistic portrayal.<br/><br/>No, I'm sorry some of you didn't like this movie, but for me it was a surprisingly deep, dark and astute piece of work for an American film. And I place Brainard Chief of Police Marge Gunderson right up there with Sam Spade, Columbo and Hercule Poirot among my all time favorite detectives and I would simply love to see her in action again.<br/><br/>If you still haven't seen it, you owe it to yourself to give this one a shot.

The other half falls into the ""Great Drama / Thriller"" category - these people enjoy ""Fargo"" only for the purpose of its drama and thriller qualities.

","SPOILERS!  This modern classic brought to us by the creative Coen brothers is great for the following reasons:<br/><br/>1.) The actors are brilliant, reveling in roles that are interesting to play.  Particularly notable are Macy as the feckless Jerry Lundergard, McDormand as the affable, partly pixilated, Chief of Police and of course Buchemi in his element in a role of delicious degeneracy.<br/><br/>2.) Dialogue. Or perhaps it is better just to call it quirky conversation, because that's what it is really. You just have to keep smiling at the accents and nonchalant banter, intertwined with telling character development and smart irony.  From the cavalier `Ja' interview between McDormand and the two young women who showed the inept criminals a good time, to the priceless parking lot attendant/authority discourse we are treated to a stream of palaver that is amusing and at the same time insightful.  We are so entertained that we don't even find it strange that Buchemi's character uses phrases like force majeure.<br/><br/>3.) The bizarre circumstances that intersperse the story that are resolved through violence.  From the slapstick-like kidnapping scene to the fortuitous highway massacre to the disgusting wood chipper finale, the violence that underlies the generally flat exterior of the characters, is seemingly incongruous. It is however, a reminder that even though the people in this world are somewhat stolid, tumult and depravity pervades beneath the persona.  This is driven home in McDormand's expostulation to the surviving criminal near the end.<br/><br/>4.) Jerry Lundergard.  There are numerous nuances to the film but the most interesting surround Macy.  A cashier gives him an egregious simper in a diner, his inept dealings with his oppressive father-in-law lend him our sympathy and his reply to his son, `Just ask Stan Grossman, he'll tell ya!' makes us cringe.  Two scenes with him are very piquant and tell us much about him: the true-coat scam, and the part where he enters his father-in-laws office to discuss a business deal and there is nowhere for him to sit.  Simply brilliant!<br/><br/>A great movie."

","This is a violent movie; still I am inclined to call it a minor masterpiece. Many viewers disdain violence in movies without making any effort to distinguish the ways in which violence may figure in a story. Deplore, if you like, those movies which seek to portray violence for its own sake, or for titillation, or for money; but know that ""Fargo"" is not one of these. Rather it has the feel of a Medieval morality play (with a Medieval style musical score, if you needed a hint), wherein the evil-doers suffer the consequences of their actions, and those consequences occur on more levels than meet the eye.<br/><br/>Also, know that the criminals are presented in a very unflattering light, are seen for what they are--creepy Neanderthals. The big blond guy, Grimsrud, is sub-human. At the end, the endearing and good-hearted woman sheriff makes a statement to him (and to us) about how his evil actions, even had they succeeded, had gained him nothing of lasting value. In her soliloquy she compares blood money with the value of the joy of an innocent heart (""and it's a beautiful day""), but he doesn't even know what she is talking about. She is speaking to an empty shell--immoral behavior has left him with a soul so shrunken and shriveled that he can't comprehend or appreciate beauty on any level.<br/><br/>Oh, this is a little gem of a movie! Its touches of macabre humor--the not-quite-growls of the fearsome father-in-law, the sullen son's musical idol, the unedifying conversation of the killers, the bouncing pony tail on the enthusiastic young prostitute, the TV drama watched by the Neanderthal--provide just the right contrast to the violence. The cinematography and acting are uniformly wonderful. It is indeed a pity that this one lost out to the incredibly inane ""English Patient"" for the Oscar; it would be unbelievable if we didn't know Hollywood so well.<br/><br/>
If you deplore wicked behavior, but enjoy wicked satire, see this movie. (But if you are an adolescent male, don't bother--this one's not for you.)<br/><br/>Rating: 9/10"

Their movies are stunning and ahead of their time.<br/><br/>Fargo, on the other hand, is not. In fact, the script lies down so flat it's hard to believe that someone actually made this movie... it simply didn't need to be made. I have to give credit for poking fun at the north midwest - I was born in North Dakota and moved to Rochester, Minnesota and then St. Paul before heading East - but that just doesn't make this a good movie.<br/><br/>The premise (guy hires thugs to kidnap his wife and he gets the ransom) isn't original. The criminal hi-jinks (kidnappers shoot everybody and anybody in their way) certainly aren't original. And please, Frances McDormand's character might just be the biggest cliche in the entire movie. Good cop gets the bad guys in the end. There wasn't even any suspense, nothing went wrong... most of the entire movie was predictable. And even though McDormand delivers a fine, fine performance, she's only in the movie for fifty minutes or so!<br/><br/>The Coens' unmistakable touches on the film are what save it for me. The humor, the accents, the situational irony are superb. But they can't save the plot, which is just too ordinary.<br/><br/>Overall a 6.5 or 7 out of ten, for fine cinematography, a very good score, the realistic accents, and the great ensemble acting.

And then when your hole just gets deeper and deeper, it's just so very tragic. Macy is terrific at playing these types of characters, (and if you haven't seen his 2000 movie, ""Panic"" shame on you) where he's in trouble and he can't seem to find his way out, no matter how hard he tries. Next up is Marge, played with amazing subtlety by Frances McDormand, who is just a great actress. While she doesn't seem to say ALL that much in the movie, I wouldn't call her character simple by any means. She is thinking. Should we force this cop to talk about everything she's discovering and realizing just because she's in a movie? That's ridiculous.

(Warning: This kindof reveals some stuff that I think is common knowledge, but all who haven't seen this great film may not know. Yeah, don't read this without seeing the movie) The scene with them at the restaurant takes place just after she talks to Jerry the first time, and nothing happens. She talks with the Asian man and finds out that all that stuff he had told her was a lie. So then she realizes that Hey! this could be the case with Jerry as well, so she goes back and interrogates him once more, and discovers she was right. There you go. It makes perfect sense. I love the way that the grisly aspects in Fargo are treated as not so much hilarious as they are peculiar and bizarre, such as the kidnapping. It's funny, but in a peculiar way. I think that is the best way to describe this movie. It is engaging, fascinating, to me just plain irresistable, and peculiar."

","In the beginning of the Coen brothers film Fargo a sign tells us that we are about to witness a true story. The sign fades to white and from within the white a car emerges. The car tows another brand new, light brown car on a country road covered in snow. The story, in its simplicity, is based on an authentic criminal case: A failed car dealer hires two villains to kidnap his wife in order to collect the ransom himself and thereby solving his economic troubles. But the kidnapping goes wrong and a series of innocent people get killed and soon the police is on his and his accomplices' tails. The man that tows the car is Jerry Lundegaard, the car salesman. He's on his way to meet the two villains, whom are the ones to kidnap his wife, in Fargo, North Dakota. The towed car is a down-payment of the kidnappning.<br/><br/>Carter Burwells musical score and the snow softly falling down contributes to amplify the fateful mood. The Coen brothers last film, The Hudsucker Proxy (called Strebern in Sweden) was a wonderful story with actors as Paul Newman, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Tim Robbins. The movie wasn't a success. At least not in the USA. Joel and Ethan Coen refers to the movie as ""Coen brothers big flop"" and doesn't deny that Fargo is a deliberate step into a new filmable manner, maybe to once get the home audiences approval. Fargo is a low budget movie without any stars and with a modest length of 93 minutes with which the Coen brothers finally have conquered the american audience.<br/><br/>Fargo is a kind of tragic comedy. Jerry Lundegaard is an average familyfather who once was every mothers dream that gets pushed around by his wife's father. The kidnapping is as much a way for him to solve his economical problems, as it is for him to speak his mind. When he decides to go along with his plan, it's probably the first in a long time that he takes an inititive. Gaer Grimsrud and Carl Showalter are the villains he hires. The one is the talkative, and you believe he will never end, and the other says less than 15 lines in the entire movie!<br/><br/>Together they make an odd couple that only argue when they talk to each other. They are extremely clumsy and it's sometimes hard to believe the ferocious and violent acts that are carried out by them. The people in Fargo aren't evil even though they do evil actions. They're not comedians but they end up in comic situations. The kidnappning is brutal but the events just before, during and after are extremely funny and it is hard not to laugh. Likewise when the hand over by the ransom money end up in a shooting; and instead of blood it's feathers that pour out. Marge Gundersen, the pregnant police officer that with her thick winter clothing looks like a penguin, is the antipole of Jerry Lundegaard. But Marge isn't a person that you laugh at. In difference to Jerry she knows exactly what she is doing and has no problem in dealing with the situations she encounters. Marge is more charming than comic and is no regular movie hero. It takes 40 minutes before we encounter her for the first time. It's the events before, that introduces her.<br/><br/>Fargo is a black comedy, maybe even a tragedy. The Swedish actor Peter Stormare makes a great performance as the strong silent smoking villain, Gaer Grimsrud. My advise is to see the movie."

","This review contains potential spoilers, but nothing major.<br/><br/>The one-line summary above was hard to write; the brothers Coen, always as a team, consistently deliver solid and usually masterful films with their beautiful visual style and amazingly realistic dialogue. Barton Fink and Miller's Crossing are very closely behind this as their best production. However, Fargo's mix of quiet, intellectual comedy and hard-hitting crime thriller is really amazing. The film can be compared to their debut, the 80's thriller ""Blood Simple"", only with a slightly lighter tone and less disturbing environment; both involve a husband/wife heist gone wrong, only in Fargo it comes together perfectly.<br/><br/>The acting leaves nothing to be desired. Put simply, they are up there with the best of the 90's; Steve Buscemi is awesome as the constantly-cursing smart guy behind the scheme; William H. Macy, a loser in just about every role he plays, delivers here in his best performance; and Frances McDormand is absolutely incredible as the pregnant cop on the trail of the kidnappers.<br/><br/>Fargo has many classic scenes. In one of the most intense sequences ever filmed, Buscemi's character drags a dead cop off the highway as an onlooker drives by to witness the action. Afterwards, he is hunted down by the other kidnapper and shot to death in the dead cold snow. To see two innocent people killed by a hardened criminal is not only chilling, it's downright disturbing. Many other great scenes precede and follow this one. To list them all would be futile; every scene is perfection. Fargo is a masterpiece and MUST be seen by any serious film buff, and most definitely by any Coen Brothers fan. ""A+"""

","Such frustration! Fargo being probably one of my favorite movies of all time, I just had to comment on a few misconceptions, misguided comments, etc.<br/><br/>1. This is NOT a true story. That text at the beginning of the film was a joke, part of the brilliant, subtle comedy of this film. So, no these people do not really exist. I mean REALLY!  If this hilarious bungled crime actually happened, don't you think we would have heard about it?<br/><br/>
2. Slow?  This movie is not slow at all. It just isn't quick-cut, tons-of-action-a-minute like the vapid films that make $100 million at the box office in one week. And, at any rate, ever BEEN to Minnesota? Life is slow out there. Perhaps the pacing of the film was mimicking the way of life in the midwest?<br/><br/>3. The whole Mike Yanagita thing. Why couldn't the purpose of this whole side-story just simply be to add texture to the film, another layer to Marge's character? Unlike some people who took SUCH issue with it, I didn't mind it at all, and laughed my head off at the sight of an Asian man speaking with a hilarious MN accent. People might think that's ""Non-PC"" who cares. It's called COMEDY.<br/><br/>4. Oh, the accents. I dont want to hear it. I work with people from Minnesota, and YES they do talk like that.<br/><br/>5. Frances, the Acting Goddess, giving a FLAT performance? It's called S-U-B-T-L-E-T-Y. Please look it up. I know Hollywood doesnt much like subtlety, but once in a while it sneaks in there and the film is better for it.<br/><br/>6. Cant this be BOTH dramatic/tragic and comic at the same time? There is no rule that says a film has to fit neatly into one genre! This film IS tragic, it IS dramatic, and it IS very funny. So whats the problem?<br/><br/>Oh, yes... And I am one of the many who feel that The English Patient was an overblown, overrated, big, boring epic that did not deserve the Oscar over this little gem of a film that's destined to be a classic."

","To me, the success of a film is largely depending on to what extent it kept me glued to the screen. Whenever I decide to watch 'just a couple of minutes' while gobbling down a late night snack, and end up watching the whole movie because it is able to grab me by the neck and never lets go, someone has done something right. <br/><br/>So Fargo was a very strange experience. It begins very well, with actors giving straight A  performances, doing a tremendous job in establishing their characters. Their mannerisms, looks, and voices make these well-written characters three dimensional and fun to watch. <br/><br/>The story premise is promising. Loser of the year Macey needs money and his father-in-law is loaded, but because he want to keep his 'dignity', he just decides to hire a duo of loonies to kidnap his wife and split the ransom, to be coughed up by daddy.<br/><br/>Needless to say, ""Things Go Wrong"", to quote a minor Chris Isaak song. Blood is shed and, eventually, the bodies just keep piling up.<br/><br/>Investigating all this, is a pregnant and merry sheriff, who loves her Bob Ross-wannabe hubby and just can't figure out why, on such a lovely day, people would want to kill one another over some money.<br/><br/>But, keeping Chris Isaak in mind, it never became the wonderful movie I expected it to be.<br/><br/>It's a rather meandering movie, and between the many moments of brilliance, there's also a lot of boring stuff, many moments that enables one to visit the john or get another beer without missing anything interesting or crucial. Mind you, I'm not talking about 'slow scenes'. 'Slow' and 'boring' are, as we all know, two completely different things. Sometimes it's necessary to walk slowly to admire the view, to catch the details or to be soaked up by the atmosphere (""Lost Highway""; ""Barry Lyndon""). That's good. But when you find yourself in a small room with no windows and start to walk slowly around in circles (""Eyes Wide Shut""), that's when restlessness and boredom start to kick in. This film contains a lot of stuff that could and should have been cut out. For example, the subplot involving the Mike Yanagita character. According to the charming and talented actress Frances McDormand, who did an interview on Dutch television, this scenes were included to show that even her loveable character Marge has her dark side, as she doesn't know how to behave during the date with this old school buddy of hers. Ms. McDormand ended her explanation with the rhetorical question ""[Joel en Ethan Coen] are great writers, aren't they?""<br/><br/>Well, a truly great writer would have been able to make that point about Marge within the main story itself, instead of having to resort to an additional storyline that sticks out like a sore thumb and momentarily halts the movie.<br/><br/>So watching this movie is weird for me. I own it on video and whenever I put it on to watch 'just a couple of minutes', my fingers keep starting to move to the stop button. Every time I'm about to push it, something brilliant happens on the screen and I let go of the remote, only to find my fingers going towards it again a couple of minutes later.<br/><br/>*** out of ****"

","It's hard to find something new to say about this film after so many comments have already been posted here.  I'll own up to being one of the crowd who claim that it's close to flawless.<br/><br/>So what I'd like to highlight is this:  Frances McDormand's portrayal of the police chief Marge Gunderson strikes me as being one of the best depictions of a wholly good person that I've seen on screen.  It would have been so easy for the script to have given her a raft of inner demons to overcome or a corrupt PD to fight or mounds of frustrating paperwork to do.  All old stuff - seen it dozens of times.  But no - Marge lives a comfortable but not wealthy life, she has a husband whom she loves and who loves her and she possesses the kind of natural trust in people which allows her to be deceived by an old school friend because, heck, why would he lie to her? But Marge is trusting, not gullible; she lives a simple life, but she's not simple; she's gentle with people, but she's not a doormat.<br/><br/>It's just so refreshing to find a character who demonstrates that good doesn't equal stupid and that nice guys don't have to finish last."

I thought Frances McDormand was decent,<br/><br/>William H. Macy increasingly nervous, but I felt the real excitement was brought to the screen by Steve Buscemi. A staple of Coen Bros. films, he brought such explosiveness to the screen. He should have been nominated for a Supporting Actor Oscar, b/c he does just that...he supports a film that i felt would have otherwise fallen flat on its face. As i said, though, Fargo did have some great parts, like all of their films do. The hotel room fight between Shep and Carl(Buscemi's character) left me laughing and in awe.

","At the beginning this film reminded me on Sam Raimi´s ""A Simple Plan"" which I had seen before and which is also worthy to watch, but very soon ""Fargo"" develops its very own style. The story is about a quite harmless conspiracy that ends in a total disaster. All happens in a small dump called ""Fargo"", that is snowy and idyllic, where you couldn´t expect anything evil. But the Coen Brothers take a look behind the facade, a view into the depths of the human soul. It all starts with a kidnapping action that finally leads to five senseless murders. It´s a film about cheating, betraying and killing. At last you´ve got the unpleasent feeling that something could be wrong with your own neighbour...  This movie is a brilliant mixture between thriller, drama and satire. There are some macabre/funny scenes in it (when Gear ""disposes"" his companion Carl) and a lot of peculiar characters, what is usual for the outputs of Joel and Ethan (watch also ""The Big Lebowski"" and you know what I mean...). Of course, ""Fargo"" is casted with the obligatory Coen-staff, that contains Joel´s wife Frances McDormand, Peter Stormare and Steve Buscemi who´s stealing the other ones show. Perhaps some people might find this movie dull: ""Fargo"" is no film with big talk and 10000 dead per minute... You have to pay attention on the subtle humour and the little subtleties in it.

","This darkly comic tale from the Coen brothers is arguably their finest piece of work to date. They apply their trademark quirky style to the not entirely original plot of a car salesman who arranges his own wife's kidnapping in order to get the ransom money from his scrooge-like father-in-law. However, the simplicity of the plot allows you to concentrate on the most important part of the film, the carefully crafted characters, each with their own idoesyncrasies that make it a delight to see which strange creation will appear in the next scene.<br/><br/>These are perfectly realised by a fantastic cast of actors. While credit must go to the ever-dependable Steve Buscemi as the bungling kidnapper and William H. Macy as the salesman full of frustration and impotent rage, the best performance is by Frances McDormand, who deservedly won an Oscar as the heavily pregnant sheriff trying to solve the crime. The only main female character in the film, she is surrounded by a succession of increasingly more pathetic men, from her househusband, to an old school friend who still lives with his parents. Even the crime itself lurches from one disaster to another as events conspire to make a seemingly straightforward kidnapping escalate into a multiple homicide. The unfamiliar location of Dakota provides some great backdrops and spectacularly barren vistas and the snow somehow adds to the absurdity of the whole situation. Also adding to the comedy element are the unusual local accents which are seemlessly adopted by the cast and if you don't find yourself mimicking a Minnesotan for a few days after seeing 'Fargo' then you really ought to visit a doctor to see about getting that funny bone removed, it's obviously not working right."

Otherwise there should have been a postscript at the end of the film as others do. I was initially intrigued that it was based on true life, thinking that one couldn't conceive such disaster.

","I've just finished viewing Fargo in a Media class, and I think that it's one of the best that I've ever seen. The performances of the two who play the kidnappers is truely something to be marveled at. On one hand, you have the silent, dark , brooding type, then you get to the other, a loud extrovert who gets so frightened when the first murder of the officer happens, it's just so contradicatry. The whole of the film is centered about the comical thriller aspect of the narration, mainly being omniscient when the scene cuts back to Jerry and Wade, but being balanced between restrictive and omniscient when the kidnappers are featured. If the film has any bad points, I for one, certainly can't see them. Ok, so I may like this sort of film, but it's because it's a change from the usual. It's funny, and scary at the same time, much like Psycho after the 2nd viewing and seeing all the in-jokes. In summary, I think that this film is the best that I've ever seen, I hope that you'll like it as much as me..."

","Fargo is a film unlike most films I have seen in my lifetime.  Its level of detail and realism makes the film stand out.  The criminals in this movie do an excellent job playing their parts.  They are the kind of criminal you see in a variety of movies, the ones who blunder because of their own stupidity, but unlike a lot of other movies I have seen, the actors in Fargo make their ignorance seem so real.  Steve Buscemi (Carl Showalter) and Peter Stormare (Gaear Grimsrud) do an excellent job of making their roles believable ones. Sometimes I just wanted to burst out laughing but refrained from doing so because of the content of the scenes.  At the end of this film you'll be asking yourself, `Was this really based on a true story?'  This film is referred to as a black comedy, meaning that what makes the film funny is the way the gruesome scenes are handled in the film.  Overall I'd really recommend this film, unless you have a strong distaste for violence.  There is never a slow scene in the entire film; you'll have your eyes glued to the screen the entire time wondering what is going to happen next.  The ending is very ironic, and it's something you'll pick up on immediately when you see it.  A very well done and must see movie!"

Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy)is the classic novice criminal.  He is almost to dumb to dislike.  Carl Showalter(Steve Buschemi)is the classic career criminal who can't figure out that he is not very good at his chosen profession. Marge Gunderson ( Frances Mcormand) is the classic small town police chief, she seems to be very nieve but you can tell that just like Columbo she always gets her man!

The film wasn't too long or short it was just perfect. All the scenarios were significant because one lead to the next.  It was amazing at what length the producer went to gather all the significant characters to make this movie like Frances McDormand who played Marge Gunderson, the pregnant policewoman with a strong personality.  At first when she appeared, I laughed and thought what could she do, she can barely walk.  Yet at the end I was impressed at her courage when she approached Peter Stormare, who played Gaear Grimsrud the cool quiet kidnapper, and without hesitation shot him in the leg to arrest him. There were some scenes that were too gruesome to watch, like when the trooper was shot in the head and you could see the blood gushing out of his head.  Also the scene when Peter Stormare was pushing Steve Buscemi's body, who played Carl Showalter the other funny looking kidnapper, through the wood chipper.

"darkjosh","9","0","0","5 November 2000"," Brilliant, Seemingly-Simplistic Film
","Fargo is a wonderfully unusual, extremely well scripted crime film that crackles with strongly developed, yet very off-beat characters, sporadic violence, splashes of dark comedy, and an outstanding ensemble supporting cast.<br/><br/>When Jerry Lundergaard (the marvelous William Macy) schemes to have his wife kidnapped by criminals Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare so that he can collect the ransom money from his wealthy father-in-law, everything is planned and set to go smoothly.  But this, being a Coen brothers film, nothing goes as planned and eventually everything goes downhill.  That's when Officer Marge Gunderson (the quirky Frances McDormand) begins her investigation of the ""malfesance.""<br/><br/>Fargo's greatest attribute is the dead-on, masterful performances of its cast, and not one of them misses their mark.  The standout, however, is William Macy, as the none-too-bright husband whose scheme goes terribly awry.  Macy perfectly embodies the inept Lundergaard and portrays his frustration wonderfully with such lines as ""the heckdy'a mean?""  Even after his plans take a turn for the absolute worst, we sympathize with his plight. His scene with his son is such a squirm-inducing one, that for a minute we find him both despicable and we sympathize.  Frances McDormand also shines in her Oscar-winning role as Marge Gunderson, the pregnant, determined, quirky, and optimistic detective assigned to unravel this mystery. Buscemi and Stormare are also dead on as the kidnappers : Stormare's dry, mute performance complements the loud, abrasive performance by Buscemi.<br/><br/>The scenery is also appropriately bleak and desolate, with the whiteness and dreariness of snow pervading all, from it's opening shot of a single car materializing out of the white of snowfall.  It's interesting to see how the Coens have contrasted the bleakness of the area with the colorfulness of it's inhabitants: all seem to be perky, polite, and ever-so-nice.<br/><br/>The script is also well-written, with some very original, inventive scenes, such as Macy's car sale to an irate customer, an abrupt car chase in the stinging coldness of Brainerd, and a very colorful conversation with a local regarding some suspicious ""lookin fellas.""  The dialogue is also quite funny at points, and effectively terse at others.<br/><br/>Fargo is a film that is a crime film that is engaging without any of the normal elements found in the genre: it has no long, dangerous car chases, no grandiose shootouts, and of course, it has no cliched, stale villains or heroes.  It's power lies in its uniqueness, both in its complex story and its down-to-earth, credible, engaging characters, and of course the concrete, dazzling performances turned it by the entire cast.  Fargo is a winner, and is it destined to be a classic? In the words of McDormand, ""Oh, ya.""<br/><br/>9 out of 10"

","Fargo is an excellent film, not least because of the characters portrayed within it.

For those of us already Fans of the brothers work or who went in with an open mind, this film was wonderful - from the afore-mentioned characterisations to the bleak landscapes to the town (and accent..) itself.

","The first half of this film plays like a comedy. It's very funny in a dark kind of way, especially the deadpan comments of the two crooks and the perfect timing of the direction. Then, all of sudden...BAM...the smalltwon sheriff is graphically shot in the head. You then find yourself saying, ""Wait a minute...that wasn't very funny."" The movie just gets more interesting at that point, especially when we are introduced to our hero...a pregnant police chief named Marge. Huh? It's neat how this film shows us a thriller played out by simple smalltown folk. William H. Macy does an excellent job portraying a man who is frustrated and can't seem to get a break. And even though he's about to have his own wife kidnapped and scam the hired thugs out of millions of dollars in ransom money, his humbleness and frustration causes us to relate with him, and we feel sorry for him (until the end, at least). The film reminds us all of a time in which we had a good thing planned out and going good for ourselves, only to watch someone else ruin it for us. And on a final note: The accents in the film, although funny, are greatly exaggerated. Many people who live in the region are embarrassed and offended by it. But guess what? Movies have been doing the same thing to people from the South for a long, long time (Watch any movie that has a Yankee actor using a ridiculous ""southern accent""). I think it's time for the Midwest to stop complaining, Fargo is one of the best films of the nineties."

","Reading comments of other viewers corrobates the fact that Fargo will become a cult classic. Some view it as a cinematic masterpiece; others view it as the complete opposite.  Still others view it as a leg-pull. Regardless, the story, acting and reality base of the characters cannot be ignored.  It is a black comedy, a genre which generally doesn't lend itself to gut-wrenching guffaws, yet it is also a thriller.  It may take a couple of viewings to truly appreciate the brillance of the Coen brothers and of the cast. Locally, Fargo's release and popularity caused another Coen project, ""Blood Simple,"" to be re-released in theatres around town.  Watch them both -both are excellent, but Fargo, coming 13 years after Blood Simple, will show that the Coen Brothers have refined their craft, not re-invented it."

While I hate to use a cliche, the movie puts you through quite a ride - one minute you are flinching at a particularly violent scene, the next minute you are chuckling at some banter between two characters.<br/><br/>The acting itself is superb; all of the actors who have major parts in the film (Macy, McDormand, Buscemi, Presnell, Stormare) manage to portray their characters in such a way to complement the storyline as it moves forward. None of them ""steal the show"", so to speak - every actor in the movie put forth a good effort and they all manage to work well within the context of the story. On top of all that, the fact that the film looks beautiful is a testament to the camerawork; it's hard to make endless amounts of white snow look good, yet Fargo does it, time and time again.<br/><br/>Everytime I watch Fargo, I am consistently amazed at how well done the film is. The entire movie is perfect entertainment, and the ending, while incredibly violent and dark, is superb; it's a great payoff as well as providing closure to the story.<br/><br/>It's almost impossible to believe that this movie did not win the 1996 Academy Award for Best Picture.

","The Coen brothers, Ethan and Joel, have created in Fargo their best film to date (and I'm writing this after The Big Lebowski). I've watched it I think four times and each time am again impressed with its outrageous excellence. If you love inventive camera work, intelligent scoring (Carter Burwell), sharp dialog, and a strong female lead (Frances McDormand, winning the Oscar)--and are not put off by occasional violence--then Fargo is well worth seeing (in fact, worth buying!). Just one thing: Take the ""true story"" tag with a grain of salt. Apparently the Coens were having some fun with that declaration!"

","After a four year wait, I finally picked Fargo off the shelf and rented a film that seemed, from many film critic's opinions, and from the Oscars distributed that year by the Film Academy, worth watching.  And I wasn't disappointed.  This is by no means an action-packed, fast-paced, roller-coaster ride of a crime thriller.  But, as the opening credits point out, this is a true story, and the Coen Brothers have respectfully and bravely left the story to tell itself, the way it really happened.  And it is this that makes it work.   <br/><br/>The fascination of being told a true story held my attention through the beginning, and through the building of the quirky characters, and by this time the film had become fascinating in itself.  Through the chaotic life of an unhappy, desperate family man lured into staging his own wife's kidnapping to pay off debts, we get a charming insight into the simple but happy lives of the police officers of Brainerd, Minnesota and the chance to feed off the humour created by their unfazed, nonchalant attitude towards life and all that it throws at us, as they amble patiently along the murderous trail of crimes and stumble across the criminals at the climax. <br/><br/>
This film, for me, didn't need action and excitement.  The saying that 'fact is stranger than fiction' held true in this instance.  This was resounding evidence of the merit in telling a fascinating story exactly as it happened without the traditional Hollywood dramatisation.  <br/><br/>Quietly satisfying."
"manucan","Null","0","0","18 February 2000"," Great story-telling!
","I watched it again on tape and enjoyed it as well as in the cinema.  While it never stirs the spirit or moves the emotions that an epic or even a great actioneer can, it so well-done with a minimum of 'movie-magic' that I was left, oddly, with the satisfaction that a parent feels on seeing a perfect score in the kid's gradebook.<br/><br/>There are superficial parallels with that great Coen film Raising Arizona (which Frances McDormand also appeared in) in that a kidnapping is the premise for the story-telling, and that Frances McDormand's small fiesty redhead cop character immediately reminded me of Holly Hunter's (who, of course, used to be the Coens' room-mate).  Their partners in both shows are also big gentle slow-witted types, as are the amateurish bad-guy duos. The bleak settings of the Arizona desert and the Dakota winterscape also provide a similar sense of background scale which, hence, enhance the focus on the human element.<br/><br/>Fargo is far less self-indulgent in the fantastic humour of Arizona, yet retains the same smart cynicism.  It has an eerily realistic European feel, with the natural acting and absence of MTV-style audio-visual enhancements. It generally ""tells it as it is"", from all the 'nature-of-life' little errors and screwups in most scenes, to the understated closing of the story. It champions honesty, integrity and the simple life, and how a little greed can disrupt the cycle of the good ol' American way of life.<br/><br/>Another great movie which Fargo reminds me of is Gorky Park (1983 with Hurt, Marvin and Dennehy), set in wintertime USSR and released back in the days of the Evil Empire, albeit with a different slant, but with a similarly peaceful bleakness in the feel, backdrop and moral-of-story."

"Pasafist","10","0","0","18 June 2003"," Passafist Reviews Fargo
","The Following is the 2nd in a series titled Passafist: The Great Films<br/><br/>The crime in the Coen Brother's film FARGO has to have been the worst executed crime in the history of cinema.  It's flawed from the very beginning.  It's a good thing that the movie isn't the same way; it's possibly one of the best-executed films of the last 25 years.<br/><br/>
I've always been a sucker for strong character dramas.  Plot is inconsequential to me for the most part. I always look at it as that added bonus if a plot really grabs me.  I just realize that most stories operate on the same seven or eight premises.  So it is the characters that save them.  FARGO is full of great characters.<br/><br/>The film opens in Fargo, North Dakota, at a shady trucker bar.  Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macey, Panic) is there to meet Carl (Steve Buscemi, Con Air) --a low rent, funny looking crook.  Carl is there with another man named Gaear Grimsrud (Peter Stormare, The Big Lebowski), a tall, silent and scary looking crook.  Jerry drops off a car and sets a crime into motion. The two crooks are to kidnap Jerry's wife (Kristen Rudrud, Pleasantville) and hold her for ransom.  Jerry is trying to embezzle money from his well-to-do father in law Wade (Harve Presnell, Face/Off), who is a real jackass. <br/><br/>Needless to say, what should be a simple crime goes terribly wrong.  When three people show up dead in a small town called Brainerd, the local sheriff, Marge Gunderson (Francis McDormand, The Man Who Wasn't There) get on the case.<br/><br/>What Joel and Ethan Coen have crafted here is a drama of such life and scope.  It's not simply about a crime.  It's about people living their lives at a moment in time.  There are scenes in this film that are unnecessary to the plot that are completely necessary for these characters.<br/><br/>Take for instance, the intimate scene in a hotel resturant in Fargo.  Marge is met by an old high school chum, named Mike Yanagita, (Steve Park, and TOYS).  He invites her to the hotel to seduce her.  He's so bad at it that he makes up stories to try to win her over.  She's so sympathetic, to this mans needs, but also wary of his advances.  Any other film, this scene would probably be cut, it sure doesn't move the story along.  But it paints a clearer picture of just who Marge really is; it's vital to the evolution of her character.  It's perfect.<br/><br/>There is another brilliant sequence near the beginning of the film where Jerry has just told Wade about a great land deal he has in the works.  He's hoping Wade will give him the money.  When the meeting takes a decidedly different turn there is a single shot of Jerry walking back to his car. It's so sad. It's so heartbreaking.  You sympathize with and for Jerry. It's reminds me of that scene in TAXI DRIVER, where Travis hangs up the phone after being rejected by Betsey and the camera pans away to the empty hallway, very effective both times. <br/><br/>Francis McDormand is perfect as Marge.  She embodies even the pregnant suit she wears through the entire film.  I don't know why Marge has to be pregnant; the film would work without her being that way.  But that again is one of those small character beats that makes FARGO a film worth watching.<br/><br/>Another interesting device the Coen Bros. use is a small title screen at the beginning stating that the film is in fact a true story.  In all honesty it isn't.  But what that allows the film to do is work in the realm of the real.  Sure the film is a work of fiction, but still there is a feeling of authenticity that little title allows. Honestly the first time I saw FARGO, I thought it was a true story, and I believed it throughout the entirety of the film.  <br/><br/>Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare make great crooks.  In any bad film these two characters would be bumbling idiots.  Neither one is terribly smart, but there is certain finesse to there performances.  I particularly liked the early scene where Buscemi's character Carl tries to stop talking to show Stomare's Grimsrud he can play the silent game. Of course Carl can't shut up, so he winds up talking to himself.<br/><br/>After reading this review your probably thinking this is a drama.  But the AFI listed it as one of the 100 greatest comedies.  How does that add up? Well, life is sometimes really funny; sometimes you hear a joke and you can't help laughing.  FARGO is a comedy of situation.  Marge for instance is a naturally funny person, so she'll tell a joke.  She's sweet and good hearted and so are the people she works with. So naturally funny things will happen.    <br/><br/>FARGO is a great movie.  Well worth 95 minutes of anyone's life.  It's a slice of life comedy, set against a gritty and horrible crime.   It's a human character study.  FARGO is one of the best movies ever made.  I love FARGO.<br/><br/>
GO SEE FARGO!!!"
"JMann","10","0","0","2 September 1999"," a great example of realism
","I first saw Fargo in a grand, opulent, and beatifully restored 1920s movie theatre, now used for ""special screening"" films and the more accessible arthouse flicks.  Seeing Fargo was my first time in this theatre, and I return on a semi-regular basis.  I am glad to have had such a wonderful introduction, both to the theatre and to the film.  In both respects, Fargo is classic cinema: worthy of being seen in the palatial grandeur of the best movie houses, and the kind of movie that is well-remembered when discovering such wonderful old places.  Like the best output of the Coen Brothers, this is a remarkable character study relying on dark humor and cold realism (no pun intended) in creating a complicated and troubled scene of human emotions, troubles, and motives.  Its greatest success is in attributing each of its characters with a complexity of characteristics: each one can be liked in his or her own way, and each is presented with such realistic vision that the viewer is suspended in his predicaments.  The ability to capture the viewer is one attribute of a film that makes it great, and Fargo brilliantly displays that ability in the most subtle and quietly profound ways."

","First of all, the title, ""Fargo"" is insignificant, that's just the name of the town where the story begins.<br/><br/>And it's rated R for two short sex scenes and there's also a whole lotta swearing!<br/><br/>I rented this thinking it'd be some intense thriller with comedy in it, anyway I guess I was expecting something else because the first time I saw it I didn't think it was all that great.  But then I saw it again and Zingo!!!  I love it!  I even bought the soundtrack.<br/><br/>It shows how going against the law and doing bad things just doesn't work. The movie says that greed will get you to awful places.  Here's this guy, Jerry, who looks like he's doing okay, only he just wants more money.  So he hires two crooks, who are don't mind breaking laws for money, to do something that puts his wife at a big risk!  Weird old Jerry loves his money more than his wife.  Sure, his wife's father, he's real well off.  But he's a jerk, and is stubborn with his money.  Then everything goes horribly wrong and people start dying and/or going to jail.<br/><br/>And then there's the Gundersons, Marge and Norm.  Real simple people who aren't rich and are expecting a child and they both work (Norm has a cooshy job at the post office and also enjoys painting, and Marge is a policewoman).  Norm is a great husband, bringing Marge lunch or making her breakfast.<br/><br/>By the end of the film you realize that these two folks are happy.  And they're the only main characters that come across that way (There's some benign extras, too).  All the crooks and jerks aren't happy, they're either mad or panicky or breaking laws and doing bad things and beating each other.<br/><br/>Even Marge's old friend from high school isn't happy.  Now I've heard some critics say that this guy, played by Steve Park from tv's ""in living color"", is just a part of an annoying pointless subplot.  But this is actually just character development for Marge.  She cares about him and his troubles, and is real sorry to hear about how things are for him, but when she finds out he was lying to get pity, she's real surprized.  ""I just don't understand it""<br/><br/>""I just don't understand it"" is one of the most powerful lines I've heard because how could nice ol' Margie understand all these crooked shenanegans when she knows the truth about things and about getting happiness. Happiness isn't a little money, it's finding someone you love and maybe having a family and not having to run away from the law all the time.<br/><br/>I noticed that some of the parts with the ""nice people"" were kinda boring. Maybe that's to show that these people may be boring, but at least they're not going to get shot or caught by cops or have guilty consciences or anything, so that's fine.<br/><br/>Needless to say, it's one of my favorites, and if for any reason you don't like R rated movies, just watch the TNT version--that one's just fine."

","The premise of this screenplay begins with a lie to the audience; at the beginning of the film, a somber title comes on saying that ""due to respect for the survivors, names have been changed in this film"". This implies that the events of the film are true, and that the writers are showing respect. <br/><br/>Neither of these two things are true. The Cohen Brothers, after winning the Oscar for Best Writers (not before), eventually came out and admitted the story was entirely fictional. So much praise had been heaped on them, that no-one seemed to care at that point. <br/><br/>It would be great of newspapers worked the same way. Bush would never have been criticized when no WMD's were found. <br/><br/>Why does this matter, and who cares at this point? <br/><br/>When I first saw this movie, I was disturbed by the way the kidnap victim, the mother, was portrayed: as comic relief. Her running from her kidnappers was comical, the way she was shown running around in the snow with a bag over her head was comical, and even her death (her skewed legs upside down) was shown as comical. <br/><br/>The son, however, who was terrified for his mother, was not shown comically. So here we have a screenplay where the writers showed a terrified victim as comedy, and the son's terror for his mother dismissed. If this screenplay had been based on true events, to say this was disrespectful both to the mother and the son is an understatement. Imagine being the son who survived your mother's kidnapping and murder, and seeing her portrayed in this way.<br/><br/>But that's OK, because we find out later the whole thing was fictional. Except for the fact that I wasn't the only one upset by the way the victims were presented; other people, in particular victims rights groups, were too. Then we find out that we had been jerked around, that it was all a fiction.<br/><br/>Does that make it any more acceptable? Imagine your favorite movie that moved you because it was based on true events; then you find out years later it was all done so you would buy a ticket, and you had been deceived. This is what the Cohen Brothers did to their audience. <br/><br/>Good writers? Sure. Ethical people?

It receiving awards is just to top it off, actually, but doesn't change much of anything: Hollywood is obviously an industry and not an art school, so it makes sense that they celebrate garbage when it's what they are producing most of the time anyway, and it would be real odd if it weren't that way. Of course I'm generalizing here, but I think that anyone in their right mind will understand what I'm saying. Saying Hollywood, by the way, means referring to the directors, actors and so on (a lot of them celebrated as models, go figure) that are responsible for contributing to it one way or another - I'm really sorry for them and I'm not kidding you, as they are in a lot of risk of passing it to their children. Like I say in the title, things like this movie are more telling of the state of popular U.S./worldwide culture than a book-length sociological study - it's either what popular (mass) culture has become (if you want to put it that way) or what it has been led to become (if you prefer it like that). I leave the details of why this movie is worthless to other people that have posted it already and said it better than I could (Check them out).<br/><br/>Another thing, though unrelated. When posting this I find a warning from the site, the ""don't write a spoiler"" thing, which states that, if you do, your *future* reviews will be automatically discarded. Dare I ask who would want to write a review when knowing that it will be automatically discarded? Looks like the people from this site, just like the ones that made the movie, are that type of *smart*. What do YOU think?"
"hnt_dnl","2","3","9","5 March 2011"," Quirkiness for quirkiness' sake
","I used to have a high opinion of critically acclaimed Oscar- nominated movies...key words USED TO!...A long time ago in a movie-watching galaxy far, far away. Of course this back when I was too young to know any better. Much as I despise most acclaimed films that come out now and think that better ones came out when I was growing up, I can still pick out overrated tripe from the ""good old days"" and FARGO (1996) is definitely overrated tripe! FARGO is actually a film that I like to reference when a movie like THE DARK KNIGHT (another overrated piece of trash) comes out because FARGO is one of the first examples of a film where I realized that EVERYONE that praised it so highly back in the day could NOT for the life of them truly justify WHY it was so great! With THE DARK KNIGHT, at the very least fans of that flick can point to the one good thing about it and that is Heath Ledger's performance (but nothing else).<br/><br/>Pretty much every review I recall hearing about FARGO used sweeping generalizations to describe it and simply seem to use the excuse that just because of the fact that it was novel for the lead character in a big (directed by Coen Bros.) crime drama film was (A) female and (B) pregnant, and (C) a cop, that automatically makes it groundbreaking and a modern masterpiece.<br/><br/>But the simple fact is...there is nothing to Frances McDormand's character, nor William H. Macy's, for that matter. How in the heck McDormand won the Oscar for making barf jokes, sounding stupid, and literally doing nothing for her short screen time (Macy had more than her, seemed like the real central character, and somehow he got tagged for a SUPPORTING nom to her LEADING nom and win) is beyond me. Macy is a tad better, but in the end came across just as emotionless and empty. And the Midwestern accents? EVERY character sounded the same! Every character is treated and acted like a caricature of real people (based on a true story), but none of them (well, save perhaps one in the end) left any kind of impression with me. The Coen's 3 previous big films BLOOD SIMPLE, RAISING ARIZONA, and MILLER'S CROSSING (their true best film) all had their character quirks and strangeness, but the characters in those films all had real personality, depth, and at the end of all 3 of those films, I actually drew something important from them.<br/><br/>The ONE authentic scene in FARGO is actually the opening one when Macy meets with prospective kidnappers Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare to map out the plan to kidnap his wife so he could use the ransom money to solve his financial problems, but from there on, it's all downhill! Then after that, it's just a bunch of quirky, go-nowhere, slow- moving vignettes, some of which have nothing to do with the story, and even the ones that supposedly do are dominated by the annoyances of the characters (overdone) Midwestern accents and just making boring idle conversation, with the actual plot points coming across as distractions...Yeah, we get it, Coens...solving crimes in real life is boring...you proved it!"

I honestly don't get what all the hype is about.<br/><br/>Coming back to the topic, this movie very much like Coen Brother's other ""masterpieces""** Burn After Reading & No Country For Old Men, is pointless, boring and extremely overrated. It is an average movie with a week story line, irritating acting with an annoying & excessive use of the word ""Yah"".<br/><br/>** I would like to make an appeal to other reviewers to stop calling every other movie a ""masterpiece"".<br/><br/>If you are about to watch this movie i would seriously suggest that you do yourself a big favor & for a change not go with what the majority views say & watch something else.

","I put off seeing this one because my dad went to Fargo High and I knew it would be weird to see this movie. Then i decided it was time--gee, what a good rep the movie has had to this day. However, my early doubts were sound. Hokey accents and ""character bits""---beginning with the waggy headed blonde cashier. So, that dates this movie. Cuz now we know that the Upper Midwest is populated with regular people, who are not painfully cute in their snowsuits. In fact, audiences moved to penguins, who don't even have to wear snowsuits. As time has gone by we have also grasped the range of William (Pleasantville) Macy. He's gone on to better things. But the caricatures and gruesome psychosis juxtaposed with inept human greed and self-centered myopia---ah! it is a diversion. And it is very agreeable to watch Frances McDormand work. The Coens seem to have gone in, done their job and pulled out. A directorial road movie in which the repetitive snowy road goes through mood changes--same road, but the story has altered its meaning. At the end, it's comfortingly familiar. I feel the skeleton of a better movie here. Like Peter Jackson's animated bugs in ""King Kong"", the smiling heads of quickly daubed ""local color"" wouldn't be missed. There's good stuff, and it's just off the road a bit, that beautiful straight, snowy road."

","I eventually got around to seeing this film after years of meaning to. It's very well made, well produced, acted and directed, I just didn't really like it very much.<br/><br/>Firstly, there's not really any main characters in the film that I felt any liking or sympathy for. OK the female cop, but she wasn't that much of a character, or, at least, not one we really learnt that much about.<br/><br/>Secondly, it was always very obvious what was going to happen, right down to the ending. Such was the general incompetence of the perpetrators, there could hardly be any other outcome.<br/><br/>So, all in all, not a film that really engaged me or one in which I cared about what happened to the characters."

","Obviously this movie struck a chord with many people, but I failed to see its charm. I found it visually beautiful, but hollow. I found the characters hollow, both the good and the evil ones.<br/><br/>If I had interpreted it differently though, it could be perceived as a projection of the characters onto a purely material plane, in which they are observed strictly in terms of their actions with no added effort to reveal their psychological state on the part of the filmmaker. The onus is on the viewer.<br/><br/>In the end, in any case, I was not drawn in, and I found it to be a cold meditation on the effects of human stupidity and materialism. A description of a world that we don't quite actually live in, but could, if we don't watch our step and observe ourselves in the same cold ridiculing manner of Fargo's camera?"
"emeriboy","5","2","5","5 August 2006"," Okay -- It had the Potential to be Better
","After watching Fargo, I was left with the same feeling I felt before I watched it; a need to be entertained. Don't take that the wrong way, the movie entertained me, but those entertaining parts were few and far between. Between what? Well, nothing (Nothing as in bland snow-cast lands) And I'll say the movie was awfully long feeling for only being one and a half hours or so.<br/><br/>The humor of this comedy if mostly created by those over-exaggerated (I hope) accents. And when everybody else is laughing at that and I felt left out. Lucky for you, you're probably in that 'everybody' category.Other parts were entertaining though, a number seemingly useless actions, shots of funny things we all do once in a while and of course, the all superior chit-chat type of humor. Basically the type of humor Steve Buscemi is known for; the kind I like.<br/><br/>But between these glory blessed scenes of humor are a few nice-to-watch action sequences and frankly, quite unentertaining conversations. But where the movie fails the most -- where it could've been made better, is the overall atmosphere. It isn't edgy like 8 Mile or laid-back like Pulp Fiction, it's more along the lines of . . . nothing. Not only that the scenery consists of homey feeling houses and as I said before, snow. Officially, I'm not retiring to Fargo, North Dakota after watching this movie. It seems much too cold and depressing.<br/><br/>And while some of the scenes could have been polished up, sped up, or even cut out, the acting is fairly funny and a few characters are good, while others are bland and bad. Steve Buscemi's Carl is of course my favorite character, and the conflicting pair between him and Grimshrud creates a few good jokes. Shep Proudfoot adds a little spice and Marge the expecting cop is nicely done as well. But the rest of the characters just seem to annoy me, especially Jerry Lundegaard. He appeared very self-centered (as he was meant to), and there was nothing to like about him. But somehow he did'nt seems villainous enough to be the bad guy, leaving him looking like neutral/bland character.<br/><br/>So in the end, it just seems that Fargo has something bad to bring done each good things it has going for it, thus earning it a nice average 5 out of 10. While my friends seemed enjoy it, I nearly killed myself watching it the second time through. So for me, it is more or less not worth a rent."
"colonel_green","5","2","5","4 March 2005"," A disappointingly ordinary film.
","""Fargo"" is frequently called the best film ever made by the Coen Brothers, but I must resolutely veto this notion. How people can consider this superior to ""Miller's Crossing"" or ""The Hudsucker Proxy"" I'll never understand. The film tells the story of Jerry (William H. Macy, playing his standard pathetic loser), who arranges to have his own wife kidnapped by two goons (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare, as their standard characters, a foul-mouthed weasel and a taciturn thug), in order to get the money needed to pay off his debts. Things go wrong, and police officer Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) is on the case. The film won two Oscars in 1997, Best Screenplay and Best Actress (McDormand); I must say that it didn't deserve either of them. In particular, I found McDormand's performance incredibly overrated. Margie is a cartoon character, and nothing more. I give this film a disappointing 5/10."

The problem lies in the script, which just isn't very good.  I found nothing at all unique about ""Fargo.""  It's just extremely mediocre.  I give it a five out of ten."

I laughed at William H.

","The Coen brothers always come up with hits (for instance, Raising Arizona) but this time, they bring us to the deep north (North Dakota that is) to showcase a very well made movie with suspenseful scenes, interesting acting and many other things, ya know.<br/><br/>The film plot involves a car salesman who is very insecure (played very well by Macy) and who wants to snuff his wife out.  So, he hires a duo to kidnap her (the duo is probably the best of the year by Steve Buscemi as a wisecracking killer, and Peter Stormare as a un-talkative killer) and eventually kill her.  But what he doens't know is that a pregnant police officer (played in an Oscar winning role by Frances McDormand) is on the case to find out what's going on.<br/><br/>This is just the tip of the woodchipper in this creative, ingenious, and wonderful (though odd) murder mystery in Fargo, ND.

","Fargo Directed by Joel Coen<br/><br/>""The atom bombs are piling up in the factories, the police are prowling through the cities, the lies are streaming from the loudspeakers, but the earth is still going round the sun.""George Orwell <br/><br/>According to the opening title of Fargo, the events that follow are all true, but out of respect for the dead, the names have been changed. However, according to the last title, none of this should be perceived as true. Is this a Coen brother's commentary on what has the final say, if there is one? No, it's more of a cynical mocking of crime capers who make the initial claim based on a loophole like the last. Much of Fargo goes similarly. It executes hideous acts of violence and crime and then tries to distance itself from them by using a heavy handed police detective Marge (Frances McDormand).<br/><br/>It's also a comment on crime genre clichés. It picks apart the idea of how in novels, crimes go perfectly. The crime here is a kidnapping of Jerry's wife which is delegated by Jerry (William H. Macy) so he can collect the ransom from his wealthy father in law. The crime is executed by Gaear (Peter Stormare) and Carl (Steve Buscemi) who will receive half the ransom and are merely looking for ""some money."" <br/><br/>Part of the problem with Marge and the three other lead characters is their simplicity. Jerry is an upper class evil while Gaear and Carl are a lower class evil, while Marge is pure good. The characters in Blood Simple and Miller's Crossing on the other hand were all various forms of each, and one can sympathize with most if not all of the major characters. This film also exhibits none of the excellent precision of Blood Simple, a film some view as a prequel to this one. But Blood Simple's violence was used as a means for a point and not an end.<br/><br/>One of the other major functions of FargoLike Alexander Payne's Nebraska trilogyis to get back at the land from where the Coen's hail from, Minnesota. They make fun of the accents and rural attitudes through thinly veiled contempt. It generalizes about Minnesotans weaknesses for prostitutes and fast food, while essentially putting the joke on us for watching this violence unfold.<br/><br/>The chaos that ensues after the kidnapping has no control system set up by the filmmakers, but is messy and ugly and only gets messier and uglier as the film goes on. But even with all this going on, the film never surprises. Its style is the only thing that keeps us interested, but the style fades in time and all we are left with is one very cynical and simplistic world view.<br/><br/>Actually more like a 4/10, but wanted to get the comment noticed."

Jerry Lundegaard(Played by William Macy) is a poverty stricken car salesman who devised a plan to have his wife Jean Lundegaard, (played by Kristin Rudrüd)kidnapped and held for a million dollar ransom to make a quick buck from his father in law(played by Harvey Presnell). All according to plan until the ""funny looking"" thugs hired by Jerry (played by Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) out of sheer incompetence, murder a police officer who pulls them over and two ordinary people passing through who where at the wrong place, at the wrong time. The best part of this film has to be how the movie intrigues with each turn of events in the story that only increase the tension between the viewers and the main character jerry, as his whole plan comes crashing down on him especially when he learns that his ransom will have to be raised to 80,000 to compensate for the unnecessary deaths. Not only that but he also has to worry about the intrusive police officer Marge, (played by Frances McDormand) investigating the triple homicide.

"sharky_55","10","1","2","28 June 2017"," And here ya are, and it's a beautiful day.
","In Fargo, the Coen brothers demonstrate their sheer mastery and control of black comedic tone, laying siege to a small, unsuspecting Minnesotan town with a grand criminal conspiracy. At least, that is how the opening captions announce it, white text on black, alerting the audience to its degree of seriousness and authenticity. This little white lie riffs on the same types of preludes often seen in true crime stories or serials such as Dragnet, always beginning with the ominous brass theme and a warning: ""The story you are about to hear is true. Only the names have been changed to protect the innocent."" And listen to how Carter Burwell's score serenades the opening shot of a car slowly appearing in deep fog, a Norwegian folk tune beginning with a few bells and whistles but then soaring to a crescendo of operatic ridiculousness. If Fargo takes place in chilly, rural North Dakota, mostly forgotten by America, its male characters certainly don't believe it. They think (or desire) themselves as self-made men, figures that can withstand the harsh winter and forge a path ahead. Much like that Paul Bunyan fella. <br/><br/>We are firstly introduced to Jerry Lundegaard, played by William H. Macy in a career-defining performance of such spinelessness that every time he is cornered by a shred of decency, he finds some way to weasel out of it. The genius of the Coens is to continually place him in situations that guide him to do the right thing, only to watch as Jerry splutters and fumbles an excuse for his wrongs. The opening pits his virtues against two hardened criminals (or that is the front they put up) who end up questioning his motives: why would a man want to kidnap his own wife, and why does he not simply ask his father-in-law for the money? Further scenes ramp up the dramatic irony as we witness his mastermind scheme fall to pieces; he sweats on the spot when Wade threatens to wrest control of his double-crossing, fretting not for his wife but for the handsome profit slipping through his fingers. The cruel irony is that his one moment of capability is stolen from him; on paper the numbers are solid, the plan looks fool-proof, but even this he cannot take full credit for. ""It's my deal here!"" he squeaks as a million dollars floats away, and with it the last vestiges of his father-in-law's approval. <br/><br/>This vein of quiet desperation and foolish masculinity continues in Carl, who repeatedly finds himself at odds with the small-town milieu. Like Jerry, he is obsessed with material gain beyond decency, a sore thumb sticking out from the rural tapestry of kitsch: relentless good cheer, comically exaggerated accents, an almost alien sense of satisfaction with their modest lives. His encounters are marked by cultural clashes aggravated by his incessant greed - his fury at having to surrender four dollars to an ever-smiling parking attendant, later revisited with a bloody twist, and the eye-popping incredulity he wears and elicits when he erupts at Grimsrud for suggesting they split the Sierra, never mind the million dollars he has already stashed away for himself. This hyper-virile brand of foolishness sees the men stumble in the ice and snow, discarded by their out-dated fantasies of power and control. Visually, the film presents winter as a gloomy mood in itself; there is seldom a hard shadow in Deakins' photography, but the residents are all smiles. Jerry, on the other hand, hacks with futility at his ice-covered windshield, and shrinks considerably when challenged on his Trucoat scam. Watch Carl literally interrupted mid-orgasm and handily beaten; he acts as if he owns the place, but he can't even get the waiter's attention. <br/><br/>The strong sense of place is crucial to Fargo's subversion of these fantasies and overarching genre expectations. The men come from the city hoping to cash in on Jerry's big score, but are physically rejected by the locale. It is through the sheer naivety and optimism of Fargo and Brainerd's residents that the Coens funnel their comedy, so blind to the evil intentions of the criminals that they simply carry on without a care. Jean knits and hums absentmindedly while watching daytime television, achieving a peace of mind that her husband could never be content with, and when a masked man with a crowbar taps at her back door, her first reaction is a curious tilt of the head. Various other interviewed witnesses convey the same mild bewilderment that a crime of such caliber could ever arrive at their doorstep - the affair is treated with the same amount of concern as the weather, or the score of last night's hockey game, interspersed with a few 'Yah' and 'Oh yah's along the way. <br/><br/>Fargo's slippery case of shifting protagonists sees it ditch Jerry for Marge, the film's cheery antithesis to the desperation and egotism of its men. Notice the precision of Frances McDormand's incredulity and disappointment she levels at Jerry, who thinks he can flee from his crimes, and at Gaear, who without a second thought stuffs his partner into a woodchipper. She scolds him like a child, ""There's more to life than money, ya know?"", and praises her husband's three cent stamp as if it was worth a million dollars. Could her character survive in today's films? Look at her counterpart in the Fargo television series. Carrie Coon's Gloria is at odds with modern technology and its overarching structures - automatic doors won't respond to her, and justice hides in a bureaucratic maze. She represents a righteousness that seems rarer and rarer each day, a morality no longer worth its weight, buffeted at every turn by larger forces out of her control. But Fargo sees her worth. Fargo believes that decent people get their turn, and that it's okay if the result is only a three cent stamp and cheap buffets. If only we had less Jerry Lundegaards, and more Marge Gundersons."

","The first time viewers were introduced to the strange crime and comedy of Fargo, North Dakota comes from the Coen brothers' brilliant drama. The ""true"" story begins in 1987 with Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) hiring two criminals, Carl Showalter (Steve Buscemi) and Gaear Grimsrud (Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wife. Jerry is trying to get his father Wade Gustafson (Harve Presnell) who has a lot of money to pay for a car lot. When Wade agrees to help Jerry out, Jerry tries to stop the wheels from turning on this crime. The two criminals are shown to be very odd, debating over pancakes and having women in the bed right next to each other. This quirkiness is not only a funny aspect of many Coen brothers films but continues in the television show.<br/><br/>The criminals break in and kidnap Jerry's wife just as Jerry learns that Wade and his business partners will only give him a finder's fee for his new lot. Carl and Gaear are pulled over by an honest cop who refuses to take a bribe and hears the woman's crying so Gaear shoots him in the head. While Carl disposes of the cop's body, Gaear hunts down pedestrians who see the crime and try to escape. Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) gets the call to investigate the murders. Since she's pregnant, she almost barfed at the crime scene. As Marge investigates the scene, Jerry works to cover up his crime and keep the police out of it.<br/><br/>Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com"

","This movie was nominated for several Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Actor in a Supporting Role (William H. Macy). It won Oscars for Best Actress in a Leading Role (Frances McDormand) and Best Writing (the Coen Brothers).<br/><br/>Fargo is certainly one of the Coen's finest and most famous movies. It claims to faithfully relate a true story that occurred between Fargo, North Dakota and Minnesota's Twin Cities in the late 1960s. The real story is anything but funny. But, this movie has its share of both humor and of black humor. <br/><br/>The movie begins in Fargo as Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) is making contact with two ""professional"" thugs to arrange for his own wife's kidnapping. Jerry, a car dealer from Minneapolis, with big personal money problems, wants his wife kidnapped because he knows his father-in-law is very wealthy and will pay the ransom for his own daughter. <br/><br/>The idea is that once his father-in-law pays off the thugs and his wife is released, and he can split the ransom with the thugs. HOWEVER, once the deal is made and Jerry gives them one of the cars off of the lot, things start to go downhill when the quitter of the two thugs kills a policeman for stopping them to ask why the car has no tags. The killing of the policeman leads to two other passersby being killed. <br/><br/>After this triple homicide, Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand), a pregnant cop is called into the case. As the movie develops—and the kidnapping scheme unravels—we are entertained by both the stories and characterizations of Marge's friends and family as well as Jerry Lundegaard's constantly frustrating and deteriorating predicament(s)."

","""Fargo"" is a good movie, I confess that my experience with the movie was impaired because I watched the great series ""Fargo"" first, which contains a similar plot, but much better detailed and developed, because it is a series, so I watching the film compared to the series, and missed the further development of the characters, then the script to me, was not suppressed, on the contrary, I even I was disappointed a little (save dialogs), the soundtrack is good, photography the film is great, the acting is good, mainly from Frances McDormand, the way the situation is getting worse more is comical, his black mood is very good, violence is sarcastic, the great dialogues, the Coen brothers are masters in this type of humor, and use a lot of visual to help build all the comic climate / tragic film.

"jake-law123","9","1","2","1 December 2015"," My favorite Coen film of all time.
","This my favorite, and the best Coen film of all time. Even though it's a fairly simplistic story, it has comedic elements of all sorts. Frances McDormand as a pregnant Minnesota cop investigates homicides that are connected to a family man hiring hit-man to kidnap his wife to collect the ransom money from his rich father-in-law.<br/><br/>The story is told fairly straightforward, with extremely funny jabs at Minnesota culture, particularly on their accents. The funniest is the jabs at Steve Buschemi being described as nothing but funny looking, really goes to show how the Coens feel. William H. Macy as the husband of the kidnapped woman is a nervous mess in every scene he's in, going out of his way to cover up anything that goes wrong. Steve Buschemi is an absolute riot every time he's on screen, being a bumbling screw up in almost everything he does.<br/><br/>This is the best Coen film because it is not only a comedy, but it's a comedy of different varieties. If you tried to explain why these scenes are funny, you couldn't because they're that clever. Very recommended!"
"JaydoDre","8","1","2","26 December 2014"," Warm & Cold
","Fargo is a good movie with a specific style but it will undoubtedly leave a few viewers disappointed. <br/><br/>There are principally 3 faults with the movie, all 3 of which are story related:<br/><br/>1. Fargo opens with the following text: "" THIS IS A TRUE STORY. The events depicted in this film took place in Minnesota in 1987. At the request of the survivors, the names have been changed. Out of respect for the dead, the rest has been told exactly as it occurred.""<br/><br/>This is a lie. Definitely in the way this sentence comes over, this is a lie. It becomes evident as you watch the events unfold that they are not a realistic retelling of any specific crime story. The text comes right at the beginning and, as such, sticks in your memory. The directors knowingly put this into the movie and it feels insulting.<br/><br/>2. Unresolved plot lines. The main plot is that a guy is conducting several different kinds of illicit activities because he desperately and urgently needs a lot of money. It is never explained why. Sorry, but letting the viewer out of the most important question in the story is both cruel and unprofessional. There is also another more minor point that never gets resolved though the resolution is hinted at.<br/><br/>3. The general lack of impact. Despite some fairly violent events occurring, this movie feels very low key and rather slow. It is part of its style and seems to have purpose, but you must be aware that this movie takes its time and for some that time may not amount to that much in the end, especially considering points 1 and 2. When the film ended, it felt more like I just saw an episode of a show rather than an entire movie.<br/><br/>Despite these flaws, the story is interesting. It was fun to see the continuously worsening situation of the criminals and the calm and appealing investigation by the protagonist.<br/><br/>The movie has a particular style in both the visual presentation and story. The events take place in the winter in the north of the US and the outside is a world of desaturated cold white. It is starkly contrasted by the warm cozy lives of the common people inside the warm houses, with the warm food and the warm friendly feelings. This is also contrasted with the cold dealings of the criminals and their world of misery.<br/><br/>At first it feels at first like the world of those criminals is full of intrigue while the life of the main protagonist Marge is mundane and small, but as the movie progresses, the proceedings of the criminals become full of misery and very petty in comparison with the apparently small lives of others. Fargo feels at times warm and cuddly, other times cold and disturbing.<br/><br/>Fargo has a unique soundtrack. It is built on a slow tune of strings, a lot of it in medium to lower register, with slow and deep base drum beats in the background and some high pitch percussion. It has a folksy and meditative feel to it. When some sort of action happens, the music either goes quiet or continues with a grave tension but never becomes fast. It sounds quite different from your average movie soundtrack.<br/><br/>The performances are great, all of them. William H. Macy plays the desperate car salesman and this guy makes his character looks so skittish, with his nervous smile and the shaking head and the stuttering. He does a near flawless job. Frances McDormand, as the protagonist policewoman received the many nominations for her performance. She has previously played a mom and the role of a homely family woman suits her well and she does indeed deliver a very pleasant humorous performance. Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare are the criminals, as is often the case and they are fun too. Peter is a guy who is just naturally extremely unnerving. In this movie he does not talk much or move his facial features. His lifeless expression and composure are just naturally terrifying and the scary impression he gives gets completely justified when he suddenly does something really violent.<br/><br/>There is a small complaint about the dialogue. While it is generally entertaining , there seems to be a strange mockery going on as the characters keep saying ""ya"" a lot, which is ""yeah"" spoken in the northern accent. I cannot figure out if this is supposed to be joke or just poking fun at the Northerners, but it does get annoying after a while.<br/><br/>Fargo feels different than your average film. It is a bit slow but it is a sweet coherent and interesting movie. This movie makes you feel warm inside, despite its violent content."
"SnoopyStyle","9","1","2","18 May 2014"," Coen brothers' black comedy masterpiece
","The Coen brothers flash the based on true story disclaimer for a real 1987 Minnesota incident. It's one of the misdirections. Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) hires two bumbling criminals Carl Showalter (Steve Buscemi) and Gaear Grimsrud (Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wife and force his hard father-in-law Wade Gustafson to pay the ransom. Jerry is miserable working for Wade in his car dealership and he's in desperate need for cash. The kidnapping goes horribly wrong when more people get killed including a police officer. Pregnant sheriff Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) goes to investigate.<br/><br/>This is a great movie. It has its funny moments. It has great visual touches, the quirky characters, and the off-kilter style that is the hallmark of the Coen brothers. Macy is incredible as the sniffling little weasel. It walks the absurd line between dark and comedy. It has plenty of both. It is simply wonderful."
"eric262003","9","1","2","15 April 2013"," A Great Film By The Brothers Coen
",".The Coen Brothers truly outdid themselves with ""Fargo"". Sure they've scored big with other projects like ""Raising Arizona"", ""Barton Fink"" and Blood Simple"", but ""Fargo"" is and always will be the film that really stood the test of time as one of the more successful films that the Coen Brothers ever produced. Next to ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Fargo"" is one of the best modern day noir film with the Coen formula of tragedy mixed with high prolific humour and violence that will make anyone's blood curdle.<br/><br/>""Fargo"" is one of those obscure movies that has no real negative sayings about it. Based on actual events that occurred in Noth Dakota/Minnesota in 1987, the movie tells the tale about a financially unstable car dealer named Jerry Lundergaard (William H. Macy) as he cooks up a plot to have his wife Jen (Kristin Rudrud) kidnapped. So he hires two thugs (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormere) who are kind of short on brains and seem to mess things up all the time. This leads to the local Sheriff Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) to seek justice on this whole predicament.<br/><br/>What makes this film really special compared to other Coen Brothers films is that the script provides a very diabolical dark humour and the dialogue is near perfect thank mainly to the leading performers William H. Macy and the very funny but effective Frances McDormand. The Coens who were from Minneapolis deliberately made the actors utilize these distinct accents and lingo to get the effect of living in the Minnesota, North Dakota area. It may look and sound over the top and maybe annoying at times to some, but believe me that is how the spoke. It is in no way shape or form a cliché.<br/><br/>The camera angles truly exhibits artistic integrity like the Coens intend in all their movies and no scene or camera angle is wasted. They even succeed in making more mundane scenes equally engaging to watch. And sure the comedy here is the blackest of all black comedies, there are some lighter elements to it. sort of like what they did in ""Blood Simple"" and this was proved very effective.<br/><br/>The only thing I have to say is go see the movie and bring a buddy or two or more and have a great time watching it. Don't let the generic title fool as not many scenes are set in Fargo, North Dakota. But just by watching the movie I guarantee too you may want to bring a thermos with a hot beverage because this movie will in more ways than one chill you to the bone."

"lagudafuad","7","1","2","1 September 2012"," If anything can go wrong, it will...
","Fargo is a movie that depicts the Murphy's Law in total ""If anything can go wrong, it will..."" Well in this movie it all went wrong.<br/><br/>The movie states this is a true story, but that can be argued since the movie itself is completely fictional. The Coen brothers claim that many of the events that took place in the movie were actually based on true events from other cases that they threw together to make one story.<br/><br/>The movie's radical turn of events is something that will catch the interest of any audience, as things just don't go as they should for anybody. The film earned seven Academy Award nominations, winning two for Best Original Screenplay for the Coens and Best Actress in a Leading Role for McDormand. It also won the BAFTA Award and the Award for Best Director for Joel Coen at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival. The movie plots have Frances McDormand starring as Marge Gunderson, a pregnant police chief with a sharp and smart mind, who begins piecing together a case where a pair of motorists are found slain not far from the corpse of a state trooper.<br/><br/>As Marge continues to put it all together, more people seem to be involved in the case than there should.<br/><br/>On the other side of the events we have Jerry (William H. Macy) who has had his wife kidnapped so he can get the ransom money but everything just goes wrong.<br/><br/>Kudos to the Coen brothers for a nice screenplay as everything that seems to happen on each shot complements the next, the characters are well depicted and the acting is a strong A+. The movie did have its faults, there were scenes that were totally unnecessary and a lot of people may complement the accents but I found it meaningless.<br/><br/>Editing was top notch, directing to me was not so bad but won't award it. The story too had its lapse it took too long to pick up.<br/><br/>Coen brothers are no stranger to the Academy awards, their 2000 movie O Brother, Where Art Thou? Was also nominated (no wins), their 2007 movie No Country for Old Men won 4 Academy awards and their 2010 movie True Grit had 10 nominations (no wins).<br/><br/>Fargo is a drama, if you are not a huge fan of dramas this could bore you, but if you don't mind, you will find it interesting to watch.<br/><br/>www.lagsreviews.com"

","I just watched this for the 1st time, and it was surprisingly good. I actually enjoyed it. I know it's supposed to be a thriller/drama, because it had some brutal scenes, but I couldn't help but laugh at a few scenes because of their accents and overuse of the line 'oh yeah' There were some pretty random scenes, but that's what makes it a good movie. I loved Frances McDormand's performance as Marge Olmstead. She was my favorite character. Peter Stormare as Gaear Grimsrud was very creepy. Jerry travels to Fargo, North Dakota and hires two criminals to kidnap his wife, due to financial problems. When things go wrong, people turn up dead, and pregnant Chief Marge Olmstead is on the case. I would definitely recommend FARGO!!!"

"Gerionas","9","1","2","19 May 2011"," ""There's more to life than a little money.""
","A typical car shows up in a world of snow. That is how one of the best-written movies of the last 20 years opens. The movie that earned the first Oscar to Coen brothers and made F. McDormand into an international star. Besides, S. Buscemi and P. Stormare performances should not be forgotten either. Fargo is a story about pathetic man's pathetic plan to gain some money. It is set in Minnesota in the middle of the winter. Coen brothers are not afraid to play with genres so it is hard to tell if Fargo is a dark comedy, crime drama or something else. <br/><br/>The movie begins in a typical bar where from the dialog between pitiful Jerry Lundergaard (W. H. Macy) and two criminals (S. Buscemi and P. Stormare) we are given the context of the story. Jerry tells that he wants to get his wife kidnapped so that he could get some ransom money from his father-in-law (H. Presnell). The deal is set and the story sets off. As usual, in Coens movies, nothing goes according to the plan of characters and the story falls into absurdity. Firstly, kidnapping ends with a three cold-blooded murders and the start of murders investigation. This is there Marge Gunderson (F. McDormand) gets into a picture. She guesses everything right from the start and shines among other foolish characters (""I'm not sure I agree with you a hundred percent on your police work, there, Lou""). From this moment, the story splits into three parts – investigation by Marge, pathetic Jerry's attempts to fix everything and hilarious relations between criminals. These parts come to one only at the very end of the movie that is both funny and thoughtful at the same time. <br/><br/>One of the most significant things that made Fargo successful is the character of Jerry Lundergaard. Jerry probably is the most pathetic man in the whole movie. He is wrong in every possible way and it seems that he cares about nothing but himself (he even forgets how this kidnapping scheme will effect his son). Firstly, he works in his father-in-law's car dealership and is a lousy salesperson who sells cars by telling lies to customers and family life is no better – it seems that the true head of the family is his father-in-law. When he gets himself in some financial problems Jerry is so afraid of telling it to his father-in-law that he is prepared to steel money rather than ask for it. In addition, he even practices his speech before telling his father-in-law about the kidnapping. As the story goes further, criminals, Marge and father-in-law press Jerry more and more until he brakes down. However, there is one scene in the movie when we can see some humanity from Jerry. It is the scene there Carl Showalter (S. Buscemi) threatens to kill not only his wife but his son as well. Jerry impulsively tells to leave his son away from this and he seems to be very serious about it. <br/><br/>Another thing to mention is a hilarious screen couple of S. Buscemi and P. Stormare. They are total opposites of one another. Carl is an annoying ""talky"" type hothead who does nothing right while Gaear Grimsrud (Peter Stormare) is a cold-blooded professional who prefers to act rather than speak. Carl seems to irritate Gaear in every possible way from blabbering about the silence of Gaear (""Two can play at that game, smart guy"") to an inability to deal with unexpected difficulties (""I'll take care of this""). It is hard to imagine how these two characters became associates. <br/><br/>To sum up, Fargo is a well-written and well-acted story about very interesting and complex humans that makes you laugh and cry at the same time and in the end, we are left with a conclusion said by Marge – ""There's more to life than a little money."" These words perfectly sum up the entire movie themes and help to characterize characters by dividing them in to those who do and those who do not agree with Marge's words. <br/><br/>2011-05-19"
"cuppa_tetleys","6","1","2","25 April 2011"," Maybe I just didn't get it
","I will acknowledge that Fargo is, technically at least, a fantastic film. The Coen brothers always deliver fantastically written, directed and shot pieces of cinema, but I just didn't enjoy this one very much. I think it maybe to do with the setting - I know nothing about, nor care for Dakota or its significance. Also the characters - they were mostly appealing, but I just couldn't get in to any of them. There's some wonderful black humour on display here, some suspense, and good characterisation. However I just feel as if I've seen all of this done better elsewhere in individual instances, and I certainly wouldn't compare this to No Country For Old Men, which I watched recently. <br/><br/>If I want humour, I'll watch a comedy, if I want suspense I'll watch a thriller and if I want good writing I'll watch Oscar nominees. Though, to me, Fargo seems to be a diluted collaboration of elements that I've seen done better in their specific environment.<br/><br/>All in all, I suppose I'd compare my viewing experience to one of someone who is told the twist before they've seen the film - one of the major aspects of enjoyment is ruined from the beginning, and I just really didn't like the setting or characters."
"wilsr","10","1","2","13 April 2011"," Brilliantly conceived and (joke) executed.
","The storyline of this dark comedy drama has been gone over many times in other reviews so I won't labour on about it.<br/><br/>Suffice it to say that the overwhelming feeling of biting cold creeping into every part of the characters' bodies is brilliantly expressed. The multiple killings are leavened with a homely - Minnesotan - humour that somehow brings the whole movie together in a way that is typically Coen Bros.<br/><br/>The actors worked with dialect tutors to perfect the Minnesota accent to such effect that some of the dialogue is quite difficult to follow yet, strangely, this doesn't matter. The laconic way of talking interacts with the stark landscapes and reinforces the coldness which is so much an integral part of the movie.<br/><br/>The acting is almost consistently excellent: my one reservation is William H Macy's portrayal of the lead (anti)hero which to me just slightly off the mark in one or two scenes: I couldn't put my finger on why I felt that way and it isn't a real criticism of the movie as a whole.<br/><br/>Bottom line: first class, a movie to watch again and again (As I have!)"
"olie2008","10","1","2","29 December 2010"," Perhaps the most bizarre and absurd films you'll ever see. For me that's a guarantee you'll love it.
","Finally breaking through into 'mainstream' audiences, the Coen Brothers skillfully woven comedy, Fargo, tells the tale of a man's desperate attempt to bring himself out of the severe financial problems he has encountered. Jerry Lundergard, played by William H. Macy, decides that the best way to fix this problem his to have his wife abducted and his father in law to pay the ransom. However, as with all Coen Films, not all goes to plan. Directly from the beginning we are made aware that Jerry's decision to hire two criminals, characterised by their lack of agreement on anything, will result in dire consequences. As the film draws to it's end, we're left with the dead bodies of Jerry's wife, her Father, a Police Officer, two witnesses and one of the two would-be criminals. For me though, it's not the story, although written beautifully by both Coens, but the performances of Frances McDormand, William H. Macy and Steve Buscemi; all three of which have yet to have been bested. Fargo tells not only of the tale and ultimate downfall of greed, but also the fantastic quirky story of Marge Olmstead-Gunderson (Frances McDormand)in her quest to both catch the two criminals and her husbands stamp interest. Surely one of the best films of the nineties if not of all time."

Their Screenplay was complimented with an Academy-Award. Their direction, yes, this was a collaborate effort, comes flawless. Roger Deakins's Cinematography is superb.<br/><br/>In the acting department, McDormand is mind-blowing in a role that won her numerous award. She lives her character from start to end. William H. Macy is like never before. The actor is terrific, and nearly steals the show. Peter Stormare is fantastic. Steve Buscemi goes completely over-the-top, he doesn't impress in here. John Carroll Lynch is perfect.<br/><br/>On the whole, 'Fargo' is one of those films, where you feel proud to be a Cinema-Fan. It's one of the greatest films of it's time, or maybe, of all-times.

But his scheme goes disastrously wrong.<br/><br/>The film is an off-centre masterpiece with Frances McDormand in luminous form as a decent, heavily pregnant police chief whose slow, discursive style of speech disguises the sharpness of her brain. This may be the Coens' most satisfying film: a mixture of droll humour, gory murder, quick wit and bumbling stupidity. The snowy wastes make a striking visual counterpoint for the madcap action and jolting violence."

I don't know what won best picture in 1996, but I think Fargo deserved it.<br/><br/>The film is based on a true story, as it states in the beginning.

As with any Coen brothers movie it gets interesting as the drama comes in the most unexpected ways the plan goes not as planned as then a crazy game of chase and phone tag develops.<br/><br/>Enter the wild card and key element of the film as her character added such common ground and normalcy in a fantastic and blazing performance Frances McDormand is very memorable as the small town Minnesota deputy who investigates. As you really feel for her character she's so plain spoken like most in the film with her north mid western draw accent she's also pregnant yet she continues to fight hard on the investigation and come thru and break the case open like breaking ice on the cold Minnesota lakes.<br/><br/>Overall ""Fargo"" is a film that holds your interest the whole time as it's blended so well with suspense drama and dark humor that thrills it just makes you think just like so many other Coen brother films. And the performances and chemistry of the cast is super it just proves ordinary people can find themselves twisted up in crazy things only to all have back to normal in the end. Really a unique film that's memorable and very good."
"Gunn","10","1","2","17 April 2009"," Superbly done Masterpiece!
","Being a Minnesotan I love to watch films made here or about Minnesota; films like: ""Purple Rain"", ""Grumpy Old Men"", ""Grumpier Old Men"", ""Untamed Heart"", ""North Country"", ""Prairie Home Companion"", ""The Heartbreak Kid"" and others. ""Fargo"", however, is my favorite Minnesota film. It's a typical Coen Brothers film and by far their best! Yeah, they make fun of our politeness and our Scandinavian-German accents. As kids we are taught at home and in school, as well as on the job to always say Please and Thank You, hold open doors for others, wait your turn, don't speak loudly or yell and we rarely use the word Yes, for us it's Ya. Some people were embarrassed by this but most of us are proud of our politeness and our Nordic roots. It's known as ""Minnesota Nice."" So, as for ""Fargo"", most of us loved it. None of us talk like the Officer who says, ""I'm gonna have ta ask ya ta git outta da curr."" That said, most of the characters are spot on. Roger Deakins shows the bleakness of a prairie winter, but also its beauty. Carter Burwell's score has a tinge of Scandinavian folk to it. The Coens make fun of us but we don't mind because they've created a masterpiece in ""Fargo"". The cast is superb: Frances McDormand and John Carroll Lynch as Norm & Marge Gunderson are the heart of the film. Steve Buscemi as Carl Showalter, Peter Stormare as Gaear Grimsrud and William H. Macy as Jerry Lundegaard are a fine trio of bad guys. Kristin Rudrud as Jean Lundegaard, Harve Presnell as Wade Gustafson and Bruce Bohne as Marge's partner Lou are terrific. My favorite character of the cast has a small part but plays it brilliantly and is in my favorite scene. He is Bain Boehlke and he plays Mr. Mohra who is the guy shoveling his driveway and who is describing Carl Showalter as a ""funny looking guy"". I love that scene it really makes me laugh. In spite of its gore, the screenplay of ""Fargo"" is incredibly fascinating and very entertaining from beginning to end. Bravo Joel and Ethan!"
"gcd70","8","1","2","3 June 2008"," Coen Brothers Triumph Again
","The ingenious Coen brothers return triumphantly with this amazing tale of kidnapping gone horribly wrong. I say ingenious because the brothers Coen brought us that gangster masterpiece, ""Miller's Crossing"". And I say amazing simply due to the fact that the tale told in ""Fargo"" is based upon actual events that took place in Minnesota.<br/><br/>The brothers' odd way of looking at life is reflected in the screenplay from the pair and Joel's comic, slightly off-centre approach to what is essentially a horrifying story of a man's fatally destined plot to get together enough money to support a wild business venture. In the hands of the Coen brothers though it comes across almost like a satire, in which the audience will find themselves constantly laughing - when their mouths are not agape.<br/><br/>Editor Roderick Jaynes has done a fine job keeping the story punchy and pepped up, Roger Deakins' cinematography is eye catching and contains some snow scenes you may not quickly forget and Carter Burwell's distinct score adds real flavour to proceedings, though it's not as good as his sweeping, poetic music from ""Miller's Crossing"". It is the cast that are the real strength here however.<br/><br/>Frances McDormand gobbles up the lead role as Marge Gunderson, the local cop who seems to stumble on clue after clue to the disappearance of Jean Lundegaard (Kristin Rudrud) while always maintaining a most infectious demeanour. Even more impressive is William H. Macy as Jerry Lundegaard, the weak-kneed husband whose crazy plan backfires more than an old bus and whose silly smile and pathetic machinations dig him deeper and deeper into oblivion. Steve Buscemi is very enjoyable as the weaselly, ""funny lookin'"" Carl who goes form Mr. Smooth to Mr. Insane as the deal goes from bad to worse to completely nuts. Finally, as Gaear, the menacing, quiet partner, Peter Stormare has us quite convinced he is one guy you wouldn't want to cross. Also stars Harve Presnell and John Carroll Lynch.<br/><br/>Monday, February 17, 1997 - Hoyts Croydon<br/><br/>The genius of the brothers Coen shines again in this manipulative, surprising thriller/comedy/tragedy whose many shallow characters give it much depth.<br/><br/>Brilliant perfs from McDormand and support bring to life this quirky collection of people, many of whom totally lose the plot when it comes to kidnapping and large amounts of the green. Cinematography in America's white-washed North is fantastic as is Carter Burwell's apt score.<br/><br/>The Coen brothers may well be the screenplay kings of the 90's.<br/><br/>Sunday, November 23, 1997 - Video"

","Coen brothers are known to be one of the most original film making duo working in Hollywood.A lot of adjectives can be used to describe their films and the great thing is that no two films made by them are same. Fargo is a great film as it doesn't hover around neither Hollywood type conventional narrative structure nor sometimes hard to fathom independent cinema style.It is a film in which mystery elements are revealed following a chronological order.Coen brothers have taken proper care of the screenplay as they have added their own material to a real life event which took place years ago.It is not at all a film about mistakes made while killing people. It is a film about human sentiments such as greed,helplessness and dedication to work.All those who like films with story are going to enjoy it.There are no special effects,animation and other high tech elements.What is to be seen in the film is pure emotional poetry-a poetry of human sentiments.The cast is outstanding especially Frances McDormand who makes a good try at being a workaholic pregnant policewoman."
"cocojaen85","10","1","2","28 March 2007"," Marvelous a 10/10
","I saw Fargo when I was 13 back in 1997. Taking into account my age, watching it could not have been the smartest thing to do. Anyways I've seen it multiple times in the past 10 years. Last night I saw it again and I remembered why I think this a marvelous masterpiece. It is probably one of the best movies of the nineties (and probably one of the best of all time). While I was viewing it, I started to (re) notice what great acting. Macy's character is just a poor scumbag, a loser, a desperate (very stupid) man. He's a failure and Macy's portrays this with brilliance. Frances McDormand's accent will be stuck with me forever, she's just inspirational. Her performance of a Small town police chief is just amazing. The way she moves and talks, her pregnancy that somehow makes you think she's vulnerable, but turns out to be a very intelligent strong woman.We saw a beautiful character, one of those characters that will defeat time (like Vito Corleone, Guido from 8 1/2 or Death form the Seventh Seal, among others of course). The two stupid and completely caricaturesc ""hit-men"". Buscemi and Stormare are on of those ""odd-couples"" that entertain even when they're killing almost for fun. As an example when they get to the cabin and Lundeergard's wife tries to flee blindfolded, Buscemis laughter is so sarcastic with Stormare's stare looking as she falls down. It's a magnificent scene of two criminals with no humanity, no respect, real bastards, and we laugh as they do. Those long scene of snow and snow and snow. We literally get immersed in this nothingness, the same nothingness that everyone has in it'soul and mind in the film, exception would be Marge's marriage. Before To begin closing this commentary, I've always liked the music, I think it's also brilliant. So depressive, so tragic, a great enhancer for every scene. The Cohen brothers created a masterpiece and they (alongside the actors) are to blame. Beautiful photography, great directing and a script that contains amazing dialogue makes this movie perfect. That dark humor of the Cohen brothers, gives you a relief as you see people that are decadent and selfish (but most certainly stupid like the 2 criminals or Lundeergard) create schemes and plans to get money, as if money was what you need the most in life. Marge has everything this sick people want, she has a life, a persona, she is intelligent, deductive, full of love for her husband and a baby. To connect this 2 last paragraphs, at the end Marge states (while driving Stormare): ""for what? (talking about all the dead people) For a little bit of money. There's more to life than a little money, you know. Don't you know that? And here ya are, and it's a beautiful day. Well, I just don't understand it."" That last line could've been said by Garcia Marquez or Shakespeare. She says ""and it's a beautiful day"" while all we see is snow, and a lonely depressive background, ""I just don't understand"" she says next. Of course she can't, she can see beauty on a depressive scenery and she has the humanity everyone else lacks off."
"Jake23232000","Null","1","2","7 July 2006"," Prairie Home Companion Goes Feral
","Fargo is a combination of Prairie Home Companion, In Cold Blood, Abbott and Costello, and The Great Gatsby.<br/><br/>Jerry, through an ex-con (Shep) in his auto dealer's shop, hires two losers he doesn't know to kidnap his emotionally stunted wife to secure a ransom out his wealthy, domineering father-in-law, purportedly to relieve Jerry of some ambiguous financial difficulties, which we have no difficulty believing that Jerry has brought upon himself through his own stupidity and neurotic venality. He thus sets in motion two losers, who buy into the scheme, much as a Florida retiree buys into some new aluminum siding. When Jerry hires the losers, it's invincible stupidity meets invincible stupidity, but the losers live in a native world of casual violence, casual sex, and casual death, a world unfamiliar to Jerry, who lives trapped in his closed make-believe world of suburban Minnesota chirpiness, Lutheran uprightness, and nuclear family happiness.<br/><br/>Once Jerry unleashes his stupid plot, he squirms and wriggles as the losers bungle and bully their way into Minneapolis, kidnap his wife, and attempt to collect the ransom. When they're finished, 7 people have died violently, a million dollars has changed hands, 3 hookers have been banged, countless beers consumed, and Jerry ends up in cuffs on a bed in a dingy motel outside Bismark, North Dakota. The sheer incompetence and casual violence of Jerry's henchman attract the law, in the person of the irrepressible Marge (""You betcha!""), who is led inevitably to Jerry's auto dealer office to ask about a certain ""tan Cierra"" with dealer plates, used by the killers to traverse the great Northern Tundra of winter-time Minnesota to find bars, screw truckstop hookers in cheap motels, kidnap suburban housewives, and extort a million from upper Midwest Masters of the Universe like Jerry's father-in-law. You're darn tootin'! <br/><br/>With the exception of Marge, and her univocal husband Norm (who paints duck stamps), none of the characters comes off well. Their overriding characteristic is their overpowering banality and stupidity, relieved in the end solely by mindless, undirected violence. The pathological interaction between the two kidnappers reminds one of In Cold Blood, although these kidnappers are not explored in any depth, their pathologies nonetheless on full display to the modest, introverted personalities of northern Minnesota. Their mere presence attracts interest, and, finally the law. Ya know?<br/><br/>The Cohen's brilliance lies in the conception of intersecting Jerry's eminently phony life and character and his petty, overblown and self-absorbed middle class problems, with the casual violence and nihilism of the kidnappers, who although they are perfectly willing to work a deal for American cash have business methods of their own, methods that Jerry doesn't want but to which in the end Jerry casually acquiesces. When Jerry places the frozen body of his now dead father-in-law into the trunk of his car, and then drives into his suburban garage, Jerry's character is writ large. The contrast between the smarmy Prairie Home Companion accents, households, restaurants, and manners of Jerry's world and the brutal, unashamed profanity of the kidnappers -- and their inevitable merger in the character of Jerry -- keeps the plot moving to its dullish, inevitable end.<br/><br/>Because no character is great in this movie, there is no tragedy. Its characters are actually embodied emptiness, whether its the slimy Jerry, his stunted wife, the emotionally sadistic father-in-law, the nihilistic kidnappers, Marge's empty-headed police partner, Marge's old high school buddy, or the air-headed truckstop hookers. There is in fact no morality or transcendence anywhere in this movie, except perhaps in the final triumph of Marge's dogged goodness and simple intelligence. The only great characters in the movie are the painters, the Hautmans, against whom Norm competes in the duck stamp competition, but who never appear. Neither does their work. True greatness has no place in this world; it can only be talked about."
"Boba_Fett1138","10","1","2","26 April 2006"," One of the most cleverly written, subtlety made and acted comedies of all time. A modern masterpiece.
","On the surface, ""Fargo"" is a very simple movie. It has a simple script and dull 'normal' characters. However due to the way the story is written en acted out by its actors, the movie becomes an absolute masterpiece and the power of the movie is in its 'normal' every day characters who are all in one way or another quite idiotic. The movie however doesn't force anything and all of the characters in the movie are portrayed as normal every day persons. Yes, all of the characters have their shortages but in a way, haven't we all? It makes the characters extremely realistic and it makes their actions all somewhat understandable, so we can easily relate to all of them.<br/><br/>Even though the story itself might be quite simple, it's still an enjoyable and well written one. It has some good turns and unexpected events. But it really is the subtlety of the story that makes it truly so brilliant. Nothing in the movie feels forced or over-the-top, despite the fact that the events in the movie come across as idiotic and unlikely in some cases.<br/><br/>It's not a comedy that really tries to be funny. It's more of a dark-comedy that through its subtle made sequences becomes really funny at times. I mean the kidnap sequence has got to be one of the most subtlety comical sequences ever made, when the kidnappers walk up on the porch, peek through the window but don't see anybody sitting while the victim, who is watching a lame TV-show, on the other hand clearly can. Or when the foot with a white sock is still sticking out of the wood chipper. Or the moment when father and son have a serious talk and afterward when the father closes the door, a poster of the accordion king is shown. It's extremely dry made and it are subtlety directed and acted sequences like these that make ""Fargo"" such a great piece of comedy and without doubt one of the best movies of the '90's, if not of all time. Every moment in the movie is build up extremely well and even though the movie is slow, it never becomes dull because of the great build up. The biggest joke of the movie is the fact, that despite the claim on the beginning of the movie, this movie is not based on a true story at all. I don't know why but I find this an absolutely brilliant touch from the Coen brothers. <br/><br/>Like I said before, all of the characters are in one way or another quite idiotic and losers and they all have their certain shortages, which makes them all very humane and easy to relate with at the same time. The characters certainly are one of the reasons why this movie is so incredibly enjoyable to watch. The accents are crazy and all of the characters are perfectly portrayed by its actors. Frances McDormand even received an Oscar for her role. The movie itself was nominated for a total of 7 Oscars, including Best Picture but it only took home 2, for McDormand and the script written by the Coen brothers. Other notable great actors in the movie are Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare as the almost amateur like kidnappers, William H. Macy as the weak person who hired them to kidnap his wife and Harve Presnell as the tough father-in-law.<br/><br/>The depressing and boring white background of the town of Fargo and its environment works perfect for the slow and odd story. It even makes the characters somewhat more understandable. I mean, can you just imaging a normal person living in Fargo? The cinematography by Roger Deakins and the musical score by Carter Burwell all add to this fantastic movie atmosphere of ""Fargo"".<br/><br/>Wonderful directed, build up and timed, with great performances from all its actors. One of the most original and brilliant (dark)comedies ever created. An essential must-see, despite the fact that perhaps not everyone will 'understand' and appreciate this movie its subtlety.<br/><br/>10/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

It was a Saturday night, it had to be some kind of a scary movie to have a little fun. I had heard a lot about this movie, my sister kept praising it, and a lot of IMDb fans as I can see from the #101 rating on the top 250 love it as well.<br/><br/>""Fargo"" is a great film. The acting is phenomenal, the story, even though my sister said it really isn't true, is disturbing, and the whole movie is just a good one to watch. I want to talk about what the movie is about, but I'm not even sure if words could describe this story. It's very disturbing, this was not meant for children in any way. I know this sounds silly, but before the kidnapping of the wife, for a few minutes I thought it was actually a comedy. While even after that and a few disturbing scenes, you still laugh. It's a very dark comedy with very dark drama.<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie, but not for the faint of heart. It's a little too much to handle if you can't stand gore.

Brilliant.<br/><br/>This is one of my all time favorite movies. I saw it the first day it opened in New York City, and I loved it. I've seen it again since. What strikes me during repeated viewings is the spareness of it. Fargo moves very quickly and there isn't anything peripheral in it, no fillers. It's just a great movie and a great story with great characterizations. Wow, when I put it that way, it sounds like anyone could do it. Would that were true.<br/><br/>There's no point in going through the story. I'll just write that Frances McDormand is sensational, as is everyone in the film - she and William H. Macy are standouts. You can really feel his desperation.<br/><br/>There are so many great scenes - when Marge thinks she's going to barf, the scene with Macy referenced above, her little lecture to the criminals, the stamp discussion. And who can forget her old friend from high school? That scene is priceless! I also love the endless expanse of snow when the search for the money begins.<br/><br/>This film was a real high point for me.

","I'm sure that many have commented on this, but I haven't heard any discussion of this point. When the Buscemi character and his cohort were pulled over outside of Brainard (with Mrs.Lundegaard tied up in the back seat), was it the suspicion of bribe (Money was protruding out of his wallet when he presented his license and registration) that caused the trooper to ask Buscemi to ""step out of the car""? Or was there something else? Also, the younger Lundegaard had a poster of a master accordion player on the inside of his doorway. Is accordion music a popular genre for the youth in Minnesota? or was a humorous take on the quaintness of the region?"
"niklas-krogerus","10","1","2","11 February 2005"," Extra points for making me feel like an asshole
","Fargo, for me, was quite a powerful experience, some of it, admittedly, on account of the latitude factor. You see, I happen to live a bit to the north, and quite a lot to the east of the movie setting (and Fargo is proof that an ocean cannot separate two nations united by hockey!). As such, I have seen for myself how the obsessive mentality of the west fuses with the ""conditioned-by-the-elements"" type characters of the north, to create some very confused individuals (this is stereotyping, but you get the idea).<br/><br/>They call it a dark comedy, but it would perhaps be more appropriate to say that it is a kind of line dance between the tragic and the comical, leaning one way and the other (usually both ways at once, actually) but never once stumbling. This extremely potent -if difficult- combination, coupled with an assortment of grand themes and some of the most interesting twists on archetypal characters I've seen, form what can only be called a masterpiece. There is no ""fat"", in fact, there's hardly a scene that isn't absolutely riveting, and the acting is generally good, with a few excellent performances. Oh, and I cried a little at the end. I did have one small problem the movie though.<br/><br/>Fargo isn't exactly culturally sensitive. I thought that ""Mike Yanagita"" the Asian-loser-pervert was a bit of a cheap shot, not to mention the violent, drugged out, native American mechanic named ""Proudfoot"", and many others. I had an especially ""good laugh"" (well, I did and I didn't) at the car chase scene. Many of you probably missed this, but ""Gaer Grimsrud"" (that's Peter Stormare's character -what kind of name is ""Gaer Grimsrud"" anyway?) exclaims ""vittu"" (that's the f-word for you non-Finns) in a Swedish accent while hunting down those unfortunate passers-by. Grimsrud is one mythical Finn you'll never see in a Finnish movie; although he really is just a ridiculously exaggerated Finnish stereotype, this breed of northerner certainly isn't treated with the same sympathy as the inhabitants of Brainerd! Now this stung a bit (especially when Grimsrud executed that poor adorable girl in the car wreck, that was heartbreaking), but I for one have no trouble swallowing my national pride -GENIOUS goes a long way to make up for the insults, and I get a feeling that it was all intentional anyway: a big fat **** you to political correctness."

Partly because it was such an odd story and partly because the people of North Dakota were portrayed so inaccurately. As I was watching, I was looking forward to seeing how they would present these totally unique people to me and I was sorely disappointed. Perhaps it's because much of my family originates from North Dakota, but i was hoping to see a part of someone I could recognize, but all the people were just simple, everyday stereotypes of Midwestern folk.

"dr_foreman","9","1","2","26 March 2004"," even better than you've heard
","""Fargo"" seems to be drawing flak lately; I think it's part of an anti-Coen backlash. The brothers have been serving up heavy doses of irony and dark humor for years, and some viewers are getting tired of them. Still, that's no reason to retroactively criticize their masterpiece, is it? Yes, the film has a very queer sense of humor, but if things like the Minnesota accent drive you nuts, you're not getting the joke (BTW, this doesn't mean that you're stupid, just that you don't share the Coen sense of humor!). <br/><br/>I usually hate ""funny"" gore, but I do think that the violence here, though occasionally ""amusing,"" is also quite horrible and repulsive. So, it's not quite like a Tarantino film then, where violence becomes a supercool thing to emulate. What ultimately distinguishes this film from a Tarantino effort - and indeed, from the Coens' other films - is that it is, in the oddest way, sentimental. McDormand's character lends warmth and humanity to a story that is otherwise quite cold and detached. Her presence makes ""Fargo"" accessible, even if you're not a big fan of black comedy, and her ""normalcy"" elevates this above even ""The Big Lebowski,"" which is a great movie as well, but also too much of a freak-fest.<br/><br/>Enough apologies - this is one of the best films of the 1990s (surprise surprise, it didn't win Best Picture!). The photography is gorgeous, and the icy landscapes lend so much atmosphere to the proceedings. The script is fast and snappy without seeming artificial, and the acting is across-the-board great; Buscemi's comic role is often overlooked, but in fact he may give my favorite performance. Burwell's score is evocative (what a great, bombastic opening!), and it is of course a wonderful novelty to see locales in a movie that aren't in New York or California. Classic stuff."
"isitwewin5","Null","1","2","7 December 2003"," Solid, but overhyped
","""Fargo"" came out in 1996.  I saw it for the first time in November of 2003. Those seven-odd years during which the film was hyped to death as one of the best movies ever caused a noticeable ascension in my expectations.  And unfortunately, as we all know, the more a film is touted before you see it, the more likely it is to disappoint.  Such was probably the case here.<br/><br/>Here are a couple of main items that prevented me from liking it as much as the general American public:<br/><br/>1.  The plot of the film was solid, but I thought that it was a bit underdeveloped.  The film's runtime was just over an hour and a half, which may not seem too short, but in this case forced the main conflict to resolve itself a tad quickly.  In doing so, the writers (the Coen Brothers) failed to progress it to a truly noticeable climax or capture the type of characterization that is necessary in order for this sort of ""comic crime-caper"" to work.<br/><br/>2. To be fair, though, the characters were very cleverly created, and very well cast (as is the case in most Coen Brothers movies).  However, only Jerry Lundegaard's character (played by William H. Macy) is given enough screentime to truly develop.  His massive amount of screentime allows the audience to eventually notice his visible inner conflict and come to grips with him as the sort of desperate, fidgety person that he is.  Frances McDormand, who won an Oscar for her role as Marge Gunderson, on the other hand, seems to just appear on the screen at one point and then disappear a little later.  She just really doesn't bring a whole lot to the table in terms of the linear plot, as she seems to go off more on tangents and rely on a thick Canadian-esque accent (one that loses its novelty very quickly) for laughs more than anything else.  Her time on screen was apparently sufficient enough to warrant her nomination in the category of ""Best Actress"" and not ""Best Supporting Actress,"" but, in my opinion, it wasn't enough to present her for much more than surface value.  Although McDormand played the part as well as anyone could have, her character was weakly written and should not have won her a nomination, let alone an Academy Award.<br/><br/>All in all, ""Fargo"" is simply a good, watchable movie that was probably, in my case, just a victim of self-imposed over-scrutiny caused by more than half a decade of hype.

Even the scene where a couple of innocent motorists are gunned down by Buscemi and Stormare,having witnessed them commiting a vile crime didn't chill me to the bone as it should have.<br/><br/> Although well directed and the very slight moment of amusement from Buscemi and Stormare as well as McDormand.This was and is something of a disappointment for me.Even with it's bloody(and may I say predictable, anti-climatic)denounment.It's a thriller that just didn't manage to set my pulse racing.A pity I suppose as there might have been potential for a decent movie here.Sadly the Cohen brothers just wasted what was a promising premise with an uninspiring waste of an hour and a half of movie celluloid.<br/><br/>Robs Rating: * *"
"McGonigle","Null","1","2","6 August 2003"," One of the Coens' best
","My all-time favorite Coen Brothers movie remains Miller's Crossing, but this one is probably my second-favorite. It's a given that any film they make will have great photography, intelligent, snappy writing and at least a few laughs, but I'm not the first one to point out that sometimes they seem like a little too much style and a little too little substance. Such films can still be drop-down hilarious, as with The Big Lebowski or O Brother Where Art Thou, but Fargo is one that gives you a little bit more.<br/><br/>The heart of this movie is provided by Frances McDormand and William H. Macy. Their characters are very well fleshed-out and very human; to give just one example, the scene where Macy starts smashing his blotter down onto his desk in his office is almost painful to watch, because it captures so perfectly his feeling of utter frustration and helplessness. Part of the movie's genius is the seemingly effortless way that it captures the little details of its characters' lives and really makes them come alive.<br/><br/>When I just watched this movie again recently, I realized that the whole set-up -- plot, characters, setting -- is also a work of genius. It's no secret that the Coens are fans of the film noir genre and, especially, the novels that inspired it. Blood Simple and The Man Who Wasn't There are both in the style of James M. Cain (The Postman Always Rings Twice), Miller's Crossing is a clear homage to Dashiell Hammett's The Glass Key (especially the Alan Ladd film version) and The Big Lebowski is a parody of Raymond Chandler's writing style, with a burnt-out stoner sitting in for Philip Marlowe.<br/><br/>But what they've pulled off in Fargo is, conceptually, their most brilliant idea, perfectly executed. They've taken a storyline that could have come straight out of a classic thriller -- the husband who needs money, the betrayal, the murders, the plans gone awry -- and completely inverted almost every stereotypical element of such a novel.<br/><br/>Instead of being set in a big city like Los Angeles, this is set out in the boondocks in Minnesota; instead of snappy gangster patter, the characters speak in a broad midwestern accent peppered with ""yah"" and ""oh, geez"".<br/><br/>Instead of having an unmarried, cynical private eye as the hero detective, we have a pregnant police chief with a loving husband and a preternaturally cheerful disposition.<br/><br/>Instead of being shot at night with lots of shadows, much of the film takes place during the day and the dominant color in many scenes is white (snow).<br/><br/>The truly amazing achievement in this film is that the Coens could take something that's basically an elaborate stylistic joke -- a ""reverse noir"" (""film blanc""?) -- and turn it into such a funny, human and all-around great film. Don't miss this one."

","The Coen brothers are obviously skillful filmmakers, but it wasn't until FARGO until they revealed themselves as true artists, with something very valuable to say about the human condition.<br/><br/>From the opening shot to the end credits the Coens unfold their story with uncharacteristic confidence.  A car drives through the snow to a haunting violin anthem.  An awkward man meets with two criminals and asks them to kidnap his wife.<br/><br/>And the rest of the movie lives up to these first scenes, combining a cold filmmaker's eye with a real human heart.  FARGO has what a lot of other Coen films are missing: sincerity.  BLOOD SIMPLE, MILLER'S CROSSING, THE HUDSUCKER PROXY--they're all skillfully made and very unique, but really cold.  Here, they've found the perfect balance--a satire of small town Midwestern life, a cool noirish plot, but some really devastating characters.<br/><br/>Jerry Lundegaard, for example.  The guy's funny, but desperate, and you actually feel for him.  But most of all in Margie Gunderson and her husband--wow, what a great addition to an already great film.  Marge's a good person without being boring, and through Marge's eyes, the Coen's cold, ironic take on most stories is redeemed.  In the end, FARGO is a film that does more than just impress.  It moves the audience, ends up being an experience that they will never forget."

One of the best Coen brothers' movie probably second best after ""The Big Lebowski"" for this one is my weakness. <br/><br/>The thing with ""it is a true story"" worked for me perfectly. That's how I saw it which pretty much enhanced the overall perception. And I donft understand why some people complain about Coen brothers' way of manipulating. Everything was so realistic in this movie. The characters weren't very bright fellows doing not so well thought out things as how in real life is. Great performances from Steve Buscemi, Frances McDormand and William H. Macy and especially Macy. If Marge was the soul of the movie then Jerry was its brain?!? I guess. You could actually see him at the end crumbling down from the weight of his lies wanting to go to some place safe just to have a break for a while. Beautiful. So realistic as it's so simple. Great Coen brothers, great William Macy. He should've gotten the Oscar.<br/><br/>I can't tell what's exactly the genre of this movie but if I had to categorize it I would say it is a black comedy.

"glennstg","Null","1","2","29 April 2002"," Comedy? What comedy?
","(Includes spoilers)<br/><br/>First off, I've heard this one billed as a dark comedy. Personally, I didn't find the film the least bit funny, except for a few humourous bits here and there. I did, however, find this film to be very well crafted, engrossing, and overall excellent in all respects. In short, I loved this film. But I wouldn't call it a comedy...<br/><br/>William H. Macy gives an outstanding performance as a car salesman whose plot to get some instant cash (which he desparately needs to get out of debt) goes terribly awry. Equally outstanding was Frances McDormand as the small-town police chief who puts all the pieces together.<br/><br/>One final comment: Many people have questioned the scene in which<br/><br/>Marge Gunderson (McDormand) has a drink with an old high-school classmate, saying the scene was pointless and unnecessary. I disagree. (Here's where the spoiler comes in.) Up until then, Marge was taking Jerry Lundegaard's (Macy) story at face value. Then she has a drink with Mike, who tells her about how he married someone they both knew from high school, who died of lukemia a year ago, and he is so lonely now... The next morning, Marge finds out that Mike's sob story was a load of bull, and she swallowed it hook-line-and-sinker. It is then that she starts to suspect that maybe Lundegaard's story wasn't completely on the up-and-up. It's the experience with Mike, and her subsequent discovery that she was easily fooled, that plants the seeds of doubt in her mind about Lundegaard.<br/><br/>(Just had to say that.)"
"Spleen","9","1","2","6 August 2000"," Triumph of parts over whole
","There are many incidental pleasures in ""Fargo"", but where's the structure? I recall reading a definition in one of those concepts-for-which-we-have-no-words dictionaries: ""a book in which everything is clear except the author's purpose in writing it"".  Here is the cinematic equivalent.<br/><br/>For those who want to excuse the film's messiness as the result of being based on a true story ... well, guys, I don't know how to say this: it isn't.  That ""the events you are about to see"" opening statement is a simple lie.  They made it all up.  I don't know about you, but I'm not inclined to just shrug my shoulders and say, ""oh, well""; this is AT BEST the Coen brothers' shameful way of manipulating us into doing their work for them. They should use craft to make us accept their stories, not deceit.  No doubt they can pass it all off easily enough as a postmodern joke, but to tell the truth, I'd thought the Coen brothers were above postmodern jokes - and they are.  ""Barton Fink"" was one of the best films of the 1990s.  ""Fargo"", thanks to its shapelessness, fails to live up to the other three Coen works I've seen.  (In case you're interested, the remaining two are ""Miller's Crossing"" and ""The Hudsucker Proxy"".)<br/><br/>And yet, and yet ... Particular plot elements, individual scenes, certain characters and aspects of people's characters, are so fascinating, so artfully drawn ... it's frustrating.  Lundegaard is a wonderful character. He's the kind of man who stumbles from one weak act to the next and would probably hate himself if he stopped to think about his actions at all.  It was very clever of the Coens to begin his story in the middle.  We're never told exactly what fraud he's trying to cover up by kidnapping his wife; but we know, we just KNOW, that he committed THAT to cover up some lesser fraud, and the lesser fraud was in turn a way of saving face after he'd done some other thing, and that when we trace the chain of events back to its source we'll find ... in all likelihood, nothing.  Marge Gunderson is also a wonderful character.  She's proof that someone can be deeply, deeply good without being dull, or getting on our nerves.  Take the superb scene where she meets her old school friend in a restaurant ... but I'm reminded of what's wrong with ""Fargo"", for what's THAT scene doing in THIS movie?  I can't make it out.  ""Fargo"" really baffles me.  So many good parts, a curiously unsatisfying whole; great throughout, good overall."

But the balance between noir and comedy resulted in a tie, with no spectaculars... Of course a movie may have a complex order, but it always needs an order. Here we see scenes that don't have a direction, every one going its own way. It looks like a collection of random shots. As for humor, there are some hilarious lines, but I really mean 'some'.<br/><br/>I understand somebody may appreciate it more than me and give it a 7, but anything above is pure overrating.<br/><br/>In conclusion, if you've heard about Fargo and hope to find that particular humor in it, you'd better see 'The Big Lebowsky'."

All the characters in the film, except the cold-blooded sociopath, are portrayed as slightly falling behind in their mental development. Both their actions and how they are portrayed by the cast cause chronic embarrassment transfers throughout the film. Something like that would work in some types of comedy, but with such characters and acting, to call this movie a drama or a thriller ... WTF ?! Directing also has nothing to do with these genres. Drama and tension do not occur even in trace amounts. The story may be a true event, and in reality it was probably a drama and a thriller, but the way it is presented in this movie is totally frivolous. It had the potential for upsetting drama, for a suspenseful thriller, and even for a morbid comedy, but this mix of the Coen brothers looks like a clumsy result of their hesitation to opt for the genre.

","""Fargo"" (1996) is a professionally produced crime drama about a kidnapping unraveled by small-time cop Marge Gunderson, played by Frances McDormand. Jerry Lundegaard, played by William H. Macy, hires two thugs to kidnap his wife in order to ransom her to his father-in-law to pay an undisclosed debt. I really enjoy films that I can identify with, rather it's the situation or specific character, or something that transports me into a different realm, unfortunately this film did neither for me. This film seems overly silly for such a serious genre that is based on true events. I am not a fan, but I can appreciate the unconventional approach.<br/><br/>I have never been to either Dakotas nor Minnesota, outside of the airport, to attest to how they actually speak, but if they really sound like that, I may have to bite my tongue in saying it really hurt this film. I think I would have really enjoyed this film if there were less accents to detract from the storyline. This film, for me, painted everyone that wasn't rich as some type of simpleton with the silly accents, which by the end of the film is unfounded, especially for one particular character. The storyline, for as crazy as it is, especially based on real events, is really strong and followable. Overall, that one aspect mostly ruined the film for me as a viewer but allowed me to really appreciate other nuances in the beautifully shot cinematography. My recommendation to this film is solely for those who wish to approach a genre a little different."

","""Fargo"" is an American movie from 20 years ago and despite some well-received earlier work, it was the big breakthrough for the Coen Brothers as writers and directors that won them an Academy Award as well. And it also won lead actress Frances McDormand (married to one of the Coens) an Academy Award. I see some people debate her being a lead in this film, but I guess I agree that she is. Yes she is not in it the first third of the film, but afterwards she is probably the main character. The other thing debatable here is William H. Macy's supporting nomination. Not only is he first credit, but nothing in terms of the action would have happened without his decision to stage his wife's abduction. Wrong category for sure, he is undeniably lead.<br/><br/>Now, let us talk a bit about this film. I believe the biggest strength here is the writing. it is tense, dramatic, a great crime story and also extremely funny on some occasions. My favorite moment was probably when McDormand's character (perfect wife, perfect cop) was examining the very first crime scene on the highway. Hilarious stuff and her cop colleague was just great with what he said and how he said it. It is always the Coen's strength to make minor characters really entertaining and memorable and this one is another brilliant example for their great talent. I would probably not agree with McDormand's Oscar, but I still think she was pretty good and maybe the heart and soul of the film. It has mostly to do with her being a good casting choice and especially with the way she was written. This film here is one of the rare exceptions that has either completely good or completely bad characters and it's a great achievement by the Coens to make this work.<br/><br/>The cast includes more known names, such as Steve Buscemi, whose character is as ill-fated as it gets here with all he has to go through the longer the film goes on. And with ""longer"", I am talking about no more than 95 minutes which is really short, not only for the Coens, but in general, but that's perfectly fine. This runtime keeps the film nicely on spot and focused. Plus, the setting in the snowy town of Fargo helps the atmospheric touch as well. And there are many great scenes in terms of camera work that function extremely well with the strong writing. The Coens prove that they were already masters of their craft back then. I recommend watching Fargo and I got curious about the relatively new television show now too. Maybe I will watch it at some point. Talking about this movie finally again, I want to emphasize once again how much fun it is to watch the characters here with all their quirks and actions. Extremely memorable. Go check it out."

Strong performances by most of the characters is also one of the big strengths of this movie and the music certainly enhances the overall impact and appeal.

","Any film made by the Coen brothers is worth a look. They have that rare talent among American filmmakers where their movies speak in a singular voice, something that makes their work fresh and original, even when they utilise familiar plot lines. And in the case of Fargo, they take the standard story of a kidnapping plot, inhabit it with some extraordinarily memorable characters, and direct it to such an engaging degree it becomes a modern classic.<br/><br/>I didn't always like Fargo. The unique and offbeat style of the Coens doesn't always lend itself easily to a storytelling narrative. And on my first viewing of Fargo, I was left very puzzled by the film. I couldn't quite grasp it, because of the way it contrasts light humour with some very black overtones. I found it to be a very overrated film.<br/><br/>But there was something about Fargo that remained ticking in the back of my mind. And I decided to give it another whirl one night. And a funny thing happened. I really started getting into it. I found myself cracking up at the strangest things. The way it was directed impressed me, and by the end, I'd fallen in love with the film.<br/><br/>Fargo makes use of a staple of film-making that has cropped up over the last 50 years. The kidnapping plot. But this being a Coen brothers film, you know beforehand things won't unfold in the traditional scheme of things. Kidnapping plots seldom turn out the way they're supposed to on film. Otherwise there would be no interest. But in the hands of the Coens, Fargo proceeds at such a bizarre pace, this plot goes horribly wrong in the most spectacular way imaginable. And then some.<br/><br/>Jerry Lundegaard (a suitably loserish William H Macy) walks into a bar an hour late to meet with two lowlifes, Carl and Gaear, to discuss a proposition. He needs his wife kidnapped, who is the daughter of Jerry's boss Wade Gustafson (Harve Presnell). Jerry is on the verge of bankruptcy after an insurance swindle went bad, so he figures another swindle will get him out of this jam. Jerry will claim Carl & Gaear demanded $80,000 in ransom, and when Wade pays up, Jerry takes the amount he needs to pay off his debts.<br/><br/>But Jerry is not the sharpest pencil in the box. Since he's not a particularly good salesman, it means he's not a particularly good judge of character. Otherwise his instincts would have told him that Carl & Gaear are not expert kidnappers. And when they end up killing a state trooper and two innocent passersby, its just the beginning of an escalating body count and a fiasco of monumental proportions.<br/><br/>The first half hour carefully sets up the events. The plot. The kidnapping. The accidental murders. All set against the frigid backdrop of Fargo. Its at this point it introduces the film's best character, Marge Gunderson (a wonderful performance by Frances McDormand), the local police chief. A 7 months pregnant waddling ball of cheery chirpiness, its up to her to unravel the mystery and close the book on it.<br/><br/>McDormand captures the attention from the second she arrives. You couldn't imagine the film without her, which is why the first 30 minutes seem like they're just waiting for her to turn up, and when she does, all of the plot strands seen beforehand finally click into place.<br/><br/>McDormand plays Marge very deceptively. At first glance, she appears as a smalltown hick, forced to move up into the big leagues when these triple murders come her way. She gives the impression that with her Midwestern drawl she's a little slow on the uptake. And because her acting is so good, I actually bought into that. But she gradually reveals to us that her mind is as sharp as a tack. She correctly intuits the chain of events that eventually lead her back to Jerry.<br/><br/>I love the scenes when she questions Jerry. Watch the way she fixes him with her penetrating stare, a big smile on her face that betrays none of her true emotions. Her deceptively pleasant demeanour wears down Jerry's resolve, until he's practically ready to confess everything. Sort of like Columbo. Only of the pregnant variety. Marge should get her own TV show.<br/><br/>All of the cast give excellent performances. In a part Macy was born to play, he gives an impeccably controlled response to what is (in his mind) the perfect plan gradually unravelling around him. And Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare are superb as the chalk and cheese scumbags who make a complete hash of the plan. The Coen's typical black comic approach is prevalent in their scenes. You won't forget the wood chipper scene in a hurry.<br/><br/>The ending is a surprisingly moving one. Not to mention philosophical. And its McDormand's character who provides that emotional key at the end. She sums up the entirety of the plot in just a few sentences, that really left me breathless. Fargo is by far the Coen brothers most intelligent and well rounded work. Its not often that you can call a film that clocks in at 90 minutes a modern classic. Fargo is such a film."
"pixelpusher2001","10","1","3","5 January 2007"," tremendously entertaining
","Of all the Cohen Brother's tremendously entertaining movies, this is the best. This is the one that they will be remembered for. William H. Macy plays Jerry Lundegaard, a man in a spot. He's a used car salesman that has been securing loans for cars that are not really in his lot. The bank is calling in the loans, threatening legal action, and he needs money fast. He forms a plan to have his own wife kidnapped, thereby splitting the ransom money between himself and the kidnappers. It's a terrible plan, and it quickly unravels into a bloody mess of murder and betrayal. When bodies begin to mount, a local police officer, Marge Gunderson, is called in. Frances McDormand plays Marge Gunderson, and she makes the movie magical.<br/><br/>McDormand won an Oscar for the role, and this is one instance when the recipient deserved the award. She plays ""Margie"" with a huge dose of humanity. She is a character that sneaks up on you. When she is introduced, you wonder if perhaps she is just a small town officer in way over her head. She is pregnant, speaks in small town (Minnesota) idioms, and throws up from morning sickness when investigating the first brutal murders. She seems more like a nice, Minnesotan housewife than a cop. But early you get the feeling that there is something special about her. <br/><br/>The killings involve a traffic cop that was killed while issuing a ticket for a missing plate. In his log book, he was written DLR. When Marge's fellow officer says that he has run a search for all tags starting with DLR, Marge says gently, ""I'm not sure I agree with you 100 percent on your police work there, Irv."" She explains to Irv that DLR means that it was a new car, a dealer's car. ""Oooh"" says Irv, staring into space. Then Marge tells Irv a joke about the guy that couldn't afford a vanity license plate, so he changed his name to FGS1135. ""That's a good one,"" says Irv, but it is clear Marge's wit has gone over his head. <br/><br/>The brilliance of the scene is that Marge is never cruel or condescending to Irv, never thinks less of him, and is not making fun of him. She is simply enjoying her own intelligence, and we can see the very private sparkle in her eyes."
"Flagrant-Baronessa","8","1","3","19 December 2006"," This is possibly the most sincere film I have ever seen
","It is not the most realistic criminal romp ever carved out, but there is an underlying and even fundamental sincerity in its gallery of supporting characters and in the fumbling folksiness with which they interact in the chilly north of Minnesota. 'Fargo' is the reason Roger Ebert loves movies so much. Although I do not share his same gushing love for the film  or indeed, for the Coens  'Fargo' is so well-written, well-acted, well-executed and well-condensed that I find no tangible reason for why I should not feel this way about it.<br/><br/>The title 'Fargo', much like its story, is misplaced. It briefly opens in Fargo, North Dakota but soon plunges into the barren, frigid smalltown of Brainerd in Minnesota, capturing the chill atmosphere of the setting with effortless conviction, probably because the Coens grew up in these North woods. Here Joel Coen directs and Ethan produces, but with deft, personal pen strokes by the both of them. They apply the same meticulous familiarity to their characters with Frances McDormand and William H. Macy in the front row, two smalltown people so heartwrenchingly sincere they completely carry the film.<br/><br/>William H. Macy is a push-over car-salesman with financial difficulties who resorts to hiring two sleazeball, violent but fumbling criminals to kidnap his wife to blackmail his domineering father-in-law. A talkative, neurotic and ""funny-looking"" Steve Buscemi and a hard-edged, strong-silent-type Peter Stormare (my country's finest export, for sure) botch their way through this kidnapping heist, killing three people in the process, which raises the stakes and sets Frances McDormand's tough (and 7-months pregnant) cop character Marge after them. She is an apt and no-nonsense chief, and one hell of a genuine, likable and cheerful character  quite possibly the best role written for a woman  rightfully earning her an Oscar for Best Lead Actress.<br/><br/>Macy was also nominated as Best Supporting Actor and it is a crime he did not win it. Here is a pathetic and realistic middle-aged small-town car sales executive, under the thumb of his father-in-law and desperate for a little bit of money to gain some dignity. Macy's performance as Jerry Lundegaard is unspeakably emotive and had the Coens chose to, he could have carried Fargo all the way to the end by himself. As it is, there is no need for it. The Scandinavian names all ring true to me (as a Swede) and the local jargon is pleasantly peppered with ""oh jeez"", ""dern tootin'"", ""ya"", ""you betcha"" and ""d'heck do you mean?"". This is the Coens in their own element.<br/><br/>'Fargo' is a black comedy but it is never laugh-out-loud worthy, except in one of the early scenes in which a shocked Steven Buscemi exclaims ""Oh daddy!"" after Stormare has killed a cop in the heat of the moment. Most of the humour in fact stems from the underlying absurdity of the situations and the depth of its characters. It is probably an apt conclusion to draw that its success stems from the very same things.<br/><br/>8 out of 10"
"Spuzzlightyear","9","1","3","14 April 2006"," I agree with Roger Ebert on this one...
","He calls it an ""American Masterpiece"" and I can't say I disagree with him. Fargo truly is one brilliant piece of film-making, the absolute top of the Coen's mountain (before slipping a bit with Lebowski and then slip-slipping downward after that). This complicated screenplay about a hostage-taking-for-hire is pure brilliance from the start, and it's the acting that takes it one step beyond that. William Macy and Francis McDormand's characters are in my mind two of the greatest characters ever developed for film. Macy's Jerry Lundegaard has all the best lines though, and Macy is tres funny, even when he's giving dead serious lines. This is a movie I can watch over and over again (and in fact, I have)"
"ryangilmer007","5","1","3","11 March 1999"," yeah, ya don't becha
","This film is a tad over-rated.  Maybe it's the continuous pounding of forced Minnesota accents or the bloodiness of the story,  but it is unsettling. First,  Minnesotans (or minnesooootans) don't talk this way all the time (I rarely hear it--; at least this pronounced).  Secondly, A Simple Plan (in my opinion) is a better film.  I like the winter scenes in both movies and the story lines are both at least good.  However, Fargo goes a little too far.  Aspects like the chipper are good/funny, but a continuous pounding of the ""yeah, ya bechas"" is too much.  Understandably it is a little funny to make fun of the midwesterners that have a pro-wrestler governor, live in the ""cold"", (had the gall to make Might Ducks 2+3), and have made fun at New Yorkers and others in the past, but there is such a thing as too much of a bad/good thing."

","Fargo is the best film from the Coen brothers yet. This movie is perfect. The cast is great and the direction is outstanding. The script is well thought out and the cinematography from Roger Deakins is brilliant. I would also like to comment on the score from Carter Burwell and say that it is his best to date. There is not a wasted frame in this film. One of the best films I have ever seen period."

OK, a little weirdness with those irritating accents, a whole bunch of blood in a few places, but... As you can see, I'm having a tough time coming up with something to SAY about this... BORING piece. I hate to say it, but despite what some have impled, intelligence has NOTHING to do with watching this film, and I am very disappointed. In fact, the Big Lebowski was even worse, and I hope that the last two films are not a sign of deterioration in a previously great Coen  brothers duo."
"baumer","10","1","3","26 June 2000"," Even though it's serious, it's just so darn funny!
","This is a strange film.  Most of the time, when it comes to films that are reality based, I get tired of them real fast.  Take a film like Affliction. That film was about an alcoholic father and the abuse of his sons.  It got real old real fast because there was just too much reality in there.  And it didn't manage to mesh the reality with even a modicum of entertainment. Fargo is different.  This is a very serious film with a whole slew of funny moments.  I don't think I have laughed this hard in a film when people weren't doing anything particularly funny.  But when a guy with a shovel in his hand tells you than there are clouds coming in over the horizon, and you find that gut-splittingly funny, then you are in for a special film.  Fargo is that film.<br/><br/>But besides the hilarity, what makes this film work is the breakthrough performance of William H. Macy.  Macy plays Jerry Lundergard the only way he should be played.  Lundergard is a troubled man.  He is in some financial difficulty and he has rich relatives that wouldn't give him any money for any reason.  They don't particularly like him.  Lundergard is a normal man. He comes from a small town and he ends up hatching a big scheme to get the money.  He will have his wife kidnapped and then set up a ransom for her that will go to him.  His wife won't be harmed and then he can pay off his financial debt.  So he hires a couple of idiots, violent idiots, but idiots nonetheless.  Of course this being a crime movie, and a Coen crime movie at that, everything is going to go wrong.  And it does.<br/><br/>Macy captures the true feel of what it would be like to be in Lundergard's position.  He is nervous.  He is nervous because he is so inept at crime that he hasn't even bothered to get the kidnappers phone numbers and he tried to supply them with a car by smudging some numbers when sending in a fax to GM.  In one of the best scenes in the film, what starts out as a friendly meeting between Marge, the police detective, and Jerry turns into disaster for Jerry.  He can't even lie well enough to a police officer who really isn't questioning him about the crime, just the possibility that the crooks stole a car from his lot.  Now I'm no expert in kidnapping, but wouldn't it have been better for him to just say that he had a car stolen from the lot?  But he can't even figure that out properly.<br/><br/>Marge is played by Academy Award winner Frances McDormand.  She is from the small town of Fargo, she is pregnant and she has trouble starting her car in the morning.  But she is also a gifted police officer.  Upon investigating the scene of the first crime, she figures it out with common sense and logic.  "" I don't think I agree with some of your police work there..."" she tells the other officer that seems to have it all backwards.  When she gets to the big city, the first thing she does is look for a buffet, then she goes onto trying to solve a crime.  She still has her priorities straight.<br/><br/>The two kidnappers are played by Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare.  Buscemi is Showalter and Stormare is Grimsrud and they couldn't be more opposite. Buscemi is ""funny looking"" and a nervous, talkative fellow while Stormare is a quiet, almost dumb looking dork.  But they are ruthlessly violent and quick to pull the trigger.  Buscemi provides the film with some of the bigger laughs as his character is always described as being funny looking by the locals.<br/><br/>The Coens have made some movies that were considered good, although not my taste ( Miller's Crossing, Barton Fink ) but Fargo is a step above most other films.  It is smarter than any film should be and it is honest and deceptively funny.  If something is supposed to go wrong then it does.  In most films, when a crime is committed, the only reason it is solved and the good guys win is because that is the way scripts are written.  The good guys have to win because that is the formula for a film.  But in Fargo, everything that happens does so because there are reasons for it and reasons given for it.  If Marge is going to figure out the crime, she does so because she has done her homework and found out where the bad guys are. The script doesn't let her down.<br/><br/>Fargo was one of the best films to come out of 1996 and it sure as hell was much better than English Patient.  I don't think we are meant to figure out the academy though.  One year it gives out best picture to a worthy film like Titanic and overlooks unworthy opponents like L.A. Confidential and then other years it gives best picture to crap like Shakespeare In Love and English Patient overlooking films like Saving Private Ryan and Fargo. Fargo is one of the most original films ever made and it is a perfect one to watch when you are tired of the formula that Hollywood releases time and time again.<br/><br/>10 out of 10"

","Jerry Lundegaard's inept crime falls apart due to his and his henchmen's bungling and the persistent police work of the quite pregnant Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand).<br/><br/>The Coen Brothers have consistently created good content for thirty years, with almost everything they touch being golden (or at worst silver). Somehow along the way, ""Fargo"" got to be the film most associated with them (even overshadowing the cult hit ""Big Lebowski""). Nothing wrong with that.<br/><br/>This is clearly the film that got people to notice Frances McDormand if they had not already done so, and probably lead to much bigger things for Peter Stormare (one of the greatest character actors in the business today)."

","As a huge Big Lebowski fan, I searched all and everyone involved with the movie in order to find more insight-full movies and ideas. When the subject of my search was Joel Coen, I quickly went to see ""Burn Before Reading"", great cast but very disappointing in the end. Some time after, I decided to give another chance to the writer, then I found Fargo. A very well rated movie, quoted on many other productions, soon I was dying to watch it. When I finally did, I struggled to keep myself awake just to be sure I wasn't being unfair. The narrative is slow and boring, the story is just dull. Not even the good actors could save this piece from total disaster. In conclusion, Joel try the same formula every time, he stroke big time on Lebowski but felt not even close on every other try, Fargo being the worst one."
"loneoak921-1","4","1","4","4 January 2009"," This movie was too violent to be anything you could call comedy
","First of all, it is very difficult to insert comedy into a movie as violent as this one was. The makers of this movie tried and failed to do that. Forget bad language, this movie deserves an X rating for criminal cold blooded violence. When the man in the car coldly blasted a state trooper in the face with a 9mm semi-automatic pistol, I almost quit watching right there. Then, the man pursued, and killed two witnesses by shooting one in the head at close range, the other in the back.<br/><br/>Kidnapping a woman, letting her fall down a flight of stairs, then laughing at her while she hopped around in the snow blinded with a hood over her head, scared for her life,crying in panic as she tried to get away, is in no way comedy. IMO, this movie served no purpose except to give criminals ideas how to be more violent.<br/><br/>This movie should have been rated X, with no redeeming social value."

But almost NOTHING happens. I know this isn't supposed to be an action movie, but action movies are NOT the only movies where things important to the plot happens. It happens in comedies, romance movies, well, even cartoons. But not this movie. Suddenly something happens, but it is absolutely NO use for the rest of the movie. There is no change whatsoever. The movie just keeps on running for the last 45 minutes before you think ""Pheww.. Now I don't have to more of this.."" Of course, all opinions can't be the same as mine, but if you consider watching this movie, you better do a bit more considering than just for a minute.<br/><br/>If you REALLY want to see it, grab a pillow and get ready to sleep (just what I thought would be a good idea :D)"

","I had a great time watching this movie. I haven't laughed like that in front of the TV for ages. But...once it was over, it was over. In my opinion, it's really over-hyped - it's the story of Jeff (William H. Macy) who is in deep financial trouble...so he pays some small-time crooks (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wife for part of a ransom he will extract from his wife's rich father. When the deed is done and the crooks are hauling Mrs. Jeff to their hideout, a cop stops them for not having the right tab on their car, and is shot. Uh-oh, two innocent bystanders noticed! Boom-boom, dead too. About four or five other people have gone to Jesus by the end, and the movie centers around Marge (Frances McDormand), the Fargo police chief trying to track down the killers. Her performance was actually pretty good as a sensitive woman who is intentionally oblivious, refusing to let the horrible things she must witness seep in and bring her down. Since Steve Buscemi is here too, you can predict the tone of the comedy, which is very dryly hilarious - the point of the movie is to contrast tragedy with comedy for a haunting and bittersweet ending. An interesting idea, but the tragedy wasn't tragic enough, it was disaffected in an odd way. Normally gruesome scenes are trivialized in a way that I don't like. It would have been very powerful had you just felt a bit more for the characters. As was, it was slightly off-kilter and I felt it left you with nothing. Great fun, however."
"tonymurphylee","Null","1","5","3 April 2006"," This is my favorite film of all time.
","The opening shot of the film is the best. It immediately establishes how dry and strange the film is. The opening shot is just white. Eventually out of the white emerges a truck in the middle. It is soon established that what we were looking at was a road. We wouldn't have known this since we couldn't see anything that was indicating that a second ago. The plot(which the film shamelessly exclaims at the beginning is based on a true story) is pretty original. a man, Jerry Lundigard, who is behind in dept needs money. He comes up with an ingenious scheme. He is to hire two criminals to kidnap his innocent wife and ask for a ransom from her rich father. Then, when her father hands over the dough, they split it with him. The plan doesn't go as well as it should. A body count starts across the valley of Minnesota and dead bodies are found everywhere. The two criminals hideout in a cabin in the woods where they try to communicate with Jerry so they can rearrange the deal as blood has been shed by them. Meanwhile, Marge, a very pregnant police officer, gets involved as the body count rises and things get more twisted and more out-of-hand. What makes this film particularly interesting to me are the bystanders. They all sound exactly the way they are supposed to. The film takes place in Minnesota, which I am very familiar with, so the people all have accents and talk a certain way that may sound funny and quite friendly with many people who are not familiar with these kind of people. This puts the film at a really interesting angle and fits perfectly. This may sound weird to have this kind of a dark theme in a film that has such light little quirks, but somehow the Coen brothers pull it off. The theme of the film itself may not fit with many viewers. My mother rented it one time thinking that it was a comedy. She hated it. So this basically puts viewers who have not seen this film in a weird spot. The people going in to it thinking that it'll be a comedy will most likely be disturbed by the strong violence and intense feeling that this film uncomfortably radiates. The people going into it thinking that it's a thriller or a serious drama will be a little bewildered to find the film having a light sense of humor detracting from the horror and the violence. But the people going into it wishing nothing more than for it to be an entertaining film will most likely be satisfied. That being said, I really loved this movie and have watched it millions of times. There are very few people i know who, surprisingly, don't really like it. It is so weird when i see a film that, in my eyes is brilliant, but i then recommend it to somebody and they return saying nothing but how much they hated it. This film doesn't appeal to everyone. Anyway, the film's music score is so beautiful in expressing the grim looking locations and the intensity of the storyline. With it's droning violin hang downs and its low sounding rhythm, the score sounds beautiful and makes it more than worthwhile to get the soundtrack. The haters of this film have one good thing that they absolutely can't deny. The acting is completely top-notch. William H. Macy as Jerry is perfectly weaselly as the imperfect husband. Steve Buscemi(one of my favorite actors) is also perfect as the the leader of the two criminals and manages to make somewhat of a sympathetic feeling out of a wacky and sadistic guy. But it is Francis Mcdormand as Marge who truly gives the role of a lifetime as the pregnant cop who has everything to win and is appropriately cheerful when she needs to be. This film's sense of humor can be somewhat dry, but thats partly what makes the film so different. And aside from having the greatest death scene in a film since PSYCHO(1960), boasts incredible believability. This is comparable in terms of very realistic thrillers such as THE Texas CHAIN SAW MASSACRE(1974) and THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT(1999), and yet can also just about stand next to comedy classics such as PLANES, TRAINS, AND AUTOMOBILES(1987), and MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL(1972). This film succeeds in spades as being an excessively violent thriller and a chuckle inducing comedy, but what it succeeds most at doing in my eyes is be good entertainment. The ending is so haunting and yet so fitting that it truly seals the deal that this film is an American classic.<br/><br/>PROS:<br/><br/>-Incredible originality in everything<br/><br/>-stunning performances by the whole cast<br/><br/>-incredible genuine horror and humor<br/><br/>-unpredictable<br/><br/>-the most shocking and brilliant ending to a film I've seen<br/><br/>-gripping plot and characters<br/><br/>CONS:<br/><br/>-the dry humor and the graphic violence isn't for everybody"

","I don't care for this movie only because it makes a grossly false claim. As a film it has very good qualities, but the introduction states that this movie depicts a true story, which is an outright lie perpetrated by the Coen brothers to mislead the public and boost ticket sales. The false statement should be removed, and the Academy should not have allowed this film into competition until it is removed. The film also depicts the people of Minnesota and North Dakota in a derogatory stereotype, which is also false. For decades conservatives and right wingers have denounced the movie industry as immoral, which I've always found to be totally untrue. But when idiots like this start lying and presenting false or inaccurate information as fact, it starts to makes me wonder. TELL THE TRUTH for crap sake!"

","From writing and directing brothers, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated Joel, and Ethan Coen (Raising Arizona, No Country for Old Men, True Grit), I remember seeing this film once before, but I needed to see it again to really appreciate it. Basically Jerry Lundegaard (Oscar nominated William H. Macy) has financial problems, and out of desperation, in Fargo, North Dakota, he decides to hire criminals Carl Showalter (Steve Buscemi) and Gaear Grimsrud (Peter Stormare) to kidnap his own wife Jean (Kristin Rudrüd). This is in order for his father in law Wade Gustafson (Patch Adams' Harve Presnell) to pay a ransom of $1,000,000, for which the two criminals will get £40,000 of while he keeps the rest. So they kidnap the wife, but on the journey to the secluded cabin they will be keeping her in they are stopped by a policeman who Gaear kills, he also kills two witnesses who crash their car. Investigating this homicide, from Brainerd, Minnesota, is local pregnant chief/sheriff Marge Gunderson (Oscar winning, and BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Frances McDormand) who is tenacious to catch whoever committed the murders. Jerry, who did originally ask for money from Wade, which he thought he was going to get (not needing the kidnappers anymore) but didn't, gets the ball rolling for the kidnappers ransom money. Being an antagonist man, Wade is insistent that if a $1,000,000 ransom is going to be paid, he will do it himself, and of course Jerry is trying everything he can think of to make sure that does not happen. Marge's investigation leads her to the discovery that the car passing by and killing the victims was hired at the car lot that Jerry works in for Wade, he is obviously very nervous in convincing her he knows nothing about it. It comes to the money drop-off for the ransom, and Wade goes against the wishes of the kidnappers to take it himself, while Gaear keeps an eye on Jean Carl is the one to pickup. Angered by the appearance of the father-in-law and not Jerry he shoots Wade, and he ends up getting shot in the face, and after Carl leaves the parking lot, Jerry is the one to take the body of Wade away. On his way back Carl sees that the case has $1,000,000 instead of an agreed amount, so he buries some at the side of the road in the snow, and when he gets back to the cabin he finds Gaear has killed Jean. Gaear kills Carl with an axe after an argument for the car, and after questioning Jerry again and seeing him flee, Marge finds her way to the cabin where the remaining criminal is putting the body parts of his dead partner in a wood chipper. In the end Gaear is arrested for the five murders, Jerry is caught and arrested for his involvement, and Marge returns home to husband Norm (Volcano's John Carroll Lynch) and they both look forward to the two months left to wait for their baby. Also starring Tony Denman as Scotty Lundegaard, Larissa Kokernot as Hooker #1, Melissa Peterman as Hooker #2 and Steven Reevis as Shep Proudfoot. McDormand gives a nice simple performance that I can see being worthy of the accolade she received, Macy is great as the man setting up the kidnap, and Buscemi and Stormare are equally great as the hopeless but creepy criminals. The stylistic direction by the Coen brothers are brilliant, their scripting is witty, funny and full of some really good thrills, the snowy settings are worth watching, and you can enjoy both the tension and the moments that make you laugh, a fantastic black comedy thriller. It won the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing and Best Picture, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Original Screenplay and Best Film, , and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical and Best Screenplay. Marge Gunderson was number 33 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, the film was 93 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs, it was number 84 on 100 Years, 100 Movies, and it was number 31 on The 100 Greatest Films. Very good!"

","where to start. I join with those who gave negative votes in this movie, my vote is rational about what the film I had transmitted. 4/10 gravely insufficient. why? because I understand that in the end they wanted to create a bizarre story, humorous or something like this, but I really do not understand what can be fun. I will not love this kind of humor behind the lines (some scenes I appreciated and I understood the meaning behind it) but overall it was boring and too foolish to say the least. many unnecessary scenes and despite this a film that barely exceeds the hour and a half of life, incredible. I do not know how to evaluate the Oscars to McDormand surely be a good test of acting, (but also other Buscemi in the first place) but not having seen all the films nominated can not do a real comparison. For the rest I do not know, when a film so short you can not wait for it to finish or that you look at him as if to say ""so what's the point,"" there's something wrong."

","I've heard some good stuff about this film recently so I decided to watch it and see what is was about. Unfortunately I just don't get why this movie is so praised.<br/><br/>my main problem with this film is how long it takes to figure out the plot. The movie starts off well but falls apart because the majority of the film is spent saying ""what the hell is going on"" and not in a good suspense movie way but in a way that drags questions out for the hell of it. Not only that but in between all the dragging out it introduces scenes that have absolutely no relevance to the movie what so ever.<br/><br/>Another complaint is everybody's accent. I know its mean but i really hate everybody's accent to the point that I really just wanted to turn the movie off. And why the hell is everybody so happy in this movie? It deals with murder and conspiracies but everyone has a damn smile on there face, even the people getting crapped on the entire film.

Like most films, I heard about Fargo word of mouth and everything I heard was about how funny it was. Laughs they all said. Hilarious I was told...back in '96. So when it came out on pay per view in late '96 or early '97, I attempted to watch it. More than half way through, I had not so much as chuckled. As a matter of fact, I was shocked and depressed. So I turned it off. Never saw the end. Then I had some conversations with my friends/coworkers/colleagues who had raved about it. ""Oh you just didn't give it a chance"" they all said. ""Watch it all the way though"" I was told. So here I am 20 + years later with a new open mind, ready to be amused. Prepared for chuckles and belly laughs. And this time, I watched all the way through. <br/><br/>What did I discover? Nothing. Still depressing. Still pointless. Still completely, totally, entirely humorless. Not clever. Not interesting. Just depressing. Makes me wonder about the psychology of all those folks who raved about all the humor in this film.

No connection to the heroes and foes, no emotions towards them, just following the rope leading to the end.<br/><br/>Sporadic empty moments are battling with fun pieces and the fight finishes by the tie. Although I must admit again that the cinematography is indeed great and the music still rings in your mind after end credits.<br/><br/>In conclusion I think that if I had missed the movie I would not lose anything, but by watching it I kind of admitted to myself that I might have been a decent criminal."

Their accents are also inconsistent. I was so bored and irritated with this stupid film! The film is only 98 minutes long, and about 15 minutes are spent on a Chinese friend of Detective Gunderson (McDormand) phoning her out of the blue and coming to visit.

","Fargo was an enjoyable film and probably could be best summed up as a comedy of errors. This definitely has the stamp of the Cohen brothers on it with its tangents and side plots. The strength of this film to me is the strong performances from the cast. <br/><br/>This film is well put together and culminates in a bit of tragedy for almost everyone. It is memorable enough but I wouldn't go as far to say it's iconic and I know I'm the minority with that. A stronger plot and more focused scenes I feel works better during screen time. A number of people are fond of the various side plots/tangents that kind of lead to nowhere and don't really add value. For example the scene with Margie and person she went to school with trying to chat her up added little to the story. This is a simple and ironic story but it is certainly not of Shakespearean proportions."

","This is a true story. No kiddin. It really is. It seems so bizarre and comical, but it is truly based on real events, only the names of the characters are changed. Fargo is about a financially struggling loser played by William H. Macey. His car business is going downhill and he is desperate for extra money. This dude comes up with the idea to fake a kidnapping of his own wife and collect the ransom monye which will be paid by the extremely wealthy father of his wife. Things go sour of course. And how terribly bad things get is the brilliance of this true story. <br/><br/>The reason you must be reading this review is because you probably dont know the Coen Brothers (very well). Any fan of their work will watch everything they make, because these 2 brothers are the pinacle of absolute genius in american independent cinema. I just count the months every year waiting to see the next creation of these brothers who are both director, producer and writer of all their movies. With ""Fargo"" they made one of their best works. It became one their most popular ones too, even a series was made after this story.<br/><br/>For those who have never seen a Coen Brothers film before, a little warning: the humor in ""Fargo"" is very subtle. The Coen Brothers are magnificent in portraying their characters in a way that can be interpreted in different ways. You can look at it as a drama, but simultaneously you can also laugh about it. These brothers walk this tightrope between comedy and drama as a brilliant circus trapeze act. It makes for an unforgettable watching experience. But some people just dont understand these black comedies. The Coen Brothers style is NOT straight comedy. It is twisted and dark, but true to life and endearing simultaneously.<br/><br/>Acting performances are always great in all of the Coen Brothers movies. Just like in Quentin Tarantino's movies, these twin brother directors truly love and appreciate their actors. Excellent casting choices!<br/><br/>Huge praise for the beautiful soundtrack by Carter Burwell and for the beautifully shot desolate winter spaces of Dakota by oscar nominated photographer Roger Deakins.<br/><br/>Fargo has become a Coen Brother's favorite of mine. Not their best work, so if you like this one, please check out their earliest work and the classic ""No Country for Old Men"", those are all ultimate masterpieces of modern american cinema!"

","I bought this movie in a boxed set of Cohen Brothers movies and because I liked their early approach and style of filmmaking I scooped it right up. Blood Simple (1984) being my favorite. So I finally get around to watching Fargo. Maybe my expectations were high. Hey, the film won two Oscars. I mean, it just had to be good, right? Really good.... Nope. <br/><br/>The dominant feeling I got was boredom. I kept expecting it to get better. Patiently waiting. All the way up to the final scene. And it just never happened. Sad really. I'm trying hard to think of a memorable scene or quote. (For example: Do you remember how quotable ""Tombstone"" or ""The Godfather Part II"" was?) Or, maybe a scene where I was lost in the terrific acting. Or that place where the story reached its climax and was gripping and unforgettable. Never happened.<br/><br/>The plot was flat and disjointed. The acting was at its best mediocre. The really sophomoric attempts at what I think was supposed to be viewed as humor made the movie only more puzzling. Is it a.... comedy?! Not by a long, long shot.

","When most people think of the Coen Brothers, they turn to Fargo. It's what they are known for. It has every stylistic element that makes their movies unique and relevant. Dark, biting humor, murder, quirky characters and dialogue.<br/><br/>A sinister plot turns a husband into a criminal and a wife into a victim. The small-town folk of Fargo North Dakota are all part of the action. It's a depressing and bleak story, with not a whole lot of redeemable characters. It's all sad. The Coen weave a tragicomic tapestry with wit and substance, really and deeply creating cinematic art without pushing the audience away with any pretension.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is also memorable. A stark, grating Scandinavian fiddle sets a somber tone for the whole film. It matches the bone-white landscape of nowhere Dakota, where the tragedy unfolds for everyone.<br/><br/>The dialogue is all quotable, so witty it is. Most characters are crafted carefully and full of many brilliantly invented qualities.<br/><br/>This film is simply brilliant. Highly recommended to each and everyone. It's dark, bleak, and hilarious. Classic Coen."

","Fargo is a near perfect Coen Brothers film. It has witty banter, the perfect balance of character development and action, and a climax exceeding expectations. It is one of those few films that stand the test of time, and can entertain from beginning to end. It's dark, satirical, quirky, and fundamentally a unique flavour, catering to all aspects desired. <br/><br/>Frances McDormand is incredible as the police office in charge of the investigation, and creates the perfect character to drive such a curious and intriguing story. She does very well in carrying such a well written film, with a fantastic ensemble cast. Fargo is an incredibly low-key great film, and is created to such perfection."

","""Fargo"" works as most Coen movies. It develops a plot without any hectic, though much happens, it is almost harmonic and silent. What takes place here is more storytelling than the attempt to produce a crime film. While developing likable, odd characters, what is told here is basically not a sensational story. It has by far less twists than Burn after Reading for example and yet it makes for a good movie.<br/><br/>Unlike others, I don't consider this the best Coen title, I liked both Burn after reading as well as A serious man better. Nonetheless it is in itself a piece of art and you have to admire the Coens for having such a unique signature that you can almost from the first minute tell it is one of their films.<br/><br/>All in all, give it a try but don't expect wonders."

","It is the winter of 1987, and Jerry Lundegaard (Macy), the sales manager at a Minneapolis Oldsmobile dealership, is desperate for money. He floated a $320,000 GMAC loan to cover up his embezzlements from dealership bank accounts, collateralizing it with nonexistent dealership vehicles, and GMAC is asking questions. Dealership mechanic and paroled ex-convict Shep Proudfoot (Steve Reevis) refers him to an old partner in crime, Gaear Grimsrud (Stormare). Jerry travels to Fargo, North Dakota, towing a new car from his dealership's lot, and hires Gaear and Carl Showalter (Buscemi) to kidnap his wife, Jean (Kristin RudrÃ¼d), and extort a ransom from his wealthy father-in-law and boss, Wade Gustafson (Presnell), in return for the dealership car and half of the $80,000 ransom.<br/><br/>Back in Minneapolis, Jerry pitches Gustafson a lucrative real estate deal. Gustafson checks with his accountant, Stan Grossman (Larry Brandenburg), and agrees to front $750,000. Jerry considers calling off the kidnapping, but it is already in motion. Then, he learns that Gustafson and Grossman plan to make the deal themselves, leaving Jerry a paltry finder's fee. At Jerry's home, Carl and Gaear carry out an inept and violent kidnapping. As they transport Jean to their remote cabin hideout on Moose Lake, a state trooper pulls them over outside Brainerd for driving without the required temporary tags over the dealership plates. When the trooper notices a whimpering, blanket-covered body in the back seat, Gaear kills him. Two passing motorists spot Carl disposing of the body; Gaear chases them down and shoots them as well."

","I wasn't really sure what I was going to think of this movie when I sat down to watch it because while I don't always agree with The Coen Brothers sense of humour I've always found them to be excellent directors of action and actors and I'm glad to say that I thought this film was fantastic. Fargo has a perfect run time it never drags for a single second yet everything is wrapped up perfectly in the relatively short run time. I really thought that the accents in this film were going to get on my nerves after a while but they didn't it fit perfectly with the characters and its actually another thing that makes this film so unique. From scene one William H Macy impressed my he was just so perfect at being a pathetic and slimy human being and while you don't ever side with what he's trying to do you kind off in a way sympathise with him because of all the hardships he's has and absolutely earned his Oscar nomination. Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare were both fantastic in this film I thought they bounced of each other perfectly and created for some really entertaining dialogue scenes between the two. The whole plot of the kidnapping gone wrong was exhilarating seeing all the characters trying to avoid the law and getting caught hiding evidence and double crossing each other made for some great tension and gave this film its entertainment value but the thing I absolutely hated about this film was the character of Marge Gunderson. She stopped this movie from being perfect, don't get me wrong I thought that Frances McDormand was great in this film but the character was just so annoying her interaction with her husband was awkward and annoying to watch and at the bare minimum it just wasn't as interesting as the kidnapping plot. She just didn't need to be in this movie and it really held this film back for me. I'm not going to say that McDormand was bad in this film but I can't say that same for he character or her arc but luckily this film had far to much good in it for one character to ruin it for me. <br/><br/>I really enjoyed Fargo it's a non-stop crime thriller with a great movie plot and it's perfect paced despite the atrocious female lead. <br/><br/>84%/A-"

","The Coen Brothers do it again, adding yet another masterpiece to their collection. From it's beautiful snow covered landscapes to it's cast of amazing actors, Fargo is a thrilling crime drama with a fair amount of humor. The snowy lands of Minnesota are a pleasure to the eyes, with many shots being almost completely white. The snow helps highlight what's going on. For example, when the cop is shot, his blood stains the snow, making his splatter almost art-like. The actors are pretty funny, all of their cheesy accents truly do help the humor. Frances, the main protagonist, won an award for best lead actress for her humorous delivery of her lines and especially for her silly accent. One actor from Fargo that is easily in my top 3 would be Steve Buscemi. He looks funny, he is funny, he's just a funny guy and makes Fargo the comedy it is. Fargo is a blend of drama, comedy, and perfect shots from the ingenious Coen Brothers."

Frances McDormand plays the small town cop who investigates matters when the ""victimless crime"" spirals out of control.<br/><br/>It goes without saying that ""Fargo"" has a big reputation and it's well deserved.

What ""Fargo"" has that none of those movies have is a sense of humor. While the events are sometimes shocking and a few of the characters represent the worst in humanity, the movie's spiced with humor and I laughed throughout. A lot of the humor centers around the Minnesotan breed of the far north.<br/><br/>The film is short 'n' sweet at 98 minutes and was shot in Minnesota and eastern North Dakota.<br/><br/>GRADE: A-"
"anymouse-73569","9","0","1","5 October 2016"," Cold, cold, cold
","A guy in the community message boards described this movie as ""cold, cold, cold"" in reference to Fargo's emotional callousness. Unlike me, he didn't like the movie, but I do agree with his assessment of Fargo's coldness. This film is cold, literally and figuratively.<br/><br/>As you probably know, this movie is about car salesman called Jerry who finds himself in need of a large sum of money for reasons which are never really explained. Jerry hires two ruthless but inept killers to kidnap his wife, collect a ransom from his wife's rich family, and turn the ransom back in to Jerry. What was supposed to be a ""no-rough-stuff type deal"" quickly turns deadly.<br/><br/>Contrast is a vital element in Fargo, both in the characters and the cinematography. Bright red blood stands out against white snow. Gunshots echo through the silence of winter. Our two bad-mouthed, stone-cold killers are shown in contrast with the squeaky-clean Minnesota folks. Brutally cold snow provides the perfect backdrop for the brutally cold murders in Fargo. Periodically throughout the movie, we also get these very interesting artistic shots, including a memorable bird's-eye-view of Jerry walking to his car in the snow.<br/><br/>The little ""slice of life"" segments of the film are satisfying as well. I have never been to the North so I can't tell you if the ""Ooh, yahh""'s are overdone or not, but it was definitely entertaining to listen to. Even minor characters, like the hookers in the bar, are well-developed and endearing. Unlike No Country For Old Men, which I feel was ""made"" by one certain character (if you've seen NCFOM, you know who I'm talking about), Fargo thrives on its diverse ensemble of characters. There are no cardboard cutouts here--everyone is fully developed, human, and original.<br/><br/>Fargo pulls no punches when it comes to shocking its viewers. Lurid scenes of violence are displayed in full view. Many scenes, especially those involving Jerry's wife and her kidnappers, leave you wondering whether to laugh or to be horrified. You end up with your mouth just hanging open in equal parts shock and amusement. This is where the ""cold, cold, cold"" part comes in. Though this film is technically a comedy, a bleak feeling permeates the movie from start to finish. Fargo can be hard to watch at times. But ultimately, it grabs you, horrifies you, makes you laugh, makes you feel guilty for laughing, and never lets you go.<br/><br/>Overall, Fargo is well worth a watch. It is a well-written, well-shot work of art that fully deserves its position as a beloved cult classic. Fargo is another piece of evidence of the Coens' marvelous talent.<br/><br/>P.S.--It's not really based on a true story.<br/><br/>P.P.S.--Go Bears!"

","This is my first review and I've been a IMDb member for 9 straight years. Fargo is the type of movie that absolutely forced me to write something about it. It has been on my watch list for more than 8 years or so and I have no idea what I have been thinking by not watching it. It's the absolute definition of a perfect movie.<br/><br/>Let's start with the cinematography. For me, the snow is one of the main characters here and boy does it fit well. It actually creates this negative background that adds beauty to every scene and accentuates every color and movement. The camera unfolds slowly and steadily so you could take your time and enjoy the beautiful shots.<br/><br/>The characters and dialogue. As a big Tarantino pre-Kill Bill fan, this is a little gem. Every third line is an instant classic and is delivered brilliantly. Everyone did an amazing job (Frances McDormand absolutely killed it), nothing seemed forced or out of place and every exchange is hilarious in its own way. There is not one single scene I would cut out or one actor that did not deliver.<br/><br/>I will stop writing now because if you haven't seen it, you should do it right away instead of reading this lousy review. You're in for a treat that you will want to watch again and again for years to come."

","Well, as a ""film buff"", I've set out to watch anything and everything. And, after hearing a ton of hype for Fargo, I decided to give it a try. Now, the first half of the movie was actually pretty interesting. William H. Macy's character is one that is convincing, and is the kind of character that you just love to hate. His character is interesting, and I was getting invested. But, then the movie makes a big misstep in my opinion. That is, making Marge Gunderson the main character of this movie.I don't like this character at all. I think the performance is stiff, lifeless and her character is just so annoying. I expected this movie to be kind of similar to A Clockwork Orange, that being that even though this man is a criminal and kind of vicious, you still want to see him succeed. But, Marge is not interesting. There is zero development for her, and I don't care about her. Now, there is a lot said about the dark humor in this movie. I hear people saying that you don't know whether to humored or shocked by this movie. Well, outside of the scene where Marge is talking to the prostitutes, nothing was really humorous, and nothing in this movie was shocking. I dunno. I was born after this movie came out, so maybe it was shocking at the time, but nowadays, this is actually pretty tame. Actually, no! There was no way this was shocking to anyone even then because movies like A clockwork Orange and Reservoir Dogs had already come out by then! Look, this film does have some good performances, and the cinematography is decent, but I really can't see myself watching it more than the 2 times I already have! By no means a bad movie, and if you like it, that's fine, but i just didn't get the appeal of it."

","Fargo is a satire of the blankness and bleakness of the American Midwest. The movie is set as a crime story, but actually the Cohen brothers are poking fun at the monotonous, unimaginative, and humdrum life there under veneer of well-to-do. The thing is that the brothers are Jewish, and they were concerned that the white populace there would take the movie as what it really is—a social commentary on the goy way of life. Hence the solution, which is a racist solution—As a sop, create a nerdy and contemptible character and cast a colored person for the role, and balance it out. The Cohens picked an Asian because Asian Americans do not have an NAACP and would not picket the movie or create a ruckus unlike the blacks would have. That is why an Asian appears out of the blue in a movie set in Minnesota where less than 1% of the population is Asian. In other words, in a perverse way the Cohen brothers chose a racial solution to the political-correctness problem of their own movie. The dastardly solution speaks volumes for the Jewish brothers' essential cowardice, despite their apparent claim for making a social statement clothed in a crime story."

","It is an okay film. On the plus side, the music is quite nice.<br/><br/>I can't however really understand why it has such a high score. The story of a kidnapping gone awry is quite simple. What is quite special is how unintelligently the people in this film talk and act. Unlike most films, this one does not have really smart or powerful characters. Much of the conversations, just as in real life, is basically nonsense. So in this sense the film is realistic.<br/><br/>The problem with this realism is however that the film can get quite boring. Time is spent on events that have nothing to do with the main story. For example, the policewoman met one of her schoolmates who turned out to have some serious psychological issues. But that guy or their meeting has nothing to do with anyone else in the film.

","""Fargo"" is the modern classic that elevated the Coen brothers to the upper echelon of filmmakers working today. They'd done some fine work prior to this but it wasn't until ""Fargo"" that they got the attention that they deserved.<br/><br/>The film is set in Minnesota in 1987 and centres around a kidnapping plot that goes horribly awry. Blood is shed and yet the laughs come steadily. In retrospect, it's amazing how effectively the film balances unflinching violence and understated comedy.<br/><br/>The cast is dynamite. Frances McDormand won a well-deserved Oscar for her performance as the local police chief while William H. Macy got his big break by nailing the character of inept car salesman Jerry Lundegaard. And how can you not like Steve Buscemi & Peter Stormare as the pair of kidnappers? In fact, there's not a single performance in the film that's less than ideal.<br/><br/>Then, of course, you've got the work of the Coens to consider. Joel got the directing credit but both brothers actually collaborated, as they did with the script. The script garnered a richly deserved Oscar while the direction was recognized with a nomination. The Roger Deakins cinematography was also nominated for an Oscar but Carter Burwell's moody score was unaccountably snubbed.<br/><br/>In the end, ""Fargo"" is one of those films where almost everything works so well that it's difficult to spot even the slightest flaw. As a dark comedy, it's practically without peer. As a Coen brothers film, I'd say it edges out ""No Country For Old Men"" as the best of their career."
"Vivekmaru45","7","0","1","14 June 2012"," Q. How Many Chips Can A Wood-chipper Chip?
","A. Depends on the SIZE of your Feet! Fargo is a 1996 American dark comedy-crime film produced, directed and written by brothers Joel and Ethan Coen. It stars Frances McDormand as a pregnant(?) police chief who investigates a series of homicides, William H. Macy as a car salesman who hires two criminals to kidnap his wife, Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare as the criminals, and Harve Presnell as the salesman's father-in-law.<br/><br/>The film earned seven Academy Award nominations, winning two for Best Original Screenplay for the Coens and Best Actress in a Leading Role for McDormand. It also won the BAFTA Award and the Award for Best Director for Joel Coen at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival.<br/><br/>""Fargo opens with a title card proclaiming: ""This is a true story. The events depicted in this film took place in Minnesota in 1987."" Earnest journalists who went in search of the ""real"" woodchipper murders were outraged when, after months of wild goose chases and increasingly deadpan obfuscation by the film-makers, they finally admitted that the title card was actually an elaborate hoax - their way of ""poking a hole in the true story balloon"", according to William H Macy.<br/><br/>So Fargo was not, in fact, based on a true story. None of it really happened. There is no real ""Jerry Lundegaard"" out there."" Back to the film: William H. Macy is the best actor in this film, closely followed by my favorite Steve Buscemi. Peter Stormare complements him well in his role as the murderous Gaear Grimsrud. Not to forget the awesome cameos by Steve Reevis as Native American ex-convict Shep Proudfoot.<br/><br/>The person I hate in this film is Frances McDormand(Darkman). This b*tch has no acting talent whatsoever and spoils the mood of the film. In this film you will hear her (and some of her buddies) repeating a common phrase OH YAH! OH YAH! YAH! YAH! This gets on your nerves after a while.<br/><br/>One thing makes me wonder: how the hell can a PREGNANT local police chief be allowed to work during her pregnancy? This part I DO NOT AGREE ON.<br/><br/>The core of the film is based on a botched up kidnapping which affects the lives of many persons. The motive for the kidnapping is money (a.k.a. GREED). Greedy persons in the film are Jerry Lundegaard, an indebted car dealer who hires two men to kidnap his wife. Carl Showalter, a small-time crook hired to kidnap Jerry's wife and his psychotic partner Gaear Grimsrud.<br/><br/>Best scenes in the film: Shep beating Carl & Carl getting mince-meated during the films end.<br/><br/>This is for me the 2nd best film by the Coen Brothers, the best or 1st ranking Coen Brothers film for me is No Country For Old Men. Miller's Crossing I rank 3rd. Barton Fink I rank 4rth."

","Watched last night with the hubby. It was a first view for the both of us and I was eager to watch what, I've been told by various folks over the years, is an iconic American film.<br/><br/>This snapshot of midwestern life from times gone by (from accent to clothing to location) bordered on cartoonish at times- some of it felt too exuberant to be plausible. I also did not appreciate that the film opens with text stating that the story is true yet facts show exactly the opposite- the Coen's have given interviews which state that they took parts of true events from a bunch of different cases, wove them together to create this novel narrative, and included that text about the film's veracity because, in their opinion, if the audience believed the film was not fictional it would give them permission to show a perspective that would otherwise not be accepted. Even though I understand the Coen's explanation for lying to the audience, I still don't accept it.<br/><br/>Still, this film was dark and funny and strangely moral in its point-of-view (money isn't everything, family is what really matters, and good triumphs over evil in the end) and I absolutely loved it! This is a must see and, quite possibly, an all-time favorite!"

","Happened to be browsing through my old VHS collection the other day and came across Fargo, which I recorded back in 1999. It hasn't aged a jot and is as memorable as I well, remembered it! Watched on a crappy old TV but listened to through a decent HiFi (I've kept an excellent example of VHS HiFiness for such purposes) the standard stereo soundtrack to this film (as with all the CB's films) is superb, bringing hidden depths to the surface as the music envelopes the ratcheting tension. If only more recent movies could be as precise with their soundtracks instead of ruining them with overblown sound! Then of course, there's the excellent cast with a story that's so compelling in its telling that you become quickly absorbed and just don't want it to end! If you haven't seen this film before or it's been a while since, do yourself a big favour! Blows most of today's cinematic crap out of the water....YAAH!!"
"rileyedwardcowan","10","0","1","31 March 2012"," Should you watch Fargo? You betcha!
","Fargo is a very rare occurrence in films. It is a perfect storm of actors, writers/directors, cinematographers, and an amazing plot. Each character has their own unique traits that fit together so well that you wonder if the story is actually based on a true story.  As the plot twists around in a very entertaining way, you are brought on a ride you won't forget. The genius writing of the Coen brothers has never been this good. 'The Big Lebowski' was one of the best films I have ever seen but it doesn't have the same effect that Fargo has.  Movies like this are the reason I watch movies in the first place. It connects with you on a personal level no matter who you are, but especially if you are from the Midwest. If you have ever seen a film in your life you should have seen this one. No chance of disappointment."

","This is quirky beyond belief, even for the Coen brothers. Without giving too much away, William H. Macy is Jerry, a dishonest car salesman(redundant, I know) who through a series of money games, needs to raise a good deal of cash quickly. He arranges the kidnapping of his wife by a couple of low life's headed by the super creepy Steve Bescemi in his most evil role. <br/><br/>Jerry has the idea of having his father in law pay the ransom for his daughter. The best laid plans of mice and men soon go awry and what follows is part keystone cops and part Greek tragedy. Equal measure sardonic black comedy, violent crime drama and domestic romance, this is a brilliant work of art with a perfect script and characters so fully realized that I have to rate it a 10/10. This is a flawless film from beginning to end."
"thepsychocritic","8","0","1","23 October 2011"," In the words of Ebert: 'Films like Fargo are why I love the movies.'
","It's a pity, really. Movies having a cast of relative unknowns of the industry, which make up for their lack of publicity with a superb storyline more often than not remain buried it the DVD archives titled 'no one cares' while films starring the big-wigs, with their six-packs or saving the world antics sell like reindeer training manuals in Antartica. Unfortunately, Fargo falls dead-centre in the former neglected category, which made the satisfaction of successfully excavating for it equivalent to finding a brick of pure gold. <br/><br/>Fargo keeps all pretensions aside. It is a simplistic, home-spun, small- town dark comedy-crime film and it doesn't try to be anything else. The story is almost insultingly simple. A slightly eccentric, paranoid car salesman, Jerry Lundegaard (William Macy) is facing an acute financial crisis. He meets two criminals, Carl (Steve Buscemi) and Gaear (Peter Stormare), and makes a deal with them - they will kidnap his wife for him in return for which Jerry offers them a car and half of the $80,000 ransom he plans to mooch off his rich, antagonistic father in law, who also happens to be his boss. They kidnap her successfully but the coup soon goes awry resulting in messy deaths, a pregnant policewoman (Frances McDormand) coming on the prowl and big mouthed hookers giving away vital information. <br/><br/>While the film could have gone the stereotypical comedy-chaos way with all the involved characters involved, it doesn't disappoint you. Writers-Directors Ethan Coen and Joel Coen stick to their guns. They slide the humour aside, though not neglecting it, while focusing entirely on development of the characters and the story. Fargo can be termed as a sitcom because most of the comedy is derived from the situations the characters, and especially Jerry, find themselves in. Jerry is absolutely inept at crime and is in no way prepared to deal with things as they begin snowballing out of hand. His absolute incompetence at controlling things is satirically proved by the fact that he can't ask the kidnappers to call off the job when things get awry since he doesn't have their phone numbers. <br/><br/>The film doesn't have a single protagonist, but the four important characters who share much of the screen time are all memorable, if not endearing. All the people involved are well-rounded, making them seem extremely close to real-life. Macy the Underrated is just splendid as the depressed and economically challenged Jerry. He isn't a bad guy, but is more simply a case of good guys resorting to unethical tactics due to desperation. A single scene where Jerry tries removing frozen ice from his car's windshield after a disappointing meeting illustrates the above mentioned fact; he isn't evil, just frustrated. Being a common man compelled to do wicked stuff, you pity him despite secretly laughing at his misery.<br/><br/>The two criminals are a study in contrast. Carl pretends to be the gregarious cool-guy who thinks he has everything in control, even if he knows things are going way out of hand. He does things that Gaear doesn't appreciate, like talk a lot, which makes him a classic case of the proverbial barking dogs seldom bite. Gaear is usually silent, but he proves to be the deadly when it comes to it. Despite being the brooding one, he makes many of the dangerous decisions that have to be made, like cold-bloodedly killing a cop followed by chasing down two kids who saw him kill the cop and shooting them too. A moment where their television doesn't work and their differing reactions perfectly highlights the stark difference between Carl and Gaear. The latter seems to be inspired from Sal in Dog Day Afternoon and it's only towards the end that you realize just how disturbed he is. <br/><br/>While the policewoman, Marge Gunderson, and her yet unborn baby barely look like a match for these demented men, she does have the benefit of intelligence on her side. Unlike the others, she doesn't believe in complicating things and with a clever combination of reason and deduction is able to take them on quite easily. Yet, the bulging belly doesn't give her the supercop feel, which makes her more life-like. Despite being the only woman in the midst of this chaos, McDormand carries her role of a faithful police-officer with ease, making you believe that you can trust her. She quite rightfully deserved the Academy Award for her neat performance. <br/><br/>It is the nonchalance and the simplicity of the movie that makes it such a real-life experience; a thing the movie even boasts of being. Even the details, like the conversational dialogues and the speaking accents are paid close attention to. The actors don't exceed the precincts of their roles, the drama is not overdone, the darkness isn't depressing and the comedy comes with the flow; giving a heart-warmingly authentic feel to Fargo. The film maintains a taut pace throughout, ending in a brilliant and bloody crescendo."
"mr_deadly","10","0","1","24 September 2011"," When Idiocy Leads to Tragedy
","I just re-watched Fargo after not having seen it for several years, and was extremely impressed. What I had recalled as a black comedy about a crime gone badly awry is in fact a tragic and gripping story about violence, with a humane law enforcement officer as the proxy for the audience. The parallels with No Country for Old Men are clear, reinforcing my view that while the Coens have a definite facility for comedy, they are at their best with drama.<br/><br/>Much of the confusion about the genre of this film stems from its setting in the rural upper Midwest. Many assume that the accents must surely be an over-broad conceit, an example of the Coens condescending to characters they consider their intellectual and aesthetic inferiors. This is quite incorrect--the Coens are setting their tale in a very specific setting, and the comedy stems from the distinctive mannerisms and speech of that setting. The descendants of Scandinavians who came to this region to farm and who continue to live in rural isolation really DO speak very much like the characters of Fargo. The ""ya sure, you betcha"" twang of Sarah Palin reflects the same influence: Wasilla, Alaska was mainly settled by the same descendants of rural Scandinavians that inhabit this film.<br/><br/>Fargo moves briskly--the opening scene sets into action the hare-brained scheme that will lead to all the tragic events to follow. William H. Macy's character, Lundegaard, is meeting two strangers to arrange for them to kidnap his own wife. Desperate for money--he's been embezzling from the GM dealership owned by his disdainful father-in-law where he is manager of sales--he's entrusting this dangerous scheme to two men he's never met. What follows is disastrous for all involved--the kidnappers, the woman abducted, an unlucky trooper making a traffic stop, two random motorists, Lundegaard, his father-in-law, a parking lot attendant.<br/><br/>The emotional center of the film is the pregnant chief of police of tiny Brainerd, Marge Gusfatson, and her husband. Beautifully played by Frances McDormand in an Oscar winning performance, Marge gamely investigates the trio of murders that occur shortly after the kidnapping and eventually, with a little luck and a great deal of pluck, solves the case. A consistent rock of good sense and kindness, Marge embodies the best aspects of her culture, in stark contrast to Lundegaard, who is nervous self-interest and foolishness personified, and even more stark contrast to the kidnappers, who embody violence and greed, all in pursuit of 'just a little bit of money.' <br/><br/>The script, acting, directing, cinematography, music, and sets of Fargo are all top-notch. This is film-making of the highest quality, the sparse landscape and wintry terrain perfectly reflecting the bleak reality of the consequences of violence. No Country for Old Men is in many ways a companion piece--the searing sun and bleak Texas landscape is just as forbidding as the snowy landscapes of Fargo, and both films accurately depict how greed can lead to dangerously bad decisions, which in turn can have deadly consequences for both participants and innocents. <br/><br/>Fargo is a tragedy, a modern American Shakespeare, where base motivations--greed for ""just a little bit of money""--can have vast unforeseen and evil ripple effects across entire communities."
"gigan-92","10","0","1","19 September 2011"," ""You should see the other guy""
","A+ <br/><br/>One film that everyone must surely see at some point in their life is ""Fargo"". Far from a loud action movie while retaining the aspects of a crime thriller, it is above anything a black comedy film. The storyline is based as many know on an actual murder case, and yet the writing has this irresistible off-beat comedic dialogue throughout. Most of the humor is unexpected, coming at times when you least think it. The Coen Brothers have an un-dismissible knack for story and character writing that shakes things up.<br/><br/>The incredible ensemble cast takes that screenplay and turns it into gold. William H. Macy is perfect as the quirky, shrewd schemer Jerry. The way he does it makes you feel sympathetic for his character at times, seeing as everyone just tosses him aside without a second thought. Peter Stormare spent most of the movie silent yet one could easily tell the character was a mad just because of that. Frances McDormand was pretty damn awesome as our main protagonist Marge, who maintains her composure no matter what she sees. With this film, it puts her on the list of great female roles, along the likes of bitch and Weaver. But even second to that, in my opinion, is Steve Buscemi, the ""funny looking"" guy. He's in such sharp contrast to his partner that it easily makes it one of the most memorable crime partnerships ever; even if for infamous reasons.<br/><br/>Going back to the story, it just twists and turns but you hardly notice it till near the climax. By then you realize the plan has fallen apart and that in effect all hell has broken loose. The photography by Roger Deakins also what help keeps the camera work subtle and you really are inclined to pay attention. Adding to all that is an awesome score by Carter Burwell that keeps the mood of the film constant. ""Fargo"" is an undeniable classic"

","Before last night, I had only seen certain parts of ""Fargo"", specifically the rather disturbing scene where Marge stumbles upon Gaear disposing of his late partner, Carl. I always thought that was pretty freakin' cool. But I never really had much motivation to watch the entire film... until last night. <br/><br/>Once I put the movie in, my eyes were glued to the TV. The movie is so well made, I might even go as far as to call it perfect! The setting was amazing. I really enjoyed the scenes with the white outs, especially, strangely enough, the opening credits. And not to mention the acting was impeccable. Frances did a near-perfect performance as the caring and just Marge. And Peter Storemare was really, really disturbing as Gaear. In general, though, this movie is perfect. I could go on and on how the plot was very clever, the writing was simply fantastic, and how it is probably my favorite American thriller yet. I recommend this film wholeheartedly to everyone who wants to see a creepy, stylish dark comedy about disaster in the mid-west, a man hiring kidnappers to kidnap his own wife, and a pregnant cop who is much more than your average police officer. TEN OUT OF TEN!"
"ScottAmundsen","10","0","1","31 August 2011"," The Coen Brothers' Crowning Achievement
","I am not enamored of all of the Coen brothers' oeuvre: RAISING ARIZONA was fun; THE HUDSUCKER PROXY left me cold; so did BARTON FINK. So I wasn't a huge fan. I was, however, fascinated with Frances McDormand (I forget where I first saw her) at the time when FARGO was released, so I went to see it mostly because of her.<br/><br/>When I left the theatre I was sure that McDormand was going to win the Oscar and that the picture would too (I turned out to be right about McDormand; the movie unaccountably lost to the major bore THE English PATIENT). For what I saw that evening was a true original: the best combination of tragic drama and uproarious comedy I have ever seen put on film.<br/><br/>We begin with Jerry Lundegaard (William H Macy in another of his truly great performances), a nervous, twitchy little man who works at his father-in-law's car dealership. His father-in-law (hissingly played by Harve Presnell) views him with a contempt he does not bother to conceal.<br/><br/>Jerry is in some sort of unspecified financial trouble, and an attempt to borrow money from ""Dad"" predictably fails, so he comes up with a bizarre plot to have his wife kidnapped to extort the ransom money from the old man.<br/><br/>Jerry enlists the help of a couple of ex-cons referred to him by yet another ex-con. Carl Showalter (Steve Buscemi) and Gaear Grimsrud (Peter Stormare), two of the most inept crooks in all of Minnesota, are the ""help"" enlisted by Jerry through his mechanic acquaintance Shep Proudfoot (Steven Reevis), who is himself an ex-con.<br/><br/>To be brief, things start to fall apart right from the get-go. Father-in-law unexpectedly agrees to the loan he had previously refused, so Jerry makes several abortive attempts to head off the kidnappers, but it is too late. The crime is afoot and Jerry's wife Jean (Kristin Rudrüd) has already been kidnapped. And in the process, the blundering kidnappers murder a pair of witnesses and a State Trooper.<br/><br/>Enter Police Chief Marge Gunderson (McDormand). When we first see her, she is asleep in bed beside her loving husband Norm (John Carroll Lynch), and is awakened by the telephone with news of the discovery of the bodies. As she sits up in bed, we see that she is hugely pregnant. Norm, a devoted spouse, won't let her leave without breakfast, which he cooks for her. Then she puts on her gear and waddles out to her patrol car, to find that the battery is dead (""Norm, prowler needs a jump!"") Indefatigable and determinedly cheery and polite, yet every inch a Chief of Police, Marge is at once the nice lady next door about to have her first baby and a formidable cop with great powers of observation and a sixth sense that kicks in just when she needs it.<br/><br/>I am not going to reveal any more of the plot. This movie is a true original. It is bloody, there is a lot of violence, the two kidnappers are as depraved as they are incompetent, and there is a lot of death. But there are also a LOT of laughs, especially if you happen to be of Scandinavian descent. I grew up with people who talked just like some of the people in this movie, and to hear that cadence again made me giggle like a schoolgirl even when the dialogue was deadly serious.<br/><br/>The entire cast is perfection, but at the end of the day this is McDormand's film, and she deservedly won the Oscar for it. Which is quite an accomplishment considering that, though Marge is the female lead, she does not appear until thirty-three minutes into the film.<br/><br/>This is one of those movies that is in a class by itself. Its greatness lies in the fact that you can't categorize it."

","Fargo is an all-out laugh fest with excellent performances and clever insights. There is plenty of violence, but there is also plenty of social commentary on Minnesota types.

Ultimately the blend of Minnesota Personalities and murder commentary, added with a moral value at the end to make it more morally correct add up to make a modern classic.

As the film progresses, it becomes more intense and intense.<br/><br/>Everyone did great in the acting department especially Frances McDormand, who won an Oscar for her role as Marge Gunderson, and William H.

They nailed the mannerisms, facial expressions, and especially the accent. I don't know if the accent is right in this film, but it certainly is interesting to hear and even funny at times.<br/><br/>As I said earlier, I enjoyed Fargo. I think it was a well made film. But there was really nothing special about it. Yes, everything was great; the script and direction by the Coen brothers and the acting. But nothing stood out. When the climax of the film kicked in, I was at the edge of my seat. I didn't want the pregnant police officer to die. I was really curious how the film is going to play out. But between that climax and the last scene, the film lost my interest somewhere somehow. It just gave me a MEH feeling as the credits start rolling. I was not disappointed at the film. I thought it was a well put together film. But it didn't really have an impact on me. I don't understand the point of this movie. Everything just seems DULL. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I think the screenplay by the Coen brothers is incredibly well written. They created one of the likable and memorable characters of all time including Marge Gunderseon and jerry Lundegaard. The film has a good story, climax, and a somewhat disappointed ending. The last 5-10 minutes or so just didn't do it for me. However, if the ending was improved, I doubt I would have liked it any better.<br/><br/>Maybe this is the type of film that grows on you. It might improve upon a second viewing. But as of now, the film is just MEH. I don't understand why people like this film so much and regard it as a masterpiece. Yes it's well acted, directed, and written. And that's about it. Nothing special. I didn't particularly love this movie and I still liked it. I enjoyed the story and the characters. I think it's a well crafted film that I hope will grow on me upon a second viewing."

","The Coen Brothers have brought us another story filled with blood and guts. ""Fargo"" is the story of a deal gone wrong involving cops, money, and an unexpected triple homicide. Now this movie is like a two-part plot involving two different stories, and both reaches together to make one full story. Joel Coen and Ethan Coen has created a script, that only they can write. They really know how to make the 'dark and bloody', and help hide it with some drama, and some comedy. Also, the well-provided cast of Frances McDormand, William H.

"ElMaruecan82","10","0","2","26 June 2011"," FARGO : Funny, Authentic, Rare, Great, Original ...
","""Fargo"" is one of these cinematic rarities for which the word 'original' has been invented. Never had a movie plunged me in such a unique atmosphere, and never will another film do. I respectfully salute one of the greatest cinematic creations, and I use the word 'creation' as this is one of a fistful of films that cannot be categorized. And this is the true cinematic accomplishment of ""Fargo"", while many acclaimed films relied on homage to other classics, the Coen brothers made a masterpiece out of nowhere, out of the middle of nowhere, only drawn from their memories, a vast territory unfairly snubbed by cinema, somewhere in Minesotta.<br/><br/>We're not in New York City, in Los Angeles, in the Death Valley, this is Paul Bunyan's territory, a flat region with a Siberian kind of winter that paints the landscape in such a blinding whiteness you can hardly see when the land stops and where the sky begins. It's a place that is unfamiliar, almost exotic to us, efficiently providing a memorable cinematic escapism. But the setting is not ""Fargo""'s only signature, the greatest strength of the masterpiece relies on the characterization, which comes part from the script, and part from the acting. In fact, when you keep the cinematography in mind, you realize that ""Fargo"" is one of these jewels where everything immediately penetrates your memories. That's why ""Fargo"" was rightfully regarded as a classic almost as soon as it was released.<br/><br/>The characterization is what gives ""Fargo"" its color, its touch of authenticity. It's a movie dedicated to the spine of America, lost between two coasts. The film made me wonder why this particular place has rarely been used in films and I guess part of the answer comes from the film itself. These are towns where politeness and simplicity are significant aspects of the culture, ""Minnesota Nice"" as they say. In the film, even the smallest characters welcome you with a shining smile compensating the sunless sky. They all are polite and hardly let a ""F' word slip from their tongue, even hostility is hidden behind politeness. This is the austere, simple but respectable culture of the habitants, mostly descendants from Scandinavian emigrants as it's implied by the consonance of their names, Lundergaard, Gustafson, Gunderson, Grimsrud, and that heavy accent, these ""Yeah"" that sound like ""Yah"". The accents are the music that accompanies the rhythm of the film in an odd but so appealing way. The limit between authenticity and caricature is very thin, but it works because the laughs are never aimed at people, but at the situations they're going through.<br/><br/>And speaking of situations, the setting is quite ironic as if it's specifically in these areas where violence is repressed, that it has to explode in the most vicious way. The movie is supposed to be based on a true story, but we all know it's more a kaleidoscope of the craziest and most memorable situations that impacted the Coen brothers, the debate is pointless anyway because the movie still invites us to contemplate one of the most pointless and tragic criminal affairs, initiated by Jerry Lundergaard, the Executives Sales Manager of a car company. William H. Macy portrays with perfection one of the biggest cinematic schmucks ever, a man so in need of money, he'll elaborate an incredibly stupid scheme by asking two criminals to kidnap his own wife, so he can get the money from his ruthless father-in-law. The two men are Carl Showalter and Gaear Grimsrud, played by Steve Buscemi and Peter Stomare, their relationship is driven by the ""talkative and stoic-guy-who- hardly-speaks"" classic but efficient dynamic. How these guys could work together is mystery, but they must have their reasons. Anyway, from the first minutes of the film, the mission is marked by the sign of incompetence. Whatever Lundergaard tries, he fails miserably, whatever he touches is doomed, yet he never gives up. The movie disturbingly oscillates between laughs and shocks, but both are used spontaneously: it never feels forced, and helps to assimilate the absurdity of what is happening.<br/><br/>But the movie could have never been praised with such enthusiasm had it focused the story on Lundergaard, Showalter or Stomare. The genius of the Coen brothers is the creation of Marge Gunderson, one of these impacting and memorable characters like only Cinema can provide. Her seven-month pregnancy gives a nice touch as it helps to root for a woman carrying life while investigating a horrific case of brutal murder, and makes so authentic and touching the famous moment where she feels nauseous, while watching corpses  just because of morning sickness. But she's not only a good and sweet woman, she's also very competent. She's the heart of the film, and her investigation is the Shakespearian journey into the world of simple people in their everyday lives with their flaws, their secrets, their kindness and sometimes their lies. Marge's sweetness probably relies on the perfect solidity of her marriage. She and her loving husband, Norm, exudes love and harmony that compensate the overall cynical tone of the film, a way of showing that these simple people, overly smiling, are authentic and admirable in their simplicity, and at least, they're happy the way they are. This austere simplicity is beautifully conveyed by the nostalgic and emotional score of the film that I immediately associate with this world of simple people, profoundly attached to their roots, and who have in their hearts the warmth lacking outside.<br/><br/>""Fargo"" is an original, inventive, beautifully written, film inhabited by a poetry that leaves you stunned at the end. And I'd like to thank Roger Ebert, as the one, who convinced me, from his ecstatic review to give the movie a second chance. I'm afraid to admit, that I didn't like ""Fargo"" in the beginning, but it takes one second viewing to get the genius of the film. You betcha!"
"Eternality","8","0","1","3 May 2011"," The genius of the Coens is their ability to fuse strong, uncompromising violence with moments of dark humor.
","There is a quick-glance subtitle at the start of Fargo that says the film is based on a true story. What a smart prank by the sneaky Coens. Never trust 'em brothers, for Fargo is a tale that borders on the near incredulous. Made in 1996 on a shoestring budget with a small cast of effective performers, Fargo is often considered by critics to be the quintessential Coen film – quirky, odd, violent and darkly amusing. Despite having their films financed by major distributors, the Coens have all these years remained a truly independent unit, always finding themselves a corner in the sandbox where they have full liberty to build their dream sandcastle. <br/><br/>I feel that Fargo is slightly overrated; heck it is not even as good as No Country For Old Men, their recent Oscar-winning triumph. However, Fargo has some of the best acting performances in a Coen film, especially from William H. Macy (Jerry) and Frances McDormand (Marge). Jerry and Marge are two characters that have personalities that are polar opposites of each other. Jerry is a fumbling, nervous, dim-witted salesman who has a huge money problem; on the other hand, Marge is a persevering, quick-thinking, and calm pregnant police chief who stumbles upon one of the strangest kidnapping-murder cases ever seen this side of Minnesota. <br/><br/>Despite the outstanding displays, the characters seem distant and we do not care whether they live or die. For once, the Coens focused too much on creating the perfect setting, the perfect story, thus neglecting the importance of giving emotional value to the characters they have written. These flaws of Fargo are somewhat covered by the same thing that covers the landscape of Minnesota - heavy snow. The cinematography by the legendary Roger Deakins is the most striking aspect of Fargo. Building frame after frame of long, composed takes of spreads of white, he manages to bring a sense of gloom to the mood of the film. <br/><br/>The genius of the Coens is their ability to fuse strong, uncompromising violence with moments of dark humor. We see that in No Country For Old Men, but it is in Fargo where they actually perfected this macabre formula. Fargo is good, but not great. It is the kind of film that will get better with repeated viewings. Well, ain't all Coen pictures? But for the originality of their screenplay, and their obsession to make the perfect police thriller, darn tootin', I will salute the Coens. <br/><br/>SCORE: B+ (8/10 or 3.5 stars)<br/><br/>www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com<br/><br/>All rights reserved."

","When i first saw Fargo a few years ago i wasn't as convinced , as most , of how good this film was. Since then , The Coen Brothers films have grown on me. After watching this again it has certainly gone up in my estimation although i still think it's far from perfect. Without a doubt , the best thing about Fargo is the characters . William H Macey , Steve Buscemi and especially Frances McDormand make Fargo the interesting film that it is. I love the way Marge Gunderson acts as if she's so slow , yet it's just the way people are in that part of the country and in fact she's far from stupid. William H Macey plays a man so caught up in debt that he tries to have he's wife kidnapped so he can share the ransom and needless to say things go wrong very quickly. He's perfect for the role of a man in trouble as he is in one of favourite films , Boogie Nights. This is not the best Coen Brothers movie but it certainly a memorable one and it's a film i appreciate a whole lot more than i did when i first saw it."

","Firstly, I'd like to weigh in with my thoughts on the Mike Yanagita scene. This is possibly my favourite scene in the whole movie (amongst several classic unforgettable scenes). It's funny enough when you first watch it, even though you find yourself feeling guilty about laughing. What IS funny about someone's wife dying from leukaemia exactly? The more you try and suppress your laughter, the harder you start to guffaw. I believe the Coen brothers wanted people to laugh guiltily at this poor chap breaking down.<br/><br/>It's even funnier when you realise later that Mike never in fact married the woman, she never died from leukaemia and the whole thing was some sort of creepy fantasy of his.<br/><br/>I don't really believe there is a deeper meaning behind this scene in terms of plot development or changing Marge's motivation, though I do accept it gets her scratching her head at how nice people can barefaced lie (or deceive themselves). I just think its a wacky piece of black humour, a set-piece slightly on a tangent but very very funny and therefore worthy of inclusion in the film. Does EVERYTHING in a movie have to be directly part of a linear plot line? Is there no room for random vignettes simply included to add to the atmosphere and entertainment value? <br/><br/>The quirkiness of the Yanagita scene leads me onto my next observation about ""Fargo"": Marge is the natural successor to my hero Lt Columbo (who I have reviewed several times on IMDb). When she first checks out the car wreck, in between barfing and drinking her coffee, Marge's style of deductive police work is pure Columbo. When she interrogates people, it's with the same ""dumb friendly"" schtick Columbo uses. Not that she's a one-dimensional copy of the Columbo character, far from it, just cut from the same cloth. Works for me!<br/><br/>Everyone in this film, every piece of dialogue, every snowy scene, every ""ya"" just works somehow. It would be much easier to analyse what's wrong with a movie than what's right, but in this case I find very little to criticise. The acting all round is stupendous. I actually rewatched ""Reservoir Dogs"" after this, so impressed with Steve Buscemi's acting that I wanted to see more of him. For the first time ever, I felt disappointed with ""Reservoir Dogs"", a film I normally love. Watching it back to back with ""Fargo"" revealed the superiority of the Coen brothers' movie to Tarantino's (still a great film don't get me wrong).<br/><br/>There are so many little touches that make this movie entertaining: the appalling muzak at the cafeteria; Carl's hilariously ill-at-ease facial expressions under the glare of the traffic cop's torchlight; Jerry ""co-operating"" with Marge, before getting carted out of his own house in his underwear, screaming like a baby; and all the peripheral but memorable, eccentric characters like the waitress at the diner, the escort girl at the Feliciano show with Carl and the ""pathetic piece of (whatever)"" parking attendant etc. Shep also plays his part excellently.<br/><br/>Just absolutely chock-full of great scenes, I actually watched Fargo three times yesterday and didn't get sick of it once. I feel like watching it again! And this is not because of hype or a feeling that I'm ""supposed"" to like this movie. I just do! I really feel it is something unique, not the most upfront, dramatic movie of all time, not a movie with a great profound message, just a lovable slice-of-Minnesotan life and some very entertaining winners and losers going about their business."
"DKosty123","8","0","1","19 November 2010"," Snowed out Crime of Insanity
","William H Macy and Frances McDormand's strong performances carry this film based upon a true incident. This is one of the movies which established Joel & Ethan Coen's reputation as film makers. While the whole crime idea by Jerry Lundgaard (Macy) is insane, the people he hires too kidnap his wife mess up everything. This goes to prove that no amount of money is worth everything.<br/><br/>There are a couple of flaws in the understanding of the plot. I really do not understand why Jerry (Macy) needs to score all that money. A scene that doesn't make sense is when Jerry arrives home to find his wife missing, he carries the groceries all the way to the second floor when the kitchen is one the first floor.<br/><br/>One more thing is I wonder if it is true that a character buries most of the $1 million in a open snow drift, if the money is still out there as there is no indication in the film that anyone has found it. Still the movie plays well & tell the whole story well. It is sort of a prelude to the later No Country For Old Men."

","This is one the most original movies of the 90s. The Coen Brothers do a excellent job in making this film.The acting is very clever. The plot is so original. I love how the story is so simple. It starts off as a simple non violent kidnapping that goes completely wrong. Jerry Lundegard works for a car dealership with his father in law and is an need of money for financial problems. So he hires two small time criminals to kidnapped his wife so his father in law can pay the ransom. Fargo is an excellent film and I highly recommend this movie to those that haven't seen it. It is filled with action.It is filled with suspense.It is also filled with some humor. Fargo is one of those types of movies that they don't make anymore. I give it a big thumbs up."
"murphy64","7","0","1","1 August 2010"," A drama filled with a of comedy..........
","In the movie Fargo, the character Jerry ends up in debt and set up a kidnapping of his wife, so that her father can pay a ransom. What he didn't expect was that the two kidnappers Carl and Gaear were going to kill a several people. The theme of the movie I would say is that a crime gone badly. The kidnap was supposed to be the clean cut and no one was supposed to be hurt. By the end of the film people were killed and no one ended up with the ransom money as planned. The kidnap was a disaster from the beginning, when Carl and Gaear met up with Jerry he showed up late at the bar and they were upset. Then when they went to kidnap Jean, she ended up knocking herself out by getting wrapped in a shower curtain and falling down the stairs. After that it goes from bad to worse, they have to kill a highway patrol and an innocent person who just happen to be riding by. The movie was filled with drama but also comical, because of some of the events that took place. Like Jean getting wrapped in the shower curtain, the investigating sheriff Marge being pregnant and also Marge's voice seem so high pitch and nonchalant. Another comical scene was when she met her friend Mike in the restaurant for lunch, that scene was funny to me but I didn't understand how it related to the film at all. The lighting in the film was very mild; although it was winter and there was white snow outside it was still a cloud look throughout the film. There weren't any bright moments in the film they were always a dim look in the scenes. The light wasn't bright most like to make the plot of the crime look more interesting and unexcited. I think if there would have been bright lighting in the film it would have gave the audience the same effect as with the dim lighting."
"tbills2","10","0","3","13 July 2010"," Fargo's in a class of its own.
","Fargo is truly awesome. It's like a light-hearted, whimsical, deeply dark and disturbing comedy-drama, or something like that. It's in a class all of its own is what I mean. There is no movie that's like it. It's really amusing and disturbing at the same time. And it's completely fascinating. And it's absolute quality film making. The Coen Brothers really put their touch on the film. I feel William H. Macy is the best part of this movie. His character is genius. And Macy really gave an awesome performance. McDormand and the 2 thugs are a close second. The cast really shines. Fargo is a true gem. It has depth, details, all the good movie making qualities you need. I feel this is one of the most powerful movies ever made. You almost have to be in the right mood to watch Fargo, because it is so dark, but if you are, it will be one of the best movies you'll ever see. I think this is a bonified, consensus classic that will stand any test of time. Fargo is so precious, just because it's so completely different from any other film. Words are unable to describe, just go watch it for yourself! Worthy of a perfect score, 10 of 10."
"carcar-759-676336","6","0","1","7 June 2010"," It could have been more
","I will start out and say that I don't like that at the beginning you get this impression that the story is true (I didn't get the privilege of knowing otherwise before watching it) only to find out that, well it's fiction stringed together from a few events, but fiction made from inspiration, nevertheless. I admit that boiled me a bit. I think they could have gone about it a different way other than being so misleading, but I'm sure if they re-did this film they might agree they could have done that better.<br/><br/>Now, about the film. I feel knowing that it's not more non-fiction that it ruins it a bit. I was left gullible before knowing that thinking ""Wow, this is so unbelievable that this happened...wow...really?"" So, when I look back at it knowing that's not true, well I feel like the gore is now unnecessary. If it happened it adds astonishment that such a crime was committed, but... if it's somewhat improved from events the astonishment of that is gone. You're left with some excessive gore.<br/><br/>The acting was marvelous, but it meandered a bit in the beginning. A bit overrated, but not a bad film."
"jzappa","10","0","1","30 May 2010"," Heck Ya Mean?!
","Fargo opens with the message that it is ""based on a true story,"" and closes with a retraction that its ""persons and events"" are fictional. ""True story"" is a joshing dramatic contraption, obliquely causing us to accept certain elements we might not normally accept so easily. Regardless, Fargo is concordant with the intonations and distinctions of modern small-town life. When Chief Marge Gunderson stands at the first crime scene and counts three dead bodies, she accurately recognizes that the culprits are not from Brainerd. Endeavoring into the city on her inquest, she asks a friend for a tip on a good place to eat, and is guided to the Radisson buffet. Jerry Lundegaard is as boxed in by his sales manager's job and his cruel father-in-law as any inmate in a jail cell. He's shuffling a stolen car and a double fraud. His son hurtles off from the dinner table to meet his friends at McDonald's. His wife toils manically at every domestic chore, chopping, stirring and knitting with as much rapidity as she's capable of. Against these homegrown nuances, the crimes protrude as brutal and barbaric. There are unpleasant parts. Everyone recalls the scene with the wood-chipper. More cold-blooded is the scene where the poor hostage, blindfolded and barefoot, attempts to escape on foot in the snow, and Carl Showalter makes fun of her. There are also the shootings, callous and abrupt. Against this Chief Marge, seven months pregnant, applies cozy small-town buoyancy as a way of ferreting privileged info out of crooks.<br/><br/>Our introduction to Marge comes far into this atmospheric and genre-less film. The crime aspects are at this point engaged. We've met Jerry, the auto sales executive with a ridiculous scheme. We've met Carl and his laconic, merciless accomplice, both memorably played by Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare, who have settled for it. These are eccentric, off-kilter, incomparable characters, yet when things lose control and Marge and her husband Norm are presented is when the movie unearths its heart. Marge Gunderson is one of a sprinkling of characters whose names always abide in our recollections, like Travis Bickle, HAL 9000, Walter White. They are totally, daringly themselves in stories that rely upon exactly who they are. Lacking all the fetishistic glamour of other Hollywood policewomen, Marge is the chief in Brainerd, Minn., continues to have periods of morning sickness, inhales all the processed, frozen, prepackaged, canned food she can get her hands on, speaks in a Minnesota dialect where ""yeah,"" pronounced ""ya,"" is showered like a motto. She's a born cop, really sharp. Although one might find the lack of response by the State Police to the murder of one of their own highly questionable, at the crime scene local police chief Marge nevertheless promptly and efficiently deduces what occurred, and discerns there were two killers, one big, one small. Her partner, not so nimble, doesn't catch on that ""DLR"" signifies a dealer plate: ""I'm not sure I agree with you a hundred percent on your police work there, Lou."" There is a scene some people seem to think baffling between Marge's first and second interviews with Jerry, when she has dinner with a high school classmate Mike Yanagita. It's a disquieting hiatus that, when it comes to motif---a forlorn guy lying hysterically, failing to mask his anxiety---weighs in as pivotal. Mike functions as an echo of Jerry, and the dinner scene works like the connector between Marge's first and second interviews with him. The next morning, she is about to revisit Brainerd when a high school girlfriend tells her that everything Mike said was a lie. That's the alarm bell that compels her back to Jerry, and is somehow superior to the recourse, a single interview with Jerry that just swelters him out.<br/><br/>William H. Macy's performance is a cave-in of dread and agitation. Here is a man who just wants one thing: a $750,000 loan from his affluent father-in-law, so he can purchase parking lots and make some of his own money. His office's vertical blinds are used visually like prison bars. If he can steal the money, he can buy the lots. Yes, his wife will have to be abducted, but he'll have to be big about that. He knows nothing about the kidnappers, and lawyers are hounding him all day for data that would reveal the missing car. And there's Marge, sitting across his desk, bright and sprightly, asking him questions he cannot answer. Macy wilts, his smirking grin a cringe, his restraint like a nerve clasp, and things cram him further in.<br/><br/>The snow and cold endow the Coens with cinematic reference marks and an inescapable feeling of location. The opening shot fades in to Jerry's desolate venture to transfer the car with a haunting folksy Carter Burwell score. High-angle shots reveal two frosted parking lots, which the Buscemi character curiously decides to boost license plates and make a ransom exchange. When Jerry struggles to satisfy a discontented client, the goofy man and his wife have their goose-down coats amusingly heaped in their laps. The frost and gloom oppress everything, and in the middle, in their snug envelope, are Chief Marge and Norm. The Coens have been said to gibe their characters, but their affinity for Marge generates the healing power of Fargo. Marge is the spark plug, alleviating grief and mending law and order. As a result, this might be the warmest film the brothers have so far made, and no less exceedingly ripe and uniquely engrossing than their other works."

","Acting in this movie was almost mocking the Minnesota accent at first but at the end of the movie, you realize the simplicity of their lifestyle is critical to the impact of the story. It adds drama and creates a more violent story line. There was symbolism in the life of the police woman versus her job. she seemed able to to separate her personal emotions from the crime and bloodshed, however in the end we see that it does finally effect her. This movie also shows how things in life cannot be planned and life has a way of not following the original path one sets out. I think this movie was trying to emphasize that life is short and unpredictable and we have to make the most of the simple pleasures and people in our lives."
"rps-2","5","0","2","29 April 2010"," Odd movie
","I'd given it a 7 rating and then read that it is not based on a true story, as stated in the opening credits. So I bumped it down to 5. This sort of sham/scam was common in the eighties and nineties but it is unforgivable! A breach of the vital trust between moviemaker and movie watcher. It's an odd sort of movie combining gruesome brutality with quirky comedy. It's an original dramatic device. The bad guys are so bad that you need a little relief. And that's provided by the pert, perky (and pregnant) cop. There also are some very loose ends. What, for example, was the point of bringing in the Japanese ex-boyfriend? It didn't seem to have any link whatsoever to the plot. It also overflows with plugs and product placements. However despite these shortcomings, it is still a pretty good nailbiter."

","In many ways I find this the most satisfying of all Coen Brothers movies I have seen (nine out of sixteen) and mostly the later ones. I enjoyed 'spotting' characters based on Clifford Odets, William Faulkner and Faulkner's long-time Hollywood mistress in Barton Fink but that was only one aspect of a movie that failed to grip me in total. In the case of Fargo it's difficult to identify any negative aspects in a movie that works on so many levels, black comedy, thriller, love story celebrating married love (think William Powell/Myrna Loy without the martinis and wise-cracks)tragedy. Although William H. Macey and Frances MacDormand have rightly been singled out for high praise - which their subsequent work has fully justified - the entire cast work brilliantly as an ensemble.

","The Coens blend their dark comedy routine into this murder story and create an instant classic. The shock and awe of one particular scene is lost on me because I saw this film years after it's release and knew about it before hand. Yet it still had an impact on me.<br/><br/>Steve Buscemi is perfect as the 'funny looking fella' who never shuts up (which is why he is constantly told to shut up by Walter in The Big Lebowski) and the counterpart of Peter Stomare is chilling. When the kidnap the wife, it works in both comedy and terror.<br/><br/>William H. Macy plays the loser who comes up with this so called brilliant plan, but it never goes his way. People say when you write a script, you throw your character in a tree and while up there throw rocks at him. At the end you let him down, but with Fargo, Macy stays up there. He takes a beating in this film and nothing works out for him.<br/><br/>The script is written with a sense of irony. It is a serious crime drama and the Coen's sprinkle of comedy throughout. The film is brilliant in a way. Specifically when we see Buscemi walk up the backyard steps of the house he's about to break into while the wife just sits there watching him speechless. It's not until he literally breaks the glass that she screams and runs away. Funny and entertaining stuff, it works so well in this film.<br/><br/>I'm upset I didn't see this one sooner then I did and that I wasn't a fan the first time around.

"johnnyboyz","10","0","1","7 January 2009"," Still to be topped by the Coens, or really by anyone else for that matter.
","I still think Fargo is the Coen brothers' crown and glory, even after seeing some of their more popular films such as The Big Lebowski and Millers Crossing; not to mention recent best picture winner No Country for Old Men. Such a film can be revisited and enjoyed every now and then, delivering a powerful experience revolving around some pretty desperate characters in a location ice cold and seemingly cut off from the rest of the world.<br/><br/>One of the many reasons I frequently revisit Fargo is its attention to detail and the manner in which it comes across as an art film. There is so much going on both on and below the surface in the film and yet it doesn't need to bash you over the head with vast visuals in order to tell you this. On the surface, Fargo is a very quaint and slow burning crime drama revolving around an organised kidnapping and a ransom deal that goes awry. The film is one of few that I suppose comes to near perfection, in most every aspect of film-making. The cinematography, the screenplay, the intensity of some characters and the quirkiness of others, the attention to each character as an individual different to everyone else and the tiny things like the attention to sound that compliments the visuals.<br/><br/>I said the location was cold and felt cut off from the rest of the world. In essence, most of the characters are like this. They are self obsessed and do not stop to think about others until it is too late, the incidence that demonstrates this is when events instigator Jerry Lundegaard (Macy) sits in his house's hallway and contemplates how everything got to the level of awfulness it's now at in the film. Other characters are victims; others are phoney aggressors that mutate into real aggressors and others are innocents tragically caught up in the middle.<br/><br/>The film is about pregnant police chief Marge Gunderson (McDormand) as she attempts to piece together what happened following the shooting of a state trooper after he pulled over a car. This event is connected to the arranged kidnapping of Jean Lundegaard (Rudrüd) by her husband Jerry so that he can quench his thirst for greed and automatically inherit a lot of money from his super-rich father in law. The shooting of the trooper is a significant event; it sparks a change in both genre and focus, shifting the perspective from Jerry and his criminal buddies to Marge and her quest to just figure things out for herself. The film carries its crime related establishment over into a detective strand, but maintains enough of a focus on both to deliver a riveting and harrowing tale.<br/><br/>The film begins with Jerry meeting both Carl Showalter (Buscemi) and Gaear Grimsrud (Stormare) at a bar, again in the middle of nowhere. He lends them a car and gives them the heads up on the plan; he is also very late for his appointment which could be seen as a pre-cursor to the string of badly timed and miss-matched events that follow. It is one man's desperation and greed that signals the chaos and Jerry is that man. ""It was a mix up, I guess"" says Jerry; one of many more to come.<br/><br/>It's easy to just sit and watch in awe when viewing Fargo, even on a repeated viewing. The Coens pay specific attention to the crime genre but also to comedy, black comedy, best seen when Jean is in the process of being kidnapped and panics amidst the shower curtain before falling down the stairs and knocking herself out. Additionally, upon arriving at the log cabin, she panics some more and rushes around whilst bound and blind thus falling over a log and hurting herself again. It is the bizarre image of someone trapped in a shower curtain and running around in the snow with a sack on their head juxtaposed with the situation that is the kidnapping and the two kidnapper's reactions to these events.<br/><br/>But additionally to this, the Coen brothers pay specific attention to realism. When at the night club bar, Carl tries to get the attention of a waiter who cannot hear him and walks off and it's these tiny, tiny focuses on the unnecessary that just push the film into a boundary of the brilliant, you're convinced these people may be real in real places doing real things. But to see the film is also to hear it. Witness the snow falling gently or the wind blowing minutely; the use of the television show playing as one kidnapper makes their way up the side of the house much to Jean's surprise and horror. It is the attention to sound as well as the visual that truly packs the punch which hits home with Fargo, a juxtaposition of sound and imagery as we feel the same emotions of surprise and fear etched on a character's face.<br/><br/>I am pleased the Coen brothers have had the success they've recently been through as when they keep within in the realm of the crime or gangster genre, things usually go very well. Their branching off into comedy rarely works for me, but seems to give many others a kick so that's all well and good. But if they ever do match Fargo, and they have come close, then the spectacle will truly be one to witness."

I truly believe that they filmed this movie in the upper Mid-West. My favorite line is when Chief Gunderson has the murderer in the back of her patrol car, and she tries to talk to him.

Some things i did like tho, was how everyone said Ya, at first i thought what a bunch of hicks, but soon it began to amuse me. I enjoyed how the characters talked to each other as neighbors do to one another, that made this movie seem more like the real world than some of the fake dialog i witness in other movies.<br/><br/>All in all, i give this movie a 5 or 6, not a piece of art like some claim, but not a piece of trash like others have suggested.<br/><br/>Its an OK movie!!!"

","Fargo is inevitably a ruined film. The directing, story and screenplay.

I know the Coen brothers didn't make O brother where art Now before Fargo, but just goes to show that a good choice of actor/actresses can carry a film regardless of other elements e.g. story, directing e.t.c<br/><br/>To me, this is is not a classic as others are saying but a missed chance of greatness that sadly thrives for excellence but just cant reach.

","To kidnap someone and get a ransom is not an easy thing and it takes professionals to do it clean and neat. An amateur crime entrepreneur needs money for some economic venture. He wants it from his father in law who will naturally refuse to give it. So that dear amateur contacts two hooligans who accept to kidnap the amateur's wife, the very daughter of the rich father in law, to get the money as a ransom. Since the man is a car dealer, they want a brand new car and thereafter everything will go wrong. On the way back from the kidnapping with the abducted woman in the back the two hooligans are stopped because they had not registered the car that had a Dealer plate. They kill the state trooper. Two witnesses come by. They are chased and killed. Then the car that was given away has a problem with its registration at the bank or some accounting firm because its serial number is not legible on some listing of sold cars. The father in law decides to deliver the money and he ends up dead, plus a parking lot warden dies too. In the mean time one of the two kidnappers who was taking care of the woman kills her because she is whimpering, and he kills his accomplice when he arrives without the money he has buried in the snow along some cattle fencing, which causes his being killed and then put through a wood-chipper by the first kidnapper. At this moment the pregnant female sheriff from Brainerd who has been investigating the death of the state trooper in the Twin Cities arrives and arrest one kidnapper. During that time the entrepreneurial car dealer is trying to cool it off when the police comes for him. He will end up arrested too. The best Jewish thriller ever produced. When everything turns wrong. The Coen Brothers are perfect witnesses for these flunkies drop-out failing losers who are loose in their brains and disjointed in everything else. It is the Biblical Job but without any divine dimension, without the excuse of being victimized or tested by God. Just one mishap on top of another and the impossibility to stop the sinking process. And the Coen Brothers by just over-highlighting the negative events transform a pathetic character and a pathetic situation into a real funny one, not funny to the point of laughing your heads off, but funny to the point of thinking ""God bless me and thanks I am not like these idiots."" A classic of sorts of the Jewish humor we like.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID"

","This is a film many people think a lot about and try to read messages from in one way or another, when it seems it was just a nice film Coen wanted to make, end of story.<br/><br/>I liked the most of it: the woods, the winter, and with a pregnant cop(!) as the main character. Since I'm from Sweden, it was kind of cool picking up the Americanized Swedish names - Gustafson, Lundegaard and a couple of more - it gave the film a more specific, unique and not very often used location and background which was really nice.<br/><br/>There were not so good points however. I found the dialects too thick (they might talk like that in that are, I have no idea), the character development too shallow and the worst, too many loose strings and oddities thrown in. An Asian guy makes an appearance from nowhere, doesn't contribute and then disappears. The fate of a kid is never resolved, and so on.<br/><br/>However, the thing that really lifts the film are the actors, mainly Buscemi in his best role ever. William Macy is great too and Frances McDormand do well, if not great. Stormare has the weakest part, mainly because his character is almost mute. Not easy to work under such conditions.<br/><br/>So in short, I'd say this is well worth seeing after all. See it not as a Hollywood but as a well done school project."

"ed_zeppelin","8","0","1","28 August 2007"," Very nearly a darn toot'n' classic...but not quite
","Tarantino without the fractured narrative. Fargo is the kind of film that people call ""quirky"", which is ironic in the light of its opening claim to being a true story  I had my suspicions the instant it said that the events were portrayed exactly as they happened, a tall order for any film. While I think it's flawed in places, it's still an extraordinary peep into an enclosed environment; while some films like to point out small-town suburbia as a front for some seriously freaky goings on, the great strength of Fargo is that it undermines that sense of juxtaposition; it deals with life in a sleepy town and an investigation into a series of brutal murders without really presenting any major difference between them.<br/><br/>In many thrillers setting is used to box the story in, to provide clear boundaries that provide the characters with their definitions and beyond which they cannot pass. A lot of film noir is an example of this. With the white snowdrifts of a Midwestern winter though, Fargo appears to take place in a void: it has no need of boundaries since there is nothing for it to mark, no sense of a place where here stops being here and becomes there. In some indoor shots the outside world is literally featureless, as if the entire film takes place inside a giant ping pong ball. This sense of blankness is far more isolating than any found in the kind of crime film that romanticises the idea of Mexico as a criminal's escape route, turning it into an Eden-like haven.<br/><br/>The atmosphere of the film comes from the sense that every character in the film feels like they belong precisely there: they are so much an intrinsic part of their setting, unlike the usual stereotype of bringing in the hero from outside so that they can in effect become the audience, pointing out the place's oddities from an external perspective. Fargo gives the viewer credit for noticing this for themselves, without really having to actively reinforce the sense of place and culture. Characters are allowed to be people first and narrative devices second: they sit around repeating themselves and stating the obvious, while the camera impassively lingers on shots to record them shuffle around doing whatever it is that they do. The best illustration of the film's dynamic is its leading lady, the very ordinary Marge Gunderson (a fantastic performance by Frances McDormand), who slips between her homely personal life and her gruesome professional responsibilities so smoothly that there ceases to be any delineation between the two. Her character's slow, pregnant waddle becomes her greatest asset: she is someone so unbelievably good at her job that she has no need to actually look the part and hit all the usual marks. Hers is not a role that calls for an Ellen Ripley, and this justifies the film's endless  and endlessly charming  digressions here there and everywhere, which never feel like they're disrupting the plot.<br/><br/>Perhaps it's no surprise then that the lease convincing characters are the out-of-towners, the two thugs (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) hired to kidnap a housewife (Kristin Rudrüd) so that her husband (William H. Macy) can collect a fortune in ransom money from her rich father (Harve Presnell). Carl (Buscemi) shows up the film's Tarantino influence most strongly, with his rambling monologues deliberately about nothing. However, this has a tendency to compromise the film's sense of authenticity since his dialogue is nowhere near as natural as Tarantino's; this is screen writing taken to the opposite extreme, with a character casting about for topics of conversation for little reason other than for the sake of not talking about the plot. Far more interesting is Stormare's near mute, Gaear. Carl is the brains of the pair; Gaear is not the brawn, but the will. He is the one who takes matters into his own hands to resolve a problem, but his motivations lie far deeper. While Buscemi's snippy crook is motivated fairly unambiguously by money, Gaear seems indifferent to it. He kills out of necessity, convenience, sometimes just pure whim, while other times it is genuinely impossible to imagine his reasons, making Marge's final words to him  not understanding how he can kill people just for money  all the more resonant.<br/><br/>For all its charm and comedy, Fargo is a sometimes distressing film. Innocent people get killed or bereaved, and they evoke sympathy because of their relentless likability. Even Jerry (Macy) still feels like a nice guy in the face of his vile and cowardly crime, because he's so helpless and pathetic. The brutal violence is shocking in Fargo not because of its nature but because these are real characters getting killed rather than nameless meat-puppets who exist merely to provide action scenes to titillate the audience. If only the film had tighter characterisation of its lead villain, we could be looking at a classic: with that slightly weak link in place though, Fargo is merely very good."

The plot became boring, uninteresting and daft and all suspense went gone! The actors were quite good, the music could have been more diversified.

The order by which the character's are introduced are quite odd, where the first 1/3rd of the film is about Jerry Lundegaard (Macy) and his wife's set-up kidnap by Carl (Buscemi) and Gaear (Stormare). The last 2/3rds are about Marge Gunderson (McDormand), a police officer, trying to solve three murders in the process of kidnapping Jerry's wife. The whole film I was glued to the screen, and when it ended, I kind of went ""Oh."" It's not a tricky film to follow, it doesn't have any interesting plot twists or any amazing ending, it's just a wonderfully written, directed and acted simple film, that instead of ending with a big bang shoot 'em up, ends with more of a simple and effective whimper.<br/><br/>My rating: **** out of ****. 93 mins.

It then leads to the con-men going to Brainerd Minnesota after they kidnap her and a local cop (Frances McDormand) tries to investigate (after she is murdered) the murders of Macy's wife and other people. There are no complaints I have about this film. It has a little too much violence and profanity but oh well. I love McDormand's brilliant Minnesotan accent! She definitely deserved an Oscar.

","""Fargo"" has another character - that North Midwestern accent, with its Scandinavian lilt, its folksy charm and its disarming presence in practically every scene in the movie. This film is a hoot! I agree completely with Ebert's beautiful review. It is fascinating, heartfelt, true to character, place and situation, extremely funny, and sometimes painfully violent. I would only add that as an entertainment, it is one of the most disorienting experiences a viewer can find in the cinema. It is fascinating to watch this film back-to-back with the Coen Brothers' ""Blood Simple"", a great film in its own right, but which seems like the preparation for their masterpiece, ""Fargo"". The tension is almost unrelieved in ""Blood Simple"". But the ending violence is so over-the-top, that the viewer suddenly realizes that they are really being sneakily had by the filmmakers and that the joke is on them. In ""Fargo"", the tension is also unrelieved. But here the film starts with the audience being ""in"" on the outrageousness of the events and the almost cartoon-like characters with their outrageous accents. But still we don't know sometimes whether to laugh or feel chilled (with the events AND that bleak Minnesota winter!) <br/><br/>The audience experiences two strands of tension - the crime, and Jerry Lundegaard's exponentially growing nightmare. Who doesn't identify with the moment when in total exasperation at the unfolding of events, Jerry has that tantrum, trashing his desk. Granted we haven't all had our spouses kidnapped for money! But we are right there with Jerry, feeling his helplessness. What a tour-de-force of acting from William H. Macy, with France McDormand's human-wise Marge, and Steven Buscemi's SadSack crook creating and leading one of the greatest acting ensembles to grace an American film in years. The audience thinks from the very beginning, that that bizarre Steven Buscemi sure seems ""funny-lookin"" in this movie. And when that phrase is uttered in two of the funniest moments of the film, we in the audience laugh, knowing the film-makers are actually making fun of us at these priceless moments. We may be ""in"" on the jokes, but the film-maker""s are absolutely onto us - and they have fun in letting us know that. Frances McDormand's Marge, with her genuine, caring persona, a smile that lights up the screen, and the most-musical of accents - absolutely nailing the rhythms and cadences of that beautifully distinctive speech (little-known outside that part of the United States until this film came along) is a revelation in this movie. It makes the audience want to see any film she has ever been in before!<br/><br/>This is a movie that became an instant classic, plunging the viewer into an alternate universe of feelings, situations and characters that they identify with, are repulsed by, laugh at, and ultimately embrace. You betcha!!!"

","Set against the white canvas, Fargo is one of those rare films that comes along once in a decade. Arguabley the best film of the nineties, this gem gets better with repeated viewing like most Cohen brothers films pre Ladykillers. The acting is superb, the cast perfectly picked. Some defining roles in the careers of Steve Buschemi, Peter Stormaire and William H. Macy.<br/><br/>The serpentine plot is just one of the outstanding facets of this film, the cinematography set against the white canvas of the Minnesotta winter, creates a lonely, sad, isolated feeling. Isolation in general is a major theme in this film, as well as the distances between people, the lack of communication, lies and deception that can be humanity at its worst. In fact very few people in this film are not total degenerates. The Cohen brothers are clearly expressing our existential despair through black humor and they do it like no one else when they have all cylinders firing as they do in Blood Simple, Raising Arizona, The Big Lebowski, Barton Fink, and Millers Crossing."

","It's funny how the simple word ""Yaaah"" sounds so dimwitted in the movie, yet turns out to be one of the few affirmations of normalcy in a maelstrom of frenzied lunacy. ""Fargo"" is the quintessential film of how a bad idea can only get badder (worse?) when put in the hands of inept bunglers who can just about taste a big payday. What happens to them is a sort of poetic justice, but there's nothing as lyrical or pretty as poetry going on here.<br/><br/>Here's a movie where you can't picture any of the principals being portrayed by anyone else. It's the perfect meld of characters, dialog and situations that domino from one disaster to another with eerie precision, and the unsettling feeling that yes indeed, as nuts as it all is, this is something that could actually happen.<br/><br/>For whatever reason, I haven't seen a lot of the Coen Brothers pictures. I came across ""The Big Lebowski"" a couple of weeks ago, and decided to catch this film today to keep the streak going. I'm suitably impressed by their quirky characters and bizarre, colorful plots to keep on going. Bitingly original, they leave one somewhat disturbed, but curious for more.<br/><br/>Frances McDormand, William H. Macy and Steve Buscemi are stand out in their roles here, but except for a few brief minutes shared by Macy with each of them, their characters never really appear together. Chalk it up again to the story tellers who move things along in spite of the hapless Jerry Lundegaard, someone we can all relate to whenever things we can clearly see in our head just don't quite turn out the way they're planned. Poor Jerry, he never even came close; kind of makes you wonder how he ever became the executive sales manager.<br/><br/>Say, I wonder if Gaear (Peter Stormare) got his inspiration from Paul Bunyan?"

The plot is pretty simple and goes something like this: A man wants money, so he hires two people to kidnap his wife so her rich husband can pay the ransom. That's pretty much it. Of course, nothing goes right and people end up getting killed, beat up, axed, whipped, and chopped into tiny bits.<br/><br/>Apart from the original concept, this film actually has mostly everything else working in it's favor. The writing it funny, directing is pretty laid-back, but gets the job done without looking dull or too stylistic, and the acting is mostly good. Only thing that bothers me is Frances MacDormand actually winning an Acadmey Award for her role. How that ever happened is truly a mystery, not to mention the first thing people should consider when contemplating the credibility of the Oscars.<br/><br/>I have absolutely no trouble saying that this is, without a doubt, the Coen's best film...by far.

What really bugged me was the ending because it didn't tell a lot. Also,What happened to the briefcase that was buried in the snow. Who found it? was it found? I would have much rather preferred to know some of the blanks they left us, but on the other hand some of the best movies are the best movies because of endings like that. last I think that people who think this movie is garbage are garbage, it obviously is a great movie regardless of your opinion, IMDb 92?

"PolishBear","9","0","1","29 January 2005"," It's a true story! Just ask Mike Yanagita.
","The titles at the beginning of ""Fargo"" indicate that the film is based on a real murder case. The clue to whether this is true or not, I think, comes during Marge Gunderson's lunch with Mike Yanagita, a guy who attended the same high school as Margie. Mike's tale is woeful indeed ... but as we learn later, it's all an elaborate ruse. The same can be said for ""Fargo,"" but who cares? This is one movie I can watch over and over and NEVER get tired of. I found the ""Special Edition"" DVD at my local grocery store for just $10 and wondered, ""Is this DVD so cheap because so few people want to take a chance on this movie?""

","I haven't seen too many of the Coen brothers' films, in fact, the only ones I've seen apart from this one are Intolerable Cruelty and The Man Who Wasn't There. This one didn't hold my attention like The Man Who Wasn't There and it didn't make me laugh as often as Intolerable Cruelty. It was quite funny at some points, no doubt about that, and often it was far more funny than most other comedies... but too many of the jokes seemed to be repeated over and over. The pregnant lady eating, the locals saying 'yah', William H. Macy's character stuttering or throwing a fit... I don't know, it seemed like the Coen's couldn't think of enough good jokes, so they just repeated those they had over and over. Some of the jokes are insanely funny, though. Most of these come from Steve Buscemi. Just about every scene he's in, he steals the show. When he's not on screen, you're usually somewhat bored. One thing I also found myself getting a bit annoyed over the things left unresolved, and the scenes that seemed pointless. There were several characters in the film that could easily have been written out with no change to the overall product, apart from making it move faster. The plot is good, original and full of clever twists. The pacing is somewhat good, but too much of the film is boring. Like I said, Buscemi saves every scene he's in, but it's often boring in scenes not involving him. The acting is good, for the most part. Frances McDormand gives a great performance. The rest of the leads are all credible. The characters are well-written and credible. The humor is good, and at times great. A pretty good Coen brothers' film that could have been better. Too slow-moving and repetitive for my tastes, but definitely worth a watch, especially for fans of Steve Buscemi. I recommend it to fans of the Coen's, Steve Buscemi and the other principal actors. 8/10"

Gunfire is inevitable however the deceased were given dignity and bloodshed was very minimal.

If you expect to much from a film then some of the things could hardly impress you but this film defenintly did not move me at all.

","The Coen Brothers are without doubt well known for their peculiar films but this is the first which has had more hype about it than any other.  Fargo has a story as straight as they come.  One kidnapped lady, Two Kidnappers, one desperate man and a policewomen with time on her hands.   That's what you get with Fargo.    Taking it's set in a town where it never seems to stop snowing it hasn't got a claustrophobic feel to it like I would have hoped.  I honestly didn't think much of the film.  The acting was spot on as was the dialogue but it didn't take me back.  I can watch Fargo without flittering an eyelid and enjoy it all the same but I don't enjoy for the reasons I should.  The story was good but I have a feeling it's the kind of narrative I have spotted before in a film and had nothing new to offer. <br/><br/>
This isn't The Coen Brothers best work, that title goes to Miller's Crossing, The Big Lebowski and The Man Who Wasn't There which are much better films with much better stories but Fargo got all the more praise when it really shouldn't have.  Still this is not the worst film ever, it's just not the best which is what I was lead to believe from the hype but it still makes interesting viewing and has it's moments but I would encourage people to watch other Coen Brothers films instead of this as I don't think you'll be getting what you are looking for."

"Basketcase247","10","0","1","13 August 2003"," Greatest movie of the 90s
","Warning:May contain spoilers.<br/><br/>Very closely followed by Pulp Fiction, Fargo is definitely the best film of the 90s. It is the perfect mixture of comedy, drama, violence, suspence, great acting, and even greater dialogue.<br/><br/>The story revolves around a middle-aged car salesman(William H. Macy) who makes a deal with two thugs(Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare), to kidnap his wife, in order to collect a hefty ransom from his wealthy father-in-law(Harve Presnell) to pay off all his debts. After they kidnap his wife, and have a very bloody encounter with a state trooper, on comes the pregnant police officer Marge Gunderson(Frances McDormand)to track down the criminals. As Marge gets closer, the job goes haywire, and what could've been a simple job, turns out to be a blood bath.<br/><br/>Macy is great as afraid Jerry Lundegaard. He is the one who starts all the trouble, and causes everything. Macy was nominated for his performance, but lost to Cuba Gooding Jr. in Jerry Maguire. It's great fun to watch Macy pretend to know what he is doing even though he has no idea. Also, playing a man who is pushed off the edge of his simple life, after his boss and father-in-law, refuses to pay attention to his new business deals<br/><br/>Steve Buscemi gives the greatest performance of his career, playing the over the top criminal, Carl Showalter. His great performance brings life and excitement, to this otherwise stale movie. It shows that it takes a lot to bring him down(woodchipper).<br/><br/>Frances McDormand won her only oscar for best actress, for playing police cheif Marge Gunderson. The midwest chick who'll stop at nothing to catch the criminals she's after.<br/><br/>After the first time you see Fargo, you may not like it, but you'll find yourself wanting to watch it over and over again, until you do. It strikes you like no other movies made in the 90s did. The Coen brothers won the oscar for their amazing screenplay. This movie is a masterpiece. Out of ten stars, it gets ten, with a bullit."
"stefan-144","6","0","1","10 January 2003"," The winter is well portrayed, the characters insufficiently so
","Being Swedish, I know of winter. I have come across it in Wisconsin, too. Fargo portrays it well. The snow, the cold, the sort of pause mode it puts on life - and the human struggle to break out of it.<br/><br/>The tempo of the film is kind of Scandinavian, and so is the acting - not only from very experienced Peter Stormare, who worked extensively with Ingmar Bergman on the Swedish Royal Dramatic Theater, years ago. There's a constrained mood on all the acting, reminding me of the Bergman ideal, also making the characters quite realistic.<br/><br/>What happens in the movie seems pretty much unavoidable, in great accordance with the drama ideal cherished by Aristotle. That is very interesting, since it's a story from real life. So life follows the laws of drama? At least when interpreted by the temperament of artists.<br/><br/>There's a significant element of parody, too. A burlesque. What makes me hesitant, is that the balance between parody and realism is not set, not consistent. How the characters speak and react, that's close to farce, while their actions and the plot itself - that's very much realism, or naturalism, to use a concept from the art of literature.<br/><br/>That is probably the reason for the actors not being able to sum up their characters and lead them to a proper end point. For just about all of them, when they have their last scene in the film, they are in limbo, not rooted at a point where events and their character would lead them. It's like they wait for the real ending.<br/><br/>Well, maybe this is an epic, not a drama, but if so, it gives so much a pretense of drama, there is no room left for the epic to flourish. Nor is there sufficient room for significant characters in the story to be exposed.<br/><br/>Another half-hour or so might have solved it. Maybe the film was too drastically treated at the cutting board."

Also, the only character that I cared about through the entire film was Marge (the policewoman) the other characters I didn't care whether they died or not, I guess that says a lot about the film.

The gore at the end is as much as people say and once again the comic in death tone is kept inappropriately.  The foot scene was amusing and I was glad to see some the annoying being shot and demolished.  The sex scene was amusing , the scene where Frances McDormand was interviewing the two didsy girls was quite funny,   but overall the story wan't great. Like There's Something About Mary the story provided a few amusing moments, but that didn't make the film good-just OK.

","I recently watched Fargo for the second time, having watched this film about two years ago. It seemed to me that I liked this film much more the first time. Fargo has the interesting storyline, great direction and superb acting, yet I felt that something was missing. A hA! Could it be a little bit more realism and perhaps a bit longer film.<br/><br/>Regardless of the fact that Frances McDormand played the part very well and even won Best Actress for it, she seemed to play her character too dumb-wittedly. Margie (McDormand's character) seems to be a couple nickels short of a dime and yet manages to solve this murder mystery (albeit a really bungled up one) in what seems like record time. No sooner has she arrived on the scene, than she already knows what happened, when it happened, who was responsible and where to go from there. I've been to Minnesota and North Dakota and the people that live there are not at all like the morons that they are portrayed as in this film.<br/><br/>The length of the movie seemed too short. If Marge had at least pursued the killers for some time, rather than stumbling upon their hideout (also too unbelievable) almost instantly, this film could have been much better. I don't like the way the Coen's wrapped up this film like they were in a hurry and needed to go somewhere.<br/><br/>Other than these problems I really liked the film and never lost attention from it. The story is quite original and leaves you wondering just what is going to happen next. The performances are top notch, especially Steve Buscemi who is humourously always referred to as a ""funny-looking-guy in some sort of general way.""

And this is what great movie makers are all about, showing us things our perceptions remain short of imagining as we read, hear or watch them happening around.

I have to wonder how people who have never lived in this part of the country react to this.  Knowing all the local references made it very amusing and recognizable."

","I liked Fargo because it was an interesting story and it shows what the Coen Bros. can do more than just comedy. It was creative in how they integrated comedy with the way that the criminal characters were really pretty sick and twisted. The characters in this are great too, how they picked actors that looked true to real life. I am a fan of all of the Coen bros. films including Raising Arizona and The Big Lebowski."

","Fargo had the potential to be one of the Coen Brothers best films. However, the ending comes so quickly and suddenly and applies little to the preceding portion of the film that it almost renders the entire experience pointless. Marge simply stumbles across the crime scene using clues which she learned early on in the film. Essentially everything between could have been cut out and the film would still have been completely logical."
"choppy","9","0","1","29 November 1998"," WOW this film is subtle.
","Fargo took me a few viewings to really appreciate, and judging by some of the other ecstatic reactions to this film, I still don't fully ""get"" it. Hidden in amongst what at first seems to be merely a quirky twist on the heist gone wrong staple is what I think is a strong message about the moral fibre of today's society.  Compare the money-hungry, deceitful, anti-social behaviour of the perennially miserable Macy and Buscemi to the constantly honest, happy, content and perennially cheerful nature of McDormand.<br/><br/>Now I usually hate films that try to sell a message, but this one does it so subtly that it has an almost subliminal impact. Two scenes at the end, one with McDormand and Stormare in the Police car and the final scene in bed sum it up.<br/><br/>Still though, it's not my favourite Coen film, that is still Millers Crossing.  And I disagree with everyone here, neither McDormand OR Brenda Blethyn should have won the best actress Oscar.  It should have been Emily Watson for ""Breaking the Waves"".  So there.<br/><br/>I give Fargo 9/10."

","Eccentric, original dark comedy that is sure to be remembered for years to come. Macy is terrific as a struggling, scheming businessman who recruits two reckless kidnappers to abduct his wealthy wife, hold her for ransom, then split the loot with him! McDormand is magnificent as a pregnant and perceptive Minnesota police chief who thinks that there may be more to the story. Brilliant, totally off-the-wall comedy/murder mystery is a perfect blend of violent action, oddball humor, and clever, insightful observations of Minnesotans. Buscemi and Stormare are a riot as bumbling, mismatched kidnappers, and the film's zany dialogue is impeccable. One of a kind, and definitely a must-see. ***"
"mattymatt4ever","9","0","1","17 October 2001"," One brilliant, original, eye-catching, hilarious, compelling piece of cinema!!!
","I just got finished watching this movie in my film class.  This is the first time I watched it straight-through, and I was very impressed and look forward to watching it again sometime soon.  Of course, I had to view it in a somewhat intelligent, focused manner--indulging the way the cinematography and setting helps tell the story, what the props symbolize, etc.--since we're studying the movie.  So I wasn't exactly kicking back on my living room couch with a glass of soda at my side, enjoying the show.  Well, I did enjoy the show--a lot!--but in a somewhat analytical way. <br/><br/>
I'll start off by complimenting the acting.  Frances McDormand earned a well-deserved Oscar for her performance as a pregnant police chief in this small, quiet Minnesota town.  You can say this is the role that put her on the map, and I'm glad she's on the map, because she's a very talented actress.  William H. Macy never ceases to please, delivering a subtle performance as a money-hungry car salesman.  Just his facial expressions alone speak a million words.  Steve Buscemi is absolutely hilarious as the talkative Carl.  He's superb at anything he does, and I think this marks one of most memorable appearances on film.  Peter Stormare is subtlely terrifying as his silent buddy.  I don't think they could've picked someone with a more piercing stare than him.  At moments you actually feel as if you're staring at the Angel of Death himself, he's so effective.  His name escapes me at the moment, but I loved the Asian guy who played McDormand's old friend.  He has one of the most hilarious scenes in the film.  I remembered him as a worker for ""Rolling Stone"" in ""Almost Famous""--also with McDormand in the cast.  He really is good!  <br/><br/>The cinematography is great!  It really brings out the coldness (both literally and figuratively) of the setting.  The music is brilliant and haunting.  The dialogue is full of zingers that film buffs will have a field day with.  I heard that people from Minnesota wrote angry letters about the Coens (who were actually born and raised in the state) for making fun of the way their people talk.  I know they must've exaggerated (I don't see how anybody can talk like that without laughing at themselves), but they must've used some element of truth.  You know what they say:  There has to be truth to every joke.  I didn't think there are people in the world who can be so stoic and cheerful, even when there's a murder taking place.  But one of the girls in my class said she spent some time in the Midwest, and the people there actually do behave a lot like the characters in ""Fargo."" Nevertheless, I couldn't help but crack up every time the word ""Ya"" was used.  Especially in that scene where McDormand was interviewing the two hookers.  I think that scene sets the record as the one with the most ""Yas"" used.  If anybody was counting, correct me if I'm wrong.  I'm sure the reputation of the people of Minnesota has changed due to this movie, and I'm sure tourists jokingly approach them with ""Yas.""  Hey, I'm from Jersey and talk nothing like the characters in ""The Sopranos,"" and I'm not complaining. I can take a joke.  I think the extremely mild manner of the main characters (minus Buscemi and Stormare) helps create an ironic tone that contradicts the atmosphere. <br/><br/>""Fargo"" has almost anything you can ask for in a movie.  It's a dark comedy, and in that department it's hilarious.  In fact--keeping in mind that this was marketed as a drama/thriller--I think I got more laughs out of this film than most straight comedies I've seen.  Of course, some may think you're a sadist for laughing at certain gags, but we don't always have to laugh at pleasant things, do we?  It's a crime drama, and in that respect it's compelling and intriguing, with some unique twists.  Not giving anything away, that wood-chipper thing--nice touch!  <br/><br/>Should you see this movie?  Ya!  Ya!  Darn tootin'!  But if you're squeamish, take a blindfold.  It gets bloody at times. <br/><br/>
My score:  9 (out of 10)"

"cathcacr","7","0","1","4 September 2001"," I like all the Coen brothers films, but...
","Like all the other Coen brothers films, this is crafted with expertise (well, at least that kind of expertise distinctive to their style) and makes for good entertainment, but -- purely aside from the artistic merits of the film -- it isn't what I consider their MOST entertaining movie.  The first time I saw this, I considered it pretty good thriller-entertainment, but not as spectacular or amazing or all that extraordinary as the critics seemed to think.  After the second time through, I figured the same thing.  Finally, after some more cinematic maturation, I watched it a third time, and basically think the same thing.<br/><br/>The story is based on real events (warning: I may not be particularly drawn toward movies based on real events, as they strike me as too journalistic for the medium, but that may be one of my idiosyncracies); it is particularly appropriate for a Coen brothers film because of the way the events transpire.  It revolves around a real slimeball's attempt to ""solve"" his monetary crises by having his wife kidnapped and held for ransom, and the money then funneled back to him.  Of course, what makes it all interesting is how things get increasingly screwed up and gruesome as the story goes on.  The Coen brothers obviously embellish events and characters with their own quirky twists and mannerisms -- e.g., from the slimy but incompetent maneuverings of the husband, to the cheery-and-cute-but-very-smart cop (played by Frances McDormand), to the criminal duo of the whiny tactician (Steve Buscemi) and his sullen but very dangerous sidekick (Peter Stormare).<br/><br/>It's most definitely better than the usual action/thriller/mystery flick, though that by itself doesn't say a lot.  My impression is that the Coen brothers put together a film that for them was pretty ""standard"" but happened to hit it on with a lot of viewers and critics; they were probably as surprised at all the attention as I was.  It's pretty middle-of-the-road for fans of the little genre that is the films of the Coen brothers.  For Coen brothers films that I both liked a lot and regard as ""distinctively Coen brothers"" (come to think of it, is there any movie they've made that isn't?), I recommend _Miller's Crossing_, _Barton Fink_, _The Hudsucker Proxy_, and _The Big Lebowski_.  (I am more mixed or undecided when it comes to the others, which includes _Fargo_.)<br/><br/>All in all this means at minimum that it's well worth watching at least once, but not a ""must buy.""  On my scale, that's a 7 out of 10."

"bigsleepj","Null","0","1","21 August 2001"," Best Score ever!!
","The Coen Brother's Fargo is somewhat of a classic, depending on the viewer. For the last five years people have been loving or hating this movie for their own reasons.<br/><br/>Some people like it because it's gory and bloody. Some people like it because it's funny. Some people like it because it's a complex human tragedy-comedy of terrifying proportions, filled with greed, evil and decay of morals.<br/><br/>Yes, all this makes a good movie. But what makes this such an outstanding movie is Carter Burwell's haunting music. Other reviewers on this site have omitted this, so I'm going to discuss it's effectiveness.<br/><br/>Movie scores are a complex business. You get movies that has beautiful music, but it doesn't compliment it in any way. Some music try to be too complex, like John William's score for the Phantom Menace. Despite the main theme and ""Duel of the Fates"" parts most of the soundtrack is like ill conceived ballet music.<br/><br/>Burwell's theme is slow and simple, like the Fargo itself. When the ""This is a True Story"" line appears you hear a solitary instrument bringing forth the tune. Then by the time they actually show the title of the movie, a full orchestra joined in. This theme explores the tragedy of ""Fargo"" and all who lives in the Coen's vision of the Northern USA.<br/><br/>The orchestral part of Fargo's Soundtrack is the best ever created for a movie. Ranks right up there with Forest Gump, Braveheart, Titanic and the Original Star Wars!<br/><br/>Fargo would have just been another independent film with a good story if it hadn't been for this great soundtrack which made this film a classic. I think there are a lot of Hollywood A-list directors crying in darkly-lit recording rooms wishing they had Fargo's main theme for their movie.<br/><br/>Who knows? Maybe ""Freddy got Fingered"" might have won Best Picture if it had this score."

","My appraisal may be controversial, but i say that this film should be the model for a new breed of woman's movie.  Marge Gunderson is a strong, hardworking, expert, feminine, and very pregnant heroine.  I wish all women could be like that.  Over the course of the film she faces horrible monstrocities, and she handles herself with a cool professionalism that is rarely seen in female characters.  This is one of my favorite movies.  I don't like it because it is a stark look at crime in a small town.  I love it because the star of this show is someone who I truly admire."

","From the beginning to end of this film I was captivated by it. The Coen brothers are great writers and this is by far their greatest achievement.<br/><br/>The acting is superb, especially that of William H. Macy and Frances McDormand. Their is not one wasted scene or shot in the entire film. Joel Coen did an excellent job as director because he knew what was needed for this to be a great movie, realistic yet original characters that an audience could relate to and care for. Some scenes are very gory and somewhat disgusting, but they are needed there and have a point, so they don't make the film any worse.

","This is without a doubt the Coen Bros' best film. Splendid cinematography, a chilling score, clever script, and brilliant performances make this quirky dark comedy a modern classic. Frances McDormand and William H. Macy are especially memorable. BTW to those who say the scene in the bar with Marge and her high-school chum Mikey was unnecessary, this is not so. Mikey tells Marge how he has married and had children, and that her wife had recently passed away. Marge believes her good friend. But several scenes later she finds out that everything he told her was a lie. This makes Marge question the sincerity of Jerry Lundengard when she first interviewed him, because if a sweet good-natured guy like Mikey can concoct such a lie then so could Lundengard. She finds out Mikey lied to her, the VERY NEXT SCENE she returns to the car dealership to re-interview Lundengard who realizes she may have put the pieces together, so he flees the scene. If Marge never met up with Mikey, she wouldn't have exposed Lundengard as a conspirator. This is the reason that amusing scene is so important. Got it? Good. Have a nice day."
"Brooklyn-10","10","0","1","7 November 1999"," Good movie, not brainwashed
","Someone made the comment that this movie must have been hyped to death for it to be rated so highly, that people must have been brainwashed. I have to relate my own experience. I saw this movie in March of 1996, when it was only in limited release, and there certainly had not yet been any hype, because so few people had seen it. I had gotten a gut feeling from seeing the previews that it was going to be good, mostly from the people involved and the fact that so little was given away in the trailers, which is so rare these days. I drove 50 miles to see this movie on one of the few screens showing it in the country. The theater was full, and it was obvious the vast majority was enjoying it immensely, as did I. So, sorry, the ""Brainwashed"" theory just doesn't apply here. That only works with movies like ""Star Wars: Episode I"". ""Fargo"" was as far from the world of hype as Minnesota is from Naboo. ""Fargo""- 10 out of 10, and that's MY opinion."

","Winner of 2 Oscars (best original sceenplay, best actress for Frances McDormand), this has to be cult film makers, The Coen Brothers (Blood Simple, Raising Arizona, Miller`s Crossing, The Big Lebowski), best film to date.<br/><br/>Set in a snowy Fargo, North Dakota, and based on a true story which happened in 1987, its the tale of a kidnapping plot, that doesn`t go exactly to plan. Jerry Lundegaard (the brilliant William H. Macy) is losing money fast as a car salesman, his wannabe quick cash schemes catch up on him, forcing him to hire two criminals, Carl and Gaear (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wife, allowing him to collect the ransom from his wealthy father-in-law. The bumbling pair are forced to kill a road cop and two civillians along the way (one of those those civvies is actually that artist formerly known as Prince, check the end credits for the ""symbol""), provoking a murder enquiry by Marge Gunderson, a dizzy but law abiding cop-ette (McDormand). The plot thickens, twists and turns, in the Coen`s inimitable way.<br/><br/>My favourite film of the 90`s so far, Fargo is a black comedy ""stroke"" thriller, which is hard to dismiss. Its true to life story, beautiful photography (thanks to Roger Deakins), wonderful characters, melancholy music, vivid script, and the way it captures the Minnesota way of life, is pure brilliance. A complete story, a complete movie, which never needs a sequel. The language has to be noted, as its one of the key points that binds the movie perfectly, and eases the thriller instinct. ""Oh you betcha!"""

I think both deserved Oscars. You really do believe McDormand-to a point, and feel for Macy as his world crashes down on top of him.<br/><br/>Personally what I liked best was seeing Rockhound and Leb from Armageddon in an earlier film, Buscemi is a scream and a very talented one too no matter what he tries. Enjoyed seeing Leb too, although he had maybe 7 words in the whole film. He is a Brutal spud in this isn't he.<br/><br/>Couple questions: what happened to Macy's wife-was she killed or what? We don't get to see her after a couple scenes in the 'hide out', maybe she was wood chipped....<br/><br/>And two-why was this such a big deal? Good film yes, but-an Oscar contender? Somehow I don't think so. If you want to see a well acted, lower budget film from 1996, set in an out of the way part of the land, with some realistic characters...Might I suggest you try LoneStar, by John Sayles.

Steve Buscemi, in my opinion the coolest actor alive, and Peter Stormare is brilliant. Totally exceptional. Frances McDormand is a little over-rated though but does give a good performance. William H. Macy is, as always, good as the car sales-man in money trouble. The film is about Jerry Lundegaard that needs money. His wife's rich father won't give it to him so he plans a scam. He hires two criminals, to kidnap his wife, and ask for a big amount of money to give her back. then her father will have to pay and the criminals will get their share of the money Jerry his.

They want to be kewl and/or popular. I like Fargo, now, too, but it took practice.  I originally saw Fargo at my local videostore for halfprice.  I liked the acting in the movie, but didn't really see that much substance in it.  But it came with that snowglobe.  I don't know if you've seen it, but it's cool.  Suddenly I had to have it.  So I bought it, stored the movie somewhere, forgot about it.  Then my friends came-a-callin'.  They wanted to see it.  So I pulled it out, dusted it off, watched it.  Then some other friends wanted to see it, and I watched it again.  And so on and so on until I realized....I kinda actually maybe sorta liked it....It hurt me, but I had to admit, Fargo was geek chic.
