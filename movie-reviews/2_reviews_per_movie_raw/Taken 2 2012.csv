"MR_Heraclius","6","41","45","20 February 2020"," Taken
","The sequel which could have started off one of the best action franchises of all time but ultimately fell flat. The movie is poorly directed by Olivier Megaton who over used shaky cam, the writing is cliched and stupid but to be honest I can't help but like it for being so bad, there is some redeeming factors like Liam Neeson who always puts in a great performance but overall the film is stupid and that's why I like it."
"balikayak","3","214","273","8 October 2012"," Unfortunately Taken!
","I was unfortunately taken to see the movie, hoping the directors (art director, etc) would have done a better job since Midnight Express. The scenario is full of awkward, hard to be believe events like Kim bombing the whole covered bazaar area which is like one of the most crowded parts of the city. While she is doing that, the dad is kept by the kidnappers who were stupid enough to leave him alone for hours and let him speak on the phone. He escapes from the place just like that, and then is followed by Turkish police cars from 1970s. Kim who was not able to drive automatic car in US, right away makes all these car moves driving a stick Taxi in the most narrowed streets. I also have to mention that all the women appeared in the movie were dressed in black veils- I don't know why, someone should explain that, also Turkey does not have a border with Albenia. The list goes on, but I don't think its worth to spend money or time."
"bilge-erdogan","3","137","172","9 October 2012"," Complete and utter failure
","This film is just a poor attempt to combine all sorts of action movie clichés brought together with a hope that it will attract action movie fans to the film. I am afraid that was a false hope as I think this film was an utter failure. Its performance cannot even be compared with the first Taken film- which I loved. Liam Neeson is marvellous as always but the scenario is awful. There are many ridiculous points throughout the film: <br/><br/>1) How does the girl manage to use three grenades in Istanbul without getting caught by Turkish forces?<br/><br/>2) Are we expected to believe all Turkish police cars are from 1970's and 80's?<br/><br/>3) It is not even a whole day spent in the city and I think we heard more than five hundred calls for prayer... <br/><br/>4) Liam Neeson fights and shoots almost 10-15 guys and I cannot remember him receiving one fist on the chin. Are all bad guys idiots that they let Liam Neeson on his own for hours to let him make phone calls and arrange his escape. <br/><br/>5) Again the bad guys who are shown to be burning with the desire for revenge are not actually that bad as they treat the guy and his family pretty well. <br/><br/>6) The bad guys fire almost thousands of bullets and miss every single shot whereas our ex agent seems to be hitting the target every single time. <br/><br/>7) We see an exceptional (impossible!) driving performance of the girl in narrow and unfamiliar streets of Istanbul where she stepped her foot for the first time in less than 24 hours. Maybe we are expected to believe she inherited (!) those natural skills from her bionic father the day she was born. <br/><br/>8) We are expected to believe that one can consider barging into an embassy courtyard driving through the security and be allowed to walk free by just one call to a guy in the golf field. Seriously??? <br/><br/>9) Some of the fighting scenes are too fast, it is impossible to understand what's going on. You just have to sit patiently for two minutes to see who collapses and who is still on his foot to understand who was a better fighter. <br/><br/>10) I thought counting in the car for the turns and noises for boat, music instrument and something else that I do not remember now was so cheesy. The boat and the music guy being in the same place forever and ever is just a laugh. ..... <br/><br/>I think I can continue with the list and add 25-50 more ridiculous items. In short I am trying to tell is that this film is not worth going to the cinema and wasting time and money on that. If you had liked the first film and expecting this one to be similar, you will be very disappointed. The story is so poor that I think it is an insult to the audience's intelligence."

","I Liked the movie but they should know more details about Turkey! Even my girlfriend she is from Russia, she told the city doesn't seem like Istanbul . Albania doesn't have border between Turkey.Budget is $45,000,000 How come did you find 80's police cars , Even those cars not driving anymore for 20 years! I never seen before Covered Women in Turkey like a Arabian Countries. In the movie every women have black cover.Mostly people in USA drive Automatic cars and the girl didn't pass driving test 2 times but The girl drives a manual car perfectly in Turkey. How come ? If you didn't go Istanbul before you won't go to Istanbul after this movie.It is not fair!I think Taken 1 was better"
"whitesocks_1","6","225","312","3 October 2012"," Such a shame
","I am a big fan of the first taken movie, it not only had professional cinematography but great action, suspense and originality. Now this sequel i am ashamed to say was a money grab by the producers. Now Luc Besson and Robert wrote the original script without being pressured by their superiors to be limited to a marketable plot, unfortunately thats what has happened to Taken 2. <br/><br/>The plot follows Liam Neeson after the events of the original and well its the pretty much an identical situation. <br/><br/>The climax however is the main issue , it's rushed. It just happens and I was left wondering why it just ended so fast. <br/><br/>I cannot say this movie was terrible because it wasn't, it was just a movie that could not even close live up to its predecessor due to lack of depth and originality. <br/><br/>Don't waste your money at the cinemas Wait till its on DVD"

","I fell for it, because I enjoyed taken even though I was told to avoid this I watched it. Whats wrong with this movie, the question should be whats right with it.<br/><br/>1. Villains are out for revenge manage to track neeson bribe their way past security yet when they face neesom they are totally incompetent.<br/><br/>2. Kim has her swimming session and the villains don't bother her at all until they have neeson and his ex wife.<br/><br/>3. Villains manage to kill hotel security very easily but not one of their bullets even scracth neeson.<br/><br/>4. Istanbul a popular tourist city is full of slums and women covered in burqas.<br/><br/>5. Taxi drivers in Istanbul have better cars than the police of turkey who have something that resembles ladas.<br/><br/>6. You can set off many grenades in a dense city but no military or police will look for you.<br/><br/>7. When villains catch you they will not pat you down for hidden weapons, or mobile phones they will just tie you with cheap plastic bands then leave you alone for you to escape.<br/><br/>8. While in a gun stand off and a baddie pointing a gun to your wives head will conveniently let you make a phone call and cant find your daughter even though you just told her in front of the baddies.<br/><br/>9. Albanians speak English with each other but some speak their native language.<br/><br/>10. You can drive a car into a US embassies courtyard, heavy artillery is fired at you but not a single bullet hits you nor does any bullet damage the engine or tires of the car.<br/><br/>11. A girl who fails her test many times is all of a sudden able to drive a car like transporter.<br/><br/>12. You hide in your fathers closet in a swimsuit and are asked to act casual and blend in yet you choose to steal clothes from hotel staffs lockers and attract all the attention.<br/><br/>13. You can count seconds on your watch blindfolded and work out the directions to the location you are kidnapped to.<br/><br/>14. You get slashed on your neck with a blade and are hung upside down to bleed to death yet later your wound automatically heals over a few hours and your fresh to go again.<br/><br/>15. While fighting camera angles and during car chases camera angles don't have to make sense you have to use your imagination.<br/><br/>16. Your typical action movie its justified to have Muslims as evil villains and they are so bad at it and so easy to kill.<br/><br/>I can go on and on with the terrible flaws in this movie which doesn't make sense and is a total waste of time."
"maurizio-mallia","5","176","258","7 October 2012"," Disappointing
","What an utter disappointment. Like many fans of the original Taken, I was looking forward to a sequel to see if it could match or in any way surpass the original. I am afraid that as as sequel I am left perplexed at the lack of any tension, real action and pace in the film. The villains were not as nasty as they should be- after all they were seeking revenge for the slaughter of friends and family and all appeared not all intimidating. There was no sharp dialogue and some scenes bordered on the risible especially when Liam Neeson was trying to give directions to his daughter on his whereabouts. The finale was rushed and overall the film lacked any bite or interest. Dull, unimaginative-only Liam Neeson kept what glimmer of hopes alive by his solid acting. However, a real shame the film could not even match or equal the original. Do not waste your time- see the original Taken and leave this sequel alone."
"melcovel","1","122","182","7 October 2012"," I'm going to pretend Taken 2 never happened!
","Terrible and a major disappointment to anyone that loved Taken like I did! Weak plot, terrible action and preposterous storyline make it laughable. I know the first one was far fetched but much more believable. Takes away from the first one!!! The fact that Kim couldn't get her license and then magically can drive a stick shift is ludicrous. The fight scenes were filmed too close up to see and the Albanians were made to look like total idiots by missing every shot and Liam landing everyone of them. The story was slow to start and seemed filled with fluff. The movie ends without a real build up leaving you wondering..... What just happened?!"
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","4","84","124","5 October 2012"," Uninspired and less exciting than the first, ""Taken 2"" is a barely passable sequel
","Liam Neeson's action-man renaissance in 2008's ""Taken"" was a most unheralded critical and box-office hit for a seemingly generic revenge flick. Writers Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen managed to captivate audiences with a streamlined story of a retired CIA operative using his skills to locate and rescue his kidnapped daughter. It was a simple concept in that it utilized family bonds as motivation, but it was made exciting through a mixture of intriguing resourcefulness and crafty violence. <br/><br/>Everything about the story of ""Taken"" was so concrete, that there didn't seem like any obvious direction for a sequel, but a gross of $226.8 million on a $25-million budget talks, and so we have ""Taken 2,"" but what Besson and Kamen have come up with this time fails to measure up to the original in almost every way.<br/><br/>This shouldn't surprise anyone considering, again, no justification existed in the original story for a sequel. Kim (Maggie Grace) couldn't just get taken again, and part of the intrigue was Mills (Neeson) having to find her despite being hours behind her captors with no idea of where they might take her. In ""Taken 2,"" it's not as complicated and the stakes don't feel nearly as high.<br/><br/>Simply, the Albanians that Mills killed en route to finding his daughter want revenge, so they track him to one of his private security jobs in Istanbul. As it happens, Kim and her mother, Lenore (Famke Janssen), decide to surprise him by flying to meet him there, though to be fair it's not that obnoxious of a coincidence, as Mills had invited them to come after hearing Lenore's current husband had canceled their family trip to China.<br/><br/>During their first full day together in Istanbul, Kim gets the idea to let Bryan and Lenore have some alone time in hopes of rekindling their relationship, but when they go into town they are followed by the Albanians, and despite Mills' best efforts, he and Lenore are taken.<br/><br/>The entire setup here is forced — really forced. It feels as though every single plot point or detail exists solely to create circumstances in which our main characters can get kidnapped, with ample occurrences both inconvenient and convenient to allow for problems and general suspense while also providing enough room for a solution.<br/><br/>We already know what Mills is willing to do for his family, so his motivation is identical to the first film, plus we know he's too skilled to stay kidnapped for long. What's required to compensate for not raising the stakes in terms of both motivation and danger is substantially more creativity, and that's where Besson and Kamen really come up dry.<br/><br/>There's one scene early on (as in once the film gets going early on) in which Mills uses Kim to help pinpoint his location in the city, instructing her to set off grenades so he can figure out how far away she is by how long it takes for him to hear the blast. It's just a tease that the film might reach its predecessor's level, however, as the ingenuity never gets any more exciting than that.<br/><br/>Director Olivier Megaton, a frequent Besson collaborator, takes over for Pierre Morel, and does nothing to help nor hurt the picture. His style is a bit more frenetic as he heavily edits the action sequences to the point where you don't get more than a second and a half at any one camera angle, but that's not a problem so much as the film's failure through and through to prevent the audience's indifference to what's going on. We were given plenty of reason to doubt Mills' success in""Taken,"" but this time around we haven't a shred. There's a moment in which we think something might take a surprisingly darker turn, but it's over in a flash.<br/><br/>The script also attempts to be a bit more theme-driven than the first film, whether just because or in effort to compensate for its pointlessness. The father of one of the Albanians Mills killed (the infamous Marco from Tripoja), the ""main bad guy"" played by Rade Serbedzija, has a few conversations with Mills about taking the lives of family members and when revenge is or isn't justified. It's legitimate notion, but a bit out of place; we're asked to consider the feelings of the random European thugs who we normally see as killing fodder for our action movies. We don't care if you're someone's son — you're a tattooed meathead who deserves to be offed if for nothing but our amusement.<br/><br/>""Taken 2″ isn't offensively bad, just uninspired and unable to make the case for its existence. At 91 minutes, it's a harmless exercise in generic action filmmaking aimed at placating the folks who clamored to see more of one man's particular set of skills, even if they're the exact same skills applied in a less-than-spectacular manner.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

"liamnoble1","1","141","215","17 October 2012"," Taken 2: Don't go
","So, its a stinker!<br/><br/>If you came to see Liam Neeson kicking ass, my advice is turn back now and save your money. This is entirely due to the inability to actually see what the heck's going on in all of the films actions sequences and stunt co ordinations. The film looks like it was filmed on the site of a permanent earthquake with a camera dangling by a rope. If you have epilepsy this might be one to avoid considering how quick its been edited. Its almost like director Olivier Megaton said ""yeah we're going for the subliminal message type look, edit it like that"" And you want anything remotely reminiscent of the first films action? well forget about it because it hasn't been included. <br/><br/>What you will be treated to however is a cheap, watered down child friendly, completely unrealistic, trashy, knock off 'Rom Com with bullets' B reel, sold purely on the title of ""Taken"" alone.<br/><br/>Huge plot holes dominate the script from start to finish, in its purest form its basically an awful rehash of the first film but 1000 times worse, placing Maggie Grace (Bryan Mills daughter) as the heroine trying to rescue her parents from a load of bungling Albanians (yes they are literally that bad, think of Manuel from Faulty Towers and you have your starting point) . Liam Neeson does his best with what he's got, but there's only so much you can do with a turd script like this. Unfortunately its so laughable that Neesons character starts to look like a paranoid delusional psychopath that sees kidnappers everywhere. They must have forgotten to include the scene where Neeson gains his super power to spot evil doers just by looking at them, but hey that's what happens so get over it!<br/><br/>Not only that but did anybody even look at a map before this script was written? Had anybody even been to Turkey or Albania? Clearly its the best location in the world to magically learn how to drive a car, because that's what Maggie Grace does! However there's also a dire lack a qualified torturers because no one can do it, or interrogate or generally manage to do anything right! Alternatively, if you feel like throwing some hand grenades off rooftops without anybody batting an eyelid then this might just be the place for you. Don't worry about the police, they'll be to busy driving around in there 1970s bangers they hauled right off the scrap heap, where this movie also came from.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the worst news is that Taken 3 already seems to be on the horizon. Many of you will be asking 'how...why....who....???' but unfortunately money speaks louder than taste. I imagine the plot will be an all black screen and Liam Neesons voice over ""Your money has been taken"". The horror that it was a 12a should have sent alarm bells ringing before I even bought the ticket, alas my money and respect for the film industry is now gone forever. What's even more painful is the fact that Luc Besson is partly responsible for this mess, Luc Besson! director and producer of some truly awesome films. <br/><br/>Please don't see this film, please don't be 'Taken' in"
"bogof_tom","2","32","44","7 October 2012"," What a let down
","Now listen to me, very carefully, script writers. The plot for ""Taken 2"" is rubbish. If you don't sort it out, I will find you, and I will kill you.<br/><br/>No, it's okay, I won't actually kill anyone, but the above serves to highlight all that remains of the ""Taken 2"" legacy: parodies and spoofs. Where the first film focused on Liam Neeson's character as being resourceful (and then threw in some no nonsense action for good measure), the second film uses plot points that make me wonder if the script writer(s) engaged their brains at any point. The daughter fails two driving tests, and by the end of the film she is driving in a high speed chase, performing hand brake turns, and throwing grenades in random directions. Grenades that, you know, the Turkish authorities don't mind anyone bringing to their country on a plane. Grenades that evaded metal detectors. Then there's the 'we will kill you, but it will be slowly, and with us not in sight, giving you the best chance of escape, Mr. Bond'-esque sequence. And oh yeah, he's still got a mobile phone after being kidnapped, because evil Albanian baddies are actually good sports who don't mind giving their captives a fair crack of the whip. And while we're on the subject, you have a mobile phone, and you know the number of your ex-CIA associates who could help you in an instant. At what point in the film do you call them? When you're dangling from a pipe in a cellar, or when you're on US soil in an embassy? Go figure.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the first film, but this was rotten. And in fairness, in hindsight, it would have been tough to measure up to the first one on the basis that there is very little more than could have been done with the idea, short of seeing Neeson kidnapped and his daughter deliver the ""I will find you, and I will kill you"" spiel. To be honest, that might have been better."

The villains that ""love"" chattering with victims, grenades going off in the center of one of world's largest cities without anyone intervening (imagine your throwing grenades in Manhattan / NYC, its more or less the same) Police cars that date from possibly 70's (novadays they are mostly Renault Megans), I am 30 years old living in Istanbul, I haven't seen those cars. A girl that can't drive automatic cars, driving a 80's manual gear Mercedes like a pro in very narrow streets, Albany - Turkey border which doesn't exist, only way into Turkey through the west is via Bulgaria or Greece, which have proper border outposts, not just a hut and 2-3 guys standing around. Veiled women everywhere... in my 30 years I haven't seen as many veiled people live as I have seen during this movie. The movie was shot in the ghettos which don't reflect the city... US Embassy is more than 30 kilometers from where the movie was shot, and you cant just rush in with a car like that... In a luxury hotel in Eminönü you cant get inside with guns, let aside causing havoc and getting away, plot was also very poor, he has a mini mobile phone which he keeps calling his daughter from, wonder why he just doesn't ask his mate in the U.S. to have his phone tracked by CIA operatives in Istanbul (we know they exist) for a rescue... All in all, very crap Bourne-wannabe movie that was clearly aimed to be shot in a 3rd world arabic country, but for some reason ended up being shot in one of the world's biggest and most historical cities."

The police cars in the movie were 1980 models and they are now exhibiting in Tofaş museum.Our police cars are recent as our buildings.But there is a huge difference between the buildings in the movie and the buildings in İstanbul.Director was focused in the old İstanbul called Historical Peninsula and in this area there are so many ancient buildings bazaars and mosques. In modern İstanbul most of the women does not wear veils as the men in İstanbul doesn't have beards like pilgrims.

"RenovatioSelcuk","7","263","447","7 October 2012"," Movie deserves 7/10, but the director does not even deserve 0...
","The movie was very good and Liam Neeson is one my favourite actors. it is great that Liam Neeson visited Turkey. I am sure that he impressed very much while he was there. However I just hated director's point of view about Istanbul, and Turkey. In some scenes you see some women wearing pitch black clothes as if they live in a country governed by Islamic rules . No!!! Turkey is not like that!!! Its constitution is more democratic than many 'democratic' countries in the world. And especially women had their rights before many 'democratic' countries in the world. For example Turkish women can vote or can be elected since 1934! Just check the history. You will see Turkish women had such rights before millions of others women living in other countries. But, I do not understand why there is not any Turkish women seen in the movie. All the movie was taken in very weird and suburban areas, and you do not see any women, but the guys. This is not Iran, this is Istanbul! I am very sorry about the director's attitude and I did not like it at all. <br/><br/>Turkey is a secular, democratic and modern country. You can see the people with very modern looking all over the city, not ninjas! The people of Turkey do not wear such a pitch black clothes like the people living in an Islamic country. Not only the appearance, but also the thoughts are modern and contemporary in Turkey! Why did director say a big lie to the world? Is there a political reason? Should a director act like a horrible politician? <br/><br/>I am fed up with seeing such horrible movies hiding the truth!

Nothing has remained from the realistic first part. This one is more like a naive boring drama with infrequent heroic acts of Liam Neeson. In fact, most of the time he looks like a pompous clown trying to be serious while playing a stupid script. As in a regular cheap movie, bad guys are not really bad and are very respectful to the main characters, always giving them plenty of time to talk and to run away. What irritates even more is ridiculously large amount of product placement. Save your time and money, don't watch this movie in theaters."
"nikhil_taneja","6","9","11","27 October 2012"," The 5 Commandments of making a Hollywood Sequel
","After watching the very badass Liam Neeson's new movie, Taken 2, which I was desperately looking forward to because the original was all sorts of fantastic, I have been enlightened in strange ways. There was this bright light, and a tunnel, and it was dark and all of a sudden, my mind was filled with knowledge that helped me figure out the art of making a big-budget hit Hollywood film sequel. Here are five commandments that can come in handy for you too, whenever you make your hit Hollywood movie and are confused about what to do in the sequel:<br/><br/>1. Thou shalt not have any plot, whatsoever<br/><br/>It's sort of stupid, isn't it? Because if the studio had a script with a plot or a story of its own, why on earth would it waste it on a sequel? It would much rather make another movie out of it, which could have its own sequel with no plot! Actually, it's sort of genius, then!<br/><br/>This, of course, is painfully obvious in Taken 2, where the plot is exactly as elaborate as the movie's poster tagline: They want revenge. They chose the wrong guy. In the original, Taken, the daughter of a retired CIA agent, Bryan Mills (Neeson) is kidnapped by human traffickers and he has to use his ""particular set of skills"" to save her. In Taken 2, Mills and his wife are kidnapped by the same guys — because they want to kill him for killing their relatives in the first movie. The only thing thinner than this plot is the IQ of the mafia, which brings us to the next point.<br/><br/>2. Thou shalt have stupid bad guys Of course, this is an obsolete argument, because if the bad guy was intelligent, the good guy would die and more than anything else, there would be no more sequels. So it's important for villains to do daft things like not kill the good guy after they capture him because they want him to feel pain (*cough*, The Dark Knight Rises, *cough*).<br/><br/>But here's the level of daftness of the bad guys in Taken 2. In a major turning point of the movie (it's even in the trailer), Mills' ex-wife is held on gunpoint and he's asked to give up his arms and be taken, or his ex-wife dies. Like a good estranged husband, Mills gives up his arms, but after making a minute-long phone call to his daughter in front of the bad guys, systematically explaining to her the situation he is in right now and what she needs to do to not get caught, as the understanding, well-intentioned bad guys wait for him to be done, because they probably have daughters too, you know. And after all, the most he could have been doing on the call was call reinforcements, right? Wait, what?<br/><br/>3. Thou shalt have foreign villains It has always made so much more sense to Hollywood to have villains who are not only menacing and evil, but talk in a language, that – HORROR OF HORRORS – they can't understand! So Hollywood villains are generally outsourced cheap labour from Eastern Europe, Russia, the Middle East and South America (never India, because Indians probably don't have the time to be evil since they are so busy in taking over US jobs and driving cabs). Also, it's just creepier when the good guy has no clue if the bad guys are plotting a nuclear strike or discussing Bigg Boss in front of him.<br/><br/>Taken 2 takes this commandment and as a first, turns it uniquely over its head — in the movie, it's not just the good guy who can't understand the frightening foreign villains, apparently the hipster foreign villains can't understand him either (because learning English is so mainstream, yo). Or else why would the bad guys spend approximately 15 minutes of screen time looking for Mills' daughter — after he called her in front of them and told her to hide in the closet?<br/><br/>4. Thou shalt have fiery dialogue exchanges sort of Every mainstream Hollywood movie depends as much on its big-budget special effects and action as it does on its dialog. *chokes with laughter*. Sorry, I couldn't get through with that sentence with a straight face. Here's an example of the exact dialogue exchange the main bearded baddie has with Mills, after he has caught him and his wife, and is torturing them — with his accent, that is — rather than, you know, killing him:<br/><br/>Bad guy: I will kill you because you killed my sons Mills: But they kidnapped my daughter first! Bad guy: I don't care, they were my sons! Mills: But they sell young girls to Arabs!! Bad guy: BUT THEY WERE MY SONS. Mills: You know what, just kill me. Before your accent or logic do.<br/><br/>Okay, maybe I paraphrased that last bit, just a little bit.<br/><br/>5. Thou shalt substitute intelligence with action<br/><br/>So where do the studios put the money that could have bought them a decent plot, good dialogue writer, and locally-sourced American bad guys that could have helped the unemployment rate too? Answer: In LOTS of unapologetic, in-your-face action and kickass action. Taken 2 has a lot of those, and that's always, always a good thing.<br/><br/>There's also a sixth, secret commandment here, which really isn't that much of a secret, or much of a commandment, for that matter. No matter how badly you do, if the audience liked the first movie, it will watch the sequel and then wait for the threequel to buy the DVD box-set (guilty, as charged). And where Taken 2 is concerned, plot or no plot, watching Liam Neeson kick butt is always going to be worth it!<br/><br/><ul><li>Nikhil Taneja (Firstpost.com) www.twitter.com/tanejamainhoon</li></ul><br/><br/>For more reviews: http://www.firstpost.com/author/nikhil"

","Well if you don't think on the storyline the movie is really good. But the message into the movie are to obvious to be left alone. 1.First of all the Albanians would not speak English with each other would they know? And the majority in Albania are in fact non Muslim so this group would now have Islamic tattoos on their head. Especially their supposed home are not Muslim.... Having a Serb play that role says it all, like having Russians playing Americans(you ask yourself why they could not find a human to play their own kind). Even if the first movie but an ugly face on all Albania this on is just ridiculous. When an American or french does something bad he is just a robber, thief or perverts. But when an Albanians does something he is an evil Albanians.... 2.Turkey and Albania does not share any borders, nor do I think Greece would let Albanians travel with guns through their country without good inspection. 3. Yeah and Turkey is not Iran for the fact either. It is probably the most modern country that have a big Muslim amount of believers and compared to the rest of the world it is really secular. 4. The girl(American) cant handle an automatic car in USA but she can drive manually in Istanbul a la Milan roads? <br/><br/>Look I know it is only a movie and superman does not exit in reality even though you can see him in a movie. But this movie is so unreal that it sad to see that they really work hard to get their political message to the audience. It makes me sad and disappointed that such methods are used.<br/><br/>Taken showed a backside of the world that probably are real awful world but the evil men are not evil because they are a certain kind of ethnic group or religious. They are evil because they are evil."

","When initially hearing that there was going to be a sequel for Taken, I was immediately sparked with interest and ultimate hope that this movie would fall nothing short of great. The first movie was encompassed with fantastic action scenes, a swiftly paced structure coupled with an intriguing story line leaving viewers perpetually glued to the TV screen. Despite some irritating characters, Liam neeson's persona overshadowed the others, with his remarkable ability to draw the audience in with a cool edgy, smart spy and professionalism he'd likably envelop throughout the film. The movie also had the ability to elevate us into the realm of gangsters, mobs and hit-man within the gruesome and morbid business of sex trafficking. The sheer reality of this gritty world evoked a sense of realism, which served to elevate anger for the villains of the film, teaming with Liam as he embarked on a brutal crusade, slaughtering all those whom would step in his path. This formula complimented the film greatly, the notion of a loved one being taken, evoked emotional, and personally issues, and it worked, however replicating this into a sequel may be difficult.<br/><br/>Through analyzing both films, it is inevitable to concur that they both mirror similar formulaic traits and themes. This idea can be easily parralled with the 'Hangover' franchise, as the producers believed repeat offending could spring success, which it did. Therefore would it be safe to say how both films demonstrate evoke deep emotional complexities from love ones being taken, the persona's futile quest to cultivate through their enemies (predominately the whole motif of the film) in order to retrieve what had been taken from them, a successful formula? The answer is yes, as within 'The hangover' audiences will continuously indulge their original interest to exert effort 'Cash' into a previous film they'd already seen. It is evident this is the case with taken 2.<br/><br/>Deespite my cynical evaluations of taken, i will suggest how i perceived the sequel to be pure cinematic enjoyment, but nothing more. The point Iam trying to articulate here is, If you immensely enjoyed the sheer brilliance of the first one, then you will thoroughly enjoy the second, although not equally. Your emotional response will be heightened as an attempt to humanize the mother did served to provide likability and evoke an evident care factor in her capture.Still remarkably serves to magnify elements presented in the first film, though this formula does work, it cannot live up to the original story, perpetual tension, excitement and elevation of raw realism and action of the first film. I'd say if your a fan, you might-en regret seeing this, if not, it wouldn't be the end of the world to give this one a miss.<br/><br/>Ultimately I will reward it 7 out of 10."
"azanti0029","3","24","36","14 October 2012"," A poorly made sequel with only the dollar sign firmly in mind
","Now look, I am going to say from the start, I like Liam Neeson, a good solid actor, even if lately his roles seem to be that of the brooding loner, perhaps very understandable considering recent personal circumstances and its a role he plays very well, so no problem with that. I loved the original movie, I saw it at the cinema, rented it, own the DVD and have shown it to many people. Its a great film, slick, fast, sets up its own universe rules as just the more realistic side of a James Bond movie, and it doesn't break those rules or lapse into total absurdity. Sure Neeson does impossible things but we get that and go along for the ride.<br/><br/>Here though, something went seriously wrong. The action relocated to Istanbul could have been potentially very interesting and the basic story, as shown in the trailers, so no spoilers here, is that the family of the men he killed in the first film want their revenge. I like this idea, that those seemingly meaningless extras whose job it was to basically die in the first film, actually have friends and relatives who care about them and want to see Neeson dead. In the world that Taken has set up, this is all very plausible and I am sure seemed a great idea on paper. So what happened? <br/><br/>The script then becomes riddled with ideas that are beyond dumb, and Istanbul is reduced to a minor backdrop and not used to its most effective use and as can be seen from other reviews, Turkish people found the film and its depiction a little offensive, I am not surprised. Most of the film could have been set almost anywhere except for a couple of wide shots. Characters do and say things that make no logical sense at all and the rules of the Taken universe are constantly broken. Yes we can suspend our disbelief to a point, but the film reaches a level of absurdity where your just squealing in your seat that this really is awful. Some of the acting from the supporting cast isn't great either but maybe that's down to the very poor tools (Script) they were given to work with. The action scenes are dumb and seem devoid of the tension and abrupt impulse that came with the first movie. Such a shame, because with a good script I would be quite happy to watch this character in any number of scrapes and I do enjoy a well written and well directed action flick with a good story, unfortunately this had none of those elements. If you have to watch it, wait for the DVD, even if there is an extended cut, I fail to see how it will resolve any of the issues here. Wake up Hollywood, we really aren't this dumb. So many Producers on one movie - ever heard of 'Too many cooks?'"
"reload_1171","1","36","59","6 October 2012"," Very predictable, fake copy of ""Taken 1""
","For me it looked too fake. Especially when Liam escaped from Albanians. Bad guys were too idiot not to sit and keep an eye on him. And the girl blowing bombs all over in Istanbul was too funny. <br/><br/>Mainline:<br/><br/>Movie is very predictable, if ""Taken 3"" comes out then I better stay away from it, since I exactly know what is gonna happen next. Again same story: His daughter will be kidnapped and CIA agent will come and get her. I think next one will be in Palestine or some other country that is against Muslims, or it might be in Vietnam. Indeed it did not have to involve Muslims there. Muslims are not friends with US and I am so tired of it. I see it in the news and in such freaking movie too :(((<br/><br/>And dude was a hero of all times, before it was King Kong now it is Liam Neeson. He got couple alcoholic friends who can solve issues and they got connections in Embassies all over the World. Plus I hate it how they show Istanbul police. I been to Istanbul and i have seen how strong and good looking was police in turkey. But in this movie they are riding some old small cars and tripping on the road :(( Like one of those France cops used to drive in 1960<br/><br/>It was funny how Yellow cab in Turkey simply went inside US embassy without any problem. Totally fake.<br/><br/>Conclusion: <br/><br/>I was very disappointed. This actor was one of my favorite :( He looked too old and wheww...when he said it : "" I will be back "" or when he said it "" I will go and do I was taught to do ( or smth like that,meaning he got trained to kill and he do not know anything else in this world )"" ==== it was fake, disgusting, and too old fashioned phrases. It was from Terminator... It was before we used to like it when actor says smth very cool... But these days we expect and like movies to be more humble and to shut your mouth and do the damage. I mean exactly this: Keep it gang, keep it cool and do not tell us you are trained very very well...<br/><br/>And should we think Albanians are such nerds? It looked from their faces they are born killers. And how come they can't shoot even straight :(<br/><br/>Too tired of politics involving movie...I was on the side of Liam and his daughter on Taken 1. But here Taken 2 I was hoping at least the story gonna end with gangs gonna kill Liam. But this America(n) likes to show how strong and well trained CIA ex-agent - he can destroy anything and anyone in Asia :(<br/><br/>Sad very Sad Pls make it more real not fake."
"christianhh","7","75","134","6 October 2012"," Good, but not great
","First off, I enjoyed the film, and think it was worth the money I paid to see it. While other reviewers have been beating this film down, I find that the story itself was carefully structured in the beginning and grants it believability from that point. By carefully structured, I'm mostly talking about the way an ex wife brings her daughter to Istambul to see her ex-husband.<br/><br/>The action sequences are, frankly, amazing. But not being an action junkie, I tend to go more for the story. What bothered me about the story was the portrayal of Kim Mills' boyfriend, and the resolution at the end of the film.<br/><br/>Just to note, the sequence on the rooftops of Istambul, someone mentioned it was believable, I wholeheartedly agree... let's just say one of the characters put guts and enthusiasm on display without suddenly becoming an expert... 'nuff said...<br/><br/>I loved Taken, I enjoyed Taken 2."

","Just got back from a special advance screening of Taken 2 in London. If you enjoyed the first film, you will very much enjoy this.<br/><br/>What I will point out is that this is almost a parody of the first film - there are lots of in jokes, references and humor directed at the style of the first film - especially how protective Brian Mills (Liam Neeson) is of his daughter. There are lots of funny scenes involving his daughter, him and his daughter's boyfriend.<br/><br/>The action is there and as brutal as always. There are some great speeches and lines very similar to that famous ""I will find you"" speech in the first movie.<br/><br/>The audience I watched this with laughed a lot - this is a much more light hearted film than the first and doesn't take itself seriously which is great. As mentioned, it is more of a parody of the first film, with everything magnified by 10. It had a very similar tone to what was great about the original Bourne Trilogy.<br/><br/>It is everything a fan of the first film would wish for - the speeches, the action, the humour and the brutal efficiency of Liam Neeson's 'Brian Mills'.<br/><br/>Enjoyed this very much - a definite for fans of the first film and a must see for anyone else."

","This is my first review and I'm doing it because I now believe that I have a responsibility to save people some money.<br/><br/>I don't believe that I've ever seen a so cliché'd, non-credible, infinitely discrepancy-having, incredibly predictable and stupid movie.<br/><br/>Wow, these writers must've had zero self-criticism when they wrote this and believed that they had a good script. The bad guys are portrayed as Albanian mafia which at first seem very competent - a property expected from people reaching such level of crime and coordination. But when the guns started popping they immediately turned retard. One could predict the outcome of absolutely every scene throughout the movie. It contained all of the typical clichés. The typical ""leave the ex CIA-agent prisoner unguarded"", terrible drivers miscalculating the timing when crossing a railroad crossing and killing themselves and getting their brains blown out when peeping through a peephole. <br/><br/>If you like this type of a movie - by all means go ahead and waste your money on a ticket. But if you enjoy well made and smart movies - absolutely don't. The other reviewers of this movie giving this a good grade must be herbally medicated or intellectually impaired accepting this blatant attempt of stealing money out your pocket excuse for a movie.<br/><br/>I give it two out of ten, just for the joy I had trash talking the movie with my friends after.

"acexen","2","15","23","15 October 2012"," Ridiculous movie. Badly researched. Wooden acting. Pah! An hour and a half of my life that i will never get back!
","I was so excited about the prospect of seeing this movie as i had thoroughly enjoyed Taken but Taken 2 but a huge disappointment. <br/><br/>I thought the acting was terrible. The intimacy/connection between the mum, dad and daughter seemed ever so fake.<br/><br/>Having been to Turkey a number of times, i have no idea why they would pretend that Albania borders on to Turkey when it does not. As other reviewers have said, the police cars were ancient relics which have been decommissioned for decades... <br/><br/>The actors playing Turkish people clearly should have been better researched. I have been to Istanbul a number of times and women appearing head-to-toe in a burqa is certainly NOT the norm. Many observant Turkish Muslim women dress in tesettür, a head-scarves and light cover-all topcoat, when going out in public. This satisfies the Islamic admonition to modest dress without infringing Turkish law which prohibits religious dress in public places.<br/><br/>You may see women in burqa (full-body covering, with veil), but they will probably be visitors from other countries with a stricter interpretation of Islamic dress traditions. The veil is actually outlawed in Turkey (but the law is little enforced), and even the wearing of head-scarves in secular contexts (universities, government offices, etc.) is controversial. The films depiction of Istanbul is VERY far from the true image. European dress styles prevail for sure.<br/><br/>Towards the end, Lenore (the mum) falls in and out of consciousness about 15 times. It is completely unrealistic.<br/><br/>Kim (the daughter) who has yet to pass her driving test in the US, is suddenly an expert at driving with a gear stick and performs some truly remarkable stunts around the narrowest streets of Istanbul. Again, completely unbelievable. Never mind the distance she ran over various roofs and no one stopped her or the fact that she sent a number of grenades exploding in one of the busiest cities and one of the busiest tourist hot spots in the world.<br/><br/>Bryan (the dad) performs his usual fantastic fight scenes and is cool throughout his interactions with the horrible Albanian family who have returned to seek their revenge. The whole thing with the daughters new boyfriend was unnecessary, but i did wonder throughout the movie whether he would somehow be linked to the Albanian family... <br/><br/>The ending is somewhat predictable but i'll let you discover that on your own. <br/><br/>In summary, I feel it was very badly researched and was somewhat rushed. The first movie was fantastic and Taken 2 was truly abysmal. Liam Neeson's fight scenes are the only part of the movie worth watching. Oh and visit Istanbul for yourself. It really is a fantastic city."
"DTKinetic","8","74","141","6 October 2012"," Solid Sequel
","When I heard there was going to be a Taken 2, I must admit, I didn't have a positive reaction. It just seemed completely unnecessary given the plot of Taken, and its near ideal ending, I just didn't want to see the whole thing rehashed all over again in a sloppy way.<br/><br/>However, I went to see Taken 2 and I had a pleasant experience. They took the storyline and characters into full consideration. In the original Taken, the girl, Kim, seemed like a brat and all you saw her do was laugh, smile and run when she got her way and cry when things go wrong. Lenore seemed cold and proud of herself as well, only to be humbled when Bryan (Liam Neeson) proved her right of the dangers of international travel. <br/><br/>In Taken 2, both characters are more mature, more respectful and watchable, and are more involved in the plot. Because the antagonists are after everyone, Liam and Lenore as well as Kim, it makes an interesting triangle of how everyone plays their part and help each other out.<br/><br/>The movie is not over-coated with the action sugar with loud music and explosions everywhere. It has a great deal of thought, suspense, and a share of original technique and even dialogue, just like the original. Istanbul provides some good locations, both intriguing scenery and gloomy scenery which can also help in taking the movie seriously.<br/><br/>Sure, it has it's flaws, and the camera-work is sometimes choppy, but the point is, if you thoroughly enjoyed the first Taken, you should see this one too."

Then as soon as it becomes tense again, Liam reminds you who the real bad ass is and takes care of business. They did a good job shooting the film and the story line is a good one for a second movie.

"captaincameron","2","20","33","7 October 2012"," Watch the first one many times and enjoy, because the sequel is terrible
","I was enthused about Taken 2. The first Taken was an awesome flick on so many levels—sure, if you want to see Shakespearian acting a dialogue, Taken (the first) was not for you. But if you want to see action, dialogue, believable characters, and some gritty but realistic (mostly) violence, Taken (the first) was awesome. If you want to see action, dialog, some believable characters, and some gritty but realistic (mostly) violence, then go back and watch the first Taken movie. You will not find much of any of these in Taken 2. To be fair, Taken 2 is not the worst movie that I have seen in the theaters this year. That honor goes to Dark Shadows, which is, I believe, the new standard for disappointment in a film that had great actors, great directors, and great promise. But wow, Taken 2 came close to being as bad. I always indicate ""May be spoilers"" in my reviews on IMDb in case I let something slip, but I try not to let many details out, because regardless of how good or bad the film was, I believe that the people involved deserve respect for their efforts, and I am willing to admit that I may be wrong in my reviews, so I don't want to ruin any surprise. Fortunately, with Taken 2, the above warning is not all that necessary. It is an ACTION film. In theory. After about the first half hour, things eventually started moving at more than the glacial pace the movie started with, and that began with Liam Neeson (OMG!) knocking on someone's door. Taken 2 was—once you get past the first half hour or so—wildly predictable. A few (and very few) Luc Besson-style fight scenes and one really long car chase. There was one twist where Winnie The Pooh looked down through a hole in the roof and said ""It puts the honey in the basket or it gets the hose again,"" and that was kind of scary. But wait, that didn't happen. That must have been when I nodded off and dreamed that a child's cartoon combined with a book/movie written more than 20 years ago had more entertainment and action value than Taken 2. The key to a great movie is to have a great opening sequence to bring people in, a middle sequence with a great story with great characters, dialog, action, romance, etc., and a great ending—often with a twist involving the characters, dialog, action, romance, etc. The key to a good movie is to have two—or even one and quarter—of these attributes. Taken 2 had, well, none. Opening sequence—boring. Middle sequence—poorly put together. Ending—weak, weak, weak. I could add another weak and that would almost make for a month that you should avoid wasting your time or money on Taken 2. Please take my advice—it is better to get the hose again from Pooh than to sit through this film."

","Unfortunately, it was disappointment because of scenario and directors. I noticed some main failure when I was watching. Firstly, writers should shame on them. (Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen) If you are doing a film which related at the real time, you can not create a new world. Why am I saying this ? Because ıf you know geography or if you used Google maps at least one time, you should know Turkey does not have border with Albania. Also I can say Turkey's border does not look like parking barrier. I mean you can not pass suddenly or when do you want. When the people who never saw İstanbul, watch the movie they can think what a worst place, because director showed the city like a 3th world countries' slum. I am living from 22 years in this city. I never saw this kind of covered women. It looked like Arabic county not Turkey I suggest to director, he should use also Google images. As everybody knows American movie sector likes to show action. However, the girl who daughter of CIA agent, bombing three grenades in the center of city where 13 million people living. Look at the luckiness no one coming. We are not talking about Somalia. Let's try shooting grenades and guns in Istanbul and count how fast special forces and police will be on your head. Also police is using car which used at 1970s. The production company says, we spent $45,000,000 for this film. I am not clear, why they used our 1970s polices' car at 2012. If you are not doing science fiction movie, you should scene of real life. Otherwise people can start to think they are doing on purpose. When I watched the movie, I remember the Midnight Express (1978). Also that film was in Turkey and ıt was showing in the same way. <br/><br/>Put the popular actor and say action It already passed trend. If you want to see popular actors, you can watch The Expendables(2012). This was another director fault. They put the Liam Neelson on the front and wait everything from the actor. As I said I have respect to Neelson but only actor can not save the all movie. Also they put movie under the action category. There were really less action scenes also some action scenes passed suddenly. You can not understand what happen and how. <br/><br/>For to be clear, some people can take me nationalist. They can think he is from Turkey. That's he is saying like this. As I said ıf we are not doing science fiction like Star Wars or The Day After Tomorrow, you have to be realistic. If someone make a film about America and they show United State has a border with China , I can say the same things."

","I am a fan of Liam Neeson and Taken-1 but I did not like this movie at all. When I first heard of the movie shot in Istanbul I thought it was gonna be a great advertisement for Istanbul (and Turkey of course) but it was not at all. I think it is the worst way to see both the Istanbul and Turkey! The city and the country look worse than Iran! I felt like they (the director and/or scenarist) intentionally wanted Turkey to look like one of the most conservative Islamic countries! I have news for you people, we are not like that. You do not see women wearing black veils everywhere! Turkey is a secular country and most of the women prefer to have a modern look and they care about their freedom. The other thing is the police cars they used in the movie, GOD they looked so ridiculous! The movie is so away from the reality. I don't even remember if we ever used such cars as police cars in Turkey! I just think the film producers just went cheap and used the cheapest cars they could find. Turkish Cultural Ministry should be more careful about the movies that are planned to be shot in Turkey. Bottom line: the movie looks like as if the film crew took a vacation to see the Istanbul and they said ""wait a minute, let's shoot a movie in the mean while""!"
"seanebuckley","3","24","45","7 October 2012"," Dreadful.
","Taken was a rare movie that somehow captured the hearts and minds of the cinema masses without being particularly good. Taken 2 is much worse. Its like the grey-scale version of the first film, there is no plot, no direction and it has a amazingly juvenile script. Its hard to believe any adult human beings were involved in making this movie.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, Liam Neeson is by all accounts a good actor but I've rarely seen a performance of such disconnect and disinterest. All he does here is punch and mope. Neeson's Mills is barely a character aside from his mumbled, failed, half cocked one liners. Also, Famke Janssen presents one of the single most insultingly bad performances i've seen in modern times. I found it hard to sympathise with anyone in the film, everyone is so unlikeable and stupid. Watching Maggie Grace prance around in her knickers throwing grenades and drawing circles was also dreadfully misplaced and laughable.<br/><br/>There are a few non sensical, Hollywood moments too, such as sinister terrorists using flimsy plastic ties to try and hold a dangerous 'spy'. Or when Neeson drives through the American embassy blockade for no other reason than to see some bullets fly and to re-affirm the notion that he will never ever be hurt. The movie also seems to be heavily edited at choice moments of violence; this was surely to secure the coveted 12a rating helping the movie to be seen by as many adoring juveniles as possible. A good example of this is in the films rushed ending where a few kills happen without defining shots or sound-effects which was ironically more painful to watch. We have seen this trend before especially with the more enjoyable Die Hard 4 in which lines were clearly re-dubbed and violence was trimmed needlessly.<br/><br/>The fighting and action should be the saving grace but its difficult to follow and uneventful at best. There are so many better movies that have done this very thing much better, so why bother? It tries its hardest to look exactly like and to be as exciting as The Bourne Movies but fails miserably on both counts.<br/><br/>This movie is a complete and utter failure."

"moviemaniac008","4","4","5","14 November 2012"," When too much is kind of like too little...
","The original Taken is an action movie that I liked a lot. It's been a while since I last saw it, and yeah, I was a younger and less mature viewer back then, but what I remember is that it was an awesome action film. Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy this second film all that much.<br/><br/>Bryan Mills and his family have re-adapted to their own life back in the United States following the events of Taken. One day, Bryan has work to do in Istanbùl, and convinces his daughter and his ex-wife to join him on the trip. Their daughter hopes that they will get back together, and sends them off on a date. Little do they know, however, that an Albanian old man and his bunch of goons are seeking vengeance for his son's death in the first movie, and they kidnap both Brian and his ex-wife. Bryan escapes, and with the help of his daughter, will try to save his ex-wife.<br/><br/>The movie could have been genuinely awesome, and yet so much went wrong with it, it's almost unbelievable. The idea of the dad and the daughter teaming up to save the mother/ex-wife wasn't a bad one, and could have been executed very decently had the relationship between the two not relied so much on clichés. Brief example of such clichés: Daughter thinking she can play Cupid by trying to get her parents back together, overprotective father not too happy of the idea of his daughter having a potential boyfriend. It just seemed so cliché and added nothing at all to the story.<br/><br/>The action scenes were awful, and that is probably due to the sloppy editing. In one scene, Bryan is being a bad ass and disarming three armed Albanians at once, but it is pretty difficult to make out anything going on at all. Most of the time, they're too over-the-top. I don't mind surrealism here and there, but when the action is too unbelievable, I tend to stop enjoying it. Example, one car chase scene is actually well-shot, but I couldn't quite get over the fact that the girl who was driving a manual car had never even passed her automatic driver's license. The only real action scene I liked was at the end, some pretty intense hand to hand combat between Bryan and one of the henchmen.<br/><br/>Even the villains are bad. Rade Sherbedgia is an actor I really like (Boris the Blade is one of the best characters ever). In here, he just looks bored, and with reason, too: The scriptwriters give him nothing to work with. He sits on a couch and waits for his dumb-ass henchmen to call him. He fires a gun once, and - spoiler alert - it is empty. His henchmen are idiots, too. I'm no expert in shooting a weapon, but it makes perfect sense to shoot at something you can see, that way you have more chances of hitting your target. While Bryan hides behind a wall, the two henchmen shoot at the wall with no result (thick walls?). While they reload, Bryan gets out of cover, and shoots them dead. Rinse and repeat all along, and you've got a Taken 2.<br/><br/>Other irregularities are present as well: The girl throws grenades all around town and the police never shows up, the henchmen don't look carefully in the closet when the girl is hiding (Normally you would think of looking behind the clothes?). And that's only part of what the film has to offer if we talk about stupidity.<br/><br/>Still there's some positive to be had: Liam Neeson still gives an excellent performance, he's really into character. Maggie Grace and Famke Janssen are also very good as supporting actresses. The beginning is a bit long and relies a bit too much on clichés if you ask me, but at least it was well acted and engaging. Finally, that one hand-to-hand combat scene I told you about earlier is also really awesome.<br/><br/>Overall, there's not many redeeming things out of watching this movie. Maybe you'll walk out a smarter and more mature viewer after pointing out all the irregularities in this movie. There's some positive to be had, but most of the action is sloppy and not thrilling, which is exactly why I watch an action film: to be thrilled. This is the kind of movie that you wait for cable TV to show in a couple years, but it is not worth the rental price and definitely not worth a movie ticket at the theatre."

","When I first saw this movie I enjoyed only the video effects. The story was not interesting at all and it had a lot of false scenes which show negative sides of Albanian people which is not true. Especially the end of the movie is a total disaster and the worst thing that you guys can think of Albanians. When an Albanian gives the word, it is saint for him and he will do whatever it takes to keep it. It is better to be dead than not to keep the given word. This is how Albanians consider it and I think that the end of the movie is a wrong fact for Albanian people. Try not to create a bad image of the people worldwide especially if you do not know them. It is not a good thing for the communities and different people to create a bad image for other communities."

"ascremer","2","12","21","10 October 2012"," Nothing like Taken + Islamophobic
","I really enjoyed Taken and was looking forward to watching this movie. Not only was the plot nothing like the exciting story of the first movie but the depiction of Albanians and Turkey was motivated by Islamophobia. The tattoos of the Albanian gang depict the crestcent and the moon of Islam (which was also present in the first movie); further, the entire main idea of the movie is about the evil Muslim. The movie begins with an Islamic funeral; prayers are said; greetings all refer to Islamic vocabulary etc. In addition, the depiction of Turkey and Istanbul is completely biased. 99% of the females on the streets were wearing black burqas. Yes, a large percentage of Turkish women cover, but they cover lightly. Only a very small minority would wear the black burqa and they usually tend to stay in their neighborhoods. If you go to the historic peninsula of Istanbul, where almost the entire movie is shot, you will see more un-covered women than those wearing burqa. However, in order to make an Islamophobic statement, the movie makers chose to have every female in the movie wear long black burqas. Also, the police cars that they have used were actually utilized in the 1980s. Once again the Muslim world was exaggerated into a submissive, backward society. This was especially obvious when at the end of the nightmare overseas in the 'third world', they portrayed the happy American people under the sunset with blonde girls rollerblading and the milkshakes ordered at the diner. The filmmakers planned to achieve a cliché and biased contrast of the two worlds with an unrealistic happy ending at home. While these details are not crucial to the plot, they once again prove the Islamophobic and ignorant/biased point of view that Hollywood chooses to portray. Unfortunately, this perspective is one that we should try to avoid in today's society."
"estebangonzalez10","8","16","30","6 October 2012"," Liam Neeson doing what he does best
","¨Listen to me carefully Kim: Your mother is going to be taken, and people are gonna come for you to. ¨<br/><br/>I find it almost impossible not to like a film starring Liam Neeson in this type of role. He is such a great and serious actor, but it's like these roles were really made for him. I don't care how stupid the script might have felt, or how poorly edited the action scenes were; I really love Liam Neeson in this role. I think he's much better than Tom Cruise in Mission Impossible, or Daniel Craig in James Bond, or even Matt Damon in the Bourne trilogy. That is how much I like this great actor playing this retired Ex-CIA agent trying to save his family. Taken was one of my favorite films of 2008, I loved everything about that movie. Taken 2 (loved that they stuck with a simple title for the sequel instead of adding something lame after the two may not be as nearly as great as that film was, but it still is a lot of fun and has Liam Neeson doing what he does best. This is a very predictable, formulaic film, but he just makes it that much better. French Director, Olivier Megaton, was fortunate to work with Neeson because without him this movie would've been terrible. The action sequences weren't as cool as his previous film Colombiana (which also got a lift thanks to Zoe Saldana's performance). The change of director from the first film might not have worked to well, but producer Luc Besson and screenwriter Robert Kamen were back on board. Besson, who directed some great films in the 90's (Leon being one of my personal favorites) must not like directing very much because he has stuck mostly to producing and writing. He could of done a better job here with the sequel, but I think he was relying heavily on Neeson's performance, which let's face it makes this franchise so much better than it really is. I still loved this movie and had a lot of fun despite not being as good as the original.<br/><br/>Former CIA agent, Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson), succeeded in bringing his daughter back after being kidnapped in Europe, leaving dozens of dead bodies behind. These men were responsible for his daughter's kidnapping and messed with the wrong person. Some time has passed and Bryan is completely dedicated to his daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace), who he's trying to help pass the driving test. He's also a bit obsessive with her new boyfriend, and sometimes goes over the limit when trying to protect her. His ex wife, Lenore (Famke Janssen), is going through a separation in her second marriage and Bryan begins to get closer to her. He invites Kim and Lenore to meet up with him in Istanbul for a job which will only take him a few days. What begins like a nice vacation for the family ends up being a nightmare when they discover they are being followed by the father of one of the kidnappers that Bryan killed while rescuing his daughter. Murad (Rade Serbedzija) has sworn revenge for his son's death and for the death of the rest of the victim's family who worked with him. This is where the action begins and does not stop up to the very end.<br/><br/>I really do hope this franchise ends here because there is not really much more you can add to this. Taken 2 is not as intense as the original, but it still had me entertained during the full 90 minutes. I might be a little biased because I really like Liam Neeson. I admit the script isn't as gripping or smart than the original, but it was still inventive enough for us to enjoy a second installment. There are a lot of hugely implausible scenarios, but I tend to be a bit open minded when I go to the movies. I go to be entertained, and that is exactly what I got out of Taken 2. It was really going to be very difficult for this sequel to live up to its predecessor, but it worked quite well for me. I can understand why some people may not have liked this film as much, but for the most part I think that fans of the first film will leave satisfied at the end. It is really a lot of fun.<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com"
"akupm","3","5","7","18 June 2014"," Taken 2
","In my thoughts, the stylish cinematography was mastered well by Romain Lacourbas. He used different range of colours like a Japanese production. My eyes captured the wonderful Los Angeles, Instanbul, Alabanian and Paris landscape without an ugly rush like some other fast pace action films. The visual was like staring into a painting. The technical challenges such as the quick camera shots was fantastic for the genre of the title. It made the film feel more action packed and tense. <br/><br/>To add, the electronic and acoustic soundtrack was beautiful to listen to because the notes were were written and played very well by the orchestra and computer. The soundtrack fitted well in a blockbuster action packed thriller. The sound was absolutely emotive. <br/><br/>In addition, the plot was supremely tense and gripping to the extent when I could not keep on track with my heart beats. Luc Beeson and Robert.M Kamen's imaginative script was definitely outside the box. The summary for the film: Bryan Mills reunites with his ex-wife and daughter on their holiday trip to Istanbul. All of a sudden, the family are stalked and hailed at serious danger by the Albanian Mafia who seek revenge. What makes me love 'Taken 2' is the fact that it related to the first movie but the only difference was that Kim Mills played by (Maggie Grace) had to return the favour by saving her father from dangerous Albanian mobsters who hailed him and his wife hostage in a secret location. It was horrifying to know the fact that Bryan and his wife Lenore were kidnapped and hailed hostage in a warehouse by the Albanian criminals. Not only that but 'Taken 2' was more brutal and less sensitive like 'Taken 1'. It soaked the movie with the thrill of tense bloody violent sequences like foot and car chases, massive shoot outs and explosions. The screenplay sucked in the theme family values and how the Albanians and the Mills' fought for their honour and survival. In my interpretation, Istanbul was a great place to shoot an action movie because of the Islamic culture, caved buildings, narrow alley ways and other Islamic elements which connects with architecture and culture. <br/><br/>As a conclusion, I will give Oliver Megaton's directed picture an 8/10."

This should be used by film schools everywhere as a textbook example of a bad sequel. <br/><br/>What I really hated: the daughter is, in fact, played by a 30 year old actress who happens to look 30. Overprotective Liam obsesses about her having a boyfriend (gasp!) and the impact it has on her all-important drivers test... Yet she drives like an F1 driver with a stick while dodging bullets in Istambul. <br/><br/>The writer-director also managed to relocate Albania and place it next to Turkey. <br/><br/>How people can pass through post 9/11 borders armed to the teeth.<br/><br/>And how it cheats the audience out of the fight scenes, real reason most of them were drawn to the damn thing in the first place. They are flash edited and incomprehensible, robbing any impact that would've made the stinking thing at least somewhat redeemable. <br/><br/>This is a bad, bad, bad movie.

When the father of one of the kidnappers swears revenge and takes Bryan and his wife hostage during their family vacation in Istanbul, Bryan enlists Kim to help them escape, and uses the same advanced level of special forces tactics to get his family to safety and systematically take out the kidnappers one by one.<br/><br/>The first Taken film came flying out of nowhere and surprised a lot of people with its success. Neeson himself has stated that he thought Taken would go straight to DVD. But it didn't and is now regarded as an action classic.<br/><br/>It was only inevitable that Taken would spawn a sequel, so now we have Taken 2. And as usual the questions were asked if this would rival the brilliant action and suspense of the first film. I myself had doubts that this would be as good, if not better than the Taken. The trailer was decent enough and the early buzz from independent critics was positive.<br/><br/>I've now seen the film. It's one of the worst films of the year. I'll go one further, IT'S ABSOLUTE GARBAGE!! Taken may very well have been destined for DVD hell, but did well enough to surprise everyone who saw it. Taken 2 does nothing but rehash the same formula, but without the gritty edge the first film had. So this time round Neeson and Famke Jannsen are taken and it's up to Kim (Maggie Grace) to rescue them. Big deal! This just didn't work for me. If the story were different, maybe excluding the wife and daughter altogether, then we could've done so many other things with Neeson's character. He could've been recruited by a billionaire to find his children or maybe take the Jack Bauer route and uncover a secret government conspiracy, which would still involve a lot of ass kicking and taking names. But we have this story with both him and his ex -wife, kidnapped by some Albanians and taken to some basement in Istanbul to await interrogation. So what happens? Nesson manages to escape, with his daughters help, leaving his ex -wife to fend for herself. He hatches a plan to go back and rescue his ex from the bunch of Albanian bad guys, who by the way, are seeking revenge against Neeson for killing their relatives in the first film. Madness!<br/><br/>Performances are OK. Neeson is picking up a paycheck so he doesn't look bothered. Famke Janssen just exists and throws in a few screams here and there. Maggie Grace as Kim is given a bit more to do this time round. I felt she did well to handle the physical aspects of the role. But now knowing she's a thirty-something year old woman playing a teenager, I wasn't convinced of her performances as I was the first time around. The standout performer is Rade erbedija, who is the best thing about Taken 2. Regardless of the poor script, he handles the dialogue brilliantly and the veteran actor makes his presence known as the main antagonist.<br/><br/>Taken 2 fails in so many areas – it's almost funny because the film plays like a sitcom at times. Dialogue is laughable, making constant references to the first film. The film drags for the first half hour and when the action finally does kick in, it's mediocre and shoddy. The fight scenes are also shockingly bad. Oliver Megaton, or Megatron as he's known, seems to have received his tutelage in direction from the Paul Greengrass School. Only difference is that Greengrass knows how to edit his fight scenes. It's all blurry action – you can hardly see what the hell is going on! Batman Begins suffered from the same thing. Thank God Nolan wised up. Megaton doesn't have a clue when it comes to filming action set pieces. He did the same thing with the awful Colombiana, which unfortunately found its way into Top 10 worst films from last year.<br/><br/>Taken 2 is an absolute disappointment! A poor story, crap script, mediocre action, shoddy direction, tired performances and it's longer than the first film.<br/><br/>Title for the most disappointing film of the year goes to Taken 2. Mind you, the critical reviews haven't hurt it's box office takings. Meaning they'll definitely be a Taken 3. Which is fine, as long as they up the viewing certificate back to 15 and get rid of Famke Janssen and Maggie Grace and give Leland Orser, who played the ex CIA computer wiz in the first film, more of a featured role in the next one. He was tragically wasted in this.<br/><br/>Avoid! Catch it on Netflix"

Plot is never at the top of the priority list for revenge-thrillers, so the bare-bones story can be forgiven; what can't go unnoticed though is the awfully clichéd dialogue (""We will have our revenge"" hisses the cardboard cut-out villain) and the muted action sequences. Seemingly out of puff, both the movie and Neeson's ex-CIA operative Bryan Mills meander along checking off the 'action-for-dummies' boxes, but never deliver any real pulse-racers.

","Taken 2
The movie Taken 2 was written by Luc Besson & Robert Mark Kamen, and directed by Olivier Megaton. It's a crime & thriller movie that was released in the year of 2012. In the movie, a retired CIA agent, Bryan Mills, played by Liam Neeson, saved his daughter from a kidnapping. Bryan, his daughter Kim, played by Maggie Grace, and his ex wife Lenore Mills, played by Framke Janssen, take a trip to Istanbul. The movie takes a turn when they run into Murad, played by Rade Serbedzija, who wants revenge on Bryan for killing his son while saving his own daughter.
Taken 2 has many components that help make the movie come together and become more realistic. The sound used in this film creates a very outstanding mood. There's a moment in the movie where Kim is on the phone with her father after he's been taken. The back to back interaction of dialogue in this scene combined with the natural sounds, and the background music make everything so intense that it seems so real. Another thing that stands out in this movie is the acting. The actors get so into their roles that you wouldn't even be able to doubt that that wasn't truly them. Liam Neeson who plays Bryan Mills has a very difficult and distinct role throughout the movie. Bryan used to be a CIA agent so he has an amazing set of special skills. Liam does an outstanding job with his role. He has the ability to do things that not many people can do in reality. This really helps make the movie more intriguing. Overall, The actors and actresses in this movie do a really good job of getting into character, and playing their roles.
The movie Taken 2 displays a great variety of costumes, setting, and makeup. The element of setting helps create an intense atmosphere throughout the movie. This movie is very action oriented so the location of a run down town really helps keep the movie rolling. The costumes and makeup in the movie help define the characters. Bryan does quite a bit of fighting throughout the movie which causes him to need special effects makeup. Taken 2 does a really good job of making sure the characters look like their roles.
Although Taken 2 was very nicely produced it will never be able to compare to the original movie in its series Taken. This movie was still written by Luc Besson & Robert Mark Kamen, but was directed by Pierre Morel instead of Olivier Megaton. The one thing Taken 2 is lacking is creativity. It has the same plot line as the first movie in the series. It needs something to make it stand out from the first one. When creating a sequel you want it to be better than the original. It can't be the same otherwise what's the point in making a sequel in the first place? It needs something different but similar to make it sound more intriguing. Something that will make people want to go to theaters to see it as soon as it comes out.
Overall, the movie Taken 2 was very nicely written and put together. It could use some improvement, but what movie doesn't. The movie does contain some violence; However, just enough that it keeps the movie still enjoyable. The movie is well throughout, action oriented and quite entertaining"
"tabuno","6","2","2","20 December 2019"," An Adequate One-Time Seen Action Thriller
","A rather underwhelming action thriller with long extended fight and chase scenes that we've seen before. One fight scene in a courtyard is rather bewildering and seemingly just choreographed to show off pretentious fighting instead of what would really be expected of a rather quick dispatch of single hand to hand combatants by Liam Neeson's supposedly superb fighting skills. Then there's the daughter who somehow becomes a repeated target while Neeson's colleagues at home seem to be just underused bystanders. The triangulation scene of locating hideouts was different, but still not quite completely flawless. The ending had potential but seemed to lose its fascinating impact. This is one of those movies that offers up some possibilities but really began to become struggle to watch for a second time through. In sum, an adequate one-time movie with some thrills but not something to keep around."

","Having moderately enjoyed, if finding some faults, the first 'Taken', part of me was hoping for a sequel along similar lines while still having some degree of freshness. Despite that it was reasonably poorly received and, although with notable exceptions, sequels tend to be inferior.<br/><br/>Count me in however as another person who was underwhelmed by 'Taken 2'. Not irredeemably awful and there are worse sequels about (naming them would take up a whole review's worth), but 'Taken 2' was a real waste of reasonable potential, considering that it has the always watchable and often very good to great Liam Neeson as the main star. Even those who don't expect much in the first place will find themselves having big problems with the film. Before anybody says anything, am not the sort of person who is always with the general consensus, have been known a fair few times to go against the tide and part of me wanted to do so watching this but the film was just too problematic to enjoy it more and take it for what it was.<br/><br/>'Taken 2' is not without good points. Neeson is a strong presence throughout, thoroughly badass yet with some heart. It's photographed slickly and stylishly, some of the imagery thrills and chills. <br/><br/>Music is a decent fit while not being intrusive. Some of the action is exciting and thrillingly choreographed, like with the rooftops, and again the violence is uncompromising without being too gratuitously so.<br/><br/>However, there are a lot of problems here. Only Neeson gives a halfway decent performance. Famke Janssen has next to nothing to do and doesn't look interested, while Maggie Grace's character was just too annoying and shallow for me to endear to Grace herself or resonate with the father-daughter relationship. Of which there is more of, but to me there was not enough heart or development to it. The rest struggle in very underwritten and stereotypical roles. 'Taken 2' fails to bring the best out of Turkey or make it the star or its own character, in fact it looks cheap and everything is represented in a fashion rife with lazy stereotypes.<br/><br/>Dialogue continues to lack clarity and be too over-the-top and the direction this time round lacks rawness and the same amount of momentum, pretty go-through-the-motions. It's the story that is the biggest failure. It is too much of a rehash of the first, except with a more fatigued pace, constant over-familiarity and even more ridiculous far-fetchedness and with wider lapses in logic and sense. Furthermore there is nowhere near the same amount of suspense or excitement. The climax is badly rushed and anti-climactic.<br/><br/>Overall, okay but rather tired. 4/10 Bethany Cox"

If they were in Mayberry that might work, but not in a city of 14 million people. Apparently it is possible to crash one's car through the front gates of the American Embassy (which is in the Turkish capitol Ankara, not Istanbul) and not be shot at, and furthermore, be allowed to walk away moments later!<br/><br/>The well choreographed and filmed action scenes from the original are reduced to shakycam and frenetic editing trying to distract from the crummy action-- bloody hell, what action?

","Spoilers ahead so beware******<br/><br/>The original Taken was a pretty refreshing back to basics popcorn movie about how far a father would go for his daughter. I loved the original & looked forward to this one. I thought it was going to be the sheik from the original relatives who would be exacting revenge, it turned out to be the sex slave peddlers relatives out for ""justice"".<br/><br/>OK let's get the bad stuff out if the way...<br/><br/>1.The Albanians speak English all the time.. In the 1st movie he had to hire a translator & important plot point in original hinged on the pronounciation of a certain phrase. In this they just chat in English to save the audience from reading subtitles.<br/><br/>2.I have never seen a stand off in a movie where the character in threat is allowed to make a phone call ... And the call is to warn the other person in danger.. They just kind of stand there and let him finish the call.<br/><br/>3.if kidnapping someone who has singlehandedly wiped out a small task force in the previous movie... Make sure you keep someone watching him & maybe search him and also use something stronger than plastic to tie him up. The boss essentially said to him ""you have half an hour to try and escape"" we are all going to leave and go upstairs to watch TV...""<br/><br/>4.As soon as Kim started driving the taxi , I knew the movie would end with her passing her driving test. Also she is an amazing driver under pressure , she should have easily passed 1st time.<br/><br/>5. What's the point in having secret agent friends if they never help you out when your in trouble... Surely they should have got a shot in this one to rescue their friend .. Instead all they got to do was eat barbecue and play golf. 5.1 On that note ,he tried to phone the agent friend at the beginning but couldn't get him... But at the end it turns out he had his mobile number. Why didn't he phone the US Embassy.<br/><br/>6. If Taken 3 gets made & one of the sons ends up to be Kim's boyfriend as suggested by others, it will make all the effort they went to track him down meaningless . I don't know if it was just me but the last scene I thought he was going to attack Brian , but they just had milkshakes & didn't seem too traumatised about the whole affair.<br/><br/>OK the good stuff...<br/><br/>Liam Neeson beating everyone up for 90mins ... It's worth it just for this.<br/><br/>All in all a sort of illogical film that was just made to grab more cash... I think the meeting went sort of like this...""How can we make a sequel to this standalone movie that's surprisingly made us a lot of cash?.....Hmm what if we make the main character get Taken this time...? OK that will do....that way we can still call it Taken.. Somebody get Liam on the phone.""<br/><br/>In saying all of this I still enjoyed the movie , it is what it is . A reasonable action movie pretty much carried the whole way by Liam Neeson, who would give Bourne a run for his money. (Character not movie) 6/10 for me.., nowhere near the original but still enjoyable."

If you love the story that Americans never die and with a small gun they can concur the world, take your flag and march to the movie theaters. It is also full of mistakes. The point of capture and point of torture is not the same however somehow our hero in the movie counts the seconds after his capture in Istanbul, a city with over 20 million people and one of the largest metropolises in Europe. His wife and himself are taken hostage at the European side and brought to a place in Asian side. A journey which usually takes an hour but our hero remembers every second, every turn and every sound of it. Secondly when a prayers comes (5 times a day and lasts for 2 minutes) from a mosque he uses this as one of the signs to remember where he was captured. Movie shows that prayers from the mosque never ends. Terrible acting, terrible script, terrible editing."

","Greetings again from the darkness. Four years ago ""Taken"" was a huge, surprise hit filled with heart-pumping action and a thrilling plot. The sequel boasts a budget more than three times the size of the original, the same key cast members (especially Liam Neeson), the same screenwriter (Luc Besson), and a similar type story. So why doesn't it work this time? The answer is inferior direction, no surprises, and too many absurd moments to count.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson returns as former CIA-stud Bryan Mills, father to Kim (Maggie Grace) whom he rescued from Albanian sex-traffickers in Paris. Famke Janssen also returns as Leonore, Kim's mother and Bryan's ex. Somehow, Leonore and Kim think it's a great idea to surprise Bryan with a visit while he is on a security job in Istanbul. Yes, right next door to Albania. Since the film opens with a mass funeral depicting the burial of all the guys Bryan killed in the first movie, and Rade Serbedzija vows revenge, it comes as little surprise when Bryan and Leonore are ""taken"".<br/><br/>What is surprising is that the filmmakers attempt to turn Maggie Grace into an action hero. Yes, gangly Maggie Grace who we saw hiding under the bed in the first film. This time, unable to pass the driving test to obtain her license, she transforms into master stunt driver and Olympic rooftop sprinter ... while deploying grenades with Swiss perfect timing. I should also mention that in real life Maggie Grace is 29 years old. She was supposedly 17 in the first movie and 18-19 here. Yes, one of my movie pet peeves.<br/><br/>In a film like this, we can always hope the action sequences cover-up the ludicrous script (see most Jason Statham movies). Unfortunately, we are abused with chopped up camera work that we often can't tell who is punching who are whose gun is firing. These action shots make the fight scenes in Batman Begins or the Bourne movies appear slo-motion. It's a waste of Liam Neeson and a potential stellar bad guy in Mr. Serdebzija (The Saint). The final irritant is Janssen's role as Leonore. She is reduced to sobbing and passing out (sometimes while wearing a hood). Just another waste.<br/><br/>There are two types of sequels: those that build on the best points of the first and those that simply cash in. Clearly, this one falls into the cashing-in column. Don't expect any long-lived quotes from this sequel. It has no particular set of skills. (www.MovieReviewsFromTheDark.wordpress.com)"

Making the villains as Muslims looks awkward, specially that there was no sign about that in the first Taken. In addition, Muslims don't name their kids with western names such as ""Marco""!!!!!!!. Simply, it seems that the film makers have problems with Muslims. and they wanted to make some non-reasonable changes to the plot.

"kuuk3","10","24","53","4 October 2012"," Excellent Film - A joy to watch
","This film was fantastic. <br/><br/>I loved the first film and it was a surprise breakout hit of the year. So when I heard a sequel was coming, I was there for the first showing in my local cinema. <br/><br/>As a sequel - it did have a problem of trying to put these ordinary characters into an impossible situation yet again. The first time you could imagine the circumstances behind the kidnapping and relate to the idea that this happens in the real world and it was spot-lighting a true tragedy in the world today. As a sequel, it couldn't repeat any of that without it looking copied or forced into the plot. The writers had to find a way of bringing the same cast back while tying it into the events of the last film somehow. While they did this superbly, it has to be said that the 'this might happen to your daughter' angle that the first film gave is not present in this film. This is more of an action driven showcase which is about the world these characters have created for themselves, not one they have been thrust into. <br/><br/>I was fine with this as it's a sequel - but some of the other reviewers on this site appear to have wanted a complete remake of the original - which this is most definitely not. It takes the elements that made the original outstanding and tries to build something new with them - which I applaud tremendously. <br/><br/>The use of intelligent spy work is still present. The mixed fighting styles, gun fights, car chases etc all still there making this a great film. The only thing really missing was the tying up of the mum / dad getting back together storyline that they started at the beginning but abandoned when it could have been acknowledged with a simply kiss at the very end of the film. <br/><br/>Because the first film showed us a new form of crime on the big screen that had not been explored before, and a whole criminal empire with a brand new action super spy to play with, it will forever be the best in the series - no matter how many sequels they make. But this film stands firmly up there with it as one of the best films of its year and you can be sure I will be first in line for the third film also when they undoubtedly make that also.<br/><br/>This film is already in my top 10 of favourite films of all time and I thank everyone who had a hand in making it a success."

","Bryan(Neeson) is in Istanbul, when suddenly, his ex and daughter show up... the combination of females and a foreign country immediately causes a villain(Serbedzija, who tries and fails to be particularly intimidating or memorable) to materialize(as well as a revenge story), and abductions occur. As you can probably already tell from what I describe, this goes for a more mainstream Hollywood feel(and if you make the ""brilliant"" counterpoint that it's made by Frenchmen, I will have to slap you... we're talking about the approach, it doesn't need to actually come out of the US), not daring to take chances, in spite of that being the strength of the first one(this one has a bit fewer surprises), presumably to ensure profits by being blander(and thus inoffensive). We now have scenes that we've seen before in this genre, playing out the way we'd expect them to. On the plus side, this does still keep the pace fast(if the energy dies out and is then revived somewhat, several times... it's already a tired premise, they really should have left it at just one movie), the rampant misogyny of the original is gone, the dark tone is maintained yet with a little humor(keeping it from being as unpleasant), based around the obsessive nature of our retired CIA operative lead. And the action is mostly good, sometimes great and intense. The so-swift-you-only-barely-perceive-it cutting is now reserved for the hand-to-hand combat, and there are more chases and shootouts, which get very dumb and boring at times. The female characters are written better, they feel like human beings. Lenore(Janssen) is no longer an insufferable bitch(this one can actually see things from her side!), and Kim(Grace) is downright active and important, not to mention that you can feel the mental scarring of the events of the '08 one, along with increased maturity and her still being an upbeat person(they also sexualize her, showing off Maggie's delicious bod... very Shannon, in that regard), and she does nice acting in it. The filming is not as solid with the loss of the director Morel(an expert cinematographer), and Megaton(badass name by the way) moves the camera excessively, causing the viewers to lose focus of where people are in relation to each other, taking us out of it. There is a lot of PG-13(because this is what you want 13-year-olds watching) violence and mild language and a tad of disturbing content and blood. I recommend this to those who want more of ""the same"", even if it's inferior. 6/10"

Granted, my expectations were low for this film, but I never imagined it could be this bad.<br/><br/>First off, If I started listing every stupid thing about this movie, this post would be 5 pages long. The biggest problem of the movie is that they couldn't even import the same action techniques from the first one. The action scenes are nothing but dozens of clips of people touching each other. The gunshots are so vague that sometimes you don't even realize a shot is being fired. Also, I want to know who was watching the first ""Taken"" and said, "" Man, that was great, but I'd like to see more of his daughter in the action."" Maggie Grace, who plays Liam Neeson's daughter Kim, is involved way too much in the story. The plot itself is laughable, but I still thought it could be entertaining. The father of one of the victims that Liam Neeson's character killed in the first film decides to exact revenge on him and his family in Istanbul. The movie spends way too much time on catching up with the Mill's family and focusing in on the kidnappers. Frankly, who really cares. All you want out of this movie is to see Liam Neeson tear some crap up, but it can't even deliver on that.<br/><br/>A good drinking game would be to drink every time something inconceivable happens in this movie. It would send the players straight for the emergency room. Another thing to note is that this movie takes itself way too seriously. There are no intended laughs in the script, which makes it all the less enjoyable. I can't remember the last movie that had be itching to run out of the theater.

I thought it was just okay (I have a review posted elsewhere) but hated the Kim character who came across as a totally brain dead teenager, and her mother as a calculated social climber.<br/><br/>I concluded my review by saying that another Taken should either not have the mother/daughter combo in it or else kill them both off in the first 20 minutes.<br/><br/>Sigh. They are both back and Kim is as whiney, petulant and stupid as ever. Can't even pass a drivers test in suburbia driving an automatic. The mother is having marriage issues so the solution to their disappointment is a holiday in Istanbul. Why not Hawaii, or the Gold Coast of Australia. The latter at least has 4 theme parks to keep poor Kimmy at her mental level of engagement, and a casino for Mummy. What did Istanbul do to deserve this duo?<br/><br/>Now I am not going to go over all the flaws in this movie; others have already done that in detail, and yes, it is an absolute clunker, but I cannot let the slanderous portrayal of Istanbul go without comment. I had the privilege of spending a week there two years ago as part of a cruise, and was bedazzled by the place. Only Prague and Budapest offer such variety IMHO. Turkey is at once both a modern and historical city and while largely Muslim it is home to many other religions including Christianity. It has managed this infusion of culture through secularism and progressive planning and development.<br/><br/>Why the producers chose Istanbul to make this lie of a movie beats me. Is it any wonder that the USA is seen by many other countries, including European countries, to be self-centred and dismissive of rich cultures and history far, far older than theirs? I think Hillary Clinton needs to apologise to the people of Turkey for the making and release of this drivel."

","nice joke my scores 10 . this is not Istanbul. a film made to discredit... Good job director Olivier Megaton you are a liar and loser. waste of time.I lived here for 20 years I've never seen such a city. '' Shots are fired in a hotel, grenades are detonated in a middle of a cosmopolitan city ...and there's no Police...

'' he's right .lie entirely a movie<br/><br/>''Unfortunately, it was disappointment because of scenario and directors. I noticed some main failure when I was watching. Firstly, writers should shame on them. (Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen) If you are doing a film which related at the real time, you can not create a new world. Why am I saying this ? Because ıf you know geography or if you used Google maps at least one time, you should know Turkey does not have border with Albania. Also I can say Turkey's border does not look like parking barrier. I mean you can not pass suddenly or when do you want. When the people who never saw İstanbul, watch the movie they can think what a worst place, because director showed the city like a 3th world countries' slum. I am living from 22 years in this city. I never saw this kind of covered women. It looked like Arabic county not Turkey I suggest to director, he should use also Google images. As everybody knows American movie sector likes to show action. However, the girl who daughter of CIA agent, bombing three grenades in the center of city where 13 million people living. Look at the luckiness no one coming. We are not talking about Somalia. Let's try shooting grenades and guns in Istanbul and count how fast special forces and police will be on your head. Also police is using car which used at 1970s. The production company says, we spent $45,000,000 for this film. I am not clear, why they used our 1970s polices' car at 2012. If you are not doing science fiction movie, you should scene of real life. Otherwise people can start to think they are doing on purpose. When I watched the movie, I remember the Midnight Express (1978). Also that film was in Turkey and ıt was showing in the same way. '' yes he/she is right"

Portray people's cultures as they are not as you like them to be seen. If Albanians want revenge they don't wait. they don't hold you captive not for a second. Also, in the end ""the father"" gives Liam his word that he is going to end ""it"" but picks up the gun and tries to shoot him?? That is so lame. When Albanians give their word they would die before they break it, everyone knows that. Also, I read the names of the cast members and there is not one real albanian playing a role, they are all turks. Anyway, based on the ending I am 100% sure there is a third coming.

","We meet up with Bryan as he meticulously obsesses and watches over everything involving his daughter Kim- who turned out to be quite the lovely girl. Apparently he still has nothing going on in his personal life. His ex is going through some marital troubles. When he goes to Turkey for work they join him there. Also in Turkey is the dad of one of the bad guys he killed in part 1. The bad guys are already tracking his moves there. When he leaves with the ex, they take him while she escapes. But eventually they take her as well.<br/><br/>Bryan, prepared for any eventuality has some mini phone with him that he uses to warn Kim, guide her out of the hotel and meet up. They escape the captors chasing them but he has to go back and get the ex, who of course isn't there anymore. He finds her nonetheless and her captor, the main bad guy.<br/><br/>Taken 1 was nothing revolutionary but was quite entertaining despite plenty of weaknesses. Rather than try to improve things, with Taken 2 things go markedly downhill. The positives first. Kim isn't annoying anymore, but rather watchable. Neeson who looked so fragile in part 1 like he was going to fall apart any minute looks healthier this time around and he's also very angry. But he doesn't really get to vent his anger enough. And the times he does, it's filmed so poorly the audience gets nothing out of it. Neeson at all times looks ready to blow up and wreak havoc, but we don't get to experience some cathartic mayhem. As most reviewers have pointed out, how the action is filmed is downright catastrophic for this kind of movie. So at at the end you are left with very little to like. This Olivier Megaton fellow is definitely the one you want to hire if you want to kill an action movie franchise. But decently filmed action still wouldn't have helped the lazy scriptwriting. The long setup at the beginning doesn't really work. It just builds some anticipation to an event that never happens. Aside from impossible aiming skills and a good memory very little is shown of Bryan's special skills. Taken 2 is a wasted opportunity."

It is so unrealistic that I waited during the movie when camels will appear on the streets, only they are missing!!! Of course there are slums and living areas for low income people in Istanbul too (like much of the modern cities in the world also Istanbul is a city where 13 million people live in) but this movie shows the whole Istanbul as a 3rd world country with bad intentions.

","The original Taken was excellent. We saw Liam Neeson enter a huge action role in the likes of Bond and Bourne, and gave us a surprising hit. It seemed inevitable that a sequel would be made. Despite still being entertaining and filled with some clever scenes, Taken 2 never quite reaches the same level as its original.<br/><br/>The reason the original Taken worked so well was that Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) was racing against the clock to find his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) in Paris after being kidnapped, giving him a reason to make quick decisions and pushing his boundaries with how far he'd go with violence and morality. In the sequel, the plot is pretty much the same, although he and his ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen) get taken instead of his daughter in Turkey. Essentially there's less mystery and suspense in this one as I feel the movie suffers due to its predictability and toned down violence for the PG-13/12 rating.<br/><br/>That's not necessarily a bad thing, though. Taken 2 works better as a popcorn movie than its original, having more action and car chases that keep you hooked at the movie's fast pacing once it gets going. The movie has some funny scenes, but there's also some stupid ones too which I will not spoil. I'm not sure if the movie's intention was to make fun of the original or not, but you'll notice the tone and humour of the movie is less serious than the original.<br/><br/>In conclusion, as much as I enjoy seeing Liam Neeson fight people in these movies, I don't think a third time will work with the exact same premise. In terms of entertainment and keeping me occupied, I'd give it an 8/10 for what it is. However, seeing another sequel for this might not be a good idea, but don't rule that option out!"
"blackmamba99971","10","8","17","15 October 2012"," Well here we go again
","Liam Neeson, the estranged father ex husband secret agent must now rescue his ex wife from the clutches of a revengeful Albanian insurgent. From the first movie, Liam simply rescued his daughter from an Albanian slave trader. This time he has to go through Albania itself through the corridors and the closed in city to find Lenore who was taken along with himself by the vengeful father of Mill's first victims. Murad Krasniqi (Rade Serbedzija) is the man who had kidnapped both Bryan and Lenore to make an example out of both of them, but mostly for Bryan because he killed Murad's son. Not wanting to hear excuses about kidnapping girls and slave trade them for money, Murad just wanted Mills to suffer by any length. Yet as for mills, his resourceful prowess to escape any cell or dungeon leads him along with the help of his own daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) who helps her father with a wild car chase through Albania's capital, plus the fact to have her come up with an ingenious way to find her father during his capture. I thought this was a great film to carry on the mills tradition of kicking ass, killing the bad guys, and just trash needless terrorist cells people can do without. The action was again top notch, the music fit the scene with the kind of espionage feel to it, and the fact with his trade hand to hand fight scenes always makes for a good final point. Liam Neeson is one of my favourite actors, he can always take any role which fits his persona. And this movie was no exception. High marks on the car chase, and gun play, as well as the fact that most will go to any lengths for revenge, even if it is in the shadows of the dark and gritty underground of slave trades or illegal arms deals. I felt that through the film, there were times you could actually feel the tension build up as Mills was trying to rescue Lenore, that the Albanians would use any trick to shake him off, but alas they were wrong. If a future film was to made, it should be made based on an earlier period in his career. Where a lone wolf is waiting and biding time to strike in order to bring him down. Maybe where he and Lenore first meet, and to retire from the secret service to becoming the famed celebrity protector we all know him to be. Recommended for those over the age of seventeen."
"caseymoviemania","1","19","50","2 October 2012"," Casey's Movie Mania: TAKEN 2 (2012)
","When the first TAKEN (2008) was shown in 2008, nobody would have thought that Liam Neeson could convince the viewers with his ""special set of skills"" (read: martial arts). But he did it very well, and the movie went on to become a surprise hit during that year. Now here comes the unnecessary sequel, which is obviously made to cash in the success of the first movie. Unsurprisingly, of course, TAKEN 2 is more of the same. Still, being formulaic can sometimes have its fun factor, as long as the filmmakers deliver the same intensity and excitement that the first movie had done successfully. However, the filmmakers behind the sequel can't even get the same thing right. Let's just say the result is seriously a lazy rehash with a capital ""L"".<br/><br/>This time around, the story involves the head of the Albanian clan named Murad Krasniqi (Rade Sherbedgia), who vows to avenge Bryan Mills' (Liam Neeson) killing of his son, the head of a human trafficking syndicate who was previously responsible for kidnapping Mills' daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace) in the first movie. His plan is to capture Mills, his separated wife Lenore (Famke Janssen) and Kim (Maggie Grace) and manage to track them down at Istanbul where they are there on a holiday.<br/><br/>While Kim chooses to stay over at the hotel to dip in the pool, Mills and Lenore goes out together. It doesn't take long before Mills starts to realize that they being followed and tries to outwit them. But no matter how precise and careful he tries, both he and Lenore end up being ""taken"" and now it's up to Kim to save the day.<br/><br/>So the ever-resourceful Mills, who hides a micro cellphone beneath his pants, manages to contact Kim and coordinate her escape. Of course, the rest of the movie won't be focusing solely on Kim to save the day (which I actually thought the filmmakers are bold enough to toy with the formula inside out) but we eventually see Mills break free from capture and uses his same ""special set of skills"" to overcome the bad guys.<br/><br/>The biggest problem about TAKEN 2 is the replacement of the original director Pierre Morel with Olivier Megaton (the man behind the awful TRANSPORTER 3 and the surprisingly entertaining COLOMBIANA). Just as you thought he does improve significantly in term of his overall direction in COLOMBIANA, he does the impossible in TAKEN 2. It's like watching TRANSPORTER 3 all over again. His direction is listless and he has no sense of pace. The first 15 to 20 minutes alone is a tired slog that seriously needs to be trimmed down a lot. I mean, it's understandable that Robert Mark Kamen and Luc Besson's script is trying to inject some character-driven family drama here to develop more on Bryan Mills, Kim and Lenore. But their execution is terribly long-winded and frankly, too melodramatic for its own good.<br/><br/>Even when the action does finally arrive, it's sad to see that Megaton chooses to film the scene with his trademark shaky camera-work and whole lots of haphazard editing that it's frustrating to see what's going on. The hand-to-hand combat scene is especially a huge letdown, with surprisingly boring martial-art choreography all over the place. Whether it's me or the fact that Liam Neeson is looking less agile and tired when comes to action scene. Perhaps he's too old to commit a lot of physical movements like he did so well two years ago. But whatever the reason is, the action is awfully pedestrian and there's hardly any sense of urgency at all. Even the movie's car chase scene in the middle part feels generic.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson remains a saving grace here, but that isn't really saying much. Overall, you can say his role is sadly wasted here. Meanwhile, Maggie Grace is obviously too old to play a 19-year-old teenager (she's actually 28!) and spends most of the time either looking worried or sad. Famke Janssen delivers a thankless performance here, while veteran Rade Sherbedgia, who is no stranger to villainous role, is as lifeless as a piece of wooden plank.<br/><br/>With a reportedly high budget of an estimated $80 million to make, TAKEN 2 looks like a low-rent, B-grade trash you might found in the bargain bin. No doubt TAKEN 2 is one of the worst sequels ever made for an action thriller. Hopefully this will be the last of it.<br/><br/>http://caseymoviemania.blogspot.com"

","""Taken 2″ feels far too much like a franchise film, loses all the edge of your seat impact of the original, filled with clichés dialogue and contains rather predictable plot line. The result is a below par attempt to recreate the excitement of the original and the conventional and boring final 30 minutes did not help the proceeding.<br/><br/>""Taken 2″ cashes in on the same concept that made the first film a sleeper hit, despite its modest budget. However, this film loses the audience minute by minute, when it should have an edge of your seat thriller. French director Olivier Megaton (who previous worked with Luc Besson on ""Transporter 3"") along with the script writing duo (Besson and Robert Mark Kamen ) are both key accomplices for the sequel failure to excites or entertain. It must be admitted that the film is well structured from the opening minutes and even manages to sustain an adequate level of suspense for a good 50-60 minutes, but from then on, it all goes to hell. In fact the film is filled with unintentional humour and constant unnecessary referral to the first film, making it almost impossible to take the situation seriously.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson is one actor that never fails even when everything else besides him falls apart. He tries extremely hard to keep the film afloat and have a good enough revengeful screen presence to attain the audience attention. However, at times, even Neeson's intense look can seem a little repetitive and combining with a lacklustre script and plot line, the result is a rather cliché and predictable final 30 minutes of bore- fest. Maggie Grace reprises her role as the daughter in the original film, but here she is not given enough material to work on. At times, Grace just seems lost within the chase and unsure of where her character needs to be. Famke Janssen adds nothing to the proceeding as she spend most of her time either kidnapped or in a black bag wrapped around her face. Perhaps the biggest issue of all comes in the form of the villainous role played by veteran Rade erbedija, who is neither menacing nor interesting for the audience to feel the full effect.<br/><br/>I have always been a keen admirer of Luc Besson's body of work, while he can be a hit and miss; there is always something in his films that makes it slightly different to the usual Hollywood. His recurring themes of human degradation and the brutal nature of humanity provides a different take on Hollywood action cinema. While the original ""Taken"" explores the tried and true issue of human trading and forced prostitution, this film does not seem to have any particular focus and the end result is seemingly coming down to an vengeful factor that is never truly explored. While the first film director Pierre Morel (a keen cinematographer), provides a sharp and constant edgy look that makes the film such a success, Megaton lacks this crucial ability and in turn moves the camera so often that the audience is unable to focus on the action on display.<br/><br/>All in all, ""Taken 2"" is one of those films that try too hard to follow the same premise, tricks and plot line as the original. However, the film lacks a decent script, an important issue, a crucial focus and sharp and edgy direction that is required to make this kind of film clicks. Looking on the brighter side, the film does start pretty convincingly and even manages to sustain the audience attention for a good hour, but from that point onwards, it is essentially a cliché and predictable bore-fest.

","Wow its Taken 2 can't wait to go to the movies and watch it.<br/><br/>I loved Taken and this is going to be the best sequel ever with Liam Neeson i can't go wrong.<br/><br/>Watched the movie - Utter Rubbish!!!<br/><br/>This film is so ridiculous, do they think we are all living in the dark ages and know nothing about Turkey?<br/><br/>This film has so many flaws, i am the big liam neeson i can dodge 1000 bullets, i am bruce lee i can beat up 20 guys at once<br/><br/>This was complete rubbish.<br/><br/>I am the big liam neeson i use Grenades as GPS, just a few grenades and i can tell u where i am by counting the seconds it takes to hear explosions and drawing circles on a map. It is so silly and annoying.<br/><br/>This film is so bad he tries, the bad guys are so cheesy its insane.<br/><br/>Then the girl who is learning to drive, uses an old fashioned gear stick lever car in a massive chase scene, there is no way she would be able to drive a car at that speed and that skill and she hasn't even passed her test. it was so silly.<br/><br/>Not to mention the drive through to the US embassy shooting soldiers destroying the barriers and driving through security. One simple phone call to a man on a golf course and they walk free. Yeah right , you would held for at least 48 hours for that and still be detained.<br/><br/>For idiots this is a good movie.<br/><br/>For the adult audience with a brain this movie is so silly.<br/><br/>Avoid it is complete rubbish!!"

","Taken 2 is a brilliant genre film. The film-making is of the highest order, every moment is used to its fullest potential; the suspense and action is breath-taking and always graceful. Olivier Megaton proves, as was clear in Colombiana, that he has outstanding talent when it comes to staging and filming action and involving the audience with the story and characters. <br/><br/>This is the continuation of Taken and what is enjoyable is the way the story follows the first film and continuity is kept. In some follow-up films familiarity breeds contempt but the actors are all sympathetic and believable; a light touch to a potentially heavy sequel. <br/><br/>Liam Neeson deserves special praise as the film's success rides on his charisma and physical presence, needless to say he is perfect, bringing to mind Gary Cooper in High Noon, famously Cooper seemed to not be acting he underplayed so well, Neeson is the same here, the less he tries to win you over, the less he does, the more you like his character. <br/><br/>The thing that really makes Taken and Taken 2 work is the nightmare quality to the central character's story, like in a nightmare things keep going wrong and drawing him back into a paranoid state, as if he were being haunted by the obsession of his daughter or loved ones being kidnapped and unable to ever truly relax and live a normal life, that's why the film manages to be truly scary and suspenseful; because we feel what he feels."

","That's what it felt like after I'd watched less than half an hour of this risible nonsense. The first one was bad enough, but for some reason I was drawn back for more. The vague expectation, perhaps, that there might be an improvement here. Sadly, no. If anything, it was worse.<br/><br/>Where do I start? Teenager script, 1-dimensional characterisation, clunky acting, clichéd action scenes... says it all, really.<br/><br/>I usually get narked with people who talk and text in the cinema, and there was more than the usual share of both at the showing I went to. But I couldn't blame these people. It got to the point where anything - even checking the latest FaceBook updates - offered a more interesting and rewarding way to spend the evening.<br/><br/>Why does Liam Neeson do it?

","Perfect film! I was hooked from start to finish. I hadn't seen the first Taken film but that didn't ruin the experience. It was easy to understand from the start. Bryan is extremely clever. He doesn't need all the gadgets and gizmos that other action heroes need. Yeah he has guns but not fancy ones made especially for his palm print and all that. More than anything he needs his brain and he uses it well. I want this on DVD because it was exciting, different and cleverly written. I'm officially a big Taken fan! The film was perfect!

"chaz-28","4","6","13","5 October 2012"," The story is a bit laundered and rinsed from the original, everything is merely imitation
","Released in 2008, Taken came out of nowhere to earn $145 million at the box office on just a $25 million budget. The movie-going public recognizes fresh material when they see it. Taken was original, creative, driven, and hosted one of the most memorable protagonists in recent memory. Of course they would have to make a sequel to wring some more money out of Taken's fans.<br/><br/>A review of a movie sequel which starts outs praising the first installment instead of the new story is most likely not going to be very kind to the unfortunate title which ends in the number 2. Taken 2 keeps Liam Neeson as Bryan Mills, Famke Janssen as his ex-wife Lenore, and the always relentlessly annoying Maggie Grace as his daughter Kim. Rule of thumb - if Maggie Grace is cast in your film, it will probably stink. This is her second feature film in 2012, after Lockout, so she is 0-2 this year. The bad guys are also mostly the same; they are the extended family of the first group of Albanians Bryan killed after they kidnapped his daughter and sold her into sex slavery. Now they want revenge; they must honor their dead sons and brothers. It doesn't matter that their sons and brothers were human traffickers, rapists, and murderers. Family honor is family honor ya know? <br/><br/>Bryan is growing close with his family again. After a few days of work in Istanbul as a heavily armed bodyguard, Byran invites Lenore and Kim to Turkey to take in the sights and relax in a very posh hotel. Fortunately for the Albanians, this is where they are going to kidnap Bryan, transport him back to Albania, and torture him to death. The introduction of mom and daughter is a cherry on top for the head bad guy Murad (Rade Serbedzija). He is older with grey hair; I mention this because all of the other couple dozen bad guys run together, he is the only one you will remember. In Taken, Bryan had it comparatively easy. He had one person to save and could methodically move through the ranks of thugs as he stabbed and shot his way to the top. Now, not only does he have to watch his own back, he must save both mom and daughter, sometimes alternating which one he can help at any given moment.<br/><br/>The original Taken was so good because of Bryan's practical and purposeful methods of extracting information, Neeson's deadpan delivery, and the ins and out of seedy Paris locales. Now take everything which made Taken a great movie and divide it by two. You already know the story, you know Bryan will talk slowly and concisely about how he has certain skills, and this time you get to suffer a bit more because Maggie Grace gets more screen time. The camera work also takes a nosedive during hand to hand combat. The camera shakes, jumps up and down, does some jumping jacks, and the average edit is probably .002 seconds. The audience has no hope of logically following who is punching whom or where a new bad guy springs up from. Scenes where Bryan fights with a loaded pistol are much easier to watch.<br/><br/>It's not that I'm mad at writer Luc Besson or director Olivier Megaton; they probably were under a lot of pressure to re-create the Taken magic. Unfortunately, they did not do a very good job. The story is only a bit laundered from the first one and everything else is merely imitation. Stay away from Taken 2, it will only remind you of its superior predecessor."

How can Hollywood dump this much money into a story as flimsy as this is way beyond me. It must be just spoiled rich people who don't have a clue about the value of money. There are countless other ways to spend $45 million dollars. To make matters worse, I just saw The Expendables 2 yesterday on video and had the same painful experience. The Expendables 2 had a $90 million budget, so that's nearly $150 million dollars on 3 hours of wasted life on the audiences behalf. Why even bother, Hollywood thinks that they are the good guys but the truth is that there is way too much money floating around in the wrong hands that could be getting spent on making better some of the countless things that make life difficult for humankind."

Black shadows, a mini skirt and a turban-wearing, everyone is free. American soldiers do not like the movie never barricade at the American Consulate. I laughed at one of the scenes is very fitting. It's been the image of the country's war. The film was taken from carefully selected sites. Apparently carefully chose to call all the old and mediocre places. As a woman living in Istanbul, I'm sorry.To discredit the movie pulled my country. Despite all those explosions do not have the police in the middle.

"osterhoutj_2","1","3","5","8 October 2012"," Complete Disappointment
","I was so excited at the idea of a Taken sequel that I hadn't occurred to me at how bad it could end up being; unfortunately this movie is a perfect example of how lightning typically doesn't strike twice.<br/><br/>In Taken you felt as though you were with Bryan Mills while he slammed through Europe utilizing his ""particular set of skills"" to track down his kidnapped daughter, Kim. You could feel his sense of urgency and anger throughout the gritty film that was strongly written by Luc Beeson and well directed by Pierre Morel. Every situation Mills found himself in and got himself out of was realistic enough to believe and kept the audience captivated, not distracted.<br/><br/>All of those things that made Taken great were basically ignored in Taken 2. For the most part, the script was filled with lame/cheesy dialog, ridiculous action sequences (see the car chase for examples of both) and completely unrealistic situations (see the scene in which Kim finds her parents via rooftops and grenades). It seemed as though Luc Beeson, whom I very much enjoy usually, mailed in this script for a quick paycheck banked on the success of the original. There were so many poor attempts at humor between Mills and Jamie, Kim's boyfriend, that the movie would have been better off allowing actor Jon Grimes, one of Mills' ex-agent friends, to reprise his Uncle Rico role from Napoleon Dynamite. At least that would have been funny.<br/><br/>In the end, I will continue to watch my Taken DVD while attempting to block out the fact Taken 2 was ever made and find comfort in knowing Luc Beeson said this would be the only sequel."

","Taken 2 is the sequel the highly successful Taken, and stars Liam Neeson, Maggie Grace and Famke Janssen who reprise their roles as Bryan, Kim and Lenore. <br/><br/>Taken was probably one of the best films to release in 2008. It caught everyone off guard in terms of it's rave reviews. Liam Neeson was fantastic in it. But I'm sad to say the sequel is nowhere near as good. Neeson, as much as I hate to say it, wasn't too good in this. A lot of scenes did not make any sense, and even though it is only 90 minutes long it felt longer. It was an unnecessary sequel which shouldn't have even been thought up of. The mere concept of it was stupid. However, that didn't stop me or the flocks of other people to not see it. <br/><br/>There were a few cool scenes, but they were mostly faltered by poor story telling and mindless actions by characters. This film wasn't all bad, it was good for the first while, although there is a lot to complain about. It's not the best thing to come out in 2012. But it's far from the worst."

","Taken 2 was an outstanding film. Filled with lots of action, fast cuts, and the usual things that make good action films. But what separates this from the rest is Liam Neeson's amazing role within the film as Bryan Mills, and the vast amount of explosions that occur, and there are some tense part too.<br/><br/>It was just as good as the first, if not better. Usually when film bring a sequel out they're not as good as the first, and possibly even ruin the first film from the second one. But after watching the action-filled 91 minutes, it has truly got to be one of the greatest action films of 2012.<br/><br/>There are many twists and plots within the film, that make it even more immense, and I truly do hope that they make another film to this series to make it a trilogy."

"Joshwahr","7","5","11","7 October 2012"," Disappointed, but expected.
","Let's get this out of the way now. Taken is my favourite film. Ever. So I went into Taken 2 to with expectations; they'd have to up the ante, and not destroy the brand.<br/><br/>Taken 2 sits somewhere in the middle of that. The first half of the film tries to build on the characters of Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson), estranged wife Lenore (Famke Janssen), and daughter Kim (Maggie Grace). This half of the film really works, investing you in the characters, even if there are few holes here and there. It really gets you feeling for the characters when the action gets going. Sadly when the action does kick in, it doesn't deliver. New director Olivier Megaton (Transporter 3, Colombiana), who has taken over from the brilliant Pierre Morel, directs with the subtlety of a brick thrown at a glass window. From poorly executed shots, to overly shaky camera work & way too many cuts, the violence and shock of these actions seen in Taken 1 is lost in this film. This also probably has to do with the producers' choice to lower the rating from MA15+ to M15 (or PG13 in America). Their reason for this is to ""broaden the audience"", but seeing as the first one is so violent and how you need to see the first one to understand what the hell is going on in Taken 2, this is a stupid move as the kids watching won't be allowed to see the first! Another thing which really bugged me was the colour grading; when Bryan was with his family it was nice and bright, but when we were with the villain (Rade Serbedgia), the film had this overly dark grey look to it which just said ""HE'S A GOOD GUY AND HE'S A BAD GUY!!!""<br/><br/>I wasn't expecting much from director Olivier Megaton, whose only other films, The Transporter 3 and Colombiana, both of which are pretty average. But I was expecting a lot more from Luc Besson as producer and writer. I enjoyed the first half of the film, it showed love for the original and really built on the characters, perhaps too much. But sadly I was incredibly disappointed with the second half which was poorly executed and left me thinking ""Really? Is that it?""<br/><br/>7/10"
"pariah01","9","5","11","7 October 2012"," Action as promised. Nothing more. Nothing less.
","Being a big fan of the first film, I rushed to see the sequel right away. I was a tad worried that it didn't have the same director as the first film, but I'm relieved to see that its a sequel worthy, albeit slightly inferior, to its predecessor.<br/><br/>Borrowing from the format established in the first film, Mills attempts to live an ideal family lifestyle that's apparently still picking up the pieces since the incident in the first film. However, as they all labor to heal, the relative stability is compromised by a combination of his job and a vengeful group of Albanian criminals. What follows is a very entertaining exhibition of Mills' ""skills"" throughout a lower class portion of Istanbul.<br/><br/>What makes this film slightly weaker than the first film however, is an underdeveloped, if less profound enemy the conflict with which is marred by a frustratingly shifty camera. The first film not only highlighted the bad-assity and heartening fatherly instinct of Bryan Mills, but also served to expose some of the criminal and multicultural problems that are very real throughout Paris and, in fact, all of Europe. Slave trade in and from the west is prevalent and not often spoken of. The fact that Taken was willing to tackle the subject, as well as the controversies that surround it, made the film especially deep, if peripherally so. Between an intruding group of Albanian criminals with misogynistic cultural values and a callous ""business"" man protected by corrupt and apathetic law enforcement, the first film ran the full gamut of the problems involved in combating slave trade in Europe. What's more, it gave the audience a stake in the conflict: this time around, with the disgusting enterprise having affected an American family from a less tumultuous culture, people start caring a lot more. Complementing this message was a shameless display of masterful detective work, profiling, and well choreographed chases and fight scenes.<br/><br/>Taken 2, by comparison, feels slightly more myopic, if not watered down on exactly what the conflict is and what causes it. With the antagonists of the film being blood-related to the antagonists of the first film, this story is clearly compounding the precipitating aspect of the multiple sources of conflict from the original movie: Albanian slave traders. While it's not clear that the Albanian relatives are slave-traders in kind, they clearly share the same cultural origins--which are pointedly Islamic. As such, with the exception of a few corrupt officials here and there, this film tends to concentrate on the runners of organized crime rather than the overseers who were given some more emphasis in the first film. With the scope being so narrow, there's less aspects of their criminal behavior covered, and thus an apparent loss in story. But in the film's defense, it had to trim the leaves to give more definition to the revenge-driven values of the criminals and their culture. To that end, the audience is treated to a clash between not merely organized crime and a loving father/husband, but also of moralities that very clearly differ. On one hand, you have a group of individuals driven by grief, anger, and the desire for satisfaction--characterized, not in so many words, by the undeniable description of an honor killing directed at an imprisoned Mills--whereas on the other hand, you have an individual totally concerned with mowing down baddies for the sole purpose of defending his family.<br/><br/>Adding to this juxtaposition of cultural values is a not-so-subtle double exposure going on in the background. Turkey is an Islamic but ultimately secular country with a secular culture. But the chosen setting for the film, Istanbul, is a symbolic reference to the tremendously relevant artifacts of the nation's Islamic past. Islam and its relevance in this war of ideologies isn't directly confronted by the protagonists or the film's general narrative, but the visual nuances of the film for the intercultural conversation taking place in the city certainly bring it to the fore. Various times, between points of plot advancement, the sky view camera does flyovers of the Sultan Ahmed Mosque that felt meaningful but surreptitious at the same time. Mills and his family are seen fairly often in crowds as the only westerners making their way through a sea of Burqas. More than once, the camera focused on the crescent and star symbol most particular to the Muslim religion--and, incidentally, bears a strong resemblance to the crescent and star gang-symbols tattooed on the hands of the Albanians. Then we have the history of Istanbul itself, formerly known as Constantinople, a capital of Christianity (even amidst multiple regime changes) for 1100 years prior to being invaded, pillaged, and forcibly converted to Islam, its crowning cultural and architectural achievement the Hagia Sophia converted to a Mosque. Each of these much seen but rarely spoken of qualities within the film carries an embedded meaning addressing the underlying premise of 'Westerner preserving his livelihood in the midst of ideological tyranny by Islamic gang bangers'.<br/><br/>Taken 2 is, above all else, a visual piece. If the film isn't busy demonstrating Mills' archetypal picket-fence family, then it's contrasting his family life with that of the antagonists as they bury their dead in a formal Islamic ceremony that's concluded with a declaration of vengeance. If the camera isn't taking in the sites of Istanbul, then it's glorifying Mills' ability to track down and dispense Albanian gangsters with extreme prejudice. This arrangement works to its favor since the dialogue is more often than not an oversight to the action of the film.<br/><br/>Anyone who liked the first movie will assuredly have some appreciation for the second. While you can't say the subject matter in the second film is as widely relevant, or as readily apparent, as the itinerary of the first, it still carries a certain profoundness. And that profundity serves as an adequate side-dish to the main course of action sequences."

","""Taken 2"" (2012) is the first sequel to ""Taken"" (2008) and another fighting-jammed, adrenaline-filled action movie. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:<br/><br/>One of the biggest issues with Taken 2 is not its content, but how it has been portrayed and treated in mainstream and social media. At face value, Taken 2 is an okay action movie - not great, but not particularly bad either. The movie does have a few problems and inconsistencies as action sequels often does, but they are not as prevalent and ""in your face"" as one might think.<br/><br/>Content-wise, this movie is packed with violence and fighting like the first Taken. However, it is less impactful and personal compared to the first installment, and thereby doesn't carry the same emotional weight. It is not nearly as dark as its predecessor as well, as Taken 2 revolves mostly around revenge and not international women trafficking. The editing is very choppy at times, but not as bad or nauseous as social media sometimes portrays it to be. Throw stereotypical judgement aside, and this movie will instantly become more enjoyable.<br/><br/>My personal grade: a decent 7/10. If you found this helpful, check my profile for more reviews."

"MiloXC-HD","4","2","3","6 December 2012"," I had high expectations and felt really let down. If you loved the first one, don't expect much from this.
","Full review at: http://miloponsford.blogspot.co.uk/2012/11/taken-2-review.html (Please see :))<br/><br/>It is written by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen and directed by Olivier Megaton, the writers and directors from the Transporter films with Jason Statham and The Fifth Element with Bruce Willis. With this in mind, I had pretty high expectations in terms of action and explosives and fighting scenes and was looking forward to a thrilling, tense plot. I wanted to be hooked by Neeson's cold vengeance and wanted to be shouting and egging on Neeson to break some bad guy's neck, but left the cinema feeling pretty disappointed.<br/><br/>The first thing I would like to critisise is the chemistry between the characters; I felt very little between Bryan (Liam Neeson) and his wife, Lenore (Famke Janssen), and child, Kim (Maggie Grace). It felt like a poor romantic film and although the characters were trying to look like a struggling family that rely on each other, I couldn't help but sit there in the cinema and think ""BOOORRRRIIINNNG! Come on, Neeson, kill some people already!"". I didn't feel any link between the characters and the audience and didn't feel sympathetic for any of the characters, except one...Murad (Rade Serbedzija), the main enemy! At the end he seemed like a helpless old man who just wanted peace and I felt kinda sorry for him when Neeson bluntly killed him. I wanted to watch Taken 2 to feel no sympathy for the bad guys but I felt the opposite!<br/><br/>I also didn't like Bryan's style and method of killing in this film; cold, blunt kills. In Taken, Neeson ruthlessly tortures and murders his victims with a variety of techniques (e.g. electrocution). In Taken 2, however, he simply kills the majority of them with a single bullet or two to the chest which was blunt and boring. He clearly wasn't sympathetic (I've said that word a lot already) for anyone and was too tired to play games and just wanted to get home with his family, so he simply pulled the trigger at anyone that stood in his way (yes; by anyone, I mean policemen, too!)<br/><br/>The fighting wasn't great either. In Taken we see a range of hand-to-hand intense combat scenes but in the sequel we only see one or two good ones. They were pretty average, too; nothing like the scenes from the Ip Man films or anything similar! The sounds were dull thuds and there was usually no music, so these fighting scenes were just terribly awkward. I just sat there looking around the screen instead of shouting ""COME ON BRYAN! PUNCH HIS TEETH OUT!"". Ah, yes, the music; was really badly used in some scenes. For example, when a bad guy gets out the car there is lots of high tension music, but all he does is go through a door way and then the film switches to another situation.<br/><br/>I also thought it was a bit crazy how his daughter hadn't even passed her driving test yet but was able to drive through tight streets at high speeds and do impressive drifts in a taxi that I could only dream of doing in my Capri! I guess I was paying attention to detail, but it still annoyed me. I think the fact that she hadn't passed her driving test was only added in to build sympathy and acted as another teenage connotation.<br/><br/>The plot matched Neeson's style of killing; simple and fast and wanted to be done already. I bet I could sum it up in one sentence; ""Bryan and his wife are captured as revenge for Bryan's killing in Taken, and his daughter releases him so he can get revenge on his victim's avengers, then they can enjoy a soppy, unromantic holiday."" Easy!<br/><br/>Did Neeson kick some ass as we were expecting? Well, yeah, I guess...nothing hugely entertaining but he did kill a lot of people. Did Olivier Megaton make a good film? No, not really. I wasn't sure if it was a cheesy romance-thriller or a dull action film. I had high expectations and felt really let down. If you loved the first one, don't expect much from this. Don't get me wrong; I really love Neeson and think he is a great actor, but he's certainly winning no Oscar from this film.<br/><br/>4/10"
"darthmatthew-442-606491","3","2","3","1 December 2012"," Not a train wreck, as that would imply that there was something to wreck in the first place
","My self-appointed duty to review movies has always brought to me great moments of joy. Moments where my search of excellent film has lead to fruitful experiences such as A Separation, cuddling me with the soft warmth of the art of film. And then there are movies like Taken 2, which grab me from the warmth and slam my head against a wall while screaming in my ear. Movies that I wish I had passed by and never given a second glance, but alas, I do my best to leave no stone unturned.<br/><br/>Taken 2 was such a departure from all that was good and holy from the first installment, that it had me walking out of the theater baffled, wondering, ""Where on earth did this go so wrong?"" They were both written by the same person. Most of the cast was the same. The only real change was the director, who didn't do a necessarily bad job. The scapegoat, then occurred to me--cash. This movie, simply shouldn't have been made, and whatever idiot who proposed this movie, should have a talk with Bryan Mills. This isn't even a train wreck. A train wreck would imply that it had a direction in the first place; however, there was no train to derail.<br/><br/>The writing was a disaster. Way to many liberties were taken in the story for the sake of the plot, and yet they still managed to botch that up too. It was too convenient the way the villains acted as if the writers wanted to keep certain options available just in case they were needed later, and so characters making weird and non-sensical decisions for the sake of extending the story. As a result, a plethora of plot holes began to mar an already pointless and confused plot. And I'm not saying ""confused"" as in ""confusing"", as it was mostly followable. No, I'm saying the very characters in Taken 2 seemed like they had no clue what they were doing. They were just wandering around killing people, because hey, Liam Neeson killing people is cool, right? Not this time, go figure.<br/><br/>The first Taken had some of the most intense, gritty fight scenes to every be shot. But in the spirit of most sequels, Taken 2 decided that the brilliant editing technique that made Taken fight scenes congruent wasn't for them. So instead, I was treated to a mash-up of incomprehensible, seemingly unrelated motions that caused me to put my hands up in defeat. A shot of a swing, a shot of a knife being picked up. A shot of a gun being fired. A shot of another swing. A shot of a guy dying. How does this relate? It was almost like in the editing bay they were playing a game where they tried to unscramble the order of the shots, but they left for a coffee break and forgot to finish it. Normally I don't ever feel a need to mention editing. But the errors made in Taken 2 were so blaring and elementary I simply couldn't ignore them. And it wasn't just the fight scenes. Errors were also prevalent in the chase scenes, destroying all congruency. In a couple of shots, they be in one room. Then they're shown leaving the building. Then all of a sudden they're in a room again as if they never left in the first place. It begged the question, ""Where are they?"" followed shortly by, ""Why are they here?""<br/><br/>There was no meaning to this at all; no ideas to drive the story. Taken 2 was a prime example of lazy contemporary film making. They thought by adding some new family conflicts and character motivations it would make it interesting, under some misconception that it will make the movie ""deep."" They should have referred to the K.I.S.S. principle, ""Keep It Simple Stupid!"" All is meaningless without a meaning for it. It simply proved to distract from the rest of the story, though I suppose there was nothing to distract from."

"steveneomois","2","2","3","14 October 2012"," Nothing special
","I did not see the first movie, which I heard was quite good. My review will be simple - what I liked and what I didn't. <br/><br/>What I liked: The idea of the daughter helping Liam Neeson escape was predictable, but I liked it. Good to see her justify being in the movie. Liam Neeson was mostly likable. He really tried to do a good performance, succeeding, in my opinion, with the movie's best, but the script didn't help him much. Liam giving instructions to his daughter by phone was also interesting. There were some good landscapes of Istanbul.<br/><br/>What I didn't like: There's a lot. Firstly, the story was bland and very predictable. As I understand, a copy of the first movie. Secondly, the characters - nearly all of them - were laughable and childish. What's worst, they acted like idiots, especially the ""you can't possibly escape; your death will be slow; we'll politely chain you in our basement without guards and chase you around for hours later shaking our heads etc."" terrorists. Neeson's ex-wife and daughter had no character. You'd expect the daughter to be traumatized, but she was only slightly shaken and fully recovered in the end of this film, where, basically, the exact same thing happens as in the first. I wouldn't! And she didn't even tell her boyfriend about it: romantic, eh? Thirdly, the police are just as stupid as in your average low-budget thriller flick. Istanbul basically explodes, and they barely notice. Terrorists kill cops, guards and more, they just sit and watch. The U.S. embassy is embarrassing as well: they basically have an army in the city (what???), but they don't help Liam at all. But what's worst: our hero is a cold blooded murderer! He repeatedly shoots his enemies and even cops when he clearly has other options, he says it himself. I felt no sympathy for any of our main characters, in fact I was hoping for the ex-wife and daughter TO DIE, just so I could see some more emotion from Liam and perhaps even feel sorry for him. At the end, he kills the main bad guy (who only wanted revenge for the death of his sons, overreacted revenge, I agree, but at least I understood his motives)when he clearly shouldn't, and thus triggers the revenge of the terrorist's other sons and a third movie, like he says himself. At times, the movie seems to be making fun of itself, in specific the so-called Dead henchmen problem. The action is horribly shot - the jump-cuts gave me a headache. Seriously, there's like 300 shots per minute, all separated by insane jump-cuts. How is this even possible? Half the time, I couldn't understand what was going on. And the romance between Neeson and his ex- wife: painful. Especially the dialog. When they try to be sarcastic but fail miserably.. ugh. The plot is just bad.<br/><br/>But, if you really like to see Liam Neeson beat people, even if it's horribly shot, give it a go."

Yes, slave traders love their children too. In the US, the action takes place at some time in the future from the first film. Liam's ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen) is now separated from her husband and daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) with whom Bryan has built a solid relationship by rescuing her from slave traders, is slightly ungrateful as she would now rather spend time with her boyfriend Jamie (Luke Grimes) then let dad give her much needed driving lessons.<br/><br/>In order to make it easy on the script writers, Bryan and family travel to Istanbul.

The scenes of actions are also a little less good, may be because of the change of director but it remains plausible. Here, Bryan's daughter, Kim is no longer the person saved but she's sort of the savior, that's pretty interesting. Nevertheless, there are still some surrealistic aspects of Bryan's reflection, which have been overemphasized at times by the situation in which he is. I find it a shame not to have given any news about Kim's singing career when, as I recall, it was the final scene of the first opus. It's still a good movie and 7/10 is pretty logical.

"zkonedog","6","1","1","3 March 2017"," A Rare Feat Of Successful Repetition
","Despite being a pretty darn good overall movie in its own right, the original ""Taken"" succeeds primarily because Liam Neeson makes the leap from solid character actor to leading man. His performance is what carries the show. In this sequel, the filmmakers are able to replicate pretty much the same scenarios as that original and get away with it because of the raw emotion involved in both the stories and the characters.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Taken 2"" sees the same gang that abducted Kim (Maggie Grace) in the first movie now looking for revenge against parents Brian (Neeson) and Lenore (Famke Janssen).<br/><br/>There are two reasons why this film works so well despite using much of the same subject matter as the original:<br/><br/>1. The emotions behind the simple revenge-based plot are so visceral. Grace's persona of Kim is so innocent (but yet true-to-life) that one cannot help but root for her either to be the hero or the one being saved by the hero. Simply put, she's the on-screen daughter that everyone wants to protect.<br/><br/>2. With that first crucial plot step in place, Neeson's magnificent character is given a chance to shine. With Grace providing the dramatic moments, Neeson brings the action and intensity with a passion. Film buffs recently learned that Neeson's distinctive baritone means nothing without a great plot/drama behind it (see: ""Unknown""). When given the opportunity to hone his character, though, Neeson can provide relentless intensity with as little as a few words.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Taken 2"" is a strong sequel to the original. It pretty much contains all the ""same stuff"" as the first one, but the characters are still relatable and the action is still top-notch. If you really enjoyed ""Taken"", this will probably not be a disappointment for you."

Taken 2 appears to take its time getting to the action, dithering away an inordinate amount of time on Lenore's crumbling marriage, her astonishingly good relationship with Bryan, and Bryan's notification that Kim has a boyfriend. The film's action sequences are wide and thin and the camera is noticeably shaky in many of the scenes. The plot isn't too much, nor is it all that interesting. Predictable in the least. Overall, Taken 2 does deliver in some ways but in general, the film is quite boring and not too entertaining. Though it isn't too long, which is a plus.<br/><br/>As a rewatch 12/4/18' Taken 2 relies on a very similar atmosphere and tone set in Taken, though this film feels much less without the suspense and overall thrills seen in Taken. We can see as to why the rating for Taken 2 is much less as compared with Taken, as people had high expectations, and were ultimately somewhat letdown. Although, this film does have some very decent moments but action, it isn't on the level of the original. Rating changed from 4 to 6."
"zafar142007","5","1","1","30 July 2016"," Usual stuff, does nothing new
","This movie does not offer any surprises. The plot is linear, no turns in sight; it's as if the original film has been remade. Lots of shooting, car chases, people dropping dead; it's the usual fare. Neeson looks good, sounds good, and shoots good. He is like the unkillable hulk, just like the first movie. The other actors don't have much to do. They are either running, shooting, or fainting. Unlike the first movie, this does not have any memorable dialogues, not for me. If you just want to see an action flick, or if you haven't seen the first movie, you can go for this one, but don't expect too much. If you have seen the first one, maybe you can leave this one out."

Acting is unnecessary and also Liam Neeson is tired. Scene actions are not realistic and Istanbul don't create a real appeal like Paris. Maggie Grace is not a child anymore and Famke Janssen is had difficulty with acting. Everyone in this time made a sequel but it is not a rule!

"ahegde3149","5","1","1","3 July 2015"," A step down from first film, but not horrible
","Taken 2 is no where near the first film. Its filled with inconsistencies and silly clichéd situation which don't make any sense at all. Yet somehow, I felt it was an somewhat satisfactory experience thanks to the powerhouse Liam Neeson and some good action. The families of all the Albanian human-traffickers killed by Brian in first film are very angry and are now seeking revenge. This time they try to capture Brian along with his ex-wife Lenore and daughter Kim. But they are successful in capturing only Brian and Lenore. Kim escapes with guidance from her father over his secret cell-phone(which by the looked silly and unrealistic). Now its Kim's job to locate them and then along with her dad kill the bad guys! I liked the way Brian deduces his location with his skills and also didn't mind Kim given the role of savior. Even if on the whole the story maybe rehash of first one, its a bit dynamic in its approach. Liam Neeson is bad-ass as in the first film and action sequences are good again (except the car chases). He is enough reason to give the film some credits. It is still filled with insanely silly things such as Kim learning to drive a gear-shift car out of nowhere or when the bad guys not even torturing Brian or Lenore after kidnapping them. Great Revenge! There is not even person guarding Brian despite knowing the kind of skills he posses and thus he left alone to easily plan his escape. Cool! Taken 2 has its fill of stupidities, yet there were many things I liked. I liked the way they extended the father-daughter relationship and made Kim make up for her rather passive role in first film. The story may be predictably silly at times but I couldn't resist wanting to watch Neeson kick some ass. Taken 2 is an obvious step down from first film but considering kind of horrible sequels we are getting these days in the action genre, it is not so bad. And after watching the Taken 3 recently, Taken 2 feels like an excellent film.<br/><br/>RATING: [2.5/5]"
"rmax304823","2","1","1","14 March 2015"," Painful.
","It somehow seems perfectly apt that the director of this piece of commercial garbage should be called Oliver Megaton. If the name didn't exist it would have to be invented for pile drivers like this.<br/><br/>In ""Taken"", Liam Neeson, ex Everything, saves his young daughter after she's been kidnapped by greaseballs who want to sell her into white slavery in Paris -- or something like that. He wipes them all out.<br/><br/>Now, the problem is that the villains, all dead, can not be brought back for a sequel. What to do, what to do. Okay. I've got it. The Arab heavies must have a family, right? And, as we all know, them Arab camel drivers are all tribal and everything so we'll have the pater familias seek revenge. An eye for an eye, said Hammurabi, also a camel driver. And who's to object? Everybody has long forgotten George W. Bush's announcement that ""we are not at war with Islam."" We ARE at war with Islam! Kill 'em all and let God sort 'em out. They're not good for anything except oil and falafels.<br/><br/>We can almost hear the slight whir of well-practiced gear wheels in the Hollywood studios. For a brief period it was the South American cartels. For an equally brief interval it was the Albanians because who the hell knows where Albania is? The MBAs in Hollywood must yearn for the good old days of fat, bald Nazi sadists and fat, bald Cold War slobs, although they WILL regress from time to time. Both ""Air Force One"" and the dismal ""Crimson Tide"" pinned the Russians to the wall -- but splinter groups! The blockbuster ""Die Hard"" had a German gang but some of them spoke Russian. The executives couldn't make up their minds which was the better villain. In psychology this is known as an approach/approach conflict.<br/><br/>I've kind of skipped the plot because it's an hour-and-a-half burden of meretricious crap. You've seen it all before -- the car chases, the lightning-fast karate blows, the gun skittering along the floor, the horrible deaths of broken necks, shattered bodies, and blood-splattered walls. The climax is emblematic. Neeson is holding a pistol against the head of the last villain, the most important, the old man whose family was decimated. Neeson offers to put the gun down if the old chap will give his word that the vendetta is now at an end. The old man gives his word. Neeson put down the gun and turns to leave. The old man picks up the gun, aims it at Neeson's back, and pulls the trigger. Click. The Baba should have seen that coming. I guess they don't get out to the movies much.<br/><br/>Of course, Liam Neeson, whom I like a lot, is an unpretentious actor and has a remarkably endearing nose. He hulks his way through this paranoid fantasy with no martial arts skills but with a seasoned editor who knows how to make it look as if Neeson did have them.<br/><br/>Nice scenery -- shot in Istanbul.<br/><br/>If you enjoy being tied up and mistreated while wearing a black leather mask and having a red rubber ball strapped in your mouth -- which is okay by me, you know, a chacun à son goût -- then you'll go through an autonomic spasm while watching this. Otherwise, spend your time more constructively."

","Was it me, or was this movie extremely short? I love Liam Neeson and the character Brian, but i really want happy with this movie. First of all, I'm no professional reviewer. I like to think of myself as the ""Soccer Mom of Reviewing."" Meaning, my reviews are largely influenced by how much time I set aside to watch a movie with my spouse, without the kiddos. I found myself wondering where the rest of the movie went. It wasn't that it wasn't action packed, because it was. Just that something seemed to be missing. I think that the disconnect was because they were all together. There wasn't the task of finding out who do it, we all knew instantly. Ummmm, tattoo. But that wasn't completely it either. I literally did not believe any of the Lenore, Famke Janssen,storyline. I mean, things were great in the first movie. She was solidly, in your face Brian, with her hubby. But now, after everything that happened to Kim, they suddenly are 'having problems'? I don't know, seemed convenient to me. There was no pressure here either. Without the time constraint of the first movie...gone forever in 72 hours....it just seemed like any other movie. There were moments of greatness....the grenade mapping system, the van second countdown. But the adrenaline was missing. And, in the end, I couldn't really have cared less if Lenore was dead or alive. As for Brian being tired, well, he is aging,lol. But sure did look darn good. I'll see Taken 3,just to finish off the series. I really hope they find a way to inoculate it with some of the original Taken's thrill and story. Previews aren't giving much away. Only the uncomfortable fact that-it all didn't end there."

","Now I do love the first taken film and now with the third coming out I have decided to finally watch the second film and I must say I am disappointed as this is a distinctly average film. This film sees Bryan mills returning to deal with the families of his daughters kidnappers who have taken him and his ex wife. Now Liam neeson returns for this film and is good but he isn't really given allot to work with due to the story. The supporting cast is not the best but I think famke Janssen does a good job in the film with her character having much More relevance in this film then the first one. Maggie Grace is back as the daughter and I didn't like her in the first film and with her character more important in this film I once again do not like her. Unlike the first film there is a villain in this film, however, he is a clear idiot and allows mills to destroy his plans so easily. The story goes away from the first taken film and went from a simple premise to a convoluted plot that made no sense and took away from taken's strengths and showed its weaknesses up. The script from the first film and the second film manage to make it feel realistic but this film's dialogue is quite rigid sometimes because of the story. The style is cool sometimes with the car chases and action, but the film is unrealistic to a tee and there is also allot of shaky cam involved. Overall this film is distinctly average and I hope taken 3 is more like the original then this film."

"brchthethird","5","1","1","10 October 2014"," Coasts on Liam Neeson's charisma despite being more contrived than the first
","TAKEN 2 is a blatant rehash of its predecessor that also has a marked reduction in filmmaking quality, yet it is still watchable due to Liam Neeson's work in the lead role. Bryan Mills is back in this sequel to surprise hit TAKEN, and this time he's been able to get a little more involved with his family while also doing security work on the side. While on assignment in Istanbul, his wife and daughter show up unexpectedly, but unbeknownst to them, survivors of the Albanian family that Bryan massacred in the previous film have tracked him down in order to exact their revenge. What this film makes evident is just how contrived the plot of the first one was, and ups the ante in terms of the lack of believability. While the film starts off in similar fashion to the previous one, there is a plot element which becomes convenient later for the sake of having an action set-piece. This set-piece is a car chase through the streets of Istanbul that has Maggie Grace's character drive like a maniac all while being chased by the Albanian baddies. Other ridiculous elements include a laughable scene where Bryan has his daughter throw grenades into public places so that he can approximate her location relative to his by how long the sound takes to reach him. It's absolutely ludicrous, but still funny at the same time. However, the real negative that can be taken away is the change in shooting/editing style, courtesy of director Olivier Megaton. While Pierre Morel attempted to give TAKEN a modicum of comprehensibility, Olivier Megaton opts for shaky-cam and haphazard editing (frame-cutting, rapidly changing angles) that obscures what seemed like some decent fight choreography. Even the visual aesthetic has been changed to reflect this more down-and-dirty style which, while effective at conveying a sense of urban dirtiness and griminess, gave the film an ugly sheen which put a damper on what could have been a relatively fun adventure. Still, despite all of this and the fact that all of the supporting characters come off as perfunctory, Liam Neeson is able to sell this concept yet again. Overall, its quality doesn't live up to its predecessor's fine production values, but fans of the original should find enjoyment."

I bet they are right on that criticism, but in my case I was (and still am) ignorant on how the real Turkey is. so that don't bother me. When you don't expect something, you don't get bother for inconsistency with reality. For example, an airline pilot would hate a unrealistic plane movie, when a regular person would not mind.<br/><br/>Back to Taken 2, the action was very good. Is true that in some situations was like ""too good to be true"". Things like guards not looking to prisoners, so they have a chance to escape. This happens in so many movies. Sometimes we forgive this, some other times we don't. Didn't bother me that much, but might be an issue for you if you expect Taken 2 be as realistic as Taken 1.<br/><br/>Maybe a reason I like it is because I didn't watch Taken 1 before I watch Taken 2. I mean, I watch Taken 2 first, and later I watch Taken 1. For that reason I watch Taken 2 without comparing to the previous movie. Work for me.<br/><br/>If you don't mind the Hollywood surrealism, and the fact that is not as good as the 1st movie, is enjoyable.<br/><br/>Actors great; action great; story great; visual effects great. Realism not so great; a few clichés are there about bad guys vs good guys.<br/><br/>If you plan to watch it, please don't try to compare it to the 1st movie. Also, you might want to leave real world political and cultural situation out of the window. Maybe a little of common sense too.<br/><br/>Worst movie?

It was OK as a piece of entertainment but I felt it didn't do anything the first film didn't. You usually expect a sequel to expand on the story of the first but this one virtually told the same story but with a couple of alterations. It seemed like the studio (Fox) were just out to cash in on the success of the first one.

","As others (many others) have noted, ""Taken 2"" doesn't even come close to being as good as ""Taken."" And, as others (many others) have noted, the movie is weakened badly by the unbelievability of much of what happens. There were several, but really three things stuck with me most. At the beginning of the movie, during the funeral scene, why are Albanians speaking Arabic? I get that they're Muslims (of course) and I understand that the Koran isn't considered the true Koran unless it's read in Arabic, but why would Albanians speak Arabic as a matter of routine? They'd speak Albanian in every day life. Then I wondered, why is there a U.S. Embassy in Istanbul? Istanbul isn't the capital of Turkey - Ankara is. The U.S. Embassy in Turkey would be in Ankara. There'd probably be a U.S. consulate in Istanbul, but the building (when we see it) is clearly marked as the Embassy. Finally, Kim (Maggie Grace)- who was the object of her dad's search in ""Taken"" and who couldn't pass a driving test back home in California - sure did a pretty good job driving through the crowded streets of Istanbul! There are other things that didn't make a lot of sense, but those were the things that really stood out to me.<br/><br/>Now, having said that, if you can suspend your disbelief this is a pretty decent action movie. There are some great chase scenes (including the one in which Kim is inexplicably pulling off some pretty fancy moves), and some pretty good fight scenes. Liam Neeson, who reprised the role of Bryan, seems (somehow) to take the whole thing quite seriously. I thought the movie was rather slow starting but once the action started it had a certain fun quality to it. Its main problem is that it's just not as good as the original. (5/10)"

However he gained super sonic speed at one point to rescue his daughter. A lot of the scenes are very convenient and and they seem to find their way around Istanbul very easily.

In this one ,Liam seemed like he was being far too heavy handed with the bad guys.<br/><br/>I also agree the bad guys looked and acted pretty stupid.It is almost a cliché in Hollywood movies to have bad guys swept aside easily.There was one credible fight scene towards the end where Liam was somewhat tested.There was nothing peculiarly thrilling about the ending.<br/><br/>I do feel the character development was lacking, Murads character needed to be stronger and his vengeance needed to seem more believable.

I was originally excited at the beginning of the movie, as it had a great set up. But somewhere along the line it went sour. You can tell that there is really only one way to right a movie about a CIA agent who goes after his family as the feeling of the first movie quickly overpowers this movie. This wouldn't be a bad thing (as I said I was a huge fan of the first one). But I quickly found myself looking to see how much was left in the movie time as I got bored. The past action of the first movie was not met, the crew could have invested in some lighting equipment, it looked like some scenes were filmed by a 5 year old holding a camera, and frankly there were times where I was just left going ""what just happened."" With all that being said, Liam Neeson had a solid role in my opinion, but it was not enough for me to flop anymore than a generous 5 on this movie. If you are a Taken fan or a Liam Neeson fan I would recommend seeing this if you can come by it cheap, or it crosses your path.

","This film is about a retired CIA agent who gets targeted by the same crooks he encountered a few years earlier.<br/><br/>""Taken 2"" keeps the thrill, tension and suspense of ""Taken"". The plot flows naturally, even with references to the first film thrown in. Action starts early in the film, and keeps on going with lots of adrenaline action. I particularly like the hunt for Mills by the daughter, it is clever and the subplot even appears logical! The only thing I found illogical was that the wife woke up so quickly with a full range of emotions, after being apparently being comatose, sleeping through the sounds of hundreds of gunshots. ""Taken 2"" is a action thriller that kept me on edge throughout, and I enjoyed watching it."

","Can't believe how laughably bad this movie is.

The bad guys are evil far easterners with minds set on vengeance. This movie is almost arty in the way it depicts prejudice on more levels than one. A meta film about the European way of regarding American religious fundamentalism with extreme prejudice... Suppose I'm pissing off some American readers here, but really, this movie would be regarded as a Taliban top ten had it been a guy in nightgown and turban killing off the bad guys."

","There are a diverse collection of errors in this film that are from various fields of knowledge. Turkey-Albania border pass belongs to the geography field. A teenager lacking the skills to pass a driving test in USA with an automatic car becoming a total drifter in a foreign metropol with a manual transmission car best fits to the logic errors section. There are many more but the main problem was the moment that the audience is assumed to have forgotten the main theme.<br/><br/>The biggest flaw for me was a single scene, which destroyed the whole motto in the film and turned it into a themeless action scene bundle. At the beginning, the Albanian mafia men were presented as deliriously loyal to their fallen friends such that they chase an ex-CIA agent, who has just managed to destroy their entire crime organization in a few days, in a foreign country. However, when Neeson and a mafia man came into a position that they point guns to each other, things changed abruptly. Neeson threatened the men by killing his friend, but the Albanian, without any hesitation, responded by brutally killing his own teammate by his own gun. Interesting choice for a film, whose main theme was woven with the desire to take loved ones' revenge."
"roberts-journalist","3","1","1","23 January 2013"," Lazy film-making
","The laziness in this movie was just incredible. Here's a sequel that relies mostly of ridiculous clichés and several flashbacks from the first feature to get the job done. That someone might even consider giving this a good rating saddens me deeply, because this is just a bad, bad movie.<br/><br/>I must say I wasn't a big admirer of the first Taken either. I though it was a standard, but fairly decent action flick, with a fierce and believable hero in the person of ex-CIA agent Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson). But Taken 2 represents everything that is wrong with today's movies, as it pretty much sums up to nothing more a shallow sequel, clumsily built on the foundation of a better predecessor.<br/><br/>The story in Taken 2 is the standard follow-up after the original Taken. Remember the Albanians killed in Paris by Mills? Well, their relatives from Tropojë want revenge, so they plan to capture Bryan, along with his wife and daughter, while the three are on vacation in Istanbul, Turkey. I should also say that, since the first Taken, things have changed a bit. Lenore (Famke Janssen) had broken up with her rich husband and Kim (Maggie Grace) is still trying to get her driving license. She now has a boyfriend, of whom, obviously, the super-daddy doesn't approve. Cheesy. Predictable. Stupid. Lame.<br/><br/>Visually, the movie relies heavily on flashbacks from Taken and several panoramic shots with the wonderful city of Istanbul. The action sequences are pretty well done and the bad guys die rather quickly. There are also some (unintentionaly) funny moments. My favorite is when, in a moment of generosity, the kidnappers wait for Neeson, at gunpoint, to call his beloved daughter and let her know that she's about to get abducted again - in a phone conversation similar to the one from the first Taken. <br/><br/>After the no-named thugs led by Murade (Rade Serbedzija) have been completely annihilated by Mills & Kim (on race-driver mode), the films ends, as expected, on a familiar note. With everyone happy, but the viewer."
"paul_haakonsen","5","1","1","23 January 2013"," First it was the daughter, now it is the entire family...
","Well I must say that I have somewhat mixed feelings about ""Taken 2"". On one hand, then it is an enjoyable and entertaining movie, but on the other hand, then then movie was somewhat unnecessary and sort of on the point of being too much. How is that? Well, in the first movie they took his daughter, and now they take his entire family, what's next? They take their pets too?<br/><br/>Story-wise, then ""Taken 2"" is sort of boiling soup off the broth that was made to make the first ""Taken"" movie. It is entertaining, but the story is just too feeble and shallow, and it just doesn't come off as all that believable.<br/><br/>The story is that while on an assignment in Istanbul, Bryan Mills's family get taken, and it becomes a joint-family effort to escape the clutches of the aggressor, who turns out to be the father of one of the bad guys from the first ""Taken"" movie.<br/><br/>Sure, the plot here is not the best of plots, but the action scenes and sequences in the movie were nice, and there is a good amount of suspense to the movie as well, which in overall actually does make the movie rather enjoyable. But if you are watching this for the story, you might find yourself cheated.<br/><br/>As for the actors and actresses in the movie, well they all did good jobs with their roles, especially Liam Neeson, which wouldn't come as a surprise to anyone. His role as Bryan Mills is quite good, and he does play the role quite nicely. It is a great character with many layers to it, both as a security expert and a family man.<br/><br/>""Taken 2"" is good entertainment, but it goes lightly on the story."
"xadarshx","5","1","1","22 January 2013"," Solid Action with Gaping Plot holes
","The spoilers are very minor, and only available to explain what went wrong.<br/><br/>The original Taken was a fantastic movie with great action and dialog. Unfortunately taken 2 fails to fill the shoes of its great predecessor. <br/><br/>The main story follows the events after the first movie, as the father of the kidnapper who died while Bryan Mills was saving his daughter, now wants revenge. <br/><br/>An excellent premise for a movie, yet as the story unfolds you are left holding a lot of loose knots. Heavily focused story elements are left unfinished. An essentially it feels as if parts of the script just went messing and no one noticed. The only redeeming quality is probably the action, as even the acting for the other characters are sub par.<br/><br/>Lets start from the beginning. As you know Bryan Mills lives the life of a retired agent, trying to make his living body guarding and doing what ever job comes his way. His marriage is broken and his kid essentially ignores him. Yet you would think after the fact her father went across the world and found her in the middle of no where and saved her from a sex ring she would be a bit more appreciative. Yet her attitude essentially remains the same as the first movie. All of a sudden out of no where the wife's second marriage is failing for no reason, the daughter has a boyfriend. None of these elements are further explored and simply mentioned hoping to add ambiance to the story. Yet they focus so heavily on it, just to drop it and never mention it again, is just a bit of lazy writing.<br/><br/>Finally when the main plot starts, things start making sense for a few minutes. Then all hell breaks loose as the daughter ends up becoming a professional drifter and driver in a period of 10 seconds. Yet failed her driving test 2 years in a row. Not to mention a professional sprinter with the ability to run across roofs and leaping tall bounds. At this point i was expecting her to rip off her shirt and see an S on white spandex, maybe even Lex Luther as the final mastermind. Luckily the lawyers probably advised against licensing superman into the story. But the oddities don't end there. Near the end of the story this massive element which results in them entering the embassy is shown. After that, they just drop it like a hot potato and play it as if nothing happened. Its almost as if the director lost parts of the script, and just shot the movie with what ever pages were remaining. <br/><br/>Is this movie worth watching? yes The biggest issue is, don't think when watching this movie. See the beautiful scenic images of Constantinople. Watch the shiny VFX and be happy. If you try to make sense of the story you probably will end up hating it. An unfortunately yes - there seems to be a plot line remaining to make a Taken 3."
"Blooner","4","1","1","21 January 2013"," Uninspired and unfortunate continuation
","Review originally posted on InspirationRation.com - When Taken released in 2008 it was a surprise hit. It had all the right elements for a great action flick; an excellent plot with strong motivations for the main protagonist, great action moments, and that iconic scene where Liam Neeson's character, Bryan Mills, threatens his daughter's kidnapper over the phone. Liam Neeson became an instant action hero because of it, and rightfully so.<br/><br/>Now we are back for more in Taken 2, but unfortunately something is different. Much of what made the original great is missing from this sequel. This time around the plot is truly inferior. Let's lay out some of the reasons why.<br/><br/>The plot for Taken revolved around the kidnap of young women for prostitution, a truly horrendous, but ultimately impersonal act. Which made it so great that Bryan Mills was there to put a stop to it. The bad guys simply picked 'the wrong man's' daughter to mess with. This time around the plot just revolves around revenge. It is very personal, and very simple. There is no logic at all to the motivations of the main antagonist. His son was murdered by Bryan Mills, but then again, his son had kidnapped and sold Bryan's daughter into prostitution. I'd say they are pretty even.<br/><br/>Secondly, and most importantly, in the original movie there was a very strong sense of urgency. There was a short time-frame in which Bryan would be able to get his daughter back. This created a high-stress situation where there was no time for discussions or second guessing. Additionally, it created a realistic reason not to involve other parties, as this would take way too much time. However, in Taken 2, this sense of urgency is greatly reduced. Bryan even seems to leisurely take his time when having been kidnapped himself. Even the whole movie takes its time, with the prologue before the action even begins lasting a significant portion of the movie's runtime.<br/><br/>These weak character motivations and lack of urgency in the plot create arduous discussions and conversations, the awkwardness of which just highlights how superficial the plot truly is. However, as this is an action movie the plot is not really the most important part; the action is.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the action also leaves something to be desired. The fighting- and shooting-scenes are short and far in-between, and ultimately pretty forgettable. There is a nice car-chase, but this is rather ruined by Liam Neeson yelling the same line, ""Go faster!"", over and over and over and over again.<br/><br/>So is there any reason to go see this movie? Well, the acting here is pretty great. Liam Neeson is his quality self, and Maggie Grace and Famke Janssen prove their worth again as well. The great scenery is also worth noting, with beautiful Istanbul set as the location for the majority of the movie.<br/><br/>Taken 2 shows as much creativity as its title, so sit down to watch this movie with the mind-set that it is not going to be a continuation of the greatness of the first Taken. Make sure not to think too critically (or preferably at all), and you should be reasonably entertained. - Review originally posted on InspirationRation.com"
"wild_wister","7","1","1","20 January 2013"," The problem with Taken 2 **MINOR SPOILERS**
","The main difference between Taken and Taken 2 is the vibe of film. Taken was an action,mystery,thriller. Taken 2 is more of the stereotypical ""Man movie."" Minor spoilers start here.<br/><br/>Taken 2 is more action orientated, with more shooting and hand-to-hand combat than any other element. In Taken, Liam Neeson was constantly looking for leads and almost losing the trail once or twice, but in Taken 2 he is in one city where all he has to do is listen to the sounds around him so he can track down his enemy. Another problem is the close quarters combat scenes. Punches and hits flash so fast it's like you've gone back to the 90s and turned on an episode of Power Rangers (there is an uncut version I haven't seen, so things might be clearer in that.) Taken 2 is best seen only if you've seen Taken to know why Liam Neeson is being targeted by the villains and if you want to see the next chapter in Brian Mills' life, not if you're just looking for a Friday night action flick."

I felt like I wasted my time. Only one thing in this movie was good and that was performance of Liam Neeson. I liked other performances also, but it wasn't enough to save the movie. Director couldn't help himself to spoil the memory of original movie by nonsense ideas. The ideas are so wrong but somehow they seem to work, I am not saying this but perhaps director Olivier was thinking this while he was creating this movie with full of nonsense ideas.<br/><br/>One of my friends was saying that ""you are thinking of Taken that's why you didn't like taken 2. If you see taken 2 first then there is a chance that you will like it."" But I say there is nothing you can do to like this movie.

She also manages to navigate her way across roofs, evading her pursuers and finding just the right chimney to deliver her missile down just on time.

Keeping true to his word Bryan, his daughter and ex-wife decide to take a family vacation.

"NewYorkLondonParisMunich","2","1","1","24 December 2012"," nearly worthless
","This film is a disappointment in so many ways, ranging from stupid and predictable dialogue to incomprehensible fast-cut action where you can't tell what's going on. But here's one huge problem. It's set in Istanbul, an attractive and modern city, where there's a strong police presence that keeps the city's many visitors safe. Many people have visited Istanbul, either as a destination or as a layover on low-cost Turkish Airlines. A major part of the film's audience knows that the city is NOT like it's portrayed here. Women do not wear burqas in Istanbul. The police do not drive tiny flimsy 1970s-era sedans. Boulevards are wide and well-marked. You can't fire guns and toss grenades around without a LOT of police attention, very fast. <br/><br/>Why bother setting the film in Istanbul, then acting like it's some uncivilized lawless Third World slum? A large part of the film's audience knows Istanbul is nothing like this.<br/><br/>More significant problems:<br/><br/>* The US Embassy is in the nation's capital, Ankara. There is a US Consulate in Istanbul. <br/><br/>* US embassies and consulates do not have American soldiers guarding the buildings from behind sandbags, ready to gun down anyone who approaches. That would be awfully inconvenient for American tourists who need additional passport pages and for local citizens applying for visas.<br/><br/>* If you could simply crash through a flimsy guard booth and have your vehicle in the middle of the US compound, that wouldn't be much protection against car bombs, would it?<br/><br/>* Albania and Turkey do not have a common border. Neither country has frontier checkpoints with primitive hand-raised gates on a single dirt track. <br/><br/>* Travelers cannot simply check their guns and grenades into their luggage, then pick them up in Turkey. Travelers cannot detonate grenades in crowded areas in Turkey, then simply board the flight home. Travelers cannot fire guns, destroy police cars, and commit multiple homicides, then easily pass through passport control.<br/><br/>It's an utterly moronic movie. I love suspension-of-disbelief action flicks as much as anyone else (I love the Bourne and Mission Impossible franchises), but ""Taken 2"" is a complete waste of time."

It was too short, no suspense and making it a 12a rating didn't help as it took away the violence ( which made the first film even better )<br/><br/>If you looking for a normal action film then it was okay.

"aaditya-swaroop","7","1","1","28 October 2012"," Shades of Original 'Taken' but no match for it
","Taken 2 had a huge burden to carry - that of Taken 1. The success of taken was based on multiple factors - the portrayed perfection of Bryan mills by Liam Neeson(the perfect ""preventor""), screenplay depth, action sequences, hard-hitting dialogues (""I will find you""), fast paced nature of the film and overall, the believability factor - the film looked & felt real. Liam Neeson, as always, was brilliant and brought seriousness to Bryan Mills character. As the story is with most sequels, Taken 2 did not deliver the same adrenaline as Taken 1. But on a standalone basis, its a good action movie - fast paced, slick, good action sequences and nice screenplay resulting in character depth.<br/><br/>For me, the highlight of the Taken 2 was the screenplay and detailing of action sequences. Taken 2 had the same screenplay team who wrote Taken 1- Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen. These two guys have a thing for action movies and they have delivered high adrenaline heart-pumping flicks like transporter series, revolver, colombiana, Leon the professional - all movies with slick action. The highlight of Luc & Robert's work is that they don't depend on lot of explosions and high intensity fire power to create an action packed movie. They accessorize the central character with skills like extremely sharp presence of mind, hand-to-hand-combat expertise, knowledge of all kinds of weaponry etc. Basically, the protagonist is an exceptionally trained character (with army background or an ex-spy) applying his skills in real world crime scenarios. It puts the viewers in an awe of the protagonist from the first time they see him in action & from there the character build-up continues - exceptional story/screenplay skills. Luc & Robert are also very creative when it comes to action sequences. The stunt team doesn't pack the action sequences with punches, kicks or simply martial arts. It involves using a lot of small items from the place where the action is happening - be it Jason Statham's spilling of oil & then using cycle pedals to skid over it or Bryan mills presence of mind while using wooden sticks or counting the strokes of the watch when he is first kidnapped and understanding the course of the van from his knowledge of the city. Robert & Luc are adept at building the character before such genius presence of mind is displayed - everything about the characters just fits in and is precise and exceptionally executed. Taken 2 had the same qualities and that always kept the viewer on the edge of the seat with a WOW look on the face. One low point of the screenplay, when compared with Taken 1, was including some avoidable side stories - Kim's boyfriend, driving license, the separation etc. Taken 1's screenplay was honest - it was only about Mills and his passion for saving his daughter. The honesty in Taken 2 got diluted. <br/><br/>Liam Neeson portrayed Bryan Mills to perfection, again. He a mature actor and brings a sense of perfection to all his roles. I love the guy.<br/><br/>There are some obvious lows in the movie which made the movie less believable, which as I mentioned, was the strong point of Taken 1. Like Kim throwing grenades around in a crowded city, Kim driving the cab with expertise when she couldn't even get a license back home, the Albanians leaving Mills for long stretches of time post his capture (they were thirsty for his blood but suddenly wanted to wait when they capture him), bad guys emptying whole cartridges of bullets on Mills and hitting nothing. Taken 2 also picked up some specific style of dialogues & scenes which reminded the viewer of part 1 - obvious lack of creativity or simple laziness. Olivier Megaton's direction was also a low point - Colombiana was a much better effort than this. <br/><br/>All in all, Taken 2 did not bore me but it did disappoint me. Being a die-hard ""Taken"" fan, I'll let this one go by with a smirk. Much more creativity is needed to surpass the original. Would love to see Bryan Mills in action again. I hear Taken 3 has been announced. Rating for taken 2 - 6.5 out of 10."

THAT IS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO Cliché!!!! that idea has been used in SO MANY SEQUELS! but the main problem with this movie is the clichés it has to offer. like a driving scene that goes on for like 15 minutes and crap. but the other thing is that the parents get taken. and the daughter has to save them. what is she gonna use for a weapon??? a ipod touch 5th generation?? sorry bad joke. but there is this boring part where liam neeson tells the daughter what to do while the parents are being tortured. its this thing where his daughter has to draw circles on a map. what the heck???? then he told her to get one of Liam's shoelaces... so i wont tell anymore but don't see this movie it taken our money hahahahah no???"

This time he kidnaps Bryan and his wife in Istanbul. Bryan must communicate to his daughter to seek help and save his wife before the kidnappers finds his daughter and murder his family.<br/><br/>Directed by Olivier Megaton(Transporter 3, Columbiana) , Taken 2 is a one-time watch with nothing new to offer. The plot is wafer-thin and has weak storyline. It had potential to be made into a big-film but weak screenplay and poor direction made it terrible. Despite these shortcomings , I felt Taken 2 is not that bad thanks to superb show by Liam Nesson. The legendary actor is the soul of the film with his husky voice and tremendous personality. He gives in all with his widely- appealing hand-hand combat and solid-punching dialogues. Similar goes for efficient action scenes, though original part had better action stunts. Camera work is good along with good back ground score. <br/><br/>I felt Taken 2 took advantage of immense popularity gained by first part but it was no where close to it. If you are big fan of Liam Nesson then it is certainly for you otherwise you might give it a miss. Average 2.5 / 5"
"richy1024","6","1","1","14 October 2012"," Taken 2 far or just a case of sequel syndrome?
","Following the recapture of his estranged daughter from Albanian mutineers in Paris, Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) recalls his lively encounter on the hunt for the radical captors in the French capital, but this time in Istanbul. Mills invites his former wife, Lenore (Famke Janssen) and daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) in an attempt to gather some family bonding following Lenore's divide from her affluent partner. Mills subsequently becomes the target due to his escapades from emancipating Kim from the productive sex merchants in Paris. Categorically, as the adversaries seek revenge for the death of their sons and brothers, they track the trio, detaining Bryan himself and the rather volatile Lenore. This outing sees Kim's ripeness and maturity flourish, listening to the former C.I.A. practitioner by locating her father, but at the expense of her mother welfare. As Lenore is taken captive, Bryan conducts the ultimate rescue, as seen in part one to bring his family to safety.<br/><br/>Although the arrival of Taken's second instalment has been accompanied with plenty of publicity and prospect, audience's before now are fully aware of Bryan's past and his capacity to subjugate the opposition and fittingly becoming the saviour off those who mean dearly to him with narrow assistance from influences above. Therefore, Taken 2 is plainly repetitive, opting to continue in comparable fashion to outings in 2008. We are invited to tireless hand combat skirmishing and multiple handgun confrontations. Mills is a polished armament and the sound effects are utterly deafening, wish ravishing and piercing gunshots. The combat seems pragmatic, with intense unpredictability in movement and the usage of each environment. Mercifully, Taken 2 continues with the trend of original cinematography with a nucleus of suspense and continuation. Regrettably, Neeson's character lacks components of interrogation and carefully intriguing us with his masterful tools as seen in part one. Maggie Grace seems to have snooped counselling from her peers, although her galloping in front of the camera continues, Grace performs with more direction, portraying authority and ownership by making decisions that indubitably construct the beginning of the family's fortuitous flee from separation at the hands of their opponents. Although, one would be propose not to supply her with several hand grenades due to her lack of site awareness, but neither do the community of the Turkish capital as they seem excessively unaware of the impact of the detonations around them.<br/><br/>The essence of security and shelter is Taken's most profitable message. As the plot fails to add further direction to the first outing, the film's memorandum provides hope by considerately inserting the importance of family values and the wave of emotion a family in jeopardy suffers throughout countless episodes in its lifetime. While the climax of this outing undergoes a great deal due to its precipitate and sudden finish, it places a new equilibrium for further relatives to stomp and fail at the feet of Neeson's most hard-hitting disposition. The quintessence of family values overshadows Besson's and Megaton's lack of profundity. If you are looking for a parallel story, Besson is quite simply man you require. With poor outings previously this calendar year, one would hope that the anticipated third chapter grants us with more conviction, with a master class of changeability rather than opting for another destination for the Albanian's to capture this tired and capricious family. Although Neeson supplies us with blissful talent and warrants masses of acclaim, leaping around metropolis locations can only continue for a limited time."

","First of all, I did give this an average rating for the acting and action. It did not put us to sleep. That said, this film was very ordinary with no twists or anything shocking . It had that feel of a romantic comedy where everything that you expect happens. The film just veered along smoothly and that was the problem. In other Liam Neeson movies, ""Taken"" and 'The Other Man"" come to mind; There were twists galore , which made for an exciting movie going experience. It was clear this was along the lines of the Rocky series and other brand movie series , this was made simply for a big ,guaranteed paycheck. Not much thought went into this film. It was most likely rushed to get it into the theaters for that big payday. Shame on Liam Neeson, for this project. Hopefully, he stays away from Hollywood greed like this and becomes relevant again in his next film."

","Let's begin by just saying the director's name is, well, Olivier Megaton. Okay, let's move on. It all begins with Kim failing her driver's training exam, not once, but twice, and it all ends with her passing. This is not a spoiler. The spoiler is everything that happens between these exams. What happens: Kim has a very bad time in Istanbul. About Kim - Kim moons over her daddy, Kim moons over her boyfriend, Kim moons over her mommy; this is the most violent mooning film ever. You see, when Kim, her mommy, and her daddy aren't mooning, a lot of Muslims endure a lot of pain. Evidently anyone that interrupts this very dangerous American family while mooning is in for it. Personally, I'd let them be, and if you ever run into them in a foreign country, stay clear. Hand grenades, knives, bulletproof vests, lots of handguns - you'd think you were in Texas. This sequel is the closest any sequel has ever been to the original, in fact, it may be the same movie just set in a different city. I don't think they should do Mexico City next since that's where they did ""Man on Fire"", which is really the first movie in this series, ""Taken"" the original being ""Man on Fire"" 2. Back to Kim. She appears happy at the end, somewhere around Malibu, mooning over mommy, daddy, and her boyfriend over very large ice cream sundaes. But I don't buy it.

","Well, if you liked the original Taken, and if it is suspense and action you crave, look no further than this sequel. You should wind up very pleased.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson plays the same role in a similar scenario. Instead of going to France to rescue his daughter ""Bryan Mills"" now is in Turkey on business and winds up attempting to rescue his ex-wife and keep his daughter safe at the same time. They joined him for a little R&R after things got tense at home. They were in for a surprise. The Romanian family of all the people ""Mills"" killed in the first film are out for revenge.They have waited six years and when they hear that Mills is in nearby Istanbul, they go after he and his family.<br/><br/>The length of this movie just about right, An hour-and-a-half - with the last hour almost non-stop action, is fine. Any more than that would have been too much. It would have been overkill, you could say. Actually, it's overkill already. This is escapist fare with little credibility (Neeson kills an unknown slew of foes while none shoots him, his daughter changes quickly from someone who can't pass her driving exam to a professional stunt car driver in unfamiliar and crowded streets, etc.). <br/><br/>Nonetheless, it's fun to watch and the 90 minutes go by fast."
"TypedbyTara","7","3","6","9 October 2012"," Another Day at the Office for Neeson
","Taken 2 begins in the aftermath of the first Taken. Neeson has returned home with his rescued daughter and they both are trying to adjust to normal life. However, back in Albanian, Neeson has ruffled quite a few feathers. Apparently, you can't slay a bunch of people and expect to get away Scott-free. You see, ladies and gentleman, Taken 2 teaches us that Albanian sex-traffickers are people too, and their families do in fact, get angry when you end their lives.<br/><br/>So with vengeance in their hearts, the fathers/bosses of the slain concoct a plan to kidnap Neeson AND his family (i.e his daughter Kim and ex-wife Lenore)....mistake number one. Let's take a second and look at Neeson's track record (his previous movies): Neeson trained Batman (The Dark Knight Rises) Obi Wan and Darth Vader (Star Wars). He was Zeus (Clash of the Titans) and Aslan (Narnia) which makes him a god in two different religions. His hobbies include punching wolves (The Grey) and being a bad-ass Colonel (A-team). Not to mention that he just killed all of their youthful sons. So maybe, just maybe, these guys should have just sat down and reevaluated their plans for handling the situation. But of course they didn't.<br/><br/>With their judgment clouded by anger, the Albanians set their plan in motion and they actually manage to kidnap Neeson and Lenore, however they fail to capture Neeson's daughter, Kim (thank god because I think she went through enough the first time). The Albanians second mistake came when they forgot to search Neeson...Neeson concealed a small mini phone in his sock. Once he got free, Neeson used the device to direct Kim to his location and give him a gun. It was basically game over from there on out.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie consisted of all too familiar fight scenes where Neeson made the Albanians look like a bunch of 5th graders fresh out of their first karate class.<br/><br/>Despite this movie having a lot of similarities to the first, I thought there were some key differences. The biggest one was the tone of the movie. In the first movie, Neeson was spurred on by a burning passion to rescue his helpless and beloved daughter, he seemed to have more fire burning in his heart then. In the second movie, the kidnapping just seemed like an inconvenience. The ""bad guys"" presented no challenges for Neeson (for gods sake they didn't even listen to their own guard dog, which was their third and final strike) and it looked as though it was just another day at the office for him. In the movie Bryan (Neeson) even explained how he was tired of it all and that all he wanted to do was go home. The second difference was that the portrayal of Kim as the innocent daughter didn't cut it anymore. Maybe it was the fact that she was tossing grenades left and right. Or perhaps it was the fact that even though she failed her drivers test twice she still managed to out maneuver the local Albanians on foreign streets, and despite being shot at, got to the embassy in one piece. <br/><br/>Over all, nothing unexpected happened in this movie, it was just a solid follow-up to the first film. The acting was great, the plot was simple and there was even some parental humor tossed in (between Neeson and Kim's new boyfriend). Bottom line is that it's a good flick to watch whenever you find yourself with some free time."
"wayofthejeep","7","3","6","6 October 2012"," On par for part II's
","Lets get the obvious criticism out of the way... ""its not as good as the first one"".<br/><br/>That being said, its a fun movie. The good guys are likable and you can get behind them. It lacked the 'Death Wish' grit and determination of the first movie though, and came across as a routine action film with car chases and shootouts. Like many sequels the plot reflects that it was written just for the sake of making a sequel to a popular movie. The premise is a little too convenient- Mills brings his family for a vacation right into the back yard of the guys looking for revenge on him. (thats not a spoiler, you can deduced that from the commercials). But you can still have fun watching this movie, especially if you liked the first one.<br/><br/>Overall I'd recommend checking this out on DVD or Netflix. Its decent, but not quite worth spending $40 for tix and popcorn for two."
"Likes_Ninjas90","1","10","31","2 October 2012"," An over-produced bit of tosh, somehow more mindless and insignificant than its predecessor
","After the events of the first Taken movie, Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) is performing a security mission in Istanbul. He is surprised to be met by his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) and his ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen) at the hotel, who has recently separated from her own partner. They've come to visit him, although he is still extremely cautious and protective of his family. Bryan is also unaware that the bad guys from the first movie are seeking revenge for the death of their brothers and sons at his very hands. He had to free his daughter from a human trafficking organisation by killing these men. Now they are prepared to ambush him in Istanbul by interrogating someone that knows him. While Bryan and Lenore leave Kim at the hotel, they are stalked by the evil Albanians and eventually captured. Bryan must communicate with his daughter over the phone to try and determine his own location, escape and then finish the baddies once and for all. <br/><br/>If Taken 2 is not one of the worst films of the year because of its primitiveness and xenophobia, then it is because it is an over-produced bit of tosh, somehow more mindless and insignificant than its predecessor. There is nothing at stake in this film, no afterthought and no one to care about. It is so numbingly ingrained in a formula and signposted at every angle that at the end of its meager ninety minutes, it feels like nothing more than incidental. The film's production notes are hilarious. They praise the original as ""one the most successful and relatable action thrillers of recent years"" and that audiences identified with Bryan's desire to protect his family. It's easy to forget how many parents are secretly ex-CIA, paranoid killing machines. Neither of the Taken films are particularly concerned about family or paternity. That wouldn't be manly enough for this series. It is simply a continuation of Hollywood's unimaginative and archaic revival of the types of action films that were made in the 1980s under the Age of Reagan. <br/><br/>Violent actions films of that bygone era were bred from the political view that one person, separate from government or law enforcement, could save the world. The likes of Stallone, Schwarzenegger and Eastwood were king. But part of why Eastwood and Schwarzenegger have survived this long, post-Reaganism, is through self-reflection. Schwarzenegger's acting was never his strong suit, but comic timing was, eventually learning to parody himself. The genre became so laughably over the top that the violence was, to many people, funny. And as Eastwood's politics have moved from right-wing to less conservative views, his films have appropriated this change. His anti-Western Unforgiven (1992) saw him hang up his six-shooter, reflecting on how violence shapes a person, while Gran Tornio (2008) showed that manhood is bred from sacrifice, hard work and self-respect, not body counts. However, despite the magnitude of various political changes and events, Hollywood in its ongoing creative rut is still intent on reviving the action genre, recycling and repackaging story lines and old stars, often without humour or blood. The Taken series, highly derivative of Schwarzenegger's Commando (1985), epitomises this lethargy and strive towards decadence by offering nothing but senseless killing, if only to appease video game fans, with countless goons being barrelled over like bowling pins, bookended by cringing American hokum. <br/><br/>It matters not that Olivier Megaton has replaced French director Pierre Morel for this sequel. The template of the first film is lazily copied, retaining its uncomfortable fascist undertones. But if Liam Neeson's Bryan was originally played with conviction, the character now seems possessive and frankly, creepy. Never mind that Kim travelled overseas and survived the wrath of human traffickers (she barely shows any aftershocks from the events of the first film). Bryan discovers an even bigger revelation about his daughter: she has a boyfriend! This leads to some pointless and downright awkward scenes where he reveals that he placed a GPS tracking device in her phone to locate her at her new bloke's house. This is followed by Lenore's insistence that he doesn't run a background check on the poor guy. I didn't know whether to laugh or be horrified. The film doesn't improve once the baddies arrive and the gunfights begin in Istanbul. The film might sidestep condemning Islam and Muslims specifically, but that doesn't stop its grating xenophobic attitude of making all the baddies fat, balding, scruffy, barbarians, whose sole purpose is to torment those poor Americans. Damn foreigners! <br/><br/>This untimely attitude, uncomfortable considering recent film-related violence against the West, is compounded by a lack of context. The first film saw Bryan's daughter as a smaller component of a larger scheme. Now the narrative and the locations are repetitive and contained. It drastically limits the scope of the story and the action. Everything that happens is either absurdly predetermined or a blur. How lucky is Bryan that his captors only take him so far that he can still determine his location from the sound of a grenade? It's a good thing he packed those maps and hidden microphone so his daughter can determine where he is. Also, beware any bearded men hiding behind newspapers. If you're watching the film expecting a bloodbath you'll be disappointed too. All of the action scenes are distractingly over-edited, amateurishly photographed and near bloodless. But no matter, at the end of the day the most the Mills family has to worry about is driving lessons and the number of milkshakes they've ordered at the local diner."

","THE Islamophobia is toned down in French director Olivier Megaton's senior-citizen action thriller Taken 2. Liam Neeson still gets to whip the behinds of Albanian Muslim villains, but his character also gets to show off his gentle side, including teaching his teen daughter how to drive.<br/><br/>In fact, retired CIA agent Bryan Mills spends quite a bit of of time comforting his ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen) deal with problems arising from her second marriage. Lenore still wants to get it on with him. Bryan, however, is more interested in their daughter Kim's (Maggie Grace) boyfriend and teaching her how to pass her driving exam.<br/><br/>In the meantime, the Albanians, whose kids or relatives were killed by Bryan in the first movie written by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen four years ago, vow to avenge their deaths.<br/><br/>The writing duo don't let the Albanians down. They concoct a plan to let the Albanians, led by Murad (Rade Serbedzija), capture Bryan, his ex- wife and daughter in Istanbul.<br/><br/>Bryan had invited them there after the ex-wife's second husband had suddenly cancelled travel plans. What the second husband would think of his family's sudden excursion to Istanbul is not revealed.<br/><br/>The villains do get to kidnap Bryan and Lenore, but not before they let Kim, who's wearing a red bikini top, escape from their clutches in a hotel. In fact, the bumbling villains had already let their presence be spotted by our dear hero in the hotel and, later, in a busy market.<br/><br/>The villains put a hood over Bryan but he can counts stops and streets. He also listens to the environment (dogs barking and man playing a violin) while they take him and Lenore to a warehouse.<br/><br/>Their desire for revenge must have been so strong that they forgot to search him. If they did, they'd have found a small cellphone hidden on him.<br/><br/>Bryan then uses the device to talk with his daughter, and in the movie's most ingenious scene, he tells her to use a shoelace, pen and map to find his whereabouts.<br/><br/>Of yeah, he also tells her to lob a few grenades, thinking that no one in this huge historical city, which I visited two years ago, would notice the plumes of smoke and carnage caused his by travel activities.<br/><br/>Bryan escapes but not before there's running over the city's rooftops. Why is running on rooftops so popular in movies? It was also deemed necessary in Bourne Legacy and Total Recall recently.<br/><br/>Bryan then retraces his steps (using his extra-sensory powers, and the fortunate luck of hearing the same dogs barking and the same violinist playing) to find where he was hidden. Why would he do this? Wouldn't he have recognised the place he escaped from?<br/><br/>I'd have thought that the villains had learnt their lesson from Bryan escaping from their warehouse, but they're still nonchalant about it. For example, they're still engrossed in watching soccer on TV and one villain even turns his back towards the main gate while smoking. Heck, they didn't even lock it.<br/><br/>The film focuses quite a bit on Bryan and his family to allow our dear ex-CIA agent to go on a rampage without feeling guilty.<br/><br/>The editing is cut quickly and interspersed with fast music, including soaring violin tunes.<br/><br/>The action, including the shoot-outs, car chase and close combat, is ordinary.

"zardoz-13","8","3","7","6 October 2012"," There Is Nothing Like Being ""Taken 2"" The Limit and Beyond
","Writer and producer Luc Besson has said that the latest Liam Neeson abduction opus ""Taken 2"" won't spawn a sequel. Nevertheless, the prolific Parisian filmmaker might whistle a different tune after he scrutinizes the box office that this handy, white-knuckled thriller has drummed up. Since it debuted Friday, October 5th, ""Taken 2"" has taken twice as much as its exciting predecessor coined on its own opening day. Despite Besson's assurances to the contrary, co-scenarist Robert Mark Kamen and he have left ""Taken 2"" wide open for another sequel. Meantime, little has changed since 2009 when director Pierre Morel's ""Taken"" pitted retired CIA operative Bryan Mills against an Albanian-run white slavery ring operating out of Paris. This time around, Besson and Kamen have doubled the derring-do. Not only do the villains want to nab the daughter again, but they also want the father as well as his estranged wife. Director Olivier Megaton, who helmed ""Transporter 3"" and ""Columbiana,"" doesn't let anything stand in the way of Neeson as he shoots, stabs, and slugs his way through even more Albanians in this formulaic shoot'em up that never squanders a second of its pared down 91-minute running time. Although it isn't as suspenseful as the original ""Taken,"" ""Taken 2"" serves up more than enough outlandish action with some very obnoxious villains, including distinguished Croatian actor Rade Serbedzija, who take liberties with Neeson's co-star Famke Janssen. Chief among the assets of this sequel are its atmospheric Istanbul locations, particularly the Suleymaniye Mosque, the Grand Bazaar and the Bosphorus. Maggie Grace sprints across some impressive Turkish architecture with villains nipping at her heels while our hero plunges into some claustrophobic settings in search of his ex-wife.<br/><br/>""Taken 2"" opens as the coffins containing the corpses of the white slavers that Bryan Mills mowed down in ""Taken"" are taken back to Albania for burial. During the funeral, Murad Krasniqi (Rade Serbedzija of ""Batman Begins"") vows to wreak vengeance on Mills for slaying his good-for-nothing son as well as the sons of his dastardly relatives. As it turns out, Bryan (Liam Nesson of ""The A-Team"") has just completed a security job in Istanbul when his ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen of ""GoldenEye"") and his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace of ""Lockout"") surprise him with their presence. Although Lenore and Bryan are divorced, this doesn't keep Kim from playing Cupid when she sends them off together for their own sight-seeing tour of Istanbul. The fiendish villains aren't far behind. They strike at the motel where Kim is splashing about in a swimming pool. Surprisingly, they fail to nab Kim because her fleet-footed, fast-thinking father is a couple of steps ahead of them. Bryan alerts his daughter and tries to pack Lenore out of harm's way, too. Of course, complications arise. Murad's well-armed minions capture both Bryan and Lenore and hide them in the bazaar. Since he knows a thing or two about handling hard cases, Bryan isn't on ice long before he retaliates and takes down one Albanian after another with extreme prejudice. Predictably, Bryan saves the day, but not before the villains slash Lenore and suspend her upside down so that gravity is about to drain her of life, love, and the pursuit of happiness in a mere 30 minutes. None of this will do, and Bryan figures a way out of his predicament, but he cannot rescue his ex-wife as quickly as he would prefer. The villains haul Lenore off again, and our hero has to second guess them using what he saw and heard during their initial abduction to track them down.<br/><br/>Mind you, most of the repugnant villains behave like ten-pins in a bowling alley that our hero knocks down with absurd ease. What sets ""Taken 2"" apart from the conventional kidnap caper is Bryan's method of locating himself and his wife. After she escapes from her would-be abductors, Kim scrambles across rooftops slinging grenades so her father can triangulate his location for her and bring her to his rescue. She delivers an automatic pistol to him, and he starts slinging lead with no end in sight. When director Olivier Megaton isn't showing things from the perspective of the father, he stages several snap, crackle, pop action scenes that will make you squirm and wince. Make no mistake, ""Taken 2"" could have been twice as bloody as an R-rated thriller, but PG-13 nail-biters pull in bigger audiences. ""Taken 2"" will have you begging for a third!"

","This is one of the worst movies in movie history. The story has no content, does not make sense most of the time and relinquishes of logical coherence. None of the dialogs is remotely believable, not to speak of very bad acting by all main and secondary characters. One might say now that this is an action movie and contents are not that important... well, think twice cause fighting and action scenes aren't better one bit. And yes, Liam Nelson is playing a super hero, but please... he can't be that good. In most scenes, you can't even see, what is happening and miraculously he takes down all his opponents who seem to be brainless Romanians who have no talent whatsoever in fist fighting and shooting – even though with year long experience as mafia employees. This movie is a great disappointment. Yes you really need a talent to make it that bad!"

","Taken 2 was an opportunity missed to stretch Liam Neeson's character we all fell in love with, and further explore the gritty underground world of the first film. <br/><br/>Instead, the filmmakers have taken the original characters and plot line and produced a high concept, predictable revenge flick we're all too familiar with. The script felt cheap and rushed, their attempt to replicate the emotional journey of the first film was a complete failure. Ontop of that, the fighting choreography was so unbelievable that it does nothing but add black comedy to the film. <br/><br/>Taken 2 was made for a closed mind audience, a disgrace to real Taken fans. I can't help but wonder what the end result would have been like if the filmmakers stayed away from the family friendly safe road and attempted a serious and darker dark approach, in the likes of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo trilogy.<br/><br/>In the end, the sequel is nothing but a money machine and a parody of the first film."
"elmeeksio","7","2","4","16 October 2012"," Not as good as the first but still packs a punch!
","Lets get one thing straight first... TAKEN kicked ass! it was an unexpected powerhouse of a movie, with awesome fight scenes an a bad-ass lead character!<br/><br/>TAKEN 2 has to hold that weight on it's shoulder, everyone is expecting this to be as good if not better..and in my opinion it just falls short of expectation!<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, it's actually a really good movie, but i couldn't help thinking something was missing. <br/><br/>Positives: Liam Neeson kicks ass once again as Bryan Mills this time though it's he himself and his wife (the gorgeous Famke Janssen) that are 'taken' and daughter Kim is left to fend for herself. Maggie Grace is believable as the hardened version of the girl we met in the first movie, although still young she seems determined for the same thing that happened to her, to not happen again to her parents. The action is slick, and Neeson is as cool as in the first film. A particular car chase towards the end of the movie is worth pointing out as being pretty impressive.<br/><br/>Negatives: Try as they may, the whole film does have a 'seen it all before' feel to it. The plot is too similar to the first film, and at no point did i genuinely believe Mills or his wife were in any REAL danger. Some of the decisions made by the characters are ridiculous, and left me screaming at the screen ""Why the hell did he do that, is he an idiot!"" You'll understand what i mean when you see it! and the final thing that many reviewers have picked up on is the corniness of some of the dialogue. but i'm not going to dwell on that too much as i believe this is where the film actually shows a more humorous side and in a way i enjoyed it!<br/><br/>So overall i'd say this is definitely worth seeing whether you've seen the first movie or not. My only advice would be, don't go into the theatre with your expectations too high.. Just enjoy it for what it is."

","I remember quite liking the first ""Taken"" so I did have an interest in seeing the sequel. The law of diminishing returns is kicking in though now...and there might just be scope for at least two sequels given the events of this movie.<br/><br/>Anyway, the plot concerns the father of one of the slain people traffickers of the first movie seeking revenge for the carnage caused by ex C.I.A. officer Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson), who was ruthless in rescuing his daughter from a terrible fate in the first movie. The tables are somewhat turned in the sequel.<br/><br/>The first act of the movie is a rather lengthy depiction of a lot of nice people (Bryan, his ex-wife and their daughter)...which basically establishes that they don't deserve what is about to befall them and to justify the further actions Bryan will be forced to undertake (pun intended).<br/><br/>Seeing Bryan's old work buddies in this movie reminded me that they were in the first movie too...gosh, they must have had about two minutes worth of screen time for both movies! They're little more than plot devices in any case, which is overstating things!<br/><br/>One is reminded of the Death Wish movie franchise...in that series, the vigilante was forever avenging the murders of those closest to him...eventually he must surely have been avenging the grocer he shops at, right? Which is to say I wonder how many criminals Bryan can tick off to provide fodder for this series...and whether revisiting the premise will prove entertaining at all or just ridiculous.<br/><br/>I could have sworn I reviewed the first Taken here, but don't see it."

In Taken-2 however, he looks weak and vulnerable. The plot is good, Maggie Grace looks beautiful, the location of action perfect, but the action is very weak. The cameras move too fast and the Bryan Mills of Taken is missing from this movie. The ending itself is so sudden that you don't even realize how soon the movie ends.

"RockoutGlockout117","7","2","4","12 October 2012"," Taken Aback
","First off, let me just say something here, the first ""Taken"" film is not a masterpiece. I remember watching it the first time and thinking it was amazing, I watched it again a year later and was only mildly impressed, the number of logical inconsistencies in that film are mind blowing that being said I still enjoyed it. And in my opinion ""Taken 2"" is basically the same kind of film, you basically just forget the preposterousness of the situations and just go with it, and chances are you'll have a good time.<br/><br/>I'll have to say I was worried at first as the film was directed by Olivier Megaton known for directing the spectacularly bad ""Colombiana"" that was a film that asked you to turn you brain off and then beat you with stupidity so much your brain kept asking to be turned back on. The director's style is also a bit at fault here as he ruins some action sequences that are pretty awesome I imagine. Why do I ""Imagine"" and not know you ask? Because the director insists on cutting each shot so fast and shaking the camera like there is no tomorrow and sadly a lot of the action scenes are rendered nigh incomprehensible in this way. You basically just get the gist of the idea of whats going on, and that's after concentrating very hard on what you are watching. Thankfully however the film has enough cool moments to redeem this in my opinion. It has a cool car chase in which a ridiculous amount of shots are fired and property damage is caused. Its also got Liam Neeson which is always great. So basically let me break it down for you.<br/><br/>PROS Liam Neeson killing bad guys. An epic action sequence or two. A overall pretty good film. CONS Two much shaky/up close cam that makes it difficult to tell whats happening. One scene in particular has an explosion that is so blatantly edited in its just sad. The Main Villain's fate is just lame. Basically a retread of the original just with some details changed.<br/><br/>So as you can see this is just my opinion but I enjoyed ""Taken 2"" it was an entertaining if not original film. With a lot of gunshots and punches."
"Christian_Dimartino","8","2","4","9 October 2012"," I found it irresistible, but please don't make Taken 3.
","This is the case with most action movies: We all love the original, so much, that they bring us a sequel. The sequel is good, but not as good as the original, and from there, the series usually ends or keeps on going. That is the case with Die Hard, Lethal Weapon, Mission: Impossible, and most notably, James Bond.<br/><br/>But this is the problem with those: After a while, it gets really old, or ridiculous. Die Hard is starting to lose its gold, with a fifth movie coming out next year. There were a few times where James Bond has developed mold, the last time was Die Another Day. But thanks to that one, Bond came back with Casino Royale, his best adventure.<br/><br/>And with that, I lead us to Taken 2. Taken was a hit back in 2009, and it kick started the new improved career of now 60 year old Liam Neeson. I had a blast watching him annihilate the group of Albanians that captured his daughter Kim(Maggie Grace) and sent her off to the sex trade. It was wild, and though not a whole lot of story, it was good for what it was.<br/><br/>But when I read the info for Taken 2, I thought, ""Here we go again."" A movie like Taken, though enjoyable, doesn't need a sequel. But it's Hollywood, so they felt they must. I was going to see it regardless, but I didn't know if it were a good idea. It is, actually, a good idea, and luckily it is not that bad case of de ja vu that I was expecting. It is a rare sequel that is just as good as the original.<br/><br/>I don't know how long it has been since the events of the original, but nobody has quite shaken it off. Bryan(Neeson), the ex C.I.A man with those amazing ""set of skills"", is back, and he is still very protective of his daughter Kim and his ex wife Lenore(the sexy Famke Janssen), who is having marital problems of her own.<br/><br/>While doing some re-con work in Istanbul, Kim and Lenore fly over there for some family time. Big mistake. Little do any of them know that there are still a group of Albanians out there ticked off and looking for revenge. Bryan and Lenore are captured, leaving Kim defenseless... but of course her father is there for her even when he is being held captive. And we know he's not happy.<br/><br/>I had an undeniably good time at Taken 2. It's a lot of fun. Neeson is such a great action hero, and I think Taken was a blessing in disguise for him, and it is good to see that that blessing hasn't worn off. The action sequences, at times, drag on, but are nothing short of spectacular. Luckily, it is a bit different than its predecessor. Had it not been for that fact, Taken 2 might've been painful. But again, it reaches a problem in its last ten minutes: It hints at another movie. PLEASE STOP! Leave while you're on top. Trust me, it's for the best. Still, Taken 2 is just as good as the original.<br/><br/>B+"

","This movie made me feel confused, not from the plot but from the purpose of it.<br/><br/>The first movie was a great little thriller, introduced us to a world of sex traders who kidnap ex special agent Liam Neeson's daughter. This set up the thrilling and entertaining story that ensued. The first film also gave us a gritty view of beautiful Paris. The story and characters had substance, a purpose and we cared for them.<br/><br/>Therefore, did Taken 2 tarnish the reputation of the decent first installment and take the story too far? Should it have left it alone or should it have tried harder and taken it even further to dazzle us???<br/><br/>The theme for the second one is revenge. The relatives of all the people Liam killed in the first one are out for blood and want to kidnap Liam, Famke and Maggie this time, and bury them in their local town. <br/><br/>So they go to all the trouble (or no trouble at all - about three scenes worth of tracking) and eventually catch up with Liam and Family in Istanbul (whilst the over-protective Liam is on a security job for a rich Arab...hmm, not quite the smart, over-protective father after all!)<br/><br/>Anyway, they easily kidnap Liam and Famke, but leave him tied to a pipe with cable ties and a mobile phone (which they forgot to frisk him for!) <br/><br/>So, the clichéd inevitable happens and Liam breaks free, right after having a lengthy phone call to his daughter and give her directions to find him and give him a gun!!! <br/><br/>Liam then 'relatively safely' gets his daughter to the US embassy and goes back for his wife and easily takes out these 'useless bad guys'. <br/><br/>He even tries to reason with the bad guy and gives him a chance to stop hunting for him. But the bad guy tries to kill Liam so he manages to stick his head in a coat hanger. (Oh yeah, before that the bad guy mentions he also has two sons who will also want revenge too!!!)<br/><br/>Let me guess Taken 3????? I hope not, lets just remember the first one for its greatness and with the second one, you can take it or leave it, I would suggest the latter!!!"

","Taken 2 is as expected cut to pieces to get a 12A rating. Do not bother to see this film in the cinema. A film company allowing a sequel to an adult action film (which was rated 18) to be savaged in order to get children to see it is just a lesson in corporate greed. In doing so they have now lost this patron from here on. I will no longer go to see a 12A - I don't care what it is! <br/><br/>Taken 2 is so cut that you have no idea how Liam Neeson manages to overcome about half his opponents. For example I honestly had no idea that pressing someone's face back so that their head is against a wall will actually kill them! Wow! That's some Ninja crap, surely... No, it's just badly cut action. It wasn't even one of the schizophrenic epileptic-having-a-fit so-close-to-the-action that-you-can't-see what- the-hell-is-going-on action scenes - and there are many of those.<br/><br/>I knew the story would be convoluted and it would stretch plausibility beyond... well okay it was always going to be vaguely plausible at best. If it wasn't marred by badly shot fight scenes and badly cut action in those fight scenes then it could be mildly enjoyable. Unfortunately, this little escapade has probably killed the franchise. <br/><br/>There are many things wrong with the film, Neeson struggling to use a minuscule mobile phone instead of trying to escape his ties when later it takes him no time at all to get through the ties, there's also the length of time he spends on this phone. But its main problems are the cuts and the action being shot by a dwarf with vertigo. I get dizzy enough without this idiotic misuse of a camera. You seriously could not get anything worse if you gave the camera to a six-year-old. Will someone please teach directors how to shoot action again? Please......... ?"

It wasn't until much later when I watched all three of those movies.<br/><br/>This one is decent. It has some good action, an okay story and as always great acting. The plot revolves around Bryan Mills taking his family to Istanbul, unaware that the kidnappers' family and friends from the first movie are hatching a revenge plan for them.

The bad guy may look menacing but he's a bit underused and there isn't really a concluding battle between Bryan and him. But there are some great themes about vengeance and evil woven in, especially in that final scene.<br/><br/>There's also subplots that expand on the characters a bit, like Kim finding romance in her life and Bryan meeting the boyfriend.

","This review contains spoilers.<br/><br/>Taken 2 is the sequel to 2008's Taken. The movie is an action thriller film that is directed by Olivier Megaton and written by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen. The movie takes place some time after the first Taken movie and stars the same cast. The movie has the Albanians from the first movie returning to exact revenge on Bryan Mills and his family.<br/><br/>Taken 2 features the tight action from the original movie in its 91 minute running time. This time however, the money is not as fresh or intelligently executed. Bryan Mills and his wife are taken which causes his daughter to assist in their rescue. The entire movie feels so contrived as the movie finds reasons to continue the running time. The story's beginning feels like a terrible introduction. The Albanians want revenge and nothing else. They decide to take the entire family when they know Bryan was separated from his wife. It is an amazingly contrived situation that the Mills family decided to go on a vacation in Istanbul when the Albanians sought revenge.<br/><br/>This is not the only deficiency in the writing. The writing has strange scenes. Somehow Bryan Mills carries around high explosive grenades in his briefcase. The grenades are used for Bryan to find the location where he is kidnapped. This scene has grenades being thrown into public areas in Istanbul to utilize sound location. This scene is not the only immersion breaking scene. The movie has Bryan Mills, and his daughter drive into the United States embassy as they are being shot at. For some reason, the movie thought that this was the best option rather than have the scene play out normally. These scenes changed how I will see the Taken franchise. There is simply so many poorly executed scenes that hold down the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson is still great in the role of Bryan Mills. I do not see any large flaws except the ridiculous scenes he became involved in. He did a good job but I wish he had stopped the ridiculous scenes from playing out. It made the movie tough to watch.<br/><br/>I would not recommend 'Taken 2.'<br/><br/>Grade: D"

Inevitably there are a fair few clichés just once when a bad guy is given the opportunity to walk away rather than try to kill the hero will he make the sensible choice?!

'Taken 2' pushes the boundaries of credibility at many points (Neeson triangulating various locations) and it is not quite as well-paced as the first entry with half an hour of exposition before the action truly ignites, however, it is not a worthless sequel by any stretch of the imagination. The writers build up rapport between Liam Neeson and Maggie Grace as estranged father and daughter very well, and there is something quite amusing in how she does eventually get a long awaited real driving lesson from him late in the piece. The film's attempt to reverse the formula of the first film works surprisingly well too as she follows instructions from Neeson via cellular phone of how to rescue him. 'Taken 2' also acknowledges Neeson's callousness for the first time, and how with the Albanians he ""killed them all like they were so many nothings"" - a refreshing moral stance almost completely absence from the original film. The script is far from perfect though with the sudden reconciliation between Famke Janssen and Neeson seeming like a mere plot device, not to mention many improbabilities, but it is a surprisingly gripping watch and Neeson is as sympathetic as ever as a man out to protect his family whatever the cost. 'Taken 2' is may not necessarily be a superior motion picture to Part One, but it is a lot more interesting than one might expect."

However, the last film has left Neeson with a heap of enemies who want revenge for all of the dead bodies left lying across Paris, including one that was left to die with electricity flowing through his body. Mind you, these people don't care that their sons were running a sex slave operation, they just want revenge.<br/><br/>I'm not really sure if I can say anything more about this movie because, as I have said, it is basically Liam Neeson running around Istanbul leaving a trail of destruction and dead bodies. Okay, the plot is slightly different because he and his wife are the ones that are taken, and for a while his daughter is the one trying to rescue him. Mind you, I have noticed that there are a number of criticisms about this movie (such as being able to toss grenades around Istanbul without attracting attention), but it is still one of those movie where you are supposed to clear your mind and watch Lian Neeson run round doing what his character does best."

","I really didn't like the movie.. It had no dynamic like the first one.. Some parts were lame for example; Kim has no license but in İstanbul she is able to use non automatic car and a very professional way.. I hate how they showed my city and my people in the movie.. Turkey is not look like a 3rd world country especially İstanbul is not an Arabic city.. We are living men and women together in the streets and work and we are not wearing black full body and face covers. <br/><br/>Some people are wearing turban, so that means they cover their heads with scarf it's not something they show in the movie. We are Democratic country and İstanbul is a very cosmopolitan city. We have modern police cars even the Toyota Hibrit ones, and city is like a mixture old and new..

","I quite liked Taken 2 because of its pacing, estranged father- daughter conflict and a few other things that I will talk about later on in my critic review even though that movie did in fact lack its full potential! The problem with the movie is that there isn't any Liam Neeson awesomeness, there is no slick action, the pacing though good lacks some urgency, the film lacks fast-moving editing, the main villain doesn't get enough screen time and finally something I didn't mention in my first Taken critic review is that I'm not entirely satisfied with the casting of I DON'T REMEMBER HER NAME as Kim because she was KINDA weird looking a BIT and the filmmakers should have chosen an actress with a COMPLETELY beautiful face to play Kim! I've wondered to myself how can a director make such mistakes, mistakes in a movie which are so easy to avoid but then I've learned from my brother that sometimes it is just because some directors think or believe that people after having seen a first exciting movie don't want to see the same stuff as in the first movie in the second movie again and that does make sense. Yes, it does make sense but it depends in which direction you're taking this statement (bring in change to a sequel) toward! What I mean by this is that does it still mean that when you're trying to bring change in a sequel you have to show inferior action in comparison to the first movie!? Hein!? Why not just simply think of taking the action to a higher standard level in the first place hein!? It's obvious and I'm surprised that the director hasn't thought of that already! Or perhaps who knows the director thought of that but he felt and/or thought that it was too challenging for him to do! Nonetheless, the film does a few good things which improve upon the original and one of them is the character of Kim. I really like the fact that she has fallen in love for the first time in her life and that she has also become immature (but still kind) and that she doesn't answer to calls and is being secretive to her father, and also the idea of her father chasing her around to get her to pass her driving test and that fits smoothly well for a sequel continuing to explore an estranged father-daughter relationship. Something I've noticed however is that Liam Neeson's character is never shown to be annoyed at Kim. It would have been better if he was shown to get annoyed at her in order to make the father-daughter conflict stronger. I hope Taken 3 will learn from the first sequel's mistakes IF the filmmakers read the negative reviews on Taken 2 by the critics and audience and that it manages to improve upon both Taken and Taken 2! I'm looking forward to seeing Taken 3 or should I rather say Tak3n? Tak3n definitely sounds better! My rating for Taken 2 is 7.0/10"

","How can the same sh*t happen to the same guy twice? get a new line of work maybe. Neeson is back and he's badder than before, well not really but he still kicks ass at his ripe old age and he hasn't forgotten his black leather coat either.<br/><br/>Follow up to the very good original and your first thoughts are is this really needed? The first film was a kind of slick 'Ronin' kick ass machine but can you really do the same again without it being a rehash? well yes and no.<br/><br/>Its a nice idea that we see the aftermath of what the hero did in the last film. He kills all the bad guys and saves the day, but what about those baddie henchmen he bagged? what about their families and friends? no one really wonders how they would feel and its not been explored too much. So this plot about one particular bad guys family (father) wanting revenge on Neeson's character is kinda neat but also kinda stretched. If you think about it the concept could just go on and on, every bad guy killed having one of their family members coming after the hero for revenge.<br/><br/>There are quite a few silly moments in this film I must admit. For a start Neeson's character works out where he is pretty quickly after he's been kidnapped. So before you know it he's contacted his daughter with his trusty batphone thingy hidden in his sock (of course) and well on the way to be rescued, job done, film over then.<br/><br/>The sequence where he instructs his daughter to throw grenades left right n centre so he can listen for the explosion and calculate where he is, is also rather daft. Surely live grenades going off in downtown Istanbul might raise some alerts? wouldn't anyone hear this? if Mills can hear it in his dank prison surely other folk at street level can hear it no?<br/><br/>That also leads to the fact that when Mills is kidnapped it appears that he and his wife are driven quite a long distance away, possibly out of the city. We then learn through the grenade throwing sequence that he is in fact not very far away a tall, almost around the corner actually. His daughter can virtually see where he's been taken from the rooftop for gods sake!<br/><br/>Then there is the car chase which again is very 'Ronin' like in style and visuals. Now this chase is actually very good and very well done, I enjoyed it a lot, kudos. Thing is, Mills daughter can't drive, we know this from earlier in the film. Americans tend to drive automatic cars, the Merc they both escape in is a manual, but somehow this doesn't stop Mills daughter managing to drive this Euro manual like a rally driver through the narrow bustling streets of Istanbul.<br/><br/>Oh and Mills manages to find his wife pretty quickly and easily towards the end too, just a stroll in the park, blip! your dead. Unfortunately we also discover that the main bad guy Murad has two sons who will come after Mills if he is killed, so I guess that's 'Taken 3' then.<br/><br/>Despite all the silly bits and the fact the whole plot is weak and not really important, I did actually enjoy this film quite a bit. The visuals are glossy with good editing, sound and camera work, score does the trick nicely and of course the acting isn't too shabby either. I have read a lot of negative reviews for this film but I can't see why really. Sure its not as good or original as the first film but you get what you pay for. <br/><br/>Neeson bitch slapping balding unshaven Eastern European bad guys, a slamming car chase and all created with smooth eye popping French (yes French!) va va voom. <br/><br/>7/10"

","You know what you're getting into here – the families of the many, many men that Bryan Mills killed while trying to get his daughter back in the previous film. The title doesn't suggest anything new will occur here since it is presented without subtitle or addition other than the usual numeric addition and this is representative of a film that knows it has to deliver action sequences and violence, but really seems to lack the energy to do it in a way that offers much. We jump right into the plot setup, then get the characters where we need them before then starting a run of driving, fighting and shooting sequences.<br/><br/>In terms of just mindlessly doing stuff, the film is not awful and those looking for boxes to be ticked will find them done here – if indeed that is the only request. The first film was not some high art but it had good pace and, although it struggled to link action scenes, it was not totally stupid. In this one very little effort has been made and even when dumb ideas were said out loud in the writer's room, it was clear nobody cared enough to at least try to find something that made sense. The examples are many but my personal favorite is when Bryan and Kim has eluded their pursuers and are heading to the US Embassy for safety – instead of pulling up outside, they decide to ram it with the car so they are 100% inside the Embassy grounds; okay this gives the film another short stunt sequence, however it also makes no sense at all. This sort of stupidity is annoying and even in the moment doesn't work – this isn't a film where you think back later about the stupid narrative, it is a film that you'll do it all the time during.<br/><br/>This is a problem because such nonsense breaks the viewer out of the film and stop you just getting into the pace and action; maybe not a big deal if it was occasional but when it is frequent then you have to wonder. The action itself is okay although shot a bit too frantically at times, the problem is that you are never allowed to forget how stupid it all is – and the film really needs to let us do that. The cast seem stuck with it all; Neeson looks a bit bored of it all even though his reinvention as an action hero must be earning him quite a nice crust (hence he will be back yet again for a third Taken). Grace is okay from her side, but the narrative sees her failing her driving test in an automatic but then suddenly able to drive a manual like a rally driver; Janssen is a pretty plot device throughout and generally the generic villains are totally unmemorable whether they are a guy we see for a few seconds, or the main ones.<br/><br/>Taken 2 is a film that exists because of economics – the first one made so much money that even with the potential sequel takings drop-off, it still makes sense to make it. This is the main motivation and it shows because everything else feels function and ""good enough"", although the problem is that often it isn't. It will provide noise for the background but the nonsense and lazy writing really detracts from it."

It goes on and on.<br/><br/>But what really put this film into the toilet were scenes that I call ""convenient overlooks"". For example, bad guys are after the daughter who is hiding in a closet. Bad guys check one closet door, then start to sloooowwwly open the other door, but then get distracted and stop. Whew that was close! Another: Bad guys use a breakable zip tie to tie Neeson's wrists together, they ever heard of handcuffs? Another: Bad guys leave Neeson alone in a room so he has time to talk to his daughter via a hidden cell phone and plan his escape.

","Films that don't need or can't realistically accommodate a sequel are hashed out all the time, and Taken is no exception. The film reinvented Liam Neeson as a late-in-life action hero (despite having a few successful action films earlier in his career) and was a surprise hit at the box office thanks to its neutered PG-13 rating. A harder cut surfaced on Blu-ray, and the famous monologue of Neeson threatening the kidnappers on the phone entered pop culture, giving the studio hope that a sequel would do big business. The gamble worked, and the sequel took more money than the first. Is it any good? I expected the worst, but I actually prefer this movie to the first.<br/><br/>Made four years later, but set unspecified years later, Bryan Mills and infantile daughter Kim are still getting over their disastrous trip to Paris (where you are guaranteed to to be kidnapped and sold into sexual slavery, so don't even think about it). Former-bitch former-wife Lenore is now back in love with Bryan and surprises him on his last day of a Budapest assignment by showing up at the hotel. New trip, new disaster. Will the Mills family ever learn to stay at home in America where nothing ever bad ever happened to anyone? The daddy of the evil kidnapper in the first movie has somehow managed to find Mills and has an army of lowlifes (all of them dressing in dirty 1980s clothes that seemed to have washed-up in a lost container on a Yugoslavian beach some time in 1991) willing to sacrifice their existence for the most arbitrary of reasons (untaxed pay and the boss' approval). Mills and wife are quickly kidnapped and it's up to Kim to rescue them and let him loose to kill, kill, kill the evil foreign men.<br/><br/>I found this film to be more exciting and the danger was ramped-up. It lacks the variety of locations of the first movie (almost every scene is set in a dark alley), and there are some ludicrous plot contrivances (Mills' CIA pals fixing everything with a phonecall or the fact that Jean-Claude still has the same job despite his massive corruption being exposed) but it moves fast enough to make it a non-issue. The action is hard-hitting and Neeson is still a force to be reckoned with as he effortlessly dominates the movie with his presence."

","Another film on secret agents life. That one comes closer to reality by involving wife and daughter having no affair in the killing of the Albanian mafia - acting in Istanbul son, by the protagonist agent (Liam Neeson). The movie gains the impressions by showing old Istanbul's city, it's tiled roofs, the mosques, it's narrow streets, also the luxurious hotels - the ambiance of the city in general, showing in general very impressive panoramic pictures of the entire city. It looses by showing a very cruel aspect, of Albanian mafia who resides there - saying that is the first time I hear about this. The torture scenes are absolutely awful. Also the plan dictated from mobile to his daughter who is in the hotel room - consisted on drawing on his map in his suitcase, to find the location where his his captured, followed by daughter's escape from the hotel, the throwing of the grenades, her desperate run on the roofs, to avoid her persecutors, in order to find her captured parents, is absolutely complicated as mythical - on the other hand, suspensive and impressive. In general all scenes of that movie, are very well filmed and capture the interest of the spectator. Above all the acting of Liam Neeson makes the difference. With his low voice, his persuasive obstinacy showing to his daughter on his aim to save his wife from his persecutors, his perfect skills of beating his adversaries - as he himself, says to her, that ""This is his my job!"", makes a good choice of seeing that movie."

","In 2008 Taken was a surprise hit and made Liam Neeson a surprising action hero with him ending up getting him many action gigs. Taken was a cheap to make, so a sequel made business sense, leading to Taken 2, a definition of a money grabbing sequel.<br/><br/>A year after the events of Taken, an Albanian gangster/clan leader (Rade erbedija) wants revenge for the death of his son in Paris and sends out his operatives to find the man who did it. Bryan Mills (Neeson) has taken a bodyguard job in Istanbul, when his ex-wife, Lenny (Famke Janssen) and daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace) surprise him in the Turkish city. But this when the Albanians plan to strike, kidnapping Bryan and Lenny, forcing Bryan to guide Kim to save them.<br/><br/>Taken 2 is hilarious and that is certainly not what the sequel was aiming for. It was also like the film was written to be a parody but directed to be deadly serious as this is a film that incredibly stupid. Some glorious moments include Bryan finding Kim with a GPS he put in her phone, Kim having to throw grenades off rooftops in a major city, Kim certainly becoming a skilled stunt driver and Kim and Bryan clashing through the American Embassy's entrance. We get the bad guy doing something so dumb that it may as well be a parody because they capture the highly trained Bryan and leave him alone in a locked room alone so they can watch a football match. Kill him, you have won, or if you want to torture him, break his arms and legs so he can't escape.<br/><br/>Olivier Megaton takes over the directing duties from Pierre Morel. His career has been lacklustre despite his awesome name. Taken 2 was rated PG-13 in North America when the first was R-rated. It was a neutered experience with the violence cut and Megaton was not an interesting action director. Most the action is bland, with him relying on shaky cam and quick editing. Megaton certainly cannot shoot an fight scene if it involves more than two characters as you will get lost with what is happening and where people are. The car chase and rooftop chases are decent enough though and the final fight was eligible simply because it was two people fighting.<br/><br/>This was clearly a paycheck film for most of the actors involved, with Neeson looking disinterested and Janssen was giving the thankless role of being kidnapped and tortured. erbedija also had a thankless role as the generic Eastern European villain and was wasted considering actually had a smart way to continue the story. But it was Grace who was the worst performer in the film; she is too old for to play a teenager and her delivery is awful, particularly when she is meant to be scared.<br/><br/>In Taken both Albanians and the French were portrayed in a bad light. Istanbul at least does not look like a city of prevents and corruption, but this is hardly highlighting the city as it shown as a rundown, decaying city compared to the clean, orderly, modern world of Los Angeles. This is not aided that Istanbul was shot with a grey/green filter that makes the city look even worst.<br/><br/>Taken 2 is a copy and paste sequel of the first film but given a twist that is more like a parody. It is a sequel that did not need to be made and if a third film is made (which is scarily likely) I would love to know what city and country is going to get insulted next. I would be highly surprised that Kim would even want to leave her bedroom after her experiences when she left American soil."

And the scene switches to Istanbul with - as in ""Skyfall"" - action sequences on the roof of the Grand Bazaar.<br/><br/>It is entertaining enough but lacks the punch and the iconic speech of the original movie.

","""If the dog has a bone, the last thing you want to do is take it from him.""<br/><br/>Well, a need for revenge exists in an Albanian mobster, Murad Krasniqi (Rade Serbedzija), vowing to get even with the man who killed his son. Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) is in Istanbul, protecting a sheik, about to return to the States after performing his duty, greeted surprisingly by his daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace) and ex-wife, Lenore (Famke Janssen), deciding to accept his invite to join him in Turkey for this temporary assignment. Murad and his men arrive in Istanbul with one goal, to kidnap Bryan and his family with plans to execute them all. Bryan is to be tortured and die miserably but not before seeing his wife hung upside down, a slight cut on her neck bleeding out as the rush to her head eventually leads to deaththat was Murad's plan anyway. Funny thing about fighting machines like Bryan Millsthey don't just go down according to plan.<br/><br/>The Turkish setting (the rooftops, streets, and old buildings) allows for some excitingly fresh environs, but I have to say that the story goes through the motions, with little time for Liam Neeson the actor to pull us into his emotional crisis. Because there never seems to be a fear that his wife or daughter will perish at the hands of Murad and his Albanian thugs, and Bryan leaves their potential for harm freed from his mind so he can equip himself with the resolve and mental functioning needed to rescue them, Neeson barely has time to even scratch the surface of his acting capabilities and convey the turmoil that should exist in such a dire situation. <br/><br/>I think the film's fundamental flaw, however, is the insistence to infuse Maggie Grace into the action; her driving the taxi cab through the populated (and narrow) streets of Istanbul like a trained stuntwoman (despite father's nagging about ""speed up"", ""gogo..go"", and ""turn rightnow!""), leaping across rooftops like an Olympic champion, and successfully coordinating a perimeter based on Bryan's instructions without a hitch all seem questionable and hard to swallow. And the need for Grace to portray a teenager when she's nearly as old as me (she was born in '83 for crying out loud!), attempting to get her driver's license and dating a boy much to papa's chagrin, is really ridiculous.<br/><br/>While I loved watching Neeson go to work because it's ""what he does best"", I do believe this should be his second and final film in the role; seeing him with so little to work with (while Damon in the Bourne movies was equipped with some finely realized emotional scenes) was rather frustrating to me. It is cool, sure, to see him walk into a room of thugs and out, them dead in less than 45 seconds, but the film poster offers so much more than Neeson ever gets a chance to provide (sitting in a grueling slumped position of agony and exhaustion, having time to contemplate what's happened, the film doesn't afford him such a luxury). Janssen has a tiny bit of time to openly express her second marriage's crumbling to a sympathetic Bryan, but she's primary held captive in a room with Murad and others threatening her (Murad says he will send her back home in pieces), while Grace insists on helping Daddy get her back. Eventually though, the film allows Bryan to shake off his daughter and take care of the bad guys with his superior fighting skills (hand to hand combat and an exchange of gun fire) and quick reflexes. The film hums when we see bullets almost hit Bryan (who has just enough presence of mind to move in the nick of time) and Bryan use his surroundings as weapons of destruction. Walls and floors are unforgiving when Bryan bounces your body and head off of them with his swift accuracy and sharp martial arts skills. For whatever reason, though, the story itself (or the characters really) never quite match the scenes where Bryan annihilates his foes. It isn't a fault I could blame on Neeson, Janssen, or Gracethe situation they are flung into gives little time (besides hitting the basic points of where the characters are in their lives with seconds-long dialogue scenes) for character development. It becomes a matter of survival and rescue. The taxi cab car chase, leaving behind a lot of vehicular and city structural damage, is a doozy, though. Murad's son may've died horribly at Bryan's hands (thanks to a seated electrocution), but there's very little sympathy for someone kidnapping girls and sending them off to be sex slaves, so the revenge angle is relatively weak...it does give Bryan a reason to wipe out some more lowlifes, so I guess that's all that was needed. This film follows closer to the action films of the 80s where logic and realism take a back seat to bodies smashing and cars crashing, so that alleviates some of the impact an actor of Neeson's caliber can bring to Taken 2. Like others, I view this as a missed opportunity, but its strengths are exciting."

","The first Taken movie is excellent in every way, it builds up to its climax nicely and the climax itself is very satisfying after all Mills goes through. Taken 2 is very rushed in that aspect. It is barely 90 minutes long and by the time Mills and his wife are taken, it seems a very short time before the credits are rolling. Some more problems I had were that it was centered around Mills and his wife being taken and not the daughter but Mills is taken for about 10 minutes and then escapes easily. His daughter was working on trying to pass her driving test back in the states after having failed it multiple times, so naturally she could drive a stick-shift like a pro huh?<br/><br/>I give it a 6 because it is somewhat fun to watch despite the flaws I have with it.

","I hate when reading through reviews it seems as if for most of the people there is nothing between super-good or super-bad. Everyone calling this the worst movie of any year clearly doesn't have any idea what a really bad film looks like. Is the movie a money-grab? Propably. Does it have a really good script? No. Is the script terrible? Of course not. Is the acting bad? No way! It's just not as good as the ""innovative"" (as far as a movie can be innovative nowadays) stuff shown in Taken. You get more or less the same basic characters and protagonists and the antagonists seek revenge this time instead of just looking for girls to sell them for profit. While the action is - like in every blockbuster - as far from believable as it can get, Liam Neeson (as always) shows exactly what we expect him to do: God-like skill in making human lives miserable and killing everyone in his path. Never judge a movie on 1 star reviews, Taken 2 is just maybe not worth being bought on DVD which doesn't make it a bad movie. Watch it once if you can see it on TV, that's all."

","This review is essentially just my thoughts on this movie.<br/><br/>So assuming you saw TAKEN you know that Kim, the girl in TAKEN 2 was kidnapped and sold into sexual slavery when her and her friend went to France for a vacation after high school so then her Dad rescued them. Now what I don't get about this sequel is that apparently Kim had such a traumatic time in Europe - which is established early in this movie – then why on earth would she ever set foot in Europe again. Like if that happened to me, you can bet I would never ever ever travel to Europe again, and like never travel internationally again either. Yet in this movie Kim just is so quick to hop a plane with her mother (another unlikely person to travel or allow her daughter to travel) and go to not only Europe but Turkey of all places. The place where her kidnappers in France were from because they had Turkish C-Star tattoos on their hands. Never mind the fact that not a whole lot of time has actually passed from the time the girl got kidnapped in the first movie and goes to Turkey in this one. This is a pretty bad oversight on the story writers behalf.<br/><br/>So for this reason alone I found that this movie simply is unbelievable and pretty boring. Taken was a great movie that was interesting, scary and suspenseful. Where as Taken 2 really and honestly never needed to be made. If you agree with my thought on this movie please click you found this review helpful. This is all I am going to say on this movie."

Once again, Mills must use all the skills he's acquired to protect himself and those he loves.<br/><br/>Maybe it's just me, but I've noticed a bit of a slump in really interesting looking films coming out lately, which may explain why I added this sequel to a film I thought was quite over rated in the first place to my rental list. But, as much as people loved the first film, so they were quite disappointed with this sequel, in fact most downright hating it. My only reaction was to find it as piecemeal as the first film, with Neeson going through the motions again, doing pretty much what he did in the first film again, while the action is filmed at too close up a range, with an unrealistic looking Istanbul as the location. Rade Serbedzija's villain is probably the best thing in it, though with limited screen time. Then again, it's very short and sweet, which makes it inoffensive enough not to be a total stinker. **"

","TAKEN released in 2008 was a tightly woven thriller that boosted Liam Neeson's already burgeoning career: he was a killer's killer and managed to garner acclaim from critics and audiences alike. Now we have a sequel (and there may be more, as the end of the film suggests) that just isn't up to the same standard as the original, but for those who saw Part 1, then Part 2 will likely not disappoint.<br/><br/>The film opens in Albania where the old father Murad Krasniqi (Rade Serbedzija) is burying his son and some villagers killed by Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) and he vows revenge. Switch to Los Angles where we see Bryan and his ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen), who is recuperating from her second divorce, and their daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) who is entering her first relationship with Jamie (a promising Luke Grimes) arguing over priorities. Bryan still loves Kim and Lenore and when Lenore tearfully confesses her frustration that her plans to take Kim to China to regroup emotionally have fallen through, Bryan announces he has a job in Istanbul, Turkey - 3 days worth - and invites them to join him after his job is complete. But of course in Istanbul Bryan's mission involves offing all the people from the Albanian crew and when Lenore and Kim arrive the family is re-bonded until Murad directs that all three be captured and killed. From there it is the predictable cat and mouse games of capture/escape/killing by every means possible/ car chases action and the few who are left in the end make a pact of sorts...and more need not be said.<br/><br/>Oliver Megaton directs a screenplay by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen. One of the glories of the film is the opportunity to see the many sites of Istanbul.

","I enjoyed this movie as a no-brainer action/thriller flick. Sure, it has a bunch of illogical and idiotic elements in but I have seen a lot worse. The movie certainly do not deserve the ridiculously low ratings that some people have given it.<br/><br/>It is perhaps not as good as the first movie, mostly due to the silly bits and pieces, but as a plain vanilla action/thriller it is certainly passable. I generally do like Liam Neeson. I did like him in the first Taken movie and I do like him in this one. The other actors with the possible exception of his wife and daughter are mostly there to fill up the scenes.<br/><br/>After a semi-dull beginning which is pretty much just setting up a reason for them all being in Istanbul, Bryan and his wife is, surprise, surprise, taken and that is pretty much when the action starts and from there on it is pretty much action all the way.<br/><br/>As have been mentioned, there are a lot of stupid things happening in the movie. Dropping grenades in the middle of Istanbul seemingly without anyone really reacting for instance. Bryan's daughter have failed to take a drivers licence in the states several times but still, when thrown into a car with a manual gear stick, she handles the car like a stunt driver. Then we have a violin player that sits in the same spot all the time? Not to mention crashing into the embassy while being fired upon by the embassy marine guards and then they can just sit there in the wrecked car, in front of the embassy, while Bryan calls for help from some guy playing golf in the states.<br/><br/>It is clear that the Luc Besson didn't really put realism very high on his agenda for this movie. But then this wouldn't be the first time for him. Overlook the silliness and you have a decent enough action/thriller flick. At least I enjoyed it and I am normally not too forgiving when it comes to stupid and unrealistic stuff in movies."

The US Marines at the gate shot up their little car with a .50 cal but somehow left it fully intact! RIDICULOUS!!! Another thing was that when he was trying to go back and save his wife he was somehow able to retrace his steps in such record time that the bad guys couldn't even walk out of their own building with his wife before he showed up.

","OK, just to make it clear, as an action movie, Taken 2 is still pretty solid, it got everything most fans of the gender will like, car chase, fist fight, gun fight, you name it, its in here. But at the same time... did Taken really needed a sequel? Pretty much, was it hard to just star Liam Neeson into another ""bad ass"" action movie instead? This movie felt forced from the start, from the whole father want to avenge his son, even if he kidnap womens to be raped and sold, the whole honour factor seemed forced as hell. And as many as mentioned, the age of the daughter's actress really start to show, its hard to make her pass like a teen again, and even Liam himself, kinda looked older in it from many different angles.<br/><br/>But on an action point of view, the movie deliver. It got everything a fan of action movies is expecting, and as the movie ended, i was like ""wait wait, is that the end already?"" and checked the time left on my DVD to realize yeah... the generic is coming. I guess its a good sign to show the movie is not boring... or maybe it has too much character development at the start... when in the end we already knew those characters...? Its been a while since i saw Taken, i will re watch it soon, but i felt Liam was way more ""bad ass"" in the first movie, both in speeches, in action, how angry he was, how brutal he was, he looked way older also in this(still 5 years later) and some fight scene remembered me of some latest Seagal movies... with weird camera angle to cover up the stunt double...<br/><br/>Maybe in the end its more or less because Taken was just a nice surprise, a movie i saw in theatre because i wanted to skip school and there was nothing else good on that Friday noon... and it turned out to be awesome. But in any case, a sequel to that movie was just SOOOOOO NOOOOT necessary.<br/><br/>But at least it turned out OK and entertaining, but Taken 2 is far from being Taken 1 to me... it ain't as ""bad ass""...and just feel sadly as a cash in sequel... not really bringing much to the first movie."
"jj_spicer","5","0","0","8 March 2013"," Average action film.
","The original Taken took everyone by surprise by being a fairly decent action adventure. It also thrust Liam Neeson into the role of an action movie star, something you wouldn't have picked a few years ago. The plot was simple, but well executed, combined good action with a solid effort from Neeson.<br/><br/>Taken 2 really, to be honest, feels like Taken, but with no step up. When you make a sequel, if you want it to stand out and excel on the first film, you need to step it up. Whether it be a better story line, or better action sequences, better performances. But Taken 2 really delivers on none of these fronts. In fact, I suspect that had this not been the sequel to the original, this would be a straight to DVD effort.<br/><br/>This time out sees Bryan Mills (Neeson) head to Istanbul (and I'm not sure they did Turkey's tourism office any favours here), and the plot flows on from the first film. The relatives of Mills' victims from his previous exploits through Europe are now seeking revenge. This time, both his wife (Famke Janssen) and daughter (Maggie Grace) are both caught up in the chaos, with gunfights, car chases and fisticuffs flowing regularly.<br/><br/>As I said before though, nothing really gets stepped up in this. The plot line is pretty simple. Whilst the first was no Shakespearean effort, you at least delved a little bit into the underground of Europe's nasty side, and however clichéd it was, there was a little character development before the bullets started flying. This time, it's simply good vs bad guys, with the backdrop of Istanbul providing nothing but fly-over helicopter shots and your typical touristy vistas of mosques.<br/><br/>The violence is taken down a notch. I don't know whether this was for ratings purposes or not, but there's none of the brutality of Mills character in the first. It's all pretty ho-hum. The action scenes are likewise. I do find it funny that a girl who's meant to be struggling to do parallel parking can do handbrake turns the next minute, but that's the sort of things the director is probably hoping you'll miss.<br/><br/>No characters in it are developed to any great degree. Neeson is pretty one dimensional as Mills, whilst Grace and Janssen are merely plot aids. The customary bad guy, played by Rade Serbedzija, is merely motivated by revenge, and given no chance to be any more than just the inevitable nemesis for the climactic scene.<br/><br/>For a film backed by Luc Besson, you'd have hoped for a little more. The first one maybe did so well because everyone thought it'd be terrible, when in fact it was pretty decent. This one, you hoped, would hit the same heights. Sadly, it doesn't. I'd say it'd be a pretty safe guess that number 3 won't be on its way anytime soon. Unless of course, this does well at the box office. In which case, you can probably bet on it."

","After having had lots of fun watching the tough and fast moving first Taken,I was pleased to discover that the second movie in the series has just been brought out on DVD,which lead to me getting ready to find out who Bryan Mills takes on this time.<br/><br/>The plot:<br/><br/>Arriving to his ex-wife Lenore's house so that he can give their daughter Kim (who he a few years ago rescued from being kidnapped) a driving lesson,former covert operative Bryan Mills finds out that his daughter has forgotten about the appointment,due to instead deciding to pay a visit to the house where her new boyfriend lives,a boyfriend who she has not told her dad about.<br/><br/>Fearing that a gap is developing between himself and Kim,and also feeling saddened over Lenore being up set over her current partner leaving her,Mills decides that the best way to deal with all of the troubles that he and his ex-wife are facing,is for all of them to go on a relaxing holiday to Turkey.<br/><br/>Cheerful about seeing a smile back on Lenore's face whilst also doing his best to doge Kim's attempts at ""reuniteing"" both of them,Mills begins to fear that the holiday will turn out to be far from relaxing,when he begins to notice gangs circling in on his family,who seem to have a connection to people that attempted to kidnap his daughter.<br/><br/>View on the film:<br/><br/>Keeping away from the route that I had originally expected them to take,of creating a stand alone follow-up,the screenplay by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen cleverly connect the two parts together by showing the faces of the families from the ""nameless thugs"" that Mills had to kill in the first one in order to save his daughter, which leads to the villains all having a purpose and a real meaning to the story.<br/><br/>Along with giving the baddies a background motive,Besson and Kamen move away from the man on a mission outline of the first one,to instead make it a family affair,which despite leading to some rather silly moments, (the best way to locate someone?,throw a grenade!) does leads to Mills quest to save his family feeling much more motivated and stronger than it was in the first one.<br/><br/>Replacing part one's director Pierre Morel,director Oliver Megaton (what a last name!),gives the stunning Istanbul location a dusty,pastel like appearance which leads to the scenes where each of the family members are struggling to locate an important building,to look as if the buildings are some sort of mirage.Disapointingly,despite the budget being 20 million more than the first one,Megaton sadly lacks the clear sheen that Pierre Morel displayed which helped to make each of the action scenes so thrilling,with Megaton instead taking a ""chopy"" approach to the action scenes,which leads to them feeling oddly weak due to him not allowing the camera to pull back and get a full picture of the action going on.<br/><br/>Along with Liam Nesson giving a wonderful,gruff performance,Famke Janssen gives a terrific performance that is a huge improvement on her rather 2 dimensional one in the first one,with Janssen showing real warmth in her scenes between Kim and Bryan,and also showing Lenore trying to stay when fear strikes,as Lenore reveals that she will not be ""taken"" for granted."

","I really like ""Taken"", I have seen it several times. But ""Taken 2"" is a bit of a disappointment for me. For one, it re-hashes in a sort of way everything Mills does in the first movie, using his superior training and experience to find the unfindable and to defeat any number of antagonists. And second, perhaps I am over-thinking this, but if his daughter already had been kidnapped in a foreign country, wouldn't he be more wary of taking her and mom to another foreign country, and take extra pains to assure their safety?<br/><br/>Anyway, Liam Neeson is back as Bryan Mills, his daughter has not yet passed her driving test, and that is an issue.

If you just want to see Liam Neeson and fights and explosions... well, happy day.<br/><br/>My overriding feel is that this is like a steak pulled off the grill long before it was done. There's the germ of a good movie here. Some clever, creative writer should have spent a lot more time developing it; some clever director should have realized it; and some capable stunt-coordinator should have had a capable camera-man capture it.<br/><br/>Instead, we get the half-baked, bloody undone thing served up on a shaky, cracked plate.<br/><br/>Where to start? Let's take continuity and character-growth. I mean, seriously: what does a guy have to do to get a ""Trust Me, I Know What I'm Doing"" card? Didn't the wife and daughter even *see* the first movie? Evidently not, because they're still disrespecting Neesons's character, deceiving him, shutting him out, and demanding that he submit everything with an explanation in triplicate. That's quickly obnoxious and boring.<br/><br/>And then, yeah, dimwit Maggie Grace can go around tossing grenades and no one notices. Good to know about Turkey. I'm sure they appreciate that image.<br/><br/>But you know, the premise that ""All these people you killed in the first movie had relatives, and they're ticked"" is totally workable, and a good set up. But it just doesn't go anywhere. The Godfather character is picturesque, but hollow. And all the guys who get killed in this movie are just as colorless as -- more than! -- the guys they're supposedly avenging.<br/><br/>And then it's just kind of funny: for the whole movie, most of them are just canon fodder for Liam Neeson to kill -- until the last henchman. Suddenly there's ONE GUY who's got the stuff to equal Neeson...even though he's a pudgy, relatively older guy!<br/><br/>Who is this one man who alone is the equal of Neeson's killing machine? Have we even seen him before, among all the other nameless, sweaty, unshaven Middle Eastern types? Why is he the only capable one in the organization? Where did he get the skills that enable him to come an atom away from killing Neeson, which dozens of others COMBINED failed to do? Is there an interesting story there, a compelling character, someone with a story to rival Neeson's?<br/><br/>We don't know. He exists only to provide a climax. I mean, it's a good scene, what I could see of it... but it had no real emotional resonance. Because unless I missed something, he just appeared from the shadowy figures at the wall, Swarthy Thug #47. A good writer could have set us up for some real tension. Too bad there wasn't one in sight.<br/><br/>And back to that ""what I could see of it"": good heavens. Really? Shaky- camera-as-substitute-for-well-done-action-choreography in a high-budget picture?

In many ways it feels like a classic espionage thriller as it has the same kind of twitchy atmosphere and exotic setting – in this case, Istanbul.<br/><br/>Neeson returns as the past-it CIA man who decides to take his estranged wife and daughter on holiday to Europe, only to fall foul of some sinister Albanians who want revenge for his actions in the original flick.

The script is derivative and there are plenty of stupid moments (like those involving grenade tossing), but when a film has drive and vivacity like this, it doesn't really matter.<br/><br/>Despite the film's entertainment value, it's impossible to ignore the various faults, including a lousier director than before (Olivier Megaton, who also messed up TRANSPORTER 3) and more emphasis on the irritating characters, namely Maggie Grace.

Kim's mother Lenore (Famke Janssen) is having relationship problems with her husband, and they surprise Bryan who is taking a vacation in Istanbul, Turkey following an assignment for the CIA, and the daughter lets her parents go out while she stays in the hotel to go swimming in the pool. They are unaware that they are being followed by Murad's men, but Bryan suspects this when he notices a car behind them trailing, and after trying to get away they catch Lenore while the men force him to surrender. Before giving himself he calls Kim to warn him that her mother and he will be taken, and he warns her that she will be next, so he instructs her to hide, she is near being caught, but she manages to escape, and then the phone cuts when he is captured. Bryan wakes up with his hands tied to a pole, but he manages to use a secret communication device, he urges her to go to the U.S Embassy to tell the situation, but she begs him for a chance to help them having grown up and knowing the situation they are in, so he guides her how to help them. She opens his case of weaponry, taking some grenades and a gun, throwing a live grenade out the window he calculates from the sound of the explosion how far away she is from the stronghold as she looks on a map marking it down, and he promises to call her back while she travels to the marked spot. After Murad comes in the room for a quick vicious encounter, Kim has reached the spot on the map and gone to the rooftops, Bryan manages to break his restraints and instructs her to throw another couple of grenades to determine the building location, and she finds it via the steam chimney, and she throws his gun down the chute for him to shoot the thugs and escape. He and Kim get away from the criminals, who are behind them shooting, but they return to try and save Lenore, but she has already been moved, and chased away again the criminals following are killed, and they crash into the U.S. Embassy, and he calls his friend to stop the guards from shooting them. With Kim safe Bryan goes to the new compound, having memorised sounds and locations while being taken with her, and he shoots the various thugs in his path to reach Murad, he insists that if he is killed his sons and other gang members will be after him. Murad does agree to let him and his family go and never be bothered again, but of course he is lying and grabs the gun dropped, only to see that Bryan has removed the bullets, and knowing he wouldn't really agree to a truce he pushes the criminal to the wall into a blunt pipe to die, and he can save Lenore. Three weeks later the Mills family are all safe and sound and eating ice cream in a café to celebrate Kim passing her perfect driving test, they are joined also by her boyfriend Jamie (Luke Grimes), she jokes to her father Bryan not to shoot or restrain him, and they settle. Also starring Leland Orser as Sam, Jon Gries as Casey and Dinosaur's D.B. Sweeney as Bernie. Neeson still proves himself as the determined and skilled secret agent father who will do anything to keep his family safe and stop the bad guys, I agree the film is a little similar in some of its content, but when the film has just as much good violence, deadly ways to kill the villains and good pace it doesn't matter, a fun action drama. Good!"

","If I were Albanian, I would be thinking of organising some sort of boycott for the way my people are portrayed in this sequel to the well-made 2008 hit. Not because the movie portrays Albanians as criminals, but as bad criminals. Honestly, is this the best the casting director and scriptwriter could come up with? No scary dialogue, no scary people. Just thugs with AKs and Glocks. Okay, that's scary, but basically it's surprising they don't all shoot themselves in the foot. The chief baddie out for revenge because his son was killed in Paris just looks like a tired old man with a bad haircut. He spends must of his time sitting in an empty room. Inexplicably, he suffers from the Blofeld syndrome: once Neeson and his ex are captured, he talks too much while setting up the usual ""horrendous death"" scenario and actually leaves the room, allowing Neeson time to escape, coordinate his daughter's rescue, and contemplate lots of scenery. His henchmen look like gorillas in track suits. This is supposed to be the cream of the dreaded Albanian mafia? And the Turks, who are wary of Kurds so are no slouches when it comes to police work, look incompetent, corrupt and stuck with old, modified Ladas as police cars. Usually, it's a bad script that's the problem in a bad movie – and Lord knows this one is no Oscar contender – but here the problem is really casting. Not only are the crooks bad, the daughter (Maggie Grace) looks like she's aged 20 years since the last film. She's supposed to be about 18 or 19, in reality the actress is 29, and she looks like 39, or maybe 29 with too much partying. Back home, she can hardly drive in an empty parking lot with an automatic, having failed her driving test twice. In Istanbul, she steals a stick shift and can suddenly outclass a Finnish rally car champion – in Istanbul, mind you. How? Liam is in fine form and has improved his horribly fake American accent slightly (which was I think the basis for a Robot Chicken sketch), but even he looks a little long in the tooth for the action sequences, or maybe he's just a bit bored playing a role that he can do in his sleep, where he's not even called on to be outraged. The beautiful mommy and ex-wife Famke Janssen doesn't have much to do except suffer; there's some sort of inexplicable deus ex machine subplot with hubby number 2 leaving her as a prelude to cancelling a reconciliation attempt that was supposed to be a vacation, all as an elaborate scheme to explain how the mommy and daughter meet Liam in Istanbul where the Albanians track them down and get to work. In brief, none of the believable bad buys and outraged father of the original – Neeson is sleepwalking, despite the high octane action sequences, Janssen is mostly unconscious, and daughter Grace transforms from alienated mall girl to 007 as soon as she gets her hands on a grenade, which daddy Liam conveniently carries around. Any positives in this mess? Well, obviously these movies are well made in a technical sense, if you don't expect any sort of character-driven plot (there isn't any, not a shred, except the old Albanian's desire for revenge). The action sequences are fine. That's it. Sappy script, wooden acting, bad casting. Watchable, but barely."

","This is one of the most preposterously bad films that I've seen recently, primarily because the plot lines make absolutely zero sense. And this is coming from a guy who loved the first film Taken, is utterly impressed by Luc Besson's films La Femme Nikita and The Professional, and likes the acting of Liam Neeson, Famke Janssen, and Maggie Grace. What a complete waste of talent to put them in this film! And a complete waste of my money and time! <br/><br/>***SPOILERS BELOW*** <br/><br/>I'm being charitable when I say it utterly begs credulity to believe that the daughter, who can't even pass a driver's license test in California, can suddenly drive and maneuver like a pro through the narrow crowded streets of Istanbul while being shot at by any number of bad guys with machine guns, and being chased by innumerable police cars. I've rarely seen such a remarkably poor plot line. I mean, really, it's degrading to the audience to have to view such nonsensical garbage.<br/><br/>Plus, does it make any sense at all that Liam Neeson's character is going to ask his DAUGHTER TO THROW GRENADES FROM ROOFS so he can geo-locate where he has been kidnapped to? How utterly preposterous is that? Sure, daughter, go ahead and pull the pin from the grenade and count to THREE, and then throw it as far as you can! And by the way, with each step on the rooftops, you're moving closer to the bad guys with machine guns instead of towards the safety of the U.S. Embassy! It would be hilarious if it weren't so painfully bad.<br/><br/>If Neeson can call his best bud in the CIA, then can't he leave him an SOS message to bring in the cavalry so to speak? Surely there'd be agents on station in Istanbul who could provide fast response? Surely they'd be more qualified than his daughter to combat/track down the bad guys? <br/><br/>A minor point - the film would have felt more authentic if the bad guys actually spoke Albanian to each other.<br/><br/>I felt the premise of the Albanians seeking revenge in Istanbul had promise, but it all went downhill from there into a deep black yawning abyss of terribleness. Do not *ever* see this film. What a travesty.<br/><br/>Rick"

","I don't mean to be gushy but I absolutely loved the first Taken, not exactly the case with its sequel though. Taken 2 is definitely a good watch and I do recommend it. However, it's not nearly as powerful as the first one.<br/><br/>Taken 2 follows the same structure of the former. Megaton does a great job in directing the film, as he maintains the story fast paced, making it dynamic and enjoyable. Suspense is also used in an intelligent way, which adds to the audience's surprise in positive lights. In this sense, the film gives what its genre promises, action and thrill. I'm not impressed because it's an average action film, and it had the potential to be mind blowing as the first one was. <br/><br/>Taken 2 is not as unpredictable as the first is, there are not enough twists in the plot, it's not as thrilling as it's promoted to be. That is the case in many other sequels, they don't live up to the high standards the first films usually set.<br/><br/>Neeson's acting is flawless as usual, but in my opinion Taken 2 could have given him a much better material to work with."

","Following the events of the first film, Brian Mills (Liam Neeson) is in Istanbul, Turkey with his ex-wife (Famke Jansenn) and daughter (Maggie Grace) when the vengeful father (Rade Sherbedjia) of one of Mills' victims from the first film arrives with a group of armed men to ""take"" them all. Hilarity ensues. <br/><br/>Pass the popcorn and drink your soda, ""Taken 2"" is as clumsy and ploddy as the first was intelligent and fresh. This summer sequel was made to give people an excuse to sit in an air-conditioned room to get their bodies and minds out of the heat. Friends of mine that enjoyed it saw it when they were wearing shorts. Perhaps the fact that I watched it in the winter made me enjoy it less. <br/><br/>Neeson is as good as he always is, returning to his mystical role as a fatherly badass perpetually ready to dole out some deserved punishment to whoever is unlucky enough to want to do him harm. But his eyes are a little more dim, his movements a little less tense. It's the little things that convey to the audience that his heart just isn't in this one.<br/><br/>Famke Jansenn and Maggie Grace, both stunningly beautiful women, hold this guy viewer's attention about as much as Neeson. They play the women in this man's lives with as much bravado as they can manage in their mostly listless lines. Rade Sherbedjia, the usual stock Eastern-European baddie, definitely chews the most scenery in a very good performance.<br/><br/>Having been to Turkey and Istanbul a couple of times, I can say without any doubt that the nation seen in this movie is markedly different than the real one. The Turkish people are wonderfully kind and the country is as beautiful as anything in Europe. If you're seeing this film because you've seen the real thing, be ready for as much disappointment as bummer.<br/><br/>I didn't have too much fun writing this. I would have had more fun watching ""Taken 2"" again. Perhaps that is as good as an analogy as I can think of to both end this review and offer my warning."

","If I had not seen the first, 'Taken', I would have been completely satisfied with, 'Taken 2'. Alas, I did see the first in this series and was looking for more of the same. For example: In the first installment, the Neeson character would use a weapon a couple of seconds, drop it and immediately scarf up some new inanimate object and employ its lethality. Another example: The intense spontaneity – you just knew he would stop at nothing to get his daughter back. I can't say the second movie was bad, I mean it was a pretty good shoot 'em up. The cast was brilliant but the script seemed to be poorly manufactured or rushed. Their also seemed to be social filters added that should not even be considered as far as abductions go. Turning a blind eye might be good for the government and law officialsbut for a mom or a dadsorry – everything's game. Kind of like the first movie – you want answers – shoot the bad guys wife in the arm, then you'll answers. I mean for children's sake, that actually sounds pretty mild to me. Do I think there is room for a 'Taken 3' – sure. I think I would concentrate on his elite group and maybe getting one of his team out of trouble. Anyways – I will give this movie a few stars because I liked the action and the castbut I cannot give it a 10."

","I missed this at the cinema, but didn't feel too bad about it as I heard it was just an awful cash-in. Regardless, I awaited the DVD.<br/><br/>I have to say I enjoyed this film, but I feel for those who paid around the £15 mark including popcorn, etc to see it at the cinema. However, I've rated it 5/10 simply because of the superb action only. Without that it would probably be a 3 I'm afraid.<br/><br/>The first half hour was very good and setting up for a great action ride. A few little quirks here and there, but I passed these off as Bryan (Liam Neeson) is clearly very good at 'what he does best'.<br/><br/>The last hour of the movie; whilst good, to me it was entirely unbelievable for a number of reasons. I won't divulge too many details as this is a review, but the last hour could have almost been in real time. He manages to contrive his escape, save both his wife and daughter independently and kill all and sundry in an hour. We've all seen this before in 24, but I was expecting better for the sequel of a great movie.<br/><br/>I know, I know, sequels are invariably worse than their predecessors. But I live in hope! My recommendation: Watch the first 30 minutes, then read this (warning, this DOES contain spoilers)...<br/><br/>Bryan wakes up and calls his daughter. He gives her instructions on how to find him 4.5km away. She's there in 10 minutes and Bryan escapes. He gets to the roof to save Kim before she is killed, but is unable to save his wife from being taken away in a black van. So he takes Kim to a safe place, then returns for a good portion of gunfire and a nice fisticuffs, kills their leader and returns home with all his family intact."

And rightfully so, despite its flimsy sub-textual message about how unsafe the world is. Mainly due to the innovative Macchiavellan main character, who sets his goals and tanks his way to reach them. Despite not necessarily typecast Liam Neeson excels in this role, strong and ruthless, thus surprisingly becoming an action star at old age. ""Taken 2"" basically rehashes the original, albeit basing it on an even more ridiculous plot, essentially set in typical Luc Besson style 'better not ask' realm of the illogical. Nonetheless Besson never fails at one thing: in supplying over-the-top intense action scenarios. Despite the second part too closely replicating the original and some flimsy directing the overall action is basically just as appealing, thus thrusting us to relive the experience in a new location and some alternate scenarios. Basically delivered more of the same as an obvious attempt to milk the cow, its sure to satisfy ""Taken"" crazies, but won't go much further then there, as the story fails to build on the characters and expand into new directions. Once again the villains take a back seat (somewhat a shame as Serbedzija is severely underused as a potential great baddie), whilst Neeson dispatches and delivers his two damsels from distress."

","Retired CIA agent, Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) and Lenore ( Famke Janssen) his ex-wife and daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) are on vacation in Istanbul when he and Lenore are kidnapped by the father of one of the men Bryan killed and who was one of the men who kidnapped Bryan's daughter Kim (in the first TAKEN movie). See? <br/><br/>We are told that nothing succeeds like success and here we are shown a new twist on a previous movie. One asks, can Kim act like a Mel Gibson character and get her parents back? Only kidding. Well, I thought I was kidding, but Bryan has Kim doing things to pinpoint where the kidnappers are keeping him and Lenore. Kind of clever. Have no idea if all that would work in real life, but hey, this is a movie and anything is possible. Still clever though.<br/><br/>The movie kind of starts out with Bryan giving Kim driving lessons to get her driver license (she failed twice before); but as you will see later Kim, with her unlicensed driving skills, destroys all the Turkish police cars chasing them. The car chasing stunts are truly spectacular and I had to dodge a few fenders myself and yes, some were pretty close. But, I am getting ahead of myself. Sorry. <br/><br/>There is plenty of excitement throughout because we know that Bryan will do exactly what he says about himself: ""what I do best."" And, to be sure, he doesn't disappoint. The entire cast performed well, even the bad guys.<br/><br/>Now, is this movie as good as the original TAKEN? I would say they are on a par with each other and that's pretty good.<br/><br/>However, there is a picky point I must share. When Bryan is kidnapped we see him in a car going over a river on a ferry. When he escapes (come on, you know he will), we are not shown him going back over that river. In fact when Kim does what Bryan tells her what to do from her hotel location we see that he is close and no river is in sight. It was like he was just around the corner. See? Other than that, I see this as good thriller and very entertaining. <br/><br/>Ah, I see you have a question: did Kim finally pass her driving test? Hmmmmm (7/10)<br/><br/>Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No. Only one s-word was heard."

","I saw Taken when it came out in 2008 and I thought it was very, very well made and acted. The same CANNOT be said about Taken 2. This movie is absolutely terrible. i could criticize almost every aspect of the movie but I wouldn't want to bore the masses. Let me ""lowlight"" some of the unintentional hilarity of this drama. first and foremost, newly estranged ex-wife Famke Jannsen who was a total jerk to Liam is now sad but flirty to Liam - it does not come across as believable at all. Liam is still watching his daughter like a hawk (kind of creepy actually) and shows up at her boyfriends door unannounced and refuses to acknowledge the boyfriend at all - even when he introduces himself. The daughter can't pass her DMV exam ( 2 failures) yet in Istanbul she drives a taxi better than the keystone Turkish cops chasing -in old 70's junkers no less! Since when do woman in Turkey wear Burkas? This movie does all i can to make Istanbul look like a slum - it's outrageous and wrong. There is nothing credible about the plot. When Liam and now amorous ex Famke get chased by Albanians who seem to speak a lot of English, Liam gives her verbal instructions in a seedy area that are so ridiculous - you would think he had grown up in that exact neighborhood. Laughable. The worst part of this stinker is when the now intrepid and fearless daughter - the same one who couldn't pass her DMV test, is walking on thin ledges on buildings, jumping roof tops and - are you ready - throwing hand grenades all over Istanbul in the most far fetched belief that hostage superman Liam will hear the explosion and guide super-daughter to his dungeon. Suspending all realms of belief - it works!! With dads ""McGyver"" super agent cell phone he had hidden on him he's been in perfectly clear reception and she is guided to the old steam pipe on the roof and drops a gun down the pipe which lands perfectly at dads feet. Did you get that? This movie puts 007 to shame, making James Bond look very, very pedestrian. Of course the thugs are menacing at first, then descend into a bunch of idiots then transform into machine gun toting morons who cant Liam if he was standing still. Crashing a stolen taxi thru ( literally ) the gates of the US Embassy - with every guard firing machine guns is no big deal for Liam and daughter. One call to his spy buddy in the states and it's back to mayhem on the Bosphorus!! The predicable ending indicates there may be a Taken 3 made. The movie begins and ends in California and has one of the sappiest soundtracks I've ever heard. TERRIBLE."

","Call me a crazy nut job, but I expected so much better. I very much liked the first Taken but this really was a joke.<br/><br/>I think Neeson knew this film had gone pear shaped and probably gave up because you kind of sense it in some of the scenes and to be honest his acting in this was well below his usual high standard. I don't blame him at all really, and to his credit its only his his presence which sort of holds the entire thing together. The majority of blame for this joke factory (not that its funny in any way) should be laid at the directors feet. A truly awful job by Olivier Megaton - there is nothing mega about this guys effort.<br/><br/>On paper, the premise of the film seems fine - although rather predictable. But its surely the directors job to pour some soul and magic in to the mix and create something worthy. But he failed miserably and the result is a shameful film executed with zero pace, tension, style, or anything remotely resembling a pro job. Some blame also has to go to the script writing. Now, I don't know if Luc Besson actually wrote the script spoken by the cast, but if he did its a terrible effort from him. But then again, even with a very average script a good director could have made a half decent movie of this genre - especially considering he had the original Taken to reference and Liam Neeson to work with. <br/><br/>A golden opportunity has been missed here. Liams likable character had so much to offer in terms of development, but you get none of that at all. In fact his character is completely watered down. In the first instalment he reminded me as a cross between leon and James Bond but in Taken 2 he's just some bloke running around with a gun taking out the bad guys without breaking a sweat. At no time do you actually feel Liam or his family are in any real danger. Its like watching a kid playing an X box shoot em up game on very easy mode.<br/><br/>The question I ask my self is didn't anyone notice how bad the script, the directing or any other multitude of film making sins whilst this thing was being created? Was it to late during the early stages to make script changes, even re-do some of the plot - or better yet, sack Megaton? Didn't anyone speak up? Megaton, didn't you notice how crap a job you were doing as you played back the days filming results. Did you not notice you couldn't coax a decent performance out of any of the actors. Did you not notice you have zero ability to inspire cast or crew? Don't mean to be rude Megaton, but if you aim to make more films you seriously need to up your game (massively) or change your career.<br/><br/>Im not a massive film buff or know anything about the ins and outs of film making. There are far more knowledgeable people on IMDb who know the score. But what I do know is this film is crap, and even I could have directed this about a billion times better than this guy - despite never having directed a film in my life. I really should get my self on a plane to Hollywood as it seems anyone can get a directing job."

The suspense factor were missing, no original ideas. you feel like, they are depending on the success of the previous movie, and trying to get as much money as they can get. very poor choice of music and soundtracks, like they haven't put much effort into it. The trick scene, the scene when he told his daughter how to find them, was the most clever and interesting scene in the whole movie. at the end, it was O.K, emotionless, without a deep meaning, cliché, a rip off from the previous movie and you have a feeling they didn't an effort into it anyway."

","Bryan Mills' life seems to have taken an upswing after the events that unfolded in the 2008 hit 'Taken'. He has a better relationship with his ex-wife and daughter, his career seems to be picking up better, and he seems happier than he seemed in the beginning of Taken. However, the relatives of the villains he took out in France plans to take revenge. This plan comes to fruition once Bryan brings his family to Istanbul for a vacation. Bryan and his wife are kidnapped, and he has to instruct his daughter to locate him using improvised plans and improbable mental calculations.<br/><br/>When I first heard that the movie was around Bryan talking his daughter through to tracking him down, I was disappointed. Taken was a highly improbable, but thoroughly gripping movie about Bryan's shoot-up- everyone-and-follow-the-body-trail-to-his-daughter strategy of investigation, and Liam Neeson is able to portray the hidden bad-ass like few others. But pushing the action to the daughter just took my interest down by several notches. Also, the reviews I got from friends were very negative. But I have to say that I enjoyed the movie well enough. It didn't have the pace or grip of the original movie, but it does decently well on its own. It's not a brilliant movie, but it doesn't qualify as a bad movie. It's worth a watch. (Hey. not making sense doesn't make it a bad movie, does it?)<br/><br/>One nitpick - The first poster I saw for 'Taken 2' had the tag-line ""They want revenge. They chose the wrong guy"". No, if they want revenge, they definitely chose the right guy. They can't call for revenge against Bryan Mills and choose someone else to target. But I think that would be a decent premise. You know, some group of radicals are taking up revenge against a common man for... I don't know, something petty like cutting the villain off at an intersection. The villains mix it up and accidentally targets Bryan Mills for revenge. Of course, among rapidly piling bodies, they find out too late that they bit off more than they could chew. They can call it ""Taken 3: MisTaken"". Hollywood - consider that one a gift."
"vriesspeech","5","0","0","6 January 2013"," The most redundant film in years
","I really enjoyed the original Taken. I thought it was a dark, gritty revenge flick with a decent plot and a great role by Liam Neeson. In fact, it felt like the movie was written for him, the character of Bryan Mills fit him like a glove. In a former life a successful spy with very specific skill set that made him a killing machine. He swore off that life to become a loving father to his estranged daughter, but he is forced to pick up his weapons one more time when his daughter is taken by East-European criminals who sell girls to brothels. The film ended on a high note and has some rememberable action scenes. The sequel however, is probably the most redundant film of the last years. <br/><br/>In Taken 2, the family of the gangsters from the first film are out for blood and kidnap Mills, along with his ex-wife Lennie (Famke Janssen) and daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) while they are on their vacation in Istanbul. Mills and his daughter manage to escape and focus their efforts on freeing Lennie. The plot is essentially the same as the first film. It feels like Luc Besson was forced to write a script that could be turned into a sequel machine, while being held at gunpoint by the movie studio. Taken 2 has practically no memorable scenes, like the famous telephone monologue in the first film. The movie is even funny at times (probably unintentionally so), especially when grenades are being thrown around like candy in the center of Istanbul, because that's clearly the best way to find out where someone is located. <br/><br/>The film also feels dumbed-down when compared to the original. Some of the scenes in the original Taken were gruesome and shocking, but the violence in the sequel is clearly lessened in order to appeal to a wider audience. The villains never feel like a real threat. Mills always manages to place his shots perfectly, while the bad guys mainly seem occupied with filling walls and cars with their bullets. In some way, Taken 2 hurts the hero's character, because the villains feel so incompetent that it makes the viewer doubt Mill's actual abilities. While the action is often pleasing to watch, you never feel like Mills stands against a real threat. <br/><br/>Taken 2 feels like a re-hash of the last film and it nowhere manages to trump its predecessor. The action is decently shot, but often very blandly directed. The ferocity that characterized Neeson in the first film is nowhere to be found in Taken 2. In fact, it just feels like he's along for the ride the entire time, waiting for the shooting to stop and collect his pay check. Director Olivier Megaton (insert funny remark about his last name here) is clearly banking on the success of the previous film and plays it safe all the way through. Taken 2 has decent action scenes and doesn't outstay its welcome, but it never manages to even level with the first film. The movie feels like a simple cash grab by the studio. Recommended for anyone who's is looking for a somewhat acceptable action movie to watch with friends, where little to no brain activity is required."

","I was kind of looking forward to this. I thoroughly enjoyed the first Taken movie and hoped for a repeat of the action and tension in this film. Sadly, it was not to be.<br/><br/>There are a number of problems with the film, not the least of which is that it isn't really tense at all. Not in the slightest. There is action and shooting and fighting, but none of it has any real bite to it at all.<br/><br/>Next there are the ridiculous plot devices that mar the movie. Barricades in front of an embassy are not set so that you can drive straight between them. Istanbul is painted as a 'Mos Eisley' style den of lawlessness where you can shoot guns and set off grenades without repercussions.<br/><br/>My favvorite, though, is the physics abuse moment. Most films have them, but this one is a classic. In it, Neeson's character has his daughter set off a grenade whilst he is talking to her on a mobile phone. He hears the explosion on the phone, then starts counting until he hears the blast normally. He counts to just under four seconds which, in his infinite (but badly incorrect) judgement, he tells his daughter is four and a half kilometres. I'm sorry, but the speed of sound in air is approx. 340 metres per second, not over 1,000 m/s! It's nonsense like the above that make the movie into a mindless action-fest and not the clever film that its predecessor was. That, plus the lack of menace in any of the villains, really make the film fall flat on its face.<br/><br/>SUMMARY: Dull and repetitive, dumb plot devices and awful science, incompetent villains who aren't scary. Dialled in performances from Neeson and Jansen. A recipe for a movie you'll watch once and then never, ever watch again."

","After reading reviews on here I must say I was expecting this movie to be quite awful, but to be honest I actually really enjoyed it! Sure it wasn't the epic blockbuster the first movie was but the majority of sequels aren't quite AS great as the original..<br/><br/>For me, the plot worked; it was your typical revenge movie and the guys wanting revenge are obviously the kind of people you don't want to mess with in the first place. The setting (Turkey) was perfect for this kind of movie, the scenery and settings are great and it probably is, to more of an extent than other countries in Europe, the kind of place you could get away with this kind of mayhem for a certain period of time.<br/><br/>As for things like the daughters driving, which many people seem to have qualms about; she is the daughter of an ex spook who was obviously very good at his job (as we found out quite rightly in 'Taken') and people do tend to perform better when placed under great deals of stress. So why is it that hard to come to grips with a scene like that in a movie such as this!?<br/><br/>Go into this expecting a revenge type follow up to the original movie and I'm sure you'll enjoy your 90 minutes worth of entertainment, it is a movie after all, and it definitely entertains!"

","The first ""Taken"" was a cool quasi video game style movie with some good fight scenes. As ridiculous as it was, it didn't get to the point where it got ludicrous or very dumb. Sequels that fix the flaws of the first one is usually a good sequel. This one it adds to the flaws constantly to the point I couldn't help but laugh at how dumb this movie is. Yeah, sometimes movies go in a direction where you just have to just go with it. But because of the atmosphere of this flick it makes everything appalling. This review would get very long if I narrowed down every ridiculous scene in this movie. But one of them is when the bad guys lock Liam Neeson's character up and tie him to a bar. Now he is a guy that taken out plenty of the bad guy's men. But no one keeps a watch on him, this isn't ""Austin Powers"". Even ""Austin Powers"" makes a joke about those kinda scenarios. Sure if the movie gave the protagonist few rooms to maneuver around in, it would have been possible. But the way this movie goes is like the bad guy's blindfold themselves and ask Liam Neeson's character to escape and kill them, like a death wish or something. Watching this was like seeing ""Grand Theft Auto"" which doesn't work for a movie like this. I mean Liam's character and his daughter who is too old to still play that perky teenage girl. Goes around breaking every law in Istanbul. Some of the hand to hand fight sequences are cool to watch and it has it's moments especially near the end. But that isn't enough to make this movie any good. It's watchable and that is all.<br/><br/>5.9/10"

First thing I noticed was how they tried to make Bryan Mills way too much like Bryan Mills. In Taken, we all noticed how disciplined and strong minded this man was. In this movie, they were just trying to exaggerate this way too much. And Bryan Mills would never let his daughter get into the middle of the fight while she could've gone to the American Embassy and gotten real help. The Albanians were just completely pointless. Their reason to kill Bryan Mills was pretty pointless too. I mean especially after knowing how capable he is and all that. He had to go through much tougher forces in the first movie than the ones faced here and yet he won. SO WHY WOULD THEY EVEN BOTHER? After all, in the first movie, the Albanians got killed because of what they were doing. AND GRENADES JUST THROW AROUND RANDOMLY LIKE THAT? WHAT? And also, at the hotel, when Bryan's daughter went down to the maids' locker room and stole some clothes, the maid there started screaming ""Theif"" or something like that. Why the hell would a maid bother about a thief when there was a shooting inside the hotel and it was in full alert mode? And lets not even get started on how Bryan Mills and his daughter rammed through an American barricade, WHILE they were being shot at by several 50 caliber machine guns which can even handle a couple of T-Rexes, with a 20 year old Merc taxi.<br/><br/>All I'm saying is, I've rarely been this disappointed by a sequel.

","Being a huge fan of the first Taken film I wasn't at all put off by the negative reviews I read especially when they said things like 'too much like the original' - 'same film' etc. If anything this made me want to see it more! I mean the first film was awesome – I would happily sit through that again. Ass kicking, bad acting and 80's action catchphrases – I'm in for a treat.<br/><br/>So I went into the film without checking the rating – I mean to me it was obvious Taken 2 would be a 15 right? Wrong. The dreaded 12A flashed up on the screen – I immediately cringed. Surely this must be a mistake. It wasn't.<br/><br/>I sat through an hour and a half of soft core action. Taken (I like to call Liam Neeson 'Taken') would dispatch his enemies as you would expect – however to keep in lines with the oppressive rule of 12A you couldn't see exactly how they met their demise – there was a lot of funny camera angles, close ups and loud noises (not the cool bone breaking noises like in the first – but soft core grunting and loud crashing) - next thing the baddie would be lying dead on the ground. How did that happen? I thought to myself. <br/><br/>So it came to the scene of the final fight - between Taken and the bad guy who can actually fight back (like the not so menacing skinny bad guy with long curly hair and bad facial hair in the first – badly casted in both films I would say)- I really hoped that the film would redeem itself and have a good fight scene. But no – more close ups and shaky camera angles, Taken struggling a bit and next thing the bad guy was dead. I could have walked out I say. I didn't though<br/><br/>I can honestly not remember the last time I left a film feeling so angry at the director for making it into a 12A – maybe Terminator 4.<br/><br/>Everything that made Taken so awesome i.e. the bone crunching and brutal butt kicking action (that you could actually see) mixed with epic dialogue and an annoying girl who seems to be running in every scene was 'taken' away in this film. Actually she did still run quite a bit<br/><br/>Anyways I'm rabbiting on now so to sum up my review – a family fun, fast paced, soft core action film that may be enjoyable had you not enjoyed the wonders of the first one. <br/><br/>To all you Taken fans out there that haven't seen this yet please don't – it will upset you deeply."

","It has become painfully clear that the powers that be, i.e. the money behind movies, have gained entirely too much control over the creative process, otherwise how can we explain the constant stream of prequels and sequels which have of late occupied the big screen over the past few years? I get tired of repeating this constant theme...I truly sound like a broken record with this!<br/><br/>A few years ago when I saw the original ""Taken"", I left the theatre thoroughly satisfied by the experience I had watching Liam Neeson kick ass and take no prisoners, in what was a cool, hip and to my mind, old fashioned thriller which reminded me of movies like ""Bullit"", the Dirty Harry movies, and the ""Death Wish"" franchise. Besides, it didn't have CGI effects or any other distracting bells and whistles! It made a strong case for revenge, and though it is not in my nature to enjoy revenge or encourage it as a course of action, I found myself cheering alongside my fellow audience members as we watched Neeson dispatch the baddies with such ruthless efficiency. After all how could I not, watching a father exact vengeance upon those who hurt his daughter! Seeing him dismantle a ring of human smugglers, was pure awesomeness!!! The movie ended on a perfect note! The necessity of a sequel was at least to my mind mercifully excluded.<br/><br/>Cue a few years later and an itch to squeeze a few more bucks out of a movie which should have been left alone...and voilà we have ""Taken 2"", another thoroughly unnecessary sequel. Thankfully just as other reviewers have already pointed out, the movie is not nearly as bad as it could have been. Neeson remains in form and is still good to see him in action, that is probably because this movie rests on his shoulders. In fact he is the only reason this movie remains even tolerable. Otherwise, ""Taken 2"", is in every way a step down from the first movie. The action is sluggish, the plot is convoluted and oftentimes the entire premise of the movie is preposterous! The script in this case seems to have been an afterthought...kind of tacked on later...it is virtually the same storyline from the first movie (this has to be the unluckiest family ever!), just add the wife, revenge-seeking relatives of the baddies from the first instalment, substitute Paris for Istanbul, and you got yourself a movie! The cast is weak and pretty much window-dressing since they are not given much to do. The storyline is ridiculous and at times it borders on being plain stupid! The acting here is non-existent, while Famke Jansen and Maggie Grace are completely wasted here, except being relegated to filling up the required spaces of a fragile accessory and an annoying side-kick.<br/><br/>As I said before, ""Taken 2"" is not as bad as I thought it would be, but I cannot recommend it as a must-see or anything of the kind. Don't waste your money on this one...<br/><br/>PS As a side note, this movie does not paint a very positive portrait of Albanians...also, apparently all bad guys nowadays come from the same place...Trebuje!"

","As a Turkish citizen i'm tired of seeing Istanbul as an ancient ruined Muslim city in the movies of western directors. While Istanbul is larger than most of many countries and has a population of 15 million, still we're exposed to scenes covering only a few kilometer squares of the city, namely the historical peninsula. It is also the case in Taken 2 as well.<br/><br/>It's still interesting to see how inaccurate people can be even though they're supposed to be professionals and they're shooting the movie in a very small zone. While watching the police cars from 70's i wonder whether the crew did not see any police cars while they're spending many days in Istanbul. More importantly, Istanbul is not the capital so there is no US Embassy in the town but US Consulate instead, which is located far away from the movie set. It's not surprising to see women in black scarf in the Historical Peninsula, however one might see lots of women with mini skirts as well. It's more than surprising and not factual though to see some women wearing scarfs who are staring at a woman driver with criticizing eyes. Mosques and everlasting prayers are exhibited as the main characteristics of the city. While the beauty and geographic importance of Bosphorus is emphasized in the film, still the background seems to be deliberately composed of people and streets of an undeveloped Islamic city. I expect to see the same image when i see the latest Bond movie. I hope European or American movie makers manage to walk a few kilometers away from the Grand Bazaar or Blue Mosque to see the undiscovered % 99 percent of Istanbul one day."

","OK, first of all, the tacked on glurgey happy families subplot bugged me. I just don't believe the ex wives of international security specialist hard men are likely to drop everything and schlepp off to Constantinople with, what one assumes must be, their seriously traumatised, yet surprisingly fashionable and flirty teenage daughters at a moment's notice, no matter their current marital difficulties. I found the nouveau riche mother/ex wife to be thoroughly unlikable, apparently her raison d'etre was to be a weeping liability that Bryan had to keep going back for, when she wasn't being a vehicle to demonstrate the objective badness of the baddies. I get that well to do, sheltered soccer moms probably don't do well when suddenly thrust into the high stakes world of international terrorism, but her entire character arc seemed to go from ""victim"", to ""unconscious victim"".<br/><br/>While Mom the victim was being mindlessly terrorised by the baddies, spunky daughter was able to cope in circumstances that would reduce most combat veterans to tears, yet we're supposed to believe that in the vaguely recent past (i.e. ""Taken"") she was kidnapped, drugged and almost sold into sexual slavery. And no Rocky-esq montage of the years of therapy to get her over her PTSD needed? She's just meant to be fine? Oh, I get it... she has a boyfriend now. Well, I guess that fixes everything.<br/><br/>The sequence of locating the father bugged especially. Ever worked with grenades? They're loud, and dangerous. Loud, obviously, because Bryan can clearly hear them several kilometres away, yet Kim seems to be able to throw several around the roof tops of Constantinople with a. no one taking much notice, b. aside from one car, no observable destructive or injurious effect. While on the subject, someone get that girl a pitching contract! She was throwing grenades, with pin point accuracy, over distances grenade launchers would have difficulty with.<br/><br/>Couple of other things, apparently, like the Eiffel Tower in Paris, the Haiga Sophia is visible from every window in Constantinople, and no matter how many ferries one takes, or how many kilometres of back allies one drives down, its never further away than the middle distance? Did you know that ever motor vehicle in Constantinople with a visible badge is either a BMW or a Mercedes? Even the taxis? Did you know that Albanian crime syndicates use the Turkish national Flag as an identifying tattoo? I guess its easier to draw than the Albanian flag.<br/><br/>I sort of suspect that an ex CIA field officer would know what a Adhan was, and what a muezzin was doing, and not refer to the Muslim call to prayer as a ""man singing"".<br/><br/>Last point, and I know it isn't unique to this movie, but it bugs me that the dateline crawl just says ""Albania"", because thats all the info we need, but back in the good old US of A, we just get ""Los Angeles"". Also, Paris, France, so, you know, we don't think it might be ""Paris, Arkansas"". The way entire countries are given the same weight as single US cities, bugs me, and the way any city worthy of individual naming outside the lower 48 needs to have its country pointed out, bugs me.<br/><br/>All in all, the action was fine, but the niggles ganged up to ruin the story for me, and my suspension of disbelief wasn't strong enough."

If I had been directing this movie I definitely would have casted the non-main roles better because the acting was absolutely crap! This is especially in the fight scenes, they were choreographed really badly and the sounds they put in didn't match up with the scene, I didn't think, either that or the cinema sounds were out of sync which is highly unlikely! Thinking of sounds not matching up with the shots, if you're going to watch the movie, look at the car chase scenes, you can't say that it doesn't work, it looks like they've decided half way throughout editing to put in some of the voice-overs and it just doesn't match up. So, yea, wasn't impressed at all, wouldn't see it again and if I had known I wouldn't have seen it in the first place because it just annoyed me.....<br/><br/>,Becky"

","Really disappointed. <br/><br/>Taken was brilliant, this was a money making exercise, living off the fame of the movie before it.<br/><br/>The start of the movie is horrific. The acting is poor. You don't enjoy the characters. The dad whom is awesome when at work, is pathetic as a parental figure.<br/><br/>There is no decent build up in the movie. It just all seems to happen.<br/><br/>There is one memorable bit in the movie, involving grenades.<br/><br/>The worst thing, it just ends so quickly.<br/><br/>Not worth a cent at the movies.... okay DVD one night."

","The movie itself was actually decent but extremely predictable. The first Taken was awesome but when it comes to the sequel come on now what do you expect to happen? The trailers give away the plot for the whole movie so while Liam is pretty bad ass you know exactly what is coming. Time wise it did feel like I was in there for forever, not like the first one I didn't even notice. Thank god the daughter actually did something this time making up for the first movie. And of course everyone that stands in Liam's way dies. Action was good but sometimes so fast that when the scene is over you sit there like ""what just happened."" Hopefully this will be the last taken they make."

","I was really looking forward to seeing this film for months before it came out & it was nowhere near as good as the first one... it felt predictable, i thought the acting wasn't as good & the storyline was no where near as good as the first one.. This time it didn't seem realistic & was missing the suspense the first film had. I also thought it was very cheesy in places & i couldn't help but laugh more than a few times cos i thought parts were silly. I definitely think they made this film just to get a bit of money again knowing how successful the first movie was. Having read other peoples reviews on what they thought about the movie, I guess i am not alone in thinking this film is a shambles really :( such a shame :("
"rivertam26","6","0","0","19 October 2012"," Unnecessary but fun
","I had no interest in seeing the first Taken I thought it looked pretty generic but when I finally got around to seeing it on DVD I was pleasantly surprised. I thought the film was a blast. Smart, edgy and filled with a kinetic, fiery energy, emotionally engaging and highlighted by a slick, sexy kick ass performance from Liam Neeson in the lead. So when the trailers for Taken 2 first came out I was planning on seeing it even though they were really underwhelming. And than these horrible reviews started flooding in saying it was boring and stupid, nothing like the original and just a cash in on the first film. So I decided to skip it. But today i was feeling kinda off and needed some escapist entertainment so I went. And I'm happy I did. Although it does't hold a candle to the original it mostly works because of the first film. We know these characters and care about them. The film works best in it's smaller more intimate moments but there are some thrilling action sequences particularly a chase involving Neeson and his daughter played by Maggie Grace. This time around Neeson finds him and his family being hunted by the relatives of the people he killed in the first film while on vacation. The plot is a little shallow and the direction feels very unrefined and amateurish unlike the first films stylish, sophisticated but gritty execution. A lot of the film feels very hammy but I guess thats the point, it almost seems to be making fun of itself and it's absurdities. Still the proceedings are engaging enough to merit a solid recommendation. Although ultimately unnecessary it still makes for above average entertainment especially if you were a fan of the first film. One of my big complaints though and hopefully they will rectify it in the next film which I'm sure is coming out is can Maggie Grace please play her age no one is buying this young girl routine but kudos to her on her involvement on some of the action especially that breath taking rooftop chase."

","OK, so let me start by saying that the first film was one of those sleeper hits that come out once every 1 - 2 years, i thoroughly enjoyed it in the cinema, not knowing what i was expecting going in. The acting was solid, script good and some excellent action scenes.<br/><br/>This brings me on to Taken 2. Although the acting was nearly on a par with the first one, i felt that it lacked conviction. Some of the ""Albanian"" acting was questionable at best.<br/><br/>The action scenes seemed to want to impress while being lazy. How do grenades help work out distances/locations on a map??<br/><br/>Finally, my biggest problem with this film was its rating. Here in Ireland, the movie was released with a 12's certificate. I get the impression that the movie was seriously edited to obtain this certificate, it leaves the moving almost violence free and at times lacking understanding,(spoiler alert)for example, at the end when the main antagonist bites the bullet, it doesn't show how he dies, simply that Mills pushes him against a wall and then Game Over.<br/><br/>I'm afraid to say, this film sold itself out for that pre teens 12 rating, and in doing so, sacrificed its creditability.<br/><br/>An only average 5 stars from me, purely because Neeson was on board."
"cyifly-2","5","0","0","18 October 2012"," Did anybody edit this movie?
","Taken was a surprisingly good film. Original, suspenseful, well-acted, well-written, well-directed. Taken 2 is about as original as it's title. It's fun, in parts. It's an OK way to kill a few hours. But it's not at all well-done. I'm wishing I went to Argo instead. There are so many editing errors that I don't even know where to begin. It's like they just threw this thing together and didn't put much effort or thought into it. Most of the characters seem to just walk through their lines. The dialog is forced and contrived. The writing is just plain bad. Even the bad guys have cheesy lines. If you need mindless entertainment, it's OK. If you are looking for a good sequel to a good movie (which didn't need a sequel), then this is not it.<br/><br/>Spoilers ahead -- I'm going to name the BIGGEST, GROSSEST errors in editing that I have ever seen in a movie. These are just the ones I can think of off the top of my head: 1. The daughter fails a US driving test twice driving an 'easy' Camry with an automatic transmission. Later on she's driving a foreign car through the streets of a foreign country like a stunt driver -- with a stick-shift.<br/><br/>2. The mother was cut in the neck (jugular) and left hanging upside down with a hood on to bleed out. Blood was coming through the hood. Liam said she was going to bleed out in less than 30 mins - meaning there was going to be a lot of blood if he didn't get to her. A whole body's worth... Later and through most of the rest of the movie, she's passed out from blood loss. When the hood comes off, no blood on her face or hair, and she doesn't bleed any more through the rest of the movie. She would not even need a Band-Aid with the little bit of blood on her cheek.<br/><br/>3. The father tells the daughter to throw down her phone and run. She does, then she has her phone later.<br/><br/>4. They drive through gunfire, a few vehicles, and a small building to get to the front lawn of the US Embassy. They had hit several vehicles and got broadsided by an SUV in the process. When they get to the Embassy lawn, not only are the guards not shooting anymore or rushing the car, the car doesn't even have a dent in it and Liam has time to make a phone call and has a lengthy conversation with his daughter.<br/><br/>5. A moment after driving through the guard shack of the US Embassy, Liam is walking around town alone (not arrested or even questioned) looking for the bad guys.<br/><br/>6. The giant briefcase in the hotel full of guns and grenades isn't explained -- At least I didn't catch it.<br/><br/>7. The daughter detonates grenades on top of buildings in a populated city and no one even walks out or calls the police.<br/><br/>8. Dad tells daughter to find him by 'looking for steam' and she finds him by coincidentally walking up to a rooftop metal pipe with steam coming out of it... like there aren't a hundred of those in a city like this? <br/><br/>9. With all the car chasing, grenades, gunfire and chaos, no police were seen in the whole movie.<br/><br/>10. Liam is kidnapped with no jacket, then has a cool leather coat after escaping...Where did he get it?<br/><br/>11. Vehicles were driving maybe 40mph, hitting each other practically head-on and magically flipping through the air.<br/><br/>12. Isn't 11 enough? You pick one... I'm sure you would see some I didn't list. There has to be more.<br/><br/>There were more -- This is just what I can remember off the top of my head. So many of them, it got to be funny and took away from the few redeeming qualities of the movie.<br/><br/>Bottom Line -- I've seen worse. It's not horrible. But when I can spot such blatant editorial mistakes like this, it made me stop paying attention to the movie and looking for other mistakes -- Like a game. If you need time to kill, it's got some entertainment value. If you love Taken and are hoping for a good sequel, skip it. Don't even rent it. It isn't here."

","Judging from the trailer, I didn't think this would be as good as the first movie. It's not as suspenseful (we don't see enough of the bad guys) as the events in Paris, but it's nevertheless an entertaining sequel. I suppose it's not as suspenseful because the characters (the Millers) have been in this situation before, so there aren't any real surprises. I wouldn't say the final confrontation between Neeson and the head honcho is a letdown, but it doesn't deliver the way it's supposed to. But that's just a quibble. If you're looking for something completely different, then this is probably isn't for you.<br/><br/>*** out of ****"
"DubhDoo","3","0","0","18 October 2012"," Liam Neeson's 2012 started off so well, but alas...
","Frankly, I feel that Taken should have remained in the straight-to-video dungeon where it belonged - even Neeson himself didn't expect a theatrical release - but it became a hit and the man who was once Oskar Schindler became a action hero. A sequel was inevitable, and well, here we are.<br/><br/>While away in Istanbul, with his ex-wife (Famke Janssen) and teenage - yeah, right - daughter (Maggie Grace), Bryan Mills is targeted by a cabal of clichéd foreigners who want revenge for the deaths of their brothers and friends (""Ve will haf our rewenge!""), who Mills slaughtered ""like they ver so many nuthinks"". This time, him and his wife are kidnapped, and it's their daughter who must save them.<br/><br/>Yes, I'm aware Taken was supposed to be stupid, OTT 'fun', but I found it dull and wasn't enthusiastic at the thought of a follow-up, and with this sequel new director Olivier Megaton delivers a film worse predecessor. Aside from Mr. Neeson, the film's main draw are the action sequences, here however, they might as well have been shot with potato. Whether a conscious decision or due to cuts to receive the mass audience- friendly 12A/PG-13, the action is sloppy and shoddily edited; each fight sees Neeson square off against some not-at-all stereotypical foes in a frenzy of shakycam, resulting in an incomprehensible flurry of fists and kicks. If it's a bid for a broader certificate, then it makes it seem as if he's censoring people to death, sending them to the cutting room floor, not the grave.<br/><br/>The only thing that makes this thing bearable is of course, Liam Neeson, remaining an engaging presence in the midst of it all, delivering lines such as ""When a dog has a bone, the last thing you should do is take it from him"", or possibly my favourite, ""Kim, I want you to remain calm, your mother and I have been... taken"". The fact he said such clunkers with a straight face gave me something to enjoy in an otherwise unexciting and turgid affair. There's one thing this film is sorely lacking and that's a sense of novelty and fun. C'mon Liam, you can do better."

","The movie is quite good but really there's so much errors in the making... 1- locations in Istanbul are nearly all wrong! When you take the ferry as Liam did from Sirkeci, you end up on the Asian side. But the movie continues on the European side?!? These police cars are no longer used, in fact since the 80's we don't have those ones. Now we have Nissan juke, mini cooper, navara... Istanbul isn't like this at all! You see everywhere 'ninja' disguised women! Come and see how modern and open we are. Sure there are extremists like this but it's not the whole population like described in the movie!!!!!!! When you see people like this on a movie based in turkey it's for sure you'll ask us if we ride camels and stuff.... And the USA embassy doing Hollywood stuff here? In fact due to their fear they have built a fortress on a hill and nobody could come near like this in a taxi (we don't use Mercedes as taxis, we have Hyundai, fiat, Toyota, and we don't use walkie talkies, we have mobile phones with pushtotalk feature for the cab drivers). And also the us embassy is like 30min of car ride from the actual places where the movie is shot, in 30 seconds they end up in the embassy, not possible. And also the route going to the embassy is nothing like described in the movie. If you want to do a movie about Istanbul, or that is actually happening in Istanbul, please directors, film makers, producers, come to Istanbul and live here for a month or two and see the places for yourself. Afterwards you can be judging Istanbul and turkey more easily and describing it with perfect accuracy. But don't do shitty movies like this, making look like third world countries. Mafia doesn't rule anything here."

The french cop is thrown in there for some reason although why he would keep track of neeson's character is a mystery .

","Many people (including me) expected to be a continuation of the first great movie. However, this new release takes more time trying to create the right atmosphere for the kidnapping, that forget the action scenes that everybody was waiting for. The Albanian Grandpa begins as a ""big bad guy"" that cries for revenge and blood in his son's grave; during his quest he could infiltrate international government agencies in search of Bryam Mills (Liam Nesson). However, the character is going down at every moment and seems to lack his goal. Finally, he is only a cornered coward that couldn't take a chance for redemption. Honestly, I would not expect too much for this new release, Nevertheless, once more Liam Nesson 's performance is outstanding."

","Liam Neeson's cult hero, ex-CIA Agent Bryan Mills returns with his leather jacket to terminate another band of scumbags, who are seeking revenge for the zillions he dispensed with Steven Segal-style in 2008's 'Taken'. <br/><br/>This time the ethnic cleansing occurs in Istanbul, where Mills invites his daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace) and his ex, Lenore (Famke Jannsen) to escape the stress of their lavish lifestyle. When mum and dad are abducted, Kim (who has admirably recovered from the trauma of being sex-trafficked in the first film) takes surreptitious instructions from dad about how to find them so that he can 'do what he does best'. <br/><br/>Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen stay on as screenwriters, but Olivier Megaton, whose claim to shame was that he helmed 'Transporter 3', replaces Pierre Morel as director. First mistake. The second mistake these three men make is to hint that Neeson is too old. True, he turned 60 this year, but with moves like his you wouldn't accept anyone else as back up. <br/><br/>The third mistake is the substitution of explosions for emotions. My heart sank when they reduced the certificate from '15' to the dreaded '12A'; a clear signal that the violence would be softened and the death tally lowered. You can bet your life there'll be more sequels, so why not leave this mushy plot for number five?<br/><br/>Spurred on by songs from the 'Drive' soundtrack, Kim intrepidly goes in search of her parents, but not without blowing up half of Turkey and its denizens in the process. I was so proud of her. She hadn't yet passed her driving test, or got to make out properly with her boyfriend and look what her security-conscious father was making her do.

","I Don't know anyone who didn't like the original ""Taken."" But it was a fluke. No one knew it would become as popular as it did. So pulling off a successful sequel was always going to be hard work. Knowing what worked so well first time round and trying to recapture that without merely repeating it.<br/><br/>""Taken 2"" is at least trying to be as different as possible. Instead off Liam Neesons daughter once again being taken, or maybe making it someone else. The plot takes a different approach by having people (connected too the people Neeson ""punished"" in the last movie) take the man himself, as well as going after his ex-wife and daughter. This means the film isn't just a rehash off number one, and they've really upped the action to try and improve it too.<br/><br/>Unfortunately though, its still lacking something. I was nowhere near as invested as I was in the first movie. That time you were rooting for Neeson to get his revenge, while here if feels more as if he's just randomly shooting a bunch off bad-guys. Although the story has changed, the action seems to be repeating itself, with fist fights, shoot-outs, and car chases, all squeezed in purely because they were in the first film. The anticipation that comes with this one makes it feel more disappointing and short (even though its probably the same length) plus its nowhere near as brutal with its 12 (PG-13) certificate.<br/><br/>Saying that though, it could off been worse. I Liked the fact it had more off Maggie Grace and Famke Janssen In it (Oooft) and had a bit more humour. Though its cheesy ""police squad"" type ending overdid it."

","The Pacing of this film is quite good. It lacks any really iconic moments and the villain struggles to have any real depth to his character. the strategy is well structured, but exists within the confines of an action movie . so the plot is as far fetched as the original taken film ends. there are few interesting visual cues. the broken gate to wife's house , after a scene with digital clock and the word 'security.' in fact the camera work is well crafted. most of the violence in the film is lethargic. at one point liam neeson says 'i am tired of the killing.' and it does show. the most aggressive part of the film is an impromptu driving lesson. this is the golden dialogue part. like the phone/kitchen and electric chair scenes in the 1st. there is a passionate father daughter exchange of 'i can't.' - 'do it now.' otherwise the acting is pretty shallow. but still it is not a terrible movie.which manages to sustain a mild level of threat throughout. even through there is no sadistic torture or drug use in this film. the editing is done in a way where it is suggested but still to allow for a 12a rating in the uk. an okay movie."

Taken 2 however leaves the watcher to imagine what acts take place as the camera diverts away from kills, and with a scene showing Liam Nilsen as a one man army it turns into nothing more than a cartoon fight with loud sounds but nothing to see.

The idea to actually capture the Liam Neeson character and then let the daughter help him just didn't fit very well. And to have her ludicrously throwing grenades so that he could be located felt particularly ridiculous. In hindsight it felt that the film makers knew they had a captive audience and really didn't try to any much more to the franchise. Think Quantum of Solace's relationship with Casino Royale and you will get what I mean. An opportunity missed me thinks.

I think the main cause of this is Neeson, he is great especially at acting the caring father, which carries the main storyline, but in this film he is simply not as energetic as he has been in previous films, I know this is because he is getting older, but it really destroys the point in the film.<br/><br/>So what they have tried to do in this film is make it look as though Neeson is getting older and is a little more tired than the previous Taken film, this makes him look even more exhausted as a character, and although all of his lines are given with the sentiment of love behind them to his family, because of the way he is portrayed many of his lines lack emotion enough to make them interesting.<br/><br/>There were many other annoying plot holes such as the point Neeson's character calls his life 'Honey' throughout even though they're not together, a little irritating to say the least, as well as the end left with whether he got back with her at the very end, completely unanswered, but at least we know whether the daughter passed her driving test by completing a perfect parallel park! <br/><br/>It was the pushing forward of trivial parts of the story such as the useless involvement of the boyfriend purely to make a semi-funny joke at the end, its was kind of frustrating. Are they setting things up for Taken 3 where the boyfriend is taken, and Neeson is too tired to go save him, just spit balling ideas, a little weird though.<br/><br/>The fighting scenes were also short and the camera switched about so much to look like action, when nothing was really happening. You got a sense of Neeson's former epicosity but it wasn't there as much as in previous films. There's also small other issues like the amount of damage that is done in this film to other peoples property is completely forgotten about, and even though people have been killed everyone gets away with it, its a little odd.<br/><br/>Nevertheless I still enjoyed this film even with all of its holes, but don't expect something spectacular, but may be the last time you see Neeson in an action role."

","A lot of reviewers went on about realism. Was that really the point of the movie? I enjoyed it for what it was: An action movie and nothing more. While I'm willing to admit that the first one was way better (who would have thought that Liam Neeson could be that ruthless and powerful?)than this one. The story was straightforward - no compromises. We saw our hero do things, a hero normally wouldn't. (Shoot Jean-Claude's innocent wife in the arm, finish of Marko after getting the information needed, etc.) Taken 2 had a difficult task. They ""had"" to basically make the same movie again, without using the same tricks as before. So yeah, it's pretty silly to have your daughter throw grenades all over the place in order to locate your position. But also fun, right? And yes, a kid who has yet to pass the driving exam would have driven that car straight into a wall or a bystander. It seems impossible to drive through a crowded city doing, say, 80km/h and not one soul is harmed. But: They tried something different. Why not? And the finale? I liked it. The final fight was intense (even though it didn't match the showdown of part 1) So... a 7 is probably too high a rating. But I was entertained. And that's what I want from a movie: to be entertained!"

","It was enjoyable that the daughter was not a victim in this and was more of a ""daddy's girl"". Tossing grenades and driving bad in another country always spells good times. But I have to give kudos to the ""force kill"" used at the end. Famke Janssen was much less of a bitch in this. It was a little odd that he didn't just save her ass sooner instead of going back. However it did give him a chance to have a mortal combat moment. That being said it was a bit cheesy to go that route. His character seems a little to smart to go that way with him. The last at least 10 min are filler, filler, filler. It was still a fun movie to watch."
"mike-3842","5","0","0","12 October 2012"," Unintentionally Hilarious
","I think most of us were pretty impressed with Taken. It had tense non- stop action and there was a perfect rationale for everything which was happening. It took place in the lair of the Albanian Mafia who were firmly installed in Paris, and where it was perfectly believable that there could be 100 bad guys to mow down. Brian Mills would stop at nothing to save his daughter.<br/><br/>Not so in Taken 2. It takes place in Istanbul where the bad guys have gone to find Mills to get revenge for what he did to them in the first film. In Taken 2 The Albanians don't have an established local operation and they seemingly come from nowhere in unlimited numbers every time Mills guns a few more down. <br/><br/>But what is worse, (or better if you find goofs amusing) about this film is that it is so bad that it's funny. I really cannot believe Luc Besson put his name on this. Mills ALWAYS does things the hardest way possible. I mean sometimes you are just thinking ""damn it man call an ambulance, or the police. Your ex wife is dying on the floor and all you have to do is make a call"". Others you are thinking ""he's trapped and calling from a mobile phone. It's easy for the police to triangulate the signal and find him, but no, he has his daughter set off grenades one after the other in the middle of Istanbul so he can tell her how to find him by listening where the explosions are coming from"". There is even a moment where the bad guys pile his ex wife into a van and he is literally 10 metres away and doesn't bother to make chase. Not that he has anything else to do....<br/><br/>Mills has an uncanny knack of walking the streets with no idea of where he is going and suddenly stumbling back onto the trail completely by accident. <br/><br/>He storms the US embassy instead of just walking up to the door and asking to come in. Once he is inside he calls a friend in high places who diffuses the situation. But why doesn't he just call this guy instead of driving at high speed through a bunch of soldiers with machine guns - with his daughter at the wheel of the car I might add!<br/><br/>Oh and the kill scenes are just too funny. There is a moment where Mills pushes a baddie nonchalantly in the face and he dies instantly. I laughed out loud at that moment. It was really priceless. <br/><br/>I highly enjoyed this film because it gave me many laughs, but I am 99% sure that it was not supposed to be that way. It's just a sloppy lazy sequel. Best have a few beers before you watch :)))"

My friends said after, that the first film was better but I would recommend it because it was good but don't get your hopes up if you have already seen the first one and expected this one to be better because it isn't. I don't think they should have made another film because it is basically the same as the first but a different person gets taken."
"ghost_dog86","3","0","0","12 October 2012"," Taken as well.
","As far as by the numbers revenge movies go, ""Taken 2"" is nothing more than a tamed down (PG-13) cinematic impersonation of its undeniably entertaining predecessor. Directed by Olivier Megaton, the beginning of ""Taken 2"" sees the return of Liam Neeson as retired CIA agent Bryan Mills, visibly distressed by the revelation that his daughter has started dating boys behind his back. But that's not the sole reason for his aggravation, because not only has his daughter betrayed his trust, it also comes to light that she has been skirting her driving lessonsafter having already failed her test 4 times! Wait, what's with all of this storyline?! Get to the ""taking"" already! Anyway, after about thirty minutes or so, there is a story centered around the father of one of the men Bryan had killed in the previous film (who distractingly resembles The Most Interesting Man in the World) taking it upon himself to exact revenge on Bryan's entire family, by attempting to TAKE themhostage. And while moments (very few) of this particular storyline do contain a sort of likeness to what one might call ""entertainment"", ""Taken 2"" ends in abysmally cheesy style, with one of the most (although incredibly quick) tacked on finales I've seen in recent years; befitting a straight to video production. To those who think I am harping on ""Taken 2"" for its predictable storyline, I'm not. Because that, as well as the (I would suspect) very intentional corniness throughout, is quite forgivable; and is in fact what I expected from a movie called ""Taken 2"". What isn't forgivable is the fact that the direction, especially during the fight sequences (aka the most important sequences of the movie) was mostly undecipherable. And even when the camera settled down enough for audiences to distinguish who is being hit, said fight scenes were utterly uneventful and terribly choreographed; clearly highlighting a Liam Neeson that can't move around so well anymore. And does it make me sound morbid that I was very upset not to see any type of torture scene in this movie? I can't be the only one.<br/><br/>Allow me to go one step further by saying ""Taken 2"" is riddled with a cornucopia of stupid scenes, which all together ruin any ""coolness factor"" it could have had. If you don't believe me, here's a very long example: <br/><br/>After Bryan Mills and his wife (or ex-wife, or whatever) are cornered by the Albanian ""bad guys"" at gunpoint, Bryan proceeds to take out his cell phone and call his daughter (who is still back at the hotel). The ""bad guys"" apparently let him do this for some reason. Anyway, he explains to his daughter that his wife (or ex-wife, or whatever) are going to be ""taken"" and that she must now hide because Albanians are likely coming to ""take"" her as well. Upon hearing this, his dumb daughter doesn't seem to know where to hide (it's not like she hasn't done this before) so Bryan tells her, right in front of the ""bad guys"", to hide in the closet. OK, so this happens about 45 minutes into the movie, but here's the thing: It had already been established many times before that the ""bad guys"" spoke and understood English. But it comes to be, that even though Bryan tells his daughter where to hide, right in front of the ""bad guys"", in a language everyone in the film seems to understand, the ""bad guys"" still can't seem to locate her brilliant hiding space. But maybe I'm overthinking this. I guess it could have been that the ""bad guys"" simply forgot how to understand English in that moment, or maybe Neeson's accent was just too thick for them to comprehend? I don't know. Anyway, this movie is filled with scenes of that nature, including an inane and rather long sequence, which involves Bryan's daughter throwing grenades off of rooftops, with seemingly no reaction from the locals. <br/><br/>Final Thought: ""Taken 2"" is what happens when Hollywood producers attempt to milk every last drop of story out of an original premise that wasn't that deep to begin with. Not to say that this is entirely unwatchable, between Neeson's dry comedic timing and his facial expressions which seem to say ""how many minutes until we break for the day?"" there are moments of levity that could be seen as ""so bad that it's good"" camp. But, by the end of ""Taken 2"", it will have become apparent to everyone in the theater that not even Neeson (the newest Hollywood action hero) could have saved a movie that is destined to be shown at 3 A.M. on Showtime. <br/><br/>Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I.

"crowby","6","0","0","11 October 2012"," A bit disappointing
","As a fan of the original I went in to see this with a fairly open mind, having read no reviews and seeing it within a few days of the UK release. There are a number of disappointing aspects to this sequel, but the most general one is the script. From early on in the film, the dialogue being spoken by the actors sounds quite awkward and clunky. The set up / premise of the story is good but the way the action unfolds seems very rushed with very little of the attention to detail or use of Bryan Mills (Neesons) information finding skills that entertained us in the first film.<br/><br/>The first film has far fetched aspects but Taken 2 takes these to new levels. As other users have pointed out, the actions of Mills daughter Kim stretch the film's credibility to snapping point. Without wishing to be disparaging about a fictional character, I don't buy that she would be able to do ANY of the things we see her do (apart from perhaps making out with her boyfriend), running across rooftops letting off grenades, driving through the town like the world's greatest stunt driver (who obviously was the one really driving) when she's still struggling to master a reverse park on her driving lessons? No casualties there by the way.<br/><br/>The villains of this film are bumbling buffoons who cannot be taken seriously. These Eastern European sex traffickers we are expected to believe have the martial arts skills of Bruce Lee on speed, yet don't have the mental resources to realise that Brian Mills is not someone to be left alone, and able to then free himself and make phones calls with a pocket device that a blind bat with a bin bag on it's head could find with a quick, non invasive body search.<br/><br/>Seriously, did his kidnappers learn nothing from the previous film? I know they didn't have first hand experience of what a slippery character Brian Mills is, but the fact that he capped pretty much everyone he came into contact with, should provide some clues as to how to handle him. You don't leave him on his own - ever! Some particularly clichéd lines were used to try and justify not killing Brian or his wife at various points, and these were almost comical, sounding more like dialogue from Austin Powers movies that Dr Evil might speak, or from Bond movies of old.<br/><br/>The film is a 12A (UK). I think the first film was a 15 and there was a more hardened version that was an 18. This immediately creates a problem. Much of the violence in Taken 2 is either watered down or suggested and not seen. Yes, lots of people get shot but it's very throwaway action when compared to the first film. A scene where a character is about to get viciously sliced by a knife, because of the film certification, we know will have no pay off, something will stop it happening. Not that I crave any of this, but the whole film has a general weak feel with regards to the violence. Also the villains themselves are no where near menacing or 3 dimensional enough for us to really care what happens to them.<br/><br/>There's an awkward and unsatisfactory ending involving Kim's boyfriend, a barely established character, which is in keeping with the rest of the film. Running at just 90 minutes I think another reason the film suffers is it doesn't have enough time to establish situations, characters or reasoning.<br/><br/>The focus on Brian Mills family as integral characters throughout is perhaps another mistake. We didn't have this in the first film and it was better for it.<br/><br/>This in a nutshell is something that could be billed as 'a violent revenge film with a child friendly film certification'. There in itself is a statement that doesn't sound right but that is what we have, and that should paint a fairly good picture of what to expect.<br/><br/>6/10"

"malaysian1789","6","5","16","4 October 2012"," Taken 2 couldn't live up to high expectations
","A few years ago I got invited to a press screening of Taken, and all I was told about it was that it starred Liam Neeson. Expecting some sort of sophisticated drama about Politics or World War II, imagine my surprise when Taken turned out to be one of my favourite action films of all time, a no-nonsense film that was relentlessly violent and explosive, whilst also featuring the most hilarious one-liners since Arnie starred in Commando (Google it if you haven't seen it!).<br/><br/>Well now we have Taken 2, where retired CIA agent Bryan Mills (Neeson) finds himself on a break in Istanbul with his ex-wife and daughter, unaware that he's being watched by a gang of Albanians, led by the father of a nameless henchman killed in the first film (a weak but plausible basis for the film I guess). As you can guess by the title, somebody gets taken, only this time it's Mills and his wife who are kidnapped, leaving their young daughter Grace as the only one who can help them....<br/><br/>Well this film didn't live up to the expectations I had, for starters it has a lower age rating, meaning that the violence (and main attraction) of the first film is gone. Secondly, the plot felt tiresome, there was no originality to it, no memorable one-liners or moments of brilliance that made it stand out as a great action film, e.g the final, major fight features 6 foot plus Neeson taking on....an overweight Albanian man who can barely move around, which just sums up the laziness of the film. Yes, the film does feature some moments of tension, and the story moves swiftly enough to always keep your attention focused, as a stand alone film I would say it's decent, but as a comparison to it's great predecessor, it's a disappointment.<br/><br/>6/10"

It was also great to Famke Janssen getting more screen time in this film compared to the first one. Maggie Grace was stunningly beautiful and hot as ever in role as Kim Mills. I was a bit surprised with her character though when they turned her into a toughy in this one<br/><br/>My only disappointment was that I wanted to see Sam, Casey and Bernie get more screen time in here as well but I guess, time is limited for all of that. Overall, an improvement over the first film that in my opinion leaves you asking yourself who do you feel more sorry for between Bryan Mills or the Albanians but other than that, nothing much original in this film when compared to the first one"

","I love the first Taken. To me, it is a fine example of an action movie with solid build up, top notch acting, and, well, memorable action sequences. In this day and age, how often does that come along? And when I saw the trailer for the sequel, I knew it wasn't going to be as great as the first one. Still, I figured it'd be a good time at the theater. Was I right? Well...no.<br/><br/>Let's get the good stuff out of the way first. You will never hear me say anything bad about Liam Neeson. The man is one of the few actors today that just demands respect and awe when he enters the room. A perfect example was in Battleship; the movie was awful, but Liam Neeson was one of the few things about that film that worked. And there's no exception here. They did things with the character of Bryan Mills that I didn't agree with, but Neeson is having fun with the part, so I got to respect that.<br/><br/>I was also glad to see more of Famke Janssen in the movie. With so little screen time in the first movie, I was looking forward to seeing more of her in the sequel. And, whether you love her or hate her, Maggie Grace did a fine job as Neeson's daughter. I actually like her character; sort of a spoiled girl who must be...well, competent in order to survive.<br/><br/>Also, the first twenty minutes began to feel like a solid follow up to the first movie. You see the relationship with the family, how Bryan is dealing with his daughter having a boyfriend. There are some pretty funny jokes you can get out of that scenario and they take advantage of the majority of them.<br/><br/>Okay, now that we've got that out of the way, let's talk about the bad stuff. The action in this movie is some of the worst I've ever seen, which is a shame because the action in the first movie was very slick and nicely choreographed. Here, the editing is so choppy and abrupt that you can hardly see what's going on. I haven't seen anything else done by this director, but I hear that his action movies are all this way.<br/><br/>Also the story is sort of a mess. I could follow it fine in the beginning, but as soon as the family arrives in Istanbul, things take a turn for the worse. The pacing suffers tremendously here and there's just too much suspension of disbelief going for me to have bought what was happening. Yeah, there was a lot of that going on in the first movie, but because the action was so great and the pacing was so quick, you didn't question it.<br/><br/>Final verdict: This is a disappointing, unsatisfactory sequel to a phenomenal movie. Basically everything that made the first movie great is the opposite here. It's not horrendous, but there are plenty of other action movies that deserve your time and money. I really don't know who to recommend this movie to, especially if you're a fan of the first movie like I am."

Why? Lets do a simple comparison:<br/><br/>Story: I loved the original's story; unpredictable & keeps you hooked in to your seats waiting to know what is going to happen. However, the sequel's story was sleazy, unrealistic, & most importantly predictable. Sorry i cant give examples as I'm trying to make this review free from spoilers. In this part i blame the writers for not being creative & for insulting viewers' intelligence.<br/><br/>Acting: One of the original's most beautiful scene is when Bryan (Liam) tells his daughter that she is going to be taken. he was able to tell the viewers that he is in control of the situation even when his daughter was being kidnapped in another continent. But what i saw in Taken 2 is over acting. This also applies to the rest of actors specially his family. It was really irritating & felt unrealistic. Whom I'm blaming here? of course the director & not the actors as I saw what they are capable of in the original film.. Advice, director please see Raymond's ""City Island (2009)"" where Famke (Lenore the ""wife"") gave an amazing acting in that movie.<br/><br/>Action: Sorry but i don't call this ""action"" at all as the director kept on changing between several zoomed in & shaky cameras. I was wondering who punched whom (or was it a kick?!). Meanwhile, the first movie contained nice, smooth, & clear moves. Blaming? again director. Advice? please learn from Isaac's work (Undisputed 2 & 3)<br/><br/>An update: sorry forgot to mention that this sequel is very raciest and insults other nations & religions by its hidden massages. So if you are a Muslim or Turkish/Albanian then you will be feeling insulted, & if you are following another religion or comes from a different country then you will be brainwashed with misleading thoughts & ideas."
"dcharold","5","2","5","7 October 2012"," Too many cuts
","OK, everyone knows that Taken is best on video where it has an UK 18 cert rather than the softer 15 shown in cinemas. But the cinema cut was still fine; a good, hard action film. So why on earth have the producers of Taken 2 chosen to take it from a 15 down to a 12A for UK cinema release? The cuts are painfully obvious, to the point where some of the action no longer makes sense, and the soundtrack is woefully anaemic. Performances are largely good and the use of Istanbul is impressive - one hopes that Skyfall gets as much out of the city as Taken 2 has. It's a little vaguely plotted and its not really clear if the villains are really as bad as the ones in the first film or just driven by vengeance. I'll see it again if it's released uncut on video but the film is disappointing in the cinema; all the more so because the good action film it could have been is still visible but drowning beneath a sea of cuts."

","I was hyped after the travesty that was Battleship, in which Liam Neeson was wasted in, I was looking forward for this. Liam Neeson was awesome, has a retired CIA agent who was stopped at nothing to rescue his daughter. I enjoyed the unstoppable force that was Liam Neeson.<br/><br/>Bryan(Liam Nesson) is in Turkey on business, but Kim(Maggie Grace) and Lenore(Famke Janssen) surprise him when they arrive there. And now it's a vacation. But the father to one of the men that Bryan killed in the first film wants revenge, brings his own set of goons. They end up kidnapping Bryan and Lenore, but they have not got Kim yet. Will Bryan stop them before it's too late? <br/><br/>Liam Neeson was the only thing good here, although they went over a little on his character. But the action and fight scenes where poorly put together. Maggie Grace is really starting to look her age, in which I couldn't buy her playing 18-19 year old. And the bad guys here are pretty dumb, to the point that where more funny than frightening. Taken was good, but Taken 2 not so much."
"TheSquiss","3","3","11","5 October 2012"," Predictable, passable & emphatically NOT scripted by David Mamet, more's the pity.
","In terms of the greatest mysteries in the world, why 2008's Taken was given a sequel isn't up there (it's all about the money, money, money). But quite why this Liam Neeson vehicle was green-lit over an A-Team sequel is, however, a mystery. The first installment was enjoyable, the second, cheesy, predictable and lacking any new ideas. Heaven forbid there'll be a third.<br/><br/>Taken 2 occurs a year after Kim (Maggie Grace) is kidnapped and Bryan Mills (Neeson) rampages across Paris to rescue her and kill every last mofo who even thought about being involved. Unfortunately for Mills, on an Albanian hillside cemetery in front of the graves of the eight would-be kidnappers, Murad Krasniqi (Rade Serbedzija, Gregorovitch in Harry Potter & the Deathly Hallows) vows to avenge his son and the other scoundrels in the ground, conveniently overlooking their villainy.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Mills, his ex-wife, Lenore (Famke Jansen), and Kim find themselves holidaying in Istanbul. Leaving her parents to wander the streets, Kim opts for an afternoon in the hotel pool only to be disturbed by a phone call from her dad with the fateful words, ""Kim, your mum and I are gonna to be taken. People are going to come for you too"" And so begins another chase and a fresh crop of corpses.<br/><br/>It's adequate, but that is nowhere near acceptable when dealing with an actor of Neeson's stature. This is the actor that gave us Michael Lamb, Oskar Schindler and Michael Collins. That he also delighted millions as Ra's Al Ghul and Qui-Gon Jinn only adds to his star power. But in the past couple of years he's coasted along with bland performances in a series of poor films that includes Battleship, Clash of the Titans and now Taken 2. Yes, he can run, scowl and shoot at the same time, he snaps necks with conviction and has the good grace to at least feign regret as he snaps another limb but, come on Liam, you're worth so much more than this.<br/><br/>It isn't entirely his fault, though. Some of the dialogue he and his co-stars are required to deliver is pure Gorgonzola. The opening scenes are so filled with stilted exposition that when a brief exchange arrives that doesn't cause one to cringe, it feels as though David Mamet has stepped into the scripting room. To wit: ""Dad, I can't do it."" ""Can you shoot?"" ""No."" ""Then drive."" Okay, after the event it doesn't stand up to much but actually, as those words filled my ears, I felt as though we might be getting somewhere. Yep. That's about the sum of it.<br/><br/>Director Oliver Megaton, who brought us both Transporter 3 and Columbiana, has dipped towards the standard of the former rather than striving to exceed the latter and screenwriter Luc Besson seems to have lost his way completely. Even together they fail elevate Taken 2 to the level of Hostage, Ransom or Panic Room all three of which make the art of kidnapping far more thrilling.<br/><br/>Grace has more fun in Taken 2 than she did in the original and is fairly convincing as the protected daughter forced to find some inner steel, but she's no threat to the likes of Angelina Jolie or even Kate Beckinsale. Jansen fares less well and is largely called upon to simper, smile adoringly at her ex-husband, cry and play at being unconscious. Perhaps if there is a third installment, Mills will be bound and gagged and the girls can have all the action. We can but hope.<br/><br/>As for the villains, most are virtually faceless, have no characters and nothing to identify them from each other, the exception being Krasniqi who instigates the onslaught but is barely involved. What a pity we were not allowed to see his point of view and understand his pain. While we would have still rooted for the heroic trio, Taken 2 would have been a far richer experience if there had at least been some ambiguity and the opportunity to glimpse the other side of the crime before condemning the criminals.<br/><br/>Taken 2 is a predictable, passable way to spend part of an evening but even more forgettable than the original. The risk of spoiling the film prevents me from commenting about some ropy plot devices. I'm sure you know the formula and expect pretty much everything to work out, but does it really need to be so tidy? Couldn't it have had just a little bit of depth? Or have stood up to even a tiny amount of scrutiny? <br/><br/>Ah, there's the mystery!"

","Neeson is back as deadly Bryan Mills in this excellent & intense Sequel to the mega surprise hit, Taken.<br/><br/>""Taken 2"" is one of those sequels that really works & is just as good as the first flick, here Bryan himself & ex-wife are Taken by the father's & family members of Bryan's victims from his Vigilante quest from the first film!!!
That's where this sequel really deserves to exist & isn't just made for ""money"" here the story makes sense & has a meaning behind all the Action.<br/><br/>I think there would be Angry other's from his victims that would want revenge on Bryan, because not only did he slaughter loads of scum but he pretty much destroyed their business of Sex-trafficking, there would be alot of blood-thirsty Criminals wanting him dead.
The story puts Bryan's Daughter from the first film into his shoes of the smart saviour, Maggie Grace is very good here as Kim & is under so much pressure to find her mum & dad before their both killed.
The story is set in Istanbul & a gang of ruthless Albanians are out for revenge.
The pacing is intense & exciting as well as keeping it's very gritty & dark atmosphere from the first film, it's also brutal & violent like we expect from a Liam Neeson action Thriller. Neeson is again serious & solid as Bryan Mills the deadly Ex-CIA Operative & does plenty of skilled fighting & shootouts, the action is slick & gritty!!!
I genuinely loved this sequel as much as i did the First film, i liked the frantic feel of the action sequences & the kick ass fights, it's also scary in the way it shows what's really going on out there all over the world & here we see the dark seedy underbelly of Istanbul, i like the slick & gritty look & the suspenseful atmosphere.<br/><br/>""Taken 2"" is a great sequel & a great Action Thriller in it's own right!!!

"YungTrashcan","3","1","2","24 November 2018"," Taken 2 is a complete betrayal of what made the first movie appealing to began with.
","I'll start this review by saying I enjoyed the first Taken. It didn't reinvent the action-thriller wheel by any means, and the movie probably would have been better if it pushed for an R-rating instead of PG-13, but it was really entertaining and Liam Neeson was great in the role. I also think it's relevant to mention that I haven't watched the movie for a few years, and after seeing this movie a small part of my brain desperately wants to revisit it, either to see if I was wrong about the first movie or to wash the sour taste of the second instalment out of my mouth.<br/><br/>This movie is a bitter disappointment when compared to the first. It started out fine, although there were some early warning signs of what was to follow, such as poorly-edited scenes of people talking that ended in the middle of them, and very on-the-nose dialogue like ""I'm little obsessive that way"" as if to just spell out the character of Bryan Mills to the audience like they were four years old, but apart from that nothing that couldn't have been forgotten once the plot kicked off. However, once the first action sequence crops up the movie descends into a predictable, over-the-top, boring mess, with awful shaky-cam cinematography, generic action music that sounds like it came from a stock website, and flat sound design. I swear to God I heard the same dramatic thud sound effect awkwardly placed throughout the movie at least 20 times.<br/><br/>The biggest problem with the movie is that there are so many elements that made the first one stand out that are almost completely absent from this instalment. For a start, the sex slavery aspect that provided such a compelling reason to root for Neeson in the original is only occasionally mentioned in this one, since the screenplay decided that the lazy ""villains that want revenge after what happened in the previous movie"" plot was the best idea. Another is the lack of Liam Neeson ass-kicking scenes, as the plot of Taken 2 forces his character to take a backseat to being held captive after the first major action scene, and his teenage daughter throwing live grenades onto the streets of Istanbul (yes this actually happens). Then to top it off, whenever there is a scene that delivers on the premise of the original film, it's done with terrible fast-cut editing and the camera shaking like it was operated by a chimp with Parkinsons, all in the name of covering up poor fight choreography.<br/><br/>Basically what I'm trying to get across is that this movie sucks. There are plenty of other action movies out there which are far more entertaining, and because Taken wasn't really a movie that needed a sequel, it's not worth seeing even as a fan of that film. Let's just say I stand corrected when I thought to myself last night before I decided to watch this ""It's a sequel to Taken with the same cast, how much of a downgrade can it be?"""

","Rather inevitable follow-up to ""Taken"" the movie that made Liam Neeson an unlikely action hero, like an older Jason Bourne, by which I men a bunch of bad men come after Liam's family, this time and mother makes three and live, or should that be die to regret it. There is a change of location to Istanbul which means we get some nice establishing shots of the city and one action chase across the rooftops to afford some nice views of the skyline.<br/><br/>Otherwise, Liam is up to his usual tricks of being able to avoid bullets at will, kill a man by just laying his hand on his face, guide his daughter go the baddies lair by having her through grenades all over the city and best of all recreate the route back to the villains himself with a combination of super hearing and total recall which wouldn't embarrass a cross between Superman and Sherlock Holmes.<br/><br/>Oh and there's lots of shooting, killing, fist fights and car chases, the silliest of which being when Liam's daughter tears across town driving like an Indy 500 veteran with her dad in the passenger seat, trying to avoid the pursuing would-be killers and achieving a death- defying race across a railway line which the other car doesn't...before she's even passed her driving-test.<br/><br/>It's all unbelievable nonsense, directed at a furious pace with cross-cuts and multiple shots of the same scene, to a pounding musical backdrop just to further reinforce the feeling that you're actually in the middle of a shoot-em-up-cum-car-chase computer game.<br/><br/>Neeson does his best latter-day John Wayne, but the incompetence of the baddies, plus they seem to have a far-from-threatening family ringleader means that the ending is never in doubt. In fact I'd go as far to say the beginning and middle were never in doubt either, if you've seen ""Taken 1"".<br/><br/>Pretty predictable, passionless stuff all round I'd say."

So, my impression overall is very positive, I did enjoy the fast, furious, straight pace of the movie, the simple plot, the quick exchange of events, and the clear ideas of the script. This is a simple, clear and decent movie, without all the false pretense and puffed-up dialogs. Thas is what made it fun to watch - very straight and rather logical. Some might say the film is predictable and not original, lacking the fresh ideas, but some on, men, when did you last see any real fresh ideas movie?

","Mental note to self: NEVER p*ss Liam Neeson off.<br/><br/>You know all those anonymous henchman, bodyguards, drug dealers etc that action heroes unceremoniously mow down in their quest? Well... you'll never guess what, but it turns out they have families and friends too, all of whom thirst for revenge after what the likes of James Bond and Jason Bourne (Hey, I just noticed, those two have the same initials... weird) have done to their kin. So, as a result, after Neeson acquired a cricket score of bad guy kills in the original, there's consequences for his actions. Namely, being abducted in Istanbul by thugs, during an ill-advised trip with his ex and daughter. But like The Hulk, you don't wanna make him angry, and despite being outnumbered around 50-1, the safe money is still on the Irishman.....<br/><br/>Unlike Taken 1, which was a non-stop pantheon of evermore explicit slaughterings, this one pauses for breath once in awhile to crank up the tension and provide us with some minor character development, with less gory (but nevertheless painful) deaths. This hardly makes it a lesser work though, and watching Neeson use his training to wipe out his aggressors is as exhilarating as ever... this time with a little help from his teenage kid (who is played by an actress in her late 20's. Hmm...). Some may accuse it of racism, seeing as all the evildoers are identikit Muslim men. ""Get a life"" I say, stop acting like Mary Whitehouse and enjoy the show.<br/><br/>Oh and er... Hi Liam.

","Taken 2 is a satisfying sequel to the original Taken film, though this time around feels more Bourne Identity driven in global turmoil and adrenaline action sequences than the international espionage aspect and human trafficking of the first film. This is a theme that I did miss in this return to the franchise but the film clearly makes up for it in the form of high speed chases and heart racing suspense. Taken 2 still does hold on to the themes of a father/daughter bonding in the midst of total insanity and constant assassination attempts but to me it wouldn't be a Taken film without it. The film expands on the previous plot of the first film and wraps it up by the end of this one while delving into more background about the enemy and characters surrounding it.<br/><br/>Overall Taken 2 doesn't bring anything new to the series but continues to allow Liam Neeson to continue his international campaign of badassery to those who would even attempt to ruin his vacation and/or abduct his family members.

","How do you come back from the worst experience in your life? Therapy, denial, maybe some substance abuse? What if, after a relatively short amount of time, you're flung back into a very similar circumstance? I don't imagine that would help.<br/><br/>Sometime after returning to the relative safety of Los Angeles, Bryan Mills (played by Liam Neeson), his ex-wife Lenore (played by Famke Janssen) and their daughter Kim (played by Maggie Grace) are still rebounding from the trauma they suffered. Bryan (Neeson) arrives at Kim's home to give her a driving lesson only to be informed that she is not even in the house. She's with her boyfriend. A boyfriend Bryan knew nothing about, no less. Simultaneously, in Tropoje, Albania, Murad Hoxha, father of deceased kidnapper and human trafficker Marko Hoxha, is attending a funeral service being conducted for his son and his accomplices. Murad (played by Rade Serbedzija) vows to avenge the deaths of his son and his friends. After hearing that a planned vacation to China is cancelled by Lenore's now estranged husband, Bryan invites both Kim and Lenore to join him on a business trip in Istanbul once he's fulfilled his professional obligations. They arrive sooner than expected and, unbeknownst to them, followed by Murad's henchman. Following a family lunch in the marketplace, Kim returns to the hotel. It's immediately apparent to Bryan and Lenore that their daughter hopes privacy and the exotic locale will rekindle feelings of love in her long-divorced parents. While romance does seem to be in bloom between the couple, it is abruptly halted when Murad and his men make their play for the Mills family.<br/><br/>Now, I was and still am a huge fan of the 2008 film. I believe Neeson took a film that would've seemed dull and uninspired in the hands of Jason Statham, Vin Diesel, or any other contemporary action star and elevated it beyond the material. This film, while entertaining and plausible enough for an action/adventure, is the lesser of the two. Of course, there's the fact that it's more of the same and, therefore, less interesting. In addition, while the original depended on Neeson's estimable talent, this film relies heavily on Maggie Grace. A competent actress, sure, but nowhere near as good as Liam Neeson. I enjoyed it about as much as I expected to. That's it."
"illbebackreviews","3","1","2","25 December 2012"," 90 minutes of my life TAKEN!
","I'm writing this review as someone who really loved the first Taken movie. I found the story good, the character Bryan to be great, the acting to be brilliant and most importantly, the action to be superbly filmed and extremely awesome. <br/><br/>Now I came to Taken 2, which is simply said an extremely unnecessary sequel and also an extremely horrible film. The only good thing about this film that kept me watching it was Liam Neeson's superb acting. Everything else was either overdone or underdone. The story was just plain and lame. ""Revenge"" is far too common a theme for action films. That wasn't the biggest problem. The villains in this movie just sucked. I mean, they decide to capture Bryan and his family to torture them to death but later on they only use the mum to lure Bryan. <br/><br/>The villains in Taken were so much better. They actually had screen time, they were evil and they were proud of it. In this film, we have bad guys who just seem like normal nice guys for the majority of the film and occasionally do something bad. I mean, don't let me explain how extremely horrible the last 20 minutes was. That stupid and unnecessary car chase was extremely lame and was too long and boring. Not to mention that it was horribly filmed. I mean, who were the cinematographers in this film???? Was it C3PO!?!?! <br/><br/>The bad cinematography made the couple of minutes of action the goddamn film had completely useless and lame. I mean, take Taken for an example. That film had a lot of suspense action. There were lots of murder because the bad guys were much bigger and powerful. In this film, we have about 10 bad guys and that's it. Huh!?!?! <br/><br/>The directors forgot that Taken was simply a badass action movie. What made Bryan so badass in the first was that he was all by himself and no matter what happened to him, he was determined to go to the very end to save his daughter. That was great! Now, we have Taken 2 where he tells his daughter to throw grenades to see how close she is. I mean, did he ever think about anything??? The girl could've been killed, other innocent people themselves could've died. Its just all stupid<br/><br/>Let me talk about the final confrontation between Bryan and the main bad guy, whose name I can hardly remember after watching this traumatizing film. That scene was extremely horrible. I've seen many horrible films in my life, but this scene made the film the more worse. I understand, there was some emotion. It was great to see that. But, what the hell is with the way that the guy died!?!?! All Bryan did was touch his damn face! How can someone die like that???? That has to be the stupidest death scene, next to Boba Fett's death, to a stupid villain. <br/><br/>Let me quickly describe the few minutes of lame action this film had. It can easily be described as painful to watch, boring and repeated action. Seriously, the fighting looked extremely stupid. I saw a few cases in which people died just by getting their faces touched. The punching looks extremely fake, just all in fast forward. I mean, this isn't Neo vs Agent Smith from the 1999 Matrix. It was a terrible terrible experience.<br/><br/>Don't watch this CRAP. It hurts/."
"koptagel","2","1","2","25 December 2012"," Lots of Hollywood clichés also lots of questions
","I will not question the lameness of the movie, nor some stupid details like how the daughter who could barely drive an automatic car, can suddenly drive a stick gear like Michael Schumacher.<br/><br/>I can even understand why the movie portrayed Istanbul like a middle-African county where you can explode hand grenades in mid-day and where all women wear scarfs and veils. This could be done intentionally to create a dark environment from where the hero (Liam Neeson) would save his family... (same thing was also done for Paris - to some extend)<br/><br/>However, I cannot explain some extremely illogical details like: - Why they didn't take the girl as soon as she was alone at the hotel, and they waited until her father warns her? - Once Liam Neeson had successfully described his whereabouts to his daughter, why didn't she go to US consulate (Not US embassy because it's in Ankara!) to call for help, instead he called her to help him with guns and grenades? - Why did they crash-drove a taxi into the US consulate and risked being shot at the gates by soldiers (which they miraculously survived) ? Couldn't they walk into the consulate and ask for help? - And finally, when Liam Neeson discovered their nest, why all bad people tried to take his wife and run away rather than just kill her? In fact they were holding her to get to Liam who was now on their doorstep ?<br/><br/>I probably missed bunch of other details, but I think that's enough to prove that the movie needed a little more care than that..."

","Taken 2 is exactly what you'd expect. Liam Neeson is relentless in protecting his family and will kill anyone who gets in his way. I found myself getting into the movie and caring for his wife and daughter. The chase scenes were well done and action packed. It's not exactly a deep film, however it was a fun experience.<br/><br/>I enjoyed Liam Neeson's part, but had the feeling it was the same part Steven Seagal would have played 20 years ago. They both had the mysterious agency past and special training, hand-to-hand fighting skills and equally deadly with a gun.<br/><br/>Maggie Grace was perfect for the role of his daughter.<br/><br/>The Istanbul location was both exotic and gritty, making it ideal.<br/><br/>I recommend this film."

","I ignore all the annoying and false things like they chose to shoot the movie in the worst possible streets, the girl can freely throw grenades in crowded streets of Istanbul, the Turkish police using junkie cars and 80% of the women in Turkey are covered in black sheets... However, there's one more grave mistake that can't be overstated. What the hell is ""US Embassy"" doing in Istanbul? US embassy is in Ankara where is the capital of the country! There's only a ""US consulate"" in Istanbul, that has a nice and mighty building which they could have and should have used. You don't have to be an expert on Turkey to make a movie there, but being unaware of its true capital and presenting another city as capital reveal a unique level of ignorance.<br/><br/>And the story in general was weak. It's obvious that they wanted to make more money from success of the first movie. You can watch it for guns and blazings."
"bushtony","7","1","2","22 December 2012"," Taken 2 Far?
","Essentially a rehash of the first movie that seems to lack that films' pervasive sense of malevolence, danger, urgency and visceral gut-punch. This sequel is more of a by-the-numbers action workout that is a bit less coherent and engaging.<br/><br/>That said, I don't think it quite deserved the stomping it got from the critics. It's well choreographed, the chases are quite exhilarating, and the shaky-cam is not really all that intrusive or troublesome. Cinematography is crisp and clear. Script and dialogue are as baseline functional and brain-dead as one would expect and there are no artistic pretensions whatsoever about the project. Although the violence is somewhat less explicit this time, it remains pleasingly jarring and bone-crunching, so the lack of a prohibitive adult rating is not missed overmuch.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson remains a class act throughout and as an exercise in watching a superb performer in action man mode capping lots of sleazy foreign types it does the business with some skill. Let's face it, the xenophobe in all of us is catered for admirably and the motif of a lone hero blowing loads of swarthy scumbags to kingdom come is an action movie staple that has some lasting appeal. So there's that main attraction.<br/><br/>If you liked the first, chances are you'll get some mileage out of this even though the basic premise seems to be running out of road. I do think a third entry in the series might be pushing it."
"gce-561-690232","1","1","2","21 December 2012"," So many ridiculous errors
","I am a Turkish-American who lives in Istanbul. The movie was pathetically bad in terms of containing so many geographical, historical and cultural errors. It was almost unbearable for me to watch knowing Istanbul and the life here.<br/><br/>First of all, most of the action seems to take place in the Old Historical City of Istanbul. It's unique in its arrangement and really doesn't reflect the rest of the city. That's fine, but the whole movie was so horrible in terms of the plot and how the action takes place. Here are a few gross errors:<br/><br/>1. When they are kidnapped at first and placed in a van, the van goes on to a car ferry and crosses over the Bosphorus from the Old City (European-side) to the Asian side which is probably 15-20 km away. Yet, later on when Liam Nielson's character calls his daughter, she is just a few kilometers away still in the Old City.<br/><br/>2. There is no US Embassy in Istanbul, as the Embassy is in the capital city Ankara. There is a US Consulate and it's far from the Old City in a more modern area of the city. Wow! How ridiculous to have 50 caliber heavy duty machine guns and fully armed Marines outside the so-called Embassy right on the street. They shoot at the taxi, but the taxi has a few small bullet holes in it. That kind of heavy armament would completely rip the taxi into pieces. And then they drive right through a stupid little police booth and are in the courtyard of the so-called Embassy. By the way, that is not the US Consulate in Istanbul. It's in a different location and it's like a Ft Knox sitting on top of a hill surrounded by huge walls at the bottom of the hill. There is no way to drive into it. Marines don't stay on the outside with heavy machine guns on tripods in full battle gear, Turkish police and private security do.<br/><br/>3. The girl who couldn't even pass her driving test in the US with an automatic transmission car all of a sudden is an expert rally driver driving a stick shift through the narrow, crazy streets of the Old City. By the way, there is so much traffic there that it's bumper to bumper, it's impossible to speed through any street in Istanbul like that, especially in the middle of the day.<br/><br/>4. The girl is running around throwing grenades all over the city and nothing happens. It's ludicrous.<br/><br/>I am so tried of these movies that literally INSULT OUR INTELLIGENCE. Pathetic excuse for a movie. Taken 1 was a great movie. This one is a total mess. At least call it the US Consulate, man!!!"

","Luc Besson as a writer/producer, with Liam Neeson and Famke Janssen starring - and the outcome is an intense thriller with lots of chases, bursts and explosions. The pace is always present (apart from the very beginning), and not much time is wasted on reasoning or moralizing. Neeson looks still great and fit - he was almost 60 years old during the filming! - and Janssen has her pleasant charm allowing to depict both sweet and sinister characters. Maggie Grace as their daughter impressed me less than in Taken in 2008. Rade erbedija has always been a great villain depicter. Another exotic supporting actor is the city of Istanbul...

","Liam Neeson really should be ashamed of himself for 'starring' in this film and its predecessor. Just because films are a hit, if they are so full of prejudice against Albanians/middle eastern people they simply don't deserve to be made. The French (responsible for this film) don't always have a great track record with Albanians (UN criticised France for expelling an Albanian family in 2008) and this simplistic, mean-spirited and stereotyped portrayal of Albanians seems like a xenophobic expression of the worst aspect of some in France. The film itself is preposterous, with grenades going off yet little sign of the Turkish police and the villains leaving the hero with plenty of time and opportunity to escape. Usually to provide balance Hollywood films would have one 'good Albanian' helping the hero - but every single Albanian in this is a greasy, hateful thug - no balance provided by the French here. Ultimately I was rooting for the Albanians to put Neeson's character and his family out of their misery - and mine. Of course, they all get their comeuppance and none of the family dies. Total, miserable trash."

Another positive was the impressive cinematography, filmed on location, which gave a real insider's view of Istanbul.<br/><br/>A forgettable sequel with a ridiculous storyline that does not do justice to the original movie.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, many may enjoy the movie purely for it's action scenes... as long as no attention is paid to the barely believable plot."

"aayush-vij","7","1","2","22 October 2012"," Turkish Thrill
","Four years after 'Taken' became an unexpected blockbuster and turned Liam Neeson into an action star overnight, Luc Besson returns to write the sequel, helmed by Olivier Megaton this time. 'Taken 2' has Neeson reprising his role as Bryan Mills, the lethal ex-CIA operative from the predecessor. Famke Janssen and Maggie Grace return as his ex-wife and daughter, respectively. Set roughly two years after the events of the first film, 'Taken 2' begins with the blood relatives of the Albanian sex traffickers from the original swearing revenge on Bryan, led by Murad (Rade Sherbedgia) . Bryan meanwhile, is still overprotective about his daughter. When he invites his ex-wife and daughter to a vacation in Istanbul after providing security to an Arab sheikh, it's only a matter of time when the holiday goes awry.<br/><br/>Now 'Taken' was no piece of great cinema. It had a simple plot but was an excellently executed film with great hand-to-hand action sequences. 'Taken 2' is pretty much the same, but thankfully doesn't follow the exact blueprint of the prequel, like the massively disappointing 'Hangover 2' did. This film throws up an interesting situation where Bryan and his ex-wife are captured, and it is up to their daughter to rescue them. Armed with every possible weapon in his briefcase and a remarkable ability to find a needle in a haystack, Neeson does here 'what he does best'. He perfectly slips into the character of Bryan Mills and makes him a relatively believable person compared to what most action stars in this role would have done. The supporting cast do their jobs adequately. <br/><br/>I am a huge fan of hand-to-hand action sequences and this one has plenty of it. One of the highlights here is a thrilling car chase involving a cab around the halfway mark. Another thing worth noting is that the film doesn't overstay it's welcome. At a crisp 90 minutes, it makes for a lazy,popcorn-laden afternoon. <br/><br/>Now there are big plot holes here and there, but despite all of that, 'Taken 2' delivers exactly what everyone wanted. Liam Neeson kicking some serious ass. Admit it,not even you can say 'no' to that."

The start was OK like but then after reaching Istanbul the movie pieces and fragments went missing and the whole thing seemed misplaced. The best goose bump mockeries my friends made were:the scene where his wife and himself were being kidnapped and he is seen calling his daughter in mobile and saying we are going to be kidnapped and hide yourself, then whenever a phone is needed to be taken it goes silent(with boyfriend and in pool) that maybe iOS problem thats what friends mocked,then she had been running over the roof tops for several minutes but still Liam caught up with her and killed the guy with shot in seconds,then his patching up with his ex wife after his wife and now husband doesn't ring bells well, the action sequence were not as stunning as first and then her driving car even when she is saying I cant I cant. This time daughter comes to rescue hope in third part his wife doesn't go to rescue.

","Spoilers!!<br/><br/>1. want to see Liam act? fine. it's good as usual. this is the last good thing about this movie. 2. want to see action? forget it! I am a huge fan of the The Bourne Identity. I love the whole trilogy but the shaky cam in 2 and 3 was barely acceptable. This is the best example I have seen of it completely not allowing you to see the fighting taking place. It is a combination of shaky cam and split second cuts. It will literally hurt your eyes trying to figure who is hitting who and how. 3. bad guys. Not one henchman that seemed like a match for Liam. The one guy that was supposed to be his tough fight was surprisingly laughable. Let me be clear. I do not expect a typical Hollywood gym cut shaved chest body with tattoos to be the bad guy. I appreciate that some of the toughest guys out there might not necessarily look the part. But on no level did this guy appear a threat to Liam Neeson. 4. WHAT IF - if somehow in the beginning his daughter already had her drivers license and the boyfriend took her in his car, just having fun spending time with her by taking her to the track or a parking lot and was like hey if you pull the handbrake and do this it's fun because then the rear end can get out behind you. TRY! And oh yeah I drive a BMW because it's rear wheel drive and Mercedes are too! bam 40 minutes later. Believability is allowed to happen even though it would still be a stretch!! I've been driving stick since I was 15 and Im 32. I love driving. grew up on gran turismo and love enthusiast driving. I could't drive like that. I even like Maggie Grace and would have loved this kinda direction. She deserved a cool scene. - I didn't even think about that for 5 seconds and came up with a better beginning to the movie that would have served the overall arch so much better. 5. boring. If This was Taken one it would never have made it to the theater. This totally reminds me of watching movies from the 80's or 80's and wondering how in the world it wasn't a straight to DVD release."

","I've read reviews of this film and many have seem to bash it. Good films in my opinion do not have to be perfect, and judging by many of the reviews, they all seem to wanted perfection. Let me start off by saying, no..Taken 2 was not as good as it's predecessor, but T2 delivers the goods when it comes to good ol fashion thrills chills and spills. We all know the story and expect the cliché happy ending, but the enjoyment is the ride getting there and boy what a ride it was. Liam surprised me with how good he was at hand to hand combat. He kicked butt and in the same note, he took a few knocks which made the fighting somewhat more realistic and brutal. Another surprise was Maggie Grace (who plays Kim, the daughter). There's no doubt in my mind that Maggie had a whole helluva lot of fun making this film. Maggie's role in this film will have you saying ""You go girl"". Taken 2 has what it takes (no pun intended) to entertain. So if some of you people out there are looking for perfection, look for it in another film. But if you're looking for a good ol fashion action and suspense...Taken 2 delivers."
"stuartkpark","1","1","2","16 October 2012"," Dull, dull, dull
","Since I wasn't a fan of Taken (the first one) I didn't hold out much hope for this installment, although I'm willing to entertain it as it *may* surprise me (haha).<br/><br/>To recap, Liam's daughter was kidnapped in the first one meaning Liam had to do some bad things to get her back. In this one some folk were annoyed with what Liam did and therefore wanted to return the favour. Yes, it's a straight-up revenge flick. We've seen revenge films many times before, but hey, they might find a different way to tell this story, some different angle or story device, alas no.<br/><br/>One of the main problems with the first one is that the Maggie Grace character is very annoying, meaning I had no interest in her being rescued which negates the whole point of the film. In this one, she is just as annoying, oh well. She was equally annoying in Lost, thankfully she had a fairly early exit from that.<br/><br/>Liam and his wife get taken (I see what they did there) and Maggie actually *helps* to rescue them. The second half is then Liam rescuing the wife who spends all that time being unconscious and groaning.<br/><br/>As action films go it was very by-the-numbers, there was no tension, at no point did we think Liam was in trouble. For me Liam doesn't work as an action hero, he looks like your kind old uncle rather than someone like Mr Willis. I understand that could be the point, but I wasn't convinced. He suits the calm and controlled Jedi character, but he never had a platform in which to shine (thanks George!).<br/><br/>The acting was generally wooden. There was no chemistry between any of the characters especially Liam and Maggie; I was more convinced by the bad guys. The story and way it was told has been done many, many times before. I can't think of a single original idea in here, it felt like a cut-and-paste job, a mish-mash of all the action films from the last ten years, but not even using the good bits. Oh and the ending was boringly predictable - yawn.<br/><br/>There was a line that made me properly laugh out loud: ""Is there a safe place you can throw a grenade?"".<br/><br/>I did read something positive about this film on IMDb: ""According to the film's writer Luc Besson, this will be the only sequel."" What? Please no... http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2446042/ *** Rants *** Spoilers *** Rants *** Spoilers *** Rants *** Spoilers *** Oh dear, oh dear, this film is so full of plot holes and things that make no sense it almost seems they were written in on purpose. I'll rant about them anyway as this is more therapeutic (and cheaper) than counselling: - If you have some prisoners you've spent a great deal of time and money on capturing - watch them! Either someone sit in the room or setup a web cam so you can see what they're up to. Don't leave it to the sleepy guard taking a nap outside the door. This is such an old trope now it's become very irritating.<br/><br/><ul><li>Why were they taken (!) to a holding room? They have their guy, they want him dead - just shoot him.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>If wanting to handcuff someone please use metal handcuff, not threads of cotton.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>We know from the last film Liam killed lots of people, meaning he's probably pretty handy. If you capture your guy - search him for weapons or any communication devices he may have stashed about his person.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>So Liam manages to phone Maggie and have a good old chit-chat for several minutes. Can no one hear him? I guess our sleepy guard is really asleep - bless, must be hard work being a thug and general cannon fodder.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>We hear from the bad guy boss that Liam is to be captured alive. So why in the next scene are the bad guys shooting straight at him? If he's in a car shoot out his tyres or aim for the engine. Unless it's one of those magical exploding cars - then don't.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>When captured and taken (!) to the baddies place he builds a mental map, some of which are sounds. When Liam retraces this mental map some time later we still have the same guy playing the same musical instrument on the same step. The same dogs are barking at the same place. The same guys are welding in the same area. The same guy is singing at the same mosque. What? Really? Come on! - Why did they crash into the US Embassy? What was the point? They could have stopped outside.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>After they crashed would they have let this guy loose again? Would he not have been arrested or at least held for the damage caused, not to mention all the people he'd shot.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Let's say they were happy with him crashing into the embassy and shooting people so released him to rescue the wife.

When you see daughter throwing hand grenades to surrounding buildings to help her father calculating his location, you realize how desperate movie makers were, to have some original ideas in this movie. Of course, nobody searched him, so has cell to call his daugther in the first place. Story line is based on revenge of the families of killed bad guys in Taken 1.

"moellerder","6","1","2","12 October 2012"," Awesome content, but without substance.
","When i sat down in the cinema i knew exactly what i was going in to. I had seen the trailers for Taken 2 several times beforehand, as well as having watched the first movie the night before. So it wasn't to my surprise when the plot revolved around the main characters (Excellently portrayed by Liam Neeson, as always) daughter, and this time also ex- wife, getting kidnapped. This being an interesting concept to return to for the sequel, sadly ends up being a somewhat lackluster experience on some points.<br/><br/>I have two main issues with the movie:<br/><br/>First of all is the main villains motivation. In the first movie the villains son is, and one of many, killed by our main character in his pursuit of his daughter. The movie opens up with a scene, also seen in the trailer, where the villain stands by the graves of his sons and others, securing his folks on how they're going to get their revenge, which is what the movie is all about. The guy just wants revenge, and does so by (suprise) this time kidnapping our main character and his family. This ends up with our hero breaking free as the first, where after most of the movie is about him getting him, his daughter and ex- wife together in one place. It is really hard to believe in the villain of this movie, when his only train of thought is a caveman-like mentality of simple revenge.<br/><br/>And my second issue: There is no real climax, although there is many points where it feels like the movie is leading up to one, but every time without any satisfying outcome, but just more pursuing of his family. It feels like an endless chase decorated with cool moves, fights and car chases. And those the movie do good, nonetheless, but i can't help but feeling that in the end they're pointless.<br/><br/>I left the cinema with some awesome laughs of great fighting and stunt scenes along with some clever James Bond-like tricks. However, it all ends up just feeling like awesome icing on a not as awesome cake. Still a good movie, but not as good as the first at all."
"jaxbubba","7","1","2","12 October 2012"," Gotta Love Liam Neeson
","Kudos to Liam Neeson for single-handedly reviving the action adventure genre. Back in the day, when I was growing up, the action adventure genre was never in short demand due to the holy triad of Willis (Die Hard), Stallone (Rocky / Rambo), and Schwarzenegger (Terminator); however, the mantle of action hero seemed to have been vacated until Mr. Neeson took the reigns and ran with them almost four (4) years ago with hits like Taken, A-Team, The Grey, and Unknown.<br/><br/>Though not as good as it's predecessor, Taken 2 does appease the adrenaline junkie's hunger for high-speed thrills, and off the chain action sequences. In this go around, the human trafficking cartel in which Bryan Mills (Neeson) thwarted in Taken 1; have their sights set on vengeance. It seems that one of the individuals killed in the first film was the cartel kingpin's son, and he is hell bent on exacting revenge on not only Bryan, but also his family (ex-wife and daughter).<br/><br/>The thing that I love about Liam Neesom's characters, especially Bryan Mills, is that they are played so low key, and down to Earth. No one, not even the criminals in his movies that he is engaging, can take him seriously. That is until that can of ""whoop ass"" is opened up. He's just your average, run of the mill ""Joe"", devoted father, and all round nice guy, who possesses enough mercenary skills to kill you with his bare hands if need be. I guess that why so many people going to his films, because Liam Neeson has the knack of making people (you the audience) care about the characters that he is playing; and that goes way beyond Acting 101 class.<br/><br/>Bryan Mills is no exception. I love the Bryan Mills character. Devoted ex-husband, loving father by day; ex-black ops, ex-military, security force provider by night. All Bryan wants to do is make an honest living, and be the best dad that he can be to his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace); who can be very trying at times, but actually grows up a lot in this film.<br/><br/>My one complaint with this film has to be its length. The film is only 86 minutes long, short by any standard. The film takes 21 minutes up front with fluff and fill before any action even begins, and wastes another five (5) minutes at the end, which leaves the audience with about only sixty (60) total minutes of action adventure time and I want MORE!!! I also have to question Bryan's decision to leave his wife's limp body at the scene of the henchmen's abduction site, but hey, he was only doing what the script told him to do LOL!!! Still a very enjoyable film, and I did walk away from this film feeling very satisfied. So I do recommend this film. If action adventure is your genre of choice, then you will not be disappointed. The film references the first film enough so seeing Taken 1 is not a necessity to enjoy Taken 2. The good news is that it seems that a Taken 3 and 4 might come to fruition. With a $49 million debut (twice Taken 1) at the box office, I am sure that 20th Century Fox will not have any issues making this happen either. So it seems that Bryan Mills just might be around for a well, and that's a good thing!!! SEE MORE OF MY REVIEWS ON FB @ ""THE FARIS REEL"""

","Warning: Spoilers<br/><br/>Taken 2 is a predictable, by the numbers sequel which unfortunately plays everything too safe and lacks the excitement of the first movie. What made the first movie work was Bryan Mill's (Liam Neeson) drive to find and recue his daughter from those evil traffickers and it worked because we felt his anger and wanted everyone of those responsible to get dead. Taken 2's villains are out for revenge, it's a continuation from the first story and while look mean they're far less intimidating because they haven't done anything too sinister on-screen for us to see. What this flick needed was a jump-start and to make it work somebody needed to die and they had ample opportunity. Lenore (Famke Janssen) is a stupid character there to be screamed and rescued much like Maggie Grace in the first but her roles been updated here, she plays Neeson's sidekick and does a surprisingly good job but back to Lenore. She was wasted in this movie and offing her would have created an emotional chord which would have made Taken 2 that much more impactful because like the first we would've felt the anguish, we would have felt the anger and we would have wanted everyone responsible to pay but the opportunity after being teased was wasted here and the result is a very average and predictable follow-up to a movie that had merit. The stakes should have been higher, the fight faster and more brutal but somehow it was a generic romp. The kills less exciting, the cutting of the action was questionable and confusing especially the scene with the metal bars what's more and there was absolutely no 'bloody' impact to any of the violence including the very tame climax which felt like it came out of nowhere.

","Taken, the original was good. This sequel however, was not. It may have been the ~3 year gap since I remember seeing Taken, or that the novelty of chasing through streets and missing people has worn off.<br/><br/>This movie produced more laughs in the theater than expected. Keep in mind that it is release day here in NZ. Parts that were not supposed to be funny, were. To keep this as spoiler free as I can, I'll try not to mention them.<br/><br/>The audience was ready to shout out ""PICK UP THE PHONE ALREADY"" when the daughter was Skyping her boyfriend poolside, where Bryan was being captured. But lets go on with the movie, and later we find that the mother is being tortured. The scene was dragged out from a soft case which contained a knife, scissors, needles and all sorts of tools, but nope, just cut the fabric on the shirt, that'll make the audience cringe.<br/><br/>Which brings me to the fight scenes. Not enough blood, and the deaths were rather censored. Me, along with the whole audience laughed when Neeson 'killed' an assailant by 'swiping his elbow over the guy's neck'. Some realism thanks. Also, who goes 1v1 man style when you're trying to save your wife? Cue cliché podium fight, hand to hand combat. I wanted to yell ""Just take the freaking cheap shot, no one cares"".<br/><br/>There was no plot development either, just ""I NEED TO FIND SAVE MY WIFE, DAUGHTER, HELP ME BY DRAWING ATTENTION TO YOURSELF WITH GRENADES"". Characters were not really developed, so Taken 1 fans understood most parts, whereas the person next to me who hadn't seen it had to ask me about it.<br/><br/>All in all, not a great movie, would probably wait for a DVD copy from the local video rental store if you were going to watch it. The 94 minutes was not worth the money."

","When you enter the theater hoping that the film will not disappoint you put great expectations on the film. I knew that many reviews varied in rating Taken II. Thus, I was perplexed by the wide range of opinions there in. <br/><br/>This sequel and supposedly last film in the theme had to live up to the rave reviews of the first and the first run of reviews definitely were varied. After seeing the movie I was more than satisfied by the quality of all aspects of the film. The acting and script were top notch. The characters were realistic and the plot was mostly believable. The talents of Liam came through as was expected. The believability flowed well up to the last 7 or 8 minutes when the final scene turned sour when Liam gave the ringleader an ultimatum that was just too unreasonable after all he'd been through. Thus, a great film with a thud ending."

","If you want to see more of Liam Neeson kicking ass and killing everything in sight then this is the film for you! Although... there are problems... 'Taken 2' isn't as good as 'Taken', it's the same sort of thing just minus the prostitution storyline and the adrenaline rush the first one provided. 'Taken 2' has some very choppy camera work, especially in the fighting scenes. The storyline is also not as strong... but... it's still an enjoyable action flick as Liam Neeson's bad-ass presence makes this film worth watching, without him this film wouldn't be half as enjoyable. I enjoyed more than I thought I would after reading other reviews. 7/10"
"movietelevision","8","2","7","6 October 2012"," In some areas, an improvement on the first
","I always love a sequel done right. No matter how good a movie is, there is always room for improvement, and as much as I loved the original Taken, it's no exception. In Taken 2, it was great to see everything that made the first so re-watchable was there, but there was more added suspense and character development. <br/><br/>While Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) is still working security as opposed to his government position as a ""preventer,"" he has clearly made a name for himself in the business, having been hired for a three-day job in Istanbul. Unfortunately for Bryan, he just can't seem to catch a break when he goes overseas. <br/><br/>One of the fathers of the Albanian men who kidnapped Kim in the original inspires the fathers and brothers of the other kidnappers to enact revenge on Mills. He tracks Mills down, and discovers Mills' ex-wife and daughter, who came to visit Bryan after his job was over, are in driving distance. They set out to find the family, and are able to kidnap Bryan and his ex-wife Lenore. <br/><br/>But come on, we all know Bryan wouldn't lie down and die. He uses a concealed phone to call Kim and is able to enlist her to help in his mission to free himself and Lenore. We really get to see Kim shine in this movie, who we only saw for a minute or two at the very end of the first after she was dragged out from under the bed early on. <br/><br/>The worst thing the filmmakers could've done is a remake the first movie. Thankfully, this wasn't the case. We got to see Mills employ some of his ""particular set of skills"" that he didn't in the first movie, such as being able to follow where he goes with timing and audible reference points, despite being blindfolded in the back of a van filled with vengeful criminals in an unfamiliar area.<br/><br/>This sequel also forgoes repeating the bloodlust Mills goes on in favor of more suspense filled scenes. These were not cheap thrills in the slightest, but rather solid, armrest clenching scenes. And don't worry, there were still plenty of bullets flying from the gun shot by Mills for all those wanting to see Liam Neeson with a firearm in hand again. While it lacks the originality the first had, there's a nice balance of suspense and gun-blazing action. It was great to see the new take the filmmakers had on the story, and to see several of the characters return with even more consideration to their developments. <br/><br/>Like most of you probably are, I was hesitant going in to the movie due to the massively negative reviews. However, I implore you to look past those reviews, and give Taken 2 a chance, especially if you enjoyed the original (which also had a classified ""rotten"" rating on RottenTomatoes.com). I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and I think those who are looking for more of what they saw in the original, but not necessarily the same movie in a different location, will be more than satisfied."
"StevePulaski","3","2","7","6 October 2012"," ""Taken...again?""
","Back in January, Liam Neeson was on his A-game with The Grey, an abstract, stylish, and truly exhilarating picture about survival of the fittest and how to cope with life when you're down to your wit's end. The film has gone on to have sort of a tainted legacy, with some viewers questioning its logic, its realism or lack thereof, or simply the ending, which has left a good or bad impression on many.<br/><br/>It wouldn't surprise me if I learned the same people criticizing the logic and realism of The Grey are the same people who loved Neeson's earlier picture Taken and will be lining up at the multiplex to see this sequel, ominously and ridiculously titled Taken 2 (there's not much else they could've called it, but there are certain titles you don't place a ""2"" after). Both films lack logical points here and there, but the last time I saw a sequel this lax and lazy was The Hangover Part II. Taken 2 is a thrilling roller-coaster you've rode on before; an exercise in rehashing formula that wasn't particularly compelling the first time around. My praise for the first one was minimal, but I admitted that the film offered more exposition and detail than previous action films cared to give their audience.<br/><br/>Yet it would seem the only way Taken 2 knows how to expand on its characters is by flashing back to its predecessor in cheap and choppy fashions. The film opens with a group of men in Albania attending a funeral, mourning the men who ex-CIA operative Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson), killed in efforts to find his kidnapped daughter. Then we cut to present day and learn that Kim is trying to get her driver's license (need I mentioned Kim is played by Maggie Grace, who is twenty-nine and looks absolutely nothing like a teenager?). Bryan is still overprotective, as usual, and decides to book a trip to Istanbul, not far off from Albania, I may add, with his daughter and ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen).<br/><br/>But wouldn't you know it? Not too long after Bryan, Lenore, and Kim arrive in Istanbul, the two parents go out for a drive and are subsequently kidnapped by the same Albanian men we saw mourning their loved ones in the beginning of the film. And wouldn't you know something else? When Bryan is tied up, he manages to call Kim, who is still back at the hotel room, and has her open his enormous briefcase of everything a spy/ex-CIA agent could want, pull out a map, calculate the circumference in several areas, ink spots where he might be located, throw multiple grenades out the hotel window to try and see if her father can hear them, and is able to find out exactly where he is in a matter of twenty cinematic minutes? If you thought the original film was incredulous, this film is light years more far-fetched than its predecessor.<br/><br/>Olivier Megaton's direction is some of the worst I've seen. Almost as bad as Transformers: Dark of the Moon. The fight scenes (and there are a lot of them) are largely jumbled and incoherent, and the scenes of car chases, with vehicles reaching high speeds and bullets flying in every conceivable direction, shots rarely last longer than a second and the camera never remains still. The whole photography is gray and monotonous, and captured under unsteady direction, it's a messy looking endeavor.<br/><br/>Emerging from Taken 2, I had but two questions looming in my head; one, why is Bryan Mills so good at saving his daughter from danger yet so inept when it comes to protecting her from danger in the first place? The other question is, how can twenty-nine year old (ahem, sixteen year old) Kim fail a driver's test yet be able to drive so fluently through the uncertain streets of Istanbul at top speed with bullets flying through her windshield? And don't get me started on the scene where her and Bryan crash through the US Embassy's booth...<br/><br/>Starring: Liam Neeson, Famke Janssen, and Maggie Grace. Directed by: Olivier Megaton."
"rgkarim","7","2","7","5 October 2012"," Less Bite to this action flick
","I've been gone for a while so I apologize to those looking for my reviews. However, I am back with my latest review on Liam Neeson newest film, Taken 2. Surprised to see a sequel from an already great movie? So was I and I was also a little disappointed to hear Hollywood make a sequel of an already complete story. What were my thoughts on this movie? Read on to find out<br/><br/>What is the story for a movie about a girl being kidnapped and an elite operative father going into the underworld to find her? Simple another tale of kidnapping and rescue, with a little vengeance thrown into the mix to help find a justifiable, though cheap, reason for a sequel. Yet the directors decided to throw a ""twist"" into this movie to barely escape robbing us of a good tale and that is the mother and Liam Neeson are kidnapped. Some difference huh?<br/><br/>You might be saying, I go to see these movies for other reasons than a story Robbie, I go to see it for Liam Neeson because he is the man, the action of a fast plot, or in some cases to see a hot girl. Will I get my money's worth if I go for those things? I'm happy to share my opinion on that, starting of course with Liam Neeson. As you might have guess, Neeson once again plays the role of a stoic warrior with a mad set of skills, whose only weakness is a soft spot for his beloved daughter and wife. His ability to transform from a gentleman into a killer still impresses me and the fact that he can say so much with little dialog is a skill I continue to admire. Thus if you're a fan of his previous movies, where he pretty much pays the same character, you are going to love him in this movie again. However, something that was a little fresh in his role was a little humor mixed into his limited dialog. It wasn't the lines that were funny, but more of the delivery of the lines that had me chuckling. His reaction and facial expression as he spoke these awkward lines helped deliver a punch to a rather dry dialog, which may not be what you're going for in this movie, but is worth mentioning. <br/><br/>I suppose I should talk about the action for this movie though, as this series banks its success on adrenaline pumping scenes. Well my friends, you're in luck, this movie still has the qualities that made the first film so memorable. Car chases, gun fights, and some martial arts are all mixed into a heaping combo of high octane action that will have young boys screaming wow, and Neeson fans clapping in their seats. The directing staff did a nice job integrating the physical skills of a special ops agent, a.k.a Neeson beating the crap out of a bunch of terrorists, with the more subtle and calm skills of a tracker. Just like in the first film, fans will most likely be saying Neeson is still a bad @$$ as ever, and shouldn't' be messed with. Unfortunately there are a few flaws to the action. The first is the jumpy camera work that is present throughout this whole movie. While it is not the worst I have seen, many scenes were too jumpy or not filmed in the best manner to catch the most detail. It might have been to bring a little chaos and intensity to the scene, my thoughts were more the camera crew had too much red bull and wanted to make the audience feel the same. On top of that, the action is not as creative/intense as it was in the first film. The urgency and suspense that kept us hooked into the film, was very diluted in this installment and the fact that most of the bad guys were not as sinister, evil, or threatening had me a little disappointed. The result of this new direction is essentially the same action from the first movie, with a little less bite to it.<br/><br/>What else can I say about this movie? Well for one thing the actress who plays Kim named Maggie Grace, is just a pretty as ever. Instead of being the victim who is absent for most of the movie though, she instead has some guts that makes her worthy successor to her father's skills, which could possibly motivate the producers to make Taken 3 I fear. However, the additional screen time means more chances to view her beauty, something I think many male audience members will love. Moving away from Kim though, the movie is a decent length and pace so that the already shallow plot does not become boring. The musical score for this movie is also worth noting, as the orchestra work that plays during his gallant battles helps add that hope inspiring touch that helped pull me into the movie. Unfortunately the ending to the movie was a little bland for me and a little boring to tell the truth. <br/><br/>Taken 2 is a decent sequel for the modern age. Neeson fans will still enjoy seeing him kick bad guy butt, while remaining calm, cool, and best of all not overacting. Without the suspense or urgency of the film though, the movie really lacks a key component to keep fans as in to the action. My scores for this movie are below: Action/Thriller/Suspense: 7.5 Movie Overall: 7.0-7.5 My suggestion wait for Netflix or Redbox before seeing this film, unless you need your fix of Neeson for the month. So until then this is Robbie K signing off and reminding you to enjoy the movies."

"cattjones","7","2","8","5 October 2012"," More of the Same
","I am going to start out by saying that Taken 2 was not as good as Taken, but the film did manage to tie the two together. Not only that but they left it open for yet another sequel. Not sure that is a good idea. There was plenty of action and the basic premise remained the same as the first. The film did demonstrate how small the streets are in Istanbul. Some of the driving scenes were utterly ridiculous and so unbelievable that they left me shaking my head. The fight scenes were well choreographed but by the time you get to the end of the film, they just started getting way too long. As identified in the trailer, once again someone is kidnapped. My question is why? If this film is about revenge, why not just shoot them; but that's just me. I have to say that Liam Neesom (Bryan Mills) is in pretty good shape to take on the physicality of this role. His character is as stoic as ever, however there are moments that you get to see the more tender side of him. I was not used to seeing Famka Janssen (Lenore) in such a vulnerable role. There was a voice in my head yelling, ""get up already.. You're the Phoenix for goodness sake"". I think that she played the role the way it was meant to be played but I am not sure she was the right choice. Maggie Grace (Kim) as Bryan's daughter had the responsibility of delivering some of the pivotal moments in the film. They were just so outlandish that it once again had me shaking my head. Rade Serbedzija (Murad Krasniqi) was the kingpin of a multitude of bad guys. It was difficult to believe that you could run around and do as much damage as he did and not warrant the authorities crashing down on your head. All in all the film did keep my attention, it's just that it was a regurgitation of the first film, so I would expect that if there is another it will be more of the same. I really like Liam as an actor, but I hope that he can put this franchise to rest. I would like to see him branch out a little more like he did in Nell. Is it worth the price of a ticket? I'm not so sure, so I'm leaving it in your hands. I give this film an amber light."
"gina_grace_etel","7","2","8","5 October 2012"," It's great... if you don't take it seriously.
","I think you have to remember why you are watching this film before you slate or rate it. If you are watching for originality, talent and something to remember long after you leave the cinema then you really took a wrong turn entering the screen. If you want non stop action with a bit of dialogue every once in a while you will leave satisfied. And guess what I WAS! The reviews in my opinion were harsh, no one expects it to live up to the unexpected popularity the first one brought but in a day and age where the media has become the most depressing thing ever its nice to have a action packed adrenaline rush that allows you leave reality for a couple of hours.<br/><br/>In my opinion was it better than the first - no way. Is it still worth watching - of course!"

The scandal starts with border check point showed as if it were a gate of a farm while entering Türkiye. Mercedes taxi and Murat 131 police cars is the indicator of unsuccessful technical details. Moreover, almost all women in the film are portrayed in chador, which is a bias towards Türkiye. It is known that the Albanian's sympathy for the Turkish. I am not sure but I think the tattoo of the star and crescent on the Albanian-Muslim man's hand symbolizes the Turkish flag which is showed in many scenes. So, it is scandalous to try to show Türkiye, Turkish Muslims quite different."
"RyanEberhart","10","1","3","10 November 2013"," Almost as good as the first...
","Usually the second movie in a series is not as good as the first, but Taken 2 is almost as good as the first. Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen, who wrote Taken, followed up with a spectacular sequel. Set in Istanbul the families of the men that Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) killed in Paris have come calling for revenge. The tagline on the DVD I have says ""First they took his daughter, now they are coming for him.""<br/><br/>Bryan is working as a body guard in Istanbul and has invited his daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace), and his ex-wife, Lenore (Famke Jensen), to join him as a get away for a few days once his work is complete. The families of the men Bryan killed in Paris are trying to track where Bryan and his family will be... they find him. On the morning of the first full day Kim and Lenore are in Istanbul the men attack, but they only get Bryan and Lenore. Kim had stayed at the hotel to swim in the pool and relax, claiming jet lag.<br/><br/>Just like in Taken there is almost nothing about this movie I don't like. However, in Taken 2 there is a scene where Bryan and Kim are racing through the streets of Istanbul in order to get to the U.S. Embassy. Bryan is yelling at Kim to drive faster. Kim is yelling back that she can't. The thing that I didn't like is that at every turn Kim whines that she ""can't"". But as we see she certainly can.<br/><br/>When you like the whole movie it is difficult to choose which scenes you like and want to talk about. But I'll try.<br/><br/>There is a series of scenes that I like that have to deal with when Bryan and Lenore are taken. Bryan tries to get Lenore to safety by telling her how to get back to the hotel, but that doesn't work and she is captured. Before Bryan finds out that Lenore gets captured he is ambushed and fights about five or six different guys, maybe more. Bryan finds one of the guys guns and points it at one of them threatening to ""blow his brains out"". Another guy then shoots his ""friend"" three times. That is when Lenore is brought to the courtyard and Bryan calls Kim. Bryan tells Kim what is going to happen and what he wants her to do. <br/><br/>The next scene I like is the car chase Bryan and Kim lead through the streets of Istanbul, despite Kim whining most of the time. The aggressiveness that is required to avoid not only the guys trying to kidnap them, but also to avoid the police is pretty cool. At one point during the chase Kim and Bryan are driving through a train yard; they dodge a train but one of the bad guys trucks isn't so lucky. Just after this Kim and Bryan make it to the Embassy, though they have to drive through a hale of gun fire by U.S. Embassy guards. Bryan calls his friend, Sam (Leland Orser), to make sure they are safe.<br/><br/>The final scene I liked is when Bryan goes after the rest of the group who have Lenore. Bryan now knows that the man in charge is the father, Murad Krasniqi (Rade Serbedzija), of the man he electrocuted in Paris. When Bryan and Lenore had been taken earlier that morning, Bryan paid attention to sounds and turns in the road. He followed those sounds and turns until it lead him to the house Lenore was being held in. Once he gets there... all hell breaks loose. Bryan kills every last one of the men in the house and tracks down Murad and another man, who have left the house with Lenore. Bryan tracks them to a bath house. After killing the last man, Bryan decides to leave Murad alive if he would just go home and live the rest of his life caring for his remaining sons. Murad has other plans and still tries to kill Bryan. Bryan shoves Murad's head into a coat-hook which penetrates the base of his skull.<br/><br/>Taken 2 is a great movie, almost as good as the original. Even though I say that sequels are almost never as good as the first and that I gave Taken 10 stars out of 10, I also give Taken 2 10 stars out of 10."

","Taken 2 (2012) <br/><br/>*** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Retired CIA man Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) takes his wife (Famke Janssen) and daughter (Maggie Grace) on a vacation when they come under attack from a father (Rade Serbedzija) whose son was killed by Mills in the first film. TAKEN 2, like many sequels, is a major step down from the first movie and I'd say the main motive here was to make money, which the film did, and while it's not as good as the original I still think there are enough strong elements to make it worth viewing. The biggest is of course Neeson who once again does a very good job with the role of father doing what he can to protect his daughter. I liked how such a strong actor like Neeson can keep that strength even in a ""B"" movie like this one. There's no question that he can be believable during the action scenes but he's also incredibly strong in the more dramatic moments where he's pretty much laying down the law in what he's about to do. Both Grace and Janssen are good in their roles and we even get D.B. Sweeney in a small part. Serbedzija is also extremely good (and fun) in his role as the grieving father seeking revenge. The movie contains some nice tension throughout its final hour and this includes a nice little twist at the end. The one major issue comes from director Olivier Megaton who was simply trying to be way too stylish early on with the quick edits. This is especially true during the sequence where Neeson gets taken as it's nearly impossible to clearly see anything that was going on. I was worried this was going to continue throughout the film but thankfully it didn't. TAKEN 2 isn't a perfect film but I think fans of the first should be entertained by it."

His voice is very expressive.<br/><br/>Also, there are no scenes that are far-fetched or not believable by the standards of the series.

","The outset of the release of this movie has received a lot of hype and sold out session times at the cinema. When I queued to purchase my ticket the line was a mile long and the session time I intended to see was sold out, so I purchased ahead for the next screening an hour later. Firstly, in a nutshell I enjoyed this movie and will encourage others to do the same. Liam Neeson is brilliant as always with his low husky voice perfecting his role without a glitch. Of course the film does not compare to its predecessor but when does a sequel ever do? I thought the city of Istanbul was negatively portrayed and horrible represented, people have told me that the city is beautiful but after seeing the film I would of thought so otherwise. Neeson's escape with the aid of his heroine daughter was a little far fetched. A getaway is never that simple I would of thought. The antagonists were dim-witted idiots and had no idea how to fight and use guns. But above all the cinematography and special effects were excellently fulfilled, but I think the 'Taken' sequel has run its course, a third film would completely exhaust it, in my opinion."

","Taken 2 begins where Taken left off. If you recall in Taken, Kim (Maggie Grace) is kidnapped by Albanian traffickers on a trip to Paris with her friend Amanda. While on the phone with her dad, ex-CIA agent Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) she sees the men break into their apartment and is able to give her father information to help him rescue her. Bryan then goes on a mission to rescue his daughter. By the end of the movie, Kim is safely reunited with her whole family which includes her mother Lenore (Famke Janssen) and her step-father Stuart. At the beginning of Taken 2, Bryan arrives at Lenore's house planning to pick up Kim for her driving lesson, only to find out that Kim is at her boyfriend's and Lenore is divorcing her soon to be ex-husband Stuart. The next day Bryan goes to pick Kim up again and is greeted by a very upset Lenore. Bryan then invites Lenore and Kim to come to Instanbul after he's done working because of Stuart canceling their plans to China. This sparks the possibility of Bryan and Lenore rekindling their relationship which is definitely what Kim is hoping for. After Kim and Lenore surprise Bryan by coming on the trip, he arranges for a family lunch the next day. Kim pretends to have jet lag and sets her parents up for a date. While on the way to the restaurant, Bryan notices that they're being followed. He gives Lenore specific instructions and to get out of the car. He tried to get away from the men following him and ends up also having to escape on foot. As he rounds the corner one of the men is standing holding a gun to Lenore's head. Bryan calls Kim and tells her to hide. He reassured her that they would be in contact again later. Bryan and Lenore are then ""taken"" by who turns out to be the father of one of traffickers he kill in Paris to save his daughter. The father, Murad wants revenge on Bryan for killing his son. It's then up to Kim to help her father escape and then save her mother from Murad and his men. Personally I love all of the character development in this one and that they added what they did about Lenore divorcing her current husband. It gives audiences the hope of Bryan and Lenore rekindling their relationship and the three of them being a family again. This helped the story line by giving Bryan huge intentions on rescuing Lenore. With action packed thrills and intensity that will keep you on the edge of your seat, Taken 2 is not one to disappoint! I would highly recommend it to anyone who loved the first one or action-movie lovers in general."

","OK so I like most people I was very sceptical about a sequel. My first reason was due to the success of the first film. The first film had the element of surprise and disgust at the same time and probably found many teenagers upset when it came to asking their parents if they can go on holiday with their friends to find a big fat no as a response. So how did the sequel do. It was clever action packed and once again showed the leading man at his best. With his family more involved in the film than shown in the first film it had the potential to go wrong. However the intensity of the film was there from start to finish. The characters carried on nicely from the first film and this was not only a great sequel but a great film which could have stood strong even without the success of the first film.

","First of all,if the first hadn't been made, it would be passed as a decent action flick, the story lines weren't too bad and the suspense in some scenes were keeping me on the edge of my seat. Would he die? Would she die/ You would never know. <br/><br/>However, despite the 12A (PG-13 in America) it could have had better action sequences. <br/><br/>The actors performances is to be praised, especially Liam Neeson and Maggie Grace.<br/><br/>To summarise, this movie is an OK action flick, however I would wait for DVD. If you loved the first film. don't get your hopes up. It's good but not as good as the first one."

","""Taken"", in my humble opinion, is a great film. It has everything that I look for in an action thriller. And, as such, it was always going to be hard for ""Taken 2"" to live up to it's predecessor's deserved status. Whilst ""2"" is a good film, it doesn't make the standard as an equally good sequel in this genre (for example, the Bourne trilogy). Positives - it has a good story line - I was always kept interested in what was happening. The fight scenes were well acted out and were believable. There was also more attention paid to the amount of rounds that are able to be loaded into a single clip on the firearm (I won't quote the name in case it breaches any rules!), which I always pick up on.<br/><br/>The one question I am left asking myself is about the embassy scene. Whether his mate, Sam, pulls some strings to stop them being arrested would have been helpful, as this scene just didn't make sense. Driving a taxi through the blockade and then we are left to assume he just gets out and walks away.....<br/><br/>In short, the film is not as ""on the edge of your seat"" as the first, but is still very much worth watching."
"Fields201","8","1","4","5 October 2012"," MFields Review: Taken 2
","I was really excited about just the idea of making Taken 2 that I couldn't wait for some kind of info about the movie. I remember getting a plot synopsis that went like this: ""Bryan Mills and his wife are taken this time and held hostage against a group of guys seeking revenge of the people Bryan killed in the first movie."" I thought this was a joke. Then the trailer came out and it confirmed it. Not only that, I was led to believe Bryan was stupid or something because it was almost like he was trying to get themselves caught. That's what it led to believe.<br/><br/>Finally I saw the movie with my mom and apparently that wasn't the case. He was smart in this movie, thank God, and even his daughter had some action scenes. The whole revenge plot didn't bother me. I thought it was a pretty decent plot line and as long as I see Liam Neeson kick butt, I'm happy.<br/><br/>The set up for the movie was really good. It reminded me of the first film. Bryan Mills is a car washer. I thought that was pretty funny. It establishes his relationship with his ex-wife (who is now separated) and his daughter (who has a boyfriend and trying to get a driver's license). The set up was really good all the way to Istanbul. What's strange, though, and maybe this is just me but the set up felt longer than the action sequences. Also, it felt a little anti-climatic. It came so sudden to me and I really didn't think the film was going to end at that point.<br/><br/>Speaking of the ending, and I will try to be spoiler-free here but there's a touching moment at the end that I was hoping the film producers stuck with... but it didn't happen. An action happened (when I thought it would) and man, it was so touching up to that point. Man!<br/><br/>Taken 2 is a worthy sequel. I loved the first one. I hear they aren't making a third. Even though it's too bad it won't be a trilogy (I mean, they could end it with his daughter's marriage or something) this one is a good conclusion. I just hope this doesn't end Liam Neeson in action flicks. He's awesome at it!"
"jamesthomas7","3","1","4","7 October 2012"," MASSIVE opportunity wasted.
","saw Taken 2 last night and it left me and my mate annoyed to say the least. It was actually pretty ludicrous and there was so many stupid things in this movie it was unreal. Bryan Mills from the first one is gone! He tells his daughter who he knows is going to be taken by the bad guys to go to his room where they will of course look for her and hide in the closet! How many hundreds of times have we seen that. Bryan gets his daughter to let off 3 grenades in the city only checking once for a safe place to do so. Bryan is fooled by the old lets put your wife in view seemingly looking dead for you to drop your guard trick. Bryan and his wife are taken, blindfolded and taken on a journey to a holding place, they even go on a boat but When Bryan contacts his daughter and enlists her help he only ends being a couple of blocks away and his daughter doesn't even go near a boat. The whole thing is terribly frustrating, the drama and tension from the first is gone everything is totally predictable. When the action starts the camera work is bad and it's hard to tell whats going on in the fights whereas in the original you can see all the moves Bryan makes, methodically breaking down his opponent. Even the acting is bad in this, mainly in the moments involving Neeson, Famke Jansen and Maggie Grace, it felt so forced and awkward, no chemistry between them whatsoever. I wanted to love this movie and came away feeling it was just plain bad. The 12 certificate didn't help, no blood, no gore no brutality, Jansen has her neck cut and is hung upside down so the blood will leak out but we don't see a trickle. Man I could go on and on and on, gutted this was such a waste of £9. Neeson looked bored and fed up just as he did promoting it on Jonathan Ross. Wait for DVD rental or even download for nothing and save your cash."

"Dr_Coulardeau","9","1","5","15 October 2012"," Oh Yes this is Europe!
","This film is done for the European public first of all but it should work in the USA with the nostalgia of so many action films and of course Midnight Express. But the main difference with this film is that here we do not know why the Albanians and this American security agent are fighting. Albania was on the border of the war in Kosovo. So we know there is a political problem and stake. Albania was the communist country that had absolutely banned all religious activities and all religious expression. So, what's left to keep the Albanians away from kidnapping young girls and women to feed them in their lucrative prostitution network? Nothing, not even religious beliefs to try to repent, at least five minutes a day. And we just learned Albania is getting ready to join the European Community. Really? Yes, so they say in the media.<br/><br/>Even more surprising is the fact that the action mainly takes place in Turkey, in Istanbul. Turkey wants to join the European Community and the Euro Zone and that's tricky to provide the European public with that totally violent, terroristic and immoral image of Istanbul. Is it trying to ask this question from all Europeans: Are you going to let that country enter the European Community as if they were peaceful and law-abiding? Or is it asking that other question from the Turks: How can you dare to want to enter the European Community when you are not even able to prevent your territory from being used like that by terrorists without any other motivation than their personal vengeance? The film is ambiguous and very obscure as for its political and ideological motivations. It cannot move the Americans who know nothing about these political questions, but it may frankly be disturbing to the European or Turkish public.<br/><br/>But it is a film by Luc Besson. So there are other elements than just this unclear ideological context.<br/><br/>First it is an action film and Luc Besson here uses an extremely rapid tempo with no slowing down except to increase the suspense and to make us fear the worst. The action is also extremely simple in the means it uses. No super technology. The good old simple cars and car chases, then a simple pager, then some simple guns: grenades, hand guns and some assault automatic guns. That's all. All the rest is simple running and tricky inventiveness. Of course the escape through the window and along a narrow cornice on the façade of a hotel has already been used but its simplicity works perfectly well.<br/><br/>Second Luc Besson has to add a child, here a teenage daughter that should be just over sixteen, since she is trying to get her driver's license and she has already failed twice. Her being in any kind of danger is poignant of course, and her mother being captured and used as bait is just as bad. And Luc Besson cannot evade the cliché, but so well done and used, of the father fixation and of that father who saves his daughter first and his wife, at least twice. We remember Léon of course and the little girl he decides to help in her necessary vengeance since all her family has just been executed by some dumb terrorists. That's a syndrome if not a tic or even an idiosyncrasy of Luc Besson's: the father figure that saves the day of a daughter, a mother, a family, a victim of some terroristic gang violence. That gives a touch of empathy.<br/><br/>The end then would not surprise at all and is so typical of Besson again. The daughter is over sixteen and so she is of age. So she has a boyfriend and the father is kind of jealous somewhere, but Besson must be aging since he is able to make the father step back from his protective jealousy concerning his daughter. Charming.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"
"chrisproggram","8","1","5","7 October 2012"," average sequel that deserves more credits then its bashing.....
","Taken2 is pretty average sequel that has more action and less drama, it's way better then ""Colombiana"", better then ""Unknown"" in action and mayhem. The protagonist in this sequel is a bit flat Rade Serbegija is a bit weak , doesn't put much arrogance or sympathy of his lost sons, Lenore is damsel on distress type of character, to weak, she cold have done better even when they torture her, Kim was better this time i her acting that pulls this time on a satisfying grounds.Her character is expanded and shoes her heroine ability in this sequel. this is not like some review have put it down, she punches and kick everyone like Jean Claude Van Damme , and their is nothing like that in this follow up, That is nonsense by the reviewer to pull the ratings down that doesn't deserves. The movie is normal average and a bit better then other similar thematic movies.If i compare it to ""Salt"" i find this one more realistic in tone nothing was exaggerated the car chase was pretty good they could it expended more on bigger road like they did in Transporter series the driving car chase was realistic but of course was performed my a stuntman not KIm. Now to Mr Neeson that deserves credit in this he is human after all not superhero or Martail Arts master that doesn't fall so easily. He is strong ambitions and well organized with the map directing Kim to find the place were both him and wife were locked. This was amazing and it can happen i real world with similar ability and techniques. What inspired me in Taken 2 was the action were well choreographed, they were brutal but not gore, even the first sequel was no gore except few bullets they shown in bodies, well this could be trimmed down and we might improve more in it's underrated release on blue ray, like they did it the same in Taken the first movie. The motivation was a bit lacking , the thrills and spills are all there i liked the ending of this sequel then its predecessor. That shows how two bulldogs fighting furiously to death. They are both on same level to beat their crap out of each, The technique was amazing i've noticed hand combat that is easily recognize Wing Chun Technic Vs Grave Maga. the first long fight with the stick was awesome, because I'm martial arts my self expert, and i know how to appreciate art, even when it is done by second level training. the last technique was even better compared to other movies that have hand close range fighting. This is realistic then the Expendibles 2 Van Dame vs Stallone hand combat not so My Dame uses more legs vs hands. who ever wants to be thrilled and have a good ride should watch this,however id do suggest to Martial Artis to get their blood raising and felt guess bumps need to watch this .THAT IS HOW I FELT IT WAS VERY GOOD Experience ESPETIALLY WITH MIDDLE AGED ACTER HAS DONE AMAZING JOB LERNING THE HAND CLOSE RANGE TECHNIC Of Martial Ars. You will be Knocked out of your seat, as you have been driven have the same effect by the first Taken movie. Don't believe on critics because those people bash movies like this but gives more credits to bullshit drama, boring flicks, that they only want to enjoy not letting the average viewer to make his own decision. I took my mate just to see his reaction he has never seen the first Taken movie, and he gave me 3.5 to 4 start he love it ,and enjoyed is as i did, keep praising with thumbs up. This move is for guys and for for martial art's and people that how to be enjoyed a be thrilled in their seat. It is not for psychopaths critics, that are lazy, fat and sit on office cheers were don't know how to appreciate other part of life level. They think by reading and writing is the substantial goal for life, but i'll tell you they wrong. life is the enjoyment of artistic splendor were nature prevails were ancient practice can bring justice to aggressors and murders. This is brought to public not just to be entertained but to sense and feel the way of the martial artist that can be part of the every day living to give them safety and show preservation. I give easy 3.5 stars out of 5 and 7 out of 10"
"mm-39","6","1","5","6 October 2012"," Not a bad movie but not as good as the original!
","Taken 2 not a bad movie,but not as good as the original. There are some weak points and strong points in the movie! The weak points are hilarious. The young daughter in the movie can throw random grenades in a crowded city without anyone getting hurt! The young daughter who is learning to drive can out-drive the police. There is always an object lose pipe etc to help out the protagonist. The positive parts of the movie are all the characters: good guys bad guys play believable roles. Taken two is well directed, which makes the movie fast paced. The action and fight scenes are comparably good to the Bourne Identity. Bourne is the standard all other action movie are compared too. All in all, Taken two has more positives than negatives. I give Taken 2 a six out of ten."
"mattimelb-three","6","1","5","4 October 2012"," Could have been better but didn't expect too much
","Taken 2 was as expected in the way that it was a B grade action flick. However, the M rating possibly made it bad. We didn't see the carnage that is supposed to be involved with an action movie. This is not because I wanted to see people getting killed. I just wanted to see what was going on! Combatants dropped to the ground for seemingly for no reason because the M rating stops us seeing it. I'm sure M ratings used to allow more than they do now. This looked more like a G rated movie. And the boss fight was ridiculous. Boss fights are of course stupid, but this was worse because the opponent hadn't even been built up to be someone that was up to the main character's skill level. Strange! There were also good parts with this movie: The father daughter cooperation was brilliant. The grenades to work out where he was, loved it! His daughter first of all having driving lessons earlier in the movie and then having to drive around the city like a mad lady later on while they were being pursued, was used well. I would like to say that if you like action movies then you will like this, but I can't say that because the action was semi-deleted for the lower rating. At least that's how it appears. Bummer! Oh well, still had some interesting parts."

The storyline and acting was fine but the action was just horrible. Im surprised the movie wasn't rated G for violence. I wish this movie could be redone. Maybe they will make taken 3 to redeem the 2nd. Hey its been done Oceans 12 was bad and Oceans 13 was good. Bourne Supremacy OK Bourne Ultimatum awesome. Rocky 5 bad Rocky 6 OK.

OK , one more, Liam got lucky , the bad guys took their time to slowly start to kill his wife , so slow , that it finally didn't happen. they just teased her with scissors all the while.no hurry.very convenient for Liam to arrive in time. </li></ul><br/><br/>anyway , i loved every second of the movie , BRAVO , great sequel. (but lets be honest the first one was indeed a tiny little better because it was new , and now you just know it , that he will fix the job and all will be OK and save ) hey of course his family is not gonna die. the film producer should do a taken 3 , i will go see it .

","Paris was a no go. Istanbul was next! Eventually, Bryan Mills will end European tourism. Any successful film just cannot be left alone these days. Sequels, prequels and remakes must be made in order to capitalise on the monetary gains of a surprise hit. ""Taken 2: Taking your Money"". Yet, in doing so, the excellence of the original is tarnished. Ding ding! We have a prime example of that here. Whilst the story actually has purpose and could've made for a decent sequel, Megaton unfortunately turns it into a nauseous nightmarish holiday. Mega time! The Mills clan journey out to Istanbul where they encounter the family members of the sex traffickers who Bryan killed back in Paris.<br/><br/>A semi-realistic revenge driven plot that is conversely driven by unrealistic methods that left me doubting Bryan's legitimacy. Being hunted down within the sprawling streets and bizarres of Istanbul? Exciting. Driving recklessly (without a licence!) smashing into cars and public property without any consequences from policing forces? Encouraging 'Grand Theft Auto' silliness. However, what really tickles my custard cream biscuit, is the ""innovative"" use of grenades. Listen. I'm all for finding new ways to locate someone's whereabouts. But throwing grenades in the middle of the bloody day out of a hotel window is not the way to do so. Forget about the eye-rolling ""Kim, me and your mother are about to be taken"" phone call. There's enough explosive nonsense in those grenades to start an international conflict!<br/><br/>Although you may not make it to that point with Megaton switching the camera angle between every spoken word. Seriously! It's headache inducing. Neeson, whilst not as dominating unlike in the original, still gives a commanding fun performance. Grace's character gains a much welcomed mature performance, but Janssen does nothing more than play the one-dimensional damsel in distress role. Once the shenanigans cease, they all enjoy ice cream at a gloriously sunny beach to the pounding beat of Alex Clare's ""Too Close"". Pretty much sums up this film!"

I thought: ""wait, he didn't kill all the bad guys? Who's getting taken this time?""

Most of the acting was subpar, even Liam Neeson's acting was recycled from the first movie. The soundtrack sucks, and also the sets/locations are boring. One of the biggest issues in this ""movie"" is the editing during the action and fight scenes. What a joke! How many camera angles and cuts do they need? Film Making 101: just because a scene is filmed with ten cameras does not mean you have to include an angle shot from every single camera! The editor(s) need to be fired ASAP, and never be allowed in an editing room ever again! What if someone in the audience is epileptic and has a seizure? Heck, even a regular person may get a seizure watching the fight scenes! This ""movie"" has some of the worst editing I've ever seen.

1. At first the villain cut the throat of Lenore. She is bleeding as hanged down but after that next few scenes we see her without a cut and she is fine. How?
2. Villain ties Bryan with loosely and leaves his phone in his socks without checking it.
3. Bryan traces her through various voices which he heard & learned in first blind journey. It is a good idea. But in real it is not necessary to same voice is playing on all time, like a man playing violin or dog is barking etc.
4. When he enters house all guards have their faces towards the house side instead of the gate. What is guarding!
5. Villains are vanishing as their serial order like tailor made order as main villan at last, second villain at second last turn etc.
Overall movie looks like not a good thriller. First half was very slow. It should be fast as required by such thriller.
My suggestion is if you saw 'Taken' then not necessary to see 'Taken 2'. There is nothing new and thrilling here. Watch only if you have no other choice."

","After reviewing other reviews I am left thinking what do I see and enjoy on this movie, Taken 2 that is the first of the series I have seen. <br/><br/>I thought it was great and like any movie the location is never spot on, and that's what makes it even more enjoyable and fun to watch.<br/><br/>I thought Liam Neeson and Kim did a fantastic job. Well done. <br/><br/>Now I want to see taken 1 and hope there might be further movies.<br/><br/>I'm not sure what others see to say it was nothing but a comical movie filled with laughter.<br/><br/>I also think the goofs adds to the movie and it makes it much better for a first time viewer.<br/><br/>It's a movie I would highly recommend for many. And I know many who don't have their drivers license that would drive automatic, who hop right in and know how to drive a stick shift more than anything.<br/><br/>Love the ending where their having Sundaes and Jamie joins them. <br/><br/>It was a movie filled with lots of action; heck when it gains my attention as people try to text and chat with me on facebook it must be good.<br/><br/>When's the next one coming out?"

","Taken 2 picks up the story sometime after the events of the original film. Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) has mended the fences with his family and things are looking up. So much so that they all decide to vacation together in Istanbul. Unfortunately Bryan still has plenty of enemies left and once again he's forced to wage one man war against terrorists, kidnappers and all around scum.<br/><br/>Taken 2 is a decent action film. Neeson gives once again a very good performance as an aged special agent turned security expert, who's perhaps a bit slower than he used to be, but that doesn't mean that he isn't one of the most lethal people still alive. These movies are really nothing more than an ode to his badassery. And there's nothing wrong with that. Sometimes it's simply enough to watch a guy wade through hordes of bad guys, effortlessly dropping them down.<br/><br/>What bothers this film is the similarity of its plot to the first one. I do appreciate the fact that the events of the original film have a significant impact on the events of this one, but they still could have come up with a plot that isn't simply the plot of the first one in a different location. Sure, it's a good, efficient and working plot and as a standalone film this is a very good action romp, but it's nevertheless a very lazy choice.<br/><br/>So yeah, Taken 2 is nowhere near as good as its predecessor, but it's definitely worth a watch if you liked the original or are simply looking for a thrilling action film that knows how to entertain."

","Pierre Morel's Taken (2008), a tough, disturbingly xenophobic thriller in which Liam Neeson's grizzled former CIA operative Bryan Mills took down a gang of sleazy criminals in Paris, was hilariously bad. But, in its defence, it was at least hilarious, etching Mills and his 'particular set of skills' into action lore. Taken was a surprise box-office success, igniting the recent wave of codgers- dealing-out-some-old-school-brutality films which the likes of Denzel Washington, Kevin Costner and Sean Penn have embraced to varying success, and proving that audiences still have a thirst for that kind of thing.<br/><br/>So inevitably came the sequel, and the producers cannot be blamed for trying to squeeze their new franchise for every penny it's worth before the genre naturally reverts back to straight-to-DVD. What they, as well as the writers and director (franchise-newcomer Olivier Megaton - no, not the infamous Decepticon, though he may have done a better job), can be blamed for, is for putting the audience through the same exact experience again, only without the originality (I use that term loosely) or a coherent action scene. There's plenty of running, punching, kicking, shooting, stabbing etc., but Megaton is so busy waving his camera around and cutting every second that we are left relatively clueless about what is going on, or who anybody is.<br/><br/>Not that this matters - unless it's Mills, his ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen) or his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) - then they're toast, especially if they have thick stubble and are wearing a leather jacket. A gang of Turkish mobsters led by Murad (go-to Eurosleaze Rade Serbedzija) vow vengeance for their brothers and sons who died at the hands of Mills during the events of the first film. After completing a routine security operation in Istanbul, Mills is joined by his ex- wife and daughter for some family time. Only, Mills and Lenore are 'taken', leaving Kim alone to locate her father so he can do what he does best and unleash his special skills on the scumbags.<br/><br/>Simply recycling what came before is unforgivable in itself, but going about it in such bland, formulaic and increasingly ridiculous ways make the experience even more torturous. The movie has one simple message - America good, the rest of the world bad. L.A. is shot in glorious sunshine amongst the safety of middle-to-upper class suburbia, while Istanbul consists of dingy alleyways and overweight men puffing cigarettes in cockroach-infested rooms. This casual xenophobia may have waved somewhat if the film delivered any thrills at all, but it doesn't, and fizzles out with a weak climax. Neeson somehow manages to come away from it all unscathed again (and with his wallet no doubt heavier), but his ability to make lines such as ""when a dog has a bone, the last thing you want to do is try and take it from him,"" sound like Oscar-bait does not save Taken 2 from complete disaster."

","I thought the first Taken was a good film and I was surprised at how good this sequel was. A person could say that it was odd there was a film starring Liam Neeson called A Walk Among the Tombstones that seemed to be another film director plagiarizing the Taken films and using Liam Neeson to help achieve that objective. The sequel to Taken was-at least to me-a very watchable movie. I have heard it criticized for having yet another batch of Eastern European crooks in it but it really isn't another batch-its the same ones from the first movie-and after killing so many in the first movie it stands to reason they would be out for revenge in the sequel. It made plot sense to me.Maybe it could be criticized for being a bit formulaic but I think that is sometimes how the world is-things flow along a relatively predictable track so maybe its not so formulaic after all. All in all-it was good fun to watch with all kinds of chases and fights which is why makes these films entertain and are not philosophy classes. Looking for Franz Kafka-its not here-but thats what makes it fun to watch."

","Taken 2, the sequel to the massive 2009 hit Taken, is an average sequel that's still entertaining and quite interesting. Compared to the first film, it's a step-down. Sometimes the plot felt a bit forced and it feels similar to the first film. Frankly, the writing is not the best either. But it's still feasible entertainment thanks to the charm and charisma of Liam Neeson, lots of good action, and some gorgeous location shots in places like Istanbul.<br/><br/>Olivier Megaton's film has ex-CIA Bryan Mills returning in this sequel. After he invites his daughter and ex-wife to come with him to Istanbul, things go south when family of the victims he killed in the first film seek retribution.<br/><br/>I can't complain about Liam Neeson returning because as always, he knows how to kick butt. he's a bona fide action star and for someone his age, he is very spry. I wouldn't say Maggie Grace is the best actress but despite some annoying whining in the film, she does okay. Famke Janssen has a bigger role in the film and I think she does a good job.<br/><br/>Overall, Taken 2 is not better than the original but it does it's job in entertaining the audience, or I should say me since not many people were thrilled with the film. Despite some flaws, it's a solid action film and nothing more than that. I rate this film 8/10."

I do feel that Liam Neeson is undefeatable in any way possible, and therefore you know he isn't in any REAL danger, but because of this it gives for great fight sequences. I am glad that they didn't completely destroy the name of Taken, even though it was slightly weak in the sense that escaping or defeating enemies was easier than it should be. <br/><br/>Understandably, I know why audiences may be angry or let down because it matches nowhere near the class or capability of its potential.

","Taken was like a rare dish served in a respective restaurant cooked by a prestigious chef. You enjoyed it a lot and there were few complaints but, it was so good that you overlooked the minor flaws. The dish went down to your stomach where digestive juices started attacking it to break down the delicious dish for nutrients. The dish then travelled through your small intestines where it's further broken down to individual molecules and absorbed directly to your blood stream. Taken 2 on the other hand is the remains of that dish pushed up and around the large intestines and exiting from your anus.<br/><br/>I was excited to see Liam Neeson return to his kickass dad role and do what he did so suavely and almost nonchalantly in the first movie: take no names and kick some unknown gang member's ass. However, this movie had me greatly disappointed. The movie tried its very best; it had a great premise in that the family of the gangsters from the first movie comes to Istanbul to take revenge on Bryan Mills (Neeson) for killing fathers, husbands, brothers and sons. But sadly that's the furthest the movie went with this great plot point. The antagonists were very generic, they were horribly unoriginal, and were Muslims which I'm assuming made it easy for us to hate.<br/><br/>This wasn't a huge issue in the first movie where the antagonist were also Muslim, but the movie didn't take every moment to remind us that. It hinted it, and I respected it for that. It was just happened to be a gang of Albanian kidnapers and that's all they had to say. Rest was just history. Liam Neeson kicked some ass, shot and tortured some goons, and I was a happy camper. Taken 2 on the other hand wanted us to know that these guys are maleficent and they are Muslims and the good American hero is out there fighting on their turf to defend his family. I would have over looked this, if only the movie was even remotely as good as the first one. The antagonists seem smart at the beginning of the movie but they quickly became your generic brand hired thugs that can't shoot, and do everything haphazardly. They were very easy to kill and showed very little to no intelligence. Just a side note; why in God's name the Albanian gangsters in Turkey talking to each other in English? It boggled my mind how stupid this movie got at points.<br/><br/>The fight scenes were absolutely horrendous, and were grossly edited. There wasn't a single sequence of continuous fighting. The camera was shaky and you would only get to see a bit of a fight scene because of heavy editing. Apparently they didn't have a good enough budget to hire a fight coordinator but they had enough money to hire a stunt driver to show off amazing driving skills through the narrow streets of Istanbul of a girl who failed her driver's test twice.<br/><br/>Liam it seems was trying his best, but the movie was so bad that only his performance from Schindler's list would be able to save this pile of excrement. His co-stars didn't really shine either. That's all I have to say about it. Any further details are irrelevant because it so bad I have nothing to say. Their acting was just awful. Both the wife and daughter played by Famke Jenssen and Maggie Grace, were just there as an eyesore. They didn't really add anything to the movie they didn't provide any added excitement, and it was a good reason to only show them for first few minutes of the first movie.<br/><br/>This movie would have been so much better if the bad guys had some depth, if it had some decent fight scenes and much less screen time for the leading ladies. I say don't waste your time go watch The Raid Redemption instead."
"acker-chri","3","0","1","23 September 2013"," Taken 2 Mediocre?
","Olivier Megaton's Taken 2 puts the action back in an Action movie. He delivers extraordinary thrills with his impassioned fight scenes for an overall ""adrenaline pumping"" movie. Sounds familiar, doesn't it? Taken 2 takes us familiarly back four years prior to its prequel , Taken, whereas the title implies, Bryan Mills' (Liam Neeson) daughter, Kim, is taken by Albanian sex traffickers. Taken 2's mirror like plot line does this with a slight (possibly original?) twist. Unlike its prequel, instead of Bryan finding Kim, Kim frees Bryan who then frees Lenny (mother). Even with great rebuke of the film's originality and predictable scenes, It can postulated that Megaton would be elated to know that somehow the fight scenes were still enjoyable and even did a good job of emitting the emotions that Bryan was feeling, to the audience.<br/><br/>Bryan, Kim and Lenny seem to pick up right where they left off from the prequel. Bryan is still a tough old man that you wouldn't want to mess with and is still divorced with his ex-wife, Lenny, who is again having relationship issues. While their daughter, Kim, is trying not to fail her driver's test for a third time while also, to her father's dislike, managing her first boyfriend. From this point on it's almost as if you watched the original taken, but with a few discrepancies here and there. The setting takes place in Istanbul, Turkey, where Bryan recently finished his three day body guarding job. In result of Lenny's current relationship problems, Bryan decides to invite both his daughter and ex-wife to a vacation with him. But guess whose back? No not Slim Shady, but Bryan's old acquaintance, Murad. He is back with great vengeance for the killing of his beloved son in the first movie. Murad realizes he has a great opportunity to get Bryan's whole family instead of just him. After Bryan catches onto what is occurring, the movie takes a four year trip back in time and picks up an oh so familiar plot. This is also when the predictable aspect of the movie kicks in and vaguely follows as so: some fighting, Bryan kicks some butt, slight disruption, along with some more foreseeable fighting.<br/><br/>One thing that an action movie can't go wrong with is fighting, along with the most important feature, more fighting. Although the movie is almost identical to its prequel, it is surprising how engaging the predictable combat scenes are. This is likely due to Bryan's bound and determined personality that he shows. He will take on three, even four men at once and always come out on top. Not only is this cool but it might leave the audience wishing their fathers were as ""bad ass"" as Bryan. Along with being engaged, it is refreshing how the character's emotions are oozed onto the audience during certain scenes in the movie. A specific scene that portrays this is when Murad shows a picture of his son that was killed by Bryan and tells Bryan how it is his fault that his son is dead. Now if you have seen the original Taken you know that Murad's son wouldn't be dead if they wouldn't have taken Bryan's Daughter. During this scene it is hard to express any emotions but anger, and will feed your hatred of Murad. This newfound hatred with the assistance of the ""bad ass"" mentality Bryan portrays is the only thing that will keep this movie from being a bust. <br/><br/>To conclude this substandard movie, not only is the plot fast-moving and the originality lacking, but because of this, it also made the movie boring because of how predictable it was. Yet somehow, is it reasonable to say that Megaton still came out with a mediocre movie?"

Will it be able to recreate the magic?<br/><br/>At least Famke Janssen gets a much meatier part in the sequel. I have been watching her in Hemlock grove, and she deserves more time on the screen. She is a good actress.<br/><br/>The first film was much more believable. Neeson may have played an expert, but he really stretched it in the sequel."

","When i watched first movie, i was very amusing and waited for the second one impatiently. But second movie was a mess. First of all there are some logic mistake in the film. Because the girl cannot drive the car very well, but somehow she managed to drive the car between the Istanbul street which the most difficult street even for the best drivers for my opinion. And another mistake in the film is Turkish life that is reflected in the film. Because, every women you see in the film has a sheet on their everywhere. I have never seen so many closed women in my life in Turkey and police cars are really comedy :) Film productor wants to show Turkey very back minded but I can say it is not like in the film. Please try to be more realistic when you present a country."
"spicelady67","7","0","1","25 March 2013"," fast action, serious family issues yet humor at times
","I enjoyed this DVD from my local library. I like Liam Neesen. Since I had not seen the original Taken movie my only knowledge of the movie was in the brief trailers around the Academy Awards time. The scenes over the roof tops reminded me of some of my son's video games a few years ago. The triangulation of location by cell phone signal, counting turns, smoke, and wind direction is somewhat a ""leap of faith"". The speed of the scenes led me to accept the locating of the family members rather than thinking too hard. There is a good underlying story of family cohesiveness or sometimes lack thereof. The funniest line was his asking Kim if ""she could shoot"".I also wondered as another reviewer how she could on demand drive a stick shift so well with speed. Use of GPS was funny too in the fast action scenes."

","This film is a waste of space. Unbelievable and despite Neeson's claim that you don't need to have seen the first one (I haven't - and won't after watching this piece of crap), you really need to have seen the first one to have any idea what it's about. Do yourself a favour and don't bother watching this rubbish unless the only alternative is to kill yourself.<br/><br/>Seriously, it starts poorly, gets a bit unbelievable then tapers off towards the end. Liam Neeson (an overrated actor in my opinion) was clearly just in this for the money as it has no artistic merit whatsoever and doesn't even entertain... maybe that's unfair as twelve year olds might enjoy it."
"WhiteTrash86","Null","0","1","16 February 2013"," My take on Taken
","Many cases of American tourists, women,captured and sold into prostitution.They are being used as sex slaves!!!!I personally saw 6-7 cases in my short stay in Spain-under 2 weeks.6 months have passed since I last time saw them so I don't know if there is anyone of them alive anymore.One was being held captive in a shelter for homeless people(""Albergue"" they're called in Spain),near the docks of Barcelona).Another in a homeless shelter again,this time in Madrid(name of that shelter is San Isidro).Again,one in Barcelona,taken from the beach of Barcelona,by at least two males and one female).The girl who was taken,she was tall,blonde,curled long hair,wore a black dress,she kinda looked like that singer,Samantha James.Another case is somewhere in a neighborhood at the edge of Barcelona,where there are mountains,and a tall strange building.That girl,she refused to sleep with them at first,but one of them kicked her in the chest very hard.This is the case with all of them,they are beaten too.Another case,this time a Canadian female,a young girl,was taken by force at 5 am in the morning,near Barcelona's ""Nord"" bus station for intercity travel.She wanted to find her way to the airportin fact,and was asking around inside the park near the bus station.She didn't know that she was asking the wrong people(almost all of them are wrong)and those Albanians took her by force at gunpoint to their car and drove off,never to be seen again.She owned an apartment in Barcelona from what I've heard,and she came to Spain regularly to visit.She had some friends there as well.The night before,she had a fight with her Spanish friend(a she) and decided to go back to Canada,so she was asking for the way to the airport,and then this occurred.I saw a lot more cases like these in Madrid,besides the ""San Isidro"" case.Many of the people who do these things are:Romanians,Albanians,Arabic(Morrocans),some Spanish too,Portugueseetc.I have one more case to relate to you in much more detail.This is about an American girl who was a captive outside Madrid,50 KM away,somewhere in the wilderness,in a ""pueblo""(small camp, village)named ""Gesmo Alto"".This is located on the highway between Madrid and Valencia,50 km outside of Madrid, past the small town Chinchon,you take a road somewhere to the right on the highway,a dirt road,and you drive some 500 meters and you find a sign which says(or used to say) ""Gesmo Alto"".It's not the first villa,but the 2nd villa in which she was a captive,the one with the big black metal doors, electric doors, owned by a Portuguese man named ""Hannibal"".His friends(Romanian, Spanish, Arabic) used to visit him on a regular basis and they always had a chat during night, in front of the villa but they never came out during day time.I was working for a man named Albaro there, right across their villa.By the way, the man that took the American girl prisoner in ""San Isidro"" homeless shelter in Madrid is also a Romanian(tall, fat, wearing a small beard).He is from Bucharest originally.He is the one who took her to that place and also the one who locked her in one of the dorms and intimidated her in order to make her become docile and be used as a sex slave in that place.But they all participate in that:the staff that runs the place and the residents.One of them has AIDS!!!!One day,I was walking around in the building, hoping to find the room she is being held captive in, and at the first floor of the building(all doors are locked during daytime and people are told to go walk around in the courtyard or outside) I heard several bangs in one of the doors, but wasn't sure what door exactly and I didn't have the guts to investigate further. I was also hearing death threats from the Romanian in his own native tongue(""I will kill him"", ""Il omor""), because he knew from one of the residents that I was on to something, some guy in a wheelchair saw me walking around and quickly entered his room and warned the others.So,now to get back to that ""Gesmo Alto"" case, in the Spanish wilderness.I was working for this man Albaro,collecting cardboard and selling it to recycling,and other menial and laborious things.I had been staying at his house for several days now,2-3days.I knew what was going on from their conversations during night time. I also knew there was a Romanian girl inside as well, like the American, held captive.The Romanian screamed a lot, but the American stood quiet all the time, she had strength, and dignity.She knew there wasn't a reason for screaming for help..cuz no one can hear you anyway,but God.During the third night at Albaro's house,one of the men who was a Muslim among the others, asked one of the women of that house(Hannibal's wife I think) to go inside the villa and ask the American girl if she believes in allah or not.The woman went inside the villa to the room where the girl was and asked her if she believes in allah and she answered that no, she doesn't believe in allah,she believes in Jesus Christ only!The woman returned outside and told them her answer.One of the muslims there took out his gun immediately and went into the villa and shot the American girl three times.The sound of the shots dissipated into the cold air of the night..she was dead.There was nothing I could have done.I knew she was dead and laid upon the bed,in my shack,shocked.After a few minutes they take her body,put it into the trunk of one of their cars,and one of Hannibal's friends, or maybe himself,I am not sure,drove somewhere in the wilderness nearby to bury it.The Romanian captive, seeing what has been done to her American friend,started to scream:""I want to die too!"""

","I absolutely loved the first film and was concerned that they were just throwing together a money-grab with this sequel. The trailers all made it look like it was the exact same movie all over again. That couldn't have been further from the truth. Sure, it had a similar feel in terms of cinematic elements and action style but the plot was completely different and yet it tied into the first movie really well. I can't give the film a perfect rating because it felt like it lacked the same unique experience that made the first one so special. That's probably not fair but it's the truth nonetheless. I noticed that a lot of people disliked or were disappointed by this movie for some reason. That reason escapes me because I thoroughly enjoyed it and would think that anyone who loved the first movie would enjoy this movie too. While it doesn't quite match the first one, give it a shot... you won't be disappointed."
"nickmesafilms","3","0","1","11 January 2013"," Taken 2 (2012) - Liam Neeson, Why?
","Talk about ""taking"" away your money! Right from the get-go, a sequel to ""Taken"", a high-paced entertaining action flick that made Liam Neeson a household name, didn't seem like the best idea ever. No one was asking for this, but sadly, this movie got made, and I wish that the filmmakers backed out of this project from the start because ""Taken 2"" was one of the very worst movies of 2012. Liam Neeson reprises his role as retired CIA operative Bryan Mills, who invites his ex-wife and daughter to join him for a holiday in Istanbul, where Bryan and his ex-wife are suddenly taken hostage by relatives, friends, and close family members of the men that Bryan had killed, trying to rescue his kidnapped daughter in the original ""Taken"". Now, he's less treated like a hero, and now leaves it to his daughter to get him free...really? Everything that went right in the original ""Taken"", went incredibly wrong here. This sequel lost the fun, excitement, care, respect, and realism that the first film had. Everything feels way too staged, and even though this is one of those movies where you have to suspend your disbelief, I couldn't help but keep track of the many times I wanted to scream out ""bullcrap"", finding myself unintentionally laughing at the many unrealistic scenarios portrayed here. But all my main problems with this movie, the top reasons why this mess failed from the start, are all story-based! *SPOILER ALERT* The main villain is probably the weakest antagonist in any movie in 2012. This guy just walks around aimlessly, making tons of death threats, and yet he's quite too lazy to get his hands dirty and do it himself, but asks his henchman to do the nasty work for him. Also, if you're going to kidnap someone, no henchman has ever decided to leave their victim in a small room, with nobody either watching or guarding the captive, while the other group of henchmen are in the room next door watching soccer on TV. But, to make things even worse, while Bryan tells his daughter what to do over the phone, he tells her to do the most mindless thing that a human being would never do, by throwing grenades off a roof. Those idiots are probably going to kill someone walking down the street. WTF! Directed by Olivier Megaton, this is one of the most poorly filmed action movies I've ever seen. He clearly has no idea how to film a decent action scene. The shaky cam gives the film a hideous look, and the audience is left wondering what the heck is happening. The writing is horrendous, the editing is annoying, there's barely any sound quality, even the actors are really trying. Long story short, I just don't want to talk about this movie anymore. ""Taken 2"" is one of the worst movies of this or any other year. It should be found, and then killed. ""Taken 2"", in my review, ""pointless, unnecessary, insulting, and godly indulgent""."

","I actually feel like I wasted and hour and a half of my life. Taken 2 has let me down.<br/><br/>The first reason is the screenplay. The cameras switched off people too quickly. Yes, I understand they tried to make it a fast-paced movie, but you really could not keep up.<br/><br/>The second reason is the plot. Why is it that there weren't any ""I can't believe that happened"" type scenes where it just blew you away? They all sort of got taken throughout the movie, but it was only for a short period of time.<br/><br/>The only applause I give to this terrible movie was somewhat of the creativity. When they showed Liam Neeson tracing his steps and listening to the sounds around him and calculating the turns, that was pretty cool. Also where he told his daughter how to coordinate that back to him.<br/><br/>Bottom line: I wish they could have done better and this is nothing compared to what Taken 1 was. Don't buy it on DVD because honestly it is a money waster."

","He stood up against the Nazis, he trained batman, he is the father of all gods and men, he leads the A Team, he is a guardian of Narnia and a JEDI, why on earth would you seek to trouble his family? <br/><br/>This is a good movie. It is entertaining, it is thrilling, there is a decent level of suspense and it has Liam Neeson. A good plot that compliments the first movie and if you are entertained by movie number 1 you will for sure enjoy movie number 2.<br/><br/>Making sequels to great movies is risky business than safe. TAKEN was a massive hit back in 2008 since it was the first of its kind. Surprisingly TAKEN 2 are good and entertaining almost as its predecessor. Personally it is my strong belief that the change in the director too is a beneficial move towards its limited success since the styles vary in direction and this reduces the similarities if the movies are compared. However one cannot deny that it is a parody of TAKEN but still it greatly is a better sequel than HANGOVER 2. As it always has been with motion pictures, sequels work much well on action movies than comedy or Horror genres.<br/><br/>The 60 year old mega Hollywood star is the obvious reason that the TAKEN duology (it's a madeup word) is the hit action movie that it is. Who are we speaking of? Liam Neeson of course (If you did take a moment to answer that you could be one of those that saw no sense in the plot of Taken!). Oscar Nominee Liam Neeson effortlessly carries a massive one man showdown of entertainment this time as well. What I like about Liam Neeson is that he is the Steven Segal (apart from the voice) of today. Whilst not a Martial Arts expert, he indeed is calm and masculinly (made it up too) graceful. Is he not a versatile actor? <br/><br/>Also the inclusion Maggie Grace once again is a nice touch along with Famke Jansenne (XMEN). If there is one thing great about this movie is that Kim gets to play a larger role and she assists in changing the entire formula of TAKEN 2 reducing the resemblance to movie number 01! Maggie Grace delivers adequately and of course is tom boyishly beautiful. Like father like daughter is what I kept muttering to myself as her character matured through the minutes of the action. She is someone indeed to look forward to in the year 2013. She is talented and beautiful sadly the same cannot be said about Nicki Minaj!!!!! (Nope she is not in the movie)<br/><br/>As much as I am a fan of Mr. Neeson TAKEN gives us an overdose of Neeson with Maggie Grace reducing the concentrate at timely intervals. It does feel that the screenplay is not boldly written since it has large shoes to fill with the 2008 movie. Therefore it is entirely entwined on Neeson that the villains are almost nonexistent. While director Olivier Megaton draws interest to the idea of reprisal, the villains are so droopily written that none of them are given names! In my opinion this results in a lower rating than what the movie has potential for if the screenplay is fearless.<br/><br/>I would watch this movie again without hesitation so you should at least watch it once.<br/><br/>Happy New Year Folks!<br/><br/>TITLE: TAKEN 2 DIRECTED BY: OLIVIER MEGATON STARRING: LIAM NEESON, MAGGIE GRACE, FAMKE JANSENNE AND RADE SERBEDZIJA RATED: PG13 RATING: 6.5/10 RUNTIME: 92 MINUTES"

Liam Neeson and his wife get caught, and this time it's his daughter that has to save him. Thanks to the character resource-fullness she can save them. But yeah when he is free, it's all his game then. He kills them at ease. At the end he gives the old man a chance to stop this vendetta and he leaves his gun, the old man is only after revenge and grabs the gun and shoots. Then Liam Neeson turns around and shows the bullet that lacks in the gun then he kills him with his palms. Awesome scene.

I thought the movie was too violent, but I'm thinking that about a lot of movies lately.<br/><br/>OK, this movie included a cool chicken run on a train. And it had a chase on the very same Istanbul rooftops they showed in Skyfall and about a dozen other movies. Every filmmaker loves that location.<br/><br/>If you love Istanbul, you'll enjoy the backdrops in this movie. Istanbul itself is a fabulous city. However, this movie made it look like the whole city revolves around the Grand Bazaar and Hagia Sofia. And are there really so many women wearing burqas in Istanbul?? The exposition and character development at the start went on for too long -- and it didn't really work.

","Frankly, I had very high expectations of the sequel. When I went in to watch the movie, I expected a lot of hi-tension action. But, the movie seriously lacked the same. Liam Neeson reprises his role as a retired intelligence agent taking out people who come after him seeking revenge. He excels in the scenes showing affection &/ concern towards his daughter and (ex) wife. That's it. I expected a lot more from Neeson in terms of action but there is nothing much. This time around, he teams up with his daughter to rescue his (ex) wife from the captors. Overall, Liam Neeson's part could have been supplanted with more action scenes (with additional scenarios &/ stunts thrown around). But, I have to admit that this guy still rocks at age 60!.<br/><br/>I also felt that the Screen Play was crisp and fast moving. But, that's the only credit apart from Neeson in the film. The director could have done a lot better with more action scenes and scenarios and frankly, there is not much as such. Cinematography is above good and places in Istanbul (Turkey) have been picturized well. I understand that Turkey is a democratic and secular country but most of the background consisted only of mosques and veiled women.

"Robert_duder","6","0","1","18 October 2012"," Surprised at how good it looked, but under-delivers and gives you what you'd expect
","Taken was simply an awesome action flick. It sort of catapulted Liam Neeson into macho action star hall of fame. When I heard about Taken 2, I sort of groaned (although I am all for sequels to great movies) but I didn't expect much when I heard of it. However, then the trailers changed my mind. It actually looked like a solid sequel, great action scenes and a decent, if not understandably predictable, storyline. What the film actually delivered was sort of more of what I anticipated before I saw the trailers. It was truly, absolutely and apologetically delivered to make money on the first one. The story was nearly as smart, the action was actually significantly toned down and, while there are always plot holes and reality issues with action films, this one had a lot. The nit pickers will find a million things in the film to complain or laugh at. Some of the plot holes are significant and hard to ignore. However, Liam Neeson's on screen chemistry is also hard to ignore and he carries the picture as he often does. There are some undeniably cool car chases although I feel like I've seen too many European, tight street, car chases.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson is good as mysterious likely former-Government killer Bryan Mills. I hoped to get more back story on his character but we get more of the same as we did in the first one. Neeson didn't seem quite as committed to his character in the second outing and his skill set didn't feel quite as impressive but he was good. I don't dislike Famke Janssen but she's never really impressed me. I found her annoying and over-dramatic in this movie. Her and Neeson's chemistry doesn't feel quite right but at the same time I'm glad she came back for the sequel. It gave the story a different direction than the first. I really thought Maggie Grace did a good job though. She had excellent father-daughter chemistry with Neeson and she plays a good damsel in distress type role even though she wasn't really the one in danger this time around. Rade Serbedzija looks the part for a great villain. Unfortunately, I felt like he was completely underused and there was no great buildup to a showdown with him. He seemed almost bored in his scenes and his vengeance quest felt so downplayed.<br/><br/>I might be harping on the cast and I shouldn't be because they all do okay...but just okay. I wanted more action, more drama, and more back story on these characters. They had so much untapped mystery to the character of Bryan Mills and they answered no questions whatsoever about his obviously shady past. Simply put they didn't put real effort into the script for the film. French director Olivier Megaton seems to often leave gaps in his films. At least the others I have seen like Columbiana and Transporter 3...it felt like they could have been so much more but not enough effort was put into the story. Taken 2 delivers a lot of potential but never really delivers anything solid. The buildup to showdown with the villains culminates in Neeson fist fighting some random third string character who apparently is super powered and nearly defeats him. The main villains death scene (huge spoiler here) ends with Neeson grabbing his face and shoving him against the wall...which kills him. It was just really a sub part delivery. If you loved Taken, which I did, then you will likely enjoy Taken 2 but you won't love it. Its really a huge step down from the ideas they had. Its simply sub part all around. 6/10"

","""Taken"" is a fun movie. It introduced Liam Neeson as an action hero and it shed light on one of Europe's bleakest and most disturbing crimes. ""Taken"" also presented itself as a stand-alone movie that did not leave any evidence or room for a sequel. If another Taken were to be made, it would either be a simple rendition of the previous film or something completely different. ""Taken 2"" fulfills the former.<br/><br/>Following the events of the first film, a father of one of the Albanian traffickers that Bryan Mills (Neeson) tortured and killed seeks vengeance upon him. On vacation with his ex-wife (Famke Jansen) and daughter (Maggie Grace), the Albanians strike—kidnapping Mills and his ex. For the rest of the movie, it becomes a deadly game as Mills fights to save his family from the Albanians. The story is pretty straightforward and as the audience, we anticipate the outcome. However, we still enjoy the ride as the hero takes on 20 or so bad guys. <br/><br/>There are some things that are better in this Taken. For one, there is a solid villain, played well by Croatian actor Rade Serbedzija. He is known in Hollywood as portraying evil Russians and he is up on his game in this movie. Even so, he seems to have more leeway in his performance than any other role I have watched him in—for his character requires a bit more on an emotional level. He is not entirely bad nor is he good; he simply wants to avenge is family, which is understandable. Maggie Grace is given much more screen time and pulls off well as a brave heroine in the face of impending peril and death. There are also some thoroughly entertaining action sequences that seem to dwarf the original—one particular sequence has Mills and his daughter zooming through Istanbul in a taxi, all the while being pursued by police cars and baddies; narrowly missing death on multiple occasions and wreaking havoc on a city wide scale. <br/><br/>""Taken 2"" certainly fulfills the entertainment department, yet it is not as fun as the original. This maybe because the first film is a one of a kind in the action/revenge genre. In my opinion, it is due to Neeson's performance. He was so intense, passionate and meticulous in the first film, that we rooted for him to slaughter the bad guys. Though the same character in ""Taken 2,"" he is not as much of a driving force. He seemed a bit distant and a little too complacent, as if he was acting at arms length rather than immersing himself into his character. For me, this is a downer. <br/><br/>Director Olivier Megaton runs into the issue of overdoing the hand-held camera. While this can be tastefully done, the videography was a bit a dizzy in most of the hand-to-hand fight scenes. This may have been done to maintain a PG-13 rating and hide Neeson's stunt double, but for an action junkie like myself, it ruins the fun. I like to see gritty fights and not have to be left in a haze of wondering who is getting their face punched or neck broken. <br/><br/>""Taken 2"" is not all bad nor is it up there with the original. In all honesty, they should have left Bryan Mills alone."

","'TAKEN 2': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>The now iconic Liam Neeson returns to the role that made him an action star in this sequel to the 2008 surprise hit. The film is once again produced and co-written by action master Luc Besson. It's also co-written by Besson's usual writing partner Robert Mark Kamen (who also co-wrote the original). It was directed this time around by Olivier Megaton, who also directed the Besson and Kamen scripted action films 'TRANSPORTER 3' and 'COLOMBIANA'. Maggie Grace, Famke Janssen, Leland Orser and Jon Gries reprise their roles from the first film and Rade Serbedzija joins the cast as the movie's main villain. If you liked the first film and just enjoy watching Liam Neeson kick some major ass you should enjoy this sequel but it has absolutely nothing fresh or new to offer.<br/><br/>Neeson reprises his role as Bryan Mills, the unstoppable CIA badass. This time he's on assignment in Istanbul and has invited his ex-wife Lenore (Janssen) and daughter Kim (Grace) along with him. Just as Kim is starting a relationship with a young man (Luke Grimes), Bryan is suspicious of, Lenore is now having relationship troubles with her second husband. The trip gives Bryan a chance to rekindle his lost romance with his ex-wife, much to the delight of his daughter. Bad guys of course have to interrupt things though. The family of the men Bryan killed in the first film (while rescuing his kidnapped daughter) now want revenge and have tracked Mills to Istanbul. They're lead by Murad Krasniqi (Serbedzija), who especially wants revenge for the death of his son (who Mills electrocuted to death in the original film). They kidnap Bryan and Lenore but Bryan is able to warn his daughter in time for her to flee her captors. Kim then aids in the rescue of her parents this time around, by following the advice of her knowledgeable father.<br/><br/>The movie is extremely fast paced and the bulk of it's action takes place over a matter of hours. The action is stylishly directed and exhilarating with Neeson once again showing what a cool badass he can be. Neeson has reached legendary status in film now and rivals any Hollywood tough guy (even at age 60). Janssen and Grace are beautiful but no acting is really required and Grace is getting way too old to play the sweet young daughter role. The movie, like all of Besson's films, is weak on dialogue and cheesy when it's mellow but when the action is roaring it's one hell of a ride. Nothing new or original at all but about what you'd expect from a routine sequel with the number 2 in the title.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xh674mS5vTo"

","I can't believe to my eyes when i watch the movie. As an Istanbul citizen, all the things about Istanbul and Turks you gonna see in this movie are absolutely wrong. All the women in the movie wear at least scarf or the black dress which is not true. Turkey is a secular country and people where scarf are few over the population. Also you can't blow freely grenades in anywhere in Turkey. Or come and try it and wait what will gonna happen. And do not expect to see these old police cars which we use to have 30 years ago. Moreover, the place they use for American embassy is a palace or a museum (i guess it because you cannot see it properly) in reality. And when you go to real one there is no American soldier nor police at the door. And lots misinformation which i cant count in here. Obviously, this film is trying to give the message that we get used to: Turkish people and Muslims are the creatures who always have black hair, paunchy, mustache or beard ugly people. And their job is to terrorizing the environment and raping women. And small reminder to director: We don't have borders with Albania and if we have be sure that it will not like as in the movie. Anyway if you wanna see the real Istanbul come and see with your eyes. Please don't listen and believe what you see in this kind of movies because they are up to something!"

","Taken 2, a generic action/revenge thriller, is a ridiculously contrived sequel that exists solely due to the fact that the first installment unexpectedly made potloads of money at the box office. The first movie's kidnapping scenario is repeated, exception being that it's Neeson & his ex-wife Janssen who are captured this time around. Their daughter, Grace, then follows laughably specific (& complex) instructions from her father in order to help her parents escape. Shot in Istanbul, the gorgeous city is done a great disservice by showing only the dark back alleys & the grime & clutter instead of the more tourist friendly parts that could have added so much more allure. Every actor goes through the motions half-heartedly. The only thing to recommend are the occasionally diverting action sequences which, though reasonably well done, are reminiscent of (but inferior to) similar sequences in the very entertaining Bourne films. Makes the first film look like a masterpiece!"

","Taken 2 is another example of a greedy producer who wants to milk the success of the first movie, knows that there should not be a sequel and tries to maximize profits by hiring dumb writers who have never been outside US.<br/><br/>I have been to Istambul and it has almost nothing to do what we saw in the movie. OK, the Bosphorus and the mosques are there and that's it. People don't behave that way and the movie is full of flaws which makes it look like a comedy.<br/><br/>In one of the scenes, father and daughter are in a boat and he starts telling her that the waterway separates Europe and Asia and it has been used for more than 2500 years, blah blah. And she asks how he knows all of that. The answer, which is probably the same as the source of the research writers and director did for this movie, was that he read it in a guide book in the plane on the way there.<br/><br/>Anyway, the flaws have been pointed by several other reviews but what most annoyed me was the lack of depth in the scenes and characters. What happened to the realism of the first movie?<br/><br/>When the girl started detonating grenades on the rooftops of the most touristic area of Istambul so her father could accurately say how far she was from where he was being held captive, a lot of people in the theater started laughing.<br/><br/>Save your money, and wait for the DVD in case you are really curious about it."

","A friend of mine thought Taken was the greatest movie of all time. I didn't have the heart to tell him that I thought much of it was too unbelievable to be taken as a serious film. Yeah, if you are looking for revenge, then, these films will feed that need. The formula is pretty much set. However, you can still make a good film that is based on revenge. It doesn't have to be formulaic. If you want to see such a film, watch the original Straw Dogs with Dustin Hoffman. The problem is that at some point, you can only push this revenge thing so far, then the film becomes a parody of itself. Taken 2 is much like Rambo 4 in this regard. In Rambo 4, Stallone basically wipes out the entire Burmese army on his own. In Taken 2, Liam Neeson basically wipes out the entire Albanian mafia on his own. He never misses a shot and despite being shot at with machine guns on many occasion, is not even scratched. His teenage daughter, who cannot pass a driving test, suddenly drives through Istanbul in a way that would make Jason Statham's Transporter character look like a fat lady on an electric shopping cart. The same sedentary girl performs athletic feats that approach world record standards. I don't know why people say this is unbelievable.<br/><br/>But nothing I say here is going to change anything. My friend will still think this is a great movie. I can see Taken 3 on the horizon and, unbelievable as it may seem, I think I already know how it ends."

"neil-476","7","0","2","10 October 2012"," OK, but not as good as its predecessor
","Four years ago, Brian Mills (Liam Neeson) rescued his kidnapped daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) from sex slavery by virtue of slaughtering vast numbers of Albanian human traffickers in the unexpected (and now somewhat iconic) hit Taken. Now it seems that the patriarch of the deceased Balkan hordes is of a mind to apply some retribution to Brian by seizing him, Kim, and (ex-)wife Lenore (Famke Janssen) prior to killing them horribly in reverse order.<br/><br/>This no more than a fairly minor variation on the first movie. That doesn't mean it isn't entertaining, of course, but it does mean it's not very original. One of the things I loved about the original is that, while Brian was very focused on his love for his daughter, in many respects he was not a very nice man: there was no room for gentlemanliness in his quest for Kim. Not a believer in human rights, he was brutal in his treatment of those who would seek to profit from the sale of his daughter. While Taken 2 is violent, I get the feel that the edge has been taken off in order to widen the certification (the first film appeared on DVD in a less stringent cut than that which visited cinemas). Also, Brian's position as kidnappee puts him on the defensive for a goodly chunk of the film, when he should be the active protagonist (although he is far from helpless). And there is nothing which comes close to Brian's wonderful telephone speech in the first film.<br/><br/>For all that, this is a tolerable action thriller, but it doesn't come close to the first film."
"caiged","6","0","1","9 October 2012"," Good Action, poor story makes this an unnecessary sequel
","There are certain movies that do not require sequels: Cars 2, Wrath of the Titans, Shrek 2. Taken 2 should safely be added to that list.<br/><br/>It's not a terrible movie- had it been a standalone story it would have done very well. But there are so many repetitions that makes it seem as though you're watching a different version of Taken 1, from the chirpy intro, to being abducted and the subsequent actions scenes. Close your eyes as you watch Taken you, visualize Taken 1 in your mind, and you can virtually map the entire movie without opening your eyes.<br/><br/>The action deserves the plaudits as it's choreographed very well. Luc Besson is a veteran of car action stunts and there are some thrilling moments. But it's ruined by the repetitive and predictive story.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson looked bored as he lumbers his way through the movie. He should as he's done the same thing in Taken 1. This time he and his ex-wife, Leonora, are taken and he has to get loose, and beat up all the goons standing between him and freedom. Along the way he has to save his daughter, again! Seems as though she didn't suffer enough in the first movie. The main villain has a poor excuse for attacking Neesom, which looks even more pathetic when Neeson counters with a very valid reason for causing the villain so much anguish.<br/><br/>Maggie Grace has more of presence in this movie and while it's great for girl power that she has a more action oriented role, it really requires a superhuman effort to accept that her character, who can't even pass a road test in USA in an automatic car to boot, somehow becomes an ace stick shift driving hotshot in the crowded streets of Istanbul. More than Neesom kicking everyone's ass I found this quite absurd.<br/><br/>I really hope that this is the end of Taken. As Neeson's character states in the movie ""I'm tired of this."" I echo that sentiment loudly.<br/><br/>The bottom line is that it is disappointing so much money was spent to essentially make the same film again. If you're looking to satisfy your action thirst before Skyfall comes out this won't be the worst thing to go watch. Just don't pay full price for it."

","Feeling listless in a lackluster season for cinema-goers, I simply yearn for the smell of the multiplex and it had been almost one month since my last visit, so TAKEN 2 has been singled out in view of that I had a mildly positive viewing from its first one (TAKEN 2008, 7/10), and action-packed thriller will at least not be a bore (a sad truth is that here is so difficult to find non-dubbed animation features, otherwise the selection would be much wider).<br/><br/>Being an emblematic sequel relying on the same gambit and stunts to pass through its running time, TAKEN 2 can hardly be called satisfactory, thanks to the rapid editing and effective camera rotation (another tact being overdone here), the gawky Liam Neeson still can render a patina of a sleek special agent, all his moves are pertinent and deadly fatal, nevertheless, reaching 60-year-old, perhaps his next invitation (apart from TAKEN 3, according to its groundbreaking first weekend bravura, a sequel is undoubtedly on the slate now) will be sent from Stallion's THE EXPENDABLES tawdries, and one thing is for sure, he will not be the oldest. Maggie Grace and Famke Jansen both have earned more screen-time, but hardly have any decent time to be composed enough to deliver some jolly one-liners. <br/><br/>The plain storyline has efficaciously implemented the genre fun in the most predictable manner (also an over-simplified one), for example, the special knacks (throwing the grenades among the shacks, counting the seconds to remember the route of the vehicle while being blindfolded) required to locate the whereabouts are too far-fetched since Istanbul is not a remote village and most of the time, the whole scheme is made deliberately to facilitate the film to justify itself, screenwriters (Besson is implicated) simply don't care much to the details and the suspense has never been concocted absorbingly, no matter how many Albanian villains are mercilessly iced by our hero, himself, his ex-wife and daughter's safety has never been severely endangered, so supposedly all the pleasure should be derived from the unnecessary killing of the ferocious but mostly marginalized Albanian avengers, what's the point then?<br/><br/>Director Olivier Megaton is an action genre journeyman (COLOMBIANA, 2011; TRANSPORTER 3, 2008, 4/10), but this time it's Luc Besson who has short-changed his followers afresh, and forebodingly this is not the last time."
"JSilk1993","5","0","2","9 October 2012"," My Review - Taken 2
","It's usually a bad idea to go into a film with the intent of reviewing it when you already have a set idea of how bad it's going to be. Much to my surprise though, Taken 2 was not as disappointing as people have made it out to be although it isn't as strong as the first one.<br/><br/>Firstly, there are some moments that stand out. Liam Neeson seems to make the most with what he's given - he is funny when he needs to be and a bad ass 110% of the time. He certainly doesn't show his age and makes himself out to be one of the stronger actors out there. Throw him into some fast paced action and he really shines through as an intimidating, intelligent figure.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, those are the films strongest points. The film itself offers nothing new and is very easy to predict the outcome of - especially if you've seen the first Taken. There is also an absurd amount of shake in the camera during action sequences to the point where I couldn't quite tell what was going on during fights and shoot outs. My other fairly big gripe is that the film does not seem anything like the first other than it involves people being taken and Liam Neeson finding them. You may think that this is what made the previous film successful but it's not. The reason I enjoyed the last film was the chase and the hunt of bad guys by bad ass Liam Neeson.<br/><br/>Overall the film was fun but I won't remember it in a few days. I look forward to seeing Liam Neeson in more films though as his career seems steady. I don't look forward to more shaky camera action and generic plots though.<br/><br/>6/10"

"The_Film_Cricket","Null","0","1","8 October 2012"," Slightly better than the original maybe because it doesn't try as hard.
","Bryan Mills, the hero at the center of ""Taken 2"", is apparently the most brilliant man in the history of espionage. He can triangulate his location over the phone, guiding his daughter who is using a map and a shoestring, all while handcuffed to a pipe in a basement (more on that later). He can kill 30 bad guys without getting shirt dirty, and still muster enough strength to run 5 miles and kill another twenty. So where are his master-class instincts when it comes to keeping his family from being kidnapped? This is the second now. Maybe he missed a class somewhere.<br/><br/>The original ""Taken"" grafted the serious real-life issue of human trafficking onto a Jason Bourne-style action picture. It made for an odd mixture that never really came together. ""Taken 2"" is slightly better maybe because it doesn't try as hard. It is a revenge thriller and that's about it. It isn't a bad film. What it does, it does very well. It's the kind of thriller that Chuck Norris use to make, only with ninjas as the bad guys instead of Albanians. Weighing the evens with the odds, ninjas make better villains.<br/><br/>""Taken 2"" has a plot that is so simple and uncluttered that is isn't even necessary to have seen the original. The first film took place in Paris and had Bryan (Liam Neeson) killing thugs in order to retrieve his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) who had been kidnapped and sold to a prostitution ring. Mills, an intelligence agent, killed 40 people before the end credits. In that film, he was presented as an assassin who can wipe out a room full of men armed with machine guns and never break a sweat. Here we learn that he can sit blindfolded in the backseat of a car and tell where the driver is going by listening to the the sounds in the immediate area and counting the seconds ticking away on his watch. It's a neat trick, he must have Jedi reflexes.<br/><br/>As the sequel opens we see the bodies of Mills' enemies being loaded onto a cargo plane and shipped back to Albania. Front and center at t the funeral is Murad Krasniqi (Rade erbedija), father of one of the men that Mills murdered. He has strong connections and he wants Mills and his family to pay, and is willing to forgive the fact that his dead son was involved in human trafficking.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, we catch up with Bryan who is snooping around after daughter Kim who has a new boyfriend and has twice failed her driver's test - no points for guessing that she'll be called upon later to do the driving in a car chase. We also catch up with his ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen) one of those Movie Wives who is so good-hearted and so beautiful that she can look gorgeous even after being beaten unconscious. Fortunately for Bryan, she is having relationship problems with her new husband. She and Bryan make eyes at one another proving that a spark still exists. With that, Bryan suggests that she and Kim come on vacation with him in Istanbul where he will be working as bodyguard to a sheik.<br/><br/>Murad determines to find out where the Mills family is staying, so he makes a bribe here, a threat there, and eventually gets the location. Soon his goon squad is converging on the hotel. The chief difference between the first ""Taken"" and the second is that Kim isn't the one who gets kidnapped. This time it is the parents who are taken. In a scene way too complicated for its own good, Bryan – handcuffed to a pipe in an undisclosed basement – makes a call to Kim – still in the hotel - and has her draw lines on a map so he can calculate his own location. How does he pinpoint the location? He has her toss a hand grenade at the parking deck across the street from the hotel. Escaping from the hotel in the mêlée, she is required to throw more grenades as she gets closer to his prison basement. To our amazement, she manages to reach him without the grenades causing an international incident. It is possible that Kim throws enough WMD's to qualify as an international terrorist. This movie isn't that observant.<br/><br/>This is not a movie where logic is the primary goal. The goal is to entertain us with chases and shoot-outs. Some scenes work, others don't. The director Olivier Megaton (that's a real name) knows how to create suspense, but he's not as good creating action scenes. That's too bad because they make up most of the movie. These scenes come in three varieties: car chases, gun fights and hand-to-hand combat. In all three cases the action is shot in a jump-cut rapid-fire style so that we can't get a clear sense of what is happening. Liam Neeson faces a bad guy, they tangle and then we are treated to a series of shots, each lasting about two seconds or less. There is no skill to the fighting, just a lot of confused editing.<br/><br/>What makes up for the bad action scenes is a moderately good performance by Liam Neeson. Neeson, whose career seems to have slipped from great film work like ""Schindler's List"", ""Gangs of New York"" and ""Kinsey"" into recent bone-head action pictures like ""The Grey"", ""The A-Team"", ""Clash of the Titans"" and ""Battleship"" is at the service of a movie that requires him to simply look concerned when not beating the snot out of someone. To be fair, no one knows how to look concerned quite like Liam Neeson. Now in his 60's, he has the kind of strong, laconic, world-weary presence that Robert Mitchum had – that's high praise. It says something of his talent that he hasn't lost his skills as an actor even when the material is less than he deserves.<br/><br/>**1/2 (of four)"

","One of the genuine pleasures of the 2008 film ""Taken"" was seeing Liam Neeson tracking down some of the most despicable sickos in recent movie history. It was exciting to see a character we really liked disposing of villains we really hated. The villains in ""Taken"" were not made out to be charismatic, empathetic, or even particularly smart. They were not given enormous background or one half of the movie's screen-time; we saw just enough of them to pick them out of the crowd, identify what their motives were, and demand that they get their comeuppance. Call me morbid, but I personally do not like the idea of serial killers spending the rest of their lives watching television, pumping iron, and lying around on the tax payers' expense. The sequel to ""Taken"" recaptures a good deal of that excitement, and it further reminds us that there are people like this in the world—and not only in Albania.<br/><br/>The setting is now Istanbul, where Mr. Neeson, once again the retired CIA agent wanting to reconcile with his teenage daughter (Maggie Grace) and ex-wife (Famke Janssen), is vacationing. Although it is curious that they would choose to spend their vacation time in the same general part of the world where Miss Grace was kidnapped, pumped full of drugs, and nearly sold into prostitution in the first movie. When I first heard the rough plot line of this sequel, I cringed. I was not keen on the idea of a revenge story: the father of one of the villains from the first film is seeking revenge for his son's death. I was fearful of getting too much back-story, too many meanwhile-in-the-city moments, and the easy tendency of making a villain into some kind of superhuman mastermind. While there is too much back-story (the opening prologue could have easily been removed for better effect), the filmmakers do a general good job at keeping these guys from center stage. I like that these guys are not represented as geniuses with impeccable systems: they are unstructured, they make mistakes, they let their obsessions get the better of their judgment. And I like how, just as we'd imagine people like this in real life are, they do not particularly care about their comrades, just as long as they get what they want in the end. We usually just see them when they come into contact with Mr. Neeson, which means, of course, fist fights and shootouts.<br/><br/>The action sequences are, for the most part, very good. I will grant that I am getting a little tired of the hand-to-hand combat where we get split-second cuts and extreme close-ups of fists striking stomachs, but the ones here are satisfying. One thing I also liked, and this goes back to storytelling techniques, is that when Mr. Neeson encounters a villain who is nearly his equal, it is a man we have never seen before. A lesser movie would have given this villain a lot of beforehand screen-time, beefed him up, given him a lot of ridiculous dialogue. By having him appear out of the blue and surprise Mr. Neeson—and the audience—it's much more interesting. And it's more suspenseful as to who is going to come out on top. ""Taken 2"" features one of the most brilliant and viscerally exciting car chases that I have seen in a long, long while. In this excellent moment, the director chooses to avoid the tendencies: he pulls back on his camera a bit, gives us some fantastic wide shots as the cars skid across the streets of Istanbul, and the edits are not quite so rapid. The scene is so exciting that I was willing to forgive the fact that Mr. Neeson and Miss Grace were apparently in a self-repairing taxi cab, as it seemed to come through every collision and gunshot without a scratch. That is until some Turkish soldiers fired upon it with a machine gun. Go figure.<br/><br/>Satisfied as I am with ""Taken 2,"" I do have some reservations I must take note of. First of all, why couldn't this movie have had a little more of the heart of the first film? At one point, Maggie Grave even plays super-soldier herself, climbing rooftops and jumping off balconies without hesitation. Funny for somebody who's afraid to take her driving test. Secondly, again, why we should she or anybody from this family even think if returning to Europe after what happened before? And I must admit, I did give out a chuckle when the police of Istanbul were able to ignore three grenades going off in the middle of their city, destroying a parking lot and two rooftops, but immediately appeared when a couple of pistol shots rang out in an alleyway. And finally, in regarding the main villain: the father seeking revenge. Why did the dead son have to be the one that Mr. Neeson tortured the most in the first movie? It would have been more effective—and plausible—had the dead son been one of the unspecified men killed in the first film. Surely there were other revenge-seekers related to guys other than the one who was strapped down to a chair and electrocuted.<br/><br/>I was auspicious about this movie when I first heard about it. Immediately, I was afraid that Liam Neeson's second movie of 2012 was also going to flop for me. I do still wish the movie had had a little more heart, wised up its own mind—i.e. dealing with those grenades in the city and the slow-responding police a little better—and thrown out the divorced-couple-reconciliation subplot. On the whole, however, ""Taken 2"" is a more than satisfying action movie. I think Mr. Neeson's been redeemed. I can now easily forget the utter dud that was ""The Grey."""

","This sequel simply doesn't have the pizazz or impact of the original. Honestly, there's nothing extraordinary on display but despite a host of implausibility's, at least they didn't go too far over-the-top like other sequels to tend to do when following up a beloved action adventure film. (Example: Die Hard 2) If they are going to miss, I'm glad they didn't miss with silly cartoon action. The story sets up fine and I appreciated the extra exposition and look in to the character's lives. It certainly does respect the first films. In fact, it feels like Taken 1.5 as a toned down extension or extended cut footage version from the first film. A lot of the time, those cut footage scenes are cut for a reason. Worthy but not great."
"schapman74","7","0","4","6 October 2012"," The deck was stacked against it
","Developing a worthy sequel to a solid action movie such as the original Taken was never going to be an easy task, if just because of how high the bar had already been set. By that reckoning, Taken 2 has faced an uphill battle from day one.<br/><br/>That said, while I was hoping I'd be able to say it's just as good, sadly that's not the case. Liam Neeson as Bryan Mills still has what it takes, no doubt about that, but Taken 2's plot never really gets off the ground. It's all a little simplistic, not to mention a tad short, and there are a few moments where you find common sense having to take a back seat.<br/><br/>It's not necessarily a bad movie though, by any stretch, and there's still much here to satisfy Liam Neeson fans. The problem is that comparisons between it and the first Taken are inevitable, and even though Taken 2 could have been much worse, it's only ever going to be seen as that disappointing sequel."
