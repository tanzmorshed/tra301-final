"MR_Heraclius","7","48","57","23 February 2020"," Delivers the action... Awesome plot!
","I found this thriller to be enjoyable. Lots of action - some of it pretty unbelievable - and some twists in the story. Very well acted on all parts. I really like Jolie much more in these action movies than the dramas she does."
"MarkusOctavius","8","53","67","29 January 2011"," Good action, good story. Bad image of Russians.
","Just watched the BlueRay of this movie and I really liked it. Good action, exceptional acting, good story. Not a mind blowing, but still interesting.<br/><br/>I've also listened to the director's commentary for the movie where he said that the Russian people had a negative reaction after watching this movie. In particular, that they were offended of the way Russians are shown in the movie. Well, I hope the director reads the reviews on this website and I would like to make a tiny remark. He completely missed the point of why they were offended.<br/><br/>It was not due to the fact that Russian government had (or has) spies in the US, but due to the image he gave to the Russians in his film.<br/><br/>1. Russians don't address each other as ""comrade"". Never did. 2. Russians don't drink vodka on every other occasion. And certainly don't carry a bottle on their person just in case. In fact, Russians drink more beer than vodka. 3. Russians don't kiss each other as a form of greeting. Only if they are very good friends (or would like to seem so) or relatives and either both girls, or of opposite sex. Russian men never kiss each other, even if they are best friends or relatives. Male relatives kissing is much more common in Europe and even US, than in Russia. 4. The Russian spies that were caught in the US last year were not observing the life of US. Any simple person can do that without being a spy. For example, I often talk to my relatives in Russia and tell them how I live in the US and how life in the US is in general. Of course, I don't tell or know any secrets; THAT is the spy's job.<br/><br/>Also, just a side note to others, who might only know about Russia by films such as this one: Russian people don't dream of attacking US (or any other country for that matter). They have problems of their own. So please, stop exploiting these beaten-to-death stereotypes in the movies. Otherwise, the cold war will never really end.<br/><br/>Other than that -- great movie. Enjoyed it very much.<br/><br/>Just to clarify: I am Russian and lived in Russia for 26 years."

","Many reviewers here have stated that this movie isn't realistic because 'Salt doesn't get bruised enough' or 'no one her size could...' Have these people ever been to an action movie before? NO ACTION MOVIE IS REALISTIC. They are all written to be over-the-top because that's what makes them entertaining. We suspend disbelief to enter the world of the action-hero (or heroine) and we go along for the thrilling ride that is sometimes so over-the-top it's ridiculous! But that's what makes it fun. If action movies were realistic, they would be slow and boring. This movie does not cross the line anymore than any other action movie.<br/><br/>Salt delivers exactly what is promised -- a solid 100 minutes of action. It keeps you watching, it keeps you guessing (even when it turns out you were right in some cases), and it entertains from start to finish. If you like the action movie genre, chances are you will enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>As for the reviewers who criticized the way Russians are portrayed, the action genre plays to comic book-like caricatures. The villains are no more realistic than the heroine! This isn't a documentary! <br/><br/>If you like action movies, give Salt a go. Angelina won't disappoint."
"EmilyMoulder","Null","58","81","19 December 2010"," Jolie proves she can play rough in Kurt Wimmer's Salt
","While I can't say that I was awaiting Angelina Jolie's latest outing with bated breath, I was intrigued by the fact that Salt was originally intended to be a Tom Cruise vehicle.<br/><br/>Tom's waning box office pulling-power aside, this sex-swap was a smart move by writer Kurt Wimmer (Equilibrium) as it gives Jolie the chance to prove that she can lay the smack-down on just as many henchmen as the boys can. Having her rather than him as the duplicitous CIA agent Evelyn Salt, Wimmer gives a fresh angle to a plot that could easily have been a boring instalment of the Bourne series. Salt also sees the welcome return of Russian villains to the cinema after a long period in which Middle Eastern terrorists were severely over-worked.<br/><br/>When a Soviet defector strolls into the CIA and announces that Salt is a sleeper agent who will kill the Russian president, she goes on the run. Fearing for the safety of her husband Michael, Salt sets out to find him before agents Winter (Liev Schreiber) and Peabody (Chiwetel Ejiofor) catch up with her. The question of where Salt's loyalties lie is the true source of tension and Jolie plays it cool, gaining and dismissing the audience's trust several times over.<br/><br/>Schreiber and Ejiofor draw the short straws in terms of dialogue and simply run after Jolie for the entire movie without doing anything of significance. Hopefully, if the proposed sequel goes ahead, Wimmer will be able to correct this glaring oversight.<br/><br/>The action scenes are sharply directed and Jolie finally gets her hands dirty, particularly in the opening exchanges where she's being tortured in a Korean prison. If that wasn't enough, she also flies down an elevator shaft by leaping from wall to wall – it was a silly effect but added a cheesy, fanciful element to what would have been an entirely too serious movie.<br/><br/>Consequently the first 40 minutes are fast and furious as Salt evades her fellow agents by any means necessary but not to be outdone, the rest of the film takes a left turn and continues to surprise with some serious fisticuffs, gun-play and high-speed car chases. Admittedly, for all its skill and enthusiasm, Salt's finale is a little over-the-top and it wanders into well-worn ground without knowing when to stop. Aside from this minor gripe, Salt is a well-directed action movie that delivers us a potential new franchise, an intriguing lead character and an exciting close to a lacklustre summer."
"mr-natural","10","71","102","27 March 2011"," Jolie plays Bourne
","I enjoyed this flick - it's a satisfying thriller with nonstop action, and Jolie does it proud. I would like to say that I'm surprised by all the negative reviews, all of which seem to take offense at the various ""illogical"" and ""unrealistic"" aspects of the film. These same folks no doubt LOVE films like Star Wars and Pirates of the Caribbean, films of the fairy tale genre with license to dismiss realism altogether. Not that there's anything wrong with that. But it is too bad they can't appreciate a fine little thriller like this that just fudges with reality a bit. Almost every James Bond film was at least as silly as this film, but I loved all them too, as did most of the world. Maybe these picky folks are just a bunch of chauvinistic men and jealous women. I say let them eat cake."
"alex-rosenkrantz","7","9","10","14 November 2016"," I liked it
","When I first saw the rating I passed over it, but finally after looking at it a few more times, I decided to watch it. I'm glad I did. The plot was quite good. Deep and broad themes. The action was also surprisingly good. The moves easy to follow and made sense. A lot of movies nowadays use shaky cam, also well as excessive editing and angles to the point you can't even tell what's going on. It's actually quite annoying and can sometimes turn me off to an entire movie because of it. The action in this movie was the opposite. The end didn't really make sense at first, but the more I thought about it, there is a counter argument. Not enough to outweigh it. Basically the end didn't make much sense, but I can see what they were doing, I mean its pretty obvious. Anyways, good movie throughout, but they could have worked the ending better.<br/><br/>In conclusion, its a smart, deep, broad, and exciting movie. I'm glad I got passed the rating on IMDb and gave it a try."
"drangerholt","8","19","25","4 November 2012"," Excellent fun
","People who don't like films like Salt are the type you wouldn't want at parties. No fun, and anything that is fun is frowned upon. This film has great over the top action scenes, an entertaining plot with some unexpected twists and a good looking star. There are some of us old enough who remember when action films used to be all of the above and were proud of it. There's nothing in this film I can really complain about. Some of the stunts were wild and the situations she overcome near impossible but so were Rambos and that is now a classic. For heavens sake people. Have some fun and enjoy this one. Ignore the bores."
"thatgirlmyra-9946","8","5","5","29 July 2019"," Good If You Don't Think Too Hard
","This is a typical action film, and a good one at that. The acting is well-executed, the storyline pretty good, if a bit confusing at times, and the characters keep you guessing.<br/><br/>Salt, a government agent who has been accused if being a Russian sleeper agent is a well rounded character by the time the film is up, despite not being necessarily likeable. All of the other characters serve a good purpose to further the story.<br/><br/>The storyline is actually very good, with twists I personally didn't see coming! Maybe they might be a bit cliche or predictable looking back, but most action movies now are.<br/><br/>So overall, if you're looking for a late night film to watch to pass the time, this is a good choice."
"chrichtonsworld","6","128","202","19 August 2010"," Popcorn entertainment nothing more nothing less!
","While I was expecting a little more sophistication in the plot department I realized that such a thing couldn't happen when US versus Russia is at play. (To my knowledge the Cold War is over and the spy business has become more complicated than ever. This oversimplification of old enemies and their wars is too much.) The plot is all over the place and realism is thrown out of the door. There are too many things happening in the movie that are too convenient and even impossible. Still it didn't keep me from enjoying this movie. It even managed to thrill me at occasions even if I was aware that most of the plot was nonsense. Jolie does an excellent job as the action heroine. The action is that makes this movie tick and that is almost the only thing that should count in a movie like this.Ignore the bashing and trashing of Jolie. This is pure entertainment!"
"jane10357","7","255","422","20 July 2010"," Entertaining for sure
","Was it realistic? No. Did all the dots get connected? Not all. Was it fun to watch? Yes. Was it predictable? Not entirely. Lots of twists & turns. If you don't mind people sliding down a banister with six-shooters out shooting 5 hit men with Uzi's, then you'll probably like it. (This didn't really happen, and I don't really know guns but you get the message.) I thought I had it all figured out but I was oh so wrong. I would like to see it again, knowing what I know now. There wasn't a lot of cursing and relatively little blood & guts considering this type of movie. I must say, sitting next to some women who liked shouting at the screen and throwing their own punches heightened the excitement for the audience."

","Salt<br/><br/>By omitting pepper from this–the first ever–movie about seasoning, Hollywood has once again exhibited its racist tendencies.<br/><br/>Oh, wait. This movie isn't about the harmonious tabletop condiments, but a sleeper agent who awakens.<br/><br/>While cross-examining a Russian turncoat, CIA agent Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie) is made aware that she has been planted in America to assassinate the visiting Russian president.<br/><br/>Sought by her own agency as a traitor, Evelyn must go on the lam to clear her name. However, eluding her fellow agent/friend (Liev Schreiber) is not so easy.<br/><br/>With kinetic energy from the get go, Salt doesn't skimp on the action. But by not cutting back on the more fantastical sequences, this lady becomes impregnable.<br/><br/>In fact, the only way a woman would ever be able to take down hundreds of guys was if her child was pinned under a car and she was on her period.

"RoboRabbit89","7","12","15","16 November 2017"," I love Salt.
","Let's get going, back in July of 2010 I first seen this in theaters, when I first seen the trailer for this I definitely wanted to see it. Now, when I did seen this I absolutely loved it, I own it on DVD and have enjoyed it ever since.<br/><br/>Angelina Jolie is a bad ass chick in this film and I loved it, I hope she will do a sequel to this soon since the movie is left open ended.<br/><br/>I love spy thrillers and when done well they are fun, but I also like them as action films too. This film was very good, the action scenes are awesome and I thought the story was good too if not a little convoluted.<br/><br/>This was the only film I seen that summer but it was worth it, overall I give it a 7/10. Probably the best action film of the summer of that year and Angelina's best action film in her resume.<br/><br/>It was fun and action packed I highly recommend it."
"zetes","5","116","188","25 July 2010"," Dunderheaded action picture
","It almost seems as if it were scheduled to make up for the headiness of Chris Nolan's Inception (yeah, I know, it wasn't THAT smart, but compared to the vast majority of American blockbusters...). It's pretty much a Bourne rip-off. It stars Angelina Jolie as a CIA agent who is exposed as a Russian sleeper agent by a Russian defector. Whether she is one or not, her bosses (Chiwetel Ejiofor and Liev Schreiber) decide to keep her under wraps. She'll have none of that, though, as she fears for the safety of her spider expert husband. So basically, like Bourne, it's about a defecting agent running from her employers while simultaneously trying to foil the bad guys. The film does have a couple of semi-clever twists, but it also contains a metric ton of stupidity. There's no real set-up for Jolie being some kind of Bourne-like superwoman, yet as soon as the action sequences start she's either MacGuiver or Jackie Chan. Weighing in at about 95 pounds (seriously, Angie, eat a burger) she's able to beat the everloving crap out of every trained CIA, FBI or Secret Service agent who gets in her way. The filmmaking is reminiscent of Bourne, but, unlike Bourne, the choreography is confusing and implausible. Very little of the plot makes any sense, from the reason for the initial exposure to Jolie's motivations to the final sequence. Any moderate examination reveals the film to make no sense whatsoever."
"classicalsteve","6","67","105","12 September 2010"," Entertaining Action Thriller But Die Hard Becomes Die Never; Also the Plot Development Gets a Little Unbelievable
","When Bruce Willis makes crash landings in the original ""Die Hard"" movie, at least he winces in pain and it takes him a few moments to regain composure. In ""Salt"", when Angelina Jolie jumps consecutively onto six moving trucks on the freeway, she's flying right up and instantly running at Olympic record pace, sort of like the original Terminator except sporting lipstick. Throughout the movie, she decks secret service agents faster than they can graduate out of combat training if she's not pushing out of moving vehicles going 70 mph while wearing handcuffs, although the officers forgot to put the cuffs on behind her. They put them on in front of her leaving her with a slight chance to get away. I guess the point of this movie: don't try this at home.<br/><br/>The essential plot I think is quite compelling, and I don't want to give too much away but only to say that nothing is at it seems until the very end. But I think I would have liked more of the mystery behind the story than all the long action sequences which I felt undermined a potentially complex idea. These days in filmmaking, it seems that the longer action sequences displace story development. There are flashbacks to a greater story but a lot of it was more confusing than insightful.<br/><br/>After a brief prelude in which Jolie is interrogated and tortured by North Korean military agents, the movie begins, presumably about a year later, with a Russian requesting asylum with the United States via the CIA. Agent Evelyn Salt (Jolie) interrogates the defector who tells a strange story about how the Russians infiltrate the United States with moles programmed and brainwashed during childhood. Only seconds after the interview is over, the defector is killing CIA agents and escaping the headquarters. And so is Salt. In fact, the agency is more determined to get Salt than the defector, which is one of the many little glaring plot problems that occur during this movie. The non-stop action begins here, fueled by several plots and subplots.<br/><br/>I think Salt is a decent film but not a great one. At least what it does successfully is keep you guessing. You're not sure what Salt is doing, where she's going, or even whose side she's on which keeps you at the edge of your seat. By movies end, I still had a lot of unanswered questions that were not explained through the action sequences. I also realized at one point, Jolie doesn't say much after the initial interview until the very end. It's hard not to like Jolie but I think she should have requested a bit of a better script with a little bit less chasing, gunning and blowing things up. Jolie can also act, not just chase."
"TheOneThatYouWanted","8","19","26","24 September 2017"," Salty Spy
","Not sure why this film is not as well received as it should be. It is about an American CIA or FBI agent who is compromised in order to set off a series of events leading to global chaos. This film has a lot of moving parts but is handled well and it is very entertaining. The action is well choreographed and shot without annoying shaky cam. Plus it is non- stop. This film didn't do well enough to merit a sequel, which is a shame because this is an outstanding example of a kickbutt film with a strong female lead. I guess that sort of thing wasn't trending hard enough back then. Sad how Hollywood is using important issues as a mean to market films nowadays. But what is sadder is how people buy into it. Anyway this is a great spy thriller worth checking."

Just as 50Kg woman which can be thrown against the wall and have no even single bruise after.<br/><br/>I wonder, do all Americans still know Russia as it is shown in this film? Or it is just comfortable to utilize 30 year old image because developing new one and showing it can reduce cash flow? But the action itself (if you switch off your brain for 1h30min) is good.

"Screen_Blitz","7","7","8","17 November 2017"," It is an explosive, briskly-paced spy action foray scorching with an appealing image of Angelina Jolie
","When Angelina Jolie makes her appearance on screen, chances are most people are interested in seeing in nothing but her kicking some major ass. And for those who relished in a good time of shoving popcorn in their mouth while watching her go gun-blazing in the action thriller 'Wanted' back in 2008, this one makes a sound, if slightly lesser option. This spy action thriller, helmed from director Phillip Noyce who brought his work to the screen with two Jack Ryan adaptations 'Patriot Games' and 'Clear and Present Danger', is just another one of your average trips to the land of Angelina Jolie wielding her action skills against the baddies as she fights her way through the sporadic blemishes in the script written by Kurt Wimmer. Unlike 'Wanted', this flick proceeds with a slightly more political agenda at hand, primarily the corruption uprooted from Russia since the beginning of their fallout with the United States during the Cold War. This film focuses on Evelyn Salt (played by Angelina Jolie), a CIA operative who is a living a peaceful life with her German boyfriend Michael Krause (played by August Diehl) and being held as one of the most respectable agents at her job. Her life comes crashing down when she is accused by a captured Russian agent Orlov (played by Daniel Olbrychski) of being a Russian sleeper agent with a plan to assassinate the President of the United States. With the law enforcement along with Agent Peabody (played by Chiwetel Eijiofor) pursuing her and her boss Ted Winter (played by Liev Schieber) the only one who fully trusts her, Salt must set out on a mission to clear her name. <br/><br/>For a movie set on exhibiting Jolie in her frenetic ass-kicking mode, this one delivers for the most part. Watching the actress step into action with a frenetic gun-blazing, bone-crunching convulsion makes the tasty icing on the cake most action junkies crave for. But those who make the decision of taking the ride seriously fall victim to witnessing the flaws in the film's attempt at establishing a solid political complex. Adding substance to the plot is a political theme involving international corruption and relations between the U.S and Russia which ties knowledge the historical threats of the Soviet Union during the Cold War back in the 50s. It also makes the unfortunate feat of occasionally convoluting the plot, especially when throwing in a few twists and turns that will take audiences by surprise or leave them scratching their heads. Regardless, anyone willing to escape these blemishes are in for a nice treat, and that witnessing Angelina Jolie shoot, punch, and kick were way through the story in a sleek James Bond-style. Tension is kept high and the action falls nothing short of beauty, especially when adding explosions, car crashes, and vehicles slipping to the equation. For what the movie offers, it does enough to meet the appetite of cinema-goers hungry for a blend of sleek action thrills with brainy political subtext to go in the mix. <br/><br/>Salt is an entertaining ride, if somewhat forgettable in terms of cinematic action mayhem. For those craving a sweet kick of action, this makes a fresh choice, though it nothing that reaches the peak of its genre. All that can be said is that fun and thrills is the best thing this movie delivers if nothing more."
"lesleyharris30","7","7","8","25 July 2013"," Very Predictable,
","Salt is a good movie with a very enjoyable,albeit very predictable storyline,and a pretty impressive performance from Angelina Jolie.It didn't surprise or shock me once,I found everything was going to happen extremely predictable,but I did enjoy the great action sequences in this movie and Angelina Jolie suited Evelyn Salt perfectly.I heard rumors about a sequel and if one was made I would go see it because the ending made a continuation very seem very promising.The movie is a fun ride and I would recommend it to action movie fans,but don't be expecting a very good movie,just some good action.<br/><br/>Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie),a CIA agent,has to flee when a Russian defector claims she's a sleeper agent about to commit an act of terrorism."
"The-Sarkologist","8","13","17","12 May 2018"," A Thrill Ride
","I saw this film in the cinemas a while back and didn't really think much of it. However I watched it again recently and was really impressed. In fact I was a little surprised that I hadn't written a review of it them, but that is probably a good thing because it means that I can now return to this film with a fresh mind, and a fresh opinion, and also give it the rating that it deserves.
 The film starts off in North Korea where Evelyn Salt, a CIA agent, is being tortured. It appears that she is going to be left for dead, which is to be expected, until a surprising trade comes about and she is released. A little later a Russian diplomat comes into the CIA to offer some information, and suggests that there are a number of Soviet era sleeper agents in the US, and proceeds to finger her as one of them. This is where the fun starts.
 Throughout the film you are never quite sure what is what and who is who. In fact you are never really sure whether Salt is working for the Russians or not, and I won't reveal whether she actually is. In fact you never know who is a sleeper agent and who isn't, and there are some very interesting revelations that come out through the movie, leading you right to an action packed ending.
 In a way we are seeing a post Cold-War Russia, but the thing is that the old Soviet system has never really gone away. One of the targets in the film is the Russian President, and there is a suggestion that he is actually Boris Yeltsin, and a part of me suspects that there is a group within Russia that wants to return to the Cold War era. While there wasn't anything particularly said about what was going on, there was this idea playing in the background.
 The really interesting thing was the suggestion that American diplomats in Russia during the cold war were killed, and their children taken by the Russians and brain washed before being handed back to the United States (or even switched). This was what was insinuated in the opening scene where Salt is speaking with the Diplomat. In reality it is unclear as to how many of these sleeper agents are present, because it seems that the United States government is unaware of how many of these children were brainwashed. Not surprisingly, they made their way into some very influential organisations.
 This is one of those movies that could easily be considered one long thrilling ride from beginning to end. In another way, one wonders how it is that the United States is unaware of something odd going on, if the parents of all these children are incidentally killed. I'm sure after a few there would suddenly be some questions being asked. The other thing is that some people turn out to be agents, even though there was no real hint from the get-go - sometimes I feel that maybe there should be some hints so that it doesn't come out hugely unrealistic. Still, this was a great film, and other that kept me at the edge of my seat all the way through."
"Henry_Ireton","1","144","245","28 August 2010"," Absolute RUBBISH
","I thought that this film would be an exciting mix of action, thriller, espionage and drama. Instead it's an overblown farce and a plot resembling blancmange. Angelina Jolie plays a spy for the CIA who turns out to be a Russian spy as well. So she gets exposed and runs away (but somehow doesn't look anything the action figure of Lara Croft but quite ungainly and pathetic) and uses a black wig and sunglasses like a Matrix character which doesn't hide her at all. In fact, at one point when trying to allude the CIA she disguises herself in a Russian fur hat and fur coat. Hilarious! In another scene she randomly picks some dry cleaning off a rail in a hotel and surprise surprise the suit fits like it's tailored. Her disguise to go into the White House is just so ridiculous that you actually feel shame for the director and make up artist. Interestingly throughout the film special agent ""Salt"" does not kill a single American, however she kills every Russian she can. And we are supposed to be wondering if she's a Russian spy? This film is so bad and panders so shamefully to the uneducated ill informed American conception of an evil enemy that really the only thing missing is the idea of an Arab funding it all from a cave in Afghanistan.<br/><br/>The film ends, thankfully, but unthankfully with Jolie running off into the woods,fade to black and you can just here the film studio setting up storyboards for a sequel.

Her strong and believable presence carries the movie. Kudos also to Liev Schreiber and Chiwetel Ejiofor for making their characters interesting and very believable. Good acting greatly helps me 'buy in' to the story. However, as a fan of good writing, ""SALT"" left me somewhat disappointed. I enjoyed the premise of the film and some of the plot twists, but the script is so full of holes, you'd think Evelyn Salt had blasted it with a machine gun! I will not mention any specific plot faults, so as to not spoil the movie for you. In conclusion, ""SALT"" earns an '8' for action; an '8' for acting; but only a '5' for writing. That's an average of 7, which makes ""SALT"" a tasty action movie worth watching."

I been a fan of hers since the first Tomb Raider. Liev Schreiber did a pretty good job as well.<br/><br/>This movie is just one of those action movies with a great plot twist.

","Phillip Noyce's 'Salt' is a decent action-thriller that focuses on Spys. The film has it's share of shortcomings, but manages to sail safely.<br/><br/>Angelina Jolie stars as Salt a CIA agent, who is accused of being a double agent. Her journey from there-after, is filled with loads of action, and many twists and turns.<br/><br/>'Salt' has a paper-thin plot, but it's list of twists keep the proceedings alive. However, I would like to state, that, the culmination doesn't appeal. The actual twist in the tale doesn't leave any impact whatsoever. Writers Kurt Wimmer and Brian Helgeland could've truly worked for a better culmination.<br/><br/>Phillip Noyce's direction is fair, while the stunts are the mainstay of the film. Angelina Jolie is excellent as Salt and goes on to prove her potential once again. Among other performances, Liev Schreiber and Chiwetel Ejiofor leave a lasting impression.<br/><br/>On the whole, 'Salt' also offers some spice. Apart from a tacky culmination, this one truly ranks as a fit popcorn flick. Reccmended!"

","The movie is utterly outrageous. Nothing in it is barely logical. From start to finish what you see is Angelina Jolie as an indestructible war machine with no plausible or understandable aim. A really bad movie... unless you care only about fighting scenes and impossible action. Like don't getting a bruise jumping from car to car, climbing barehanded the wall of a fifteen storeys building, jumping in a winter lake from a helicopter, or swooping down an elevator shaft. One of the worst movies ever. The people dubbing in Russian are even not that bad, but the overall impression is quite sad. BTW, have you seen the handcuffs? With a half-meter chain between them, you can really hurt somebody... Did you notice that she has a blood stain on her back when she got shot, even if she is wearing a bullet-proof jacket?"

","Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie) is a CIA operative who having recently been repatriated in a Korean prisoner swap, is back behind a desk looking forward to going home to her arachnologist husband. On her way out of the door, she and her boss ""Ted"" (Liev Schreiber) are diverted to deal with an hitherto unknown Russian who in the course of his interrogation names her as a Russian spy. Now we hit ""Bourne"" meets ""Lara Croft"" mode as she is determined to get back to her husband and to prove she is not an enemy agent before Chitiwel Ejiofor (""Peadbody"") and his FBI buddies nail her slats to the mast. It's end to end action with lots of car chases, explosions, gun battles and the usual red herrings as she tries to hunt down the real bad guys. It is an action thriller, not a documentary - so don't expect Pulitzer standard writing nor for it to be especially plausible or to make much sense; it's just a good old take-over-the-world adventure movie with decent performances all round."

There is a little bit for everybody. The build up in the movie was great as well, from begging to end this movie never lets go of that tension it has built up. What also really helped this movie was the lack of plot holes. With a blockbuster hit like SALT, the director normally has no problems leaving big plot holes in the script, but this film doesn't do that. This movie was thought out immaculately. Last but not least, lets also give a shout out to Angelina Jolie (SALT) for giving her best performance in years. Any movie critic can give her credit for her Oscar winning performance.<br/><br/>CONS: There are very little cons to this movie. The only thing that could have been more realized is the resolution.

","The people who wrote this film apparently don't think the audience is very smart.

Boy she is one tough, ass kicking mama! Some people have said this movie is merely a clone of the Jason Bourne movies (one reviewer waggishly called Salt Jason Bourne with a vagina). However, Jolie makes her role distinctly unique. She holds this movie together with cool intensity that would rival any actor. The plot is convoluted and hard to follow but there is enough action for five movies, so just sit back and enjoy the ride.

","While this movie starts off rather interesting, with good setting, sharp optics and good introduction, it snuffs every bit of enjoyment after only 15 minutes into the story. And then it's all downhill from there.<br/><br/>Let's be honest for a while: - Someone escaping a major CIA installation without any amount of pre-planning or warning time? - The entire CIA and police lacking any and all choppers or officers on motorcycles? - No one in the entire CIA trying to shoot a suspected spy that is escaping with full force only seconds after being uncovered? - One assassin able to overthrow all the protection the Secret Service and the CIA can provide even if they are warned weeks in advance of that assassination plan, even knowing the assassin personally, while said assassin has only two sticks of C4 and three simple handguns at her disposal? - After killing the Russian president, the assassin and Russian spy and prime suspect is only escorted by two lousy city police patrol cars with no armor and no back-up? - This Russian spy and assassin getting so badly handcuffed it can not only escape the patrol car, but disable everyone including the driver within seconds AND gain control of the car? - The Russian spy agency needlessly, thoughtlessly killing the long and truly loved spouse of their best agent for no reason, after she completed the mission she was supposed to - without the Russians even trying to use the husband as bait or blackmail, alienating their perfectly placed mole and thereby ultimately ruining a perfect plan that spans the entire NATO leadership and took more than two decades to put into action? - Since when are Soviet-Russian spies doing suicide bombings? - One man is able to infiltrate the inner sanctum of the US administration, kill the entire cabinet in seconds, wall himself in, start the nuclear countdown? - That man still unable to fend off one women that has just lost her husband, job, mentor and political orientation even though he is inside the most protected structure of the US and she is not? - The CIA and secret service AGAIN unable to handcuff that women so she can AGAIN kill someone while restrained?<br/><br/>The director should have hired a group of ten-year-olds as advisers in plain old common sense. If they seem to be smarter than the CIA agents portrayed on-screen, re-work the plot to spare the average audience from disbelief-induced brain cramps."

"twenty-four-fps","6","13","18","8 February 2011"," Great Action Sequences !
","Great action sequences. Questionable plot. Limited character development.<br/><br/>I enjoy spy films, and remember having liked the 1994 ""Clear and Present Danger"" (starring Harrison Ford), also directed by Phillip Noyce, so I decided to see ""Salt"" and bought the Blu-ray. The disk has all three versions and lots of interesting extra features, including a commentary by Phillip Noyce, and interviews with real-life spies, such as the famous former Counterintelligence KGB General Oleg Kalugin, now an American citizen. <br/><br/>""Salt"" is an enjoyable film, better, I say, than all Bourne films, or ""Mission Impossible"" (with the possible exception of the first one, directed by Brian de Palma, where Angelina Jolie's father plays), and also better than many James Bond films, with, perhaps, the exception of the 1963 ""From Russia with Love"", from which ""Salts"" borrows something - remember Colonel Rosa Klebb played by Lotte Lenya ? <br/><br/>Moles in the CIA (and FBI), ""sleepers"", ""illegals in dormant state waiting to be activated for sinister purposes against the West, Soviet/Russian (KGB, SVR, FSB) defectors after defectors ... all are true and not new - see ""Telefon"" (1977, with Charles Bronson), ""The Fourth Protocol"" (1987, with Pierce Brosnan, ""The Good Shepherd"" (2006, also with Angelina Jolie), ""The Company"" (2007, TV with Michael Keaton). <br/><br/>Angelina Jolie, Liev Schrieber, and Daniel Olbrychski do well as Evelyn Salt, and, like many others, I liked watching them, but I have two serious problems with the plot. Not so much the impossible acrobatics and escapes and infiltrations ... but the premise of the film itself:<br/><br/><ul><li>How is it possible to depict (and make us believe that) The Secret Service is so ineffective ... Bystanders ... ?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The ""defector"".</li></ul><br/><br/>1. A Russian spy comes to the CIA, and reveals top secrets about former Soviet, now Russian operations against the United States. He even uncovers the identity of a mole inside CIA ranks. OK - Good deeds ! But, if he is a genuine defector, why, after being interviewed, does he kills his CIA guards, and then escapes ... Doing this only discredits his testimony. That is not how a genuine defector behaves.<br/><br/>2. If, on the other hand he is not a genuine defector, but an active enemy agent, someone who came to activate ""sleepers"", why does he have to come in and reveal everything to the CIA, including uncovering the identity of a top mole in the CIA, thus, gravely endangering the mission his agents (the sleepers) are to carry out ? If he only needed to provide instructions to his undercover agents, he could have used other methods of communication. This is not how an offensive (let us call him ""a non-genuine defector"") behaves.<br/><br/>3. If, further, this was just a temporary defection, with the sole purpose of uncovering to the CIA the identity of a mole (the Theatrical and Director's Cut versions of th film, but not the Extended version suggests this), than it was not at all necessary to reveal the rest of the plan to the CIA (that this mole, a Russian agent will soon attempt to kill ...), and, definitely, it was absolutely wrong for the defector to kill his guards and escape. So, bad logic. Am I wrong ? <br/><br/>We, the viewers like thrillers, action, adventure, spy stuff (deception after deception, double-cross, multiple against and allegiances), but we also like solid, smart and plausible intelligence (brain, analytical) work behind the action - e.g. ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy (1979, TV) and ""Smiley's People"" (1982, TV) both with Alec Guiness Not too much ""intelligence"" work in ""Salt"", just a lot of (great !) action sequences ... there is too much Phillip Noyce expects us to accept, take for granted. <br/><br/>On the positive side: ""Salt"" may also be viewed the soul-searching journey of a double-agent who struggles with the question: ""On which side am I ?"" or ""On which side should I be ?"" In the end the agent decides where the allegiance should be placed, and chooses the side who advocates morality and humanity. <br/><br/>If you do not ask (too many) questions, ""Salt"" is definitely enjoyable."

","Typical Hollywood action trash with no story, no logic, little acting. It's so bad it's hard where to start. The plot is laughably outrageous. It seems that movie makers believe if they don't outdo competition and themselves in the ridiculousness department, it won't sell. Maybe they do have a point, as the American audience seems to have addiction problems, and they seek ever increasing doses of unbelievability when it comes to plot and action sequences. This year's movies gotta have louder explosions, more car chases, even more impossible stunts, and bigger conspiracy theories than last year's.<br/><br/>The first 10-15 minutes were OK. Even the washed up actress AJ managed to portray a somewhat passable and vulnerable agent. I was even willing to buy the makeshift bazooka under the principle of suspension of disbelief. But with the tomb raider sequence of truck jumping, the ""movie"" took a huge nosedive. AJ is superwoman after that and there is no ounce of suspense. She will of course save the world.<br/><br/>Am I to believe these sleeper cells take the most convoluted, most illogical, most difficult path to achieving their goals? Nothing is tied together. The onus of thinking up a rhyme or reason is all left to the viewer since the scriptwriters could not make sense of the script they wrote.<br/><br/>The ""twist"" was apparent within the first 15 minutes of the movie. Those who really believe Hollywood will cast AJ as an evil Russian spy should be deemed to stupid to own a driver's license to get to the theatre. So, who does that leaves the villain to be?

","Salt (2010) <br/><br/>*** (out of 4) <br/><br/>CIA Agent Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie) is accused of being a spy for Russia with plans on killing the Russian president to set off a world war. Salt eventually breaks free and tries to prove her innocence while at the same time stopping the real bad guys. In my opinion SALT goes down as one of the dumbest action movies in the history of cinema. The screenplay has so many plot holes that you could fly a plane the size of Russia through it. There are action scenes that are so fake and impossible that you can't help roll your eyes. The idea of Salt being able to get into the White House and down into the emergency area where a nuclear attack is about to begin is just crazy. Every single inch of this movie has cheese all over it but at the same time the thing is simply entertaining. It's hard to believe that someone would attempt to do a film like this because of how crazy it is. At times I had to remind myself that I wasn't watching some sort of spoof as I was waiting for Jolie to utter ""Salt. Evelyn Salt."" This movie has so many crazy scenes yet director Noyce holds all of them together with some nice style and of course we get a strong performance by Jolie who sells every bit of craziness. One of the biggest action sequences in the film has Salt running away from dozens of cops and eventually jumping off a bridge and onto a moving semi. She then jumps from semi A to semi B where she eventually jumps on a few more things only to take off once again. This entire sequence perfectly sums up the film because the action is nice but at the same time it's so crazy and over the top that you can't help but wonder if anyone was really expecting you to take it serious. The entire story is just downright crazy as this attempt to take over the world and star a war is something that ""C"" movies from the 50s would be laughing at. If it sounds like I'm being overly hard on the film I'm really not meaning to. The craziness here isn't a bad thing because it's part of the reason SALT is so entertaining. Jolie has no problem fitting the role with that laid back humor and toughness. She even gets to do some dramatic acting in the final few minutes, which I won't ruin. The supporting cast includes nice work by Liev Schreiber and Chiwetel Ejiofor. If you're unable to turn your brain off for 100-minutes then I'd recommend you stay away from this film because it's ""plot"" will probably be too much for you to overlook. If you can sit back and enjoy a lot of craziness and action then SALT is just the film for you."

We've seen many movies (few released this year) with the same storyline. It's a fashion that the smart and good-hearted guy who helps the protagonist is the twisting antagonist. We've seen it in The Fugitive, THe A-Team and even in Die Another Day. When Salt tries such a thing, I could easily predict the baddie. I'm not gonna spill any more beans.

","By its courage on enlightening KGB's anti-globalist vista, I first thought Salt is an adaptation, till I find out the fact that it's written for the screen by Kurt Wimmer, the genius writer of Equilibrium(2002)-which is the best contemporary sci-fi screenplay I've ever heard of-. As a matter of production, if Salt is especially written for Angelina Jolie to play the lead, Phillip Noyce isn't a bad choice at all to direct the movie; but I could still have preferred Kurt Wimmer to direct it, as he did the Equilibrium. <br/><br/>Angelina Jolie's first action was Cyborg-2(1993), in which she showed the white feather for a thrill to be created out of a bad Jean-Claude Van Damme sequel; and she was pretty good at that. Consider that I compare her acting from the age of 18 with her capacity in Salt, herein she doesn't act nothing. It is either the director or herself that makes the movie seems like it's been done before with same look of scenes from Tomb Raider or Tom Cruise's Mission Impossible and the likes of them.<br/><br/>As a whole, Salt is well worth to see and enjoy with suspense-action-thriller type of storyline. But as the one thing in common with all the suspense stories, there is a breach in the story development. It gets complicated and confusing at times forcing us to figure out if Jolie is working for CIA or KGB. The fact is that Jolie betrays every person she meets. She betrays CIA first, then when we start guessing she's a Russian militant but then she assassinated the Russian president. The problem is that what everyone calls them plot holes, there are no plausible reasons for why Jolie betrays everybody. Maybe in real life Brad Pitt asked this question to himself too."

","Although action movies are not my favourite ones, the fact I liked ""Salt"", suggests to me it is a good movie, at least entertaining, thrilling, and being able to keep me watching, almost holding my breath, till the end. It's a movie full of energy, running, chase sequences: the heroine, Angelina Jolie, is really a portent of physical endurance, pure energy beyond all human credibility, she overcomes any obstacle, and makes you feel that energy and strength.<br/><br/>The plot is obviously full of holes, almost absurd, but I guess plot is not so much important in this genre, being it is just a pretext in the service of action. Obviously everything sounds unreal, disregarding the most elementary laws of physics, but still action, and dynamism are what keep you attached to the screen till the very end. A good picture, certainly a tribute to the still flourishing beauty of Angelina Jolie, whose physical impact makes a difference and makes her role intense and effective, besides every excess and lack of realism.

More attention should have been paid to character development than seeing how many trucks Jolie's character could jump onto. Why did they automatically think she was a Russian spy and try to kill her? Wouldn't they want to interrogate her first? Why start shooting first thing? And at the end, I'm assuming the president didn't die (or didn't appear to have), so why couldn't they keep her locked up on site until the president came around and told them who dunnit? Because that would have been an easy end, and that's the only reason. This movie was only 99 minutes long, if that, but it could have easily been thirty with the amount of plot it actually contained. Too bad. The premise was interesting.<br/><br/>Lastly, would someone tell Liev Schrieber to stop playing the same role over and over? I knew he was the real bad guy about 10 minutes into the movie."

","I went to see this film after a friend's sister recommended it. I went in with the knowledge that Angelina has previously not played the lead in any film I have liked and the trailer for this looked terrible. Open mind as much as I could. The story seemed like it was locked in a draw marked ""80's cold war plots"" that has been adapted to modern day my mentioning the Middle East in the script in the final moments and giving people blackberry's. I did one interesting thing through the movie where it confused me for a minute as to who she was and what here motives were. Even to the point that I thought she had a twin which might have made an interesting twist. Sadly no such twist as it played out she was super woman in a little skinny woman's body, Russians are bad, and Americans are great.<br/><br/>The Cast defiantly ""mailed it in"" on this one. Starting with Angelina she pouts and looks annoyed all movies and I know people are really attracted to her but just not my cup of tea. Her acting is wooden and makes no connection with the audience so I did not care what happened to the wronged ""Salt"". Liev Schreiber puts in his usual presence as toughest guys in the room and has the best performance of the lot but with a script this weak what can you expect. Chiwetel Ejiofor who I have liked in other things played the chasing agent role that is marked ""insert actor here"" limited again. Probably the strangest cast choice in the film is August Diehl who plays Salt's husband that changed her life. He has a look a look that says he might have been the one behind it all. A strange choice for Angelina's hubby, or it could have been a deliberate one to get away from a Brad clone in the role.<br/><br/>I did not like this film and would not recommend it to anyone. If you like bad acting, weak writing, big explosions, and huge plot holes this will be a great night out for you. <br/><br/>SPOILERS of plot holes She was trained as a Russian spy until 6 all the prep you need to be super woman<br/><br/>The white house bunker has so many security holes it's like a video game<br/><br/>Angelina would shatter if she fell off the sidewalk let alone stop motorbike, jump onto moving vehicles and fall out of helicopters<br/><br/>A boat of Russian spies from the academy that were covered in Russian mafia tattoos??

","Even an intentionally brainless film like this needs more than Angelina Jolie just running around shooting up stuff to be entertaining.<br/><br/>Jolie phones it in. From a cell phone that dropped the signal. She is really awful in this, and it's obvious she couldn't care less. As usual, she wears clichéd black outfits. Her vampy Xena wannabe expression while she blasts people gets old way too fast; even she appears bored with the dull routine. The rest of the cast are not much better; calling them paper cut-outs is an insult to paper cut-outs. <br/><br/>The plot is absolutely preposterous, and it only gets more absurd as it goes along. Jolie is a spy who gets framed for cold-war double agent shenanigans. Lots of bumbling clowns chase her and shoot. Committing the offense of making this film is far worse than espionage, and that's what they should have shot her for; but it's all academic anyway since they couldn't hit the broad side of a barn from three feet away.<br/><br/>Don't expect your money's worth of entertainment value from this, except maybe from laughing at it."

The action sequences are not totally realistic sometimes, but still much more realistic than many other movies and they did a great a decision on not using CGI all the time (actually, i don't remember any scene with CGI, maybe the explosion on the white house, but that's OK). And all those things about children being trained, the White House Bunker and many others are all true, which is something very scary and even more exciting. Who is Salt? I think this was the beginning, and we can discover more about Evelyn Salt in a sequel. Salt is dangerous, determinated, and knows what she wants.

","Do not walk, or worse, stop to read reviews, but run instead to the nearest movie theater and watch Salt.<br/><br/>I say don't read the reviews because a lot of what the movie critics say may deter you from seeing what is truly not only an exciting summer movie but a movie which is sure to pave the way for other female actresses to play similar lead action hero roles in the future.<br/><br/>The critics may be right in saying that the plot (like a thousand other action movies before it) has plenty of holes and is filled with one unrealistic chase scene after another. And, they may raise a valid point that a movie about post-cold war Russian villains may be decades too stale. <br/><br/>But, what these critics fail to do is give credit where credit is due. And that is: Angelina Jolie delivers an Oscar-worthy portrayal of CIA Agent, Salt, who may or may not be a Russian spy. You never really know until the end as Jolie keeps you guessing with every twist, turn, kick, shot, explosion, jump, chase, injury, and ass whooping, regardless of whether she is the one giving or receiving the whooping.<br/><br/>Yep, I used the ""O"" word. I don't particularly care much for Ms. Jolie generally speaking which makes me even more certain that she deserves the award. I loved Salt because Jolie made me believe that a 110 pound woman can whip the crap out of 100 men, each two to three times her weight. Actually, she did better than that. She made me forget she is female. I just saw Jolie as a tough-as-nails ass-kicker.<br/><br/>Jolie as Salt had me on the edge-of-my seat nervous. She sent my heart racing the entire time. She made me laugh; she made me cheer; she made me angry. She had me confused as hell as to who she really is. But, best of all, by the end of the movie, she made me find myself holding in my breath for a few seconds and crying a bit because I realized what Jolie has really accomplished by this role.<br/><br/>Jolie has undeniably pulled off a first in history: She more than capably held her own as an action hero lead, a character which was originally written with a man in mind (Tom Cruise). I dare to even say that Salt with Jolie as the lead may fare better at the Box Office than Salt with Cruise would have fared. Why? Without Jolie, Salt would be just another ordinary action-packed movie. Fun, but ordinary. But Jolie adds a few extra layers to the character which Tom may or may not have been able to deliver as well.<br/><br/>At pertinent times, Jolie certainly possesses the requisite coldness and bravado that Tom would have brought to the character. But, when necessary, Jolie also infuses heart, a sense of alluring mystery, charming vulnerability, and woman-scorned vengeance into Salt which makes us fall helplessly in love with that character yet tremendously fear her at the same time. I am not sure Tom or most men could pull that alluring mystery and vulnerability off as well. And what do they say? ""Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned."" Jolie surely proves that theory correct with her portrayal of Agent Salt.<br/><br/>Call me sexist. Maybe I am. But I loved this movie mostly because a woman was the lead; and because a woman filled the theater to full capacity and had the audience cheering at times and gasping for air at others just like or possibly even better than the Tom Cuises, Matt Damons and Brad Pitts of the world have in the past. Jolie made me a believer. And I know she will make a believer out of movie executives when Salt brings in the ticket sales. And all future female action leads owe Jolie a big thank you for being such a mysterious, vulnerable, charming, money-making, ass-kicking machine. Parisa Michelle Founder, www.CelebMagnet.com"
"moviewizguy","7","24","46","30 July 2010"," Who is Salt?
","As a CIA officer, Evelyn Salt swore an oath to duty, honor and country. Her loyalty will be tested when a defector accuses her of being a Russian spy. Salt goes on the run, using all her skills and years of experience as a covert operative to elude capture. Salt's efforts to prove her innocence only serve to cast doubt on her motives, as the hunt to uncover the truth behind her identity continues and the question remains: ""Who Is Salt?"" (Columbia Pictures)<br/><br/>SALT is preposterous, absurd, and unbelievable. The filmmakers know this very well. Yet, it's an extremely well made action flick. Unlike INCEPTION, SALT never tries to be groundbreaking cinema. It's never too ambition and wrapped in its own world. It never tries to be anything more than what it really is: A highly enjoyable action film. AKA: The perfect summer movie. Because of this, SALT succeeds in almost every level.<br/><br/>Star Angelina Jolie actually brings the film on another level. She's just very impressive in her role, bringing an emotional depth for her character and doing the terrific stunt works throughout the film. She does it all here, leaping from the tops of vehicles driving at high speed on the highway, making an exploding device with a fire extinguisher and some household chemicals, and running with no shoes on from one place to another, just to name a few. She's clearly THE female action hero. Liev Schreiber doesn't seem to have much to do but he's as good as always. I also liked seeing Chiwetel Ejiofor in more films because he's a unique actor.<br/><br/>The film is also filled with many chase scenes that are done really well that is sure to pump up your adrenaline. The action sequences are surprisingly inventive and ingenious as well, the soundtrack by the brilliant James Newton Howard accompanying it with skill and playfulness. Let's not forget the light use of CGI and camera shakiness, making the experience a whole lot better than it already is.<br/><br/>Overall, SALT shows us that Angelina Jolie is still the great action star that she always was and that action flicks can still be well made. While it won't change the world, it's a very entertaining summer action film that is sure to result in the same reaction the condiment of the very same name produced."

","Angelina Jolie is the true icon of what you would call a female that can fill in the shoes for any masculine role. And what kind of audience wouldn't want that? She's a role model for women because of her talent of displaying power in the feminine lead, and for the guys, she makes them drool because of her ability to be sexy while being powerful at the same time. A benefit for both ends of the stick and there is no doubt that Jolie will not give such a performance for a film with a premise like this.<br/><br/>The title is based on the main character, Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie), a CIA agent who is revealed to be a Russian spy sent on a mission with several other Russian spies to overthrow the United States of America. Once Salt realizes this, she flees from the government to try and discover why she is being sought after. Unfortunately (for her character), this leads to many twists and turns along the way. As for audiences' go this is probably the most troublesome part of the film.<br/><br/>Kurt Wimmer, an individual who isn't a novice to the film industry, but doesn't seem to have a true understanding of what audiences want or expect to see in their films, wrote the screenplay. The way the story is written is so up and down on who's on what side, can become really tiresome. It does allow the movie to create a sense of paranoia about who is really who, but it is not given in a fashion that makes it any more clear for the audience either. In fact, depending on how avid a film-goer you are, this movie may take more than one viewing to truly understand what went down in the whole film. It really can be frustrating at times to keep up with what viewpoint the main characters' have and what side they support.<br/><br/>Along with this, is the system of child hypnosis that a Russian antagonist puts on these ""creations"" of his. It is a really convoluted plot and sometimes it sounds just plain ridiculous. Also, anti-heroes are cool and have neat traits but for me, I just couldn't get over the fact of how Salt's character is always on the run. Yes she did fight (which I'll get to in a second) but a lot of the time she was fleeing from the authorities because she had NO ONE else to go to. Those kinds of plot lines annoy me because it feels like there's no hope for the character.<br/><br/>As for acting goes, the actors all portray their characters well and understandably. None seem out of place or overacted. Jolie's abilities to perform action are still there as well. She still has the muscle to throw herself and others around while looking attractive at the same time. She's always good at doing that. I also liked the transition that Jolie's character made from the beginning to the end of the film with the color of her hair. Light to dark always shows a change in character tone and it's shown very accurately. <br/><br/>As for James Newton Howard's musical score, I wasn't quite sure if he forgot how to portray emotion. His score definitely knows how to build tension with the blaring horns. But the emotional side of his music seems to be lacking. There are some vocals that reminisce of the Russian culture (which usually sounds tragic) but it doesn't occur frequently. Perhaps Howard missed these points in the film.<br/><br/>With Angelina Jolie back in her action boots, there's bound to be plenty of fun. However, the story is a little over the top and James Newton Howard's score is a little dry."

The double-agent Colonel has three stars (Lieutenant General) on his epaulets, not a silver eagle. 2. Our heroine kills only bad guys: misinformed American agents, cops, and soldiers she merely kung-fu's unconscious (and they stay so throughout the particular scene). Deliberate? 3. Speaking of bad guys: they're all male - despite the background brainwashing scenes showing boys and girls. Ditto for the good guys: Jolie is the only female (who speaks more than 5 words) in the flick. Deliberate? 4.

"video1212","1","20","39","13 September 2010"," Dangerous movie to all POVs. SALT - one to avoid!
","First off, why am I dawdling with writing review for this disgusting piece of rotten sh*t called movie? Because it is dangerous to the extent of being put as a national enemy #1. I'll try to explain in short the reasons why.<br/><br/>For those of you historical illiterates, SALT means Strategic Arms Limitation Talks, these are diplomatic bilateral talks between US and Russia taking place between 1979-1986, US has withdrawn in 1986 with no explanation whatsoever. Since then many things happens, the most important of which is that the Soviets fall apart in 1991, there has been other agreements, called START, resulting in cutting each other's nuclear powers to the expectable minimum, there is no more USSR or other Communist reunion in Europe, with Commnism taking place in a handful of countries in Asia and the Carribeans. But that seems to avoid from the attention and knowledge of the Hollywood screenwriters. Hey you! Things has changed, Communism is no more, Cold War is over! Get it into your shabby heads once and for all, for Christ's sake! The main reason why this miserable and disgusting movie has been given green lit is to keep Joe the average American under the veil of fear. Make the illiterates and poorly educated average people fear and you've won them forever. You can then squeeze them for ages to pay all the military needs you have for empowering ""the nation"". Clever, but not enough. I hope there are still Americans who entrust more the common sense and loves to think instead of blindly believing what the media (cinema) says.<br/><br/>With that said, I must point out the most illogical moments in the movie which cause the whole tower of cards named screenplay to fall apart. First, it remains unclear why the Russian defector (played by Polish actor apparently) is pointing out his most valuable agent? In the movie at the end it's being said that Orlov was made to do so under pressure as to make the agent patsy so other agent can do the job. And it has been done because ... she might of become unstable because she fell in love with her husband when she was not supposed to. Bull sh*t! But the main point is - this is all pointless! Because there is no need to do so - since nobody in CIA knows a sh*t about the operation at all - hence no reason to display the assets in advance. Imagine what would have happened for example if Soviets, having second killer in hand, exposed say Lee Harvey Oswald a day before the assassination of JFK to CIA so they can have him as a patsy so the other agent can do the job? Nothing would've happened except maybe the CIA's CEO laughing their a**es off, then double, triple, 1000-le the president's security so no one can have a chance to ever take a glimpse on him, thus making the task completion impossible. More things on that subject, but I am limited in 1000 words, so...<br/><br/>Living in delusion is much more dangerous than living humble and sinless life. Take that in mind and do NOT watch this tripe."

","I have to say I'm tired of these women's lib action flicks. Here we have a 115 pound pretty girl jumping around killing about 100 bad guys (or good guys?). No I don't expect movies to be super realistic but this one is so over the top ridiculous that I couldn't enjoy it no matter how much mayhem they threw in front of my bored gaze. I constantly wanted to leave but it was hot in my apartment so I stayed and also because I didn't feel like going to bar and being insulted by unemployed chicks that believe in the trash Hollywood thinks we like but in reality hate. I was hoping for some intellectual intrigue but instead was delivered a pointlessly flip flopping plot to the point where I didn't even try to understand or give it the respect to care what I missed. So she was a good guy in the end? (Yeah she wants to be a guy.) What's was with the Chinese prison scene? Why should I care anyway? Maybe I'm done with movies for a while."

","(Plot) A deadly CIA agent is involved in a web of lies, and goes on the run after being accused of falsities. <br/><br/>Well. It's nothing outstanding, but it managed to get the job done for me during the 100 minutes or so. Salt has some pretty good suspense and some great action scenes as well. Angelina Jolie has proved she can be a formidable action hero when called upon. She did it in Tomb Raider, Wanted, and now Salt. I do have a qualm. It did start off a tad too slow for my liking, which made me think I was in for a mundane experience. Thankfully, the pace picked up quite a bit, and I was able to enjoy myself. Liev Schreiber is always a good addition to any film he's in, and I enjoyed him here. Salt also has great support with Chiwetel Ejiofor, Daniel Olbrychski, August Diehl, and more. <br/><br/>Final Thoughts: Adrenaline junkies like myself will probably find much to enjoy about this one like I did.

","SALT<br/><br/>Well... I was not expecting this to be that good.<br/><br/>The movie is about a CIA agent who interrogates a suspected terrorist... but when the terrorist says there is a spy amongst the CIA and he names her... she goes on the run to try and clear her name.<br/><br/>It is an action thriller and it delivers on both subjects. There is plenty of action, but not all of it was great. Yes it was entertaining but during some of the action sequences, it just felt too unrealistic. I know it is a movie and I know that it is not supposed to be real... but at points where you could see that the main character would not survive, it ruined it a little bit. Also, there was a scene where there was a huge car chase and a car crashes off of a bridge... someone climbs out of the car, undoes handcuffs and casually walks away without any of the 40 strong crowd even looking at her, let alone stop her.<br/><br/>But the surprise factor was there... and it was done very well. I tried to predict what was going to happen... and I failed. It is a great film for keeping you guessing. There was only one part of the movie that I guessed correctly, and even that I was not sure about.<br/><br/>The casting was brilliant... I can't fault anyone for their performances. Anjelina Jolie is the main character. I don't mind her, but I don't see her as the best actress in Hollywood like a lot of people do. She has made some fantastic movies though... and this in my opinion is one of her best. But I have to say I think the performance of the movie has to go to Liev Schreiber. This is by far the best performance he has done yet that I have seen. I mainly know him from the Scream movies which I love, and I have seen him in other things too... but he did a fantastic job in Salt.<br/><br/>The main thing I was disappointed with was the ending... I was comfortable watching this movie and really enjoying it... but it felt like it was unfinished. Honestly, the action was about to carry on, then the credits started to role. I was so confused and gutted. Thankfully, there are rumours of a Salt 2 on the way... hopefully they will finish the story this time.<br/><br/>All in all I loved this film. Yes there were things I was not too impressed with, but I was hooked from the beginning.<br/><br/>I will give this film 8 out of 10.<br/><br/>""How many more like you are there?""<br/><br/>For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:<br/><br/>https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl"
"ShootingShark","5","5","7","5 April 2013"," Agreeable But Undistinguished Action Thriller Of Renegade CIA Woman
","Evelyn Salt is an elite CIA agent whose world is turned upside down when a Russian defector claims that she is a KGB plant with a mission to assassinate the visiting Soviet president. Desperate and on the run, which side is she really working for ?<br/><br/>Salt is an enjoyable but by the numbers thriller, good on action and with a couple of nice story twists, but weak on characterisation and plotting. It works best when it's moving fast during three big set pieces - the extended car/foot chase sequence at the beginning, the assassination attempt in the cathedral, and the shootout in the nuclear bunker at the end. These scenes are fun, even if they do subscribe to a lot of classic Hollywood Science mistakes, the stuntwork is excellent, and ever-reliable James Newton Howard provides a great pounding score which gives the movie much more gravitas than it would otherwise possess. However, the story has some fairly gaping holes - why would Orlov blow Salt's cover (other than to kick-start the plot), what's the point in killing her husband (except to trigger the subsequent carnage), why does Salt kill Winter (when a captured agent would be much more useful alive), and so on. More importantly however, the cold ambiguity of Salt's character, necessary to keeping us guessing, gives Jolie (and everyone else) nothing to do emotionally, so we don't know whether or not we should identify with her. If she's pro-Russian she's a baddie, and if she's pro-American she's a thug who spends most of her time maiming her own side - is this a heroine ? It's a classic empathy problem with this type of story - I have a similar issue with Ingrid Bergman in Notorious - and it strips the film of most of the fun the action scenes generate. Movies have to be good stories first and foremost, and all too often this one teeters between dogmatic and risible. The subject matter of sleeper agents is interesting though - see also The House On 92nd Street or Little Nikita. A fair thriller, with plenty to enjoy for action and Angelina fans."

Folks, it's a movie. I didn't watch it to learn about the history of Russian-American relations. I watched and enjoyed it because it's engaging, entertaining, smart and enjoyable. I came away from this with unexpected, crafty surprises that left me guessing the whole time. It's good, and not just because of the action. It's well written IMO -like any good mystery.<br/><br/>That said, is it realistic? Of course not, and you have to set aside your realism for a while and just enjoy the show. I rolled my eyes several times, but so what? I still liked it. You know what else - it's categorized as an action/crime/mystery, but I think because of the lack of realism, it should also be billed as a fantasy movie.<br/><br/>I'm a Bourne fan, and I liked this too. Have you ever seen Equilibrium with Christian Bale? It's fantastic, but oh so totally unrealistic, but still have a 7.7 rating (currently). The fight scenes in that movie are unbelievable, literally, but still entertaining because I had not seen anything quite like it before. It's still very enjoyable with some great scenes - just like this movie."

Of Russian friends I have (all of which play COD: Black Ops) most of them agree it would be hands down cool if their was some Russian sleeper conspiracy, well guess what, THERE Isn't!! If everyone thinks that Hollywood's movies are racist, the should ask themselves, why on earth did they see SALT in the first place??????? They KNEW going into it that it would be a crazy Angelina Jolie Tomb Raider bonanza, but did they? NO!!!<br/><br/>I think the action was intense and the cast was great, Liev Schrieber probably should try different roles than the villain ones, but to his credit he's an amazing actor.<br/><br/>Lastly, the fight scenes....Angelina whoops butt, and yes I agree the entire movie was unrealistic, but this is 100000000000x better than Skyline...(which is completely unrelated but...still).

In a nutshell Jolie is accused of being a Russian spy and has to try and clear her name, as the film progresses you are left constantly guessing which side she really is on.<br/><br/>Sure in parts it becomes a little daft and in others totally unbelievable, and on occasions it was a bit confusing but there is more than enough decent action to make up for it. Russia is portrayed as your stereotypical Russia and likewise with the USA, but Salt isn't meant to be a factual documentary. <br/><br/>Angelina Jolie plays Evelyn Salt perfectly and really brings the character to life and Liev Schreiber played the bad-good guy quite well although nearing the middle of the film his character started to become quite predictable, but he worked well alongside Jolie.<br/><br/>It's impossible to dislike Jolie, she can actually act as well as play the heroine and Salt is a great film to sit and watching with a few beers on a Saturday night.<br/><br/>Criticizing Salt for not being realistic is like criticizing the journey to work for being too boring.<br/><br/>Salt is a solid 8/10 pushing 9/10 if you are really in the mood for an action film.

"Tweekums","7","6","9","21 February 2011"," Far fetched but contains plenty of excitement
","Salt is a fairly standard spy thriller; as it opens CIA agent Evelyn Salt is being freed from a North Korean prison and soon things are going well for her. Things turn worse though when a Russian agent walks in claiming that Salt is in fact a Russian sleeper agent planted many years previously. At first the CIA don't believe him but when Evelyn runs it looks as if he may have been telling the truth. As the drama progresses it look more and more likely that this is the case and her actions could start a war. She isn't the only potential sleeper agent and as the drama reaches its conclusion the viewer is left wondering whether Salt is an enemy agent trying to reach her target or whether she is in fact racing to protect the target from the true danger.<br/><br/>This wasn't a bad film but it did feel as though the creators though it was somewhat better than it really was; if they wanted to create a female Jason Bourne they didn't succeed. Angelina Jolie was good in the title role making the viewer believe in her character even though some of the stunts looked a little far-fetched. Other notable performances were Liev Schreiber as Salt's boss who appeared to keep his faith in her long after everybody else thought she was an enemy agent and Chiwetel Ejiofor as the secret service agent on her trail. If you want a bit of action with a few twists in it you could do a lot worse than this."
"beth-kenneh","9","22","45","11 August 2010"," Kick-ass movie
","I can't see why people are complaining, it wasn't a bad movie at all. Angelina Jolie is one of the best, if not, the best female to play an action role! The plot was believable, considering the KGB, although, to the extreme. The film had some good twists, can we say 'double agent'?? There is a lot of action, tasteful, without all the blood and vulgarity. Could have done with more of a background to Leiv's character and Salt's spider loving husband but hey ho, we can't have everything.<br/><br/>I also like the fact that the ending was left like that, leaves a sequel open to the hopes of Jolie coming back in full swing! We've not had a good action sequel, since 'The Bourne' saga and I fully welcome a female version. And no, this role shouldn't have been 'male filled', lets get real folks, women have been plotted as double agents throughout history, it's good to see it coming about in films.<br/><br/>This film is a modern day Mata Hari and well worth the time to watch."
"tasev1","9","19","38","30 July 2010"," A few issues don't bother me.
","I pretty much got exactly what I wanted out of this film, and thus I walked out quite satisfied. A female version of Jason Bourne, mixed in with a ""24""-style storyline and old cold-war movie nostalgia and some good plot twists made this action film great to watch. No matter how skinny Jolie may be (or how she may look in real life), Hollywood always makes her look pretty on the big screen - covered in blood or otherwise. HOWEVER, my biggest qualm IS Jolie - her size doesn't fit the role and the type of stunts she does. She certainly appears capable, but certainly not believable. I have to agree with an earlier comment, Michelle Yeoh would have been a better fit for this role (and a female lead in this film would surely have been more interesting than Tom Cruise).<br/><br/>In contrast, PERHAPS Inception may have been a better film and more successful at the box office, BUT I walked out far more satisfied after watching Salt than Inception."
"georgebush","10","19","38","25 July 2010"," audience cheered
","If you are looking for total realism stand at a bus stop for two hours. It's free. Seriously, I remember one of some well known critic's favorite films was of watching someone paint a painting for three hours. If you are looking for a film that is more James Bond than James Bond with a little Bourne thrown in then see Salt. But you will have to wait and see how this film turns out and who the real heroes are. The film is nothing like Shutter Island or Inception which were good but were psychological and mind bending films and are not thrillers. It is certainly nothing like Toy Story either which is a kid's film. There is no point to try and compare it to films that are not in the same genre. This is not a film for people preoccupied with gender, age, always trying to make a new concept or other things. It is a film full of imagination and excitement. It is great to see a film directed with no CGI. It is just done better, more interesting and was a surprise. Also, It is also interesting that a major Russian spy ring was broken up in the US this last month.<br/><br/>Jolie starts slowly and picks up speed like a railroad train. She is the best actress, hands down, of the era with films like this, Changeling, Mighty Heart and Beyond Borders. Jolie could get nominated for this film. She is completely versatile and pulls viewers with imagination into her films perhaps the best in Hollywood history over her career. Amazingly there is a major physical appearance change she makes in the film that I believe even her physical appearance at the Hollywood premiere was supposed to be slightly deceptive and made the movie physical change even more interesting. There was a point where I noticed early in the film that Jolie's face seemed so much slimmer than usual and not her usual self. After a scene regarding teeth, you will be surprised at a physical appearance change, . Then there was even another change later in the film. The film rocks and rolls and is quite the opposite of the image of mindless American girls on their cell phones 24/7 who have no individuality. In reality, this is an inspiring action packed performance. There is so much depth to her character, intensity, mystery, and excitement. It is written that way but only Jolie can bring it to life.<br/><br/>A subtle look from Jolie can mean so much. I believe it is Jolie's intelligence, knowledge of world affairs, and experience in foreign countries and war zones in real life that allows her to be so much more intense and interesting than most actors.<br/><br/>Great action thriller. The director did not feel the need to try and be falsely realistic by forcing lots of awkward swearing, pointless disturbing images or other phony realism that many modern films put in. This is not an art film, it is an action film, and an excellent one. Don't know if there will actually be a sequel. It had an exciting ending and could have kept going. It certainly could have a good sequel. I expected a lot going in and it was great. There is also a fine supporting cast. It is worth seeing on a full screen. I am not going to give away any twists and turns for those who have not seen this excellent movie. Man, it was like being there."

She did manage to charm everyone in her 'Lara Croft: Tomb raider' series. When I first saw the trailer of 'Salt' last year I was confident that this one is going to offer more than a typical popcorn flick, but I would say that I was disappointed.<br/><br/>The story was interesting in first half of the film but it started sagging from time to time in second half. The action sequences were eye catching but it was the lack of a tight script which made everything go in vain. The ending was neither convincing nor interesting. And one question remained unknown, whether Salt is a bad guy or a good guy? The police continuously chased her from first minute till the last minute. This no-brainer flick may attract viewers for a time pass but it fails to make any impact.<br/><br/>I felt pity on the director. After watching 'Inception' few days back, I was hoping that this movie won't disappoint me, but I did. Still I gave it 5 out of 10 because of good entertainment and a desperate try by Angelina Jolie. No other actors stood out except Liev Schreiber who gave a nice twist to the plot.<br/><br/>Final words, give 'Salt' a watch because of Jolie and its well performed action sequences. It may not be a classic action-spy movie but it delivers nice entertainment which won't disappoint most of the audiences."

People also might say, ""why does every movie have to be realistic, why can't movies just be good mindless fun""? Well they can be, however it works a lot better when the film actually takes you into another world such as Edward Scissorhands or Pan's Labyrinth, or if the film doesn't take itself so seriously, such as The Rundown or Die Hard. It also helps when the story is more than just a jumping board for cheap stunts and corny plot twists. Salt does not take us anywhere beyond the same old Hollywood garbage dump filled with lazy dialogue, plot twists that you can see coming for miles, boring characters and very few redeeming qualities at all. <br/><br/>Salt is pure action fluff meant only to fill the theatre seats with naive kids, waiting to see their over hyped super star Angelina Jolie kick some ass.

According to them, people need to relax and not take films so seriously. Well let me tell you this.

I'm sorry, but for my entertainment dollar I expect more than an overwritten and under thought reversion of The Roadrunner cartoon. The Roadrunner kicks the crap out of Salt any day, and why, because it was simple fun. Fluff action should always be simple fun, rather than overtly dumb.

Evelyn Salt is someone who uses her incredible skills like knowledge of weaponry and ability to jump from semi truck to semi truck on a freeway in the name of what is right and in the name of who had it comin. She seems unphased by how she is able to escape each impossible situation but rather looks at it as part of her job. She expects these desperate situations and thrives within them. This film is fast, exciting action, and anyone who wants a semi-docu-drama action flick which involves realistic pressing issues might want to try Syriana. Don't take this film too seriously, it's just a lot of fun."

","The movie was lame, very predictable. Jolie over acts, and I find her annoying. She is over exposed. Maybe a different cast could have saved this, who knows. Go see something else. Although predictable, it leaves some things unclear, as to her being in the White House especially. Many action scenes are violent but everyone is unscratched, to keep it to a PG-13 rating. I have no objection, then perhaps less violence and more brain work could have done this. A movie for the young for sure, and die hard Jolie fans who would watch anything she does. I thought she could easily be replaced with someone else. Not a lot of acting skill needed for this job."

","As a CIA officer, Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie) swore an oath to duty, honor and country. Her loyalty will be tested when a defector accuses her of being a Russian spy. Salt goes on the run, using all her skills and years of experience as a covert operative to elude capture. Salt's efforts to prove her innocence only serve to cast doubt on her motives, as the hunt to uncover the truth behind her identity continues and the question remains: ""Who Is Salt?"" All i have to say about this mess is ""Jolie decides to be an action hero and studio executives liked the idea so they blew over 100 million dollars to make Jolie look good"".

When I watched the movie last weekend and in my opinion it was one of Angelina Jolie's best performances! It was action packed, great and it kept you thinking the question that was on your mind from the moment you saw the trailer: ""Who is Salt?"" The ending was extremely unexpected, I can easily guess endings in movies but Salt was just like Shutter Island for me, not expecting the ending.

","I found this disappointing. True, it is fast paced, has exciting camera work and adrenaline rousing music. Also, Angelina Jolie is excellent in the action side of her role, although her acting was (for me) at best wooden despite the disguising of emotion being an integral part of the character.<br/><br/>However, the thoroughly implausible story, ridiculous characters, unnecessary female bashing, and similarity to plots in earlier films cited above rob this film of any classic attributes and will make it date quickly. For me this was not better than a Contractor type flick overall.<br/><br/>Maybe the big screen will provide escapist entertainment value, but unless someone else pays or you have a two for one ticket, wait for the DVD."

But you'll know, deep down, the choice was wrong. You've been duped.<br/><br/>From the first scene to the end of the movie, I hoped in vain for something that seemed credible or edgy or innovative or even just interesting.

","Hot girl who kicks everyone's ass goes on secret mission against incredible odds. Sound familiar? This movie is basically a carbon copy of ""Ultraviolet"" only with a Cold War theme.<br/><br/>I found it eerily like watching the 1960's version of Batman: Pow! Crash! Bang! Get him! Ooof! Crash! Pow! Slam! Only this time, it's a tiny woman slamming big, muscular men into the walls - without using martial arts. Yep, this tiny gal cleans everyone's clock by brawling like some drunk after getting cut off at the bar. At first, it's silly, but after a few scenes it becomes so ridiculous that you don't even laugh any more and just watch in embarrassment.<br/><br/>I'm thinking about buying the plot and selling it to people who have poor ventilation in their homes; all those holes would let in plenty of fresh air.<br/><br/>The spider venom thing was some of the most obvious foreshadowing I've seen in quite a while. It practically handed the movie's conclusion to the viewer on a platter. The questionable back-story didn't hold any water either. And then, suddenly, it turns into this nonsense about saving the world. Four words: Give Me A Break! It's almost as if the writer said, ""Let's cram every cliché'd device into this film!"" I got the impression I was watching a very high-budget student film made by a 13-year-old boy. Pathetic.<br/><br/>The flashbacks were particularly annoying. Apparently they were meant to give the Salt character emotional depth, but in actuality they seemed terribly contrived and very GI Joe cartoonish. Add to that Jolie's zombie-like, deadpan expression both pre- and post- flashback and you've got extreme ridiculousness. All they lacked was Celine Dion singing in the background.<br/><br/>If you enjoy mindless comic-book style entertainment, Salt will make your 'little General' stand up and salute. Otherwise, save your money and avoid this drek."
"thesar-2","3","17","36","25 July 2010"," Please Pass (on) the Salt
","Where Knight and Day actually did have intentional laughs, Salt produced more laughs that I didn't anticipate. Namely in the finale. Pretty much that was the only unpredictable factor in a movie with a climax that will go down in history as one of the most foreshadowed ""twists"" from minute one in the film.<br/><br/>Aside from the literal laugh-out-loud final 20 minutes, I don't think there was a scene in Salt that was crafted to invoke any laughter. This movie is as straight-laced without an ounce of humor, or humility, as one can make it.<br/><br/>Furthermore, aside from the unpredictable comedy and the predictable outcome, let's get one thing straight: if someone compares this to ANY of the Bourne movies, ask them this one simple question: What else have you lied to me about? This is as much Bourne as Ramona & Beezus is about lesbian lovers.<br/><br/>The title belongs on the popcorn you are eating as this is the main definition of a ""popcorn movie"" or Leave-Your-Brain-HOME film. Sure Angelina looked great and the action appeared to be CGI-lite – a favorite of mine, but it's hard to get past how incredibly mediocre both the script and action scenes were.<br/><br/>Perhaps they were trying to be realistic. They failed there with Salt's (Jolie) truck hopping, or lack of motion sickness after getting out of the 15th vehicle she caused to drop 1+ stories. Perhaps they were trying so hard on ""making you think"" with the is she/isn't she a single or double agent. Again, they let us down due to all the blatant clues they LITERALLY told us. I wouldn't be able to get through an entire season of the excellent 24 if they gave away 1/100 of the plot points in hour one as this did by minute five.<br/><br/>US-CIA Agent Salt was rescued by her husband Mike (Diehl) while tortured by the enemy and after that nearly, but not completely, pointless plot point, they fast forward two years to their happy home in D.C. This is all fun and games until a defective Russian confesses she's a Russian spy and her own kind turns on her.<br/><br/>Hold it there. I'll admit, I don't work for the CIA. I've not been known for my espionage tactics. But, it did sound a little fishy that one unknown would unravel an established agent in seconds and no one believes her. I couldn't buy that, but I'll just chalk that up as one of the many weak plot points to move the story to what it's really about: The Chase.<br/><br/>This is where people might compare this to Bourne as she's being chase by the same branch and she's out to solve her dilemma on her own. Well, that's been done dozens of times before. Jack Bauer, James Bond, Dr. Richard Kimble, to name a few. What the movie Salt needed to do, was separate itself, I don't know, with some original and exciting action sequences and less on trying to trap us in who's the mole.<br/><br/>To sum it all up, a Russian spy is, in fact, out to kill both the Russian and US Presidents and since Salt is their only suspect, they void any search of any other assassin. Could the culprit be pulling a Skynet? Sorry, I forgot to say SPOILER ALERT, but if you didn't see that coming or who's really responsible, then congratulations on your first movie you've seen since E.T.<br/><br/>Again, I'll admit Angelina looked wonderful, but this wasn't her day in the acting part. She was so up and down with real/fake emotions, she either made the director look bad or she took lessons from Megan Fox.<br/><br/>Every once in a while a movie will change my mind on an actor, much like my distaste for Nicolas Cage was thwarted a bit in Kick Ass or my annoyance with Adrien Brody was lifted in Predators. Didn't happen here with the actorI'veneverliked: Liev Schreiber. He didn't do anything, quite literally, in this movie. He was flat-lining out of the gate and did nothing to add to his character or movie. He was like Keanu Reeves who can tell you he's an FBI agent or he's a vampire hunter, but we never believe him due to his poor acting.<br/><br/>Who am I fooling? This movie's premise is just that, to fool you. It's not about acting, depth, originality or setting the bar higher. It's like an M. Night Shyamalan blunder whereas they were so concerned with the BIG surprise, they forgot to make a movie.<br/><br/>I'd barely recommend it for action alone and Angelia who did look good in her Matrix moves and clothes, but it's more of a rental. A cheap $1 rental. Or even on network TV in a year with dozens of commercials and scenes edited out."

"DavidAllenUSA","10","9","17","24 August 2010"," Salt (2010) is an updated version of La Femme Nikita (1990)
","Salt (2010 Columbia) starring Angelina Jolie and directed by Philip Noyce is a duplication and update of a well done French classic movie make in 1990 titled La Femme Nikita (1990 France) starring Anne Parillaud and directed by Luc Beeson.<br/><br/>See the ""Alternatiave Ending"" version of this movie.....it's better, makes better sense, should have been chosen as the ""primary"" or ""main"" version of the movie released to movie houses. The Alternative version ending is very intelligent and satisfying in a way the ""official,"" ""main"" version of the movie is not. Nuff said!<br/><br/>Well....more about that....(to drive the point home!)......<br/><br/>The ""Alternative Ending"" version of ""Salt"" (2010) available on DVD's with several variations of the movie is the best one, and all interested in the great ""Salt"" movie should see that version, rather than the version which was released to the movie houses in 2010, and which is the ""default"" ""official,"" and ""main"" version viewers see unless they visit the ""special features"" section of the DVD of ""Salt"" and choose the ""alternative ending.""<br/><br/>To get back to the comparison of ""Salt"" (2010) with ""La Femme Nikita"" (1990), both movies are about beautiful females who look like high fashion ramp models, both unusually underweight with exotic faces and thick, sensuous lips, who are recruited, manipulated, forced to become government assassins, and who murder many innocent people in cold blood 'doing their job"" during the course of the story and the movie, but in the end ""jump ship"" and escape from their government manipulator puppet-masters, and disappear at the end of both movies to an unknown and uncertain future....the price both women pay for escaping from their roles as forced government assassins.<br/><br/>Both movies demonstrate and assert that the classical ""femme fa tale"" may be part of a story which has almost nothing to do with romance or connection with any male, and also that the female protagonist in an action/ mystery story (both Salt and La Femme Nikita are action/ mystery stories) can be capable of astonishing feats of physical prowess and strength against male antagonists in which the female wins physical fights and the males lose....repeatedly.<br/><br/>Both Angelina Jolie as ""Evelyn Salt"" in SALT and Anne Parillaud (one of the top fashion models in France before she became a movie star) as ""Nikita"" retire from the stories both star in ""undefeated"" in all serious contests they engage in....the men they come up against always lose, the female protagonists always win.<br/><br/>The female protagonists never face female antagonists in either movie, which is significant.<br/><br/>The Salt (2010) movie uses a lot of tricky editing and fast paced cutting to assist Angelina Jolie 'do her thing"" beating up men and doing Harrison Ford style action miracles which would easily kill most people....<br/><br/>The La Femme Nikita (1990) movie is smoother, and more believable for that reason, and probably the better of the two movies for that reason.....it is much less a ""video-game"" Dark Knight type movie, relies far less on gimmicks and technical/ digital tricks.....<br/><br/>Salt (2010) starring Angelina Jolie lacks the needed humorous and human intervals provided in La Femme Nikita (1990). The main female character in Salt (2010) is much less lovable and far more driven...she really does stay ""on task"" and is almost a machine as military ideal soldiers are supposed to be. Women may or may not be capable of all the superstar action and heroic stunts Angelina Jolie performs as the ""Evelyn Salt"" character, but such ladies are like the napkins neatly folded for wedding anniversaries Angelina Jolie (""Salt"") comments on at the start of the movie...""Not too sexy."" How true, how true.<br/><br/>But Salt is a good movie worth seeing....so, of course is/was La Femme Nikita (1990).<br/><br/>The DVD disc version for home viewing I bought included three different versions of the movie, including an ""extended cut"" which showed and alternative ending and at least one key part earlier in the movie changed to fit the alternative ending. I can see why the version ultimately released in movie houses and offered as the ""official version"" was chosen. The released version (the ""official"" one) is more logical, and the ending is closer to La Femme Nikita (1990 French). <br/><br/>Both Salt (2010) and La Femme Nikita (1990) examine the potential and unexpected physical and mental power of beautiful females built like super-models one sees on Vogue Magazine covers, and almost never in Hollywood (or French) action movies.<br/><br/>Both are good movies. We need more just like them....odd that it took 20 years for Salt (2010) to pick up where La Femme Nikita (1990) left off.<br/><br/>--------<br/><br/>Written by Tex Allen, SAG Actor.

","It's a credit to Jolie's star power that she was offered the part of Evelyn Salt – originally conceived as Edwin Salt – after Tom Cruise pulled out of the production, however it's a testament to her talent and hard work that she delivers a powerhouse performance that makes it hard to imagine the role as a man. Jolie is front and centre of this enigmatic film, the success of this thriller relying solely on her mysterious nature, and she comes up trumps. Whilst it's pleasing to see her convince in the hard-hitting action scenes – some of the close-quarter combat is brutal – her genuine acting chops carries the movie to another level. When you think you have her pinned as either good or bad, a small look here or a change in tone there completely trips you up and you're straight back into ambiguous territory.<br/><br/>Jolie is helped immensely by crafty direction from Australian filmmaker Phillip Noyce, this marking the second time they've paired up (both times successfully) after working together on The Bone Collector. Noyce shoots in such a manner that the dark evasiveness of the proceedings are emphasised and the audience's pre-conceived notions of the picture are utilised against them. The situation presented on paper may be familiar, the method in which we're thrown in to witness it on screen is entirely dissimilar though. There's no easy choices to be made, no neatly wrapped conclusion, the opening scene warns you of this instantly.<br/><br/>There's plenty of excellence elsewhere too. Director of photography, Robert Elswit, boosts the ominous atmosphere with his dusty cinematography as James Newton Howard provides an immensely exciting original score that captures the to-and-froing storyline perfectly. Schreiber and Ejiofor round out the trio of known actors on the cast list, the latter establishing himself as a major star of the future with yet another thriving turn. Appearing opposite Jolie isn't always easy going thanks to her gargantuan star-wattage, however the class of these two supporting men ensure they have a part to play in the striking accomplishment of Salt.<br/><br/>Rock solid entertainment.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)"

","In my opinion, Angelina Jolie is one of the most beautiful women alive in the world today. As an actress, she has played so many different roles and all so well that she could recite the alphabet and I would be enthralled and intrigued.<br/><br/>All of this is to say that she very well plays the role of a super-spy CIA agent in this action/suspense/spy movie. Adding to the value of this enjoyable movie is the fact that her love interest is a very average looking guy (yeah, and a world-renowned scientist). I'll freely admit that I (an average looking guy) am attracted to movies where the gorgeous woman is devoted to such a guy.<br/><br/>Jolie is accused of being a ""sleeper"" KGB agent and the movie unfolds to reveal what happens next.<br/><br/>And what happens next involves amazing chase scenes, satisfying action sequences, and enough plot twists to make sure that even a non-Angelina fan will remain enthralled and intrigued. There have been enough posts about the plot weaknesses in this movie so I won't go there. Action movies generally require a certain amount of suspension of disbelief but this one clearly requires more. Suffice it to say that this is why my rating was 8/10 rather than 10/10.<br/><br/>If you are waiting for Jolie to make a third Lara Croft Tombraider film then check out this movie. If you expect your action movies to actually make some sense then watch this one only if you are a Jolie fan."

People keep saying that it isn't realistic, but movies are meant to take you on a journey somewhere, through someone else's life.

","Apparently 2010's ""Salt"" was intended for Tom Cruise, but was rewritten for a woman when he backed out. The story is about a CIA agent, Evelyn Salt, who spends time in a prison in North Korea and only is released because of the nonstop efforts of her boyfriend (August Diehl), whom she marries.<br/><br/>Ready to leave the office to celebrate their anniversary, Salt is asked to help interrogate a spy (Daniel Olbrychski) who has information and wants to defect. The spy, Orlov, claims that the Russian president will be assassinated at the vice-president's funeral by one of the many agents who were infiltrated into the American system by Russia: Evelyn Salt.<br/><br/>Salt claims this is absurd, but seeing the looks on the faces of her boss (Liev Schreiber) and Secret Agent Peabody (Chiwetel Ejiofor), Salt realizes that they are going to keep her at the agency and question her. Desperate to reach her husband for fear he's been liquidated, Salt breaks out and escapes. What follows is a breathless chase that has Salt scaling buildings from the outside, jumping onto trucks, blowing up offices, and killing.<br/><br/>Directed by Phillip Noyce and written by Kurt Wimmer, this is an incredible action film on the same level as one of the ""Bourne"" movies, done at a lightning fast pace. Jolie, who did most of her own stunts, is remarkable as a tough, clever, resourceful, and athletic agent.<br/><br/>The film moves so quickly that one is tempted to overlook some of the plot holes. If I like a movie, as I did here, I let them slide, as I will now, but I need to point them out because they're pretty glaring. The first one is, how is it possible that the CIA, for corn's sake, has no idea that Orlov, the spy who wants to defect, has a knife hidden in his shoe? The second one is far worse -- when Peabody tells Salt that no one will believe her story of what happened in the activation room, one wonders how this is possible. There are cameras in the hallways, the elevators, in the deepest recesses, yet in a room where an activating device for a nuclear attack is located, and where the President of the United States has to be to put in the code -- no cameras? No way to see what went on? Please! I'm sure there are others, and I realize the entire story is preposterous, but for me, this was a little too much dramatic license. I did love it, and I can't wait for the sequel. I hope there is one."

Director Phillip Noyce tries, but there's only so much he can do with the material, and his only sillier tendencies also get in the way.<br/><br/>In the end, ""Salt"" is barely worth a look, but it's actually the least satisfying of the major action films of summer 2010.

","I would have given it a 6.5 if there was a way to do it but I rounded up. The action scenes were definitely the weak point because it isn't a cartoon like Lara Croft. Angelina is simply too frail and unathletic to be Ms Jason Bourne. It was like watching adult males being tossed around by a 12 year old and she did it for the entire movie. They could have written around the physical scenes better. Aside from that it was a nice bit of cold war suspense and the strong cast did the best that they could. It wasn't utterly predictable and it is not a copy of the Bourne Identity. The role was written for a male lead but they did a nice job in adapting it for a female. I hope it does well enough in the box office to support a sequel because it was a decent popcorn movie."

Someone said she was unbelievable because she was a skinny chick beating up strong men. Give me a break. It's an action film not a documentary and besides what's wrong with having women do fun action movies like the guys. Hooray for Maggie Q; Kate Beckinsale; Milla jovich.

I was able to guess some part of the story a bit too ahead which is also OK as its hard for that not to happen in these kind of movies.<br/><br/>The scene where she uses her panties to cover the camera was really cheesy and ultra dumb. It was like just to make ""Angelina Jolie"" take her panties off in the movie which might kindle some whispers around. Sorry not for me, she could have easily broke the camera lens or the camera itself in half the time she spent taking her panties off.<br/><br/>The biggest plus point of the movie was the slightly different touch to the standard spy story compared to the ones we have around already in recent times. This gave some decent surprises which made up for the part I had guessed already.<br/><br/>Bottom line: Good entertainment."

","In a summer where many movies have more or less been considered disappointments, it's nice to see a film that delivers the goods as much as ""Salt"" does.<br/><br/>As an action thriller that's almost as quick with its pacing as its heroine is on her feet, more probably happens in ""Salt's"" 90 minutes than in ""Robin Hood's"" nearly two and a half hour running time. Not that I am trying to argue that all summer blockbusters should have reasonably short running times, but sometimes, you just want to have action and thrills, not extended scenes of dialogue. ""Salt"" definitely gives you just that, but it also manages to fit a brain into its script, too.<br/><br/>The plot can be explained quickly: Salt (Angelina Jolie, on yummy mode) is a CIA agent who's considered one of the best in the field. Then one day--on her wedding anniversary of all days--a Russian comes in to spill one heck of a story: His native country has been taking Americans and replacing them with Russian spies. These spies have been trained since childhood to prepare for a day called ""Day X,"" in which all of them will be ""activated"" to bring down America, starting by killing Russia's president (it's a very complicated plan). As anyone who has seen the trailer already knows, he claims that Salt is one of these agents.<br/><br/>Rather than wait for interrogation, Salt chooses to run. And on that note, I will not say anything more about the film's plot, because much of the fun here comes from trying to figure out whether or not Salt's a good spy or a bad spy. Has she been framed? Is she actually a double agent? These questions aren't answered right away in the story, and while I was proud of myself for being able to guess the ending before I got there, everything about Salt as a character isn't completely clear until the final scenes of the film.<br/><br/>While we question Salt's loyalty, we are treated to some really effective action sequences. While I appreciated ""Knight and Day"" for its tongue-in-cheek tone, it's been quite some time since we've had a ""serious"" action movie in theaters. Seeing Angelina as Salt run, shoot and fight her way through the film's plot is nothing short of exciting. It's also all kinda, well, sexy. Indeed, for better or for worse, ""Salt"" has clearly been made with Jolie's male viewers in mind. There's a reason other than just the story that she spends an entire chase sequence barefoot, with the same reason being behind her being handcuffed for a hair-raising car chase that takes place later in the film.<br/><br/>Jolie is obviously aware of her sexual appeal, and she uses it well without ever making it exploitive. She makes Salt seem sympathetic one moment and incredibly deadly the next, allowing for some of her acting skills to come into play in-between the various set pieces. Regardless of whether we trust her or not, we root for Salt as she goes on her adventures largely because Angelina is so compelling...even at points where she really does appear to be a traitor.<br/><br/>""Salt"" is brisk, fun, smart and action-packed, but it can also be described with another word, a word that I've been able to use on way too few movies this year. It's refreshingly, gloriously badass."

","Salt is a turn off from beginning to end. Anjelina is past it as an action heroine. Her credibility ended (if there was any doubt) with the movie 'Wanted'. The fight scenes in 'Salt' are WOEFUL and completely unbelievable even by Hollywood standards. The shots were TOO tight (as if trying to hide the fact the fact that choreography was RUBBISH) <br/><br/>The plot (imagine Bourne meets Wanted) is irrelevant because you never believe Ms Jolie's character is credible. You feel like what it is, an Actor near the end of their career getting a quick pay day and they don't care if you know it. She doesn't even look good any more so the eye candy or Worthers Originals factor in Ms Jolies case can't carry a turkey of a movie like this any more.

In this case they couldn't even be bothered to concoct a fresh plot, as yet another megalomaniac clique plans to start World War 3 by assassinating the US and Russian presidents. The genre was mercilessly satirized by the Austin Powers franchise more than a decade ago, and this ludicrous example insults everybody above the mental age of twelve.<br/><br/>The story makes little sense, as the attempt at world domination by group of power-crazed conspirators is foiled by one of their own mole triple agents. The film's conveyor belt of action sequences is clearly the point of the exercise, as the stunt doubles of an anorexic Jolie spend almost two hours jumping from roof to roof of various speeding vehicles, and vanquishing hundreds of heavily armed assailants. The public seems to possess an insatiable appetite for escapist fantasies, and garbage like 'Salt' allows a cynical industry to take their money and laugh at them behind their backs."

","Evelyn Salt is an agent for the US government – highly trained and highly effective. However, when a Russian defector brings news of children raised in Russia as Americans and placed into the US as sleeper agents in all manner of powerful positions, Salt is one of those named. Knowing she is innocent, Salt's first thought is to ensure her husband is safe and, unable to do so from the custody of her employers, flees – essentially admitting her guilt in the eyes of Agent Peabody, even if her boss Ted Winter is adamant of her innocence.<br/><br/>The plot of Salt appears to be the standard stuff of a highly trained special agent out on their own trying to clear their name while being hunted by their own people. To its credit it is a bit more twisty and turny than that and it does make it more engaging that if it had just been played straight out. This is not the same as me saying it all works though, because to be honest if you sit down and look at it in the cold light of day there is a lot in the plot that doesn't make a whole lot of sense. In particular there are narrative-conveniences that are done for the sake of it even if they are incredibly unlikely. The thing is though, the film carries them and, while you may easily pick holes in it, the chances are that the majority of viewers will be doing this after the film rather than during it.<br/><br/>It is not just the specific action sequences that do it but rather the overall tone and pace of the film. It is slickly made and delivered over 90 minutes so that there is no time for the viewer to ruminate on specifics – instead we are whisked to the next twist or next moment. Living in the moment is the action/thriller film's friend and it works well in Salt, making it fun and quite urgent while you are watching it. Of course a lot of it doesn't make sense and normally I would be the first to call nonsense on such a film, but somehow Salt makes it work.<br/><br/>Having a banner star is essential and, although I'm not a fan of Jolie, she does have a screen presence (quite how considering how stick thin she is, but she does it). She doesn't quite deliver on the potential of her character here as she only lets a humanity come through now and again, opting instead to mostly go with ""sexy indestructible spy"", which is less effective and has been done to death for all but the most libido-led teenage boys. Schreiber and Ejiofor are both strong in support and add a weight to the film that it definitely benefits from. The rest of the cast are solid enough but the presence of Andre Braugher is a mystery to me – such a good actor and well-known face but yet here he is on screen for a few seconds and barely two sentences to say.<br/><br/>Salt is not a brilliant film by any means and the sequel-friendly ending didn't have me excited to see the character more, but yet I enjoyed the film while I watched it. The slick delivery and strong pace help cover up the plot holes and convenient narrative devices and generally it is fun. Best enjoyed in a genre friendly setting such as the summer blockbuster season or as a Friday night DVD though as it is probably not strong enough to play well away from home turf."

","Angelina proves once again she can kick ass and looking great doing it. The plot kicks off almost immediately and leaves little to the imagination, save for the word of a Russian outcast and the subsequent knee-jerk reaction from Salt and the US government.<br/><br/>After that, we're led on some really defy-defying chases through highways and rooftops. Jolie's character is so complex it does truly live up to the tagline floating around for months. The twists and re-twists are interesting to say the least, along there is sometimes a case of one too many, but the cast makes it work. The two supporting members, Ejofor and Schreiber, are very good at playing the eccentric and the straight and narrow, respectively. The direction is fine, as it moves at a brisk pace while sprinkling more facts and secrets while unraveling Salt's past. Overall, this is a good vehicle for Jolie and she makes the most of it.<br/><br/>BTW, what's up with giving the (mostly good) Andre Braugher like 2 lines? He must've really need a paycheck."

","In thinking about this movie afterward I was left with the impression that this movie could arguably be labeled ""a female version"" of the Bourne Identity. I would disagree slightly with this characterization however in that there are some worthwhile distinctions.<br/><br/>This film is at least slightly (if not more so) darker than Bourne in my opinion, and to me that makes this film touch home more.<br/><br/>Jolie also does a very admirable job with her non verbal expressiveness. Because of this and because of the fact that the writing gives us good insight into her back story, I found myself more enmeshed with this character than with Bourne (don't get me wrong – Damon did a great job – it is just that I liked the overall ""taste"" of Salt more).<br/><br/>Even though the action sequences are extreme, they were surprisingly not over the top for me. The movie flowed well and ended in a satisfying manner. In the end, I really liked the Salt character and would prefer her to another Bourne movie, though I think the two are quite comparable overall."
"tedg","Null","10","21","25 July 2010"," Salting the Mines
","Two things are of interest to me here.<br/><br/>One is the growing demand we have for plot twists. We expect to be presented with the unexpected. I think this is a direct evolution from how the detective story entered the film vocabulary. In its pure form, it is an engagement of discovery with the viewer, usually in collaboration with an on screen character. We might ""solve"" the puzzle by creating the narrative before the film does.<br/><br/>This is a ""fold"" that engages the viewer more intensely than otherwise, simply because of the investment. Over time, a branch appeared where the viewer was not expected to guess. Clues and red herrings ceased to be placed. The game was not played. The enjoyment of the movie was in creating a baffling set of facts that were ""explained"" at the end. Our thrill comes from the pleasure of making sense out of the nonsensical. This branch has many more examples than the more directly engaging one. <br/><br/>I hesitate to say it is less intelligent, because we infuse anything with narrative depth. In this branch, the intelligence comes in being presented with more and more complex solutions. The ""explanation"" at the end takes on its own mini-narrative where the initial solution is proved to be yet another level of deception.<br/><br/>I believe this is the yearning we have to be engaged. <br/><br/>The second interesting thing here is the obvious re-invention of gender roles. Female pop singers are pulling the center of female roles more toward the openly sexual and seductive. The action movie's response is the leather clad kickass woman. The woman on top. The sexual being that is in control. This started first, I believe, in revenge movies where the woman has been raped, so the response is justified. <br/><br/>Then we moved into an era where women were fit into samurai-like cartoon figures. This is the scowling, leather dominatrix mode, or alternatively less realistic mode. The extreme is anime where the female is a teen girl in a magical universe where exposed body parts matter. To the best of my knowledge, we have never had a woman — acting as a real women — in this genre. <br/><br/>By that I mean a true noir character, not someone winking at the camera. The closest we came that I remember is Geena Davis in her Renny Harlan periods, but they still were based in humor and in any case failed at the box office. However, we were all aware of Geena's Mensa status and her prior life playing flurry, sexually available characters.<br/><br/>Only Angela could do what she has done here. I understand that the script was written for Tom Cruise and very little changed with the gender shift. Our Angel allows herself to be photographed looking unattractive. Until the very end, she is not her normal seductive self. Never in the entire thing are we aware of her body. At one point, she is effectively disguised as a man.<br/><br/>I'm not one to pick celebrities and follow them like some follow sports teams. But I do believe that this woman carries a lot of responsibility for how a generation of girls will think of themselves. I think she did this in part because of some awareness of that archetype- bending power.<br/><br/>And there is the challenge. Like the fundamental changes within the story where ""people"" are not as we believed, the slots for people are shifted as well in the larger story in which we live.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."

","CIA agent Evelyn Salt interrogates a Russian defector, Orlov, who tells her about ""Day X"", an operation organized by a powerful Russian since the Cold War, which will lead to the destruction of the United States. Orlov mentions that at the funeral of the late Vice President in New York City, the visiting Russian President will be killed by Russian spy Evelyn Salt. Salt, shaken at the accusation, attempts to contact her husband Mike, a German arachnologist, fearing for his safety.

It seemed right up my alley. Something about sexy girls kicking ass, maybe? Unfortunately, Salt disappointed me. Not that it's a terrible film but it's average at best. The premise is great and holds a lot of potential but it evolves into something completely ridiculous and over the top. The plot is so flimsy, so far-fetched that, if you're going into this film expecting a smart, well-constructed story, then you're going to be just as disappointed as me.

"DICK STEEL","7","7","14","6 August 2010"," A Nutshell Review: Salt
","It's Infernal Affairs at a national level, where instead of cops and robbers playing spy versus spy through the planting of moles in each other's operations, this one ups the ante with countries planting sleeper cells of spies in others, waiting for opportunities to strike when given the cue. It's something like The Manchurian Candidate (which starred Liev Schreiber too) as well, although here the operatives are fully aware of what they're in for. And it's not as far- fetched a plot as one would think, because as what had surfaced quite recently, there were after all, Russian spies who eat, breathe and live American in a typical neighbourhood, not drawing attention to themselves, and able to assimilate into society effortlessly.<br/><br/>The million dollar question here is really whether Angelina Jolie's Salt, is a hero, anti-hero or plain villain, in this action-espionage tale directed by Philip Noyce who at one time helmed some of the Jack Ryan movies starring Harrison Ford, so political intrigue, and spy stories are right up his alley. Also, writer Kurt Wimmer had given us stories such as Law Abiding Citizen, The Recruit, adapted Street Kings, and written-directed Equilibrium and Ultraviolet, so we'd know what we're in for with his better films balancing action and drama, while duds like Ultraviolet had its action sequences to thank to get us through a boring plot.<br/><br/>But thank goodness it is precisely that keeping us guessing, coupled with some nicely designed action sequences that made this film palatable. Tom Cruise was once attached to the project before he ran away, because well, this film featured a lot of running, which Tom has done to death so many times in his films. In comes Angelina Jolie and the story rewritten to accommodate a sex change, and yes, Jolie excels in her alpha-female, no-nonsense kick- butt role as a woman hunted by her colleagues when fingered by a Russian defector to be a Russian spy. And really with her being the marquee name, Salt relies very much on her charisma and indestructible best to engage the audience in her adventures involving assassination and new world order type of subplots.<br/><br/>Which will leave you guessing just where her allegiance is drawn, since we see her working undercover for the CIA as a field operative together with Schreiber's Ted Winter, and whom Chiwetel Ejiofor's Peabody of their counter-terrorism unit wants to reign in for questioning after that iota of suspicion was raised. That forms the crux of the film stringing together action sequence after action sequence, some just the plain ol fisticuffs, while others are quite unique such as the driving of a car via Tazer. Yes, you read that right. And one of my favourite scenes involved Salt at her acrobatic best at finishing off a rival at the finale, which is effective, but highly brutal.<br/><br/>The flashback that tells of the origins and motivation of these spies was quite intriguing, and makes you wonder if there's some truth to it, since one really needs to churn out assembly lines of operatives with rock solid allegiance so as to survive living in a new environment. Not all will make it, especially with being constantly bombarded on a daily basis by all things alien, and running the risk of Love coming into the picture, which the film suggests is a powerful emotion able to tame the wildest of hearts. And if you don't buy this concept at all, then you'll probably don't buy into this film.<br/><br/>I suppose if the film does well, there may be sequels or even a spin off television series since Noyce and Wimmer left things open-ended deliberately for room to develop Salt's world further."

But why is she running from the good guys? And punching and kicking and killing them and being a total bad-ass?

However, it was pretty clear who the good guys and bad guys were, so only a matter of time until they did what they were supposed to do and the audience could move on. Worth looking for in the bargain bin or watching on TV."

","what went wrong,this is the question that kept pumping in my head after watching this movie.<br/><br/>(Phillip Noyce) directed THE BONE COLLECTOR,(Kurt Wimmer)wrote STREET KINGS,(Angelina Jolie) is a mega superstar & she had a solid cast.<br/><br/>the film had all the elements to be totally rocking but it didn't. the script is weak & fragile that we reach a point wondering what is going on,things are not that naive & the sequence of events does not make a lot of sense.the character of SALT is not a superhero,she is not a superwoman nor a cat woman so a lot of the action & the sequence of events in the film is not acceptable nor believable. the action scenes were well directed & the visual effects were good.(Jolie) & Liev Schreiber were good. i don't know if the reason is that i just watched INCEPTION before SALT but i expected something better."

","Salt is thriller/action movie with a lot of twists and turns. Jolie plays an agent that seemingly was setup by her adoptive country. This movie definitely keeps you guessing up until the very end. The storyline is interesting and the acting is acceptable. Liev Schreiber does great along side Jolie. Chiwetel Ejiofor did fine but seemed to overact at times. He needs to show balance as he did in ""talk to me"". The movie has its dramatic moments but it failed at making the action scenes believable. Watching Jolie jump from semi to semi on a highway, slide down elevator shafts with ease and watch her beat up and push grown men aside like toys is just ridiculous. This is a thriller/action movie not a scifi superhero flick. But other than that is was a good movie. I recommend waitting for it on DVD rather then see it in the movies."

","OK so I wasn't expecting a a complex thriller full of intricacy and intrigue, I was however expecting a semi decent action film with a few pay-off scenes and maybe even some snappy dialogue.....how wrong I was.<br/><br/>As other reviewers have alluded to there is an air of the Bourne films about this story, although at no point is it suggested that Salt has forgotten anything about her past, but it's a real low-rent copy. The fight scenes don't have the realism of Bournes encounters where you can practically feel the bones cracking and it seems a bit ludicrous that Salt is able to take down any opponent she comes across, such as fellow CIA team members who I would suppose have had the same training as her, based on the fact that she received some ""extra"" training in Russia as an 8 year old child.<br/><br/>Other than this the story is very weak, the reason for her dilemma about who to serve is to never really explained other than with a few half hearted flashbacks and the ""twists"" are so predictable as to be obvious within the opening few minutes.<br/><br/>The disappointing thing is that there were the ingredients here for a good film, Russia vs America, double agents and a strong female lead character who doesn't resort to stripping down to her undies to get the job done. Unfortunately the execution was poor at best.<br/><br/>The ending (when it finally came) left it open for a sequel and if it was done properly then maybe they could squeeze a good film out of it but I doubt it."

This weekend, we were again racking our brains.....but this time, we were trying to make some sense of the plot which seemed to be heading here, there and everywhere.<br/><br/>The first half of the movie was restricted to Evelyn Salt running, cops (or CIA or FBI or whoever) chasing her, running, chasing, running and chasing. While those stunts could have made hearts miss beats about forty years ago, there was nothing new about them.<br/><br/>Just when you thought that's all the movie had to offer, it took a whole new look - suddenly it was all about assassinating heads of states, and even more amusingly, about nuclear holocausts. If this was what the movie was supposed to be about, why did we have to watch one hour of Salt-on-the-run stunts? It could have been made a lot better if the director had concentrated on the political thriller side of it.<br/><br/>There also seemed to be a lot of impossibilities: Evelyn Salt getting into the underground chamber beneath the White House single handedly, making it look too easy. Ted Winter barely had to bat an eyelid to have the President hostage. I do not know what is the procedure to launch a nuclear attack, but if it was indeed the way it was shown in the movie, sabotaging it seemed to be a piece of cake, the way Ted did. And in the end, though Peabody helped Salt escape, it seemed highly improbable that somebody suspected of preparing to launch a nuclear war would be ferried in a chopper like a common criminal, with just one officer keeping watch on her.<br/><br/>A rating of 5 is justified for the action sequences and the background score, but there's nothing else in the movie. Inception had left everybody hankering for more, but Salt has killed that desire."

The action is more-or-less high paced, but needs to be much smarter. A climactic fight becomes laughable with a supposed computer program controlling a nuclear arsenal taking a full 15 min to authorize is clunky and dodgy.

The portrayal of Russians is both laughable and insulting - all packing automatic weapons, calling each other ""Comrade"" and swigging down Vodka like a bunch of loser idiots stuck in some eighties Soviet time warp. The storyline is illogical and unbelievable at every turn. I cannot believe someone actually wrote this junk, someone else actually funded this junk, and people directed and acted in it as well.

However when former Russian spy Vasily Orlov (Daniel Olbrychski) turns himself in to uncover a conspiracy spanning several decades - special underground units are raised from youth to infiltrate American soil from deep within and soon they will be called upon to assassinate the Russian president. When Vasily names Salt as one of these supposed agents she is soon on the run, followed closely by CIA agent Ted Winter (Liev Schreiber) and home security operative Peabody (Chiwetel Ejiofor).<br/><br/>With this action packed spy thriller Phillip Noyce attempts to create a female counterpart for Matt Damon's brilliant Jason Bourne. Evading capture via simple ingenuity, touch-on creativity as well as the occasional fighting dominance, Salt wriggles out of seemingly hopeless situations. Done with a spark for action, the script by Kurt Wimmer (""Equilibrium"", ""Total Recall"") doesn't afford as much believability, instead being culpable of what could be deemed deus ex machina. The dosage of suspension of belief far outdoes any of the Bourne trilogy, fronted by what unravels to be an unassailable plot spurned into action by a pretty rag-tag master-plan. Angelina Jolie does manage to instill some level of coherence to her spy persona, making Salt a pretty credible character with due promise for further sequels. Noyce as well manages to follow through with resolve, especially during a tension filled first half of the movie, where Salt's identity is yet to be truly revealed.

Angelina Jolie performed excellently in her role as Salt, and kept consistency throughout her role in the film. Although the action sequences in this movie were quite unreal, such as jumping from a helicopter into the sea, or jumping from one truck to another and almost entirely unhurt, it was entertaining to see this world of fast-paced action on screen. Evelyn Salt's determined attitude also captivated my full attention during this movie.

In each case the film's hero is on the run, falsely accused of a crime which he or she must solve whilst being pursued. The entire ""running man"" plot is itself a MacGuffin, our hero jumping from set piece to set piece as he or she attempts to piece together his puzzle.<br/><br/>The good thing about this formula is that you don't need expensive set pieces or elaborate stories. The plot itself generates tension; the actors need only ride the wave. Amusingly, almost all of these films find a way of fitting in a scene in which the good guys and bad guys face off through a (usually bullet proof) glass wall or door. As the genre revolves around heroes in flight from pursuers, the only way to get the two dramatically together and not have the film end is to slip a piece of glass in between them.<br/><br/>The film's plot is inconsequential – dated Cold War nonsense, in which actress Angelina Jolie saves the world from nuclear annihilation – but that doesn't matter.

","A Russian defector, under interrogation by the CIA, exposes one of the agency's top operatives--a beautiful blonde veteran--as a Russian spy; she maintains her innocence, but escapes security anyway to warn her husband of the impending danger. Is she a spy, trained by the Russkies as a child into overthrowing the US government--and if so, where do her sympathies lie after her husband is abducted? Cold War revisionist balderdash, 'written by' Kurt Wimmer though seeming cobbled together from various (and familiar) action-adventure clichés. In the lead, Angelina Jolie shows up; she narrows her eyes in suspicion, she purses her famous lips in concentration. After rolling off an overpass onto a semi, Jolie's extraordinarily lucky Evelyn Salt is grazed by a bullet yet still manages to leapfrog through heavy traffic, later riding a police van off another overpass onto a taxi-cab (where she ridiculously walks away, unnoticed and unharmed). There's no logic to the film (not even crazy logic), and a character twist in the extended final reel is predictable. Those of us who were rooting for Jolie in her earlier, ""Girl, Interrupted"" days might be excused for giving up hope she'll become our next great movie star.

There are some flashbacks that tell flesh out the character, but a little bit more would've been nice in addition to more exposition surrounding her character. Also, I felt the film should've been longer. The notion of a female spy is an exciting and intriguing idea;having seen so many spy movies with mostly male heroes, this one mixes things up differently.

Cut to the story. An interrogation of a Russian defector reveals that the CIA interrogator – Evelyn – is possibly a double agent (why he gives this information voluntarily to the CIA at large is but one of the faux pas of the movie). In any case, Evelyn performs her dubious role admirably in battling the forces of law and order while fulfilling her near-impossible assassination missions through various decent to good action sequences, and suffice to say that many realities are stretched. When you have finished yawning through the Defcon II and suicide bomber and Universal Soldier-like sequences, the movie trails off rather ambitiously in the quest for a sequel.

"JaynaB","9","5","11","12 August 2010"," A much better movie than I was led to expect
","Great show, although grim, and I'll probably see it again.<br/><br/>I mainly went to see how Angelina Jolie handled her first action role post-twins, and promptly forgot I was watching the sexiest woman alive because of her complete immersion in the character, who was very often not sexy. This movie was more complex and psychologically consistent than I was led to expect by trailers and early reviews. The whole plot was NOT, as I had feared, revealed in the trailer.<br/><br/>This is not a film that capitalizes on the actor's undoubted sex appeal; instead it reminds us why this actor won an Oscar. There's one scene in which the whole remaining plot cohesion hangs on the expression changing through her eyes while her face remains perfectly still. And she pulls it off. Although, judging from the number of (mostly male) media reviewers who say the plot doesn't hang together, a lot of people were focusing on the actor's lush lips at that point instead of watching the character respond (or not) to a significant event. Me, I was watching her eyes, and had a pretty good handle on what was going on inside the character during subsequent events."

"Uriah43","6","2","3","26 February 2015"," An Action Film from Start to Finish
","This movie begins with a young woman named ""Evelyn Salt"" (Angelina Jolie) being held in a North Korean prison and protesting her innocence while she is being brutally interrogated for being an American spy. Not long afterward she is released in a prisoner swap. The movie then fast-forwards 2 years later and shows Evelyn happily married to the German national who helped gain her release named ""Mike Krause"" (August Diehl). We then learn that Evelyn was indeed a CIA agent and is currently working in Langley, Virginia. Unfortunately, things take a definite turn for the worse right after that. Now rather than reveal any more of this movie and risk spoiling it for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this was an action film from start to finish. It had a good plot and I liked the acting of Angelina Jolie. On the other hand, I must also admit that there were several scenes that were simply too far-fetched which ended up totally straining credibility. Likewise the ending was much too abrupt as well. That said I rate the movie as just slightly above average."
"RJBurke1942","6","2","3","25 January 2014"," Where Salt gives a new perspective on bitter-sweet victory
","In the manner of other action spy dramas (see the Bourne franchise, for example, or the interminable Bond series etc), this outing is simply another vehicle for another (unlikely) action heroine, Evelyn Salt (Jolie), who demonstrates her ability to foil all attempts to keep her locked down, in chains, tied up, handcuffed or imprisoned â€“ so that she can ""save the world"", as one of the key characters remarks towards the end of this frenetically paced, kick-butt, auto mangling, wall breaking, truck smashing and totally improbable plot. Still, it's exciting with some truly imaginative stunts to help take your breath away.<br/><br/>Accompanying Jolie, we see her concerned boss, Ted Winter (Schreiber), Peabody (Ejiofor) â€“ all CIA agents â€“ Salt's husband, Krause (Diel), and Orlov (Olbrychiski), a Russian spy who sets the ball rolling when he surrenders to the CIA. Naturally, in this sort of caper, nothing is ever as it seems. So, keep the sound up when they're talking to keep up with the clues and plot twists. The most I'll say is that it's different; but it has similar convoluted excesses as, say, The Manchurian Candidate (1962, 2004) and the B and B series.<br/><br/>Jolie is credibly tough, Schreiber is suitably urbane, Ejiofor cannily persistent, Diel naively supportive and the Russians are, wellÂ…stereotypically Russian. In other words, the acting fits the scenes (no pun intended). As you might expect, the editing is superb throughout. The direction by Noyce is precise and allows the story to unfold without too much thinking; just go with it.<br/><br/>But why Salt â€“ why that name? Well, during the Cold War, the USA and USSR actually held a series of Strategic Arms Limitation Talks â€“ aka SALT I. Those talks morphed, later, into SALT II.<br/><br/>I guess Evelyn Salt decided there'd been enough talking already: time for action. So, we might see Salt II down the road where she finishes the job.<br/><br/>Give this six out of ten, mainly for action, photography and editing. Recommended for action fans only.<br/><br/>January 25, 2014"

","This question at the heart of this movie is ""whose side is Salt on?"" The Americans', the Russians', or just her own? Every 15 or 20 minutes there's a new twist, so you're never quite sure what to make of her, even at the very end of the film.<br/><br/>This movie also delivers well on the 'Hollywood thrill' of seeing a lone renegade agent out-thinking and out-fighting the entire US government (although it has to be said that's been done before, and done better, in the Bourne films).<br/><br/>They could have improved the movie further by making Salt into a more complex character. She was very cold and calculating and always looked in control. She never seemed to face a moral dilemma or a situation she couldn't easily handle. Even the climactic double-crossing of Liev Schreiber's character didn't seem to phase her.<br/><br/>Overall, though, I enjoyed this movie and I hope they get round to making a sequel."

Just sit back and enjoy the ridiculous ride and give your cynical brain a rest.

","***SPOILERS*** Very exciting but factually ridiculous film about this plot to destroy the USA by a group of Soviets sleeper agents on what they've designated to be called X Day: The Day of Judgement! The trouble with all that is that their totally unaware that the Soviet Government that engineered this half baked plan back in he 1970's at the height of the Cold War has been out of circulation or business for almost 20 years.<br/><br/>The top honcho or assassin in this entire scheme turns out to be sleeper CIA agent Evelyn Salt, Angelina Jolie, who's in fact outed by Russian defector Vasily Oriov, Daniel Olbrychski, who claims he dying of cancer and has nothing to lose. As it turned out Salt is to be part of an assassin plan to knock off the Russian President Boris Matveyev, Olek Krupa, who's to attend Vice President Otis' funeral in New York City. It's then that the action really starts popping with Salt having her clover blown now on the run throughout the entire movie for reasons,besides being outed, known only to herself. It seems that Salt has somehow changed her opinion for those she's working for and become a good guy or good gal and joined forces with the good old,where she spent almost her entire life, USA.<br/><br/>It takes a while to realize what's going on in the film with Salt preforming all kinds of superhuman feats like jumping 200 feet with a wet t-shirt from a helicopter, after being shot, into the freezing Potomac River that would make spies and martial art artists like James Bond and Bruce Lee look like stark armatures in comparison. Salt is first involved in the assassination of President Matveyev and then for no reason whats so ever turns on her Soviet sleeper comrades, whom she put to sleep permanently, ending up knocking off the entire crew. Including Vasily Oriov who in fact turned out to be her father! There's also the very pressing problem facing Salt in that theirs a mole in the CIA who's using her to do all his dirty work! He's then planning to ice Salt and become a hero in saving the USA and the world, that this sleeper unit he's part of was planning, from nuclear destruction.<br/><br/>Algelina Jolie is very convincing as the indestructible Evelyn Salt who's out to save the world with the world,or US Government,out to stop her in thinking that she's in fact really trying to destroy it. Salt's boss in the CIA Ted Winter, Liev Schreiber, doesn't quite know what to make of her in feeling that Salt is somehow a double agent and playing a deadly game of cat and mouse with both countries that she's working for. The same goes for head of White House security Mr. Peabody, Chiwetel Ejlofor, who despite all the damage Salt caused him, killing dozens of his men, feels that she's really on the right side, the USA, of the issues. <br/><br/>***SPOILERS*** There's also Salt's husband Michael Krause, August Diehl, who's expertise in spider venom comes in very handy for Salt later on in the film in being able to bring back the dead in the case of Russian President Boris Matveyev. An event that not only blows the entire plan of setting off a Third World War, by Oriov & Co, but ended up costing Michael his life."

","Angelina Jolie is a spy on the run. Accused of being a Russian spy, she tries to sort things out for herself. The film does well in keeping her motives and character shadowy enough so we always suspect her. Schreiber and Ejiofor, two of the most perfect supporting actors, really make this look easy. Nailing the trusting and untrusting agents. The action is fast and heavy, with Noyce behind the camera, this all feels real and gritty. The violence was actually too much for an espionage thriller. It really pushed the envelope, but in ways that really disconnected me from Salt. Bond, Bourne, Bauer, etc. All managed to keep a certain amount of charm, humanity, or innocence in their performance. A bit surprising to find the female equivalent as a pretty heartless bitch.My main issue was the outdatedness of the whole cold war paranoia. Sure, the spy genre took a major hit when the Soviet Union collapsed, but I found it a bit too much to really feel any threat. Action good, characters OK, plot and originality very poor."

","A CIA agent goes on the run after a defector accuses her of being a Russian spy.<br/><br/>I really enjoy spy-action flicks like these. And Salt does have it's part in these enjoyable movies. Salt is a very cat-and-mouse chase type movie where everyone is accusing the woman of being a Russian spy and throughout, you see her escaping from them. The action scenes are pretty well-done from fast moving chase to run-and-gun shoot downs. Salt is the last name of the woman in the movie for those wondering why such a weird title. Salt also has a pretty stupid twist in my opinion, and in some ways, doesn't even make sense. But for what this movie is, I'm guessing I could say it worked. So not much else to really say about this, Salt is a highly-entertaining experience and a very well done action movie. Although the film isn't groundbreaking and considered to be the best of the year, the film is still worthy of seeing. 7/10."

"jimbo-53-186511","7","1","1","31 March 2018"," Like a lot of action films it's filled with a lot of ridiculous set-pieces but to its credit it is fast-paced and entertaining
","A Russian defector enters the CIA Headquarters and proceeds to tell CIA agent Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie) that he has intelligence suggesting that the Russian president is going to be assassinated on US soil. Curious to know more she interrogates the man, but when he divulges that the person who will carry out the assassination is none other than Evelyn Salt herself Evelyn panics and insists that the man is lying. However, the defector passes the CIA's lie detector test and the CIA become suspicious of Evelyn. Realising that her colleagues don't believe her she goes on the run whilst at the same time trying to track her husband down whom she also believes may be in danger...<br/><br/>Working from a script by Kurt Wimmer director Phillip Noyce clearly knew that he was forced to work around a fairly generic narrative with Salt; yes you could argue that there are red herrings in the story and the odd twist and turn here and there but the main components of the story aren't terribly original.<br/><br/>Perhaps that's why Noyce chose to not get too bogged down with unnecessary exposition and needless sub-plots and focused on injecting the film with a fast-pace and plenty of action sequences (which is what I suspect that most audiences look for in an action film). Salt is a chase picture of sorts and thankfully that's exactly what it feels like and this is the main component that drives the film forward at a lightning pace. It's fair to say that Noyce gets a bit carried away with the action and seems to throw realism out of the door a lot of the time - Angie's antics (particularly on the freeway with the trucks are so far removed from reality that it almost makes her seem superhuman). The action clichÃ©s extend further in that the bad guys always miss and Angie always hits which would normally be a problem for me, but the film moves along so quickly that I was never really given the opportunity to allow for this to become a problem (I only thought about it afterwards tbh). <br/><br/>As well as being fast-paced, slick and entertaining the film also benefits from a very good turn from Angelina Joile - she's a diverse actress whom I feel doesn't always get the recognition that she deserves - I've always felt that she's more than just a pretty face.<br/><br/>For action-junkies this is a must see (despite Noyce over-staging the action sequences on numerous occasions). The story is reasonably good, it moves at a lightning pace and you get to see Angelina Jolie kick a load of butt and show off her lovely pins now and again. What more could you ask for?"

"dfranzen70","8","7","18","23 July 2010"," Stunning Jolie slums it well in tight thriller
","Salt, a spy movie about a CIA agent who may or may not actually be a Soviet agent, is a heck of a lot better than others in its genre. It has a lot of pulse-quickening action, astounding stunt work, and a semiplausible plot. Oh, and someone named Angelina Jolie to do all the requisite butt-kicking.<br/><br/>There have been plenty of psychological thrillers in which the protagonist is double crossed, then triple crossed, and so on until the audience quite literally has no idea who's on what side or who's doing what to whom - it's sort of an entertainment by obfuscation. Sleight of hand. It's when the director tries hard to confuse the bejeezus out of everyone, the better to disguise a thin plot and cardboard acting.<br/><br/>But that isn't true here. Jolie plays Evelyn Salt, a CIA analyst who's accused - from the get-go - of being a sleeper spy, by a Russian attempting to defect. Naturally, our gal Evelyn bolts the CIA and goes on the run. But unlike other movies, where the balance of the plot would be devoted to her finding the Real Bad Guys and Righting Wrongs and Clearing Her Name, this film keeps us guessing: Is Salt really a preprogrammed spy with the goal of assassinating the visiting Russian president? Her CIA boss (Liev Shrieber) and the head of counterintelligence (Chiwetel Ejiofor) dash off to New York to catch her, and she eludes them at every step. And all the while, we're not sure if she's a good guy or a bad guy, or a good guy with bad intentions, or perhaps a good guy with a shady past.<br/><br/>And although the ending isn't neat and tidy, it's also not implausible, another hallmark of run-of-the-mill spy thrillers. It's refreshing.<br/><br/>Angelina Jolie has shown time and time again that she supersedes all of those preconceived ideas of pretty actresses. She's beautiful, yes, but she's also a very gifted actress. It's in full evidence here, as her Salt dons numerous disguises that really do a good job of hiding her amazing looks. Lesser actresses would wilt under the pressure of, you know, actually performing as opposed to being gawked at, but Jolie flourishes. And she has some serious action-movie chops, too! Apparently, she did her own stunts, and she's simply electrifying. It's easy to believe that her role was originally written for a male lead - what in Hollywood isn't? - but it's hard to imagine many top-shelf actors doing as much with the role as Jolie does here. As with the best actors, Jolie can do a lot with the slightest bit of movement or expression. She is mesmerizing and tremendous.<br/><br/>She's ably supported by Shrieber and Ejiofor, and although neither character is particularly fleshed out, neither, too, is obvious and shallow. So, good script from Kurt Wimmer.<br/><br/>Oh, sure, there's a spot midway through the movie where you begin to consider the possibilities of what Salt's up to, where the script's headed, and you figure out what the big twist at the end is going to be. Or maybe I just got lucky. Probably the biggest obstacle that writers of psychological thrillers face is the plot corner, where they've made things so intricate that they can't write themselves out of their own traps. Here, there are only a few possible outcomes, so it's not too tough to figure out what will eventually happen - the trick is that Noyce and Wimmer make getting to that eventuality a rough, perilous journey.<br/><br/>All in all, Salt is the kind of movie that, say, Eagle Eye or Repo Men or State of Play or even Knight and Day wish they were. It's expertly directed by Noyce, who also has given us Patriot Games and the overlooked Rabbit Proof Fence and features a powerful performance by Angelina Jolie. Oh, and in case there was any doubt, it's sequel-ready."

","If you like the Bourne Identity and you want to see it played out by a woman, then this movie is perfect for you. There are plenty of scenes where the protagonist is chased by a crowd of secret agents and somehow miraculously getting away (but of course). Even the music during the chase scenes reminds me of Bourne. For that reason the movie sometimes feels like a sequel, despite it being an original. <br/><br/>The plot is a bit over-the-top at times, and some of the twists and turns seem artificial. The lead character fits Angelina Jolie well. The problem is that you're never sure if she is worth it for you the audience to side with her, and that makes it hard for you to be really involved in her fate. All in all the movie is entertaining as far as summer movies go."

","I liked this movie a lot. I hate to be typical, but it's nice to see a female character that is intense and raw like Salt, rather than the typical sexy, weaker female sidekick (though Angie is very sexy). Angelina Jolie is a savage. I'm surprised she didn't bite off anyone's throat (I apologize if that is considered a spoiler). Seriously though, I have never seen a woman kick that much ass in my life. She was pretty amazing. So if you are expecting the successful CIA one man show like Bourne Identity, you won't find that here. But if you are expecting comparable action with a weaker story, then watch Salt. In any case, who really watches these movies for the story anyways? I expected Salt to be a great action movie and I got it. <br/><br/>This movie is really all action. My friend's main complaint was that it had too much action.

","The interrogation of a Russian defector at the beginning of Salt (in the trailer as well) sets the rocking premise that Angelina Jolie's character, Evelyn Salt, could be a double agent working for the CIA but an operative of the old Soviet Union trying to re-emerge in the post-cold war world. Sleeper spy syndrome is at work here.<br/><br/>The stars are running this summerâ€”DiCaprio from the law as he plies his corporate espionage craft in Inception, Tom Cruise from his own spy agency as they brand him a rogue, and Jolie as we can see from the above. Must be something in the summer air or in their careers as they move up in age, Jolie 35, DiCaprio 36, and Cruise a healthy but aging 48. <br/><br/>And the winner: Jolie for pure fantasy heroics, Lara Croft on steroids with an audience willing to accept the most outlandish setups and screw-ups in the name of summer escapism. She and her doubles jump from truck to truck on the freeway to far outdo Cruise in his contrasting minimalist athletic excesses with moving vehicles. <br/><br/>What Salt is able to do in two hours of non-stop shenanigans is criminal if you have an overactive left brain; if your right brain kicks in, you'll enjoy her unbelievable dispatching of every trained agent trying to stop her from assassinating the presidents of Russia and the USA. Dare I suggest to you, very bright reader, that no way in heck will Jolie be cast as a Russian spy threatening the lives of the most powerful leaders in the world. Enough said.<br/><br/>Yes, although it's all beyond absurd, I was delighted to see another female hero kick the hell out of men (Lisbeth, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, does a commendable job on misogynists). In fact, let me declare once again Ms. Jolie the leader of the pack in cool attitude and astonishingly good looks, and at an old 35."

In the real world, it is difficult for a man to defeat two very well trained men at once, let alone several. Yet when Bourne or Bond do it, movie goers consider it ""realism.""

Angelina Jolie did a great job as Evelyn Salt and the plot left enough twists and turns to keep one on the edge of their seats.

After trying to interrogate a captured Russian person, she is then accused of being a Russian sleeper agent lurking in the U.S. With no other choice, Salt goes on the run to clear her name and so the question remains: ""Who is Salt?"" From the trailer, I thought it was so thrilling. I know, many trailers these days are thrilling even though the original film is horrible. But, it also looks interesting and I think ""Salt"" is an amazing action film that will blow your minds up.<br/><br/>Although you might have some thoughts about the question or the tag line it self, the movie has many surprises than what you expect from the trailer. Maybe you expect this to be good but in the movie, he's bad. Some things like that. I'll tell you a tip, the main antagonist I may say is almost nothing what you expect from the trailer.<br/><br/>The acting was perfect. Angelina Jolie acted Evelyn Salt like she was really Salt. It was mesmerizing. I loved her acting. No problem with the acting. Liev Schreiber as Ted Winter is a good friend of Salt. Schreiber who was Sabretooth last year was great now. He looked really confident and was really in depth in his acting. The other minors are also memorable. The acting was in a word ... amazing.<br/><br/>The cinematography was brilliant. The action scenes were perfectly directed at any aspect of mine. The director, Phillip Noyce tried to make every scene enjoyable and the climax of the movie at maximum level. Of course, he needed the help of the music from James Newton Howard to increase the excitement of the film. The others like the special effects were simply perfect.<br/><br/>If you know the plot from what you get from the Internet, that is barely telling you any part of the story. That is just the beginning of the story, not even a single secret out. So, I guarantee that when you watch this brilliant thriller on the big screen, you'll get surprised.<br/><br/>To wrap this up, ""Salt"" is absolutely a rare thriller you might find these days besides ""Inception"" which was also a masterpiece. I recommend this to action lovers, people who love surprises as this movie provides many plot twists and of course, fans of Angelina Jolie when she's in action. I give this movie a rating of 9 out of 10 and of course, thanks for reading my review. Hope you find my review useful."

Considering it's the No. 2 spot in the Box Office charts right now, that seems to be a big possibility. So on that note, director Philip Noyce very much delivers the goods and if it indeed comes, he should make the follow-up very soon!"

","Greetings again from the darkness. Remember the Alamo! Remember the Cold War! OK, the Alamo has nothing to do with this, but if you can remember Russia as a superpower and the bad guy whom the U.S. spent years and billions trying to out-spy and out-defend, then this story might makes some sense to you. Of course, the story matters little here. What matters is the action and it is actually pretty intense and well done.<br/><br/>Angelina Jolie has always reminded me of the scene in ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" when Strother Martin is testing out Sundance's shooting skills. When Sundance misses the first target, he asks ""Can I move?"". He then proves he is much better when he moves. Angelina is the same. In her films that let her ""move"", she is amazing. Think ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" vs. ""Changeling"". The first she seems a natural. The second she came across as miscast. In this film, she does things no human being could do, but does these things with such commitment, that we actually believe she is capable. Her actions often border on parkour ... especially when in an elevator shaft or a freeway, and we accept these stunts because it's Angelina.<br/><br/>Support work is provided by Liev Schreiber and Chiwetel Ejiofor, both who spend much of the movie trying to figure out how Angelina does the things she does ... surrounded by their teams of weapons experts. Most of the time, the way she is outnumbered leaves you thinking that if she gets out of this jam, this movie is just stupid. But once she has escaped, you just feel a little more pumped up! That's a sign of a good action movie.<br/><br/>Sure, the story is ridiculous at most points and the plot holes are more canyons than holes, but it's kind of nice to re-visit the double or triple spy days, especially when it's placed within daring stunts and chases that work.<br/><br/>The director of this is Phillip Noyce, who is best known for a couple of the Tom Clancy adaptations - ""Patriot Games"" and ""Clear and Present Danger"". Mr. Noyce got me hooked 20 years ago on a little film called ""Dead Calm"", starring a very young Nicole Kidman. That is a taut little thriller that takes place mostly on a sail boat in the middle of the ocean. If you've never seen it, you should.<br/><br/>So in regards to ""Salt"", I will say that it's a fun action-thriller in a twisty little cold war spy setting. Don't get caught up in the plot details and just enjoy the action sequences by Angelina Jolie. Not very often I recommend ignoring a faulty script, but I actually enjoyed this one."
"aharmas","10","7","19","23 July 2010"," The most fun I had since ""Raiders of The Lost Ark""
","Spy, mystery, and action films are exciting and very good when done right and with the perfect star. Harrison Ford infused the ""Indiana Jones"" films with his sense of humour and adventure, and he was certainly a great asset to ""The Fugitive"" and the ""Star Wars"" series. The formula works well in ""Salt"" when Angelina Jolie delivers a magnetic and exciting performance which becomes the furious center of this marvelous thriller.<br/><br/>There is not a lime wasted in long explanations and flashbacks to make the story too complex and seem more sophisticated than what it is. Instead it's a non-stop series of chases when layer after layer is peeled, and we are still glued to the screen wondering how this all will end. Thankfully, we still care that the leading lady is someone we care about, even when we don't know what role she might be playing.<br/><br/>The film is the perfect length, clocking at under 100 minutes and giving us plenty of superb action, incredible stunt work, and somehow in the middle of this lightweight entertainment, this is a very entertaining film that never lags for one second, some good acting, particularly, Jolie who can transmit more with a couple of glances than a long, convoluted speech can muster. This is not a film that wastes its precious minutes in silly dialogue. It gives us what we expect to see in a movie of this kind, a relentless, nonstop, exciting, and sometimes fantastic adventure where we care about what happens to the protagonist who might be the ultimate heroine or the most incredible villain.<br/><br/>In the middle of a series of intrigues which eventually reveal Salt's true nature, and through which she must prove her innocence or be proved guilty, she confronts obstacle after obstacle on her way to one of the most exciting and satisfying conclusion in recent cinema. Indeed, this is a film you don't want to stop even when you might need that bathroom break. No hoopla here, just plenty of top notch work by Jolie, Schreiber, and Phillip Noyce and his very capable team of editors and other professionals.<br/><br/>This is one time when I was looking forward to seeing a ""To Be Continued"" at the end of the story, and I wouldn't have been one bit disappointed. I am looking forward to seeing more and more of this type of work."

"Likes_Ninjas90","8","4","9","8 September 2010"," Salt is superior entertainment
","Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie) is a CIA agent who is happily married to Mike (August Diehl), an arachnologist. They married after he arranged for her rescue when she was captured and tortured by the North Koreans. At the CIA headquarters Salt is asked by her colleagues Ted (Liev Schreiber) and Peabody (Chiwetel Ejiofor) to perform a quick interview with a Russian named Orlov (Daniel Olbrychski) who may have valuable information regarding an assassination plot. Orlov reveals that there is a plan to kill the Russian President, who is attending the funeral of the US Vice President and that there are numerous Russian spies at large in America. He identifies the name of one of the spies as Evelyn Salt. Ted and Peabody are distracted by two separate threads: the escape of Orlov after he kills two agents and then Salt herself, who quickly goes on the run because she cannot risk being detained in case Mike is in danger. It is unclear as to whether Salt as a fugitive is out to save or kill the Russian President herself. <br/><br/>On the surface this may seem like superfluous entertainment but Australian film director Phillip Noyce has turned Salt into a thrill ride of the highest order. He has made several exceptions to the standard action genre, most notably his efforts to ground the film in a high degree of realism. The stunts, like Salt leaping from one moving semi-trailer to another, may seem absurd but Noyce films them in such a way that he makes us feel the impact of every one of Salt's battles. Her tumbles and her fistfights look and feel real, partly because Jolie does all of her own stunt work. The bruises she receives, like the nerve damage to her eye at the beginning, appear with authenticity. It is thankful how sparingly Noyce uses a hand-held camera during the action too. He has stated that his film moves selectively from a tripod to a hand-held camera later on to smartly represent the change from stability to anarchy. Thus, even without high quantities of blood, Salt is intense and exciting because of the efficiency of Noyce's sturdy direction. While the action is spectacular and fun, Salt is also driven by a narrative that is surprisingly involving. There are a lot of fight scenes and biff but what makes this more engaging than usual is that we can never be entirely sure of Salt's allegiance to either the Russians or the USA. Many scenes cleverly work to manipulate the audience into thinking that she is working for one side and then subvert our expectations. The action not only provides the spectacle but works to develop the theme of espionage as well. Furthermore, as ludicrous as the plot is here, recent events like the exposure of undercover Russians secretly living in the USA makes the timing of Salt oddly appropriate.<br/><br/>Angelina Jolie is one of the few Hollywood actresses that could make the stunt work of Salt as credible as possible. The film was originally going to feature a male CIA agent and was first offered to Tom Cruise, who turned the part down. Thankfully, Jolie is perfectly cast as Salt, a woman who is tough, beautiful and most importantly, human. There are inspired touches given to her character. I loved how Salt decides to take her high-heeled shoes off the first time she escapes. It's a minor detail but one that most movie characters would forget and it adds to Salt's believability. There's another cool moment where Salt dyes her hair jet-black, just as her allegiance starts to become murky for the audience. Yet it's the brief flashbacks that are interspersed between the action scenes that give a greater sense to the happiness and the humanity shared between Salt and her husband. There is some heart to be found in Salt, both the character and the film. Liev Schreiber and Chiwetel Ejiofor have fairly stock roles here but at least the dialogue is minimal enough so that they do not embarrass themselves with overtly bureaucratic speeches, common in spy films like this. <br/><br/>Salt is a highly impacting and exciting action thriller because of the intensity of the direction by Phillip Noyce. He grounds the action with as much realism as possible, allowing the audience to become far more involved with the film's possible-heroine and her death defying stunts. The action is also regularly supported by a clever story that continually makes us question the true motives of Salt. Jolie's physically dominant performance here is impacting enough that the audience lives on almost every single punch and fall that she's involved in. Salt is superior entertainment."

","It's one of those films where I went in not really knowing much of the plot (even though I'd read quite a lot about it) and what little expectations I had were proved, pretty quickly, to be wrong. It amazed me in every respect, visually it was a mixture of creative camera angles and shots. The plot was, in my eyes, pretty unpredictable and took many unexpected twists, the acting left nothing to be wished for and Jolie, once again, proved her versatility and talent as an actress. Now that I've seen it once I would really like to see it again now that I understand it better and knowing what I now know. There could be the possibility of a sequel as the end is left open. Great film with little blood and gore for the violence, the language is strong in places but overall not too bad. but basically, I LOVED IT, GO AND SEE IT!"
"ajfdomingo","8","4","9","22 August 2010"," Typical Summer Fare
","Salt is a fast paced spy thriller that keeps the viewer riveted to the edge of his or her seat. Angelina Jolie is well cast as the double agent Evelyn Salt. It is a challenge to think of any other actress who could do a better job than Jolie of projecting an air of mystery while taking on a physically demanding role. Like other films in the espionage thriller genre, Salt leaves it up to the audience to sort out the good guys from the bad ones. The plot is not too complicated that it will befuddle the audience but it has enough twists to keep them interested from start to finish. Salt has a noticeably short run time, just over an hour and a half which is comparable to a typical animated feature. Perhaps, the speed by which the story unfolds does not allow for more subplots which may not suit viewers who want more substance in their films. But as with other summer fare, this film is very much within the ballpark. It is highly entertaining with a big name star for a lead and is marketed to as wide an audience as possible. I would say that the audience does get its money's worth by seeing this film."

","While the film had great action scenes, and an interesting premise (Angelina Jolie as badass CIA agent) -- the problem is that the entire plot and story was written for a John McCain and Sarah Palin America, one where the continued escalation of tension between the US and Russia takes place.<br/><br/>But since the NATO missile shield project has been scaled back, and since Obama and Medvedev & Putin have warmed up, and since the realization that the US and Russia are fighting on two fronts of the same war..... and oh yeah, the US and Russia just nonchalantly exchanged 12 Russian sleeper spies for a few US spies.... the entire premise of the movie's antagonists makes no sense.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the Cold War is over.

"montera_iulian","5","4","9","11 August 2010"," They thought Bourne with a vagina would make a difference (minor spoiler alert)
","The truth is that there is a difference: clearly a big one. The Jason Bourne movies are just incomparable. Salt looked like some unfinished film. The basic story it's over-used and the only thing they added was another soap-opera twist after the relevant one. The clicheic storyline, the straight-forward dialogue, the obvious twists and the stereotypical development of the characters contributed all to the expected ""disappointing"" movie directed by Phillip Noyce. What's wrong with the story is that it takes all the basic ideas from great spy-movies like Jason Bourne especially and adds some basic new-age nonsense. The main character is Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie), some ex-Russian spy who along the road of her ""career"" decided to change parties and began to work in favor for (of course, as always) United States without them knowing about her past. The stereotypes are so vivid that it's almost impossible not to see them. The russians, again, are made to look like cruel and revengeful terrorists while the Americans are all for peace and fight for our freedom. This is the 21st century's biggest bullsh*t. Skipping away this political non-sense and getting back to the movie, one day some Russian ""ex-spy"" decides to reveal Salt's true identity to the C.I.A. From this point on the madness begins and each minute passes by things get worse. The action sequences are ridiculous for a ""skinny"" woman like Angelina Jolie is (and I'm sorry to say it but her days from Gia and Original Sin are long gone). I mean who could believe she would survive from all the falls and tortures and fights she goes through? It's just hilarious. The movie should have ended somewhere in like the first 20 minutes but no, Salt was somewhere close to Superman. It was painful to watch at times because everything was so unrealistic (remember the elevator scene? laughing my ass off).<br/><br/>Besides the plot holes and bad dialogue, besides the stupid action sequences and terrible choreography the acting didn't helped the movie at all. Angelina Jolie was far from her older days, all we see is her sharing punches, shooting guns randomly, fight 3 C.I.A. agents at one time and shed some tears to make the audience probably feel some compassion towards the main character but what Noyce didn't imagined were the laughs in the theaters. Liev Schreiber, the guy from X-Men Origins: Wolverine and Repo Men played again the expected villain. I mean, was it that hard to not realize that by the middle of the movie? Other than the storyline and the average acting, the execution was also poorly done. What was with that chaotic camera-work in each chase sequence? Some shots were terrible and the editing was so by the book: no improvisation and no guts. The soundtrack was also off the tone of the movie. It has some key-notes from the Terminator's classic soundtrack which to me was laughable. Only two scenes were nice accompanied by music but everything else was cheap imitation.<br/><br/>The ending of the movie leaves room for a sequel but I PRAY that they would decide to not make any since it didn't succeed at the box-office. And what about a couple of scenes that were in the trailer but were cut from the actual movie? Where was Angelina's leg in that dress? That's what I want to know? I paid money to see that also so... I left not 2x but 3x disappointed.<br/><br/>Salt promotes itself as a serious spy-action movie close to Jason Bourne as far as the context but it forgets to deliver exactly the necessary. It's a good film to ""waste-some-time"" for the end of a horrific working week but other than that it's definitely nothing worthy of paying money for. You could easily skip it even if you're an Angelina Jolie fan."

","There is a certain note to this movie - disbelief. First Angelina Jolie is way to thin, despite the fake long hair and big clothes they used to hide it, to be an special agent, train to whitstand pain and fight mans at lest 20 kg heavier than her. I don't now if this a Hollywood obsession aka be as thin possible, but she is skin and bone. Second the sleper agents theme is so old, nobody believe it anymore. It's a good way to scary the population to accept new taxes and new funds to those in need, but nothing more. Third, why bother educate infant spies, when bribing the officials is a much easier way to obtain anything? Fanatic spies are a liability, because, like any other fanatic, they see the world in white and black. Once you establish a pattern of thought, they will reject any other ideas, destroying everything else in their path? Forth, the president of the USA was made to look like a nobody from the streets. In real life he is ,at least, an expert haggler, because he had to 'buy' his way up through party politics, business tycoons, different groups with different agenda, etc. While speaking about the president, i really doubt he's security is so scant. In the end this movie is a mish mash of bad ideas and second rated spy stories, with slow action and convoluted story."

","From the director of PATRIOT GAMES comes this actioner with political intrigue starring Angelina Jolie as CIA agent Evelyn Salt, who may just be a Russian mole well trained to instigate the downfall of the United States through the murder of the Russian President. On the run, and seeking to find her husband, a spider specialist(whose ties to North Korea come in handy in both rescuing Salt, but helping her invade the enemy's country for intelligence), Mike Krause(August Diehl), we see that Salt might just be the mole agent Peabody(Chiwetel Ejiofor)fears she is when Evelyn orchestrates the supposed murder of Russian President Mayveyev(Olek Krupa)attending the funeral of America's Vice President. Salt is a Princeton graduate with training in all forms of intelligence and combat. Is Salt a Russian spy? If so, has she seen the error of her ways? The finale could have Salt involved in the assassination of the US President!<br/><br/>Set aside the unbelievable plot, you really can not take it with a grain of salt(pun intended)as Salt leaps from bridges to the top of a moving truck, then from another moving truck to yet a third! In this jaw dropping action sequence has CIA and police attempting to chase her down(of course, failing to do so)in order to see if she is in fact the mole. Liev Schreiber is CIA agent Ted Winter, Salt's boss, who has a hard time accepting that Salt could be a mole. You have the incredible escape to New York City as mentioned above(see how Salt hops on a motorcycle to evade her pursuers inside a lot of traffic, not to mention how she escapes from her apartment on the outside of the building walking across small ledges)topped by the amazing razzle dazzle after being captured, handcuffed, placed inside a cop truck to be escorted to prison, again able to get away thanks to a taser(you just have to see how she uses this weapon to force a subdued cop driver into pressing the accelerator to move the vehicle, finishing with a death defying plunge from a bridge into parked cars below), soon meeting up with her old teacher, Vassily Orlov(Daniel Olbrychski), who was actually responsible for blowing her cover(this odd occurrence which sets everything in motion is later explained in more detail). Why would Orlov expose his pupil to her superiors? I will not give away a twist identifying a second mole, but it does give meaning to Orlov's opening scene in the CIA interrogation room. There's also the conclusion taking place in the White House as we truly see where Salt's loyalties reside. The fate of the Russian President and the attempt to kill the US President both play a hand into the horrifying possibility of nuclear war, which builds the suspense at the end as we see Salt move past numerous Secret agents heading towards the ""war room"". I can see why many compared SALT to a Bourne movie, just as directed by someone like Philip Noyce whose past films(such as PATRIOT GAMES & CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER)revolved around DC and the political spectrum. Jolie is equipped with phenomenal fighting abilities, she can take down anyone in her path. Her identity is mysterious, we are held in the dark in regards to her motivations, but we certainly see the damage Salt is capable of. Everything hinges on Salt's feelings for her husband, and his fate is what will push her towards her ultimate destination."
"jfgibson73","4","4","9","24 July 2010"," Just another ""save the world"" action movie'
","Salt is an action movie that starts out mysteriously, then turns into a conventional ""save-the-world"" action hero story. Angelina Jolie plays a female James Bond type--sorry folks, but that's basically all it is--who is involved with some sort of plan involving Russian spies and assassination plots. The first act is a lengthy chase, in which we get to see how resourceful and well trained our main character is. The second act, however, sells her as completely unstoppable as she takes on the entire Secret Service. I suppose we shouldn't even be surprised that the last part of the movie has her infiltrating the White House (she is even able to hot-wire security doors in the President's secret bunker). By this time, what started out as partially mysterious has become a completely conventional action movie, with our hero turning off nuclear missiles at the last moment before they are launched. There are going to be a lot of viewers who are more upset at the ending, which doesn't really unfold like we'd expect, than all the routine, predictable stuff that happens just before. The problem with the last couple minutes of the movie isn't that we don't get the resolution we expect, but that it is edited so choppily. If they had shown the same action happen with a some lingering shots instead of jittery jump-cuts, it could have worked.<br/><br/>The other thing I want to say about this movie is that I read a review by Roger Ebert that made this movie sound really fun. He explained that most of the action is completely improbable, which is true, but he also called it ""trash,"" which led me to believe it might be a little campy and over the top. But no, this movie takes itself very seriously. I don't recommend it."

","The Soviet Union, dead lo these many years, is revivified and set to its evil work again in this political chase story. I'd like to call it a ""thriller"" but it's not. It's a ""chase story."" You see, Angelina Jolie is Evelyn Salt, a high-level CIA type in Washington, working under her company friend, Liev Schreiber. Jolie is their Russian expert and the movie opens with her interrogating a Russian defector. The defector tells the skeptical Jolie that the USSR planted a dozen moles in the US back in the 1980s. The mission of the moles: to assassinate the visiting president of modern Russia while he attends the funeral of his good friend, the Vice President of the United States, in New York. Russia will take this as an American plot and start vamping up its missiles. America will have to retaliate. Chaos will follow.<br/><br/>How -- you, the discerning viewer, ask -- how did anybody in the decaying USSR of the 1980s know what the international situation would look like in 2010? And what -- you ask -- do these Soviet moles hope to gain from a nuclear war? Those are good questions and it does you credit that you've asked them. No, really.<br/><br/>But that's nothing compared to the questions raised by the rest of the movie. First, let me limn in the general style of this commercial Schlagfest. During the opening scene, when the defector is describing the moles, he ends by saying that one of the dozen specially trained agents is named Evelyn Salt. Well, gosh, that's JOLIE. The CIA observers on the other side of the glass wall gasp. It's impossible. But then Jolie, with the flimsiest of excuses, departs the premises in a crash of glass and a leap from one window sill to another, one hundred and forty floors above the tiny street below. The CIA goes ape chasing her, and so does the FBI. Oh, the Russian defector escapes too. (What IS a ""Russian defector"" anyway?) So, after the first five minutes a pursuit begins, with Jolie running through the streets in her bare feet, pursued by various agents of social control. Let me think. There are lots of bullets, a razor blade concealed in the tip of a boot, karate chops all over the place, cars careering down interstate highways, a motorcycle maybe, tear gas, and hand grenades. At the thirty-minute point, with my heart pounding and my tongue lolling out in a way Jolie's never does, I began to wonder how long this chase is supposed to last.<br/><br/>It lasts the entire 100 minutes. There are pauses now and then but just for a few seconds, not long enough for anyone to catch her breath but long enough for one or another character to explain why this next chase is about to take place. It's like pornography. The sex scenes have to be linked by SOME kind of phantasmic narrative before the brawny handyman and the glossy masseuse are hauled in.<br/><br/>Angelina Jolie is adequate in the part. I was never convinced of her acting ability, always distracted by that queer splanchnochranium and puffy collagenic lips and that inimitable rack of hers. She's unbelievable here, though not more so than the rest of the movie. She's given the powers of a superhero in a comic book. She can slide down ten floors of an elevator shaft just using some slots in the walls. (I won't even get into the rest of it.) <br/><br/>You know what was a good chase movie with political overtones? I thought ""The Bourne Identity"" was pretty good. It's not the genre that's offensive; it's the producers' conviction that if five minutes go by without somebody's head getting wrenched off, the audience will walk out. Okay, the less discerning viewers may ask why, if I detested this movie so much, I sat through it without my synapses being fused like those of any other ten year old. Maybe it was only through the seasonable interposition of a Gracious Providence that I alone am escaped -- to tell thee."
"JoeytheBrit","Null","3","6","28 June 2011"," Salt - As in 'to be taken with a pinch of...'
","About fifteen years ago the big screen became swamped with adaptations of comic book superheroes, both well-known and relatively obscure. One of the reasons for this was because filmmakers were able to take advantage of computer-generated effects whose sophistication rose in direct correlation to their drop in price. Today, with the superhero well more or less run dry, they've decided we no longer need to be fooled into believing the kid next door can develop super-powers when he's bitten by a radioactive spider. Hell, why go to such extreme lengths to justify the use of mind-blowing sfx? We'll just make the hero a medium-height, underweight woman who can balance on two-inch ledges ten floors up, leap from the roof of one moving container lorry to another, descend a lift shaft with acrobatic grace, emerge from a spectacular car smash without a limp or a grimace, and beat the crap out of trained men twice her size.<br/><br/>The movie Salt is wrong in so many ways and on so many levels that it's difficult to know where to begin. Cynicism abounds – from the writers who believe a protracted chase sequence lasting forty-five minutes is actually writing (lets face it, the film's first forty-five minutes probably used up maybe three pages of double-spaced script) and that inserting an increasingly ludicrous plot twist every five minutes will divert everyone's attention from all the other plot deficiencies, to the leading lady who undoubtedly knows a lucrative little franchise when she sees one. Philip Noyce directs with panache, but then he has to in order to paper over all the cracks.<br/><br/>In the film's defence, it's fair to say that probably nobody involved took it particularly seriously, and so the audience should really treat it the same way. Because it does provide a mindless entertainment, even though your neck will ache (unlike Evelyn Salt's) from all the shaking of your head as the audacious plot unfolds."

","I just checked the ""contains spoiler"" check-box so nobody complains about me telling people up front that this movie is the worst piece of work I have seen in a while.<br/><br/>It doesn't make any sense whatsoever. Not to mention the fact that this movie propagates an image of Russia that is far from reality, but hey, we're not looking for anything realistic, it's still an action movie, right? But get this (okay, now it's definitely a 'spoiler'): Miss Salt has a 'mission'. She's a trained agent, Russian intelligence. She's always been, ever since she was a kid. Now her boss wants her to make her move. Finally. So they (the Russians) blow her cover (wtf?!) and she's on the run and starts killing people. And of course she tries to complete her mission. Would it not have been a lot easier to let her make her move without blowing her cover first? The (inconsistent) plot reveals, that there is an even bigger mission behind the first one, which would have been a LOT easier to accomplish without her cover being blown in the first place, by her own people.<br/><br/>So: If the writers didn't think of that (very basic) hole in the entire logic of the film, don't bother looking for complexity. This movie is such a big mess.<br/><br/>When I came out of theater a year ago, I didn't only want my money back but also the time I wasted.<br/><br/>I am not giving one star, because camera and sound were great, but that's not the only thing movies are about.

The Russian plot was taken from some old graveyard and then a sex-change operation was carried out to convert Tom cruise into Angelina Jolie. Plot had many holes, but when did action movies had.

The plot and the actors made you grab your chair till the end with all the turns and twists. but Salt's vengeance was predictable.

In a film that runs about 100 minutes, probably 45 of them were car chases, foot chases and shoot 'em ups. I knew we were in for a rough ride when the first 40 minutes had a bunch of Keystone Kops trying to corral Jolie and it was all downhill from there. Given her limited dialogue, Jolie is not half bad, nor is her supporting cast; however, the movie made less and less sense as time went on and the finale (no spoiler here) did not lessen my feeling that I could have been doing something more productive with my time....like cleaning the litter box or emptying the dishwasher."

","Salt takes the serious note of national security and mixes the fantasy of the X-Men franchise.

No danger was ever truly conveyed to the audience as it didn't matter what peril our hero found him or herself in. <br/><br/>Character development was poor as the audience cared very little if our heroes of villains lived or died. We have no bonding to any of the characters or chemistry showing they were anything more than robots obeying orders.

","I enjoy the espionage genre, in the light of films like ""Taken"" and the like, but this came off as laughable. I thought Hollywood was done portraying Russians as America-hating, vodka-drinking terrorists, but I guess not. The film has a few good twists, but none so extraordinary that i was in awe. And a lot of the action scenes are so generic, predictable and annoyingly unrealistic. How many times have I seen a CIA agent who leaps off a freeway over pass and land son a convenient truck? Not to mention the constant one a gent who always pulls the trigger first, who always beats the sh*t out of fellow agents with moderate ease. You would think our government would give all their secret service members the same training so that one of them would not be superior to whole squads of others. Not only that, but I don't care how sexy Angelina Jolie is, can any woman really take all that abuse? I mean over all it's just a popcorn flick, but I just tire of all this.<br/><br/>A mediocre film I don't really recommend, unrated edition or not."
"Jonathon_Natsis","6","3","6","1 February 2011"," Getting' on a motorbike, Lookin' really ladylike
","The year was 1997. Modern-day megastar Angelina Jolie had yet to hit the big time, and had earnt her latest paycheck from appearing as a runaway escort in the music video for The Rolling Stones' Anybody Seen My Baby? (A lyric of which serves as the inspiration for this review's title). The clip was extremely well directed, and the song was, in this music- illiterate's opinion, the standout of their Bridges To Babylon album. <br/><br/>But I digress. There are many ways to describe the slightly above-average Salt, but Mr. Jagger puts it best. With this film, Jolie proves beyond doubt that no other actress can carry the weight of an action film with the poise and style that she possesses. In a similar fashion to her husband (but not quite to the same extent), Jolie's life has become so engulfed by the media that one can easily forget that acting skills that made her so famous in the first place. The plot is arguably the most inspired and enjoyable aspect of the film. A multitude of twists in the second half make it difficult to describe without giving away key details, but its outward originality is very refreshing in a genre typically lacking in new ideas. <br/><br/>Evelyn Salt is a CIA interrogator who becomes involved in a conspiracy theory concerning Russian sleeper spies planted in America almost fifty years ago. Needless to say, it requires an immense suspension of disbelief (none more so than when an explanation is given for the Russians being responsible for the murder of JFKwe all know it was the Mafia's idea) but it becomes increasingly enticing, even if it does lose its way a little at the end.<br/><br/>Jolie really does carry this film right from the opening scene. Aptly complemented by Schreiber, Ejiofor and Inglourious Basterds' August Diehl, this is the type of film that dosen't require the lead to overstretch their acting chops, but instead deliver where it counts: the pure entertainment department. With a performance that requires rapid personality changes to accommodate different scenarios, Jolie's character remains at the forefront of the action, and more than holds her own during the speedy but well-directed action scenes. And yes, she does look good doing it.<br/><br/>But Jolie does not deserve all of the credit with respect to the portrayal of the title character. Screenplay writer Kurt Wimmer, while not exactly delivering a groundbreaking script, has created a complex figure in Evelyn Salt. As the viewer, you'll find yourself constantly questioning her role in the story, even after her true identity is revealed.<br/><br/>As mentioned earlier, Salt begins to stray in the final scene, where the characters' motives are somewhat sacrificed in preference of an explosive, gun-toting finale, which comes dangerously close to filtering in an avalanche of crime-thriller clichés in the process. In fact, it becomes too convoluted for its own good. For a film that commences so promisingly and keeps up that air of intrigue during the Second Act, it feels as if director Phillip Noyce tried to pull an Inception, that is, putting together an ending so mind-bending it leaves everyone in the cinema talking long after the movie is over.<br/><br/>In that respect, the film fails. The outcome is needlessly complicated, and the process through which we get to that outcome makes less and less sense the more I think about it. Nonetheless, the film on the whole is, just like the apple strudel in Diehl's previous film, not terrible."

The action and car chases are quite original and well done.<br/><br/>In the second half the plot twists are unexpected and fun - a bit confusing but if you take the time to think about it, it does all fit together. Wish it had been a bit more clearly spelt out at the end to make it really obvious who everyone really was doing what to whom. Ending is a bit abrupt I wish it went on a bit longer. Took me about 20 minutes after the movie finished to figure it all out.

"alexart-1","7","3","6","14 August 2010"," Lacking Logic, but Filled with Cool Action
","It may have been a long Cold War, but Angelina Jolie is definitely quite hot. In Salt, Jolie does quite a bit of ass-kicking and also manages to give a good performance. Unfortunately, Jolie is unable to completely save Salt, which falls victim to the classic mistake of poor writing in the third act. Though it makes so little sense that it probably lowers one's IQ in the concise 99 minutes that it runs for, Salt makes for an enjoyable ride until the multi-twist finale that runs unnecessarily long.<br/><br/>Salt is named after the title heroine, Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie). Evelyn is happily married to her husband and enjoys a somewhat normal life as a CIA agent. And then one day she has a really bad day, one that rivals those that Jack Bauer manages to survive in ""24."" In an interrogation session, a Russian spy reveals a plot to assassinate the Russian Prime Minister, which is a part of an even larger plot to destroy the United States called ""Day X."" He also reveals that Evelyn is a Russian spy. Even though she claims this to be false, Evelyn stupidly decides to go on the run and murders quite a few people in the process. But is Evelyn really the person she seems to be? A great supporting cast includes Chiwetel Ejiofor and Liev Schreiber.<br/><br/>Angelina Jolie is responsible for many of the reasons why parts of this film are successful. Salt was originally named for Edwin A. Salt and Tom Cruise was set to play him. After reading the script, Tom Cruise felt his character was too similar to Ethan Hunt, his other character from Mission: Impossible, and detached himself from the film. And it is a great thing that he did. Jolie plays her role with so much intensity and mystique, something that women in action films can rarely pull off. At her best, Jolie acts with ferocity and sexuality, and that is just what she does in Salt's slick action sequences.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for Jolie, the story often falls flat. Although most action films (with the exception of movies like The Dark Knight and Inception) are not meant for people who are extremely smart, movies should still have a coherent and linear plot. Salt certainly lacks an understandable plot and, to make it worse, has absolutely no logic. The motivations are never clear for any character in the entire film and the plot twists around three too many times. It is obvious that Phillip Noyce, the director of two James Patterson adaptations, can stage a nice action sequence, but there has to be a stable plot to support a scene. Most of the time, Kurt Wimmer's mediocre script cannot support the intense action that unfolds on-screen. The last half hour of the film is so outlandish and unnecessary that it almost loses any respect from some audience members. Many viewers might not react positively to an ending that does not completely satisfy. (Note: A rumor is going around that a sequel is on its way.) <br/><br/>At times, Salt is exactly what is should be: a nice diversion. But at other times, it is so extremely nonsensical that it proves detrimental to the movie's overall effect. Angelina Jolie does her best as Evelyn Salt and almost always succeeds in surprising the audience, but a so-so script sometimes weighs her performance down. Salt mainly suffers when its story begins to unravel in the final half hour. The ending, unfortunately, lacks a punch, but the first hour is still good enough to keep the viewer high on an adrenaline rush throughout the entire movie. Even though Salt is not nearly as good as it should have been, it still remains an enjoyable experience."

"ruby_fff","7","3","6","5 August 2010"," One damn good action hero Jolie is, and in SALT, it felt like a female ""Jack Bauer 24"" type non-stop for the whole 100 minutes complete
","Yes, Angelina Jolie can very well be our lady James Bond, anytime. She has integrally proved in the superb Simon West directed ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"" 2001, and opposite Brad Pitt as the dynamic duo in ""Bourne Identity"" director Doug Liman's ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" 2005. From the Special Collector's Edition DVD behind the scenes, we learned that Jolie did her own stunts after rigorous physical training, that her agile moves were more convincing than stunt doubles. Impressively credulous - she embodies the character of Lara Croft and she is Lara Croft, The Tomb Raider, 100 percent (and beyond). And when she is Jane Smith, she is the unmistakable fearless lethal assassin just as her husband John Smith is. Jolie's star power, acting energy, physical and inner strength always intensely come through and through. As agent Evelyn Salt, she's no match for anyone - except Jack Bauer of '24'. I totally see her as the female equivalent to Jack, from the very first moment as SALT, the movie, opens.<br/><br/>As one famous film critic pointed out that SALT made RUN LOLA RUN (1998 w-d Tom Tykwer with Franka Potente of ""Bourne Identity"" being Lola) seem like mere walking for its 80 minutes. Jolie in SALT is constantly on the run (sprinting, leaping, jumping, running down, running up, running across), and her brain never stops as unbroken string of hindrances every which way are coming at her, trying to stop her dead, literally. Fear not, and it's no spoiler, Evelyn Salt is one determined agent, Russian or otherwise, out to defend the US of A (just as '24' Jack Bauer does at all costs, risking loved ones and sacrificing oneself consciously to get to the next step and to achieve the unswerving goal - save the world, too, while s/he's at it). There's many twists and turns. Convoluted? 'Nah'. It's standard espionage fare, cold war related, action-filled screenplay by competent ""Equilibrium"" (2002) w-d Kurt Wimmer. Director Phillip Noyce is no stranger to this genre, he had given us Harrison Ford's Jack Ryan in ""Clear and Present Danger"" (1994). It is Jolie whom you want to follow from beginning to end, and you badly wanted her to succeed, just as agent Salt does.<br/><br/>Accompany her, worry for her, cheer for her. Is she or is she not a Russian spy product - you would at times waver but no time to ponder. Her next move may reveal yet another level in the game plan, and you'd think how clever she is, or empathize with her for why she did what she did - she's already moved on. The story pacing is non-stop and there's no time for second-guessing who's the real bad guy and who can really help Salt. Is she truly on her own? If you want a good thriller and your money's worth for 100 minutes, Jolie's SALT is the best bet.<br/><br/>Music by James Newton Howard, along with director of photography Robert Elswit, editing team of Stuart Baird, John Gilroy and Steven Kemper, tightly delivered the scenes with earnest proficiency. Key supporting roles by Liev Schreiber as Ted, Salt's mentor (he's in ""A Walk on the Moon"" 1999 with Diane 'Unfaithful' Lane, ""Hamlet"" 2000, ""Defiance"" 2008 opposite James Bond Daniel Craig, among many others) and Chiwetel Ejiofor as agent Peabody (he's memorable in d- Stephen Frears' 2002 ""Dirty Pretty Things"" with Audrey 'Amelie' Tautou, and in last year's disaster-blockbuster of ""2012"").<br/><br/>By the way, w-d Christopher Nolan's ""Inception"" with stellar cast of DiCaprio, Cotillard, Page, Watanabe, Caine, Gordon-Levitt, including Cillian Murphy - is very much a mind-bending spiral tale of intrigue, psychological sci-fi if you will, while SALT is one continuous straight action-packed thriller helmed by Angelina Jolie from start to finish. Apples and oranges, not to be compared.<br/><br/>For a down to earth, cold war period Russian (and French) spy suspense and human drama, based on true events in the annals of US-French-Russian spy history, see ""Farewell"" aka ""L'affaire Farewell"" (2009), a worthy French film by director Christian Carion (of ""Joyeux Noel"" 2005), along the vein of ""The Lives of Others"" (aka ""Das Leben der Anderen"" 2006, German Oscar winner by w-d Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck) - a little known string of events yet critical to the 1989 fall of the Berlin Wall."
"Theothervip","Null","3","6","31 July 2010"," Outrageous but entertaining.
","My Rating: *** out of 4.<br/><br/>Ridiculous. Implausible. Derivative. Way over-the-top. I'd be surprised if it wasn't! No one really goes to a movie like SALT expecting it would be moving or intelligent. They expect a good time, and in just the right time to beat the heat. SALT is a gloriously goofy but ridiculously enjoyable thriller. Not a great comic thriller like a James Bond movie or a serious chase thriller like any of the Bourne pictures, but it's fun all the same even if, with all the silliness that ensues, it could have at least had characters that would have cracked a smile just a little bit.<br/><br/>Still, what it lacks in humorous and charismatic characters worthy of a James Bond, it more than makes up for it with the panache it gives to its action sequences. We've seen enough chases in action movies to last us a lifetime, and there's more than enough of those here in SALT. Not so much is added that it might as well establish itself as a remake/re-imagining of any other chase thriller or Cold War espionage plot ever made (which I think is what this movie really is). But to be fair, director Philip Noyce (a long-time action director) and writer Kurt Wimmer had me the moment Angelina Jolie suspects herself as a Russian spy and, tedious flashback sequences aside, never really lost me. Like so many other movies of its ilk, the plot is mostly a clothes-hanger which strings together a series of running scenes. And boy does Angelina run! And just to be dynamic, she jumps in a lot of things too, be it on the back of a passing truck (or three trucks) or an elevator shaft, Jolie's ankles must be aching with all the jumping she has to do in this movie.<br/><br/>The plot is a belated Cold-War paranoia where CIA agent Evelyn Salt (Jolie) is suspected by a defector as a commie, raised in Russia (along with other children) to be sent to America as a mole. A-huh. Yes, the plot is preposterous (but to be fair, it might appeal to any conspiracy buff who felt that they might have missed out on this one), but I'll be honest I was with it all the way, even if I was only holding my laughter a couple of times. The action sequences, whilst predictable and nonsensical at times, are exhilarating, and at 100 minutes it doesn't let up. Sacrificing any dramatic depth in the process, the movie just keeps on moving. It ain't art, and not at all different from a dozen action adventure movies I've seen in a long time, but it does play its part as a summer movie: It gives you all the requisite bells and whistles without having to insult you in the process."

Angelina Jolie delivers a fantastic role- leaving no doubt as to why she's made it to the top of Hollywood's actresses. She has a phenomenal presence on screen that keeps the movie intact and makes the twisted plot flow with ease. Liev Schreiber also delivers a great performance, though it's hard to get past his roles in Defiance and X- Men Origins: Wolverine. <br/><br/>There are plenty of twists, turns, car chases, crashes, blow up scenes, jumps, gun fire, and hands on fights to satisfy even the most dedicated action fans. The cinematic elements are great, the music is fitting, the scenes are well directed, the transitions aren't annoying, the plot flows well, the writing isn't overly corny, and the actors (primarily Angelina and Liev) are probably the best asset.<br/><br/>This movie gives you a total adrenaline rush, too. You get enveloped into the plot and the characters in a way that makes every scene exciting. It definitely keeps you guessing, despite the reveal in the trailer.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a great every day movie, and definitely one that I will buy for a few watches when it comes out on DVD and BluRay. Though it's not perfect (I didn't give it full stars because of a mistake in casting Hunt Block for the President's character, one poorly crafted special effects elevator scene, and a lack of proper costume design in the latter end of the movie that distracts from Angelina looking as fabulous as always), it's still great fun. <br/><br/>Don't miss it!"

'A Female Version Of Jason Bourne'<br/><br/>Undoubtedly people will compare this movie to the great 'Bourne' films. I don't think this is a bad thing personally. To say this movie has the same plot as the Bourne films would be untrue. There may be some similarities but at the end of the day if you watch the film to the end you will see the plots are only loosely similar. It does have a similar style to it though that the 'Bourne' films did very well.<br/><br/>2. 'It portrays Russia in a Bad Light'<br/><br/>Seriously, I don't understand how anyone can say that. The idea of this movie is to entertain, which it does. The movie is fictional, as in made up! So the films interpretation of Russia is irrelevant. In Action Movies 'Good versus Bad' is an important part of the plot to get you rooting for the Lead character. I'm sure there have been Russian films that have made the Americans out to be the bad guys. It's nothing personal, it just adds to the plot.<br/><br/>3. 'Plot Holes'<br/><br/>Anyone who has written reviews saying the plot has major flaws in my opinion is wrong. All you need to do is pay attention to the movie and watch it through to the end and everything will make sense. I actually enjoyed guessing the plot twists throughout the movie. Questioning the plot as you watch the movie isn't a bad thing it's simply done to make you keep wondering if she's good or bad.<br/><br/>4. 'Bad Ending'<br/><br/>I personally didn't see anything wrong with the ending, why not leave it open for a sequel? I definitely would like to see one or more. Why do some people think that everything has to be tied up in a neat little bow?! It doesn't have to be. The ending leaves it up to your imagination (something many of these 'bad' reviewers seem to be missing) as to what happens next or until they provide a sequel.<br/><br/>5. 'Jerky Camera Work'<br/><br/>The camera work and directing seemed to be spot on as far as I could tell. Why should the camera be stationary during fight sequences?! People move during fights so that means the camera has to also. Otherwise you'd end up with one dimensional fight sequences.<br/><br/>6. 'How can Jolie's slender character dispatch trained agents with such ease'<br/><br/>As referenced in the movie she is a HIGHLY TRAINED AGENT. With advanced hand to hand combat etc.. Special forces are trained how to take people out quickly, efficiently and use their opponents body weight against them. Also you see several times in the movie she gains leverage by jumping into the air and getting all her weight behind her punches/kicks. Which makes it not unreasonable to think she could knock someone out. As for them being trained agents the movie doesn't specify what level of combat training they have. You seriously think the average FBI/CIA operatives would be trained to the same level as a special forces field agent?! It's like saying an average sized Security Guard would be a match for a under sized expert martial artist. Her lesser weight class would not be an issue.<br/><br/>So those were my answers to some common complaints from narrow minded critics.<br/><br/>I highly recommend watching this movie. I've given it a 9/10 as it is a very good action film. You can't fault the Acting or Dialogue. The stunts are brilliant except one of the jumps from truck to truck was a bit to big to seem believable. The plot keeps you guessing the whole way through. Oh and of course who doesn't like seeing Angelina on the big screen?! Probably one of her best movies ever, second only to her superb performance in Changeling."

"Hellmant","8","3","7","14 October 2010"," It all really comes down to the Angelina Jolie show!
","'SALT': Four Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>Angelina Jolie, arguably Hollywood's hottest actress, returns to action form in this spy thriller directed by Phillip Noyce (director of such top notch action and suspense films as 'PATRIOT GAMES', 'CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER' and 'DEAD CALM'). This, sort of female version of a 'Jason Bourne' film, tells the tale of CIA 'super' agent named Evelyn Salt (Jolie) who's accused of being a Russian spy, with a mission to assassinate the Russian President, by a Russian defector (played by Daniel Olbrychski). Knowing that the love of her life, her husband (played by August Diehl), is at risk Salt evades capture and goes on the run. She uses all of her expertise and experience to try and save her husband, clear her name and stop the assassination. The film is full of twists as we learn more and more about the assassination plot and the mystery of Salt's true identity.<br/><br/>A lot has been publicized about how this film was originally written for a male lead and Tom Cruise was attached but he later turned down the role in order to do 'KNIGHT AND DAY', which many consider a big mistake considering 'SALT' is a much bigger financial hit than 'KNIGHT AND DAY'. Then it was rewritten for a female lead and Jolie was hired. I still think Cruise made the right choice; this is a better film than 'KNIGHT AND DAY' but that role was just more fitting for Cruise and a smarter choice for him at this stage in his career, regardless of how much money it makes. 'Salt' is a much more fitting role for Jolie. I'd much rather see a female lead in a serious 'balls to the wall' action film like this; it's more intriguing and a lot more fun. With that said who better than Jolie to play the role. She's an awesome action heroine, one of the best, and she definitely doesn't disappoint here. With this and 'WANTED' she has certainly established herself as the world's biggest female action star.<br/><br/>On top of Jolie's performance there's a really suspenseful and action packed script. It does get completely far fetched towards the end but the action is so hard, gritty and somewhat realistic, compared to a lot of CGI summer blockbusters like this, that it doesn't matter. The directing is perfectly fitting to the material and once again there's Jolie. The supporting cast is all adequate, including Liev Schreiber and Chiwetel Ejiofor, but it all really comes down to the Angelina Jolie show. She's never been sexier, at age 35, and she really knows how to put on an 'ass kicking show'. That's why she gets paid the big bucks. She's a Hollywood icon and this movie is a great example of why.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4rYA-j3f3c"

The movie gave me what I expected and what I wanted: 100 minutes of exciting action. It even threw in some unexpected plot twists that I never saw coming. When the credits finally rolled, I was surprised that 100 minutes had passed so quickly.

It was unpredictable until then and i was  confused too that whether she was going for his husband or to kill the  Russian president. fast forward the Russian president is apparently  killed by her and she ran from the custody of the police to the safe  house of Orlov, the leader of their organization and then he kills her  beloving husband in front of her. from that point on there wasn't a  single plot twist that i wasn't able to guess. I mean it was obvious  that she was gonna screw their ultimate Op in order to get revenge for  her husband. And then after very elaborate and death-defying adventure  she was able to reach the presidential bunker. I was also able to guess  that Winter might be the other one just because he was the only one  with an accent. And the ending was the most ridiculous when she tells  the guy that she is the only one who knows people more like winter, but  she didn't knew Winter was one of orlovs in the first place, that was  the most stupid plot twist for me and he lets her go free for that."

Promising. Sadly though, this is the point where I should have switched off my brain. The storyline is VERY simplistic and doesn't really care if it makes sense or not. The scenes jump from one action stunt to another but the bit that joins them together is really not there. If you leave your brain switched on then you will struggle to watch this. The laws of science and biology do not apply to this film and AJ seems to be made from Kevlar.

The reveal just leaves you thinking...Derrrrrrrr!!!!!<br/><br/>So to sum up; The story is nonsense, the action is full on but illogical, the characters are cliché and the ending is highly predictable and lazy.

"harry_tk_yung","Null","3","7","25 July 2010"," From Croft to Salt
","""Salt"" is an undistinguished but serviceable action thriller. The plot is simple (SPOILER, SPOILERS, Spoilers): a double agent – CIA agent and undercover Russia mole – flips again when the Russians kills her innocent husband as an expendable pawn. At the end of the story, the CIA agent who captured her let her slip away to take revenge – kind of ""Salt begins"". <br/><br/>The movie IS Angelina Jolie, first blond, then dark haired. Her CIA credentials list her expertise as: combat and explosives. Right away you can see what is coming. Whether it's attempting to assassinate the Russian president, the U.S. president, or to save the world from nuclear annihilation, the plot serves only as a platform for her to beat people up, blow things up and, in most cases, both. Although you have seen these chases, fights and firework millions of times on the screen, they still look good here, many say because of Jolie. While she deserves due credit, the cryptic edit work helps immensely. <br/><br/>The support cast is good, two in particular. If you are familiar with the theory of ""premium actors has a reason to be there"" (more spoilers), you know that just as Ben Kingsley wouldn't appear in ""Prince of Persia: The sands of time"" (2010) for such a mundane role that the king's brother initially appears to be, Liev Schreiber wouldn't be needed in ""Salt"" only as the dull, concerned boss of Evelyn Salt. The other is Chiwetel Ejiofor, looking as good as he ever was in ""Love actually"" and ""Melinda and Melinda"", tough CIA persona notwithstanding.<br/><br/>It seems that these days, no producer will accept a script that does not leave a possible sequel dangling at the end. Jolie has made it with the Lara Croft franchise. Now is as good as a time as any to move on. Salt is a distinct possibility, or so wish the movie makers."
"zardoz-13","Null","3","7","25 July 2010"," Loaded With Sodium!!!
","Angelina Jolie puts on her bad-girl, butt-kicking britches in ""Patriot Games"" director Phillip Noyce's espionage melodrama ""Salt"" and shows what one elite lady can do against greater numbers and outlandish odds. This electrifying, surprise-laden thriller resembles director Don Siegel's Cold War era actioneer ""Telefon"" (1977) where KGB agent Charles Bronson dealt with a similar threat from Communist sleeper cell agents awakened by a renegade Russian ready to ignite a nuclear war. The chief difference in ""Salt"" is that our attractive protagonist is one of the sleeper cell agents! Clocking in at a breathless 100 minutes, this edge-of-the-seat spy movie never exhausts its get-up-and-go. Our nimble, quick-witted, super-sexy heroine smashes anybody who defies her. In fact, nothing man-made can halt her. She is as much an inexorable force here as the male hit-man was in the Coen Brothers' epic ""No Country for Old Men."" No matter what either the C.I.A. or the N.Y.P.D. try to do to thwart her, Salt keeps on kicking. No situation is so foolproof that she cannot out-fox the opposition. Unfortunately, Noyce and ""Ultraviolet"" scenarist Kurt Wimmer sacrifice credibility as well as characterization along the way to maintain their high velocity. Eventually, at some point, you'd think somebody would throw caution to the wind and simply put some lead through Salt's head. Of course, this cannot happen because the movie would grind to an abrupt end. Watching ""Salt"" is the equivalent of reading a page-turning best-seller that you cannot put down. Moreover, ""Salt"" is the kind of thriller that requires your constant attention. Leave your seat for either the concession stand or the restroom and you will find yourself baffled when you return. Believe it or not, Tom Cruise turned down this thriller to make ""Knight and Day."" <br/><br/>""Salt"" opens like the James Bond thriller ""Die Another Day."" C.I.A. agent Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie of ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"") has fallen into the hands of the North Koreans, and they interrogate and torture her for information that she refuses to divulge under any kind of pressure. The evil North Koreans cry uncle and exchange Salt for one of their agents that the Americans have. Salt learns from her superior, C.I.A. agent Ted Winter (Liev Schreiber of ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine""), that her German arachnologist husband, Mike Krause (August Diehl of ""Inglourious Basterds""), exerted maximum pressure to effect a prisoner exchange. No sooner has our considerably relieved heroine flown back to Washington than another crisis occurs. As she is about to leave the building, an older Russian walks into the agency and gives himself up. Before the C.I.A. does anything else, they decide to grille him. Since Salt is fluent in Russian, she handles the interrogation while Winter and fellow C.I.A. agent Peabody (Chiwetel Ejiofor of ""2012"") watch her through a one-way window. Orlov (Daniel Olbrychski of ""Tin Drum"") explains that a sleeper cell of highly trained agents is going to murder Russian President Matveyev (Olek Krupa of ""The Italian Job"") when he attends the funeral of the Vice President in New York City. Moreover, Orlov elaborates that these agents were indoctrinated from childhood and boast skills that make them unstoppable. Worse, he puts the finger on Evelyn.<br/><br/>Naturally, Salt denies Orlov's allegations, and Winter throws up his hands in disgust when Peabody puts too much stock in Orlov's story. Salt's case is not helped when a C.I.A. technician observes that Orlov breezed through the lie detector test without a glitch. Winter is prepared to overlook these outrageous allegations, but Peabody shows greater reluctance. When Peabody tries to arrest her, Salt slips through his hands and eludes every security guard and lockdown procedure in the building. Salt plunges into D.C. traffic and moves by leaps and bounds from one truck to the next with the C.I.A. smoking tires at her heels. This is one of those thrillers where nothing is impossible for the heroine. She can cling to a high-balling, 18-wheeler in rush hour traffic with one hand and can dive from one vehicle on a higher level of a clover leaf overpass to another vehicle beneath without a care in the world. Coincidence is her best ally. Salt can do no wrong.<br/><br/>This abbreviated synopsis will have to suffice for the time being. Revealing the surprises that ensue would sabotage the suspense and tension that Noyce and Wimmer generate with this PG-13 adventure. There are moments when Salt imitates the TV troubleshooter MacGyver and constructs a weapon with items lying around that are not practical weapons. The problem with all of this is that any alert audience member will spot the holes that Noyce and Wimmer do a fairly decent job of concealing. Several inexplicable moments occur that bother Peabody while Winter never stops defending Salt against the accusations, no matter how far out on a limb our heroine dances. ""Salt"" isn't a performance-oriented spectacle. Too many things happen and the revelations that keep pace with these changes are designed to make you think one way while the filmmakers are setting up their next surprise. At another point, only when the villain decides to launch a nuclear warhead against the Arabs does ""Salt"" look like a post-Cold War thriller. While Noyce's movie surpasses Jolie's two ""Tomb Raider"" flicks, ""Salt"" isn't as interesting as either ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" or the equally audacious ""Wanted."""
"judywalker2","6","3","7","25 July 2010"," Just a little bit better than okay
","I love Angelina Jolie as a 'kick-ass' female superhero. She usually fits the bill just great i.e. Tomb Raider and Mr. and Mrs. Smith, but there was something missing in her performance in this film. Maybe it was too serious. Instead of her normal tongue and cheek were just got more and more close ups of her big, bigger lips. She has no good dialog after the opening interrogation scenes and I agree with some of the others who say she look extremely thin, almost anorexic. The supporting cast is okay mostly just giving out one liners between the action sequences. I wish they had copied the Bourne movies a little more and gave Salt more character, though the many flashbacks help some, we only learn her motivation at the very end. That makes for a long, even though it's short- 100 minutes, less than satisfying movie experience."
"gregeichelberger","5","3","7","23 July 2010"," Decent action/adventure with stellar cast
","I had my trepidations about seeing Angelina Jolie take on another female swashbuckling role like she did in ""Laura Croft: Tomb Raider"" or ""Wanted,"" but after viewing Phillip Noyce's ""Salt,"" I was indeed pleasantly surprised. Not too much, mind you, but enough to give the movie a slight recommendation.<br/><br/>Pleasantly surprised is, by the way, an emotion I am not used to while attending many films these days.<br/><br/>Noyce, who directed ""Patriot Games,"" ""Clear and Present Danger,"" ""The Quiet American"" and ""Catch a Fire,"" among other pictures, does a fairly good job in setting up the plot and letting the action sweep you along until a few twists (some good, some not so) hurl us towards the somewhat haphazard conclusion.<br/><br/>Speaking of twists, while I could see the main one coming from a mile away, I was still not too disappointed because the derring-do and escape scenes were quite well done. And although it came close to becoming ""The Manchurian Candidate"" (the 1962 version, thank you) meets the Bourne film series meets ""Children of the Damned,"" there was enough originality and action to keep me glued to the screen.<br/><br/>Some critics have called it banal and hokum, but for my money, there isn't much else out there for adults other than ""Inception,"" so for now, I'll bide my time until ""Dinner For Schmucks"" comes along. <br/><br/>The story has Jolie as Evelyn Salt, a CIA agent who happens to an expert in Russian affairs. That's funny, because while interrogating a former Soviet bigwig, Orlov (Daniel Olbrychski, ""Break Point""), she is accused of being a Russian spy — in front of her superior, Ted Winter (Liev Schreiber, ""Taking Woodstock,"" ""The Manchurian Candidate,"" 2004 version) and FBI honcho, Peabody (Chiwetel Ejiofor, ""Inside Man,"" ""American Gangster"").<br/><br/>Sensing the possibility that she might be a mole, Peabody plans to give her the third-degree, but she's too smart for that, becoming a female MacGyver, building a homemade bazooka out of a table leg and some cleaning fluid. <br/><br/>She then takes a powder to search for her German national husband, Michael (August Diehl, ""Inglourious Basterds""). She finds he's been kidnapped and then finds out she was born in the USSR, indoctrinated to hate America and then sent to live in the US as a child.<br/><br/>Orlov also told her that she would assassinate the Russian president, so she goes through with it — right in the middle of the US vice president's funeral. Captured by police, Evelyn stages more incredible escapades, one, in which she forces a New York City police officer to drive her getaway car by constantly tasering him, does push the bounds of incredulity just a bit too far ...<br/><br/>Peabody, meanwhile, is chasing after her like Sam Gerard after Dr. Richard Kimble, wanting nothing more than to blow her away. Winter, on the other hand, has worked with Salt and cannot believe she is involved in such shenanigans. <br/><br/>Neither can we. It just doesn't seem right with Jolie being a Russian killer and trying to foment a war between the two superpowers. But, then just about the time we think she might be the bad guy, she does a 180 and offs a bunch of Soviet espionage agents on a barge in the East River.<br/><br/>One could get whiplash from the plot jolts here. And don't even get me started on the spastic nature of the conclusion.<br/><br/>Look, this movie is not about to win any awards, but is competent enough to entertain (I did not write ""enlighten"") for its relatively short running time of 100 minutes. Schreiber pretty much phones this one in and Jolie is appropriately gritty and stoic, using her pouting lips and high cheekbones to her advantage as a Russian waif/super secret agent.<br/><br/>The best performance here is Ejiofor. Although not given a whole lot to work with, he manages to be compelling enough whenever on screen to illicit audience interest."

She either should put more mussels on herself or this role should be given to a male like Mat Damon who is more believable on this kind of role. I don't believe that she is a good actress either.

None of the characters were particularly likeable, you only really started to like Jolie's character by the end. My other issue was that I think I've seen one too many thrillers, because I was constantly questioning whether she's been set up or who it could be etc. When really, I needed to just watch the action for what it was. It's a simple plot, nothing difficult to understand about it at all. The characters would do questionable things as well which would bother me.<br/><br/>Overall it's not too bad, I didn't hate it at all. But, I feel as though they could have done more with the plot and the characters. I watched because it's on top 10 on Netflix UK so I know plenty of English people will be debating this. Chuck it on if you like action films, just don't expect anything drastic."

"alexandercappelli","7","2","4","26 January 2015"," Finally a decent female lead action film
","'Salt' shouldn't be a particularly noteworthy film. It's a decent action/thriller with a few twists and turns (especially the Director's Cut version) that will keep you entertained and intrigued till the credits roll. When it's all said and done 'Salt' is just another film in an overcrowded genre that includes successfully entries such as the Bourne series, Mission Impossible films, the never ending Bond franchise and standalone films like The Departed and Body of Lies. However, there is a key difference here, only one of these films features a female protagonist. What makes the character of Evelyn Salt an important female figure in the action genre is not what she does so much as what she doesn't do. She doesn't wear skin tight leather, high heels or other impractical clothing for a CIA agent, she doesn't use her body to seduce her male counterparts, she doesn't require rescuing from a more experienced, stronger male character. Yes, Angelina Jolie is an attractive woman, she could be described as sexy, but she is not, in this film at least, a sexualised object of male desire and there is a world of difference between the two. It's interesting to note that the character she plays was originally written for a man, Tom Cruise to be precise, then later changed to a woman. This is reminiscent of the origins of the character of Ellen Ripley in the Alien franchise who was written as a man. While there was a slight change in pronoun to accommodate actress Sigourney Weaver, not a single line of dialogue changed from the original script. Ripley is arguably one of the best, it not the finest example of a non-sexualised strong female character in an American action/sci-fi film and it's perhaps due to the fact that she was written as a man. Being written as a man she comes across as strong willed, independent, ambitious, physically tough and aggressive, all qualities that are very rarely attributed to American female film stars. In a perfect world, 'Salt' would not warrant an overly wordy review or require any particular attention. However, due to the misogynist and sexist culture that permeates our patriarchal society it is significant when a film comes out of the Hollywood machine that features a female lead that is treated with respect and is presented to be just as capable as the men that dominate her world."

","I didn't really know what to expect from this movie but it sounded interesting, so I gave it a shot. The movie features good action, plot twists throughout and it keeps you guessing. A lot of people are talking about how unrealistic it is but that's what movies are for. I like watching people kicking butt & being heroes and that's what we get. Angelina held her on fighting & shooting people. I don't care for the ending but it left open the possibility for a sequel. The concept of kids being trained to integrate into society & eventually attack America is scary! It seems wild but realistic considering the whacko America haters out there preying on people"
"Vartiainen","Null","2","4","16 September 2014"," Excellent action spy thriller
","I've said it before and I'm saying it again. Angelina Jolie is the only believable action superstar that also happens to be a woman. She simply has the capacity and the sheer presence to sell us all these roles without in any way taking away from the badassery because of her gender. Quite often we see action movies with female leads that have been watered down because they tried to emphasize the femininity of the character. And that's simply not what we want from a classical action movie.<br/><br/>Not Jolie though. Her characters are badasses without any doubt. Oh sure, there are touches here and there that show she's a woman - she's not trying to be more masculine than she normally is - but they're so minimal and so natural that they feel believable. There's no forcing in her performance, it's just who she is.<br/><br/>Aside from that Salt also succeeds in its action scenes and its central story, which is over the top and more than a bit silly, I admit, but so are most beloved action classics. It's the serious execution, with just the right amount of tongue in cheek, that makes these kinds of films work and in that regard Salt succeeds beautifully.<br/><br/>I'm really hoping they will make a sequel for this, because it's a really good action film with a great leading actress. More stuff like this, please!"

","The movie was really enjoyable. I confess I am a huge action fan, so SALT really ticked quite a few boxes for me. The action scenes and stunts are beautifully crafted, and it was even better that most of the stunts were actually performed live, giving a sense of improved realism to the movie.<br/><br/>However, what wasn't so good was that the plot for the movie was not exactly satisfactory. I won't give any spoilers here, but the general plot is that CIA agent Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie) goes on the run after being incriminated as a Russian spy. The entire plot, however, did have quite a few holes, and sometimes does require suspension of disbelief. Angelina Jolie's acting was very good, and it pulled the entire movie up. The performances by the supporting cast was also not bad. <br/><br/>I recommend the movie, as though it may not be the best in character development and the script, it does have many redeeming points, and is worth a watch if you happen to have an afternoon to spare."

The film had a panel at the San Diego Comic-Con on July 22 and was released in North America on July 23, 2010, and in the United Kingdom on August 18, 2010. Salt grossed $294 million at the worldwide box office and received mixed-to-positive reviews, with praise for the action scenes and Jolie's performance, but drawing criticism on the writing, with reviewers finding the plot implausible and convoluted. The DVD and Blu-ray Disc were released December 21, 2010, and featured two alternate cuts providing different endings for the movie."
"hypersonic8999","5","2","4","1 February 2012"," Another amazing plot ruined by the Hollywood obsession of the ""good"" side winning
","OK, let's start with the positives: - Amazing action - Awesome acting - Very good plot in most parts of the movie, except for the last third part of it<br/><br/>That's about it. Now let's go to the negatives, which is mainly THE PLOT. Kurt Wimmer has the ability to write amazing plot lines, always making the audience wonder what is going on and if the motives of the protagonists are actually valid or not. However, somehow he always ruins the ending by miraculous acts of gods, ridiculous mistakes done by the ""bad guys"" and impossible feats done by the ""good guys"" that usually defy every law of physics. My bone with this movie is that it had the potential of being a great action film, but it's ruined completely by the obsession of Hollywood to make the ""good guys"" (usually Americans) win under any circumstances. I will address some of the main issues I have with the plot here.<br/><br/>First off, the russians, for absolutely no reason at all, kill Angelina Jolie's husband, as an attempt to make her sever all ties she had with her previous life, but instead (obviously) making her angry and killing them all, when they could have ensured her loyalty by simply keeping the guy as a hostage, as logic dictates.<br/><br/>Then, we have Ted Winter (who is the loyal Russian spy here) making the mistake of killing everyone in the White House bunker EXCEPT the president, who is not needed alive anyway, and who could compromise the whole Russian scheme if he walked out of the room and either cancelled the nuclear strike or could point out of Ted Winter being a Russian spy instigating world war 3. He wakes up to assist Salt in eliminating Winter. Why oh why did you not kill EVERYONE Winter?<br/><br/>Finally, the biggest problem of all, is that the American nuclear missile strike took almost 15 minutes to prepare out of which 15 minutes it was stuck at 99% for 14 minutes. How can a missile strike stick at 99%? Where they installing Windows or smth? It was ridiculous. Furthermore, a nuclear strike takes about 1 minute to launch, from the time the presidential order is given and is irreversible unless another presidential order is given. If there was really a war, the US would have been a smouldering pile of nuclear ashes. The real reason that thing took so long, was to give time to Salt to enter the bunker and proceed to kick Winter's ass and save the day. (btw she entered the bunker by destroying lead-reinforced concrete that was able to withstand multiple nuclear explosions).<br/><br/>As a result we have an awesome action movie ruined by ridiculous plot holes. You will probably enjoy the action, but don't get your hopes up in terms of plot. This is not the ""female"" Jason Bourne movie. This is a far inferior movie to any other spy film I've ever watched."
"ngmb","5","2","4","25 December 2011"," Fairly good, but not as good as I had expected
","Salt was a fairly decent Action film. Another one of those films where somebody has been set-up for a crime that they supposedly didn't commit. Salt got off to a good start when Evelyn Salt, and her CIA colleagues that she is a Russian spy and is going to be assassinating the president of Russia that afternoon, at the funeral of the Vice-President of The United States. When it some form of truth detector says that he is telling the truth the CIA workers get nervous. Then Salt escapes and the action kicks in! Salt was filled with many surprises, and kept me guessing until the end. There were some holes in the plot line which should have been filled and by the end of the film there were a few questions I had that were unanswered, as well as the ending, where it was very intense and I was wondering, ""what is going to happen?"", and then all of a sudden then credits were rolling and I was left very confused. But I have heard that there is a planned sequel that is to be released in 2014 which I will definitely be going to see. In the end Salt was an entertaining action flick, with some excellent, interesting ideas, but it didn't end up going where it wanted to. Rate: 7/10"
"Fa-Rehse","3","2","4","23 August 2011"," Extremely predictable
","I usually enjoy action flicks a lot, and I love spy-movies, even the more pathetic and overdrawn ones like the James Bond series. So well, I thought Salt was right up my alley.<br/><br/>First off: The movie is a highly polished AAA title with all that comes with it. Family friendly dialogue (no swearing), practically no gore (some blood here and there), no sexual content. So far, so good. Unfortunately, this general direction was kept when it comes to plot quality - Side-characters are stereotypes, scenery and sets are cliché overkill, the obligatory love story doesn't get you attached at all. Depth? - Nada.<br/><br/>***Spoilers***<br/><br/>While this would all be excusable in an action-packed popcorn-movie with guns, agents and inter-truck-jumps, one thing is not: Salt obviously wants you to keep guessing which side the protagonist is on, since the movie is built around the double agent idea of sleeper agents with waterproof cover living in the US for practically their entire life. <br/><br/>Well, the movie fails gloriously at this. Evelyn Salt doesn't kill a single US-American in the whole movie. Ever. Moreover, she knocks US citizens out, at great risk and in grotesque ways, just to spare their lives. So it's crystal clear right off the bat that she is in some way or the other, working for the US. And it stays that way until the end. The rest of the plot (which is a whooping 60 minutes long) unfolds exactly as you'd expect. The guy that wanted her dead is actually the good guy; Her best friend is actually *drums*, the bad guy. Why she did it? - Love, of course. It's an American movie after all. <br/><br/>Overall far below other action/spy AAA thrillers like the Bourne series or Bond and eons behind really good spy movies like ""Body of Lies"" (which actually provides questions instead of a bucket-load of answers you never wanted to hear, like Salt)."
"rahilsp","5","2","4","12 August 2011"," All action, no substance
","This film is quite simply the Angelina Jolie show. It seems like the makers of this film just had $110 million dollars to blow and spent most of it on stunts and forgot about the plot. I knew from the first minute that Salt was going to be poor, it just had bog standard spy film written all over it.<br/><br/>This film is clichéd in so many ways. We hear some rubbish about some baby who was alive then dead then alive again and some secret Russian spy program. All of this is just stupid and complicates the plot. Most of it though is just Angelina Jolie doing stunts . For the first half of the film all that really happens is that Evelyn Salt makes some makeshift explosive, scales some buildings and jumps about on some lorries. I have also never seen Russians depicted in such a stereotypical manner. They just drink vodka and carry machine guns around.<br/><br/>The storyline then just gets more stupid. For instance, we find out that although at first the Russina president was confirmed dead he was actually just paralyzed by her husband's spider venom. How convenient that he discovered a spider with the capabilities to do that. I'm sure also that many doctors would make that mistake of confirming a president dead. There are more revelations such as another one of the CIA agents also being a Russian mole who of course ends up fighting Salt. However, as always Angie saves the day by saving the world from nuclear war when the missiles are 99% ready.<br/><br/>This film is just badly thought out. OK, it may be entertaining on some levels but this is limited as the storyline is so bland. If you're not an action fan, I would definitely advise you to stay away from this film."
"anthonydavis26","Null","2","4","3 August 2011"," Some people must like Angelina and action more than a plot
","How I have entitled this review is, at any rate, the only basis on which I can understand anyone seeing this film as other than a more or less complete waste of time (there are three versions on the DVD - this review is based on the director's cut). And yet more people have given it five stars than one to three stars put together: they must like the actress or the action so much that they can forgive the fact that, in trying to surprise, the plot just doesn't work. <br/><br/>Oh, I did like energy of the trailer (which, as far as I remember, just featured Angelina Jolie with dark hair, and so couldn't have taken footage from the first half), and I know that action in action films doesn't have to be totally credible, so I decided to buy the DVD to watch as a bit of excitement. That said, her jumping eight floors down a lift-shaft from one set of girders to another several girders down (and not being heard or hurt), for example, is a bit unlikely, as is, however fit one is supposed to be, running (as she does in her other hair colour) long distances with what turns out to be a very heavy load, whilst wearing a thick coat and a knitted hat, without once breaking sweat. (Ladies don't sweat?) <br/><br/>But it is the plot from which no amount of action, or liking for the looks of Angelina (who, in the trailer, had been striking with her long dark appearance, but the trailer doesn't even appear to be on the DVD), can draw one's attention - with a film concerning agents, one knows that there is scope for betrayal, and for misplaced trust, but, to my mind, agents can only double- or triple-cross for so long before one's interest in whose side anyone is 'really' on must surely wane, and, with it, the desire to see the action unfold. <br/><br/>In the dialogue, there are even attempts to justify earlier actions whose appropriateness to whatever that person was trying to achieve (which itself did not really make any sense) is wholly dependent on Salt making escapes in the most implausible circumstances: looking back, they could never have been envisaged by the speaker at that time. For none of the rest of the film could have happened without Salt: escaping from a barricaded room in a most unlikely way and against all the odds; having been allowed to get out of the building and home with time to get together whatever she wanted; and then not having been caught when trying to run away again, not even when cornered with her hands up. The ineptitude that allows her to get where she does, and then just disappear, beggars belief! <br/><br/>The most striking visual indication that the director is attempting to make one trust characters and their motivations being true, only to seek to surprise by changing them, is the switch in hair colour. In that persona, Salt carries out actions to satisfy someone else that she herself should be trusted, one of which, in relation to her husband, she need not have done (since she regularly overpowers a whole host of armed men, and, in this case, does so shortly afterwards anyway), and the other of which (as an attempt to surprise not only us, but her latest set of colleagues) beggars belief - unless they didn't happen to be in on the plot, they would not have pronounced someone alive who had mysteriously been found not to be dead, since they wanted him to have been assassinated by their enemy's forces. <br/><br/>Couple this with the wayward (and unexplained) behaviour of a character with whom (also in a somewhat unlikely way) she had had a shared childhood, and a flimsy attempt, made in the closing voice-over in the same connection, to cast doubt on the new presidential figure (how has he been appointed, since this film seems to overlook the convention that the vice-president takes over when something happens to the president?), and there is just such a mess that nothing redeemed it for me."

Frankly don't start connecting dots and criticizing on the images portrayed of Russia as its just a fiction meant solely for the purpose of entertainment.

","Nothing is worse than a movie that uses an outdated premise, cliché villains, yet takes itself very, very seriously. Salt does all things and does them poorly (and it doesn't help that I think Angelina Jolie is a freak).<br/><br/>Apparently, decades ago, the KGB (remember them from 1980's spy movies?) took young orphans and trained them to be super spy sleeper agents in countries around the world and now, twenty years after the fall of the wall, they are being activated to destroy America once and for all......yeah, I thought it was gay too. Anyway, Angelina Jolie works for the CIA as America's top super spy, little does anyone know she is really a Russian super spy posing as an American super spy who is actually not posing as the American super spy but really is, confused yet? Don't worry, Angelina's identity confusion is the least of your worries in this film, mostly because everybody else with any kind of part in the film is also suffering from ""sleeper agent syndrome"" apparently they are everywhere, pretty good for a country that couldn't get adequate supplies of toilet paper to the general populace.<br/><br/>The final grand plan is to nuke Tehran and Mecca with U.S. nukes to incite the Muslim world to destroy America (not real sure how they would do that, seeing as how we just blasted the crap out of Iraq and Afghanistan without really breaking a sweat but just go with it). The plan to get the nukes is about as far fetched as you can get, but so was the assassination of the Russian president earlier in the film, as were the three escape sequences, and well pretty much the rest of the film so I suppose breaking into the White House command bunker during lockdown fits right in. Salt makes little to no sense, feels incredibly behind the times, and just plain sucks."

For the first 25 minutes there's all setup with no action, which I could have accepted if once the bullets started flying I found it entertaining. But somehow even the action sequences felt sluggish, and the are intercut with flashbacks and terse discussions that belie the trailer's promise of non-stop action. Instead this is stop and start action, and even during the most hectic parts it feels labored and dreary.<br/><br/>Perhaps the problem is how seriously the movie takes itself. It's a ridiculous story with unconvincing plot elements and unsurprising twists, but the film acts like it's very grim and important, as though the director simply couldn't accept that at best his movie could be a fun piece of fluff.

It is a clever way to engage the audience, but the fact is, that this is something that is not resolved in the end, as if to point to a sequel. Also, Angelina Jolie's poor performance as Salt will confuse the audience as to Salts emotions and actual reactions to scenarios and events.<br/><br/>While Jolie's acting is sub-par and the movie suffers for it, her character is worse. Salt is a cross between Jason Borne and James Bond and it is painfully obvious at times which character she has been written at, and this delivers the audience with inconsistencies throughout the film and it gets frustrating. <br/><br/>Sadly, the direction also gets a mention for lacking. It happens throughout, making the movie look messy and the supporting characters look like idiots, but when you watch this movie, you will notice all these things for yourself.<br/><br/>In the end, this was a great a concept, with a fair, yet foreseeable plot twist at the end. It was the execution that let it down. It could have been done in a much more compelling way. Angelina Jolie seemed to have put in a fair bit of effort for her character, but she still needed a lot of development.<br/><br/>Now, for the worst part. The end suggests there could be a sequel.

"sddavis63","9","2","4","31 March 2011"," Angelina Jolie Pulls This Off!
","I confess that I went into this with doubts about Angelina Jolie's ability to be believable in this role - but I have to admit that my doubts were wrong. She pulled off the role of Evelyn Salt absolutely perfectly. Evelyn was an American child raised in Russia after the death of her parents, who worked for the U.S. Embassy. Trained to be a Soviet agent, she was repatriated to the United States as part of a Soviet plot to bring the United States to its knees at an undefined future date, and eventually (and, yes, too conveniently, ends up as a CIA agent, exactly as the Soviets had planned for her). Apparently the demise of the Soviet Union didn't result in the demise of the plot, which is eventually put into action and leads to a movie that - in addition to the great performance by Jolie - has sustained excitement, a lot of tension, plot twists galore and a completely bewildering cast of characters, of whom you can never be sure which are the good guys and which are the bad guys. In short, you're guessing all the way through this and really you have no way of knowing exactly how this is going to end.<br/><br/>There are several truly unsettling moments scattered throughout this. Perhaps the two that stood out for me were the opening sequence in which Evelyn is tortured by the North Koreans after she's arrested as an American spy, and the scene in which Evelyn has to watch her husband die without being able to help him (and, indeed, having to pretend that she was completely unfeeling about it). The movie has some excellent action scenes scattered throughout. Yes, many of them are rather unbelievable (the scenes in which she jumps from truck to truck to truck to escape her CIA pursuers, and that where she takes over the police van stand out to me) - but that is, after all, the nature of the action genre. There's also a lot of pretty typical shootout action - which again means pretty unbelievable as Evelyn takes out pretty much everyone, but it's all well choreographed and truly exciting, and again it's the nature of the genre.<br/><br/>I don't know if there's a plan for a sequel, but the ending of the movie certainly sets us up for a potential sequel. I'd watch it. This was a truly enjoyable, exciting and unpredictable movie. (9/10)"

However, this film lacks a solid, structured story, and even some character motivation.<br/><br/>One minute Salt is a loyal CIA agent. The next, the CIA turns on her as a Russian in an interrogation room tells the agents Salt is a Russian spy. Really? Believe the Russian in the interrogation room over a loyal agent? And guess what, she is a spy. Later on she fulfills killing her target and then she turns on her own comrade-in-arms and saves the world for destruction. Uh? I'm confused. It seems that the screenwriters can't make up their minds. Liev Schreiber being a villain is also obvious—it has come to the point of being a cliché. Despite all of the mindlessness in plot and Salt's sudden twist of loyalty, betrayal, and loyalty, the movie wasn't too terrible. Why? The pointless action was enough to satisfy me. <br/><br/>My rating: 2.5/4<br/><br/>If there's going to be a sequel, it should be titled ""Pepper."""
"michel-linschoten","5","2","4","14 December 2010"," A movie with questions in the end.
","OK here goes like always my reviews, start with no plot synopses and my English gram is not that of a high standards.<br/><br/>Anyways, so far ppl seem to like my reviews as it put things into understandable words. Salt, when i read the title and saw Angelina Jolie i was already thinking to myself ""owwk this could be a so so movie"" The movie starts of pretty OK! She gets beaten to a pulp! OK that was a joke you may laugh. No but it seemed OK pretty cool, it was a ""shocking"" opening i like that. Made me feel like ""owk this could be one of those really coldharded espionage flicks i like so much.<br/><br/>As the movie prolonged, miss salt is supposedly a double agent, and she is the one to eliminate the president. Then as very predictable her Superior officer/friend of the CIA is a double agent to and figures out salt is double crossing it all. So the windup in a standoff..<br/><br/>Well i was hardly impressed, i predicted in mmm 40 min of the movie if not sooner that her boss is a Russian double agent as well. In case she fails to obvious. Then at the end i have loads of questions.<br/><br/>1 OK KA is a special program were kids got trained for YEARS, to plan this attack? Whatever happened to free-will ? Hard to believe that the put kids into a country the will attack in 15 years AND STILL OBEY. That does not make sense.<br/><br/>2 Salt past, is virtually not shown AT ALL, her character is to shallow and lacking depth throughout the entire movie who is she? What happened? How did she get into the states to do that what she was meant for.<br/><br/>3 The agent helps her escape in the end, making him indirectly a killer by letting go a assassin that will kill the bad guys. why!? OK we all know folks, its just movie and yes its just a movie meant to entertain. I was entertained but not overly joyed by these plot holes. The movie was finished and i was like wait min ! What about this and that :/ The movie is fun as a cheap action movie without to much given thought. Do not expect high plot developing or insanely well made espionage movie-making. Just pure action and thats it.<br/><br/>I give it a skinny 5, nice concept by to unlikely to be realistic even if we wanted it to be."
"MovieProductions","6","2","4","3 August 2010"," Now don't you feel ""Salt""-y?
","**1/2 out of (****)<br/><br/>After the trailer debut of ""Salt"" worldwide audiences started to groan because they thought, ""That's just another Angelina Jolie movie where she kicks butt and takes names, *sighs*. Despite some mixed reception from global audiences, ""Salt"", surprisingly gained positive feedback from the critics. While the reviews weren't as mind-blowing as say ""Inception"", most consisted of mild recommendations. Where do I fall in line? I found ""Salt"" to be an enjoyable summer blockbuster that is truly the epitome of pure escapist fun. However, let's not get too carried around here, ""Salt"" is highly flawed and only serves as a mild recommendation. Nevertheless, ""Salt"" still comes off as a decent film that boasts great performances and a break-neck pace. <br/><br/>""Salt"" revolves around a CGI agent who accuses ""Salt"" (Jolie) of being a Russian spy. The government is all over ""Salt"" after this accusation which alarms them. However, ""Salt"" escapes from the government in hopes to find her missing husband, prove her right identity, and stay undercover. Although, the question is, is Salt a Russian spy or is it just a false accusation?<br/><br/>First off, the performances are certainly great. Angelina Jolie is amazing as our action heroine and does her job. Liev Schreiber is also great because of how relatable he is in tight situations and how his performances comes off very authentic. Lastly, Chiwetel Ejiofor is great in this film because he plays the suspicious Peabody and his performances is very realistic. Moreover, this film is paced very briskly. When the film's resolution came, I asked myself, ""Is it over already?"". Yes, the film is paced so fast that the film feels like half of its running time (which is short in itself) and it feels so quick because it's very indulging. Furthermore, the cinematography is certainly eye-popping and captures the tone and puts a small emphasis on the big budget. Additionally, the action is non-stop so as to not bore the viewer.<br/><br/>While the pros outweigh the cons, there are still flaws. First off, while the action set pieces are cool, they are slightly disappointing. Every time action graces itself onto the big screen, there are major cut-aways, so sometimes, it's very difficult to follow the action. In addition, the story is pretty weak. The premise is very paint-by-numbers, despite some twists. Moreover, this film starts out with a bang and ends with a whimper. The first half is a pretty slick action thriller and then the second half loses some steam and doesn't live up to its predecessing fifty minutes. Also, the ending is very predictable. Lastly, while this film is supposed to be mindless, there are some scenes that go so over-the-top, they distract the viewer from the film. Typically, unrealistic situations are welcome in a film, but for a film we're supposed to take seriously, it's very inexcusable.<br/><br/>Despite some inane moments and a weak plot, ""Salt"" is a pretty decent film. Sure it's paint- by-numbers and the film is bloated with action, but the break-neck pace and performances make it enjoyable. Now viewer beware, this film is no ""Inception"". ""Inception"" and ""Salt"" are in two different ballparks. ""Inception"" is a very complex film that you need your brain cap on in order to view the film. ""Salt"" is a very simple film where you need to turn your brain off in order to view the film. Overall, ""Salt"", while not highly comes mildly recommended."

"filipemanuelneto","6","0","0","23 May 2020"," Interesting, fast and intense, there is no time to think.
","It is not the first time that Angelina Jolie has brought a spy to life, she did it very well in ""Mr. And Mrs. Smith"". Here, she comes back and in good shape, with a good job, but she is no longer as young or as beautiful as she was.<br/><br/>The script is simple but intriguing: Evelyn Salt, a highly respected CIA agent, is accused by a Russian defector of being a Russian undercover agent, trained from a child to be a convincing American citizen until it's time to act. While trying to protect her husband from the actions of his agency colleagues, Salt will have to flee in order to try to clear her name and discover the truth. It is a good script and it develops very well, but very much within what we can expect in a spy movie. In fact, we've seen similar movies before.<br/><br/>The cast is, as I mentioned, led by Angelina Jolie. She is an actress who is no longer young, and may even seem old for her role here. But she is very good at what she does, she has charisma and presence. Anyway, I think this film will never be part of the top ten in her career, she seems very uninspired. The rest of the cast do what they have to do to support her: Liev Schreiber was very good and tried to surprise; Chiwetel Ejiofor has little to do besides being a counterpoint to Schreiber's character; Daniel Olbrychski had no material for more.<br/><br/>Technically, the film is good. What I highlight most is the fast pace, which helps to keep our interest. Everything happens very quickly. Without that, and the excellent action scenes throughout the film, our interest would certainly be lost before the middle. The pace also helps to mitigate the credibility flaws in the story, as we are so attentive to everything that happens that we do not question the logic of it. A smart move. To add, we have good cinematography, with very well filming work and some light tension that helps in the action and makes the film fun to watch without making it too intense.<br/><br/>Fun, fast-paced, action-packed and with an intriguing story behind it, it is a film that will make the audience stick to the screen until the end, although they may probably not want to repeat the shot after realizing the several flaws it has."

","The story and twist are interesting. The casting is perfect. Great performances by Angelina Jolie as Evelyn Salt, iev Schreiber as Theodore Ted Winter, and Chiwetel Ejiofor as Peabody. The scene where Salt killed Winter is my favorite.<br/><br/>Debatable holes:
1) Peabody and others should have been able to shoot Salt when they surrounded her before she jumped onto a truck.
2) Salt got into a hotel with guns. Did the hotel not have metal detectors?
3) How could Salt know the exact timing and location of the Russian president's speech? How could she know the underground way to the church?
4) The security around the church was weak, although they were American and Russian presidents.
5) How could nobody not see Salt when she got out of the police car?
6) The other Russian agents did not hear Salt killed her boss.
7) The other Russian agents were too easily killed and defeated by Salt.
8) How could they not detect the bomb brought in by Shnaider?
7) Salt very easily defeated all people who were protecting the US President. The security system was weak and easily breached.
8) How could the helicopters not able to find Salt after she jumped out of the helicopter? She could not hold her breath, stay underwater, and swim to the shore for that long. They could have just waited."

","I'm not a big fan of Angelina. I was never convinced of her ability to be Lara Croft. I was supremely impressed by her antics as Jane Smith in Mr. and Mrs. Smith. However, when it came to Wanted, she dropped back a level at the idiocy of the movie's ability to follow the rules of physics on top of the terrible performance and unexciting action sequences.<br/><br/>That's not the case here with Salt. It starts off with a quick introduction that kind of throws you off right away with Evelyn. As the movie comes back to present time and introduces Orlov and he accuses Salt, we now have a roller coaster approaching the first drop.<br/><br/>Jolie is impressive in each stunt she performs and the action, once started, doesn't let up. It grows more and more intense and proves more incredible with each following stunt. I compare some of the action in this to The Bourne Identity. However, Bourne's action is outdated and Matt Damon's stunts were never as exciting as Jolie's.<br/><br/>Aside from action, the story itself is beyond gripping. It plants you in your seat and glues your eyes to the screen, hanging on every piece of dialogue, you're mesmerized. I was thoroughly fascinated by every story twist that was thrown my way. I was still not ready for what would come next plot-wise even at the end of the film.<br/><br/>Although, me telling you that there is a twist, you will not find it as you search for it. It comes from nowhere and surprises you. It's breathtaking and it makes the film that much better. As you walk out of the theater, you will discuss with your friends or whoever, your favourite scenes and how awesome the plot twist is.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed Salt and while it is a great film, it's not the best of the year. I gave it a nine and I stand by it. I am not saying Inception, with a ten out of ten, is a perfect film -because no film is perfect- but Inception is the best film this year, thus far. Salt is the second best film this year. It's definitely a film, I will see more than once."

I say this is a flick worth checking out."

Not only is her acting terrible, but she's completely unbelievable as someone who can kill men twice her size and weight. She should have gone to the gym to make it believable, but then they would have had to cover her nasty tattoos with makeup to show her toned body. I'm glad they didnt do that. Liev Schreiber is also in it. Usually a good actor but here, like the rest of the cast, he just cant deliver here. <br/><br/>This bloodless PG13 thriller has a completely ridicoulus plot and some twist at the end. The action itself is boring.

","This is what ""Salt"" is all about really. It is essentially Jason Bourne who was transformed into a Russian female. The same super-human double-agent story! The same relentless slam-bang action scenes! The same set-up for a sequel or two! <br/><br/>Although the death-defying action scenes in ""Salt"" comes across as more difficult to swallow, somehow Angelina Jolie makes it all so believable despite her lean frame. It is really to Ms. Jolie's credit that she is the only credible female action star nowadays. It picks up where she left off in the Lara Croft films, ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" and more recently, ""Wanted."" She is tough and kick-ass, yet maintaining her cool, collected and sexy aura about her.<br/><br/>The intricate plot which is woven around Evelyn Salt, her shadowy origins and her present predicament as she was accused of plotting to kill the Russian president. Like the Bourne films, it is one big chase scene after the other, and many people being killed like flies, while our heroine comes out generally unscathed. Don't think too much and over-analyze the preposterous storyline. Just take it for what it is and enjoy the ride. Incredible yes, but it was very entertaining for me.<br/><br/>Good thing, Tom Cruise did not push through with this project, so they turned the lead character into a female and got Angelina Jolie to play her.

","Hmm, well as far as sleeper movies go, this one was pretty good. At first I thought Salt was innocent, and in a way she was. She did manage to regain most of her memory to collect enough to know she was a sleeper agent for the Russian government. But in her life, things get twisted in one way or the other. I thought the president was a sleeper himself but in fact it was Salt's ex boss who was. Quite a thought provoking film about old experiments that are still potent today than it was in the cold war. I like the action and the gun play, it could have used a bit more blood and guts in this espionage thriller but maybe some agents are a little polite. What was a bit of a throw off, is her character not being able to carry out any of her assignments since that is what she was trained for. Instead her own tactics were to kill everyone involved because of the death of her parents under the tutelage of Orlov her teacher and mentor. Basically she wanted pure revenge and nothing else. Her character played it brilliantly. To fool her superiors into thinking the Russian president is dead, and to go on to save the united states from the real evil agent. Good action, good actors, and very good story. Though I cannot give this ten stars, for the simple reason that this has a large hint of the Manchurian Candidate.

"ambrosia_1","7","4","13","25 July 2010"," If you read only one review...
","Let's keep this simple (because the writers sure didn't)...<br/><br/>Anyone that rates this movie a 1 or 2 just can't be pleased. If they rate it a 9 or 10, they are WAY too easy to please.<br/><br/>Salt is a John LeCarre style spy thriller, with a fairly implausible premise, and a couple of plot twists that you eventually have to relax and just ""go with"", or else allow them to spoil an otherwise decent picture.<br/><br/>Without giving anything away, Salt is an American CIA agent. One of the best. A Russian agent wishing to defect to America is brought into the CIA where he is debriefed by Salt (an expert on Russian spies), where he reveals that someone at the CIA named ""Evelin Salt"" is actually a Russian spy. This is a big deal for Salt for reasons that are made clear in the movies' opening sequence. Soon Salt finds herself on the run from the CIA while the audience (at least those not paying attention) are left to wonder, ""Is she a spy or isn't she?"" If you pay attention, you'll know the answer right away, and the movie becomes purely an action flick. If you are easily fooled or otherwise aren't paying attention, you may find yourself guessing almost up until the end (but if you haven't figured it out halfway thru the film, you're probably too dumb to have found the theater in the first place.) It's not Shakespeare, but it's not Plan 9 either. The film feels like one long action sequence that holds your attention till the end (which comes quickly, trimming the film to barely more than 90 minutes because of its frantic pace).<br/><br/>Jolie has the dramatic thing down pat in her career, but has been searching for a good action franchise for years (most notably the disappointing Tomb Raider series) without much success. Salt has the potential of turning into a decent female James Bond-esq franchise for Jolie, if they can just move past the sloppy plot formulation.<br/><br/>Bottom-line, if you see it, you won't come away feeling you wasted $9. If you can handle a decent action movie containing a number of weak plot-twists without groaning, you'll come away pleased. In all, a 6.5 is about right ratings-wise. Good, not great. Better than average despite weak writing."

Well, how about this...here's a movie you can watch again because it's a good story. Nothing more. Nothing less.<br/><br/>Angelina Jolie plays Evelyn Salt, a C.I.A spy. Her life is turned upside down when a former Cold War warrior, Vassily Orlov (played by Daniel Olbrychski) comes into her workplace seeking to defect in return for passing on information useful to the C.I.A. Orlov asserts that Salt is a 'sleeper agent'...someone working for the Russians and who will do their bidding...which will involve dire consequences for America.<br/><br/>Salt does her cause great harm by running away, but not before letting her C.I.A. peers know that she is being set up. Orlov had asserted that their sleeper agent - Salt - was to assassinate the Russian President when he attended the funeral of the American Vice-President in America. The question becomes ""Is Salt going to try and prevent the assassination of the Russian president or carry it out like Orlov says she will?"".<br/><br/>Almost an hour into the movie I was onto what the real state of affairs was and had formed some hypotheses about the characters and their motives. Which is to say that it was good that the movie kept me guessing for so long about what was going on.<br/><br/>The action sequences in this movie are well handled. Cf the incoherent method used in the last James Bond movie ""Quantum of solace"". In fact, this movie comes across as being to Jolie what ""Casino Royale"" was to Daniel Craig...an entertaining spy movie.

If the film wasn't based on a graphic novel, it will probably spur on a couple of others.<br/><br/>I could go on about the plot more, but it's really a kind of plot that needs to be just taken in as it goes. That the film becomes almost non-stop action after Salt is ""outed"" as a Russian spy is part of this as well. We're mostly watching what comes of another Russian spy coming in and claiming she really works as part of an 'Something-X' program, the likes of which were made to assassinate JFK (conspiracy action, very fun montage). The fun then, and really what makes it more fun that it should be illegitimately, is the actors believing so much in what they do. Jolie is part of it, looking glamorous like a movie star and also can kick ass when she has to - which is a lot - and Liev Schrieber and Chiwetel Ejofor get some decent supporting roles to play with. And of course twists keep coming, and second-guessing being the name of the game in spy movies helps keep one interested.<br/><br/>I was never bored through Salt, and that is really the biggest compliment I would want to pay it. It could have been directed with a level of professionalism and courtesy for the viewer's intelligence, but still also not very interesting. The careening-around plot, Jolie's screen presence and hints at deeper meaning, make it something a little more than it could have been. And by the end, we're hoping that there will be another Salt movie, perhaps with an even stronger plot. It's not a triumph, but a tightly constructed summer spy movie following long after the coat-tails of Bourne."

","This film has about as much action as can be crammed into a 90-minute movie. Of course, everything in the film is basically unbelievable: such as Angelina Jolie being bulletproof, scaling walls like Spider Man, plus a whole lot of surprising resurrections--so why should anything else be believable? Angelina and Liev Schreiber (who plays her colleague) are gifted enough to get the audience through several plot twists.<br/><br/>I was never bored, and there was some considerable suspense which built up near the end. I think the film can definitely be enjoyed if not too much thought is given to the motivations of certain characters. And the body count by the end of the film."

","Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie) is just your ordinary, run-of-the-mill CIA agent until a supposed Russian defector (Daniel Olbrychski) lets slip that she is a Russian spy during an interrogation. Salt is forced to go on the run, carrying out a series of increasingly dangerous actions that occasionally make sense. While being pursued by both her former colleagues and a sleeper cell of Russian terrorists, she keeps everyone (including the audience) asking the same question: just what side is Evelyn Salt on? <br/><br/>It's possible that ""Salt"" may have the widest range of reviews of any movie from 2010. Comments from writers I greatly respect would have had me believing that this was either one of the better action movies of the year or one of the more convoluted, pointless films of the year. I'm afraid I come closer to the latter camp than the former. Clearly the point of the movie is to keep the audience guessing so that the final twist is especially earth shattering. Unfortunately, I had completely lost interest in the movie's plot by the time we get to the final reveal or whether or not Salt is a hero or a villain. I'm all for a film that challenges me to follow along (see: ""Inception"") but I have a tendency to shut down when I feel like a movie is screwing with my mind just for the heck of it. Maybe that's an indictment of me as much as it is ""Salt"" but regardless, the various twists and turns just left me feeling cold and uncaring as to what would happen. In addition, the action sequences are quite outlandish and while that might work for a Jerry Bruckheimer production, it doesn't seem to fit here. Moreover, I just don't buy Jolie as an action star. I've tried, I really have, but she just doesn't work for me in these types of roles. Add that all together with an under-utilization of one great character actor (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and the typecasting of another (Liev Schreiber) and the result is thoroughly unimpressive.<br/><br/>Check out my site: www.thesoapboxoffice.blogspot.com"

","Alright one reader I am out of retirement. So what movie is so powerful it could drive me out of my golden critical slumber it is ""salt"". So salt is not critically acclaimed, it is not a classic in the making, and it is not an indy, what it is is a movie that sucks. I mean really sucks. Its premise, about a sleeper cell of Russian agents hell bent on bringing down America would have flown 25 years ago, but not now. The action sequences were laughable. I mean fine we are almost always supposed to believe people can do things in these movies that would kill other people but come on this Russian bitch jumped from truck to truck on a highway like it was nothing after jumping onto a truck from an overpass. One of the things I will always love about ""diehard"" is that by the end Bruce Willis was so badly bruised, bloody, and beaten it was plausible that this man went through what he did. The fact that Angelina Jolie still had perfect makeup after this ordeal tells me one thing, people don't pay to see an ugly Angelina Jolie just ask the people who made ""a mighty heart"", which by the way did not suck, this did stay away unless you don't mind a horrible plot, laughable heroics, and plot twists that leave you saying ""i saw that coming""!! if you like concise reviews of interesting flicks read my blog at http://raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com/"

","While both my wife and I eagerly look forward to every Jolie movie, and we both thoroughly enjoyed Salt, I couldn't help feeling that we needed some Tequila and Lime as well.<br/><br/>It's not a bad movie as such. It's got a lot going for it, great acting, amazing action scenes, and as usual, Jolie pulls off sexy badass just by existing. But the story was a strange sort of blend between the Manchurian Candidate and Invasion of the Body Snatchers. The Russians apparently, back during the cold war, placed a number of specially trained children into American life as sleeper agents that would one day rise up, seize control of the American Nuclear Arsenal and... nuke it? Spark a war? I'm a little fuzzy about what the Endgame is really supposed to be, but apparently so is Evelyn Salt, since after her cover is blown and she is brought into the fold with her sleeper agent counterparts, they kill her none-the-wiser husband and she goes ballistic. Using her skills, she goes rogue and infiltrates her own infiltration program in order to kill everyone involved with it. She even jumps out of a helicopter at the end.<br/><br/>Again, despite the odd, cliché' ridden plot and the stretched believability of Russians starting anything more than an impolite dinner conversation these days, Salt is a fun movie.<br/><br/>As always, Jolie makes the character real. I heard the movie and the part was originally written for a male character, but they changed it to cast Jolie in the role. Probably because while straight women would have been drawn to a male lead, they needed Jolie to bring in the straight women AND the action-movie male crowd.<br/><br/>I would place this movie on the level of a Die Hard sequel. While the action is great, the tension is real, and the acting is perfect, the movie does have its flaws. It's still an enjoyable ride and if you're a fan of the Jolie-appeal, you should definitely check it out.<br/><br/>(P.S. When will bad guys learn not to kill helpless spouses?

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","6","2","5","5 February 2011"," A preposterous spy thriller, but a reasonably entertaining one
","Ever since 2002, Hollywood has had a case of mistaken ""Bourne Identity,"" pulling the trigger on any script that weaves government Intelligence with guns and combat and centers on a protagonist who doesn't know his or her own strength. ""Salt"" is another byproduct of the ""Bourne"" era, yet barely executes half as well as that consummate secret agent thriller.<br/><br/>Angeline Jolie plays the titular ""hero"" in question, a CIA agent. When she interrogates a Russian who claims a Soviet sleeper agent will attempt to assassinate the president of Russia, she finds the finger pointed at her as that exact agent and so she goes on the run, very quickly putting her innocence out of the question, whereas the film would lead you to believe it's a ""is she or isn't she?"" movie. Whenever that's the case, you can bet the answer lies in the gray area, but nevertheless, that's ""Salt.""<br/><br/>Why movie scripts can't simply let go of old Cold War themes and plots warrants a rigorous head scratch. Writer Kurt Wimmer (""Law Abiding Citizen,"" ""Equilibrium"") has a history of penning films that are never as believable as they are entertaining and ""Salt"" follows suit. The idea of bitter ""comrades"" awakening sleeper agents 20 years later that they trained and planted in the USA in hopes of reigniting nuclear war might top his list of improbable.<br/><br/>Yet ""Salt"" has a nuclear warhead in Angelina Jolie, Hollywood's most treasured femme fatale. When Tom Cruise left the project, she became the sexy choice and consequently might have saved a Cruise-led ""Salt"" from complete annihilation critically and financially.<br/><br/>Philip Noyce (""Patriot Games,"" ""Clear and Present Danger"") could direct a film like this in his sleep and he may well have. I was able to watch the director's cut, which is insignificant when you don't see the theatrical cut, but I didn't find anything other than the action all that redeeming, so I imagine it made no difference. His expertise lies in flipping the adrenaline switch on and satisfying that part of every viewer that's just waiting for the action to kick into gear. It's very obvious when something will happen, but the results are less predictable than you'd expect.<br/><br/>The real problem with ""Salt,"" preposterousness aside, comes in story structure. In order for the effective twists and turns at the end (not unforeseeable, but still exciting), Wimmer and Noyce both have to downplay Salt's character. Frankly, she sucks for most of the film. She's a terrible protagonist because -- without giving anything away -- the script's not-so-well guarded secrets are held in priority above her character development. Irrelevant flashbacks to her ""husband"" are an attempt at humanizing her, but her present actions become too strong for those sympathy cards to work.<br/><br/>Espionage thriller and action movie fans will find comfort in ""Salt"" and continue to be drawn to Jolie's performances in these roles, but those who can't keep their fingers out of plot holes and have to ponder the feasibility of a story will be frustrated throughout most. For me, the twists at the end sorting the film out and making it ""matter"" more saved it from total mediocrity.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com"

"AZINDN","3","2","5","4 January 2011"," Salt but no pepper
","This is a silly film. Unbelievable and fantasy yet set in contemporary DC in the post-cold war present. However, for the sake of a shallow storyline, audiences are introduced to Evelyn Salt, a CIA agent who leads several agents through the streets of the metropolitan capital in search of her husband, a dedicated spider-specialist at the Smithsonian. After she is accused by a Russian defector of being a sleeper spy, Salt runs, leaps, and bounds over cars, people, trucks, and subway turnstiles to avoid capture by CIA spy guys who quickly turn on her in the the name national security. Why all these men are so easily turned against the beautiful agent who was so valuable the CIA traded for her release from North Korean capture is never rationalized. Nor, why no one ever bothers to check references by those who quickly rush to judgment over the accusations of the evil ""defector"". Nothing in this film bothers to have much credibility, it is simply a vehicle to showcase Ms. Jolie's ability to run and jump without fear of gravity and down shots of vodka with her Russian spy brothers.<br/><br/>Believable is Liev Schriber as Salt's colleague/supervisor who keeps the hounds of investigation at bay, yet seems to have cornered the market on playing duplicitous government plants and credible agents. Ms. Jolie, beautiful yet too skinny to be a roustabout, is miscast in a film that tries to lead toward a future sequel yet is sorely lacking the basic structure of a taut compelling storyline such as the Jason Bourne films. Simply a chase and run film for the sake of car crashes and closeups of Jolie's stunning looks, this endeavor wastes time and money."

","You know, I know that the movie makers here know that the Russians are no longer enemies. So when they try to make them the bad guys these days it rubs me the wrong way. It's just unrealistic.<br/><br/>And that's not the only unrealistic thing in this movie. The violations of physics (as Ebert says) finally got to me to be too much. Jumping from a semi-truck on one overpass down to another on the lower level and coming out with no injuries jars me when I watch it. This is not Spiderman here, it's supposed to be ""real"". But it's not. It's just unrealistic.<br/><br/>Nevermind the fact that there hasn't been a funeral for a American VP since, well, since a long time, I can live with the invented history. But to have an attempt on the Russian president without an historical background is too much for me. It's just unrealistic.<br/><br/>And having the main character being what she is, as we soon find out, is also just unrealistic. A mole in the CIA? For sure. But not like this. I expect a mole these days to either do it for the money or for Islam. This is neither. It's just unrealistic.<br/><br/>And the romance between Salt and her husband? No spark. Maybe I'm trying to compare it to Mr. and Mrs. Smith, where the romance had wonderful spark - no wonder, as they were probably not acting there. But still I expect to like the couple, and frankly, I was indifferent. It's just unrealistic.<br/><br/>And after being chased and injured (or not?), Salt is finally in custody in a helicopter above the Potomac in the winter. She jumps out, and lands in the water. No injury, no hypothermia. Quickly swims to shore and runs - soaking wet - did I mention she's dressed like it's June outside? I'm sorry, when I saw that, I just lost it. It's just unrealistic.<br/><br/>I can go on and on.<br/><br/>I know, I know, it's just a movie.<br/><br/>But I want to buy into the movie, I want to emotionally invest in the characters.

","Salt's basic and predictable plot really undermines the film's potential to do more with its lead role, Angelina Jolie. Though the star gave it all she got playing a Russian spy, she wasn't enough to save the film from its wrong pacing style and ridiculously bad plot. Being trained as a Russian spy since she was a little girl, Evenlyn Salt lived a secret second life all this time. She's married and has a dog. But she worked in the CIA, so I guess that's something. Given that Angelina Jolie played the role, we have high expectations that she'd pull it off with lots of dramatic scenes. And that's exactly what we got. From the moment that she was being tortured in North Korea to the moment when she killed her spy partner, she was great. But given the fact that every spy movies starts with an undercover life and being captured at the end, Salt adds nothing new to the genre."

","I really did. Salt's heroine is interesting, complicated and for want of a better word ""awesome"". The storyline in hind sight is pre-posterous, but whilst watching, you're swept up in the interweaving sex appeal of the two leads, the meandering storyline and the high octane action sequences.<br/><br/>Jolie as always is a solid and deep seeded lead, and with the support of Liev Schreiber who plays to his ""tough hiding a secret guy"" keep the film from falling where lesser actors may have let it. Giving Jolie the lead over a man was the right idea, she makes an hero that Bruce Willis and Tom Cruise wouldn't have been able to make. Vulnerable, but deadly and secretive may have been a stretch for there overtly masculine persona's. The direction is nothing you haven't seen before in the Bourne trilogy or other slick spy flicks, but the pace is relentless and won't ever have you yawning at any point.<br/><br/>It may well be popcorn fodder for most and there may be some kind of misinterpretions of certain countries, but it is a work of fiction, forgetting reality and getting into the story will help with enjoyment of this film.<br/><br/>By no means the perfect action caper, however one of the best I've seen since The Dark Knight. Jolie is fantastic and I hope the franchise grows in popularity as it is ""The Best"" female action vehicle I've seen."

As for the plot, similar stories have been around for a long time. Yet, it's always interesting to get that extra surprise and twist at the end of the movie. A sequel is definitely possible...

"thomvic","8","2","5","27 September 2010"," Suspenseful, slick, daring....Salt delivers the punches
","OK I thought this was simply going to be one of those - 'I've been framed' movies and discovering who is behind this whole set up thing. This is what turned me off from seeing it in the first place, but I was still intrigued, so saw it with a group of friends after celebrating my birthday.<br/><br/>What a surprise! This was not only interesting but suspenseful all the way through. The action scenes have been criticised, saying they aren't realistic - for people comparing this to James Bond, come on - you think those scenes are realistic (aka: Die Another Day title wave scene?). This was well directed and I thought the soundtrack added a lot of the tension. In comparison with the Bourne films, well I don't think you can compare it on all levels because essentially they have different plot lines, different motivations and also Bourne is more about discovering who he is. In Salt, Salt knows who she is, but it is up to the audience to find out.<br/><br/>What I think we miss nowadays are strong female leads in action roles in which the film has a serious tone, so it is a welcome refresher to see Angelina kick some butt. I mean we already had Matt Damon in the Bourne films, so I thought it was about time we had a woman. It was a wise choice to change the lead role (in which it was originally meant to be a guy with Tom Cruise, thank god it was changed since he probably would have made this really boring!) to a female as it gave it more depth and an added twist.<br/><br/>The plot in short: Angelina plays Evelyn Salt, who works for the CIA, then is accused by a Russian defector of being an inside Russian Spy undercover in the US. Of course, Salt doesn't stand for it and ends up on the run, with us wondering exactly who she is.<br/><br/>Yeah OK it's not the most original plot line (but what is nowadays) but the way it is handled is terrific, the action scenes are done fast enough to not make you notice the slight flaws and absurdity (which I think adds a lot to it anyway) of it. The truck trailer scene I thought was done spectacularly. <br/><br/>Much has been said about the fact that Salt jumps from one truck to another then is able to run at fast speed again - well yeah I can see they sort of made her superwoman but I guess I didn't really notice it too much when I first watched it.<br/><br/>I think they should have had a bit more quiet moments throughout the pacing; it pretty much jumps from one action scene to another, with a few flashbacks into her past, though more could have been done with character development. If Jolie weren't to star in this, I don't know which other Hollywood actress could pull this character off and have the same screen appeal to keep the audience rooting for her. <br/><br/>There is one thing I am a bit tired of - why keep making Russians the villains? It seems America will never get over this love/hate relationship with them, so for all those Russians out there who watch this movie, well you are forgiven for criticising this movie, and are probably blaming Hollywood for Americans stereotyping them so much.<br/><br/>Angelina never looked better as a black haired action heroine, and she definitely delivers. It is definitely a roller coaster ride that kept me intrigued from start to finish. The ending is a bit abrupt and was done for the purpose of a sequel but if the sequel dwelves more into her character, I'm sure it will deliver."
"BlyndeFaith","Null","2","5","26 September 2010"," Connecting the dots
","CONTAINS SPOILERS!<br/><br/>A number of those who saw Salt had some questions about the movie. Here's my attempt at connecting (some of) the dots:<br/><br/>Evelyn Salt is a CIA agent, but she's also a sleeper agent for the Russians. The problem for her Russian spymaster, Orlov, is that she's married - which is against the rules - and so her allegiance is suspect.<br/><br/>Here are some questions and answers.<br/><br/>Who is Salt? She is a CIA agent. Although she started as a Russian sleeper agent, her allegiance is now with the USA, after her detention by N. Korea and her subsequent release made possible by an expert arachnologist whom she marries.<br/><br/>Why is she exposed by Orlov? 1. Orlov wants the CIA to believe that Russia is behind the assassination plot to kill the Russian president in order to stoke US- Russia tensions and escalate the strain to a nuclear conflict. 2. Orlov wants to activate Salt from her sleeper status and carry out the assassination (which is also a test of Salt's allegiance). 3. Orlov wants to divert the CIA's attention to Salt so that the real plot (nuclear bombing of Arab nations by the US) can be carried out by another sleeper agent (Winter). 4. Implicating Salt will make her the fall guy after the real mission is carried out by the sleeper agent.<br/><br/>Why does Salt run from the CIA when Orlov escapes CIA custody? Salt runs from the CIA because she knows her husband is in danger, since she her marriage is against the ""rules"" imposed on sleeper agents. If she can't find her husband, she figures her husband is held hostage by her Russian spymaster, but will be released after her mission is carried out.<br/><br/>Why does Salt carry out her mission to kill the Russian president? Salt carries out her mission to ""prove"" that she is still loyal to her Russian spymaster, and hence secure the release of her husband. Although it initially appears that the Russian president is assassinated, Salt does not actually kill him - he is merely put into a state of temporary paralysis when Salt injects him with spider venom (not seen on screen, but implied near the end of the film).<br/><br/>Why does Salt follow the presidential team to the bunker? To stop the president from launching the nuclear weapons. It's not clear at that point if Salt knows there is another sleeper agent (Winter) besides the NATO mole (Shnaider) who blew himself up. Presumably, Salt knows the NATO mole's self-sacrifice isn't the objective, which is to secure American missiles for the ""Day X"" mission. <br/><br/>What evidence is there to show Salt's allegiance to the US? 1. No American is killed by Salt 2. The Russian president is not killed by Salt, but merely put in a state of temporary paralysis. This requires premeditation on Salt's part, and not an afterthought. 3. She doesn't shoot agent Peabody even though she has the drop on him. 4. She kills all the Russians on the barge (though this is also an act of revenge for the killing of her husband) 5. She stops the nuclear missiles from being launched"

","Firstly this film is being rated as an action film as it was intended to be. Yes an ACTION film. It does not contain the answers to life, oddly!<br/><br/>Salt has style. Angelina Jolie + Phillip Noyce (director of ""Dead Calm"")= a entertaining night out. Was it original? Well more so than ""the Departed"" (actually a remake of infernal affairs and yet look at the praise for originality). Was it predictable? Yes. So to ,however, was ""Shutter Island"" and yet look at some of the comments made in reference to the plot, particularly the ending;still an OK movie by the way. Did it contain stereotypes? Of course it did ,it's about a Russian spy! vs the world ,which was made evident by the trailer/marketing campaign. Did I mention it's an action film starring Angelina Jolie, ""Who is Salt"" etc. Was the plot believable? Anybody seen the news of late, (i.e the x amount of Russian sleeper spy's deported back to Russia, whom have been living undetected in the USA since the cold war. Many of which had/have husbands, wives, children and jobs etc.)and no this wasn't part of Sony's marketing campaign. So the general idea absolutely. One person taking out numerous armed assailants? Have I mentioned it's an action movie starring Angelina Jolie. Basically it did the job of propelling the film forward towards it's climax, kept good pace and gave us just enough back story to relate to its main protagonist (i.e Salt). The action was well shot, not ""jerky"" or to ""zoomed in"" as many have mentioned (please see an optometrist, seriously!). Consistently paced with good stunt work and satisfactory performances.<br/><br/>If you like films such as the ""Bond"" ,""bourne"" and ""Die Hard"" franchises then you will surely enjoy ""Salt"". I genuinely believe the fact that it has a female lead has lead to a lot of negative reviews.Get over it people.Girls can kick-ass too.<br/><br/>This is my first review and having been a fan of IMDb for a few years now and wincing every time I read some absurd rant about a film. For example ""Fern Gully "" sorry I mean ""Avatar""( what follows is an actual quote, I kid you not!) "" Not since ""Schindler's list"" have I been so moved by a film"". UNOBTAINIUM, hello! I thought is was about time I opened my mouth, figuratively speaking of course."

","I shall keep this as brief as possible. The support cast do an OK job, i am a fan of Liev Schreiber, always underrated. There is a defining role for him out there, somewhere. I am not a huge Jolie fan, not since seeing tomb raider: cradle of life. (enough said about that abomination). Firstly i just don't buy into Jolie in this movie, she is way to skinny (feed her brad!!) to be a super agent, every time she takes a death defying leap I'm afraid she going to snap in two. The plot is fine, its only problem is it lacks a genuinely strong and believable actor to drive it along. Also the dialogue is dire, in the very last scene the conversation is laughable really. All i want with my movies is as little loving care and attention applied to the script. It should be a fundamental building block of any movie despite the genre. All in all this is a forgettable movie, the occasional big set piece, but absolutely no where near the class of Bourne Ultimatum. My advice is stay home and watch the Bourne trilogy."

","It is very doubtful you could catch a catnap during this action-thriller when filmmakers like Peter Berg, Brian Helgeland, Phillip Noyce and Kurt Wimmer get together. Evelyn Salt(Angelina Jolie), a dedicated CIA agent, is accused by a defector of being a Russian sleeper spy. Salt tries to convince her mentor and supervisor Winter(Liev Schreiber)of her innocence. Circumstances force Salt to go rouge, using every tactic and disguise in her training, to stay ahead of her pursuers in order to prove her loyalty and protect her newlywed German husband. The longer she eludes ambitious CIA agent Peabody(Chiwetel Ejiofor); the more suspicion is placed on her real motives. The action is hard, swift and pulse-pounding. Don't be so certain you can predict the story's end. Jolie is not just beautiful...she is volatile.

","The problem with Angalina Jolie action films is that generally they she is better than the script and so the story goes again. 'Salt' tries to follow the Bourne route but without the charm or skill that the Bourne films had. Every scene is telegraphed and predicable with little to no suspense beyond the first 20 minutes. The story also comes over as completely daft which doesn't help.<br/><br/>The acting is pretty standard, though I for some reason spent most of the film thinking 'doesn't Angalina look gaunt' which was a bit of a put off. Few of the other actors are given much to bite into, though Liev Schreiber does a good job playing her boss. The action scenes vary in quality with the occasional good idea. Generally though there is nothing that hasn't been done before or better in other films.<br/><br/>I can't say I was much of a fan of the directing of cinematography. The camera work had the standard jerkiness that I have grown to hate over the years in action films and the editing doesn't really help. The music fits in OK and isn't particularly noticeable which is good and the set design is done well.<br/><br/>Over all the film is a let down. Jolie is a good actress but not even she can save this very average film. Even though I have been very negative with this review, I didn't hate the film but I did feel that it could have been much much better. This film clings to a 6 out of 10 by its fingernails and probably should be a 5."

So, yes, she would not budge most of her opponent, let alone bring them down. And all of those CIA/FBI/SecretService dudes are bad shots and can not get a heli within 10min.

The script was weak and the setup for the sequel seemed forced and contrived.<br/><br/>Leiv Schreiber was good, as he always seems to be. There is something very watchable about this guy and hopefully his next flick will give him something more meaty to play with. Chiwetel Ejiofor was also quite good, but his lines and general part in the overall story were very poor and he seemed to be in there for just the setup for the sequel.<br/><br/>Angelina Jolie was very poor in this movie. Perhaps because of the one dimensional, unlikeable and unbelievable character she had to play. The action scenes were particularly bad, as it was easy to tell none of it was done by Jolie. This is something most movie makers seem to get right, but in this film it is blatantly obvious that the stunts are being performed by a man. The biggest disappointment with the action is that Salt seems to be able to perform the actions of a superhero, and yet the whole time we have to believe she is but a mortal human being. It disappoints me as Angelina Jolie is a great actress and she has impressed me in many movies.<br/><br/>This film is worth a look at, but not something you would choose to watch again and certainly has nothing about it to get you talking round the water-cooler.<br/><br/>Could have been great, ended up very average."
"jboothmillard","4","2","5","21 August 2010"," Salt
","I saw the trailer for this film and liked the look of it, from both the leading star and the fact that it looked cool, from director Phillip Noyce (The Bone Collector, Rabbit-Proof Fence, The Quiet American). Basically Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie) is a respected CIA agent, but that all changes when she is pulled into an interrogation with a Russian spy Vassily Orlov (Daniel Olbrychski) offering vital information. With lie detector technology they conclude that his information of the President of Russia being assassinated is true, but also he says that Evelyn is the assassin, this is also read to be true. Evelyn is now eager to escape claiming to be innocent, and she just about manages it going home to her husband, and then she immediately goes back to being on the run from the authorities. Her boss Ted Winter (Liev Schreiber) was originally sure that she was innocent, but he eventually agrees with agent Peabody (Love Actually's Chiwetel Ejiofor) that she should be hunted more severely. Eventually though it turns out that this assassination attempt on Russian President Matveyev (Home Alone 3's Olek Krupa) during the funeral of the U.S. Vice President by Evelyn is true. Through a series of flashbacks we see that she was trained since childhood to be a good Russian spy, and the next thing she does is to return to Orlov who made her what she is. I can't remember completely how it goes, but it turns out that Salt may indeed a good girl going against her Russian orders, and it is actually a double-crossing Winter that kidnaps the President of the United States to launch nuclear weapons. In the end, after saving the day, but being caught and looking like it was her launching the missiles she tries to convince Peabody of what happened, and he frustratingly lets her jump out the helicopter to go on the run again. Also starring Andre Braugher as Secretary of Defense and August Diehl as Mike Krause. Apparently Tom Cruise was lined up to be Salt, but I think it does work better with a female character, especially with one as gorgeous and reliable as Jolie. The story is really a weird combination, it starts like a cool Jason Bourne style chase fest (the best sequences), and then it changes to a Manchurian Candidate style assassin thing, if it could just stick to one style and not confuse so much as to whether Salt is a hero or villain, it might have been a slightly better action thriller, but it's not terrible. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Sound Mixing. Okay!"
"movie_buff37","9","4","14","24 July 2010"," Angelina Jolie + Russian Spies = Amazing Movie!
","I heard that Tom Cruise was originally suppose to be Salt in this movie and I am sure glad he wasn't. We don't need another Tom Cruise Mission Impossible like movie, the change in gender was a perfect move. Angelina as Salt is perfect! She is the only female that could have pulled this off. I also like the idea of a female action lead, as we don't see it that often.<br/><br/>Is it over the top? Yes. Is it somewhat unrealistic? Yes. But if you want FANTASTIC action scenes and crazy stunts- stunts that you have never seen before, you won't be disappointed. The plot is not too complicated but the number of twists and turns throughout will keep you satisfied.<br/><br/>It is fast-paced and fun. Definitely worth seeing, especially if you are looking for an action packed flick, or you are an Angelina fan. I really enjoyed it and I would definitely see it again when it comes out on video."
"socrates99","8","4","14","23 July 2010"," Nice performances all around but especially Angelina
","The first half of this film is particularly well shot and conceived, almost in the extreme. This director does what I enjoy the most and what some of the very best directors do, i.e. give you a visceral perspective on the very physical action. What's surprising is that Ms Jolie is up to delivering her part of the bargain because this is no Lara Croft excursion. It's far more suggestive of reality. Time and again women, and that goes double for beautiful women, have no real feel for violence. But Angelina definitely understands the role as conceived by Kurt Wimmer.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the film sags a bit in the second half and is more run of the mill there, though still very entertaining. Actually it's a good time to get a refill on that popcorn. But kudos to Angelina and the director especially, who do the genre proud. It's a fun time at the movies and Angelina is probably the first woman to successfully grab an action role from someone like Tom Cruise."
"dvc5159","6","3","10","29 July 2010"," James Bond, Jason Bourne and now... Evelyn Salt?
","Sorry, but I still prefer Charly Baltimore (Geena Davis) from ""The Long Kiss Goodnight"". She is still the ultimate kick-ass heroine for me, followed by Ellen Ripley from the ""Alien"" quadrilogy. But Angelina Jolie still can carry an action flick, and it certainly shows in this one. It's way better than her ""Tomb Raider"" movies.<br/><br/>From start to finish ""Salt"" is action-packed and leaves little to no time for dramatics. It's all about Jolie and the action. Briskly paced at 100 minutes and with perfect, fluid editing time flies by as you become entertained at what's happening at the screen, no matter how preposterous it is.<br/><br/>Preposterous? Why yes, there are some (note: SOME, not all) overdone moments, and some plot devices that are too far-fetched to be believed, but we're entertained too damn much that we never really notice. It's like the right movie to see after becoming mind-screwed by ""Inception"" (which isn't a bad thing); a Panadol for the brain.<br/><br/>Jolie is perfect for the role, showing cold emotion and ruthlessness in all her scenes, especially the action sequences. Kurt Wimmer who wrote the script did a nice job tailoring Jolie for the role. Liev Schrieber and especially Chiwetel Ejiofor are also great in the roles that they portray, with Ejiofor giving a tough performance which is the polar opposite of his worry-wart character in last year's ""2012"".<br/><br/>What I like about this movie is the constant guessing game the film presents to the audience. At times the film become too predictable, but at times it isn't. Kurt Wimmer weaves these in to his action-packed script that is filled with intrigue and danger, although I wish some of the twists were more original. The premise is nicely written and not overblown though, and that's a good thing.<br/><br/>Having said that, I must commend the filmmakers for getting this done (even Roger Ebert said it): bringing back the Russians as Hollywood's favorite villains. Ever since the cold war ended we've been bombarded with a variety of politically correct villains such as Arabs, North Koreans, South American crime lords etc. Russian villains has always been a favorite with Hollywood: just look at the early James Bond films and even ""Rambo: First Blood Part II"" and ""Rambo III"", mainly because of their dangerous nuclear capabilities, but in most of these films they're depicted in a cartoonish fashion. ""Salt"" not only brings the Russian villains back from the dead - it makes them believable.<br/><br/>Who else but Phillip Noyce can direct a film with such tension and fluidity with ease? I've been an admirer of Noyce ever since ""Clear and Present Danger"" and he is a great thriller director, and this film somewhat proves it, albeit a somewhat physically absurd one. Physically absurd because, as mentioned earlier, some of the action sequences are preposterous. But they're well-directed thanks to Noyce. The cinematography also frames the action well, with the cameraman NOT afflicted with Parkinson's (Is Hollywood returning to STEADYcam?) The music score by James Newton Howard suits the tension and rousing action of the movie perfectly, and the production design is classy,<br/><br/>In short, it's everything a popcorn action movie is. Don't have too high expectations and you'll be pleased. It's a fun ride from start to finish, and I recommend it for a fun time at the movies without too much overkill.<br/><br/>Entertainment value: 10/10<br/><br/>Overall: 7/10"

I'm more confused over these comments than I am the movie. the movie was NOT confusing, nor did it have these jerky camera angles. If it did, I definitely did not notice them.. However, the fight scenes were edited too much to make it look like there was an actual fight, but it didn't bother me one bit. these jerky camera angles? Well, I can't answer that b/c I didn't even notice it but apparently others did.. the movie had a lot of twists and turns but was not confusing and kept you guessing the whole time.. now finally, these people who say the movie is unrealistic??! that is the most mind numbing comment of them all - b/c what movie is realistic?? If this movie was realistic, how boring do you think it would be? Movies are made like this so you could use your imagination and enjoy a good movie experience. Obviously everyone compares this movie to the Bourne franchise which is probably just as unrealistic! but this movie, without a doubt kicked major butt and I was so blown away by Angelina Jolie's performance as an action character! there is in my opinion no other female who could've pulled this off. I was wondering how this movie would be before i saw it about having a female as the lead role and blew all my expectations out of the water, especially as myself being a man. We are used to always seeing men play these roles - well this changed everything! she was amazing in this role and i look forward to her making another one! I also probably like it a lot b/c Leiv Schrieber is perhaps my favorite actor or at least one of them.. I admit i am very easy to please in a movie but no movie since Dark Knight kept me talking about it for so long after seeing it. Usually i'll see a movie, talk about it that night or occasionally here and there.. I saw Salt last week and I've thought about this movie everyday since and keep checking IMDb ratings hoping it will improve. A current 6.8 is not bad but this movie deserves way higher! it had everything you want in an action movie - A good plot, excellent writing, excellent acting and great action scenes! this movie delivered and then some! Usually twists and turns are annoying and hard to follow but this movie made it enjoyable b/c you just didn't know what to expect. Kudos to Angelina for probably changing the face of film and opening the door to more female leads in action film. Tom Cruise was originally selected for this role but after seeing her do it, this movie was made for her!! I can't say enough good things about it.. But as I was saying, what surprises me most are these negative reviews! I mean, am I that blind to all these people saying such things as it being so confusing, jerky camera angles, etc??

","he Bourne Identity and Salt need to team up and have lunch when not on the run. They really have a connection and are in a similar movie just replaced genders. Salt is one of the better thrillers of 2010 and is not a movie that goes ape with twists and turns. It has a couple here and there but really its just a typical thriller. Its a movie that has fun with itself and thats something I look for in movies like this. A movie that can enjoy itself which can get dialogue when needed and give decent action sequences.<br/><br/>Angelina Jolie has never been an actress I followed with passion. If something came out that had an interest level that was higher than expected with her, Id see it. But in retrospect I haven't seen more than three things with her name on it. Salt is one Im glad I did check out because I was debating Inception beforehand. Ill see it at one point, but I was looking for some slim and slender Jolie to satisfy. Rather blonde, black haired, or with a tomboyish cut, shes attractive.<br/><br/>The plot involves Evelyn Salt (Jolie) a CIA agent who is recently uncovered by Orlov who reveals the plans of Russians who want to bring all hell to the United States. When Salt is said to be involved a brainscan is conducted on the man and hes telling the truth. The agent co-workers go on a spree looking for her and want to catch her as soon as possible. The action begins as we see Salt jump out of windows jump out of moving cars, run through traffic, tase cops, and so on. The action gets redundant, but after the CIA jargon scenes you want some mind numbing scenes.<br/><br/>Salt has it's share of flaws. To begin with, like James Bond and the Bourne series the film has a lot of punching, slapping, and hitting in it. Which is fine, but almost no blood is seen, at least not that I noticed. Now, I don't want one punch to make the face explode in gore, but some blood dripping from cuts would be realistic enough. Im sick of watching action movies that that don't involve blood. We are supposed to believe a kick to the face leaves no blood? Also, its a shame that this film got cut to a PG-13 rating. If we got an R rating we could have perhaps seen blood, maybe some cutting, a sex scene or two? But for some reason, this had to be cut to a PG-13 rating. Honestly, I don't understand toning a movie down. Most notably Prom Night for being a PG-13 slasher film. Thats no excuse, no reason a slasher movie should be cut back to PG-13. Though, I must say, Salt impressed me and left me hoping for a sequel. After all, its not too late to get Matt Damon in Salt 2.<br/><br/>Starring: Angelina Jolie, Liev Schreiber, and Chiwetel Ejiofor. Directed by: Phillip Noyce."

","Russian spies? How retro. How old school. Ha ha.<br/><br/>Oh, wait, didn't they arrest a bunch recently?<br/><br/>Lots of potential in rebooting the old Cold War Paranoia trope. ""Salt"" mostly squanders that potential to be a flat-out car-crash and punch-out actioner. Nothing wrong with that. Pass the popcorn.<br/><br/>Posts here reference the Bourne and Bond movies in describing ""Salt,"" but the movie it reminded me most of is ""The Fugitive."" ""Salt"" is one long improbable chase as our CIA agent protagonist Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie) runs around Washington and New York trying to clear her name and prevent the assassination of the Russian president, who's in town to attend the funeral of the American vice president.<br/><br/>The entire movie is a series of escape set pieces. Her escape from the CIA office. The chase on foot through the streets of D.C. The escape from her apartment. Inside the cathedral during the funeral. Her escape after being arrested. Her escape from the barge. And, finally, her escape from the helicopter.<br/><br/>The movie delays letting on whether Salt is a goodie or a baddie. I was not fooled. For all the cops, Secret Service, CIA, FBI, etc., she took on — beating them up, breaking their bones, knocking them unconscious, shooting them in the arm — she never kills a single one. What does that tell you?<br/><br/>BTW, how did she get out of that interrogation room in the beginning?<br/><br/>A franchise being set up and I think we can anticipate the return of Evelyn Salt, a new movie avenger against a team of men and women trained from childhood, in a secret compound in Russia, to become CIA agents. At the same time, Salt will remain a hunted woman in America. I anticipate the moment in the next film when she tells her boss over the phone, ""You look tired. Why don't you get some rest.""<br/><br/>On display here is one of Hollywood's newest action gimmicks -- Salt is coming at a guy to deliver a punch, but first she runs up the wall.<br/><br/>The franchise needs a thrilling theme song, something like the Bourne movies' ""Extreme Ways"" by Moby.<br/><br/>I would have given this 6 instead of 7 stars, but the movie contains the wildest strangulation scene in the history of cinema."

We can hardly understand who is with or against whom and why since sometimes some characters' behaviours are contradictory.

","Angelina Jolie is Jason Bourne in a skirt in this politically charged action thriller from director Philip Noyce. Jolie plays CIA agent Evelyn Salt who is revealed to be a Russian sleeper agent planted in the U.S. to carry out a plot called Day X. But have years of living the America way swayed her allegiance?<br/><br/>If there's one thing I find even more puzzling than Angelina Jolie as a sex symbol (the gaunt face and puffy lip thing does nothing for me), it's her status as an action star: here, she is completely unconvincing as a highly trained special agent able to defeat countless enemy in unarmed combat, fall from great heights with nary a scratch, and leap from truck roof to truck roof on a busy freeway. Her slight frame looks as though it would smash on impact.<br/><br/>Noyce conducts proceedings with an assured hand, and achieves a gritty realism to the violence, but the complete miscasting of his skeletal star and a number of action sequences that push plausibility to the limits make this a somewhat frustrating watch overall."
"JamesHitchcock","6","2","6","1 June 2012"," Hollywood Russophobia
","According to one story, Angelina Jolie was once asked if she would consider playing a Bond girl, but replied that she was more interested in playing James Bond himself. Lara Croft, her character in the ""Tomb Raider"" films, is essentially a Jane Bond figure, with a bit of Indiana Joan mixed in, and in ""Salt"" she gets another chance to play a secret agent in an action film. The screenplay, in fact, was originally written with a male protagonist named Edwin Salt, with the intention that he should be played by Tom Cruise. Cruise, however, pulled out, fearing that the character was too similar to his Ethan Hunt in the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise, and Salt underwent a sex change and was renamed Evelyn. (The use of a sexually ambiguous Christian name- think of Evelyn Waugh- may have been a deliberate hint at the character's male origins.) <br/><br/>Evelyn Salt is a CIA agent who is ""outed"" as a Russian double agent by a defector. (In a dramatic coup de cinéma, this revelation occurs during an interrogation being carried out by Salt herself). The defector alleges that Salt is part of a Russian plot to infiltrate the United States by using English-speaking sleeper agents trained from childhood. He also alleges that she intends to assassinate the Russian President at the funeral of the American vice president, who has recently died. Salt protests her innocence, but is arrested by her CIA colleagues. She succeeds, however, in escaping from custody and goes on the run, fearful for the life of her husband. I won't attempt to summarise the further twists and turns of the plot as, in common with most modern spy thrillers, this one is extremely convoluted. The questions which remain to be answered are (i) Is Salt really a Russian agent? (ii) Does she really intend to kill the Russian President or to protect him? and (iii) Are there any other Russian sleepers in high places? <br/><br/>Much of the action is implausible; Salt seems to possess a preternatural ability to outwit her adversaries and to escape from the most desperate situations without a scratch, but in the context of an action thriller film, especially within the spy genre, this sort of implausibility is not really a drawback as such films are not normally aiming at realism. One would have to be very naïve, for example, to imagine that the Bond films give a genuinely accurate picture of the abilities of the average MI6 agent. There are, however, a couple of more serious faults. There are a number of plot holes; it is not really made clear why Salt goes on the run, and her motivation at other points in the film remains obscure.<br/><br/>The film is also a good example of Hollywood Russophobia. Tinseltown likes to pride itself on its liberalism, but can be surprisingly conservative in this respect. I sometimes think that American film producers are living in some sort of alternative reality in which the Berlin Wall never fell, the Soviet Union survived into the twenty-first century and the Cold War is still continuing. This tendency was particularly marked in the 1990s in films like ""Crimson Tide"", ""GoldenEye"", ""The Peacemaker"", ""Air Force One"", and ""Fair Game"", all of which featured Russian villains; when they weren't spies they were gangsters or renegade Army officers. ""The Sum of All Fears"" is a post-2000 example. ""Salt"", however, is even more conservative than any of those films; it came out as recently as 2010 but could have been made, with only a few changes to the plot, in the fifties, sixties or seventies. (""Telefon"" from 1977 has a rather similar plot involving Soviet sleeper agents).<br/><br/>I have never cared for Phillip Noyce's previous collaboration with Angelina Jolie, ""The Bone Collector"", but he is generally a competent director of thrillers, with the likes of ""Dead Calm"" and ""Patriot Games"" to his credit, and she is one of the more charismatic female stars currently working in the industry. That the film is able to rise above all its plot-holes and its spy-thriller clichés is largely down to his skill as a director and her charisma. The plot may be preposterous, yet it is also ingenious, and Noyce and Jolie made it fast-moving and entertaining enough to keep me watching, For all its flaws ""Salt"" was a film which, overall, I enjoyed, which is why it gets an above-average mark. 6/10"

","This movie was pretty crappy. I started my long history (soon to be) with IMDb just to review this movie. Sorry Jolie... your acting was good but the plot was sh*t. I think it was about 15 minutes into the movie when I was able to correctly guess the outcome of the whole plot. Very predictable this is. I'm not joking. Completely unrealistic. Yes, I understand it's an action movie and that Rambo couldn't really kill a billion people without catching a few bullets to the dome but this is just dumb common sense. A normal person would not carry out the actions this intelligent CIA operative seems to do every ten minutes. My time is done... dumb movie. period. ...cmp"

","It starts out well as a great fast-paced movie with all of the action and extremities. Angelina Jolie plays Evelyn Salt who is a CIA agent and is completely out of everyone's league. Of course it's a bit out of whack being that she is a light, small, petite woman who can perform in ways no one else can. I guess that is part of the magic of Hollywood. She has the strength, speed, mobility, skill and intelligence of no other character in the movie. The acting was acceptable and very well communicated by the entire cast. Angelina taking the main role, Liev Schreiber, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Daniel Olbrychski, August Diehl, Daniel Pearce, Hunt Block and the many others did a fantastic job in bringing you into the story. The story-line is intense and keeps the audience interested on the edge of their seat, especially because it surrounds itself around the politics of the white house bringing it to more of a personal level. What I did not like was that in the end it left me wanting more. I felt that there should have been more closure.. but that's just me. It was almost as if there should have been some justice made for the character of, ""Evelyn Salt"". Although, others may find the end to be just right."

","A previous viewer was spot on when he or she said that no one with a mental age higher than 12 could enjoy this movie. Even action/adventure movies need some minimum degree of credibility, and nothing, absolutely nothing in this movie rings true. The story is the worn out cliché of a plot to get the U.S. and Russia to attack each other. ""SPECTRE"" in the James Bond flicks ran that one ragged years ago. And the James Bond flicks were meant to be viewed as cartoons, so the over-the-top charades in them could be enjoyed for the fun they were. The same shtick in a movie that wants to taken seriously as an action flick simply just doesn't work. It starts right at the beginning with Jolie's character escaping from a high security facility and jumping onto vehicle after vehicle from overpasses with nary a bruise, then later dispatching dozens of armed thugs with a few karate kids. Fuggedaboutit. <br/><br/>The really depressing thing is that dreck like this can be swallowed by the viewing public."

Seeing a hero who is betrayed and destroyed systematically by an ""enemy"" who doesn't look like anything we've seen in real life it's a little bit too much to be taken serious, but it is intended to be seen as a fiction story and nothing real, so shouldn't be criticized because of it. Better we should focus on the actions and fights in the movie that are 'top notch' and with stunts unbelievable well done. We ran out of ideas and things got repetitive in the new movies we see nowadays, and it is normal to be so, but we do it better and better every time, and making a new movie with old subjects it's not a waste of time, instead should be a relaxing and enjoyable experience.

","This is an absolutely absurd movie. From an intriguing plot line, the movie just doesn't deliver. There are holes in the plot that one could drive a Mack Truck through and not come close to scraping the sides. Far too much time is spent on chase / action scenes with no plot development. Unless one is fond of James Bond escapes, the action scenes don't deliver. Good fiction is the willing suspension of disbelief - the absurdities throughout the movie never make compelling watching. Salt's ability to escape time-after- time from impossible situations is possible only if all the security forces (American / Russian / Korean) majored in stupid. The Keystone Kops are geniuses in comparison. All that was lacking from the sound was a laugh track for all the silly escapes. The acting of the major characters is wooden by all.

I watched Inception in the summer and now I think to myself 'God, those were the days when acting was considered an art and directors thought much more about their audience.'

","'Salt' is the tale about a CIA operative accused of being a Russian spy. If everything involved in the production of 'Salt' had gone to plan then we'd be talking about a very different, and much less interesting film. Originally written for a male lead - specifically Tom Cruise, the production of 'Salt' came upon the difficult task of replacing Salt after Cruise dropped out. Jolie, who had notoriously said she had wanted to play Bond - not a Bond girl - was offered this role as a sort of replacement. Edwin Salt became Evelyn Salt, and things got interesting... <br/><br/>'Salt' doesn't exactly have the most compelling of plots, despite the many twists and turns the audience meanders on throughout the course of the film. However what it lacks in story it makes up for in raw, imaginative action. Had Cruise taken the role, 'Salt' would have been an unimaginative, unoriginal cheap Bourne imitation. With Jolie at the helm however, the film sizzles with the strong masculinity in order to adopt such a role, as well as the frailty she feels as a woman whose husband is missing. From what I can gather, they production team didn't feel the need to hold back on their lead when it came to the hard physicality of the role, and there are times throughout the film were you found yourself seriously impressed with both the fights scenes and the action. Unlike Jolie's last endeavour in the action genre with 'Wanted', Salt is very much more realistic, with Salt utilising all the things she can in order to over power these men, and out run them. <br/><br/>The other members of the cast were not un-sensational however with Jolie in almost every scene it was hard really for any of the attention to be drawn onto them. Liev Schreiber seemed comfortable in his role as Salt's friend and colleague and his character seemed, for much of the movie to be following the same doubts and unanswered questions the audience did. <br/><br/>While 'Salt' won't be winning any Oscar's any time soon, it does achieve what it sets out to - in being an action packed and twisting thriller. Jolie definitely made a potentially flaky film much improved and while I didn't find this as enthralling as 'Mr and Mrs Smith', her performance in this in both her stunts and her acting were much better than in the lack lustre 'Wanted'. Judging by the ending, and from what I've heard in the press, a sequel is sure to be on its way. And if it's done properly with a script that allows us more of an emotional attachment to Salt then it really could potentially replace Daniel Craig's pathetic excuse of a Bond in the action genre. Jolie truly is at the forefront of this genre and no other actress does action like she does. She's the Sigourney Weaver of the noughties while still maintaining a reputation as an incredible actress. I look forward to more... <br/><br/>Overall, a solid 8/10."
"Floated2","6","2","6","27 August 2010"," A fun and entertaining movie
","Angelina Jolie's latest film is this action spy thriller titled Salt. That the title of the film and her character's name. Seems like a carbon copy of a female Bourne movie. At first I didn't know what to expect from this film but I read many reviews, positive and negative and I finally got around to seeing this film. I thought it was pretty well done, the action scenes were great but the plot was predictable and kind of hard to believe. Though its on of those movies that make you feel excited with action, and it delivers. Granted it was a summer action flick to rack in a ton of cash, and it succeeded in doing so.<br/><br/>Many things I like and disliked in this film. The only real issue that I have is that the film didn't fully explore the protagonist's inner psyche. There are some flashbacks that tell flesh out the character, but a little bit more would've been nice in addition to more exposition surrounding her character. Also, I felt the film should've been longer. The notion of a female spy is an exciting and intriguing idea. They should have added an extra 20 mins to the film but overall it was good. It is 100 mins (1hr, 40mins) but it had about 7 mins of end credits, so it was really closer to 90 mins. I personally think it they extended a few scenes, it would have been better. But it is what it is, and it was pretty decent in general. Also the ending leaves open the possibility of a sequel and I for one can't wait to see what they come up with next. It's not as cerebral as the Bourne films, but it will entertain you for an hour and a half. Give and take the price of what its worth, that's a good deal. ==================================================================== ======== As for a rewatch (07/19/17') this film is still quite an entertaining spy thriller. Though some things do not feel as good upon a second review. Perhaps the film did not age well, considering since it's release there have been better films of this kind of genre. Things are messy in the second half and do require of paying close attention. Also some of the twists and turns aren't as clever as I'd remember. Rating change from 7 to 6."

","Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie) is a CIA agent. We find out early on that she may be a double agent, when she is identified as such by Russian agent Orlov. But might she be a triple agent? It seems her immediate boss Winter (Liev Schreiber) is on her side, but the Internal Affairs-type bloke Peabody (Chiwetel Ejiofor) has it in for her, so she is fighting pursuit from her own people as she goes on the run.<br/><br/>This espionage nonsense has a plot which is not so much incoherent as improbable, and is a bit too frantic for its own good - the large part of its running length is devoted to chases. The story has a couple of beats which weren't quite what I expected - welcome enough,but they didn't make it any more believable. Though the action sequences are mostly fun, there was stuff which was, frankly, ludicrous (the lift shaft descent springs to mind), and the whole thing came over as rather dour.<br/><br/>This film passed the time adequately, but did no more than that."

","When Salt was first commissioned it was seen as a project for Tom Cruise but he rejected it seeing it as being too similar to the Mission Impossible Series. But Angelina Jolie heard about the project she saw it chance to start a female spy franchise.<br/><br/>Jolie plays Evelyn Salt, a CIA officer plays on moving out of field work for the sake of her marriage. Yet her plans are destroyed when a Russian defector, Vassily Orlov (Daniel Olbrychski) accuses her of being a Russian Sleeper agent assigned to kill the Russian President. He claims Salt has been trained to since she was a child. With Counter-Intelligence Peabody (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and her boss Ted Winter (Liev Schreiber) wanting her for questioning Salt has to go on the run and raises the question: who is Salt? 2010's summer season has been pretty lacklustre, with only Inception and Toy Story 3 truly impressing and Iron Man 2 being entertaining. Salt is more like The A-Team, its decent but nothing special. It is however better then Knight and Day. Jolie is convincing is a top spy, showing she can really kick ass. I love that she was a very resource character and a little like Sydney Bristow from Alias. SPOILER ALERT: However despite the flashbacks there is no reason given to why Salt turned against her Russian masters SPOILER ALERT OVER. She is ably supported by Schreiber and Ejiofor, both very good actors but they do offer a standard performance, with Schreiber fairly a little better. There are far from bad but there had little to work on.<br/><br/>The director of the piece was Philip Noyce, an old fashion style director who has form for spy thrillers in the form of the best two Tom Clancy adaptations and The Saint. He can direct an action scene and it was refreshing for the most part that he only uses CGI when he has to. Jolie looks great when she is fighting, even if there a little over edited. He also keeps the film at a first pace, allowing the film to be pretty entertaining. But many of the action sequence didn't feel as a consequence or real as the new Bond films or the Bourne series, which gave though two series there edge.<br/><br/>Kurt Wimmer did write some interesting ideas involving Russian sleepers which was very timely considering events on the East Coast of America in 2010. There was a decent element idea of a rogue ex-KGB agent awaking sleepers for his own reasons, but other elements were bit over the top and ridiculous. Luckily Noyce doesn't slow down to allow us to think about them for too long. Yet they could and should have been tighter and the way the film ends make a sequel very difficult to work. I was also able to guess the big plot twist very early on.<br/><br/>Overall a decent enough action film but there is no need for a sequel."

","Similar to The Hobbit, Bourne 4 finds itself in the middle of no-man's-land with little flavour to wet fans appetites. Jolie's latest heroine excursion as Salt proves to be less than substantial for those hoping not to find a film that seems to dither on occasional blasts of adrenaline, to twists which fall out of grasp to be tied up neat enough to be passable.<br/><br/>Unlike Bourne's rediscovery of identity, Salt is on the run to clear her name and save her husband after a Russian defector accuses her of being KGB sleeper agent. Sadly another misleading trailer leaves an almost bitterly disappointed finished result. It never successfully seems to blend the style and motivation of Salt without going slightly daft in the plot to make the film more definable in its own right.<br/><br/>Salt (the character) takes to new extremes, the lengths of modern day heroes/heroines. The change in lead (it was originally going to be Tom Cruise as the lead) has, if anything, shown Jolie again being superiorly capable in her role as a heroine with a deadly affinity with weapons. And while it may not have been satisfying watching the clunky plot unfold, Angelina has the sex appeal and grace to pull off what a younger budding amateur could not have done to the movie; make it (mostly) work."

","This turned out to be one of those over-the-top but real decent thrill-ride type actioners. Though there are those out there who just won't cut Angelina Jolie a break, even the haters can't deny that the girl can act. She's excellent in this film, about one of the CIA's top interrogators who's accused of being a Russian sleeper agent. It's fairly early in the film when the action begins and it runs and runs from there on. There's a good twist to plot much later on and personally, I like movies that let you try to figure them out as they go along, rather than force feeding you the answers with dumbed down dialog and screechy music because the writers assume the audience is too stupid to get the obvious story movements. This one doesn't do that. If you're not a fan of crazy stunt sequences that no one (in reality) would come out of without broken bones, much less survive, then maybe you won't enjoy this flick too much. Otherwise, see it. It's a blast, it's got a good cast (sorry for the rhyme there) with Liev Schreiber (always excellent) and Chiwetel Ejiofor (ditto), and the storyline rips right along. Check it out."

She was very compelling to watch as an action star, and fit the role well with her athletic moves and lithe body along with her notable acting as a ruthless, cunning and deadly woman. This movie keeps you guessing, and has a good and interesting story line along with explosive action. Some people complained of many slow parts I noticed in other reviews, but I didn't see this at all, the movie runs at a quick pace and keeps the tempo high.

And only Salt was the only person who could stop him.(this part resembles 'The Sum Of All Fears')<br/><br/>""They took everything from me"" spouted Salt to her CIA superior, Agent Peabody alluding how the Russian spymaster orchestrated her parents 'murder' under the guise of a car accident as she was the only survivor secretly indoctrinated and trained and how his spymaster shot her husband in front of her eyes - she wanted something - REVENGE against the Russians intelligence.<br/><br/>This movie has some resemblance with 'US Marshall'(Tommy Lee Jones & Wesley Snipes).<br/><br/>Salt did not assassinate the Russian President, only 'sedated' him with extracts from a spider (she may have learned this from her husband). And having the chance to shoot Agent Peabody, she did not. The same scene happened in US Marshall where a CIA operative (Wesley Snipes) framed for murder and on the run, having a clear shot at Deputy US Marshall, did not shoot him in his head but shoulder. The same instances begs one similar question : If a fugitive on the run did not shoot and kill one of their most formidable and ruthless pursuer,- WHY?! ( there might be persuasive reasons to believe that the fugitive may be innocent)<br/><br/>This 90 minute movie is filled with non-stop suspense, great actions, a worthwhile a 2nd and 3rd watch. I am giving this movie 8.5/10 *<br/><br/>The tagline catch : ""Who is Salt?"" Answer : Salt is everywhere. She probably has written her own commenteries here under a handle. After all, who could guess Salt's next step. I could not, but 1 thing for sure - expect a sequel. That is guaranteed. She's still on the run like 'The A Team', remember?"

There are some who are proclaiming it as one of the best action flicks of the year (Roger Ebert's 4 Star Review) and others who are saying it's just another mind-less action flick. <br/><br/>The first 45 minutes are outstanding. They were written, acted, and directed on spot, in my opinion. There was mystery, action, thrills and chills. The second half gets more into the story, usually that would be a good thing. Here, it's not. It's writing moves way too fast, becomes preposterous, confusing and just downright sloppy at times. However the director does the best that he can and salvages some of the ridiculousness that comes with the second 45 minutes, with the help of a solid, consistent performance from Angelina Jolie. <br/><br/>The cinematography, sets, visuals, sound all bring to the table to come out with a fine action thriller.

","Angelina Jolie's latest actioner Salt might have its fair share of explosive action, but even though it promises a quickened heart rate, it lacks any real substance, just like the mineral from which it gets its title. Ultimately, you will leave the theater wanting more. But did I like Salt? Perhaps (In fact, maybe a little too much). <br/><br/>I was expecting constant action in Salt, but what I was not prepared for was how absolutely idiotic it would be. From what I assumed was a political thriller woven through an action template, it was quickly revealed to be nothing of the sort. The spy setup is simply an excuse to have Jolie perform impossible stunts and escape from any fathomable situation. These kinetic sequences, though ludicrous, are not what inhibits Salt from reaching loftier heights, but rather the plot-hole filled story which is as eye-roll inducing as it is perfunctory.<br/><br/>As you might have gathered, the plot is moot, but the opening finds our heroine in a situation that could only be described as hairy but like most every problem she faces, proves to be one cool customer. We are fast-tracked, more or less, to Salt's interrogation of a KGB defector, who subsequently accuses her of being not from Uncle Sam's side of the pond. So off she goes to clear her name, or whatever, and destroys half of the city in the process. But hey, I would let Angelina Jolie trash my place any day.<br/><br/>The plot plays second-fiddle to Jolie's sultry screen presence and the noisy, crash-filled action set pieces, but with its PG-13 rating, it gives the target audience everything they could want in a summer blockbuster. Like many actors who are slowly passing through or well within middle age, Jolie has matured and brings significantly more gravitas to the proceedings then she ever did in Tomb Raider. Her co- stars do fine work as well, Liev Schreiber plays the long-time friend and co-worker to able results, but the standout, even in a limited role, is the superb and underrated Chiwetel Ejiofor. He is memorable in any project he is associated with, if you remember, he certainly shined above all else in last year's 2012.<br/><br/>The true strength of Salt lies within the action sequences which are elegantly staged, white-knuckle and most importantly decipherable. Unlike most, I am not bothered by what has been dubbed ""shaky can"" filmmaking, but I will eat some of my words as the clearly presented action scenes here are refreshing. The style is reminiscent of the latest Matt Damon spy actioners. Salt could just as easily be called ""The Bourne Salt-imatum,"" but I suppose the pedigree of the ludicrous plot sets this blockbuster on a decidedly lower plane.<br/><br/>Amidst its inherent lunacy, Salt never becomes tedious, self-serious or boring for that matter. The pace is brisk and the action flashy so if you are looking for intelligence go see Inception for a second time instead."

","""Salt"" is a spy thriller directed by Phillip Noyce starring Angelina Jolie. The writer is Kurt Wimmer and you may have seen ""Law Abiding Citizen"" from him. Or ""Total Recall"" which was released after ""Salt"" though. For Jolie and Noyce, it is the second collaboration after ""The Bone Collector"" over 10 years earlier.<br/><br/>The film starts with a Russian suspect actually telling that Jolie is a Russian spy and her identity as a CIA operative is fake. She flees right away, allegedly to find her husband, so we are never sure what she really is. Initially, I thought the Russian guy tried to frame her and she is really innocent, but when she is in the metro or later kills the Russian president, we find out there is obviously truth involved with what the Russian guy said. There were few really great moments in this movie, but it is a good watch from start to finish. Special mention to August Diehl, who is becoming quickly one of Germany's most notable Hollywood actors alongside Brühl and two-time Academy Award winner Christoph Waltz if you count him (he's Austrian).<br/><br/>Sometimes the whole Jolie against everybody (Koreans, Russians, Americans, her own husband) plot felt unrealistic as it was simply too much centered on her and sacrificed credibility for that. Also, it is really enough to (try to) kill either the Russian or the American President in one movie. It doesn't have to be both of them. Actually, I would have liked this film to end after 55 minutes with her having killed the Russian President and being arrested. But obviously it did not as we also still had to find out what was going on with her husband. Afterward it was maybe one or two plot twists too many although I liked the scene in which she kills Schreiber's (pretty underrated actor) character almost at the end. The actual ending then really offers room for a sequel and it does not look too unlikely. So maybe we will be getting ""Salt 2"" in 2 or 3 years time. If we do, I hope they manage to take the strengths from the first film and include them again, but maybe without the clichés and without 100% focus and heroism on Jolie. Instead, some more realism please. One example for this was when Schreiber's character tells her that he was top of his group, the best of them all. That moment I knew he would fight Salt later on and lose the fight as this film won't miss a chance to tell everybody that Jolie (and her character) are the best and nobody else is.<br/><br/>So yeah as a whole I enjoyed this movie and I recommend watching it if you are either very much interested in spy thrillers or just a big Angelina Jolie fan. I just wish they would have chosen a more convincingly realistic approach to some of the dramatic scenes such as not all doors would have closed the very moment Jolie's character was about to run through them early on for example."

Proving that she is a Patriot, Salt with all her incisive skills struggled prodigious obstacles that increased the story's suspense;However, the music's choice and the movie's structure, which were directed by Noyce weren't as expected. <br/><br/>The director,Phillip Noyce, had some minor issues that disrupted the movie sequence which affected the presentation of the movie.One of that problems was the choice of music it wasn't synced to the scenes that was played at that moment .The choosing of the story was perfected, but, lamentably, the movie didn't have a budget that supports such a story. Procuring only 110 million to produce a movie that needed a great number of equipments and work, the workmen hadn't had the enough equipment, yet they had a crew who with their countless efforts reach a huge success .The movie was filmed in an amount that does not exceed four months, from March to June. The movie was filmed in Washington D.C ,some parts of New York and Russia. Angelina Jolie had done a great amount of hard work so that she can be allowed to do the stunts herself and that is what she did. Although she had a small accident while doing a stunt, she returned to filming right after she had checked it in the hospital.<br/><br/>Comparing this movie to other work, we could ostensibly recognize some errors in choosing the appropriate scene in ""Salt"". As an archetype, ""Taken"", which is directed by Pierre Morel, manifest how the scenes were adequate. In ""Taken"", when the father receives a call from his daughter that she is going to get kidnapped, this appealing scene evokes the audience in an attractive atmosphere. Directing the movie structure in an inadequate method, Noyce made tremendous mistakes in the scenes, where they filmed the movie. For a paradigm, when Natasha Chenkov(Angelina Jolie ) met with Oleg Vasilyevich Orlov (August Diehl) after killing the Russian president in a ship that didn't look like a ship who mercenaries live in. It looked like a place that was abandoned for more than 10 years. Additionally, in that same scene when she killed Daniel Olbrychski (Oleg Vasilyevich Orlov) and decided to kill all the remaining members of the brotherhood, she easily executed that by holding a few bombs and shooting 3 to 4 bullets, Which sounds unreal in our life."

","I didn't really know much about, or what to expect with this one, just a film I thought I'd get around to seeing sometime. OK, yes, the plot was full of holes, but it was quite thrilling and employed some good ideas. Certainly one or two things I didn't see coming.<br/><br/>Of particular note to me was Hunt Block as the American President - have been watching reruns of Knots Landing in which he plays a much younger rookie politician - good to know that he finally made it to the top (even though he died in Knots Landing!) If you want a bit of excitement and escapism, Salt is recommended. If you're a bit of a geek when it comes to the technicals, then don't bother."

","Peabody: How many more like you are there? Salt: Like me? None. Like him? More than you or I can handle alone.<br/><br/>Do you need a bit of salt here? Yep, preferably with large grains, because you need that when you watch this movie. Do not expect a realistic movie, because then you'll be disappointed. ""Salt"" is a excellent spy action movie that rages like a TGV. From the moment Salt is accused of the fact that she is a Russian spy who has been specially trained by some Russian extremist who has devised a master plan to give orphans a U.S. education and then send them to the U.S. to wait for ""Day X"" after which they each perform their specific job, it all goes very fast. Before you know it, you've been watching this movie for half an hour. The action scenes are masterfully portrayed and follow each other in rapid succession. <br/><br/>Some scenes are a bit over the top and hard to believe. The jumping from one truck to another makes you scratch your head after a while. The floating down in an elevator shaft looks awful and ridiculously unrealistic. As Salt supposedly eliminates the Russian president, she's removed from there in a police car with two extra patrol cars. I think in reality, half the U.S. military would accompany her. The part where she manipulates the driver with the taser to accelerate and steer is hopelessly laughable. And then there is the remarkable fact how she recovers after several terrible blows and hits, and then starts running again like a trained Olympic athlete. Besides , I do think that if Angelina Jolie would participate again in another action movie that involves scenes where she has to run a lot, she better takes a personal trainer to teach her a bit more running techniques. At times she looks like a running broomstick with huge weights on her ankles . <br/><br/>I'm not a big ""Angelina Jolie""-fan. Yes she has a certain charisma and yes she has a wonderfully sensual look in her eyes. But more than once I caught myself with the thought that she would be sticking to a wall with those big lips of her, after being smacked against it by an opponent.In fact she really looked like a walking anorexic patient and actually asked myself how the hell she could handle those tough trained guys. In reality, she would be crushed like an annoying fly.<br/><br/>The story on its own is incredibly predictable and totally innovative. Even the sabotaging at the last moment of a nuclear attack has been used ad nauseam. Also the fact that her partner Ted is a result of the Russian breeding ground is something you also saw coming a mile away. The only plot twist that was in this movie was when she planted the broken bottle in the Adam's apple of Orlov. Until that very moment I was sure that she was indeed a spy. Liev Schreiber didn't make a smashing impression. The whole movie he was a paragon of measured coolness with a pronounced stoic expression on his face.<br/><br/>All in all a relaxing action movie with a thin story and improbabilities that blows you away. I only found the end actually brilliant and an outspoken open end to make a sequel. And according to IMDb it's already in the making. For me definitely a film you can't skip.<br/><br/>More reviews at http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be/"
"benettfreeman","4","1","2","28 December 2011"," Like 'Hanna', this is formulaically disappointing
","Like Hanna before it, this movie starts well, and has just about enough action to carry it through to the end. What both films lack, however, is a conceptually-meaningful story to keep the validity of the idea alive. <br/><br/>It seems a formula has now been developed for a certain breed of films - that have (comparatively) intricate plots, hi-octane action, and the star-studded cast and big budget to realise the project. <br/><br/>But it seems pointless to me to make a movie that is ultimately so ludicrous that it would be surprising if anyone wants to watch it a second time.<br/><br/>I love spy films, and I love action movies, and I REALLY love plot twists. Salt has all of these elements, and Angelina Jolie, to her credit, performs well within the role. But the plot, when fully revealed, is neither believable or really very inventive, and the final plot twists render the whole previous story rather ridiculous.<br/><br/>Both Hanna and Salt deal with children who have been conditioned to grow into superspies, and yet I have to admit that however disappointed I was at the end of Hanna, that film does work hard to make the story more believable, grounding some of the set pieces within what look like real situations and places. Salt, on the other hand, jumps the shark and seems to take pride in how it can push the boundaries of incredulity with every successive twist.<br/><br/>Hanna left me disappointed because the weight of the content at the beginning was quite high (the situation of the trained assassin escaping capture and going on the run, and having to cope with all of the psychological trauma it unleashes), but runs dry by the end - Cate Blanchett's killing signifying the death of the believability of the story and the emotional investment I had in the fate of Hanna.<br/><br/>Salt disappointed me on a whole new level because it began looking like a David Mamet film and yet ended more resemblant of Equilibrium or V for Vendetta, yet both those film's conceptual integrities remained sturdy throughout, whereas Salt's is sacrificed in favour of outlandish action. <br/><br/>If in the future there are more films made in this specific genre (spy action chase, you might call it), I hope they are a lot more intellectually fulfilling and daring (think Ronin) and less formulaic."
"glenjordanspangler","Null","1","2","3 October 2011"," Why you should and shouldn't see Salt
","Salt's colleagues wonder if she is doing all of that running, jumping, shooting, exploding, and hair-dying because she actually is a Russian agent, programmed years ago to assassinate someone, or for some innocent reason such as concern for her husband or worry that she may have left the iron on or forgotten to feed the dog.<br/><br/>From the moment Salt flees, the movie is a clockwork of kinetic energy, gravity and timing. The stunts, which account for much if not most of the screen time, are superbly choreographed, and apparently many of them were executed by Jolie herself.<br/><br/>As evidenced by the poster above, Jolie can convey a knowing, beautifully cold efficiency with one glance. When not leaping from the top of one speeding truck onto another while dodging bullets, Jolie manages to juxtapose this aura with the occasional glimpse of anger, fear, grief or near-panic.<br/><br/>The premise and plot are unlikely but cleverly assembled. Early on you'll formulate a theory as to what's happening, but you will question it more than once before the truth is revealed.<br/><br/>Why you should see it You love the thought of James Bond-style action combined with a who-can-you-trust puzzle. Angelina Jolie.<br/><br/>Why you should avoid it You're the type who asks a companion to explain movies to you, loudly, in the theater. You resent not knowing something, because wondering feels too much like work. Loyalty to Jennifer Aniston.<br/><br/>--from my review at www.1man365movies.com"

","Don't expect a masterpiece. It is not. But it is a good action film and you can enjoy it a lot provided you accept the clichés that come with the genre.<br/><br/>Of course the first agent shown as the victim of the monstrous communist North Koreans has to be the good one, even if it is a double or triple agent. In the same way the first American agent shown as snow white and crystal clear has to be a traitor and a double agent.<br/><br/>So what is the difference of this film as compared to Bourne, Stallone and Terminator? The first element is that there are so many levels of secret agents that ignore one another that the Russians will inevitably lose. They have yet an easy task infiltrating the USA to the top, except the President of course; But this system at one moment has to fail, especially when they start taking hostage the people who are close to their agents and then killing these hostages in cold blood when the effect has been reached, or they think it has. Then the double secret agent has nothing left to lose.<br/><br/>Infiltrating the USA is as easy as easy can be because they are a technological sewage or wasteland as for security and screening people and events. Even the procedure to start a nuclear war is so flimsy with confrontation of simple digital signals or alphanumerical codes via machines and nothing else is of course a farce.<br/><br/>But good is always the victor in these films. The most positive element is that the main character is a woman, which will satisfy the transfer desires of girls and women in the audience to be able to identify with that demoniac agent impersonated by Angelina Jolie. That's a good change in the genre.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"
"TheHrunting","6","1","2","5 July 2011"," Who needs pepper when you've got Salt?
","Usher in another super-trained movie like ""The Bourne Identity,"" where the action is constant, over the top and swiftly moves from one kinetic reflex to the other with only a fraction of a second to think in between. <br/><br/>Agent Salt (Jolie) works for the C.I.A. On her way out of a day's work with home life on her mind, a Russian defector walks in. Salt approaches with arms crossed while he's tested with high tech lie detectors and sophisticated fact checks. Without sending off any red flags, he tells a story about an elaborate training program designed to infiltrate the U.S. with Russian spies. It started with the assassination Kennedy, though this time the goal is to take out the Russian president. Is this guy loopy or just stuck in the Cold War days, or what? At the close, he names Evelyn Salt, his interrogator, as the spy. Her boss Ted (Liev Schreiber) vouches for her innocence, while the other head-honcho Peabody (Chiwetel Ejiofor) plays it by the book and wants her in custody till things are cleared up. She can't get ahold of her loving husband Mike--a German national who got her out of a rut in North Korea two years earlier--and makes a break for it and goes on the run like ""The Fugitive"" meets a female version of ""XXX.""<br/><br/>The action happens like a linear video game as it feels rehearsed and formulaic, than being unpredictable and truly challenging. Salt has an uncannily high level of intuition to the point of being God-like instead of some hundred-something-pound person made out of flesh and blood. She'll easily jump on and off high speeding trucks on the highway like she's Spider-Woman or her bones are grafted from steel. Taking an early leave off a moving subway train isn't a stretch, neither is getting into multiple car accidents without being the least bit phased. You're supposed to suspend your disbelief because they flash some credentials on a computer screen and talk about past training. It does have a constant traction forward with a thriller-like pacing as something is always at her disposal to use or manipulate. <br/><br/>Salt's time on the run gets deeper and deeper and more and more conspiratorial. Tables get turned, traitors become uncovered and human lives are mowed through like freshly cut grass. Where audiences thought ""The Hunt for Red October"" was the last of its kind, we get pretty a spy popping up in real-life news stories after getting caught in the millennium. Though unintentional to capitalizing on the newly found panic, this picture never lets up from being a movie, one that's all about cinematic entertainment at its most primal element, enough to add twists and turns without confusion as the script could probably be read in a single visit to the loo. Getting the viewer to think is only incidental and not necessarily a direct result as everything is already laid out with suspenseful music, fast paced setups and quick edits; half the time Jolie puts on a stone-faced expression and the other is more exciting when she lets loose with a grimace. A large portion of the action in ""Salt"" is like a piece of toast that's smoothed over with butter but missing the crunch. As exaggerated as it is, the showdown it built up to was definitely a clencher and kept the thrills consistent to the very end instead of coping out with a typical wrapped-up Hollywood finish.

"MLDinTN","6","1","2","10 May 2011"," Fair action movie, but still very unbelievable
","I liked the action scenes in this movie, but quite a few of them were still just absurd. Angelina Jolie plays a CIA agent whom was secretly trained as a child to be a Russian spy. She is living in America waiting for the green light. First, why would Russia want to start a war with America in today's world. Simple, they wouldn't. This plot is more for the times during the Cold War decades ago. But overlook this, and then you have a petite Jolie, playing Salt, whom jumps off semis and lands on vans and hangs own and is able to over power about 4 guys in a police car and kick them out the car and use a stun gun to control the driver, and she is able to get up and walk out of a totaled car after going over a bridge. Not to mention her alone is about to get by security to get in the church during the funeral. It just starts to get silly and why at the end in the room under ground would all the glass be bulletproof yet the walls are not surrounded by steel. Instead Salt is able to blast her way through the sheet rock to get to the control panel. Don't buy that.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: Jolie is good but is given some silly things to do. It still was exciting and I recommend it."
"BrianMemphis","Null","1","2","17 March 2011"," Entertaining Action with Throwback Plot
","The movie's action sequences are very entertaining, and it's unique to see a woman in a Bourne-style action role. However, many elements of the plot are not unique, since the idea of the forgotten Soviet sleeper agent has been used many times before (Telefon, Little Nikita, etc). 80s flashback nostalgia is very appealing right now on US television (see Chuck, Fringe) and makes an audience-friendly way to tie the action together. Complaints about the plot aside, the suspense works and the actors do a fine job.<br/><br/>Watching the endings of the two alternate versions provided on the DVD (extended version and director's version) really show how much a film can change with a few simple tweaks. The director's ending, with its voice over and the additional gunshot scene in the control room, raises the stakes higher for the characters. Makes me wonder what the process was - audience testing, etc they used to arrive at the theatrical ending."
"CelluloidDog","5","1","2","4 January 2011"," Tomb Raider meets Jason Bourne and no one wins
","Another entry into the superspy genre, this film stars Angelina Jolie who plays Evelyn Salt a CIA operative who gets framed or rather caught into action as a double agent. She eludes her American fellow agents, thwarts the Russian conspirators and smashes her way as a superheroine, superior to either JB: James Bond or Jason Bourne. Liev Schreiber is solid as her fellow agent in the CIA who sticks by her side. August Diehl is convincing as Evelyn's loving husband who never abandons her and changes her outlook on the world. Beware the superspy on a mission of vengeance! Phillip Noyce does a nice job of directing.<br/><br/>So that's the good, fun news. The not-so-good is the weak script, weak plot and just unconvincing action. Matt Damon's Jason Bourne is a bit more convincing, more human character. James Bond made more than a few human errors as in his Quantum of Solace. But at least the action is terrific. Perhaps it reminds me of La Femme Nikita without the stylish director of Luc Besson and the vulnerability of Anne Parillaud. Only in the opening spy trade-off do we really feel for Evelyn. If it stayed more to that path, it would have made a much better film. The rest of the way it is a charade or worst, a farce. It's a fine movie to watch on DVD, not to pay $10 for the theatre but to pass a rainy day with nothing to do but watch a mindless movie with a plot retold a hundred times.<br/><br/>I might give this film a 6 but it is so silly at times. Angelina's best action film was Tomb Raider. Here the writers decided it's Tomb Raider meets James Bond. Write a better script and give Evelyn a bit more vulnerability and we'll have an 8 of a movie."

I'm not a spy!"" You know, AJ seems to have been born for these sorts of scenes of violence.<br/><br/>Yeah. It was superb. It was stupendous. It was superlative.<br/><br/>In fact, it made watching the rest of this CIA/Double-Agent, dimwit drivel well-worth the 2 hours I wasted hoping (please-please-please) that darling AJ would once again be subjected to even more of the same sort of brutality. (Yep. That would've played quite nicely into satisfying one of my secret (shhh!) guilty pleasures. Indeed) <br/><br/>But, following this one, isolated instance AJ's frail-looking character always retained the upper hand (unfortunately) as she repeatedly pulverized and annihilated more bad guys than you could possibly shake a stick at.<br/><br/>This, of course, was one of ""Salt's"" major, messed-up downfalls.<br/><br/>If equal numbers of women had been included in all of agent Salt's kick-ass, Matrix-style brawling then, yes, its story might have held some potential. But, as it clearly stood, this film's sexually-biased, anti-Russian, male-annihilating message simply sucked, and then it sucked some more.<br/><br/>To have been fair to me as the viewer, I think that the tunnel-visioned screenwriters for this film could've at least tried to develop Evelyn Salt into something of an interesting and likable character. But no attempt was made in that direction, at all.<br/><br/>And, hey, let's face it - As a typical CIA pencil-pusher, Evelyn Salt was just a little too resourceful (and too damage-proof) for my liking.<br/><br/>It really killed me when Ev amazingly whipped up (in record time) a powerful, makeshift bazooka/flame-thrower which greatly helped her escape from a high security government building (barefooted, no less!).<br/><br/>Another killer-diller moment in ""Salt"" was when Ev, showing her amazing ""superpower"" potential and agility, managed to jump, from floor to floor, down the inside of an elevator shaft. (Phew! When the CIA trained its agents, they didn't kid around!) <br/><br/>Filled to overflowing with asinine situations, fluky flaws, and plot-holes galore, this $110 million production (for which AJ was paid $20 million) was originally intended to be a Tom Cruise vehicle. (Like, can you frickin' imagine that!?) <br/><br/>Out of nearly 200,000 votes on IMDb, this film has only managed to peak with an average rating of 6 stars out of 10.<br/><br/>What more can I say?....

","After watching Angelina Jolie in the 'lara Croft' films I felt she was more than capable of portraying a tough CIA agent, but after watching 'Salt' I was extremely disappointed in the film. To Jolie's credit it wasn't so much her fault as it was the writer's.The film became gradually more and more ridiculous to the point where Jolie slips past US Secret Service looking as a transvestite (I mean seriously, a blind man would have thought Jolie looked suspicious). A double agent embedded in the CIA is an acceptable plot, but turning Jolie into an unstoppable killing machine...... One of the most ridiculous parts of the film occurs at the climax when Jolie is able to incapacitate/kill dozens of secret service agents mainly with her bare hands.How on earth a 55kg woman can do that against a group of agents with a high level of tactical training is beyond me. More importantly, Why do none of them shoot her instead of trying to fight hand to hand? dumbfounding. To those of you thinking this is similar to the 'Bourne' series, its not.

The approach, like everything Lady Pit does, all is superficial and based on actresses good looks. She not only fails miserably here, she even shows a signs of bulimia. CIA looked like a pushover. None of this stuff is remotely real and you can't feel the bond between the character and everyone else. Pit's wife tried to act like she was for real here, and everything went into chaos. Turns out, everyone knows each other from when they shared a diaper. Lame and totally stupid movie, makes Angelina look worse than she already is. I loved her movies back when she played nerdy, sexy, programmer and was in tune with youth needs.

I mean the just the espionage alone is cool and all, but if you had an emotional attachment, or some sort of relation to some of the characters - well that would be interesting to say the least.

So what is Salt going to do to prove her innocence? She runs. You hear that right, she runs away from cops and her fellow colleagues including Ted Winter (Liev Schreiber) and William Peabody (Chiwetel Ejiofor) in addition to the boggling fact that she is being 'activated' to assassinate the President of Russia. But her priority on hand is to look for her missing arachnologist husband. Thus begin the continuous action pieces that will make any respectable action star proud and for this reason alone, you might chose to forgive Kurt Wimmer's implausible writing.<br/><br/>Eerily similar to ""The Bourne Identity"" franchise, ""Salt"" relies heavily on its high-octane action sets although discarding any good narrative treatment seen in the former. Its Bourne + that Bond from MGM meets The Fugitive meet the combination of Tomb Raider and Mission Impossible. But this is what you get if you hire Kurt Wimmer for the gig, the latter who came up with ""Ultraviolet"" and last year, ""Law Abiding Citizen"" is not renowned for any subtly or hefty Tom Clancy's sort of conspiracies. Instead what you get is an undercover brainwashed operation initiate by the Russia to send their agents to penetrate the soil of the United States so as to await orders to strike at the right time.<br/><br/>As a customised star vehicle for Jolie (for the record ""Salt"" was initially offered but turned down by Tom Cruise who found it too much akin to his Mission Impossible series and subsequently the role was rewritten to fit Jolie) and a product for the summer blockbuster slate, ""Salt"" definitely fits the bill. Director Phillip Noyce who returns to the studio arena after a number of years helming independent flicks proved he is still an adept hand in crafting a big-budgeted Hollywood summer flick. The old-school Australian helmer who is renowned for his political-charged action thrillers, ""Patriot Games"" and ""Clear and Present Danger"" delivers the goods at ease and with the help of stunt choreographer Simon Crane and veteran editor Stuart Baird, the collision and explosion gets bigger with each setup not forgetting the dizzy, frenetic editing. Smoke bomb, a DIY bazooka and even a pair of undies is utilized by Salt to make her exit. The props department should deserve some credit at the next Academy Awards for the latter.<br/><br/>The main star herself, Angelina Jolie was listed on IMDb for performing most of her own stunts. Watching her leaping from the roofs of moving vehicles, jumping from train, riding furiously on a stolen bike and dangling in an elevator shaft, at least you know the lady is worth every damn nickel on her million dollars paycheck. This is a star movie that practically sells on Jolie's charisma and face alone (just look at the poster for proof) and it works big time. Liev Schreiber and Chiwetel Ejiofor both respectively good actors are left on the sideline with the occasional bickering scenes that doesn't actually require an ounce of acting muscle from the duo.<br/><br/>Despite a half-baked espionage plot that involves the what, Cold War? What's that for the younger generation? And a story that twists and turns without much of a satisfactory conclusion, the movie succeeds with its flawless chase sequences, marathon stuntwork and a gutsy leading lady. DC comics, you know who you should call for a Wonder Woman."
"blacklist-1","8","2","8","24 August 2010"," Enjoyable summer action blockbuster with more than enough salt for the taste buds
","Angelina Jolie in the trailer speaking the line ""You think everyone is who they say they are"" sets the premise surrounding the mystery of ""Who is Salt?"" <br/><br/>The basic story is that Jolie plays a CIA agent Evelyn Salt who is happily married to her husband a German arachnologist. During work she ends up talking to a Russian who accuses her of being a spy and her colleague Ted Winter (a part played superbly by the reliable Liev Schreiber) and Peabody (Chiwetel Ejiofor) have to track her down. Meanwhile her husband goes missing as she tries to find him. <br/><br/>Salt is a terrific film in a lot of ways. Jolie carries the part well. Just like most of her other movies when they are action like Tombraider etc, she does all her own stunts which are terrific and add an air of authenticity to the film without the use of CGI. Her acting is good as she also looks great visually and in a few flashbacks of her character being with her husband, you feel the emotional connection of caring about them as I felt the love between them. The action sequences themselves were choreographed well and was exciting.<br/><br/>One other aspect I will say is the choice of director Phillip Noyce of keeping the allegiance of Salt in the dark was refreshing and made me think what side she was on. This kept you guessing. I figured it out about halfway through, but it is challenging as there are an initial few twists and turns that happen fast so you might be thrown off balance in trying to figure out who she is. With the film keeping you guessing keeps up the suspense and tension of what Salt will or will not do next. Some reviewers have complained that it is impossible to root for any characters like Salt in the movie making you not care about them, but as I said I think it makes it challenging for you to figure and actually engages the viewer.<br/><br/>As to far as the story a lot of people have poked plot holes in it. This may be true but to be honest with you I wasn't paying much attention. It seems to make sense to me, but maybe I'm not as smart as some people, but I really enjoyed it anyway for what it was.<br/><br/>A lot of people have also said the ending is a cop out but I think it sets it up nicely for a sequel, like a continuation of her journey. I look forward to the sequel if there is one and hope there will be more depth to Salt as a character as I thought the film could have been extended by another five to ten minutes with maybe some more flashbacks of her character. However my taste buds are already tingling for a Salty, hopefully Saltier sequel."

","Because cows milked in this movie are not only dead, but buried and decomposed and fossilized and used as an oil to power semi trucks your audience used to go watch this sh.t. For god sake i know its 8 years old movie, and i watched it just now because everyone told me that it is bad but still i am shocked how actually bad is, Its offending to audience really. Like some illiterate redneck came out of his bunker first time after cold war and made a movie about his thoughts and fantasies. It would take too long to list even half of whats wrong with this film. That amount of prejudice and black and white portraying of nations i think wasnt seen since worst cold war days. On other side, Angelina is freaking anorexic and looks seriously ill here, whose idea was to choose her to play superwoman female Rambo? She looks that skinny that i swear she is not even sexy at any point during the movie, while she throws 100kg agents around she looks like last stadium HIV patient. You should have offered her help at the time not pay her to jump around like everything is ok, while millions of teenage girl are looking at her thinking this is how sexy looks. 
There are more holes in this movies plot then in Swiss cheese. Even special effects look terrible. Just remember that weightless jumping down the elevator like trough space with no gravity. Her being handcuffed behind her back with freaking 2m chain that she can do that jumping rope exercise with.... the most secured place in the world like US president bunker has walls that can be dug trough in 5 seconds with door opening switch inside.... and etc and etc. 
This movie deserves easy 0 in all fields and guys who made it should be embarrassed of themselves, and dear fellow Americans you should all feel embarrassed that your own movie industry see you as dumb paranoid idiots that can swallow just about anything they throw in front of you, even the 50 year old fears as fresh ones. I am embarrassed too that i spent my time watching this crap but sometimes you just cant stop it, you need to watch more and see how far they can go, and they went very far this time. Disgusting movie."

","This movie is very confusing and you need to pay attention closely. No one is who they say they are which makes this an entertaining film. The story is about a woman who works for the CIA who is accused of being a Russian spy by a man who comes into CIA headquarters informing them of a possible assassination attempt against the Russian president. This makes Salt go on the run as she wants to clear her name but naturally there are plenty of surprises.Lots of action in this movie done by Angelina Jolie and she's very convincing. I was a little surprised about what happened in the movie as I came in expecting something completely different. The movie ends with a cliffhanger which shows the director and writer is very confident there will be a sequel to this movie which I will definitely watch"
"Jackpollins","9","2","9","25 July 2010"," An excellent movie..until the end
","Salt stars Angelina Jolie as Evelyn Salt, a woman on the run after being fingered as a Russian spy. The film then turns into an action chase thriller that turns out to be surprisingly excellent..until the end. I won't give away the ending to you, but I will say while it sets up for a sequel which I will certainly see, it does it in the dullest, blandest, most random & stupid way. That said, I'm still recommending the film for what it is. Jolie is good as an action star, which she didn't get to prove in the Lara Croft films because those were terrible. Liev Schreiber plays Ted Winter, a fellow agent who has to decide between his personal interests with Salt & the fact that he has to catch her. It's all done in such a loopy, fun way, that the ending doesn't seem to matter. The film also does a good job of leaving mixed signals for the audience so you can decide for yourself the real question: Who Is Evelyn Salt? The film has a lot of good twists. Right when you think you know what's going to happen, the film throws another twist at you. Overall, Salt works because of the good action and good performances by the cast. To call it a masterpiece would be a little steep, but it is an excellent & fun time at the movies."

Yet even with these flaws the story is entertaining enough to be worth the $7.50 i paid to get in.<br/><br/>Now by all means this movie isn't GREAT as by my standards a 8/10 is easy to come by, but its still entertaining and worth the watch."

"SnoopyStyle","7","1","3","23 September 2013"," Great action, convoluted story, to be continued
","Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie) is a CIA agent and her boss is Ted Winter (Liev Schreiber). Suddenly she is suspected of being a double agent who will assassinate the President of Russia.<br/><br/>It has a 'No Way Out' feel to the beginning and turn to some Jason Bourne stuff. The plot is convoluted full of double dealing double agents. The fact that we don't know Salt's loyalties and history at the start makes it hard to root for her. It's best not to be too concern about the plot, and just enjoy the action. The ending finishes with an obvious nod to a sequel. In fact it doesn't really end which dilutes the power of the climax. The climax is already too stretched out with a big pause where a lot of explaining is done. The to-be-continued ending doesn't help."
"Leofwine_draca","7","1","3","26 July 2013"," A passable slice of entertainment
","SALT is a modern-day Hollywood spy thriller with a plot as preposterous as they come: Angelina Jolie plays Evelyn Salt, a CIA agent who's falsely accused of being a Russian spy and is forced to go on the run from her former colleagues. It's one of those movies whose plot involves layering twist upon twist, identity upon identity, so that come the ending even the most steadfast viewers will be scratching their heads in puzzlement.<br/><br/>The movie proves to be fitfully entertaining, thanks to a lightning-fast pace that has no time for extraneous sub-plots or dreaded romance. It's focused and fluid, bringing a lot of energy in and keeping the momentum until the climax. The whole thing is indebted to the BOURNE series, of course, but there's no harm in that; if you're going to imitate something, then you might as well imitate the best.<br/><br/>The direction is lacklustre, though, which is a surprise given Aussie director Phillip Noyce's pedigree. This is the guy who brought us the excellent suspense flick DEAD CALM, after all, along with two decent spy thrillers in the form of the Harrison Ford/Jack Ryan movies. The dialogue scenes are fine, but Noyce mishandles the action. Most attempts to emulate Paul Greengrass's cinematography end in disaster, and this film is no exception.<br/><br/>Angelina Jolie, stick-figure thin and supposedly an expert fighter, is also miscast. Something strange has been happening to Jolie over the years; she was never a great actress, but she looked the part in the likes of the TOMB RAIDER films. Nowadays her extreme weight loss sits at odds with the physicality of the roles she plays and renders the fight scenes ridiculous. Liev Schreiber must be pretty bored playing another in a long line of similar roles, but look out for an excellent Chiwetel Ejiofor as the dogged cop on Jolie's trail."
"h-blin83","7","1","3","2 March 2012"," Good action
","Many reviewers here have stated that this movie isn't realistic because 'Salt doesn't get bruised enough' or 'no one her size could...' Have these people ever been to an action movie before? NO ACTION MOVIE IS REALISTIC. They are all written to be over-the-top because that's what makes them entertaining. We suspend disbelief to enter the world of the action-hero (or heroine) and we go along for the thrilling ride that is sometimes so over-the-top it's ridiculous! But that's what makes it fun. If action movies were realistic, they would be slow and boring. This movie does not cross the line anymore than any other action movie.<br/><br/>Salt delivers exactly what is promised -- a solid 100 minutes of action. It keeps you watching, it keeps you guessing (even when it turns out you were right in some cases), and it entertains from start to finish. If you like the action movie genre, chances are you will enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>As for the reviewers who criticized the way Russians are portrayed, the action genre plays to comic book-like caricatures. The villains are no more realistic than the heroine! This isn't a documentary! If you like action movies, give Salt a go. Angelina won't disappoint."

"tomgillespie2002","7","1","3","6 September 2011"," Surprisingly effective action film
","Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie) is happily married to spider expert Michael Krause (August Diehl) and is working for the CIA. When a mysterious Russian is picked up named Orlov (Daniel Olbrychski), Salt interrogates him and he names her as being an undercover Russian spy. Salt's friend and co-worker Ted Winter (Liev Schreiber) is sceptical but Peabody (Chiwetel Ejiofor) wants to detain her and question her. Salt manages to escape the building and goes on the run with the two in pursuit. As Salt flees her pursuers, and leaves carnage in her path, Winter and Peabody gradually learn more of Salt's past and must protect the visiting Russian President who they believe Salt has been sent to assassinate.<br/><br/>Action films are generally quite boring. They are very limited in terms of storyline and are always running the risk of doing something that has been done a million times before. The 'new wave' of action films such as the excellent Jason Bourne films, and even the James Bond re-boot have managed to combine generic action characteristics with a certain grit, and therefore injecting new life into the genre. Salt manages to achieve this not in it's action scenes, but in the fact that the main character just may be a bad guy. It's like the revelation in No Way Out but played out with explosions, hand-to-hand combat, and surprisingly violent deaths.<br/><br/>Okay, f**k it, Salt is a Russian spy. It's revealed early on so I'm not really ruining much. This fact just makes the whole film better. She isn't fighting to protect the innocent, she is fighting in order to ignite a potentially catastrophic war between Russia and the U.S., killing the Presidents of both countries along the way. I was so surprised and delighted with this brave decision that I found myself rooting for Salt, and wanting to achieve her goal. The action scenes themselves are as well choreographed and filmed as you would hope, in that shaky hand-held Bourne vein. A lot of people have complained about it, but I like it - I want to feel the pace and confusion of a fight and I feel it helps place you there. And for a 12-rated film, I was shocked to see Salt smash a bottle on a table and then repeatedly stab someone in the neck with it. Again, delighted.<br/><br/>Yes, it is far-fetched and a tad silly, but it's a bloody action film. Character actors Schreiber and Ejiofor are always reliable and are great in their scenes, and Diehl (of Inglorious Basterds fame) catches the eye in what is a relatively small role. Even though it does fly off the handle in the last twenty minutes or so, this is a solid little action film, and was a genuine surprise given I was expecting a generic and average shoot 'em up. It's also nice to see director Noyce back on track, given the debacle that was The Bone Collector and The Saint.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"

","*May contain spoilers* This just happened to be on one day, so I watched it AND am pleasantly surprised at how riveting a film it is. The pacing is perfect, the plot develops naturally, nothing about this film feels contrived. The only part that is a bit ""out there"" is Salt jumping down the elevator shaft and not getting injured. There are surprises that I honestly didn't see coming. I truly felt like I was watching a Bourne movie- so much action and intensity in acting. Jolie did an excellent job providing depth for Salt. Liev is great, solid acting as usual. If you like action flicks, this one is for you. If you like mysteries, this one is also for you. If you like Angelina, this ones for you- and you get the idea! I'd be up for a sequel and believe you me, sequels usually aren't that great, BUT every once in a while a sequel ends up being better than the original. I'd definitely like to see more of Salt!"

","I remember when this one came out it got a lot of very mixed reviews. It has finally made it to the small screen and so I thought I'd have a look. It's certainly not as bad as some have said, but equally, it's not all that great either. I think it suffers from what I call the 'Bourne Effect', in that the 'Bourne' films are a pretty hard act to follow and just about every film of that ilk since has failed to hit the mark. Don't get me wrong, it's perfectly watchable but it just falls a bit short of the mark at those all important moments. Here's a brief summary.<br/><br/>Evelyn Salt is a CIA agent who is accused by a defector, known as Orlov, of being a Russian spy. She immediately goes on the run trying to get to he husband, Mike, who she believes is in danger. The defector also said that she would assassinate the Russian President at a funeral in New York. Her boss, Ted Winter, and the head of another department, Peabody, are in charge of tracking her down but she gives them the slip more than once. She has a plan and in order to carry it out she may have to compromise herself. I'm not going to say any more because I don't want a sniper picking me off while I'm eating a sandwich.<br/><br/>First of all I must say all of the stunt work on this film was first rate, I really enjoyed this aspect of the film very much. Performance wise, I thought Angelina Jolie did a great job as Evelyn Salt, considering the part was originally written for a male (Tom Cruise), I thought she was excellent. Liev Schreiber did a good job as Ted Winter, as did Chiwetel Ejiofor as Peabody and Daniel Olbrychski as Orlov.<br/><br/>There are many twists and turns in the plot and, of course, a big twist at the end that I'm afraid I saw coming from a mile off (sorry, no spoilers today). There were a couple of moments where the film did fall a little flat, but the pace was pretty much kept at a fairly high level throughout. I guess where it fails, in comparison with the 'Bourne' films, is that the plot just isn't quite clever enough to give it the edge it needed. But as I said earlier, it's perfectly watchable and suitably entertaining. I also like the fact that it has a female lead that is believable, so many of these films fail in that respect too. So, over all, great action sequences, a believable heroine and quite entertaining, if slightly flawed Still though, recommended.<br/><br/>My Score: 6.5/10"
"perkypops","8","1","3","24 June 2011"," A top notch spy thriller
","Look for them and you'll find the flaws but this spy thriller has Angeline Jolie showing how good an actress she is in keeping us guessing which side she is on. The acting is excellent throughout.<br/><br/>The opening scenes sets out the story the clearly for us with Evelyn Salt (Jolie) being tortured and then released in an exchange between the US and North Korea set up by her husband Mike. Pan forward two years and we find Ev and Mike in marital bliss when a Russian defector walks into Ev's CIA office out of the blue. Ev interviews him and within a few minutes everyone is asking who she is. A plot has been uncovered which suggests Ev is about to assassinate the Russian president. Whose side is she on? As in the ""Changeling"" Jolie plays a doubted woman exceedingly well, and there is some well crafted subtlety in this performance too, as Ev tries very hard to contact her husband whilst the plot unfolds.<br/><br/>The set pieces are well executed, the plot twists cleverly worked, and even the predictable sometimes working as quite unpredictable. This isn't another ""Bourne"" movie but at times it does show similarities with the genre.<br/><br/>If you enjoy spy movies see this film. Eight out of ten."

","I can accept any premise to a movie. What I expect is for the plot to unfold in a plausible way based on that premise. This movie succeeds in that respect. Agent Salt deals with every situation in her own way, bearing in mind she is a highly trained killing machine. People complain the Russians are pictured in a bad light in this movie. Duh, they're meant to be the bad guys people! Finally, as an action movie, SALT sure delivers. The pace is fast, but slows down at the right moments to let people catch their breath. Add a few unexpected twists (but still plausible based on the premise that the Soviet Union has infiltrated every echelon of the US security administration with sleeper agents) and this movie is very entertaining. Acting is reasonable, not that it matters for such action movies anyway."

The storyline is a bit worn however Jolie and the supporting cast do their job well to produce a watchable film. Set in the American Capitol an in-deep Russian Agent is simmering for her chance of revenge. On whom I will not say.

","I thought this movie was amazing, but there is one thing I didn't understand. Salt faked the murder of the Russian president, and killed the Russian that she was working for. Why did she go along with the plan to kill the American president/ gain control of the country's nuclear weapons if her intent wasn't to harm anyone? She didn't know that her CIA partner was also a Russian spy, so she wouldn't have known to stop him in the first place. So I guess my question is why did Salt go the the President's bunker under the White House if she wasn't planning on going along with the Russian's plan? Other than this one thing the movie was excellent. It had many plot twists and kept me hanging the entire time. It wasn't like one of the overdone, cliché spy movies that continue to be made. I give it five stars, out of five. If you the answer to my question about the movie please answer it for me."

","Recap: Evelyn Salt is a young CIA-agent working in the ""Russia House"" a department with focus on events and people in Russia. And she is late for home and her anniversary. That moment, Orlov, a Russian agent steps inside her office and claims a Russian agent will kill the Russian president in New York in a couple of days. And that agent will be Evelyn Salt. Suddenly she is the most sought after fugitive in the entire country, but she is involved in a game with much higher stakes than her own life <br/><br/>Comments: Actually, they are quite rare, the really good agent action-thrillers. But Salt is one, and Angelina Jolie is a star talented enough to handle and carry a movie like this. She and the movie got all the ingredients. First and foremost a good and deep enough story. I wouldn't call it complex, but with enough layers that gives it room to evolve and give it weight. Secondly it got all the high adrenaline shots such a movie needs. Car chases, explosions, gun fights. You name it, you got it. And it doesn't dilute it with an half hearted attempt at comedy.<br/><br/>In my opinion, given a good enough continuing story preferably in the hands of Wimmer whom has delivered solid action movies time and again, has the possibility to become a new agent franchise. This could well be the first movie in a series, it has established a solid foundation for it anyway.<br/><br/>That Jolie excels is not a surprise really, but she got good support as well. Both Schreiber and Ejiofor are solid actors, especially Ejiofor is one of the more underrated in Hollywood. His role was limited in Salt, but could very well be expanded in an eventual sequel.<br/><br/>This was one of the better in the genre recently, entertaining all the way through. I can only hope that they see the opportunity and recognize what they have in Salt.<br/><br/>8/10"
"TonyHurtado","7","1","3","28 January 2011"," Salt, is great like pepper.
","Another great Summer blockbuster. The funny thing about this movie is that this movie came out during when the whole Russian Spy's in America were captured in real life. Anyways besides that funny fact, this movie was simply awesome. It was truly Jolie's comeback, even though she really didn't take a break from acting, I'm just saying it is her comeback to a leading role in an action flick. The movies focus was on the feud and history between Russia and America, which is a topic people still talk about. It is one of those movies that sort of explains how Russia feels about America. It also deals with nuclear power, and what would go on in a situation of that power.<br/><br/>It is quite a confusing movie, but you start to understand as the movie progresses. This movie is a type of movie where you think one thing is going to happen but something else occurs. It is also in a certain way a who done type deal. The characters can also confuse you. The one character that you don't know what they are thinking is definitely Jolie's character. You can't tell whether she is a spy or not, she does one thing that makes her seem evil, but then it turns into a good thing.<br/><br/>This movie reminded me a whole lot like the Bourne movies because of the action and suspense and a mix of the actual feud between America and Russians. Anyways 4 out of 5 stars for this summer blockbuster."

","This is my first review for IMDb, as I felt compelled to do so after reading some of the .... reviews it received.<br/><br/>It contains everything you could want from a film, excellent acting, a good plot, twists & turns and a large production. Yes, at some points it could be perceived as non realistic, but people have to remember this is a FILM! Not real life, I don't remember reading such harsh reviews for Laura Croft or Mission Impossible, perhaps everything that happened in those films are realistic? Why can't people watch a film without criticizing every single aspect of it. I agree on one or two occasions watching this film, you will think ""OK, that couldn't happen"" One example would be ""Salt's"" disguise to enter the white house, but that's the only flaw I could find in the film. Why are people criticizing this film because apparently it reflects Russians as ""Idiots"", once again it's a film! Just as many other films in the past have used other countries as the protagonist.<br/><br/>If your looking for an entertaining action film, filled with twists and turns, superb acting and you have the ability to look outside of the box, realising this is just a film and not a historical documentary then this is the film for you! I personally am looking forward to a Salt 2, as the film seemed to end opening the doors to a second one, lets hope!"

","A far- fetched, but action packed, knockabout spy yarn that defies rational analysis but is entertaining enough. Angelina Jolie stars as Salt, the CIA operative who is ostensibly outed by a Russian defector. What follows is an increasingly preposterous series of stunts and plot developments saved by some very good action scenes.<br/><br/>Director Phillip Noyce knows his way around the spy/action genre through the Tom Clancy conceived Patriot Games and Clear and Present Danger, and also The Saint. The opening scene has a suitably lascivious shot of Salt being tortured in her underwear. Thereafter she dispatches America's and Russia's finest with ease.<br/><br/>The Russian stereotypes are lazy, and the sacrifice of realism for action ludicrous. Yet it is all well done, the story zips along going from one set-piece action sequence to the next. Jolie struggles with the script, a small part of it is trying to be a bona fide spy yarn, but for the rest she is Lara Croft, a fantasy indestructible Amazon.<br/><br/>Not to be taken too seriously."
"arman_k66","5","1","3","20 January 2011"," An unrealistic but entertaining cliché action movie
","However most action movies are not so realistic, this movie which at the beginning sounded promising to me, progressed so unrealistically and predictably that in my opinion, can not be ranked as a good action movie.<br/><br/>Angelina Jolie as the chief character of the movie, plays the role of a dauntless invincible agent, who bears a grudge against soviet undercover spies who kill her husband and this ends to a heroic, audacious mission to eliminate all those spies individually and independently. The plot of raising spies and training them since their childhood to conduct missions on the territory of another country, sounded intriguing to me. But the way the rest of the movie progressed, was trite and disappointing.<br/><br/>In this movie, in many sequences, audience is considered too simple-minded and naive. Unbelievable loose security of white house which made it too easy too breach, killing all Russian highly trained spies, managing to escape from a highly secured building with dozens of agents inside, launching the nuclear warhead solely by the president and without presence of chief generals of United States, all sounded too simple, unreasonable and unreal. In addition, the selection of roles was weak in some cases especially about the president of the US who looked like everyone except a president! On the bright side, the movie is full of exciting and entertaining sequences and thrills the audience occasionally.<br/><br/>All in all it was not too much promising and I did not enjoyed watching this movie as much as I expected since it abound with unreasonable and unrealistic events."
"TxMike","Null","1","3","2 January 2011"," Angelena Jolie as Evelyn Salt, in a female equivalent of a Jason Bourne role.
","We watched this on DVD (theatrical version) with Emily, who had seen this movie a couple of times already. But she noted that certain key points in the movie were different, including the ending. After reading a bit, it seems that there are at least three versions of this movie, ""Salt.""<br/><br/>The movie opens ""two years earlier"" in a prisoner exchange with N. Korea, where they had been torturing Angelina Jolie as Evelyn Salt, to get her to admit to her role as a spy, but she insisted that they were wrong. Out, and back in the USA, we see her working for the CIA. Then, as she is about to leave work to go celebrate her anniversary, a Russian comes in and says he knows about a plot to kill the Russian president on an upcoming visit, and further that there are quite a number of Russian spies implanted in the USA culture, living as Americans but planning an eventual destruction of the USA.<br/><br/>Then he says the spy's name is ""Salt. Evelyn Salt."" That gets her on the run, a journey which doesn't end for the entire movie.<br/><br/>I like Jolie as an action hero. Jason Bourne has nothing on Evelyn Salt, and we see her get out of some very sticky situations. The topic is current, as during the past year some Russian spies living here had been discovered, and deported. The extent of the story presented in this movie is very far-fetched, but makes for good entertainment.<br/><br/>July 2019 edit: We watched it again after 8 years, this time on the BluRay version I bought a while back, again it comes across as a highly improbable but exciting and entertaining caper.<br/><br/>SPOILERS FOLLOW: As we see Salt run we wonder if she really is a spy planning to kill the US President. But we also see she never kills people, only wounds or disables them. Until she comes upon the Russian spy hideout, where she kills all that are there. So we figure she really is a Russian spy, implanted for a long time, but she has come to realize their mission is not a good one, and now she is doing what she can to stop it. In the climax of the movie the POTUS is in an underground safe place, guarded by trusted Liev Schreiber as Ted Winter, but he turns out to be a traitor. He is trying to start a nuclear war, with Iran and Israel as prime targets, and she has to stop the launch sequence. In the end, still not knowing for sure what she is, she is allowed to escape by jumping out of a helicopter into a lake, and as the movie ends we see her running through the woods. This sets up a sequel, as she had explained that there are lots more embedded Russian spies."

OK contra: Its a Hollywood film, with that I mean is that not everything is very realistic and quiet stereotype.

"phoenix_100","7","1","3","29 December 2010"," Review of Salt - 2010.
","Salt, like many reviewers have commented, is fast paced, full of action, and without much plot. The film immediately starts of with a Russian exchange of prisoners, after Salt is captured for being a spy for the Americans. After a brief scene in which Orslov is interrogated, the movie subsequently explodes, as Salt tries to escape the building and the ensuing car chase, the first of a chain of twists that keep this movie flowing.<br/><br/>Salt is rated M (PG-13) for violence. The film contains a lot of action scenes, but also some very violent scenes in which a man is constricted with a chain, another man is killed with a broken bottle - apart from the violence, the film doesn't have much profanity or any indecent. I found the movie, Salt, interesting and entertaining to watch, let down by an ending that was placed because of time constraints or the possibility of a sequel.<br/><br/>Overall, the highlights of this film include decent action scenes, and a nice accompanying score. This movie is great for entertainment, however the plot is a little shallow. Salt features enough twists to keep the movie flowing at a entertainingly fast pace. 7/10.<br/><br/>*On the complaints because of the interpretation of Russia - this film is purely fictional! I think everyone knows that this is a typical interpretation of the 'spy country' in the movies, and it's obviously a false depiction."
"bradhayashi","8","1","3","29 December 2010"," Entertaining, fun, and I hope there is a sequel
","Well, many gave this bad reviews because it was not ""realistic."" I think consumers of movies can no longer just watch a movie and be entertained. Everything has to be real to them in spite of the fact that everything that happens on the big screen is not real.<br/><br/>No, perhaps it wasn't a ""realistic"" representation of Russia. So what? Another reviewer criticized the Russian names they used for the characters that they were not authentic enough. So what? Sounded convincing enough for me.<br/><br/>I think Jolie pulled it off as a hard-edged spy. Her performance was actually quite good and I was surprised that a female lead could come off like she did in this type of role. Liev Schreiber also put on a very convincing performance as Ted Winter.<br/><br/>The plot kept you guessing until the end who was the bad guy and who was the good guy. Good twist to the plot.<br/><br/>Lots of action, there really was not a lull in moving the plot forward. It was entertaining to see how Salt kept getting out of her predicaments thinking on her feet and using creativity.<br/><br/>One reviewer criticized how ""unrealistic"" is was for her to be climbing around the outside on of a 20 story building along the window ledges. It was interesting to learn in the Special Features that she did most of the stunts and that she was actually walking the ledges in real life! (Yes, she was connected to a thin safety cable, but still...) No green screen, no CGI, she was doing if for real. So it was entertaining to read that review accusing it of being unrealistic and hokey. (Open mouth, insert foot.)<br/><br/>I was entertained and felt that I got my money's worth. I appreciated the fact that the Theatrical Cut kept more of the graphic violent scenes off-camera. If you want more blood and detailed gore, watch the Extended and/or Director's Cut.<br/><br/>I hope there is a sequel. An interesting premise has been setup for it. I recommend viewing this movie. Lots of fun."
"Spaceygirl","8","1","3","27 December 2010"," Great fun!
","Regardless of all the negative reviews, I absolutely LOVED this movie! Yes, it's mindless fun but it's a movie for goodness sake! It's supposed to be ENTERTAINING! Angelina excels in her kick-ass role, beating up and killing a ton of people without staining her pristine white shirt. Liev Schrieber, the man with the sexiest voice in Hollywood, is his usual excellent self and one of my favourite men to watch, Chiwetel Egiofor, is also good. The script is bog-standard for this type of fare and won't be winning awards any time soon. Salt is worth watching on a lazy afternoon when you can just check your brain at the door and enjoy it with a good bowl of popcorn. Hugely enjoyable."
"lewiskendell","7","1","3","27 December 2010"," Not quite Bourne with boobs, but almost.
","(This is a review of the Unrated Director's Cut of Salt. I haven't seen the original theatrical version or the Extended Cut.)<br/><br/>Salt is a fun spy/action movie. It had lots of exciting scenes, a credible action actress, and at times, it's downright thrilling. It even had me guessing at what direction it was going, at a few points. Salt is also derivative of lots of other movies. Primarily the Bourne series and the Mission Impossible movies, but also the Bond films, Tom Clancy's series, and The Manchurian Candidate. It didn't bother me much that Salt borrowed liberally from so many other films. As they say, there's nothing new under the sun. The one real issue that I did have with Salt was that the last part of the movie tries to be entirely too clever, and loses a lot of its credibility and falls apart, as a result. But, as I can't really go too much into that without spoiling the whole film, I'll just content myself to saying that while I didn't really like the turn the movie took towards the finale, it wasn't enough to ruin the movie for me.<br/><br/>I love Angelina Jolie in these kinds of roles. She's a born action star, and there are very few actresses who would have been as successful in this role as she was. She almost makes you believe that her character could beat the crap out of and outsmart every other police officer, agent, and soldier that she came across, without missing a beat. It seemed like she did most (if not all) of her own stunts and (brutal) fight scenes, and given the fact that she had just given birth to twins a few months before, I was beyond impressed. <br/><br/>The ending completely leaves itself open for sequels, and I'd love to see Jolie return for the role. All we need is a story that doesn't lose itself in shennanigans that would feel right at home in an over-the-top spy movie from the 60's, and we could have a really solid franchise on our hands."
"lovetheoutdoors_2000","9","1","3","23 December 2010"," Greatest Female Action Hero---of ANY time!
","I'm not a action movie kind of person at all, but I agree with the previous viewer stating that NO ACTION MOVIES ARE REALISTIC. It is very true. That's why I never like actions movies, the car chase, the fights and all that stuff bores me. But I have to say that Angelina has that magical and mysterious aura to her that I really enjoyed all of her action movies since Lara Croft. I think she is a really great, and actually the ONLY outstanding female action movie star who can deliver the same heavy weight ""punch"" of action like her male peers such as Bruce Willis and Mel Gibson or The Bourne Identity series. I think her action movies are much better than her dramatic roles such as the one she played a mother who lost her boy set in the 50s in Los Angeles. That really ruined it for me. But after Salt, I'm a fan again! Way to go Angie!"
"MovieLight2006","8","1","3","23 December 2010"," Salt is much better than I thought it'd be. I recommend it.
","The aspect that really made this movie work is the obvious love she has for her husband. By the time you finish watching the movie and finally know what was going on, to watch it again is to have an even greater appreciation for events and why Salt does what she does - then you start to realize how decent and well planned out the film really is. Jolie's portrayal of Salt and her ultimate ambitions really nails it for me. I must say I couldn't figure out her true motives for quite some time - a testimony to the cleverness of the plot.<br/><br/>Granted some of the things she did in some of the action sequences were a little beyond humanly possible, but being a movie you really don't mind. And quite frankly, this is becoming more the norm on action movies these days. But in spite of this she had a very human and vulnerable side which was a nice touch - especially when on the run.<br/><br/>And for those who are complaining about inaccuracy of Russia and Russians in this movie: it's a movie, not a documentary. This is a filmmaker's version of a fictional Russia and a fictional America. How easily some were able to do what they did on the American side could also annoy people who are looking at it as if it's a nonfictional documentary.<br/><br/>Schreiber was convincing in his role, as was Ejiofor. Even August Diehl as her husband worked very well IMO. Very enjoyable - one I will be watching again (and already have)."

","OH BOY! Did I enjoy this movie. It was full of action, and Angelina Jolie was superb, with good supporting cast. You need to keep your wits about you though, because if you miss a line or two, then you could get lost and wonder what is happening. Unfortunately, I am quite good at guessing 'what comes next', so it was slightly predictable. However, this did not spoil the action. Yes, some of it is slightly far-fetched. But you cannot have everything, and no film is perfect. This was the most enjoyable film I have seen this year so I would recommend it. It is cleverly constructed, and the action and stunt scenes are brilliant. Especially good is the escape scene when Angelina is being chased. Its the sort of film where you want to watch it again, because you feel sure you missed something first time around. I highly recommend this film and hope you enjoy it."

"sandra-ankarsrum","6","1","3","21 November 2010"," Angelina Jolie saves the world
","I started to watch ""Salt"" not really knowing what to except. Maybe that's why I actually liked it. The story feels a bit old, the cold war ended a long time ago, and but the action scenes makes up for that, if you like the exaggerated kind (jumping on and off trucks while still driving, walking away from anything the ""bad guys"" throw at you and still looking like a million dollars). But there are some twists and turns along the road that keeps the story going.<br/><br/>The role of Evelyn Salt is made for Jolie. Which it's really not, I think Tom Cruise was first choice and he turned it down, a good thing 'cause he's already been down that road with the Mission Impossible- movies. It's not her best acting but still it's OK and she looks the part. She's one of few actresses who can do action like this and be credible. ""Salt"" is definitely better of with Jolie than Cruise, a female Salt keeps it fresh.<br/><br/>Although the story could have benefited from being a bit more up to date (I mean the Russians - again? It's not 1989). But still, if there is a sequel I'll see it. I want to know if she gets the other moles or not (of curse she will, she's Evelyn Salt - super agent and trained by both American and Russian spy organizations)."

"Rizar","Null","1","3","3 November 2010"," Salt (2010, PG 13)
","Full of surprises and adrenaline, ""Salt"" has a dark playful side that relishes in misdirection. What it lacks in explanation, clear intentions, and realism, it makes up in novelty and clever action. The film is a spy thriller involving CIA agents and KGB spies. In this sense, it's something like a remnant of Cold War conspiracy movies. The best parts use frequent red herrings to drive the story, which is evident from the tagline: ""Who is Salt?"".<br/><br/>Action is its emphasis: fantastic car stunts, close call killings, and spectacular Houdini escapes. Angelina Jolie stars as a CIA agent, named Evelyn Salt, who we discover is an expert at interrogation and, from the looks of it, a supreme master at martial arts, stealth, and marksmanship. She's like a ninja, but the main characters usually are in Kurt Wimmer action stories (anyone remember his Gun-Kata or Gun Fu invention for ""Equilibrium"", basically a gun training dance?).<br/><br/>Suddenly she seems to question her allegiance to the CIA, but the story keeps her intentions as a sort of riddle. Her close partner is Ted Winter (Liev Schreiber), who councils her to avoid taking on desk jobs. We don't need to worry about that. After a Russian defector, Orlov (Daniel Olbrychski), walks voluntarily into the CIA headquarters and hints that Salt (Angelina Jolie) might be a Russian spy intent on killing Medvedev (the Russian president), she escapes from CIA custody. Why is she so hasty and quick to flee from counterintelligence agents? Is she allergic to sitting on the other side of the interrogation table? Is her husband in danger? And if so, from who? These questions keep you interested to figure out what's going on. She hunts for her husband and prepares for battle. The plot twists and turns through assassination attempts, sometimes aiming to provoke a war between the U.S. and Russia. Medvedev is a major target while attending a funeral in the U.S. for the vice president. Russia starts to militarize when they find out. The U.S. President is also a target, forcing him to take cover and get his nuclear strike case ready.<br/><br/>It's difficult to give details without spoiling the movie, so here are a few things it isn't (though not as criticism). It wasn't a version of Kurt Wimmer's ""Ultraviolet"", thankfully. Wimmer went back to writing after his ""Ultraviolet"" disaster, but in that job he hasn't suffered in the least, and perhaps this film will help revitalize his future prospects (it should). The director of ""Salt"", by the way, is Phillip Noyce (""The Bone Collector"", ""Clear and Present Danger"", ""Patriot Games""), but his touch for military-political intrigue shows through only slightly.<br/><br/>Military strategy isn't central to the story either. It lacks broad detail or chess strategy during its assassination plot sequences, almost treating them as cursory events in the tribulations of Evelyn Salt. You don't get any realistic sense of the U.S. President's guards reacting to the assassination attempts or the two nations (US and Russia) mobilizing forces against one another due to the threats. But they aren't the focus. It's a conspiracy duel between KGB and CIA agents. You are mainly in the position of trying to figure out a typical ""Bourne Identity"" plot.<br/><br/>Salt weaves through the intrigue. She changes disguises often and avoids any easy to tell moralistic sympathies. She's classy and serious, with time to take care of her little dog and reflect on her husband. She also flies down elevator shafts like Spider-Man. After a series of incredible car crashes, she bandages a small cut on her side when she should be lying in a hospital. But, still, her character has an interesting back story and her flashiness makes the movie enjoyable.<br/><br/>Angelina Jolie has a knack for keeping our curiosity even in the most absurd moments, perhaps best when she turns to the mysterious and dark side. Initially Tom Cruise was asked to play the lead role, but he turned it down, fearing it was too similar to ""Mission: Impossible"". The locations were shot in New York and Washington, DC on a budget of $130 million. The ending has an obvious contradiction in the dialog pretty much (revealing it would require a spoiler), but in a ludicrous action-thriller written this well, it isn't even annoying."
"mysteryfan04","7","1","3","1 November 2010"," Tense and Exciting, But Uneven
","At a first glance, Salt may seem like another run-of-the-mill action thriller. However, it is much more than that. Angelina Jolie plays Evelyn Salt, an agent of the CIA who is outed for being a Russian spy out to kill the U.S. president. The movie features Oscar-worthy sound effects and some surprisingly tense scenes. Jolie delivers one of the most sizzling performances of the year as a woman dedicated to her husband and job but holding many intriguing secrets. Her performance and the script prevent the film from being anything resembling a completely boring slog. There are still some flaws with the film. Action sequences involving trucks and buildings border on implausible, and the ending feels very forced, predictable, and uneven. Plot twists can be predictable and overwhelming. Overall, Salt is a multifaceted story that is well-acted and reasonably entertaining."

","I really don't believe one should look for logic or credibility in SALT, a film with an incredible pace and with enough twists and turns to easily screw the viewer's mind off, but luckily and successfully I kept attached to the whirling scenes of gunfire, car chases, explosions and gung-ho fighting. Angelina Jolie plays a straight-faced, ice-cold, uber- professional secret agent who's a wild horse struck by accusations of being a Russian mole - which she is. Or is she? Whatever you may crave from this one the film seems to take an alternate turn on the dramatics, and although there are clichés that comes on a string, it didn't tire me out because I knew that the film would just as soon as being knocked down, rise to its feet and continue relentlessly. Many people find mindless action-thrillers to be stupid, but one can't claim so when the film seems fully aware of being so itself."

"nEoFILM","5","1","4","31 October 2011"," Disappointing 80's retread...
","Salt. The trailer looked rubbish, dated and starring Angelina Jolie, was never going to tickle my fancy. Reminding me of Rodger Donaldson's, Kevin Costner starrer, No Way Out, I felt that the attempt may be to bring that 80′s thriller to a new audience but instead we got a very confused tome. Firstly, I will cover the good points, which start with the script.<br/><br/>Though heavily flawed and mired by poor dialogue, pacing and a schizophrenic narrative, it was clearly intelligently conceived and several neat twists, though generally predictable, had survived. And besides the music, that's about it. In the end, this is a film with little identity, seeking to confuse the audience and bring them into the complex world of double agents and apocalyptic doomsday scenarios.<br/><br/>The story begins with Evelyn Salt, who after being released from a Korean prison and being brutally integrated as a spy, married her ""Cover"" husband who we believe she actually loves, in spite of the fact that he is being used as the aforementioned ""cover"". Then, 2 years later, she is brought into interrogate a Russian defector who tells her that she is a sleeper agent whose mission it to kill the Russian Premier, which she vehemently denies and goes on the run to prove her innocence and protect her husband <br/><br/>Sounds pretty straight forward so far But after about half an hour, everything shifts as she assassinates the Russian President, dons a Russian hat, meets up with the defector and watches her husband drown before her eyes to prove her loyalty to her brethren of sleeper agents. Then, she murders ALL of them! She meets up with another sleeper, breaks into the White House, blows part of it up and ends up in a room with a ""master agent"", a key player from earlier in the film and completely predictable twist, with a dead U.S. President and a nuclear countdown ticking <br/><br/>The main problem with this isn't the outlandish plotting but the fact that we never really know who Salt is. She starts out as a normal CIA agent, who is then placed under suspicion of being a Russian sleeper, then she 's on the run and until this point were satisfied that she's being set up, but then she is not only guilty, thereby destroying all the character development of the first act, she's a VERY guilty and clearly a bad guy.<br/><br/>Then she is forced to watch her husband die to prove her loyalty, only to promptly kill those who murdered him, so really, what was then point? This was a man whom she was wanting to save at all costs in the opening 30 minutes but when she finds him he's left to die.<br/><br/>Then she commits an outlandish assassination of the Russian Premier, or does she? But by the time she's making her way into the preposterously defended nuclear bunker, I simply don't like her, or really understand what the hell she's playing at? And without the empathy for the titular character, there's little going for the film.<br/><br/>This is an ambitious project but fails to engage with me, as Jolie is a truly terrible leading lady in my opinion, and casting her in such a duplicitous role was a mistake. Even if a character changes allegiances, we still know who they are but this is not the case here as Salt seems to have a split personality with little explanation.<br/><br/>And the final point must be that if Russia had trained a band of sleeper agents this skilled, this lethal that they could not only infiltrate the U.S., but fight their way into the heart of the White House's Nuclear Bunker, I believe that the Cold War would have heated up a long time ago and that we'd all be speaking Russian too!<br/><br/>A real shame that what could have been a pretty effective Cold War thriller was allowed to descend into an unpleasant and non-empathetic watch."

When I saw the revised version I was disappointed because I felt why change perfection to mediocre? It would have not made the movie that much longer and made every piece of the movie fit better together. When her husband was murdered before her and the president's scene was disappointing due to the president's scene especially, their mission was to kill him and instead he gets a bop on the head with a gun???!!! And when she witnesses the murder of her husband in the director's cut it showed how well trained she was when in the released version it threw me off a bit.

","I was truly amazed by this movie. It riveted me to my chair and made me not to want to leave till I saw the whole thing. I found the acting quite excellent, particularly by Angelina Jolie. It was the plot that truly amazed me. I am one of those people who want to see something different than the same old tried and true movie plots, perhaps the most common being the LA Detective who works with the LA prostitute. Cute maybe - the first many times you see that, and boring at some point. The plot here, which I will not give is more than action. It is an interesting premise that I found quite interesting. After a while in this movie I was really wondering who was who and who was on what side. So for my tastes, a great plot meets great acting. That is by itself a very great start.<br/><br/>But adding to that is action, action and more action. To be sure, some of it was let me say ... amazing which might imply above normal belief, but of course that much is Hollywood. Without some amazing things, perhaps we would think movies did not do enough for us. I saw the action as adding quite nicely to the comments I made about a great plot and also exceptional acting. So for me, this was by far one of the better movies of its type that I have seen in a long time. I hope others enjoy it as well."

","It is interesting that Angelina Jolie who is about as attractive as a woman can be is totally an action hero in this one. They aim here is to make her a female James Bond. While the action is no doubt at 007 level, when you cut out the sex part of Bond you lose something. I mean, physically it is more possible for a woman to do bedroom exercises than it is the male. <br/><br/>Instead we get Evelyn Salt whose ready to kill and watch her husband be killed, all for her own purpose or cause. The movie keeps you guessing where salt is going to wind up. <br/><br/>It is well filmed with a reduction of blue screens because Jolie is not afraid of heights and is more than willing to dangle 12 stories up. This is great and gives the movie more of a real action look. But darn it, I'd want to see some guys score and female Bond (Salt) and that just isn't addressed at all.<br/><br/>Salt's name is named after the Nixon/Carter etc Missile treaties with Russia which this movie does have a cold war type of theme that even brings the Middle East into it.

Yes this movie has plot holes as all fictional spy movies do, but it has fewer of them and they are easy to just take in and enjoy. The three main characters in this movie are all entertaining especially Jolie. The action sequences are first rate and of course over the top but that is part of the fun.

Damn. I guess this means she'll shop around for another breakout vehicle, which means we'll be tortured one more time. Jolie, who is fast becoming the Liz Taylor of her generation with multiple babies substituting multiple husbands, is resting on her IRL fame. I get that this is an action flick and not a documentary, but it is simply not believable that a 95 lb woman can outfight about 50 two hundred pound trained bruisers, not to mention outwit the combined intelligence agencies of the USSR, Russia, and the US, oh wait, maybe that part could be believable, given the US president's wooden dialogue and plot holes large enough to accommodate several ICBMs. It's good for a laugh, I suppose, and some credit should be given to Jolie for performing without showing us once even one inch of cleavage (she clearly used a body double in the opening scenes in the North Korean prison, where all prisoners are apparently forced to wear Victoria's Secret naughty things as part of their re-education and brainwashing.

","Let's face it - Angelina Jolie can not act. The only reason we shell out money to see her on silver screen is her exotic hotness and sort of senseless energy. Well, in Salt she delivers very little of either. I was with a friend, he's male, straight and nerdy - the very Jolie fan material - and he said DO NOT WANT. No surprise here. She looks gaunt and weak even for a trophy-girl character, let alone a cool action heroine. Her media persona also gets in the way. We hear so much about Ms Jolie that is really hard to forget who she is in real life and trust the character. You know watching a saintly UN ambassador and mother of I don't know how many at the moment, rush about and fire guns left and right is somewhat uncomfortable. <br/><br/>Unlike many other fellow Russian viewers I don't feel insulted by the caricature way of portraying Russians in the movie. It is Hollywood, for God's sake, when did they do justice to any foreign culture? In American cinematic (or cultural, at large) mythology foreigners are either quirky villains or ""ingenious people"". You choose. I rather find it extremely funny that Russia still has that big evil image movie makers can cash on.

","""Salt"" may start off with some clunky storytelling, but once the action takes off (which it doesn't take too long to do), it's a senseless joyride, finding a niche style that fits nicely between ""Bourne""-style realism and ""Mission Impossible"" inanity (yes, a mask is used at one point in the movie). Of course, the driving force is Angelina Jolie as Evelyn Salt, a CIA agent who is accused of being a Russian spy. Salt is altogether a static character, but shifts in narrative constantly make our view of her dynamic, not letting us know whether to pin her as hero or antihero, and Jolie plays this ambiguity to perfection. The movie itself isn't perfect, though - to me, occasional plot holes made it more confusing than ""Inception,"" and the idea of a Cold War carry-over in this day and age is somewhat laughable. Still, the movie plays its thrills right, and character of Salt fulfills what she was written to be - a bona fide action star."
"MaxBorg89","7","1","4","23 September 2010"," The name is Salt, Evelyn Salt...
","Despite the massive hype surrounding the film, including a trailer that gave away nothing in regards to the secretive plot, there was one major factor speaking against Phillip Noyce's latest action movie, Salt: the fact that one Tom Cruise, though never officially attached, had turned down the lead role - subsequently redesigned for Angelina Jolie - in favor of the disappointing Knight and Day, which he considered a better, more ""fun"" option. However, Noyce's track record has always been an almost foolproof guarantee of entertainment, and while it isn't his best film, Salt is a good way to spend two hours at the movies.<br/><br/>About that mysterious plot, then: Jolie plays Evelyn Salt, a skilled CIA agent who tries to juggle her career and her personal life the best she can, without having her husband (August Diehl) suspect anything. All's well until a Russian spy is apprehended and a conspiracy involving sleeper agents on US soil, an assassination attempt and the so-called ""Day X"" is revealed. In fact, Evelyn is identified by this spy as one of the Russian undercover agents, leading to her arrest at the hands of her colleagues and friends (Liev Schreiber and Chiwetel Ejiofor). One impressive escape later, and Salt is on the run, desperate to prove her innocence, no matter the cost.<br/><br/>It's easy to see why Cruise bailed out: there are certain similarities between Salt and his Mission: Impossible franchise, not least a scene that requires the main character to wear a latex mask (although the Slat version is far less convincing and makes for one of the picture's more laughable moments). What sets Salt apart, though, is a more reality-based premise: Day X is - apparently - something that gets mentioned in Intelligence circles, and a similar sleeper mission was discovered just a few months before the film's premiere. How odd, then, that Kurt Wimmer's screenplay (reportedly worked on by Brian Helgeland as well) is less precise than the circumstances would promise, with certain contrivances being too outlandish for the genre and the entire final act resting on a couple of plot holes. Clearly, attention has been put on action rather than narrative coherence.<br/><br/>But oh, what action: never once stopping to breathe, the movie jumps from one set-piece to the next, keeping the adrenaline levels high and suspension of disbelief within reasonable boundaries (check out the Matrix-inspired highway chase). Noyce clearly cherishes this chance to make a kick-ass genre flick, and he has found his perfect ally in Jolie, much changed since their previous collaboration (The Bone Collector, a decade back): having evolved from an acting force to be reckoned with to go-to action lady (see Tomb Raider, Mr and Mrs Smith or Wanted), she delivers the good from beginning to end, cheerfully overshadowing equally talented people like Screiber and Ejiofor. If a sequel were to materialize (not entirely impossible), it would be worth it just to see her on the run once again.<br/><br/>A great spy flick, then? No, not quite. But it's a lot of genuine fun while it lasts, as long as no one starts questioning the logic. I mean, who needs that when you've got Jolie doing her usual stuff?"

","Diane and I saw this film today without knowing anything about it and we were both surprised and satisfied (although tired) at the end of the movie; tired because it requires visual concentration and mind concentration to follow the script ins and outs. I think that I have sat through enough Hollywood thrillers to pretty much know how a film will play out without, of course, knowing the exact sequence of events in the script but Salt was very different. From the opening scenes of the film all the way through, the action just kept happening. To me, there were no quiet moments where the various elements of the plot were allowed to come together and give the viewer a little break to catch their breath; the pace of the film was somewhere around 95% for the entire film.<br/><br/>Salt was directed by Phillip Noyce, an Australian director, and he kept the film rolling very quickly. I must hand it to him, or to the Editor (or both probably) because the physical action scenes were very deftly cut. Jolie (not that I am that knowledgeable about her roles) was asked to do some amazing bits of physical fighting and the action was cut quickly giving the viewer a high speed ride through much of the film. The action was pretty much nonstop through the film and it was truly a fantasy because the action was just for video games and comic books because it was improbable.

","""Who is Salt?"" ask the posters. ""You think everyone's who they say they are?"" ask the trailers. The point being that this is a character of ambiguity. But at one point, even the filmmakers themselves didn't know. The project originally placed Tom Cruise in the eponymous role, but he backed out to do action-romantic-comedy 'Knight And Day'. Cue a series of rewrites: Angelina Jolie was signed up, male became female, and Edwin became Evelyn. So – who is Salt?<br/><br/>Evelyn Salt is a CIA agent accused of being a Russian spy. She must straighten things out, and ensure the safety of her husband, by breaking faces and blowing things up. She is a girl in a boy's game. Her character is a full-on invasion of territory dominated by Bond, Bourne and Bauer. The film assimilates the best parts of each franchise, and adds its own twist. It has espionage cool, brutality and a disregard for protocol, yet it doesn't feel tired because this time it's done with a woman.<br/><br/>The action woman routine is not new, but it's never been presented seriously. 'Tomb Raider' had explosions, but then Lara Croft (portrayed by Jolie in the film franchise) is a disproportionately-bosomed video game character. TV series 'Alias' tried to replicate Bond's gun and gadgets formula, but Sydney Bristow was reduced to Action Barbie with a colourful collection of wigs. Evelyn Salt, however, is first and foremost a spy. No puns, no flashy tools, no bullshit.<br/><br/>Jolie has already demonstrated her worth over the years, both as an action girl and as a 'proper', character-delving actress. Replacing Tom Cruise with her is a pretty safe bet, and she doesn't disappoint. In a film that makes a point of masking the true intentions of its central character, the glue that holds everything together is the level of uncertainty that the film can maintain. Jolie seamlessly switches between vicious and vulnerable, resulting in a convincing prey-predator performance that keeps you guessing.<br/><br/>Action fans will find plenty to enjoy. The whole affair is energetic, with barely a slow moment in the tight 99-minute runtime. This is no-fluff storytelling at its best. Every scene has a purpose. The auxiliary characters are intentionally underdeveloped narrative devices, mere accessories to Jolie's face-breaking rampage. The action itself is neatly done, brutal like Bourne and Daniel Craig-era Bond but with the Michael Bay Effect toned way down. The camera-work is still hand-held and shaky at times, but director Phillip Noyce is sensible enough to let the action, not the editing, do the talking. The result: action scenes that are, most of the time, both kinetic *and* coherent.<br/><br/>'Salt' is not about the all-out silly fun of 'The A-Team', or the doom and gloom of 'The Departed'. Most of the time, it does a pretty good job of balancing serious storytelling with fun. Where it goes wrong is the over-ambition of certain stunts, with one or two moments really pushing the boundaries. It doesn't go anywhere near as far as the car vs. helicopter/truck vs. fighter jet scenes in 'Die Hard 4', but these silly moments can distract. Still, these are minor flaws in an otherwise enjoyable experience. Regardless of how much the film tries to keep a straight face, credibility has never been the point of action films.<br/><br/>Who is Salt? She is 007's substitute in the face of MGM's current financial troubles. Bond 23 will not be making an appearance any time soon, and in the meanwhile, audiences have a new franchise. 'Salt' is a capable, and very welcome, alternative."

Every action movie has the real factor.. yes, at times there are scenes that are 'impossible'. Unless you see a documentary, that is typically the case. This is her best action performance yet. The courage & determination her character gives for her passion & love is something all women admire, the action & good looks hook in the men. I hope the sequel has a deeper plot. It's definitely worth a continuation of the story. I have a new found respect for the maturing Angelina Jolie. Leib Scheiber's performance was pretty good too."
"sandover","Null","1","4","30 August 2010"," The mind taps twice for salt
","Alright, the summary is actually a verse. Does it actually explain anything about the film? No. Perhaps yes. Perhaps perhaps.<br/><br/>Oh, I feel so amused, because this must be one of the best examples I know of brain-washing, ridiculously shifting build-up films. But to what purpose? Can there be such a thing as ambiguous nihilism? Salt is practically mute all the time, so we can not really empathize with what she goes through (although arguably Jolie is at her best here), or what motives there are, if any, because to empathize one has to speak. And when Salt speaks, it is mostly to herself, via flash-backs, that have no actual relief, in the double sense of the word, if one has to talk about double things, since double things, well, semi-happen on screen...<br/><br/>So, if you go for amazing, senseless build-ups, go for it. I won't ask your motive. I didn't have the time to ask myself, since I enjoy it when a director can pick any material and give it some kind of verisimilitude even if it is outrageously far-fetched (as here) but by the end, I was somehow, not pleasingly, exhausted. I recognized the promise of a sequel, that, despite the fact whether I have enjoyed the film or not I find it amusing when it happens, but this time there was some kind of ashen taste in my mouth. Jolie's exploitation of her mega-star status is the ongoing thrust of her movies, but she must resolve what kind of agent she is: super-modern-matriarch, star-on-the-cube, or relentless philanthropist? There is something unforgivably stern in her act."
"natalie-namastay","8","1","4","29 August 2010"," Great Summer Action Movie
","Though it may not be a film that is considered a classic in the action genre, it was a very entertaining movie with an interesting and intricate plot line. The action and acting were great, for a summer time film, and it did a very good job of keeping the viewer engaged and on the edge of their seat. It's not very believable, but part of the magic of movies is allowing yourself to get lost in a film for two and a half hours. Yes, the story was similar to the Bourne series, but I don't mind considering they were great movies as well. The actual filming was good, a little shaky at times, but that comes with the action genre. The only part that bothered me was the obvious set up for a sequel, but other than that, I thought Salt was a movie well worth seeing."
"marc-830-649119","8","1","4","29 August 2010"," Good Film!
","I was somewhat reluctant to see this after watching the dreadful Mr & Mrs Smith. And Wanted was just as bad.<br/><br/>Thankfully someone had actually decided that the film should contain a plot, even if a far fetched one.<br/><br/>I won't go into too much of the actual plot as the theme is revealed in the trailer and I don't want to spoil all the twists and turns that leave you wondering ""is she, or isn't she a spy"" up until the end.<br/><br/>The action is very fast paced and Jolie almost seems to revive her Tomb raider role and stunts in this one. Except that there's no overt CGI. It is surprisingly violent for a 12a, although not gratuitously so.<br/><br/>The premise that the Russians have created 'replacement' spetznatz spies to live as Americans until activated does hark back to the cold war stories of the 60's and 70's. It makes a change from the Islamic enemies that appear in most movies now. Nelson DeMille's book, The Charm School has a very similar plot.<br/><br/>Go and see it, put your brain in neutral and enjoy the ride. And wait for the sequel, probably called SALT 2, but I doubt its anything to do with Strategic Arms Limitations Talks."
"Ryan_MYeah","6","1","4","23 August 2010"," It's not perfect, but it's one the year's more ambitious films.
","This weekend, I got out to see Salt, a recent Summer action flick.<br/><br/>In the film, Angelina Jolie plays Evelyn Salt, a woman working for the Central Intelligence Agency, who is happily married to a German arachnologist. But Salt's world is turned upside down once a mysterious Russian man walks into the offices of the CIA with information. He states that Salt is a double agent for the Russians. This leads to steadily, and swiftly raising paranoia, none the least of which from fellow agent Ted Winters (Played by Liev Schreiber), and ONCIX agent, Peabody (Played by Chiwetel Ejofor). Salt proclaims she is innocent, but actions later in the movie seem to imply otherwise. Serious deceptions begin to cloud many serious truths, initiating a chain of events that places Russia, and the United States on a course of self destructive collisions.<br/><br/>The plot of this movie is... kind of predictable, to be honest, and on top of that, a little reminiscent. You can kind of think it as a cross between The Fugitive, and the Bourne Identity, with a woman in the lead role normally played a man. There are lots of obvious Boom, boom, bangs! Gunfights, fistfights, car chases, and a couple of over the top, yet strangely awesome death scenes (Which of course, I won't go into detail about). But the movie is actually fun in its simplicity. The action is well staged, fast paced, pretty impressive, and expertly choreographed. It does help the movie.<br/><br/>As does the cast. First bit of praise here goes to Jolie, who continues to prove that not only can she be a pretty capable dramatic actress, but she still knows a thing or two about how to be a sexy badass action star, and carries the film pretty damn well, might I add. Although, I could possibly imagine some people taking her performance for granted, simply because she only makes it look so easy. The rest of the cast such as Schreiber, Ejofor, and Daniel Olbrychski are pretty top notch.<br/><br/>However, I must stress that Salt is a far from perfect movie. I think director Phillip Noyce could have seriously worked out some of the flaws of the movie, maybe even working some kinks out of Kurt Wimmer's script. Some things in the story feel pretty rushed, but it's balanced out by the good things about the movie, the last of which being the techs. The film's technical crew, such as DP Robert Elswit, film editors Stuart Baird and John Gilroy, Stunt coordinators Simon Crane and Wade Eastwood, and Sound Mixers Jeffrey Haboush, Scott Millan, Greg Russell and William Sarokin did their jobs fantastically.<br/><br/>Simply put, I think I've found what will be one of my biggest guilty pleasures of the year. It's predictable, but the action is fun, and pacing is fast. And Angelina Jolie on her own, makes the movie worth a look.<br/><br/>I give Salt **1/2 out of ****"
"estebangonzalez10","6","1","4","23 August 2010"," Angelina Jolie is Agent Salt, and that is all that matters
","¨My name is Evelyn Salt.¨ Salt isn't your smart, suspenseful typical thriller, it isn't The Bourne Identity, it simply is a mindless blockbuster action film starring one of the best action stars of our decade: Angelina Jolie. Yes, I said best action star, and perhaps in a couple of decades she will be staring in a female version of The Expendables. Jolie is fun to watch on screen and we can't seem to take our eyes off her and that is why we went to go see this movie in the first place because I doubt anyone went into this picture expecting a smart film when they heard Kurt Wimmer wrote the original screenplay, the man who brought us Ultraviolet. Director, Phillip Noyce worked with Angelina Jolie in the past with The Bone Collector, before she had become such a huge star, and he is also known for directing Tom Clancy movies such as Clear and Present Danger. The problem with Salt is that Wimmer is no Clancy and the plot is pretty ridiculous, but what saves him is that Jolie is a pretty dependable star and we want to believe pretty much anything she does. Angelina seems to be in pretty good shape as she runs for the entire 100 minutes and jumps from bridges, moving vehicles, elevator shafts, and helicopters. She is able to single handedly outrun the CIA, FBI, and whoever stands in her way, and can even get past White House security. When you have so many absurd situations and plot holes the best thing you can do is rely on Jolie to jump from one mind numbing scene to another.<br/><br/>Angelina Jolie is Salt, a CIA agent who won the respect of her colleagues after suffering as a prisoner in North Korea without giving away any information. Her boss, Ted Winter (Liev Schreiber), rescues her by exchanging her for another prisoner. Salt's husband Mike (August Diehl) is the reason why she's still alive because the CIA had made it clear they would sacrifice her for the greater good, but his insistence pays off and Salt is forever indebted to him. Twelve years later, on her anniversary, a Russian man comes to the agency saying he has crucial information. His name is Orlov (Daniel Olbrychski) and Salt has to interrogate him. He tells her a story about an organization called ¨Day X¨ that's destined to destroy the United States. He claims that a powerful man has trained a group of kids to infiltrate the country and pass as Americans, but they are actually Russian spy's who will attack on Day X. One of these spies will kill the Russian President, and her name is Evelyn Salt. Winter doesn't believe these claims, but Peabody (Chiwetel Ejiofor) says he has to arrest her. Salt argues she isn't a spy, but she is worried about her husband and decides to escape knowing that her actions might remove all doubts about her being a spy. From this point on the film became a high speed chase which is a relief because the plot was going downhill and our mind needed to be diverted.<br/><br/>I thought the movie was going to completely lose me in the first 15 minutes when Orlov showed up and the plot was unfolded. The ¨Day X¨ organization seemed completely ridiculous and I was hating the movie, but after the action began at least my mind was distracted and I was entertained with the chase scenes. Jolie made the otherwise ridiculous movie entertaining. There was plenty of action and the movie could be enjoyed simply as a blockbuster movie, but don't expect an intelligent thriller, and keep your mind off the plot and the ridiculous twists. Liev Schreiber and Ejiofor were decent in their supporting roles and did what they could with the terrible script. The only reason why I enjoyed this movie and had fun was because of Angelina Jolie who is a bankable action star, but if you happen not to be a fan of her work then I guarantee you will hate this film. This is one of those movies you enjoy seeing once, but probably wouldn't want to watch again. It is a fun, but forgettable blockbuster action movie.<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"
"thekyles99","6","1","4","22 August 2010"," Loads of twists and turns!!!
","Great espionage tale. Loads of twists and turns and i found a lot of similarities to the Bourne trilogy. Jolie must love these types of roles and why cant we have a female action hero anyways? Evelyn Salt (angelina) is a CIA operative who is heading home after a hard days work when a Russian spy just walks in off the street. After opting to stay an extra 30-45mins to interrogate this suspicious person she wasn't prepped for the can of worms she was about to open. After an astonishing statement by the Russian operative that she herself is in fact a Russian agent she flees the CIA headquarters (in interesting fashion) and this entails a huge game of cat and mouse. Director Phillip Noyce (bone collector,patriot games,sliver) gives an espionage tale that rarely has a dull moment as most of his scripts do not. Great casting with Liev Schreiber,Chiwetel Ejifor rounding out the cast."

","Salt is filled with ridiculous ideas, plot holes the size of the sun, and completely overblown action. So, is it worth you time? If you can accept it for what it is, a vehicle for action, then it absolutely is.<br/><br/>Its a movie that is honest with itself; it doesn't try to be something that it isn't. If, for example, the characters had been developed beyond the shallow point in which they are, then it might have been impossible to appreciate the film. But the film never pretends to be more than a vehicle for ridiculous action and as such, it works.<br/><br/>Angelina Jolie is effective, but her efforts again play against the silliness of the film.<br/><br/>Comparisons with Bourne are inevitable(especially the end scene), but this is a silly movie for the silly season, and as such, it compares favorably to the rest of the drivel."
"laurapreece85","6","1","4","18 August 2010"," President?
","Biggest question........ Did the President (USA) survive? If so, why did they not just ask him what happened? He could have told them it wasn't her? It was an enjoyable enough film, too much action, not enough plot development though. The ""twist"" was obvious but a sequel wouldn't even have that much. As many of you have said, to believe she gets thrown about that much and doesn't crack like an egg with her physique is far too implausible. I'd be scared to shake her hand for fear it might fall off, never mind assist her escape out of a helicopter. Also, they could have got someone better to play the husband and developed his part further, he was like a wet spider-loving fish. I was hoping he would turn out to be a baddie."
"kels-errific","9","1","4","14 August 2010"," First great movie of the summer!
","I loved this movie! I caught a DVD of one of Angelina's first movies, cyborg 2, and saw her do some brief action pieces. You see in Cyborg 2 a shimmer of the force of nature we have now. What a difference time makes! She is a veteran action star, and I can't think of another actor who has as much ability and talent and Ms. Jolie does. Within 25 minutes of the movie, we see her blow up a room full of guards, shimmy around a high story building, escape on a freeway by jumping onto motor vehicles, its breathtaking! The pace continues to a fever pitch, and you as a viewer can not help but feel a rush when Salt gets down to business. The plot involves a tale involving Russian sleeper agents, and had a few twists that took me and my guy by surprise. I really enjoyed the story and found myself gripping the seat for the next scene. Salt is a force to be reckoned with: she is resourceful and an intimidating threat, her fight scenes are just brutal. To think that Tom Cruise once was set to star in this movie is just unfathomable. For action fans, you can't do any better. Angelina delivers and proves that the action era once populated by men has come to a close. I gave this movie a healthy nine because I can't remember the last time I had that much fun at the movies! A definite recommend!"
"ANGEL-S","8","1","4","14 August 2010"," Learn your prison before your freedom
","I gave this movie a strong 8, because I really enjoyed it. I had no assumptions and prejudice prior seeing it, beside seeing poster at the local cinema and maybe I was simply in the mood for a spy/action last night.<br/><br/>Interesting point here is a philosophical theme of choice and human freedom, which is taken to the extreme level for selected people who live isolated from the start with special purpose to become infiltrated and highly sophisticated spies. Angelina has managed to keep this movie coherent to the very end and the viewer eventually becomes interested in protagonist's destiny.<br/><br/>Action scenes are decent, except occasional jumping from truck to truck, but this is already seen so many times (Matrix Reloaded for example) so I can forgive them that. Salt is clever, extremely fast thinker, skillful and talented warrior, and I like that movie does not necessarily exploits her physical appearance, at least not in a rude way. That's why I think this is Angelina's ""smarter"" movie so far.<br/><br/>Exciting and entertaining."
"MovieManMenzel","7","1","4","12 August 2010"," ""Salt"" is everything the TV spots and commercials promise it to be.
","When venturing into the movie theater with my girlfriend Ashley last night, I actually didn't know what to think of ""Salt."" I mean from the television spots and trailers, the movie looked like it would be a decent action flick so I was kinda 50/50 on seeing this one. I am normally not a huge fan of Angelina Jolie, I am not saying she is a bad actress but I just don't think she lives up to all the hype that surrounds her. With that being said, my girlfriend thinks Angelina is ""awesome"" so I figured this would be an interesting film to have a debate on the drive home. So without further delay, I begin my review of ""Salt."" <br/><br/>""Salt"" tells the story of CIA Agent Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie), whose life seems perfect despite her troubled past. The movie starts off showing Salt happily married and enjoying her job working for the CIA. One day, there is a security breach at the agency. It turns out the breach was done by a Russian man, who was sent there to inform the CIA of a Russian spy who has infiltrated the CIA. This Russian man claims the the spy's name is Evelyn Salt. This is where the fun begins as Salt must do everything she can to prove she isn't a spy or is she? Lots of action ensues...<br/><br/>Let me start off my saying this...if you have seen the trailers or television spots for ""Salt"" than you know exactly what to expect from the film. ""Salt"" delivers on everything it promises from its advertisements. It's an action packed film that definitely delivers on the action. With that being said, if you think ""Salt"" offers anything fresh and new to the action genre, well I tell you now, it doesn't. My problem with ""Salt"" is just that. The storyline was extremely predictable and within the first 10 minutes I already figured out where the film was going. The action is intense and well delivered, however, like most action films most scenes are extremely far fetched and unbelievable. There is nothing about ""Salt"" that really makes it stick out from other action films besides the actors. At many times with the scenes shown in the film, you also feel like your watching ""Die Hard"" or ""Taken"" but with Angelina Jolie in the drivers seat so to speak.<br/><br/>When watching the film, you as the audience member are entertained all the way through, which I give the film a lot of credit for. The problem is ""Salt"" requires you to really turn your brain off in order to truly enjoy it. Again, I guess that's typical nowadays from Hollywood action films. After viewing ""Salt,"" I now see why so many people have raved about ""Inception"" because that was a film that was action packed, thought provoking, and truly made you think. Nolan somehow created a film that even though it was fiction, it almost felt like it could happen in reality. In ""Salt"" all belief must be suspended in order to truly appreciate the film.<br/><br/>Angelina Jolie throws on her normal action woman skills here. I can't say Jolie really shows off her acting chops here. If you want to see Jolie truly act, you have to check out her drama roles. They are the roles that truly show off her talent. In this film, she is just a kick ass woman. Think of Keanu Reeves in ""The Matrix"" and mix it with Liam Neeson's character in ""Taken"" and you pretty much have Salt. Liev Schreiber, who despite being a jerk in real life, is actually a great actor and again like Jolie this film didn't show off his true talents. But he did a good job as well with the material he had. As for the rest of the supporting cast, all did a good job for the type of film it is. I have zero complaints in the acting department.<br/><br/>With everything being said and done, I can't knock ""Salt"" too much because it gave me everything the marketing promised it would. I was entertained for the 105 minute run-time and even though I enjoy to think with my action, I may expect too much from a normal Hollywood director. I totally understand why films like this have average ratings because truly it is an average film but it does get credit for delivering on what it promised. As long as you don't go into ""Salt"" expecting anything mind-blowing and original than you should enjoy ""Salt."" If you are a fan of Jolie, especially in the action roles, well this one is a must see for you because like my girlfriend said, ""it was awesome for the action and Jolie kicks ass."" I think with that being said, if you like action flicks, you can't go wrong but if you want something smart and fresh, skip ""Salt"" and see ""Inception"" instead.<br/><br/>MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""Salt"" is a 7 out of 10. As long as you go into the film not expecting anything other than a normal action flick you should be able to sit back and enjoy the ride!"
"svgbtz1","5","1","4","11 August 2010"," Unbelievable like most of today's action films
","OK so I decided to go see this movie base on all the criticism and defense Angelina Jolie has received about her fight scenes. This review will be 2 fold, 1st I am not defending AJ because her size in this film is far from her Tomb Raider days.<br/><br/>I am writing this review while watching the Turbo Jam infomercial Women. Even if AJ was the size of these girls the movie would still be unbelievable, acceptable but still unbelievable and here's why:<br/><br/>No hero in any action movie can be believable when his/her opponents are equally trained, unless of course the hero is Arnold who out weighs most of his opponents by at least 50 lbs. Lets take a look at the Bourne movies, In the Bourne Movies Jason Bourne has a tough time when fighting opponents who have went through the same training as he did. The thought that any action hero can easily defeat his/her equally trained opponents would tell us that the CIA, NSA, FBI, has a few well train A+ agents and the rest of the agents are C- or less. You watch these 2 on 1 fight scenes and realize the opponents are going down with almost one punch. This movie is entertaining but nothing when compared to the Bourne series. For me the ending was very predictable yet the movie was still worth the matinée price or at least worth watching as a DVD if your incline to wait.<br/><br/>Again if she was in Tomb Raider shape the movie would be acceptable. The thought of Angelina not breaking any bone during her falls in the scenes with the trucks is truly unbelievable.<br/><br/>I have to agree with the many who have critiqued AJ's sized in this film. Perhaps they should use the Turbo Jam girl in the reboot."
"KevinB12","9","1","4","9 August 2010"," Angelina Jolie would team up with Jennifer Garner
","Angelina Jolie's movie Salt is a wonderful movie because she is an excellent action woman like Jennifer Garner is like for her television show Alias. Angelina would make an excellent team with Jennifer Garner for future action movies. Angelina Jolie can learn martial arts from Jennifer Garner; Jackie Chan and Jean Claude Van Damme for her future action movies if she learns martial arts and self defence. I know Megan Fox would not make an excellent action person because she is more for comedy and drama movies only. Leave the action movies to Angelina Jolie and Jennifer Garner. Maybe Angelina Jolie can make a great Wonder Woman or Batgirl if they are going to make such movies as a suggestion later in life."

But she's hot,and well casted in this role. Salt is a lot of fun. It explodes with excitement. Salt is a stylish thriller.

"Samiam3","6","1","4","8 August 2010"," Good in parts, but feels silly, derivative and too open ended
","Salt sounds like a pretty good deal, what it delivers is just mildly good. As is typical of everything Kurt Wimmer writes, Salt mistakes street smart for intelligent smart. I thought this was pretty dumb, maybe even Wimmer's dumbest movie yet. Okay fine, Ultraviolet was pretty silly, but then again, it was a b-movie right, (this isn't)<br/><br/>Salt has a few good action scenes, which work well individually, but the film in its entirety doesn't amount to much. It feels rushed, shallow, devoid of common sense, and has an ending which makes the story feel vastly incomplete; perhaps a tell tale sign of a sequel to come.<br/><br/>Director Phillip Noyce knows how to Make Angelina Jolie look good on camera, but she isn't much of a character. Her performance is a huge step up from her last action film Wanted, but even so, her function here is not too dissimilar. She has little to do outside of running around and killing people.<br/><br/>Treated as an extended chase scene, Salt could easily get an A+, but as a hundred minute story, it feels rather feeble. It is a derivative spy/thriller which is usually slick, and certainly not dull, but its superficiality and general lack of brains make it difficult to appreciate to the full."

"KineticSeoul","7","1","4","6 August 2010"," What could have been ""Black Widow"" the movie
","I am glad Angelina Jolie took the main role as Evelyn Salt, instead of Tom Cruise taking the main role thanks to his busy schedule. The script was written for Tom Cruise at first thought until he had to step down from the role. Although the movie as a whole is slightly above average, Angelina Jolie did a great job playing a badass heroine. And it's sort of refreshing to see a badass heroine in theaters. Not all of the plot holes gets patched up at the end and it's starts from somewhat of a believable movie and from than on it's gets sillier and sillier. But the main reason I go to the movies, is to be entertained and watching a badass heroine kick ass was quite fun to watch, although I think they should have went with the silly approach from the beginning instead of trying to make it believable. Especially the action scenes were just dumb at times, but as a whole the film is forgivable because the way the plot is connected with the action scenes is engaging enough. If your one of those viewers that nit pick everything that ain't realistic in these types of film than you probably won't enjoy it as much, but if you just take it for what it is. It might be a entertaining ride. I personally thought it was a pretty entertaining action flick. Some of the characters decisions doesn't make much sense and that includes few of the action sequences as well. When it comes to the plot of this movie. It could have easily been Marvel's ""Black Widow"" movie. Maybe it's because they couldn't get the rights for the character or maybe they just didn't have the budget to get the rights for Black Widow. Overall, it's a okay rental but it's also easily forgettable action movie. <br/><br/>7.3/10"

Some examples which also using the similar patterns recently are John Travolta's ""From Paris with Love"" (2009), Tom Cruise's ""Knight and Day"" (2010), Ashton Kutcher's""Killers"" (2010) and now it's the time for Jolie. The story follows Evelyn Salt (Jolie) who is wrongly accused as a Russian spy and now she has to clear her name by finding the invisible enemy. The Director is Phillip Noyce, the man behind ""The Bone Collector"" in 1999 (also with Jolie). The camera angle is dynamic, especially in action sequences. Yes, the movie is filled with twists and turns, even sometimes the story just goes by itself without proper explanations, leaving too many questions and missing links. That is uniqueness of the plots! The story effectively draws our curiosity. It is success to make us stay put in our seat by expecting what is going to happen next. To let Jolie fuses into action adventure like thiz is just like releasing the fish into water, it's simply what she does best. Jolie is still in the spotlight, shines among her mysterious partner (Liev Schreiber) and strict boss (Chiwetel Eijiofor). If someone complains about how absurd thiz narratives has become, it's simply arguable and it all happens to every modern action movies nowadays.

Seems to have an ill divided conspiracy of what essentially Cold War 2.0 and now thinking back, the reveal of Salt's true role was completely non sensical and I'd anything disadvantageous to the campaign. Action scenes were a highlight, one of the only things it can be proud of. Everything in between is shambolic and the sequel bait at the end is shameless.

","This movie has about as much relation to spy craft as watching a Star Trek TV program would help you understand the Apollo space program, but without even the occasional social moral theme that Trek throws in . Nothing in in made any sense. Spies aren't killer cyborgs who can burst into a building and disable trained guards and agents with bare hands or improvise Rube Goldberg devices then deactivate complicated electro-mechanical systems as if they designed and built them themselves. She made Rambo look like a drunk college baseball player fighting in a local college bar on Friday night. She seemed to have the same mythical warrior invincibility as Alice the Enhanced One has in all those Resident Evil movies & video games. I realize that James Bond commando kung fu trained warriors are the norm in movies these days, but at least James Bond used to be novel and humorous, unlike our Terminatrix here.<br/><br/>The climax involved a couple of Russian deep plant agents taking over the Whitehouse and president so they can launch nuclear weapons, natch. ""Whitehouse Down"" and ""Olympus Has Fallen"" had similar plot lines but there at least there was a whole bunch of bad guys, and lots of them were killed fighting the various security forces stationed there. But here one of the agents runs interference for our female cyborg by detonating a suicide bomb vest all of 10' from her, in an underground corridor. But our female terminator was barely fazed by the enormous blast. Or in an earlier scene, she stages this elaborate kill operation on the president of Russia in a cathedral in NYC where she sets up all sorts of stunts and booby traps in a place she was utterly unfamiliar with & had all of five minutes to set up the stunts that worked perfectly. Then she takes out 3 NYC cops in an SUV while in cuffs. Not just that but she used a stun gun to get the driver to shift gears, apply the gas or steer the wheel as if she tapped right into to his neural pathways with the zapper. That was so silly it even one upped the rest of the stunts; and it was pretty sadistic thing to do to some schmoe cop who was just doing his job.<br/><br/>I watched it because the highway scene was filmed nearby and I borrowed the DVD gratis. If you like a lot of action but don't care about plot or even a glimmer of reality to the script, then you might like it.<br/><br/>That being said, Jolie did well with her limited female kill-bot role. The black CIA Guy, Chiwetel Ejiofor, did well too. The rest of the cast, including wooden Liev Schreiber, were adequate at best. There is nothing I took out of this movie worth remembering save some well done but a load of ""impossible in real life"" stunts. Even the paper thin veneer of humanity and ambiguity most of the fawning reviews spoke of are flat. We knew she was some fancy Russian Manchurian double agent type, something about being conditioned in Russia when she was young by the same guy who ratted her out later. That had been established early in the movie. It was easy to predict that she was a good bad guy character who in the end wouldn't do anything very heinous, She'll just kill lots of bad bad guys but only seriously disable the good ones."

If I cite examples, I will spoil the movie for those who haven't seen it, but let's just say that they appear to have spent so much on their budget on fight scenes and Angelina's ""bee-stung"" lips that there couldn't have been enough left to pay for a couple of decent script writers.Skyfall it isn't, although it was wasn't offensively bland.<br/><br/>I've given this a 5 out of 10 for no better reason than I am mesmerised by Angelina Jolie (who isn't?), but I wouldn't want to have paid full price to watch this in a cinema (theatre to all you Hollywood types).<br/><br/>Last point, not relevant to the film, but congrats to IMDb allowing people to post up in real English at last"

","You can cast a beautiful woman in a bad movie, but it's still a bad movie. The 6.5 rating is a joke. I don't remember the last time I saw a movie this bad! I'm an avid movie watcher, and I'm usually willing to accept a film with a few flaws if it's at least enjoyable. But Salt has so many flaws, I couldn't even give it credit for being entertaining.<br/><br/>If you don't mind wasting an hour and forty minutes of your life just to watch Angelina Jolie punch, kick, and shoot people, be my guest. Because the fact that she looks incredible while she does it is literally the only redeeming factor for this movie. The ""plot"" is vague, confusing, and has holes the size of Milwaukee. I was seriously tempted to start tallying the clichés. As I've heard, this was supposed to be an action film. So you'd think the action would at least be up to par. But...no. 50 million gunshots and slow-mo grenades later, they decide to completely bend the rules of physics in a way that wasn't even cool enough to warrant it.<br/><br/>Not to mention the dialogue. Good lord, it was almost painful. The script sounds like it was written by a committee under a time crunch. Liev Schrieber, Jolie, and even Andre Braugher couldn't save it. They are all talented actors and you could tell they were doing the best they could with it, but it was still painful. I literally could not feel for the characters even if I tried, they were that shallow.<br/><br/>Throughout the entire film, I tried to give Salt the benefit of the doubt. I told myself: ""Maybe you're being too harsh. There is always hope that it will come together at the end and surprise you."" I got to the end. False hope. My advice: if you want to stare at Angelina Jolie for an hour (I mean really, who doesn't?), pick up a tabloid magazine instead of watching this--because it would have more substance than Salt. (Or, just pick a better Jolie flick. There are plenty of them)"

It mainly involves the apparent mission of an indestructible Russian/American triple agent played by Angelina Jolie up against double and triple agents galore all out to, well, destroy the world. On the way many people are ruthlessly kicked to bits, butchered, or both; endlessly running down corridors toting guns has been used many times before to much better effect. On the other hand it's a film that can leave you thinking about it long after it's done and I admit I also stayed interested in hopefully finding out who's zoomin' who: the answers returned the producers and me.

","The story is weak and also illogical. So many holes in this movie. The plot is simple but with big ambition which the scriptwriter couldn't follow through. The acting is good, even though many scenes are incredibly hard to swallow. Unbelievable actions yielding unbearable effort to watch. Angelina Jolie is the only good thing in this movie, not only because I'm a fan of her, but also... sadly to say... she starred in the wrong movie. Her acting is right on the dot, her action sequences were good, but her character and the surreal actions make it unbelievable to a point of annoyance. Her co-star, Liev Schreiber, did a good job while the supporting actor, Chiwetel Ejiofor, and others, were terrible (maybe because of direction, I believe). In short, this would make a good B-movie starring someone like Krista Allen or Kari Wuhrer.

"TheUnknown837-1","9","1","6","4 August 2010"," A textbook example of a great, swashbuckling thriller. It keeps you guessing.
","If you decide you are going to see ""Salt"" in a theater, which I strongly encourage you to do, then I must give you some sincere advice. Number one, make sure you have all the popcorn and drinks you can need. Number two, make sure you won't have to go to the restroom halfway through. Because if you miss so much as five minutes of this genuinely swashbuckling thriller, you are going to walk back into the auditorium confused beyond belief. Like the Jason Bourne movies and ""The International,"" it's one of those spy thrillers that keeps on the move, throwing twists and surprises at you all the time. It's a strong, kinetic spy movie and furthermore, it's tied with ""Toy Story 3"" for the title of the best movie that I have seen this year so far.<br/><br/>Because this plot is so complex and so constantly on the move, I can only give you a basic thread of the opening without giving too much away. The movie stars Angelina Jolie as a CIA agent who suddenly finds herself being hunted by a government agent (Chiwetel Ejiofor) who suspects her of being a Russian agent in on a conspiracy to assassinate the Russian president and trigger a global war. Jolie turns into a fugitive on the run as she dodges her former comrades and...<br/><br/>Well, that's all I'm going to give away. The rest, you will have to go see for yourself.<br/><br/>What I really admired about ""Salt"" was the way that it broke from the conventions of the generic spy thriller. I don't want to spoil any surprises, but I will mention this much. The movie does a fantastic job of making you question and wonder just whose side is Angelina Jolie really on? Is she the mole in the system? Or is there another mole entirely? Well, whatever you are expecting, expect again, because you're in for a big surprise. Actually, you are in for a whole lot of surprises. ""Salt"" is buttoned up tight with its pacing, with startling plot twists launching at us one after another. It is also crammed with perfectly seasoned action scenes that are so spectacular that they are not credible, but incredible. Suspension of disbelief is required at many points, but unless you're a CIA agent yourself or just a nitpicker, it shouldn't spoil the fun for you.<br/><br/>In lesser hands, ""Salt"" would have been a complete mess. And let's face it. As genuinely entertaining as it is, it twists its plot so much to the point where it almost becomes ludicrous. Actually, it really is ludicrous, throwing probability right out the window. But what did we learn from the masters like Alfred Hitchcock and Stanley Kubrick? Probability is not really necessary. If you really know how to handle your material, you can make the audience believe your story. And director Phillip Noyce knows how to handle his material. His directing is solid and well-done and he can really coordinate a terrific action scene. And last but not least, I have to give out my praises to the cast. Angelina Jolie, one of our best actresses of modern times, gives another stellar performance in the titular role. Chiwetel Ejiofor, another strong performer, is in prime form as the man hunting her and the truth down. There's also another solid performance by Liev Schreiber as Jolie's superior, who gives strong conviction without doing much else besides glowering and mumbling under his breath."

","""Salt"" was great to watch but the story of Russian spies have not change a lot from what Hollywood tried to portrait from their previous films during the Cold War and after the Cold War. The same thing that never changes at all. The only part that drew me as an audience was action which was greatly performed. Liev and Angelina speaking Russian with weired accent was huge minus to Hollywood Production and director of the film. Being a Russian spy you should speak Russian without any accent as that's how KGB and Russia trains their spy by assigning them for job overseas, they should speak language of the country fluently with dialects so no one should notice of them being foreigners. Angelina and Liev should have trained well to speak and pronounce Russian as their native language.<br/><br/>The best part was to watch actions sequences by Angelina and that's all but the synopses of the film have not changed from previous spy movies produced by Hollywood. People are getting bored to watch the same story over and over again. Also, some actors who were involved in the film portraying Russian spies speak in Russian with such tone of the language that no one in Russia even speak that way.<br/><br/>Without Angelina the movie sucks, Angelina just added some well done actions that adds plus to the ""Salt"", other then that......sorry Hollywood. Hollywood should give chance to other actors to play different parts in film portraying foreigners or Americans. But they always limit this chance to good actors. If Angelina was able to play Russian spy with bad Russian accent I do not understand why foreigner should not play American with his/her accent? But Hollywood always want to have American born actor to play American but not a foreigner. Hollywood always forget that there is no American nationality, or so called American culture, it is a mixture of foreign influence who crated America as the country, country of immigrants.<br/><br/>SALT made $19.5M in box office and the production paid Angelina J. $20M for this movie. Next time Hollywood wants to make movie about Russian spies, please, get down to business and learn true facts about Russian Spy Network in US before writing your script. Tom Cruise was smart enough to turn down Edwin Salt part as it would look ridiculous on him but Angie did it because of actions, she did not care about the story of the film, she wanted some actions and majority of stunts she did in SALT were not performed on her own, she had double who did everything for her. So, do not go around the world and tell people ""I did all my stunts on my own"". Bravo Hollywood, amazing, spectacular to watch you throwing so much money away by making this film when independent filmmakers could have done better job and they always do."

Angelina Jolie spends 2 years in a N.Korean prison out of the reach of Jimmy Carter. She is released in a spy swap. She works for a dummy CIA company in New York which doesn't have a metal detector sophisticated enough to detect knife blades inside of shoes. After Jolie is back in NYC, a Russian defector comes in from the cold and tells us, and the CIA, the plot of the movie. He claims Angelina (Salt) is really a Russian mole, planted here as a child and she is going to kill the Russian president. Salt denies this, and runs away before she could clear herself in order to save her husband. There are numerous minor flashbacks during the movie to fill in plot points. They also make the predictable ""twists"" predictable enough for dummies.<br/><br/>The film makes fun of the real Angelina who can't cook, but can do everything else. She can make a better cannon than William Shatner out of household items. Bobby Clark (Gorn)in a rubber mask would not have stood a chance. She can scale a building in her bare feet and split skirt better than Spider Man (or Spider Babe for Misty Mundae fans). Salt can also jump from the top of truck to truck, better than Tom Cruise and that is after taking a bullet to the hip, which doesn't even give her a limp. Jolie can ride a motorcycle as well as Evel Knievel and can beat up men quicker than Uma Thurman in Kill Bill. I am not sure why the NYPD handcuffed people with their hands in the front. I guess the ""behind the back"" cuff would have made the escape too unbelievable. And Bruce Willis could have taken notes on how to climb down an elevator shaft from Salt.<br/><br/>And during the whole time, her makeup never ran or hair came out of place.

","Salt (2010): Dir: Phillip Noyce / Cast: Angelina Jolie, Liev Schreiber, Chiwetel Ejiofor, August Diehl, Daniel Olbrychski: The ads ask who is Salt? That is a question that switches throughout the film. Angelina Jolie plays Evelyn Salt who is accused of being a Russian spy and is on the run to find her missing husband. It would be great to assume that he realized how shitty this film is and just left the set but unfortunately he is not that lucky. Director Phillip Noyce seems to borrow much from The Fugitive and Mission: Impossible but he is still applying his skill to low grade films in the tradition of earlier junk such as The Bone Collector and The Saint. Jolie pulls her punches and more doing stunts that would kill a normal person. Nonetheless she seems comfortable doing action and her character's mystery is one of the few pluses to this otherwise waste of time. Supporting roles are a real issues leaving Jolie to pretty much carry the film. Liev Schreiber as her CIA friend is too predictable and his position in the third act should surprise no one. Chiwetel Ejiofor was terrific in Dirty Pretty Things but her he is given little to do other than make harsh observations about Salt. August Diehl is a total waste as Salt's husband. He appears briefly in the opening then is seen mainly in flashbacks before viewers are treated to an unnecessary write off that perhaps would not have occurred if the genders were switched. Pointless action farce with grand scale production and explosive action sequences but without the care we give for The Fugitive. Perhaps they will make a sequel called Pepper. Score: 3 ½ / 10"

Salt is recommended if you feel like indulging in sustaining car crashes and mind-games, a considerably well-made film, you'll have fun trying to work out just who Salt is.

","I finally watched the movie after seeing it being played on TV multiple times. Even seeing the trailers many years ago, it never struck me as a movie I must see. However, after hearing many people mention favourable things about the movie, I thought of giving it a chance. Angelina Jolie gives it a strong effort, but is ultimately limited by the necessary physicality of her role. It sort of takes you out of the moment when Jolie is fighting multiple Swat officers and other thugs. I understand that it is her role in the movie, but she doesn't strike you as someone who could beat up these men. I also thought that the law enforcement agencies were particularly inept in being able to apprehend Salt. Her dressing up as the Russian major was also too much of a stretch as something that wouldn't turn heads. Salt's husband also seemed to play a smaller role than I would have thought. There were many plot holes like how the police and CIA didn't immediately clue in on the fact that Salt used the spider venom dart and not an actual bullet."

","Jason Bourne in skirts. This loud, frenetic actioner surrounding a nasty Russian plot (new Cold War story-lines are back in again, it seems) to use ""sleeper"" agents to bump off the President and trigger a war, the plot obviously dreamt up just at the time when real-life Russian agents were being exposed in the States. But what approximated to topicality at the time just seems ridiculously far-fetched now.<br/><br/>Besides the Bourne comparison above, there are elements of Bond, Die Hard Mission Impossible and ""Taken"" undoubtedly hoping a little of their franchise magic might catch on (It seems ""Salt 2"" is on the way), but other than putting a woman in the lead role I don't see anything really distinctively different here to that seen previously in the examples I mention above.<br/><br/>So, inevitably, we get a pounding, headache-inducing James Newton-Howard soundtrack, impossible stunts, none more than Jolie's truck-hopping display early on, twist after twist as the ridiculously contrived plot hurtles to its conclusion and a final last-gasp save, just as you'd expect.<br/><br/>The acting throughout is perfunctory, the characters imbued with as much depth and personality as computer game ciphers. Jolie is certainly athletic and gets to run and jump a lot but in the end this only serves to remind us of her previous incarnation as Lara Croft.<br/><br/>In the final summary, with its mis-calculated new Cold War rhetoric and mindless action sequences, this is really just a movie that wants really to be a computer game, in fact I'm only surprised that unlike ""Tomb Raider"", the game, on this occasion, didn't come first."

","Well, it is a decent action flick, with lots of twists and turns and unpredictable moments - perhaps too much; several scenes have just sophisticated and entertaining value, it is difficult to imagine them happening even theoretically or in the event of a huge turmoil. But the fights are there, as well as chases, explosions and double/triple crossings... However, the movie is too focused on one protagonist and the choice for the role - Angelina Jolie - was not the best, in my opinion, as her build and looks make many fulfillments hard to picture. The other questionable issue was to bring the Cold War into 21st century; moreover, almost all the deeds and plans of Russian characters resembled rather those of Islamic/Arab terrorists. Luckily, the ending is not slushy, and leaves room for a sequel.<br/><br/>If you like political thrillers with strong players, the 1 hour 35 minutes pass with the blah! feeling. But it is no masterpiece, particularly script-wise."

We ended up laughing at each unbelievable piece of action - and when you start laughing then it is no longer an action thriller. In fact learning that Tom Cruise was originally slated to play a male version of Salt, but pulled out, makes me think he realised that it was too over the top to be taken seriously. After all he has made Knight and Day which is full of its own unbelievable action scenes, but is done in a tongue in cheek way so that the audience doesn't throw their hands up in disbelief.<br/><br/>Overall Salt has been done before with Russian sleepers infiltrating Western society to be awoken to redress the power balance Russia's way (No Way Out immediately springs to mind) and the stunts have been done before.

","You know the worst thing about such a movie? It's its beautiful directing. (Phillip Noyce) made one solid piece of cinema. The image, the editing, the music.. Just WAW. He seemed haunted by the best spy thrillers in the 1960s. The movie looks accordingly huge and grand. So how come that this is a bad thing? In fact, the script it handled let it huge and grand on the surface, small and embarrassed in the substance!<br/><br/>I admit that the integration's scene at the CIA, put in the trailer and in the movie's start, is just impressive. It promises of smart thriller. The rest smashes this promise into pieces. How many questions were allowed to be asked?! Well, take a list: If Slat is a Russian spy, why to inform the Americans, and by the most risky way ever?! The movie answers that, flimsily, by the Russians' need to a patsy?!! So if Salt is a patsy, why to continue executing operations for whoever deals with her as a patsy? Why not confessing to anyone as long as she became an exposed card already? Why her Russian superiors didn't eliminate her earlier?! It was the top of oddity when Salt pays Orlov a visit later, and tells him about his aging, and not a word about ""Why did you inform about me?!!!"" Then, if she killed all the Russian organization OF WELL TRAINED ASSASSINS (what an unbelievable scene!), then how in god's name the matter wasn't known to the loose guys of the same organization, like the officer who provided the entrance to the white house, and Mr. main spy?!<br/><br/>Add to that, several marks of cheap goods: provocative coincidences; the Russian politician is alive, exactly in the middle of the world's end?! Uncanny points: Why Salt, in her daily life in America, wears contact lens along with fake teeth?! More than that: How come? Did her husband never notice?! Idiot assuming all the time; nobody sees Salt while getting out of the crashed car under the daylight, in the street's center stage! Stupid casting: the American president looked like a silent dummy. Forced moves; salt takes off her panties to block up the CIA surveillance camera, while her jacket was available and - sure - bigger in size! Yet nothing bothered me more than the fabricated happy ending; it took Salt 1 minute chat, and 2 ""You Know Betterrr!"" to convince the CIA agent that she's a Russian spy and good guy in the same time, he got too convinced to the extent that he helped her to escape???!!! By the way, how the helicopter's door got dislocated while that?!! Don't answer this! And finally, aren't Russia, nuclear bomb, soviet spies-old memories from the 1980s? It seemed that the movie was written at least 20 years earlier then got made, very late, without any modifications!<br/><br/>(Angelina Jolie) assured that her little mannish face is iconic and expressive, but alas, that was in the wrong place somehow. Look how she begs the creditability at many scenes, since the written material didn't give her any. Look how she's boringly unbeatable. And look at her disguise as a man; it was one of the weirdest at all!<br/><br/>Not some, but all of the action sequences are done superbly. The stunt of jumping over a bridge to a lorry, then to another lorry, did dazzle me particularly. Overall, this movie is a feast of old-fashioned action, something we truly miss in a world of overabundant CGI, and silly flying wires. On the other hand, while being majestic and effective, the music couldn't compensate the lost credibility, rather, it was great long shot.. for emptiness!<br/><br/>It reminds me with a story of a man who went to camping in the wild, with everything might be needed, however after facing the bear, and while being eaten by it, he remembered forgetting a gun. Now (Salt) forgot the factor that could have saved it from being unbelievable nonsense. It's the factor that many Hollywood movies do forget lately: the script. They think that by playing the movie very fast and confident, nobody would notice anything. But being fast and confident didn't save the camping man from his dark fate!<br/><br/>(Salt) is smart thriller visually and sonically, but not mentally. A rare time, and a painful irony, when the ""leave your brain at the door"" movie is tightly made and annoyingly brainless like this.<br/><br/>P.S: The movie was released in theaters in 100 minutes long. However, the director's cut is released with 4 minutes longer, including an alternative ending. So, should I yell HURRAY, dancing out of joy?! No, based on that tricky mode recently, of selling the same movie twice, I find no comment but ""I DON'T CARE!""."

","""Salt"" is about a CIA agent named Evelyn Salt, who seems to have a good, happy life with a nice husband. She's about to go home to her anniversary when a Russian man named Vasilly Orlov, who claims that Salt is actually an undercover Russian spy. Her colleagues, Ted Winters and Peabody, become more than a little suspicious. This is not helped when Evelyn's husband goes missing. She goes running for her life, trying to find her husband and clear her name.<br/><br/>Or is she? I like how the plot is never quite where you think it is going. A lot of critics have complained about how the plot is very predictable. Personally, I have no idea what they are talking about. ""Salt"" is mostly an old-fashioned action thriller that evokes memories of the Cold War; you're never sure who to trust. I also liked how director Philip Noyce utilized Bourne-esque shaky-cam and rapid editing without making the action incoherent. He knows how to put the techniques to good use. The action is pretty good, but not necessarily adrenaline-pumping. Some of the action set pieces are a little derivative, but I didn't mind. Sometimes the film borrows from ""Mission: Impossible,"" ""24,"" the Bourne movies, ""The Matrix Reloaded,"" and at one point even ""Spider-man!"" But again, I didn't mind.<br/><br/>What I did mind, though, is Evelyn Salt herself. Angelina Jolie is pretty good in the role (and looks damn fine!), but her character is boring. Evelyn Salt is not given much of a personality and is so blandly written that I never truly cared about or rooted for her. Without a well-developed lead character, I was never truly invested in the story, and as a result the film simply was never as much fun as it should have been. This affects the action as well. As I said before, the action scenes are entertaining, but not exactly spectacular. One of the keys to making a truly exciting action film is making sure the lead character(s) is developed enough to care about. But since I was never interested in Evelyn Salt, the action was merely diverting at best.<br/><br/>Oh, and there's one more thing that got on my nerves (spoiler alert!). There is one character who was not what he/she appeared to be. That twist is a serious eye roller, comes out of nowhere, and is just ridiculous. That was where I finally lost it.<br/><br/>If I sound like I hated this film, I didn't. It manages to be mildly entertaining, but a bland lead character and lame last-minute twist kept me from really enjoying it.<br/><br/>Grade: C+ Rating: 6/10"

You don't even have to get near them, you just shoot them with a tranq gun. Now transporting them will take a couple more guys to carry, but now they can't get away and kill and cause undue carnage in the process. Let's face it-this is a pretty good movie plot wise-with the brainwashing of kids to become Russian agents in the future. Not original but well done nonetheless. But of course if the good guys were to tranq all the dangerous people they captured; which I am assuming they do, because that only makes sense; then we have no movie. And since tranqs have been around for many many years, it would ruin thousands of movies that have this in the plot. So just like another reviewer said, these movies are not realistic, even though they portray themselves as ultra real. It is pretty scary to think that any country could do this though!!!!"

","""That is it?"" That was my reaction at the end of this movie. Where to begin? Well, the movie does give a promising start. But that's all it gives. It got me well interested, even though I thought that I have seen this type of movie a hundred times. But somehow, that type of scenario (falsely accused - one against all - twist in the story - the good guy clears his name at the end) just can't get boring. This is a rare case where the writers tried to do something different, but failed miserably. There are so many twists from the very beginning that one can get quite tired at the middle of the movie. The finale of the movie is interesting but a bit annoying, because of the twists before it. That is what the whole movie is about: twists. The movie would have been much better if set in the time of the cold war, or even in the time of McCarthy's witch hunt. But due to the environment it was actually set in (present day), we're just not able to say that the scenario is possible. The rapid infiltration of characters that have, very little, or no role at all, is just confusing. The paranoia that the movie gives makes one feel as thou everybody in the movie could be the enemy (and that is the only thing why I gave the movie a passing grade). The movie ends abruptly and without much idea of what could come next. Jolie is great, but I did get the feeling she, at some point, understood that the script is terrible and did a routine job (which is not half of what she is capable of). The movie is interesting, a one night-action flick that evaporates from your head after two days. Watch it without much expectation and you just might have a good time."

","This is a very nice movie that will keep you hooked with the story. You even start guessing the reasons behind some of the stupid decisions made, like for example: <br/><br/>Salt states that she ""is not who the Koreans think she is"", and that she just works for some oil company. That's fine. We even see her later working inside an Oil company. Later on, not only do we know that this building is a CIA center, but also a Russian defect spy also knows about it because he turned himself in in that building. Maybe he surrendered somewhere else and was brought there, but that was not handled correctly.<br/><br/>And why would Orlov go to the CIA building in the first place? Would it not be easier if he could somehow isolate Salt and give her the Green Light for the operation she was programmed for when she was a little kid? I mean, why would he want the CIA to be alert about the operation which is supposed to be ""secret/confidential""? Having the CIA's run after them would slow if not abort their mission. What purpose does his presence in the CIA building serve other than EXPOSITION to the viewer which can be done tons of other ways better than here.<br/><br/>Also, when salt is about to ""kill"" the Russian VIP, she points her gun at him, and the camera cuts to somewhere else, and then we hear a gunshot, and we assume she killed him. When in fact she just injected him with a spider venom. Did she need to point the gun at him? I mean, it is not like she told him: ""I'm gunna inject you with this stuff. If you refuse, I will shoot you!"". If that is the case, then why the GUNSHOT? It is like the director really wanted the viewer to be a stupid and assume that she killed him. Even when the agents arrive later and find him ""dead"" they don't say he is dead. We don't see any gunshot wound, they simply say ""I can feel a pulse"", because if they said ""he is dead"" then the plot twist might not work later. What a messy way to plant a plot twist.<br/><br/>Another issue: I can believe that she went inside the white house disguised as a NATO officer, and she does look like a man, but her voice is still feminine! That should have been more than enough to raise suspicion. Also, she was wearing a bullet proof vest, and that did not show up on the security scanning! Way unlikely (But then again, she might have gain access to a vest later, after she went inside). <br/><br/>This scene, however, make it very clear to you that the lead character for this film was intended for a man. They just couldn't work around changing the gender, and re-writing the script appropriately. <br/><br/>This is my first REALLY LONG review and I hope you have though of the same points that I have raised. If so, and you have answers, please share them at ahmad.mutawa (at) gmail.com<br/><br/>I give this movie 5 out of 10 just because I was never bored when I watched it.

The title character is presented as a superwoman who can overcome any obstacle in her way, which may be empowering for females, but removes any suspense when she is in dangerous situations, as we begin to see that she cannot be stopped. By the end of the film, Jolie's character resembles the Terminator more than a human being. Jumping from one extended, over-the-top set piece to the next, the viewer is dragged along on a visually exciting roller-coaster ride filled with impossible loops and turns that is forgotten as soon as it is over. Occasionally thrilling, but more often had me shaking my head in disbelief. To add insult to injury, once again we have a film without a proper ending, leaving the door open for sequels. Hooray."

Now, I'm not here to trash Salt, yes its silly, yes its not as clever as it thinks it is but ultimately , its one of the better action films that Angelina has appeared in. Whats frustrating about Angelina Jolie in action films is not that she doesn't make the character believable, the contrary, you can tell she's committed and full throttle in every scene and her off screen enigmatic persona really adds a layer of intrigue when she plays characters like this, no its that the scripts often let her down. In Tomb Raider she was every inch Lara Croft but the films stank. In Wanted she played the calm, cool hard faced assassin to perfection while matching the boys in the physical action stakes, but the film was awful. In Mr And Mrs Smith, she played it for laughs with some strong action set pieces thrown in but the film didn't have the legs. Time after time, Angelina is let down by those around here not being up to her level. Salt, while being one of better action films (not saying much) is still bogged down by over indulging itself, throwing twists in for twists sakes.In a way, it feels like the film is a few years too late and we've seen the same twists done so many times ,we are fully expecting them.

","I had no high hopes due to this being an angelina jolie poseur movie, maybe expected just a bit more due to IMDb's 6.5 rating but was tricked (again). the upside is that this is definitely the last one of these kinds I take a chance on.<br/><br/>the plot has the expected twists and villains and whatnot and while it's no gem it's not awful. but what kills movies like this for me is seeing some 5""7' 110lb stick-armed girl manhandling groups of hefty police officers and other assorted villains one after another, walking around with her pretend ""I'm so cool"" scowl. it's just too stupid to take.<br/><br/>yes all of Hollywood is in fantasy-land and movies are supposed to be a fun escape but there is such a thing as being too over-the-top ridiculous. ever since the 1990s and latent title 9-inspired activism, Hollywood and its insatiable political correctness have been on some fantasy kick that girls with pipecleaner arms are as fearsome as anyone else in unarmed combat. sure, whatever Hollywood.<br/><br/>the point is, the distraction of such intentional idiocy keeps one from actually paying attention to the movie. most of the time I was watching this I kept thinking ""would a guy action hero in this role still have stunk up the theater?"" I don't really know but tbh I'd rather just watch a mindless movie like this instead of constantly being annoyed by ""this is so effin stupid I can't believe it""."

","Got this from Redbox after it was recommended to me by brother-in-law.<br/><br/>Quite frankly, it sucked a big one. While I don't expect action thrillers to have that much in the way of plot evolution, this movie was to the point of ludicrous. With its multiple twists, do you really expect a sane individual to even get into the flick? By the time half of the movie was over, my wife and I were laughing at the defiance of the law of physics and ridiculous plot convolutions that it made a Bollywood film look like ""Hamlet"". And worst still, it takes itself too seriously.<br/><br/>Angelina Jolie is quickly becoming the female ""Nicholas Cage"", acting in stupid flicks with stupid plots while giving her silly pouts; worse yet, she has good potential as a good actress, as seen in ""Gia"" or even ""Changeling"". Direction is competent, but I was surprised to see Philip Noyce (""Patriot Games"", ""Rabbit Proof Fence"") directed, since he has done better films in the past. When I found out Kurt Wimmer (""Equilibrium"", ""Ultraviolet"") wrote it, I finally figured out why this was a stupid flick to begin with. The rest of the cast, while potentially good, went wasted.<br/><br/>Please don't waste your money on this garbage. Hollywood, please stop wasting money on trash like this."

If a state catch a spy, I don't't think it's torturers couldn't speak English so well, or that the 'homeland' would bring a civilian to the prisoner swap. Then your good (wo)man will be detained because of some nobody comes in and tell that she is a double agent. Then he, the nobody kills two man in the elevator in the CIA HQ/office, after that, he walks out like nothing happened, no alarm. Then you, the double agent like agent escape - full alarm not a problem -, go home (bare footed), pack your stuff, leave home wall-climbing style (bare foot).

","Some have ventured a feeble defense of this tripe on the ""action movies aren't supposed to be realistic"" line. Well, true. But they're not supposed to be preposterous either, and utterly abandon the rules of physics and biology. I might buy a man in the role, if he was young, had a special forces background and was clearly in shape and had a fierce combat mindset. Yes, it would still be absurd but it would at least be within spitting distance of the possible, and protected by genre tradition. This movie turns on an extremely thin (and thin-boned, even spidery framed) woman of about 110 pounds outfighting highly trained, armed and armored professional operatives, sometimes three and four at a time, TIME AND TIME AGAIN. Did I also tell you that to preserve her presence on the good side of the spectrum, she can ONLY KNOCK THEM OUT. Oh, and she can jump off a moving subway without SHATTERING HER SPINE OR SMUDGING HER MAKE-UP. Best gimmick: to disguise herself she DIES HER HAIR BLACK. She's still one of the most beautiful women in the world, but no one notices her, despite A NATIONAL MANHUNT, because she's now got black hair. Oh, and when she's cornered she (SPOILER) BUILDS AN INSTANT BAZOOKA out of common cleaning supplies in 8 seconds. The plot is snippets from superior works--The Manchurian Candidate, The Day Before Midnight, The Bourne Trilogy, Dr. Strangelove, among others--haphazardly arranged, not even consistent by its own interior (if crazed) logic. Just pointless. They should have used that bazooka on the script"

It still does not diffuse from the fact, that the script is weak at best! <br/><br/>But what is not weak, is the action choreography. It is shot very nicely. So if you are looking for a movie to pass the time, with enough tension and suspense, with a great lead actress, you could do worse than choose this movie.

","Tony Stark (aka Ironman) may have ultra-efficient aide 'Pepper' Potts but it seems that the CIA has super skilled agent Evelyn Salt (presumably an allusion to the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks). The eponymous role in this spy caper is taken by Angelina Jolie who is prettier than James Bond or Jason Bourne but, in spite of being so much smaller and slighter, no less proficient if we are to believe what we see. So we have plenty of running and kicking and shooting in an action-filled movie from Australia director Phillip Noyce who has previously given us a couple of Jack Ryan adventures.<br/><br/>The problem is that Kurt Wimmer's script is simply sizzle without the sausage and no amount of salt can make up for that. The plot - which ignores the end of the Cold War - is preposterous and full of huge implausibilities and impossibilities while the dialogue is leaden, so that the twist is telegraphed well in advance. There are three versions of this film: the theatrical one (which I saw) plus the director's version and the extended version.

What is sensational and exciting about Salt (aside from Angelina's performance) is the relentless pace, the fact that the story is so devoted to being action and nothing else, no room for other issues (the query the film raise ""Is the Cold War really over"" is handled in a very unlikely manner). What prevents Salt from being up to the Bourne episodes is certainly the total unlikeliness, as it's only about action, though very well rendered and staged."

","Salt is half a movie. The first forty minutes have elements that work in an action film and the last fifty is an inadequate mess.

The audience gets to learn quickly that she's a tough gal. Yet Jolie's character is not a significant figure as she is no different from any other female spy character. In other words Jolie plays Salt like she plays any other character such as the Tomb Raider or Fox.<br/><br/>There are a lot of plot twists in Salt that drove the movie to a mess. The plot twists are not predictable but it's not well thought out and at every turn, it leads to me caring less about the film altogether.<br/><br/>The action sequences are well done. The chase scene was the greatest part of the whole film and the stunts were done terrific. This is the only strong part of this film if any and is the most memorable. The movie quickly turns into a brutal kills that are rather unpleasant than entertaining. The scene where Salt uses handcuffs to strangle Winter is bloody in a bad sense and is bottom material. It makes the film look unprofessional.<br/><br/>The climax doesn't feel like a climax and I never knew it was until the movie was over. As far as the ending goes, I was actually surprised. It was a cliffhanger and I was torn and confused but slightly glad that it was all over.<br/><br/>The dialog is dumb especially in the ending because the characters seem to do different things from what they actually say, not in a character sense but in the sense that the screenplay is badly written.<br/><br/>Salt wasn't supposed to be art but it wasn't a great popcorn movie either.

","Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie) is a very respected CIA agent, until one day a Russian spy comes in and accuses Salt of being a Russian spy, which passes the lie detector test as truthful. Knowing that she will soon be captured by the CIA, and that her husband may be in danger, Salt goes on the run to find her husband, who is not answering any calls. Ted Winter (Liev Schrieber) does not believe the test that she is lying, but some of the things Salt is doing begin to make him suspect her. And everyone begins to ask ""Who is Salt?"" <br/><br/>The acting in this film was good, not Oscar worthy or anything, but overall the acting by everyone was good. Angelina Jolie did good as usual, it was not a perfect performance and she has done much better before, but it was still good. I really liked Liev Schrieber in the film, I saw him first in Defiance, which I really enjoyed his performance in that one as well. Though it seems to me that Angeline Jolie has played characters like this many times before, and to me it is getting pretty old, and the movies are getting pretty bad. The last movie I really enjoyed from her was Changeling.<br/><br/>Now, pretty much everything else about the movie I thought was pretty terrible. The character development just was not good at all, by the end of the movie I honestly didn't care what happened, and I was not even sure who I wanted to win. The action scenes were unbelievably unrealistic, and that was not at an understatement. Instead of saying ""Wow!"" during the action sequences like you should during an action film, I found myself saying ""What?"" during the action scenes. And now we come to the plot. The acting really almost saved this film, because the plot was really, really bad. Unrealistic can be good sometimes, but in this case it is not. I also think some people might find this film boring, I know a lot of the people I was with seeing it did, and I really didn't find it too interesting. But that was good because it kept us from the action scenes.<br/><br/>Overall, Salt is an action movie that many people will like due to the cast, and pretty much everyone loves a good action film every once in awhile. But I think many will find Salt boring, and way too unrealistic to spend money on, so I am going to have to against Roger Ebert here, which I hate to do, and say that to be honest I just didn't really like this movie."

","I wasn't sure what to expect from this. With that said, I do what I can to give credit where it is due, and if something is well-done, no matter what, I will try to convey that it is, and why it is. First off, if you like conspiracy theories, you may very well like this plot(oh, and don't think about it much, it'll fall apart). There are a lot of twists(so many that at the end, you feel without any grounding). I think this is because Kurt Wimmer wrote it; and I think it would have helped immensely if someone else had helped with the action scenes, because I think they would have fared better in a stylized picture(like the ones he directs), instead of the somewhat realistic approach here(the two cause obvious conflict; it doesn't help that the speed of the martial arts gives up on trying to compete with the likes of Bourne from the get-go), and honestly, only about half of it is effective, and very little of it is downright memorable or outstanding. This is not his fault, I would say(Ultraviolet proves that he can craft amazing sequences, and I'm watching Equilibrium as soon as I can). He was an inappropriate choice for the tone. Noyce isn't bad(and he can certainly do one of these well when Tom Clancy is at least partially responsible for the source material), and we know he can deliver a popcorn flick that'll last the duration(and to an extent that is what happens here; this is intense, and I was never bored... not everything excites, though). The real issue is the lack of characters that you can really cling onto; yes, you spend this trying to figure out if Salt is ""good"" or ""evil"", and we're thus not sure who to root for. You can get away with anti-heroes, but ones that you have no idea about *for the entire thing*, that's going over the line. Dialog varies, most of the attempts at being clever fail. It doesn't help that the concept is hopelessly outdated. There are pretty cool guns in this. The chasing is excessive and often feels like it goes nowhere. Editing and cinematography is nice enough, and the hand-held is kept to a fitting amount. Music is appropriate. Acting is great, especially Jolie(who, in spite of being skinny, looks hawt) who truly does provoke emotional response, and to a slightly lesser extent, Schreiber. I like that they don't use ridiculous gadgets, and the spy-stuff has moments. The disguises somehow consist entirely of dyed hair, coloured contact lenses and/or a hat/clothes. There is a little moderate swearing, bloody violence and disturbing content in this. I recommend this to those who very badly want to see a chick kick ass(me, I'll keep my fingers crossed for more genuinely excellent ones like that). 6/10"

","Angelina Jolie can't keep away from the action flicks! And that's no bad thing I suppose. Excluding Tomb Raider(s) which I thought were horrific, she's at the top of the league table when it comes to female action stars. Granted that league table isn't exactly huge either!<br/><br/>This time round, Angie plays Evelyn Salt who works for the CIA . For one reason or another, this movie opens with Salt held hostage in China and she is only released after her husband rallies for her release. Salt eventually goes back to work and on the day she is rushing to leave for her anniversary dinner (cheesynot the dinner, but a cliché surely) a defector walk's in. Said Defector is interrogated by Salt who informs her that a sleeper agent is about to wake up and kill a few important folk. Not long after this insightful piece of dialogue, he goes on to say that the sleeper spy is called Evelyn Salt. OMG!!! DRAMMMMAA! Her superiors in the CIA decide to have a bit of chat about the said allegation and Salt decides to go on the run, particularly after she can't get in contact with her husband. Throw in a few set pieces and one or two slightly predictable twist's and you get Salt! <br/><br/>Jolie is pretty solid throughout and her on screen colleagues namely Liev Schrieber are also pretty solid and likable. Some of the set piece's are pretty impressive and the movie ploughs along quite quickly and your never quite left hanging around in its 90 odd minute running time. That said, the one thing that bothered me more than anything else, was Angie's hair color. It just doesn't look right!!! Salt is not going to be the best actioner you'll see as it does get bland at times, but it's little twists, predictable as they might be, and set pieces do provide some form of entertainment. While Salt might need some pepper from time to time, it's not a bad movie and is very watchable."

","Salt! First of a trilogy! Pepper coming out next, along with Mustard the following year. Average spy thriller and I could've told anyone that from watching the trailers. Bourne trilogy was always going to be a tough act to follow. And now with this, it's like they haven't even tried! Casino Royale and The Bourne series are probably the best spy movies to come out in the last decade. You'd be hard pressed to findanything as good as those movies. But now we have Salt, Angelina's newspy movie which promises be every bit as good as Bourne and then some. It just wasn't that great of a movie! Actually, to be honest with you the story wasn't that bad. What else? Some of the action scenes were quite impressive, but the fight scenes looked like the were choreographed by Vinnie Jones with a bit of Chuck Norris in Walker Texas Ranger. Hard to believe a 5ft 8', 140lb woman is able to beat up so many people with a couple of karate chops. Not realistic enough. Oh and the film was very predictable. Even with all the twists and turns I knew exactly what was going to happen and who was behind what. Acting wise, decent performances from the supporting cast. Chiwetel Ejiofor continues to climb the ladder with another notch on his CV. Liev Schreiber continues to be reliable and does a job and then there's Angelina, who actually does a good job as Salt. All in all, Salt is worth the release but at times plays more like a video game than an action thriller. If you're an Angelina fan go and see it and let herhynotise you with those blue eyes. If you aren't, this is another rainy day Saturday nighter on DVD."
"Robert_duder","7","0","2","18 August 2010"," Take it with a grain of....ha was that bad?
","Salt seemed to have a lot of buzz around it. Mysterious, action packed and fan boys were cooing about seeing it. So I guess I had decent expectations. It was an action film and Angelina Jolie has done them well enough and it had the Bourne angle and feel to it so it should have been exceptional but I think many will agree with me, including the box office numbers that it just turned out to be okay and almost completely forgettable the minute the credits rolled. It isn't a bad film, it entertains for the run time but it really doesn't get the adrenaline rolling, the characters don't truly draw you in and it doesn't have any sort of unique quality that will put it heads and tails above the slew of summer blockbuster. The unfortunate part is that it does try to have a quality in the twisted mysterious story but it takes so many twists and turns and doesn't always feel like it works or that it is making sense. The action scenes are kind of tame and for a summer blockbuster you can't have tame entertainment. I guess kudos should be given because they do really try to give the film a smart, twisty, psychological, and political story.<br/><br/>Angelina Jolie is a good actress. I've seen her do some good roles and some bad roles but it seems like in the last five or so years she rests on the laurels that she is Angelina Jolie and that is all that matters. She just doesn't seem to put any meat into the role. She seems almost bored at times and while we know she can do stunts and action she doesn't seem to hit her stride as Salt. Liev Schreiber could have been truly great in this role and instead he is just good, or even okay. The plot and script don't seem to really give him a lot of character to play with but he is still good in the role. Him and Jolie could have great chemistry but again it is just good. Polish actor Daniel Olbrychski should have been a much stronger villain and I think he could have done well but once again...you see the pattern...the story doesn't give him the reigns to be truly great. The supporting cast can all be given the same review that they are likely a great ensemble but the film isn't strong enough to support them. I think they rested on the fact that they had a solid cast and the story would evolve around them but I think that rarely works (don't tell that to The Expendables cast.) <br/><br/>At first glance some would say Kurt Wimmer is a great writer have penned some really big films in the last few years but when you start to look at what those films COULD have been you'll see where Salt stumbles. I've seen seven of his twelve penned movies and every one of them I would say...yah it was good BUT imagine what it could have or should have been. I think Wimmer rushes his scripts. Phillip Noyce is no slouch at directing either but I think it relies on the script. He directed two terrific Jack Ryan films in the 90's, and also some good TV in his career. I just noticed while writing this review that they are talking a Salt sequel and I'm okay with that but please lets see some real depth to the characters and a more solid well laid out story. So lets sum all of this up, Salt was not a bad film. It entertained me just fine. But it wasn't amazing and it didn't blow me away and I didn't leave the theater hopped up on adrenaline like an action movie should make me feel. I wanted more. And unfortunately I put much of the blame of writer Kurt Wimmer but then he is the one talking sequel so we might get more of the same in 2012-ish. 7/10"

","SALT – CATCH IT ( B ) From the promos we all knew that it's all about Angelina Jolie + Action + No-Substance and fortunately or unfortunately all three things came true. Salt starts with the bang and the banging doesn't stop during all 1OO minutes. I think there was a strong story but director didn't gave much thought to it and just try to cover the whole movie with action rather then emotions and substance. If he would have given a slight thought to the provocative substance he had in the script then this movie could have been another ""Bourne Identity trilogy"" for Hollywood. Anyways the only thing that saves the movie from sinking is Angelina Jolie and its not that her acting was powerful, but actually she was pretty plain on emotions even when her husband gets killed in front of her, for whom she does everything in the movie. In fact just watching her doing all the cool stunts makes it worthy of watching plus the story is little complicated so you want to know what's actually happening. All other actors were just there and said their dialogues. Overall a very clumsy movie yet Angelina Jolie Rocked it!"
"horlicksng","6","0","2","15 August 2010"," Who is Salt?
","My Score: 6.0/10 Who is Salt? Being attracted by this tag line and Angelina Jolie, I had a go for this movie with my friends.<br/><br/>""Salt"" was directed by Phillip Noyce, the director who cooperated with Angelina Jolie and Denzel Washington in ""The Bone Collector"". This movie was about a spy war between USA and Russia, and a CIA agent Evelyn Salt (starred by Angelina Jolie) held a key role behind a mysterious plot called ""Day-X"", which involved assassination of the Russia President during his visit to the States. During an incident, Salt was being accused as a double agent, so she needed to flee in order to find out the truth as well as look for her missing husband.<br/><br/>As a spy movie, audience may expect to watch some ""Bourne-series"" action. However I would say, this movie does not deliver successfully in a way it may want it to be. The plot was obvious right in the beginning so my friends and I quickly knew who was the biggest bad guy at the end, and to our disappointment we were right. The twists in the movie were easily expected so that didn't create many surprises. The dialogues were rather cliché and... some parts just do not make any sense.<br/><br/>The plus sides of the movie would be the well-designed action scenes and Angelina herself. It was enjoyable watching these two elements. Entertaining overall but don't expect to watch a very intelligent spy war in this movie."
"honorhorror","8","0","2","9 August 2010"," Salt: Let's pretend.
","Let's play an interesting game. First, let's pretend we are Americans, and now we need a politically right evaluation on Evelyn Salt. Hands down our final evaluation showed that she's highly emotional, sensitive therefore even she's a female Jason Bourne minus the amnesia, she still stands for the basic ingredients of humanity, that all she did in the entire movie was for her husband, which provided the very soul of the Salt character. Without this love for her husband, Salt wouldn't have gone rogue on her Russian superiors. Therefore, the American values again prevailed, saved itself from within, that everyone deserve to preserve human loves. This is something that would never become a part of the calculation of Russian red baddies.<br/><br/>Let's pretend again, that we are Russian red baddies. Now we need a politically right evaluation on Evelyn Salt, or comrade Chenkov. Name: Agent Chenkov, alias Evelyn Salt. Identity: Russian super spy(or Super Russian Spy). Status: Defected. Reason of defection: decades of corruption from evil Western Capitalism and so-called humanism. Although our top cognitive trainer and personality-modification specialist had brainwashed her 100 times during her childhood, we can still only control the time of her activation. Our opponents, the top USA brain-washing specialists had inserted a fail-safe program into her, a husband. Therefore, whenever we activate her, the evil USA had ensured she 100% goes rogue upon activation because of the death of husband. Evaluation Conclusion: more authenticated brainwash mechanism needed. Ho ho ho! <br/><br/>Had fun reading my evaluations? So did I. Now comes a more interesting question for die-hard secularists:which evaluation do you like to believe? That's because, if we choose to believe the Russian's, just like a lot of post-modernists believed that humans, on earth, are only puppets of ideological projections and biochemical reactions, we would have to accept the logical conclusion that Russian baddies are just quantitatively inferior to USA, and someday they are gonna come up with this more authenticated brainwash mechanism which no Americans can hide from. That comes to my point, that my USA side of evaluation, though pervasive in illustration, provided some truth on some level.<br/><br/>In Timothy Keller's ""The Reason For God"", the author had come up with this intriguing argument as a response to the staggering individualism that ""is there anyone in the world right now doing things you believe they should stop doing no matter what they personally believe about the correctness of their behavior?"" All those, who until the last minute, believed everyone has the right to decide what's right and wrong for himself/herself, has to say, ""yes"". In return, Mr. Keller would ask them to reflect on if there's some common moral reality that is there not decided by any individuals but by the divine holiness. In my opinion, Salt is a very similar case in which the secularists, post-modernists, liberals can have a good opportunity to think about the very basis for their paradigms. After all, there are too many assumptions for the whistle-blowers to push things in the right direction. That they essentially believe in the American values is just one of these assumptions.<br/><br/>Maybe we can pretend again, that we are actually Russian goodies. Then the evaluation conclusion would be: we admit we have made mistakes, terrible mistakes that stretched human natures too far in violence, cold-bloodiness, etc. Maybe humans have ultimate good ways to follow, ways that are more important than defeating another nation. Maybe even someone as robotic as Salt can still be returned to who she's supposed to be, in God's eyes."

","A decent enough movie. It didn't strike me as anything special though. The action was great, as was Jolie, but overall it was quite uneventful. <br/><br/>I wasn't expecting much from this at all anyway, so it's not like I'm let down or anything, In fact, It was a lot better than I expected it to be. The trailers for this put me off big time. It looked godawful. Fortunately, this wasn't the case. It could've been a lot better, and the first half was definitely the strongest. It started off great, but I really did feel that it lost it's footing half way through.<br/><br/>Nothing awful, but nothing fantastic either. I'll go and see the sequel though. This was a fun enough ride."
"Eternality","5","0","4","6 August 2010"," Salt is one of the most preposterous movies of the year and you would be better off giving it a miss.
","Who is Salt? The tagline of Philip Noyce's new film asks. Don't bother to find out because the answer is irrelevant. Angelina Jolie plays Evelyn Salt, a highly-skilled spy who works for the CIA, or does she not? Let me say it again: Angelina Jolie plays Evelyn Salt, a highly-skilled spy who works for Russian intelligence, or does she not? There you see, the answer is not relevant. What you do need to know is this: Salt is one of the most preposterous movies of the year and you would be better off giving it a miss.<br/><br/>Well-known for the emotionally potent ""stolen generation"" drama Rabbit-Proof Fence (2002), and films like The Quiet American (2002), and Dead Calm (1989), Noyce is an Australian director whose considerable talent has not been allowed to shine as brightly as he would have wished after he joined Hollywood in the early 1990s, making sub-par Tom Clancy adaptations like Patriot Games (1992), and Clear and Present Danger (1994), and average films such as The Saint (1997), and The Bone Collector (1999).<br/><br/>Jolie is like Franka Potente in Tykwer's Run Lola Run (1998), except that she is running away from authorities trying to arrest her, rather than running to prevent someone from committing a crime. Her performance is adequate for an action picture; she has steely determination and reportedly did most of her own stunts. However, her character traits are only superficially fleshed out. This is the screenplay's fault, which in a moment, I would launch a tirade at its writer.<br/><br/>Salt is generally quite well-directed by Noyce, so it is not entirely his fault that the film fails. To his credit, the action sequences are handled well, and there is some effort in generating suspense. However, they lack credibility. The scene that puts the final nail in believability is that of Jolie hurtling level by level down a lift shaft by jumping towards its corners, in pursuit of an elevator with armed men. And also, how many times have we seen someone in an action film jump onto a moving truck from a bridge ten meters above and suffer no broken bones? So many times that it seems safe enough to try.<br/><br/>Writer Kurt Wimmer, who was responsible for the mess that is Sphere (1998), and Ultraviolet (2006), cannot even tell an average story right, let alone a half-decent one. Salt could have been an action-thriller with a clever plot, something like a spy reworking of Andrew Davis' The Fugitive (1993). Alas, the result is a story that excites as much as a trip to the grocery store. The motivations of Jolie's character are never known, which is always a bad thing for action films because actions are responses to motivations.<br/><br/>Is she a double-agent? A triple-agent? Or heck, an agent within an agent? There is no impetus to really look for an answer. Stay away from this, pass the pepper instead.<br/><br/>SCORE: 4.5/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!"
"i-phil","6","0","3","4 August 2010"," Very American cinema
","What is so displeased Russia America? Super spies attempt to destroy peace in the world, the destruction of America - this is not just trying to make a Russian in the film Salt. Russian in the film are shown only with a bad hand. It turns out that in Soviet times was founded a sect of young children, who will become in the future spies. They are sending in America in infancy, they must have lived there all my life, to introduce American government and then destroy the country from within. Evelyn Salt, its other name is just hysterical laughter, was a member of the underground organization. But these bastards, I mean Russian, took away from it all and she moved to the side of America. The scene with the kiss the ring of conventional pioneers brought laughter not only from me but have a good half of cinema.<br/><br/>I am not familiar with the filmography good picture. I can not judge well whether he is shooting a film. But this movie mediocre in terms of directing work. History in the beginning, or, as it now called the memories of heroes - flashbacks plunged into laughter as a father. Russian shows some sects of young spies. They have one leader, and all members of this organization is constantly kiss his ring. Such was our country during the Soviet Union? You can not, fellow Americans, so bad things about our country, it is a shame for you. The very same story a little unclear. Salt First one, then another, and then a third person. Its actions are somehow illogical for such a fighter. She is one selected from the buildings, overcrowded special forces, even knowing that her hunt. By itself, the genre of action in the film is realized on average. Fights, shootings, car chases - all looks, but not with pleasure. There is a movie in which this component is developed much better. Direction - 3. Entertainment - 4. Story - 2.<br/><br/>Actors in the film is perfect, but very few of them play in all its force. Neither Jolie nor Shvayber not try. But if Angelina knows how to play well everywhere, it looks pretty Liv is not believable. The worst actor of the movie I want to recognize the man who played the role of President of America. At a ridiculous look. An expression of surprise on his face in the end caused a violent reaction laughter watching the movie. Actors - 6.<br/><br/>A special place in the movie I want to give characters. Salt in my opinion she not decided for whom she is. The scene with the dog said she loved America, but with a kiss the ring - Russia. But she opened not all of its secrets. Her memories of her husband seem illogical and out of place. Not much it grieved when he lost it. Images of the Russian came up with the most stupid writers. The names of Russian mediocre. President Boris Matveev. Who? Do you have that little imagination. And the names of Russian spies in general is laughable. Scene Salt return to their Russian brothers - ""a masterpiece"". This point clearly shows that America did not understand multifaceted Russian soul. Vodka - this is not important in Russia, remember that! President of Russia re elected for a couple of hours. As a fast, does not it? Coffin of the old president has not yet brought to Russia as the new already read the introductory speech. None of the characters never fully revealed. It is because of the lack of completion of certain plot lines and characters never solved, I put such a low estimate. Characters - 1.<br/><br/>Very Americanized film show the real attitude of Americans to the Russian co-brothers. Very silly, illogical and wrong brought by the movie. A bad summer blockbuster. I hope that will not continue. This film will certainly enjoy in America, but not every Russian loves this nonsense. Misspent."
"jojo_ismal","5","0","3","1 August 2010"," Salt Wanted?
","I am a huge fan of Angelina Jolie. But only for her drama characters I guess. I watched Gia, Changeling, Mr. & Mrs. Smith and even Life or Something Like It. She doesn't have the most excellent body of work compared to the like of Kate WInslet or Cate Blanchett but her charisma in every role cannot be denied. <br/><br/>Angie is said the perfect cast for a female lead in a action movie. No contest to that. What she did in Wanted has sealed that title. But to my disappointment, Salt does not live up to the depth and edge Fox has shown us in Wanted.<br/><br/>I could not helped myself from comparing Angie's role in Salt and Wanted. Both had their histories told thru flashbacks but my dear Salt, the flashback is like high school kids narrated by their teacher in the time tunnel. i did cringe listening to the Russian guy's narration accompanied by the ever implausible old footages. I can even hear laughter from several audiences in the cinema.<br/><br/>Then we have the actions. I agreed with several reviews, the camera zoom every time Angie make her punches and kicks annoyed the hell of me. It made me dizzy and it made the actions partially visioned. lack of satisfaction there for an action-craver like me. <br/><br/>Again, we can see resemblances to Wanted from some of the actions. Salt crawling on the semi vs Fox crawling on train (the music score was sounded similar too!). Salt detonating the Russians by the river vs Wesley detonating the assassins head-q (using rats of course!). These deja vu doesn't help me liking Salt at all. <br/><br/>and yeah. 10 mins after the movie started, I knew that Liev's Ted Winter wud be the villain as well, but credit to him, the best scene for me was when Salt decapitate him using the (on-purpose?) lengthy chain. <br/><br/>Overall, my major problem was how Salt reminded me of Wanted but i'm still hoping for a knock-out sequel for Angie's sake. :)"

","I can't say the film was engaging from the start even though it mindlessly jumps in to the action almost immediately. It does get better as the film unfolds, however. A lot of what appears to make no sense whatsoever actually does by the time the film concludes. Some plot points still don't add up and the canvas of the film is too epic for its own good... wild and unbelievable assassination plots against the big gun leaders of the world. Angelina apparently possesses superpowers they never explain because no human (female or male) could possibly do what she does in the film. Another problem that plagues the film is the fact that they never really establish Angelina's character enough to empathize with her. Did anyone not see the ""plot twist"" coming a mile away??? The action is intense and there is some intrigue but everything comes across as generic in every way."
"MOOVYZ","7","0","5","26 July 2010"," 9.0 for Angelina as an Action Sta -r 5.0 for Horrible Writing
","OK, where to start... I had positive expectations before going to the theater. Both because of decent reviews and as a fan of Jolie's ability and previous work. There's no denying the girl can act. And she's one of the most alluring females on the planet.<br/><br/>I can't say I loved the ""Tomb Raider"" movies because they were what they were... summer popcorn flicks. The action in those was certainly not believable but it was fun. Having Jolie do most of her own stunt works in those helped tremendously but they were certainly over the top and expected to be so.<br/><br/>I was very surprised at how much I enjoyed ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" when it came out. The banter, the humor and the sexiness of the movie all combined into a thoroughly enjoyable experience. Again, a summer popcorn movie.<br/><br/>Last year, it was ""Wanted"". Not a Jolie vehicle per se, but again summer escapism.<br/><br/>So I kind of had expectations of that type of movie. And coupled with the reviews, I thought i would walk out of the theater with a similar opinion.<br/><br/>""Salt"" began in a similar vein but right away I could see that they were going to use Jolie's talents as an actress as well as an Action Heroine. And it didn't take long for the action to start. (I won't go into deep story lines as so many of the reviews on here cover that) An escape from CIA offices and a somewhat unbelievable chase sequence stoked the beginning but I was very impressed with how much Jolie brought to the role in terms of character. There is a scene near the end of the chase (where she is crouched behind a parked car)that screams intensity and believability as Jolie's character professes her innocence. I mean, she really nailed this scene in terms of conveying fear and anxiety over her dilemma.<br/><br/>But then the bad writing took over. The movie became one long ""aw, c'mon... she wouldn't do that"" after another. Throughout, Angelina brought depth and believability to the role but the very ""over-the-top"" implausibilities became a complete distraction.<br/><br/>I walked out of the movie torn. I really thought Jolie was fantastic and she will pave the way for future female action leads. But I felt really cheated that no one came to the aid of the script. Doesn't anyone go to the directors of these films after seeing the dailies and say ""hey, I think we need to make that a bit more logical"". I guess not. And it's not like it would have taken anything away from the movie. Even with an outdated Iron Curtain enemy and some questionable abilities of the heroine, it could have been so much smarter.<br/><br/>I lay the blame for the movie's failures at the hands of the writer initially, but at the director for not asking for re-writes. And that is a shame because Noyce did an exceptional job in pacing and the ""view"". Even the scenes where Jolie is kicking butt, he chose to keep her skinny arms hidden in shirts and jackets and did not throw unrealistic human abilities into her moves. I could in fact believe that she was able to defeat her male foes by well placed kicks and throws.<br/><br/>It is in the style of the Bourne movies. But not nearly as intelligent, and that's not saying a great deal. And it's by no means a cartoon super-hero movie. Anjelina CAN and DOES pull off the role as an action hero. But the movie fails miserably in terms of plausibility of the storyline.<br/><br/>So overall, I'll score it a 7.0. Well below where I'd hoped it would be. Anjelina Jolie surpassed every expectation I had in making me believe the character herself. But the writer and director screwed the pooch in giving her a workable storyline. The movie will do well and there will be a sequel. For that, I'm pleased. It will be difficulty to write a worse plot."

","How do you replace a male action star with a female? I mean sure, you can easily do it with a dramatic role, Glen Close or Meryl Streep could easily pull that off.....but an action movie? When Tom Cruise backed out of the movie, i couldn't understand why they would deciede to change the entire script to fit the role for Ms. Jolie, as opposed to finding another male replacement. However, if one woman could possibly pull off an action roll like this, it is certainly Angelina Jolie.<br/><br/>Well, the first act of the movie is a little boring and predictable....not just because you've seen the trailer and know how it all starts. But because at first, it was alittle hard to swallow the idea that Jolie's character 'Salt' can transform from this sort of bubbly blonde agent, into this total bad ass chick. Not to say that she can pull off being a bad ass, it was more of the storytelling that didn't quiet add up.<br/><br/>However, once this confusing and boring start was over with, the movie really started to take shape and become entertaining. What i thought started out as a ""Fugitive"" rip-off, started to mold into a pretty intense mystery action flick. And as the movie goes on, you start to realize why Jolie was acting so boring at the start. Now i wouldn't go as far as saying it's fantastic. I mean, it is still predictable at some parts, and the dialogue is a little on the cheesy side, but it is summer action flick, and it certainly kept my attention.<br/><br/>Bottom Line.......yeah, it was a pretty nice summer action movie. I mean, it's nothing special, but compared to the other duds that have come out this summer, it was somewhat refreshing. And one things for certain, Jolie can certainly hold her weight in the big boy action movies."
