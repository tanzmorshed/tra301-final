"Flik","10","96","113","4 January 1999"," A Bug's Life: Not Just Art, But Heart
","(originally a response to a movie reviewer who said A Bug's Life was too much, too fast--he was ""dazed and exhausted"" by the visuals, and seemed to ignore the story completely)<br/><br/>Okay, first off, I'm 26 years old, have a job, go to school, and have a fiance'.  So maybe I'm nuts and just really good at hiding it...but not only did I NOT come away from A Bug's Life exhausted or dazed, it wasn't until I saw it the second time that I could even begin to truly appreciate the artistry and humour of the spectacular visuals--because the first time I went to see this movie, I got so wrapped up in the story and the characters that I FORGOT that I was supposed to be sitting there being ""wowed"" by each frame visually.  How can you not empathize with Flik and his road-to-heck-paved-with-good-intentions life?  ""Heck"" indeed, I found myself identifying with that little ant (not to mention some of the other bugs) in a lot more ways than one...and that, in itself, says more to me about what an incredible movie this is than a whole book on its beautiful eye candy. Of course, it's beautiful (every blade of grass, the tree, the rain...).  Of course, what they can do with technology is amazing (you can read their lips! try it!).  But this movie is not just a masterpiece of art and tech, not just an dazzling explosion of movement and color.  No, A Bug's Life would be static if it were all that and no story.  But, I'm glad to say, it's not!  A Bug's Life has real heart.   Yes, there's a lot going on, storyline-wise as well as visually, but that's because the story and characters actually have some depth to them!  Just because it's a kids' movie doesn't mean you should have to turn off your brain at the theatre door--kids are smarter than you think!  Besides that, I think that the PIXAR crew made this for themselves, even before their kids...and it shows, in the amount of heart in has.  This movie is moving, touching, funny, intriguing, and generally engrossing.  The character development in such an ensemble cast is amazing, there's a major amount of character growth, and not just of the main character--so rare in animation and often in movies in general. It doesn't hit you over the head with its points once it's made them--every scene, every frame has a reason in the storyline for being there, and there are no gratuitous shots.  Not always stating explicitly in words exactly what is going on means subtlety, to me, folks; it means not ""dumbing down"" your movie and assuming the audience is stupid, which it mostly is not.  All I can think is, if you can see A Bug's Life and not feel anything at all, then you must have never made a big mistake, hurt your friends, had a crush, fallen in love, been frustrated that no one would listen to you, lied to someone you care about, felt like a social misfit, gotten excited over a new idea, come up with a great idea, had what you thought was a great idea backfire, been awkward one moment and confident the next, felt the pressure of responsibility, stood up for yourself and your loved ones, stood alone against the crowd, felt like a failure, felt like a big success, felt the need to make a difference with your life in the lives of others...well, you get the point.  Final words: A+ rating from me; please, if you're going to see it try to see it in the theatre (pan and scan video is NOT going to work for this movie); if you loved Toy Story you'll most likely love this (PIXAR knows how to make movies with heart); if you do love it see it multiple times or you STILL won't know what you're missing (the amount of detail and subtlety here is considerable); and whenever you're feeling really low, just pretend it's a seed, okay?"

","There is great detail in A Bug's Life. Everything is covered. The film looks great and the animation is sometimes jaw-dropping. The film isn't too terribly orignal, it's basically a modern take on Kurosawa's Seven Samurai, only with bugs. I enjoyed the character interaction however and the bad guys in this film actually seemed bad. It seems that Disney usually makes their bad guys carbon copy cut-outs. The grasshoppers are menacing and Hopper, the lead bad guy, was a brillant creation. Check this one out."

","""A Bug's Life"" is like a favorite candy bar -- it's chock-full of great little bits that add up to something really tasty.<br/><br/>The story couldn't have been better; it's clever, has ""heart"" (emotion), and every character has a nice ""arc"" (a growth or change).  By comparison, the only characters in ""Toy Story"" to have an ""arc"" are Buzz, who learns to love being a toy, and Woody, who overcomes his resentment of Buzz.  There are tons of laughs and cute moments in ""A Bug's Life"".  All of the actors turn in great voice work, and the animation, both the motion and detail, is superb.<br/><br/>This serious movie buff doesn't throw around ""10""s lightly, but this movie certainly deserves the ""10"" I gave it."
"palmer1-320-821321","9","9","9","22 March 2012"," Super Disney Flick!
","""Bugs Life"" was blasted by the critics upon release, springing from the bowels of Disney not too long after the almost identical ""Antz"". However, as a stand-alone movie, it is difficult to fault. The characters and backgrounds are beautifully rendered but still look like computer animations. That might sound stupid but for those who think computer graphics can equal live-action, this film serves to debunk that idea. It does look good, no question, but compare this to the computer wizardry behind Gollum in the ""Lord Of The Rings"" trilogy and you'll see what I'm getting at. This is not much of a criticism though - it would be akin to disliking Scooby Doo (the series) because nobody says ""Zoinks!"" when they're scared.<br/><br/>I must confess, I rather enjoyed this film. It is imaginative and colourful and full of zest and energy - exactly how a kids film should be. The humour is a little on the basic side (dumb insects falling into walls and references to ""poop-poop"") but again, this is what you would expect. Another reason that ""A Bug's Life"" got the cold treatment from critics was because it simply wasn't as entertaining to adults as the ""Toy Story"" films and I'm afraid I agree. But what the film lacks in cross-generational appeal, it makes up for with enthusiasm and story-telling. It does for bugs what The Flintstones did for neolithic cavemen, fitting outsiders into our own everyday lives. Flick, the rebellious ant at the centre of the story, produces telescopes out of grass and water. Piles of rubbish are portrayed as vast cities and the characters, good and bad, behave as we might. Credit for this must go to the top-notch cast of voice actors including Kevin Spacey, David Hyde Pierce, Denis Leary and the others. Probably the only let-down was John Ratzenberger who sounded exactly like Cliff from ""Cheers"". Still, nice to know he's getting work after all these years."
"soranno","Null","22","26","5 November 2002"," An amusing animated fantasy for all ages
","Several of Walt Disney Pictures' best animated films of recent years have been released or distributed through Pixar, an animation studio that specializes in computer generated animation and ""A Bug's Life"", their follow up to the hugely successful ""Toy Story"" ranks as one of the best and funniest Walt Disney Pictures animated films. Released during the same month as a similar computer generated animated film, ""Antz"", ""A Bug's Life"" suffers no bad comparisons because I consider it to be just as good as amusing as ""Antz."" The main focus of the film is Flik, a worker ant who has a very inventive mind and keen eye for detail. He means well but his attempts at helping his fellow ant colony with his ideas and inventions usually cause accidental disaster. One day, the ant colony set up a tribute display for a bad grasshopper named Hopper and his gang but Flik accidentally knocks it down. Hopper is very upset by this and he threatens to kill off the entire colony if they don't build him another provisions pile by the time he inspects the area again. Flik decides to help. He has only a few days to find some ""warrior"" bugs that can stand up to Hopper and his gang. He comes across a group of disgruntled bugs that had just been fired from their gigs at a flea circus. Flik decides to bring them back to the colony and recruit them as warrior bugs. An inventive idea for a children's film with much of the same humor and ideas that helped to make ""Toy Story"" an animated classic."
"Ahmad-4","9","48","62","23 December 1998"," Funniest film in a long time
","This is a FUNNY film. It has all the usual Disney components (music, great range of characters, story, appeal), entwined with superb animation and the excellent voice talents of less well known actors as those in say ""Antz"" and ""Price of Egypt"".<br/><br/>The characters work really well, and have a strong appeal, and the humour is aimed at a wide level which overcomes generational barriers. The movie is also presented in superb cinemascope format, which adds to the cinema experience.<br/><br/>Call me crazy, but I have seen the film three times, and I intend on taking more friends to see it this weekend. Many skeptics have seen this film on my recommendation and not been disappointed. I work in a multiplex, and I can honestly say that no-one has ever walked out of this movie without a sense of satisfaction.<br/><br/>See it, and don't be put off because it is animated. You are sure to enjoy this movie, and make sure you stay for the end credits! The bloopers and out-takes at the end are the funniest part of the film, which is packed with laughs throughout."
"MichaelOates","Null","23","28","20 May 2004"," an animated delight
","This animated feature about ants, grasshoppers, and various other bugs is an inspirational testament of never giving up despite the odds stacked against you.<br/><br/> The story begins as Flick, voiced by Dave Foley, the ant who always invents things one right after the other. After the grasshoppers come to invade the food supply, Flick comes up with the idea of getting warrior bugs to fight the grasshoppers. Not only will this idea give Flick respect it will allow him to get redemption as he has messed his prior invention up. This epic journey starts as Flick goes in search of the warrior bugs; he finds them in Circus bugs. Consumed for Princess Atta, voiced by Julia Louis Dreyfuss, and her approval, Flick hides the fact that these ""warriors"" are in fact circus bugs. <br/><br/>I was smiling throughout this film because it was the one of the best animated features I've seen. Furthermore ""A Bug's Life"" far eclipses ""ANTZ"" because this film has a point, storyline, and direction.<br/><br/>The ending is no surprise as far as the typical ending goes, but this is definitely a delight worth seeing on the big screen. I recommend this movie because it allows the mind to sit down and relax and without tension watch the movie in peace."
"jaredmobarak","7","9","10","25 November 2007"," Flaming Death!A Bug's Life
","When watching A Bug's Life for the first time in a long while, I couldn't help but see the comparisons with last year's Happy Feet. As far as the main storyline goes, they are very similar, an outcast doing what he can to fit in while also attempting to be special. It just goes to show you how much better that film could have been without its liberal diatribe conclusion. A lot of people disagree with me when I say that I really like Pixar's sophomore effort. Sure it doesn't manage to capture the splendor of Toy Story, nor is the animation out of this world. However, the story is top-notch and the characters are wonderful to spend time with. With plenty of laughs and a moral center to boot, I could watch this one just as much as the studio's other classics.<br/><br/>There is a lot about finding strength from within to conquer all odds here. Between our lead Flick needing to keep his self-esteem up to save his colony, the colony needing to open their eyes onto a new way of living for the future, and the circus bugs finding that they are more than just untalented sideshow freaks, everyone evolves into a better bug by the end of the story. Even the villain Hopper is fully fleshed and menacing for the right reasons. He is not doing it to be mean, but instead understands the fact that the ants outnumber him 100 to 1. He needs them to fear him in order to not have to worry about them finding out the truth. It is very much a circle of life, but not one that can't evolve with the ages.<br/><br/>When thinking about the animation, it is actually quite good. Compared to Antz, the rival film of the time, this is much more realistic and less cartoony. The water is rendered nicely, as is the foliage. You don't have to look much further than the ants' eyes to see how much detail went into the production. The reflections and moistness, despite the smooth exterior, shows the realism. All the bugs are finely crafted too. The flies in the city and the crazy mix of creatures recruited to save the ants are never skimped on, whether for a small role or a more expanded one. It is also in the city that we see the workmanship on the environments. While Ant Island is nice, it is just the outdoors. Bug City contains plenty of garbage doubling as buildings and clubs. It is a great showing of humor and inventiveness to see what the animators used for everything. From the ice cube trays as circus stands, the animal crackers box as circus wagoncomplete with full nutrition guide on the sideand crazy compilation of boxes to create a Times Square of billboards and facades, everything is done right.<br/><br/>As far as much of the humor, you have to credit the acting talent for wonderful delivery and inspired role choices. No one could do a male ladybug better than Dennis Leary with his acerbic wit. I dare you to think of someone better. Our leads are great too with Dave Foley as Flick and Julia Louis-Dreyfus as Princess Atta, as well as the always-fantastic Kevin Spacey as Hopper. Spacey not only steals many scenes from the movie, but also takes center stage in the bloopers during the credits. Yes, A Bug's Life was the originator of animated outtakes from Pixar, a tradition that has continued on. With many tongue-in-cheek bug jokes laced throughout, you also have to give props to the huge supporting cast. Full of ""those guy actors,"" it is people like Richard Kind, Brad Garrett, and the late Joe Ranft as Heimlich the worm who bring the biggest laughs.<br/><br/>Overall, it may be the simplest story brought to screen by Pixar, one that has been told in one form or the other numerous times over the years, but it is inspired enough and fresh enough to deliver an enjoyable experience. There are joyous moments, sad times, and even action packed scenes of suspense with birds coming in to join the fun. Complete with a couple of my favorite Pixar characters, Tuck and Roll, there isn't too much bad that I can think of saying about it."

","Critically, people say that Antz is better. Antz is a good film, but I enjoyed Bug's Life a bit more. I can't remember a Pixar animation, other than the two Toy Story films, that I was laughing so hard. The animation is clean, the story is original and doesn't preach. The voice overs are what make this movie. Dave Foley is an earnest ant that gets himself into trouble a lot. Hopper is a superb characterisation by the always wonderful Kevin Spacey, as is Haydn Panettiere as Dot . There is also sterling support from Dennis Leary, David Hyde Pierce and Madeline Kahn, and I could go on and on. The script is fantastic, so funny and sometimes even touching. It lacks the social messages of Antz, but what we have is rock-solid entertainment. 9/10. Bethany Cox"

","After dazzling everyone with its unforgettable debut that revolutionised the entire animation industry in the long run, Pixar Animation Studios' follow up to their highly revered Toy Story is another wonderful piece of imagination, innovation & animation that once again presents a unique take on life but this time from a bug's point of view.<br/><br/>The story of A Bug's Life follows a misfit ant who thinks differently yet only ends up causing more trouble for his colony so when his latest escapade wastes away all the food ants had gathered to offer to the greedy grasshoppers, he decides to make up for it by finding & recruiting tough warrior bugs to save the entire colony from its oppressors.<br/><br/>Directed by John Lasseter, A Bug's Life marks Pixar's second consecutive home-run & just like their previous feature, brims with so much creativity & passion that the narrative it puts on the silver screen remains finely balanced in storytelling department and is then taken to the next level by further refinement & advancement in their state-of-the-art animation.<br/><br/>There are wide range of bugs to be found in this fable and the animators have done a fab job in envisioning, designing & rendering all of them. While none of its characters manage to be memorable, it's the sum of the parts that makes it click. The themes it deals with are nicely addressed, humour is effectively used, score is lightweight but fitting & it never loses its sense of fun.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, A Bug's Life is definitely one of Pixar's most underrated films that may not have anything as memorable as the studio's best works but it nonetheless scores high marks in all filmmaking aspects to make up for an enjoyable & entertaining ride that viewers of all ages can benefit from plus delivers its message of 'strength in unity' with remarkable simplicity & effectiveness.<br/><br/>In many ways, I find it to be a reflection of Pixar's very own modus operandi for it offers an interesting insight into the way these talented minds come together under one roof for the sole purpose of envisioning, creating & stringently refining stories that are fun & entertaining but also not devoid of heart, soul & emotions, with an added incentive to be able to do that without compromising with the art or quality of its medium."

","This was my favourite movie as a kid, or at least one of them. You can't go wrong with this film. It's different and clever, pure Pixar genius. Yeah the animation might be a bit dated but it's still brilliant. It's like old movies, the quality of the camera/film might not be so good but the film itself is brilliant. No child can't grow up without watching this at least once. Hopper used to terrify me! All in all, FANTASTIC film that's funny and enjoyable for everyone, no matter their age.

","I really like this movie. It's cute, adorable, sweet and fun-loving with lots of comedy aimed at young viewers. Don't get me wrong, this movie can be enjoyed by adults, such as me. I was a child when I first saw this movie and now as an adult, I still really enjoy it.<br/><br/>In this movie, we step into the world of bug's and see how they live. It's so cool. Every year, a bunch of mean grasshoppers comes to the anthill, our main characters, and eat what food they have collected. How rude is that? Anyway, one day, when preparing the food, Flik, accidentally drops some of the food and now the ants don't have enough for themselves and the grasshoppers. The grasshoppers give the ants one more chance to get the food, so Flik sets off to find bugs that are willing to help them stop the grasshoppers reign of terror, once and for all.<br/><br/>Fun Fact: Robert De Niro turned down the role of Hopper.<br/><br/>Overall, I give this episode a 7 out of 10."
"Tweekums","8","4","4","15 October 2012"," A fun insect adventure from Pixar
","Every summer the ants must harvest grain for the coming winter; not just for themselves but for the bullying grasshoppers who demand half the harvest. One of the ants, an inventor named Flik, tries to find ways to make the harvest easier but the other ants aren't impressed; they prefer the old ways. When the grasshoppers come all the ants flee onto their anthill but as Flik adds his contribution to the pile he knocks it over and it is all lost. Hopper, the leader of the grasshoppers tells the ants that they must provide twice the normal amount of grain before the end of summer or they will take all the ants food and let them starve. Flik offers to go into town to get some warrior insects to fight off the grasshoppers when they return; his offer is accepted... not because he is expected to succeed but because it will get him out of the way. The only ant that has any faith in Flik is Princess Dot, but she is just a child. In town Flik meets a group of unsuccessful circus insects and mistakes them for warriors. He returns home a hero, but when is becomes apparent that they aren't warriors the colony appears to be doomed.<br/><br/>This isn't one of Pixar's best films but it is still a lot of fun; the story is simple enough for young children to enjoy without being so simple that older viewers will get bored. Most of the character designs are great; I particularly liked the grasshoppers and the various circus insects. The only character design that I though was poor was the bird which is strange as it was probably the creature that looked closest to its real counterpart; perhaps that was the problem... it had no 'character' it was just a dangerous creature whereas everything else was anthropomorphised. The voice cast, which includes Kevin Spacey and a young Hayden Panettiere, do a fine job; I never though they sounded too 'cartoony'. Being rated 'U' there is little to offend here although some parents might find one or two of the gags involving the male ladybird a bit crude and there are some mildly scary moments that could possibly upset younger children."
"andy-188","7","4","4","6 December 1998"," brilliantly imaginative
","I thought this film was really brilliant and imaginative. Most films these days seem to lack imagination and so it is really something special when a movie possesses this quality. I did think the story was a little lame, but this was more than compensated for by the creativity of the artists who made it.   I thought it was a million times better than Antz which seems pedestrian and lacking in imagination in comparison."

","The strongest point of every Pixar movie I've seen is that they all have heart. While the excellent colourful animation has been consistent in quality, it's the soulful stories and memorable characters that we love and return to with each viewing. 'A Bug's Life' has always been on my to-watch list and I finally bought the DVD yesterday. It's already become a favourite after first viewing. The animation is beautifully detailed and the motion is brilliant. Not only are the characters wonderfully illustrated but also the background is given plenty of detail. Moreover these characters are so adorable as they are superbly brought to life that you'll fall in love with them. The voice cast that includes talents like Bonnie Hunt, Kevin Spacey, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Dave Foley and Richard Kind do a great job. Clearly, Pixar does not depend on stars (unlike Dreamworks) and they rather focus on the material by creating it with heart. 'A Bug's Life' is another winner from Pixar that I'll very likely be revisiting again and again."

","Is this perhaps the most underrated Pixar film to date? It could be, let's see: it's super entertaining, it has funny moments, creative bits of action and also small tender parts. The characters were built to know their place in this film, which in my personal view I would describe its plot as an ""adaptation"" (quote unquote because unofficially it is not) of Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai (1954), for they both consist of a small village or colony being subjugated by invaders demanding food during each invasion, but placed in a world of an animated colony of ants; so the protagonist, Flik, comes up with a great idea, to search for a group of ""warrior"" bugs (they are in fact members of a circus) to help them defeat the invaders, a group of malicious grasshoppers whose leader may be one of the best villains Pixar's creative team has ever offered, the evil Hopper. This movie also subtly touches the idea of revolution, as the ants ultimately wish to eradicate their raiders in order to live life peacefully. Another thing worth mentioning is the clever way in which they decide to deal with the grasshoppers, and although it is met with an unfortunate mishap, the denouement of the film is utterly satisfying, just wait and see if you haven't already! 
Oh, and the outtakes at the end of the movie are really ingenious and creative, not to mention funny! A great adventure that I would watch many many times, but I feel that with so many excellent films that Pixar has provided the public over the years this one may not rank as high as many others, which is why I believe that is somewhat underrated."

One of the innovative attachments being the delightful ""out-takes"" added to the end of the film. The DVD has two sets of these out-takes where as I?m told the VHS cassette has one alternating version per tape. The DVD also features ""Gerry?s Game"" which is a delightful little PIXAR short that was also shown prior to the film in theaters.<br/><br/>This is by far the superior insect-film in comparison to Dreamworks? ""Antz"", which in all fairness is pretty good, but lacks something in the animation and in the story development and characters. If you look at the star voices of both films, ""Antz"" is largely cast with big name ""movie"" stars with a few familiar ""TV"" star voices, where ""A Bug?s Life"" is just the opposite, loaded with ""TV"" stars with Kevin Spacey as the only stand out exception. But the difference in quality is distinct and obvious.<br/><br/>Dreamworks can?t be blamed or surprised though, when you go head to head with Disney, you have your work cut out for you. This is the kind of film that almost makes me wish I had children to share it with. Don?t think for a second that this is just a movie for kids, though."

","A Bug's Life is a very good animated feature. This movie is for younger children, but it is also a great movie for people my age. The story is about an ant named Flik. He brought havoc onto his colony when he destroyed the food that were for the superior grasshoppers. He gets banished and he must find bigger bugs to fix the mess. This movie is a classic because it is a good movie and it is a Pixar movie. The animation is brilliant especially for the late 90's. The story is good, but a little more detail would be suffice. The voice acting is good as with most animation movies. The music is nice to listen to. Nothing special, but it earned an nomination for one of the music categories.

"aidanratesmovies","9","2","2","8 April 2020"," Not perfect, but quite enjoyable
","Although consistently entertaining, A Bug's Life fails to deliver on all accounts, by feeling more formulaic overall than its own interesting concepts sprinkled throughout. The film can be very humorous at times, but can also vary on the border of being overly-goofy and in result, some jokes do fall quite flat. The animation, although not as great as its work shortly before, is quite good and full of vibrant color, which makes it very easy on the eyes. The music in the film is really good, with Randy Newman providing a stellar soundtrack, as he always does. The voice work is fairly impressive, with the circus bugs taking the lead in terms of voice work and in character development. The circus bugs are often the best part of the film, and their humor seems rather genuine and their story very engaging, unlike some tropes used earlier with the ants themselves. However, the ant Dot in the film can prove to be quite an adorable change of pace throughout, and stole the show in every scene she was in. In the end, A Bug's Life is far from Pixar's greatest work, but is a mildly enjoyable time. It has a wonderful cast of supporting characters, and is full of vibrant colors, and a score that is very easy to listen to.

"mitsubishizero","9","2","2","16 July 2019"," One of Pixar's best movies
","This was a childhood movie of mine and needless to say it's aged well. The story's about a misfit named Flik (Dave Foley) who invents gadgets in hopes of improving his colony's work conditions but unsurprisingly they backfire and attract the ire of the other ants. It doesn't help that the ants are basically enslaved to the grasshoppers led by the cruel, manipulative and sadistic Hopper (Kevin Spacey) who threatens them after Flik accidentally destroys their food supply when one of his inventions backfire. After the grasshoppers leave Flik is tried afterwards where he convinces them to let him leave to get help for when the grasshoppers return. He treks to the big city where he comes across the Circus Bugs whom through a misunderstanding on both sides go back to his colony.<br/><br/>After several hijinks ensure such as avoiding a giant bird and witnessing a graphic play put on by the kids the Bugs slowly integrate into the colony and Flik begins to get to know Princess Atta (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) who's nervous about being the new queen. The movie's enjoyable to watch. The animation's a little dated but it's still good. The characters are well developed and enjoyable to watch. Sure they can be a little cliched but to be fair they do something new with them. The story's based off The Ant and the Grasshopper with a huge, creative twist. It's almost hard not to talk about this movie without mentioning Antz. I like both movies but I think the former's better. It has better animation, characters and jokes. A Bug's life is a great movie both kids and adults can enjoy. I highly recommend you check this movie out."

","Several of Walt Disney Pictures' best animated films of recent years have been released or distributed through Pixar, an animation studio that specializes in computer generated animation and ""A Bug's Life"", their follow up to the hugely successful ""Toy Story"" ranks as one of the best and funniest Walt Disney Pictures animated films. Released during the same month as a similar computer generated animated film, ""Antz"", ""A Bug's Life"" suffers no bad comparisons because I consider it to be just as good as amusing as ""Antz."" The main focus of the film is Flik, a worker ant who has a very inventive mind and keen eye for detail. He means well but his attempts at helping his fellow ant colony with his ideas and inventions usually cause accidental disaster. One day, the ant colony set up a tribute display for a bad grasshopper named Hopper and his gang but Flik accidentally knocks it down. Hopper is very upset by this and he threatens to kill off the entire colony if they don't build him another provisions pile by the time he inspects the area again. Flik decides to help. He has only a few days to find some ""warrior"" bugs that can stand up to Hopper and his gang. He comes across a group of disgruntled bugs that had just been fired from their gigs at a flea circus. Flik decides to bring them back to the colony and recruit them as warrior bugs. An inventive idea for a children's film with much of the same humor and ideas that helped to make ""Toy Story"" an animated classic."

","A Bug's Life was Pixar's second film, and while it was a commercial and critical success, it's one of their lesser-known films. A pity - because it's pretty darn good! It's about a colony of ants, who send one of their hated members (an inventor who ALWAYS messed up WITHOUT FAIL) on a dope mission to find warrior bugs to protect them from the grasshoppers who were their de facto overlords. He finds what he thinks are warrior bugs - but which are actually circus bugs - and brings them back to the nest.<br/><br/>The animation probably doesn't look much compared to, say, Inside Out, but it's still pretty good. The story's excellent - an oppressed people rising up against their oppressors. But, it's also a character story, with great character development all round.<br/><br/>It's good."
"classicsoncall","8","2","2","19 May 2018"," ""Shoo fly, don't bother me.""
","It all started with one of Aesop's famous fables, and then in 1934, Disney produced a classic Silly Symphony titled ""The Grasshopper and the Ants"". It tells the story of a single lazy grasshopper who fiddles his summer away living for the moment while his neighbor ants work tirelessly, squirreling away massive amounts of food for the winter months. When the cold finally arrives, the starving grasshopper is reminded of his laziness and lack of preparation by the ant queen, who allows him to stay with the colony if he plays his fiddle, in a sense, working for the food and warmth he'll be provided.<br/><br/>Disney ups the ante in ""A Bug's Life"" by pitting a grasshopper warlord and his followers against a huge colony of ants by demanding that they provide food for them on a regular basis. Noting that the ants far outnumber the grasshoppers in quantity, little Flik (voiced by Dave Foley) embarks on a series of initiatives to free the ants from domination by Hopper (Kevin Spacey) and his mean crew. I've read other viewer comparisons of the movie to Seven Samurai/The Magnificent Seven, and that might work except in one respect. When push came to shove, it was Flik and his own ingenuity that helped win the day for Princess Atta (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) and the colony. With more than a little help from the voiceless, colorful bird that made bird food out of Hopper. <br/><br/>I always get a kick out of the ingenuity and cleverness that goes into these animated features and this one provided it in spades. Very colorful and well drawn, the insect characters are unique and fun, especially the 'warrior' bunch from the circus. If you liked this, you owe it to yourself to look up the original Disney Silly Symphony, as the restored version is glorious with outstanding color and first rate animation. You can't go wrong with either one."
"CMTiago","8","2","2","11 September 2015"," Pixar's hidden gem
","When looking back at the Pixar movies, one almost seems to forget A Bug's Life. Perhaps it's the fact that another similar movie from DreamWorks called Antz came out that same year and the two are often mistaken for one another. Or maybe it's the fact that Pixar has made even bigger and slightly better movies since. Either way, this was the last movie from Pixar's first few I had left to watch, and once again great animated fun was delivered.<br/><br/>I'm happy to say that the Pixar mark was very much hit with this movie and my expectations were met. So this movie tells the story of an ant called Flik, who has to recruit ""warrior"" insects to fight off the Grasshoppers that demand double the amount of food the ants can supply. The movie really starts to get funny when the circus bugs that Flik gets as warriors (or so he thinks) come into play. Their interactions, as well as their quirks make for some very good comedic scenes. As for the main plot, the empowerment of the little ants over the mighty grasshoppers is endearing enough to pull you in. Overall, this movie is a sort of a hidden gem of Pixar, as it is overshadowed by movies that even I admit to liking more. Nonetheless, A Bug's Life is on par with those entertainment wise.<br/><br/>Rating: 8/10"

It's also really funny mostly because the character's were funny and likable like the fat caterpillar, Heimlich. It also has some nice voice acting from Kevin Spacey as the villain, Hopper.<br/><br/>A Bug's Life is a great movie for the whole family to watch and it talk's about the life of a bug. Get it?"

When, the bird comes to eat the bugs, that scene was superb and good. Even, the last scene was awesome and cool. Even, Flik's inventions was good.

","When I bought my Toy Story tape when it came out to Video after being released in theaters I saw a trailer for this that said from the creators of Toy Story. As soon as I saw that I knew this was gonna be a good feature! I was right! A Bug's Life like Toy Story is great story, great characters and great animation. My favorite characters are Dim the rhino Beetle voiced by Brad Garrett and Hemlich the Caterpillar voiced by the late Pixar Storyman Joe Ranft. My favorite scene is when Slim the walking stick (David Hyde Pierce) lifts up Hemlich trying to distract the Bird and Hemlich's like You hoo Mr. Early Bird. How about a nice tasting worm on a stick and Slim's like I'm going to snap! I'm going to snap! I just died laughing at that scene. Being a big fan of insects I think A Bug's Life is my favorite Pixar even though I know a lot of people consider it the worst Pixar film ever! I don't know how you could hate a Pixar film! I think they're all pretty good films! Good job PIXAR!"
"Anonymous_Maxine","9","2","2","28 April 2008"," Another wonderful family adventure from Pixar!
","Lately I have been watching a lot of Tom Hanks films and old Chaplin films and even some of Rowan Atkinson's early Bean performances, and it seems that all of them have their own unique charm that permeates throughout their work, something that allows them to identify with audience members of all ages, in a way that just makes you feel good. A Bug's Life has that same charm, it has a connection with real life that allows us to easily suspend disbelief and accept a lot of talking insects, because even though they talk, they still ACT just like real bugs. It's like the team that made the movie found a way to bring us into the mind of a child and allow us to think like them, to imagine bugs the way a young mind does.<br/><br/>Honey, I Shrunk The Kids was one of my favorite films when I was younger, and to me, A Bug's Life is like a more realistic version of that movie, if only because the animation is so breathtaking and this style of story-telling just opens up so many more narrative possibilities. I try not to compare it to something like Toy Story (which I still maintain is the best computer animated film ever made), because the story of A Bug's Life is not quite as good as Toy Story's, but then again, almost nothing is. The important thing is that it is still wonderful fun. <br/><br/>The story concerns a colony of hard working bugs who have an impressively developed society, mostly geared around building a harvest of food, most of which will go to the tyrannical grasshoppers, vastly superior in strength and general meanness, and hopefully still leave enough left over for the bugs to make it through the winter. We are treated to some visits from the grasshoppers, who make it clear that if the bugs provide an unsatisfactory quantity of food, the consequences will be dire. And incidentally, the similarities between this crippling level of food extraction is strikingly similar to Mao Tse-tung's vicious forcing of food from his own people during the ""Great Leap ForwardÂ…""<br/><br/>The fun and excitement begins when Flik, the main character, sets off on a quest to find a gang of appropriate warrior bugs to come back and help defend the colony against the grasshoppers. You see, he spilled all of the amassed food and placed everyone in great danger, so he feels it's his responsibility, but he inadvertently ends up hiring a struggling group of insect circus performers. Great for the audience, not so great for the safety of the clan. <br/><br/>The movie was released back in the late 90s, when so many films seemed to have been coming out in twos, like Armageddon and Deep Impact, Independence Day and The Arrival, A Bug's Life and Antz, etc. Comparisons between A Bug's Life and Antz are inevitable, although it seems clear to me that A Bug's Life is by far the superior film, and not only because it doesn't star Woody Allen stuttering and whining through the lead role. This is great family fun!"

","1998 was the battle of the bugs between Dreamworks' ""Antz"" to Disney's ""A Bug's Life"". While Antz was an animated movie of a Woody Allen (the voice of Z in Antz) film making references to psychology, Judiasm, sexes and other trademarks, A Bug's Life was just plain good old' entertainment where there were jokes for both the kids and adults to understand and not have to worry about a moral or being bored.<br/><br/>If Antz dealt with the underground of ants and their life styles, then A Bug's Life has all the insects we keep as either pets or a collection of squished items on the floor.<br/><br/>This film is about a little ant name Flik (voice by Dave Foley of Kids in the Hall) an inventor/screw-up where he messes up during the most important event of the season. The season of summer for ants is probably one of the most dreaded season since all the ants have to gather food for the menacing grasshoppers where the vicious leader of the gang, Hopper (voice by Kevin Spacey), thinks of the ants as inferior slaves where at any time they could have their head squish. Flik does something to lose all the food where everybody depends on him to be the hero to find somebody to step up to the grasshoppers. So the little ant goes into town to find any insects where in a sort of ""Three Amigos"" scenario he finds a group of bugs and ask to help him and the ant colony where he doesn't know that they're a bunch of circus flunkies.<br/><br/>""A Bug's Life"" is a barrel of laughs where not only will people find this better than ""Antz"" but find something within all the characters.<br/><br/>As for the cast line up prior to Dave Foley and Kevin Spacey, there's also Julia-Louis Dreyfus, Brad Garrett, Richard Kind, David Hyde Pierce, Bonnie Hunt, Phylis Diller, Denis Leary and more to make you want to come back for more."

The bloopers were a riot!<br/><br/>But again Hollywood pumps out a high-gloss, low-impact movie.  For all its beauty, it was a pretty ho-hum story.  They could have really played up the Seven Samurai angle by offering a more in-depth, poignant view of the life of these oppressed ants.  Perhaps tugged on the heart-strings a little more. I found myself almost rooting for the grasshoppers against these simple, whining ants.  A little more character development could have made this the greatest animated feature of all time."

"Animany94","7","3","5","24 November 2017"," One of the weaker Pixar movies, but still enjoyable.
","Pixar really started at the top with the spectacular mega hit Toy Story which still holds up as a great story with great characters. That isn't exactly the same with their second feature A Bug's Life. <br/><br/>The story is not that unique to begin with. Heck, Pixar had a ton to live up to after the surprise of Toy Story, so it is forgivable. Flik is our neurotic main character who longs after being special, but is rejected by his colony which must provide food to feed the tyrannical grasshoppers, lead by Hopper, to avoid them attacking the colony. <br/><br/>Given the fact that Dreamworks' Antz came out shortly before A Bug's Life they are quite similar. I guess you know the controversy surrounding those two movies. <br/><br/>I think they both a good in their own ways, and what makes A Bug's Life good is the colours and the circus bugs as the comedic addition to the plot. They are the highlight of the entire movie and can make both kids and adults laugh. <br/><br/>In my opinion Hopper as a villain is also doing a great job. When his colony of grasshoppers arrived at the ants' near the climax used to scare me as a kid. Their tall and menacing figures slowly emerging from the fog is bone-chilling. <br/><br/>All in all, A Bug's Life is a good children's movie and adults may also find one or two things enjoyable, too. Mainly the circus bugs, though."

","A battle is being waged on the frontier of technology.  Oh yes, the computer generated film swing is in full effect, bringing the joys and ecstacy of worlds fantastic.  But why oh why must script and story suffer at the hands of silicon?<br/><br/>""A Bug's Life"" is a simple tale of Flik, an ant with a passion for invention.  Obviously this makes him a hit with his fellow colonists, who fear new ways, and therefore dismiss the ideas as sheer madness.  And following a diastrous incident involving the fearsome grasshoppers, Flik is sent to find help in defending the ants against the grasshoppers when they return for their offering.  And instead of warriors, he finds and recruits a group of recently fired circus acts, including a caterpillar who can't wait to be a butterfly, a labybird who is often mistaken for a girl, and a pair of woodlouse who speak not a word of English.  And so, Flik returns with the troop to fight the enemy.  Of course, nothing runs smoothly, and with the Princess Atta on the watch, it's gonna be tough.<br/><br/>""A Bug's Life"" is by no means a bad film: there's plenty to keep the kids entertained, and it's fun to watch as the story unfolds.  But where's the humour we came to expect from the likes of ""Toy Story"" or the similarly themed ""Antz""?  The script is predictable and bland with no twists.  And the characters remain two dimensional in their 3D universe.  Fun for kids, but little of interest for those who relished the multi-layed humour of ""Toy Story""."

Don't get me wrong, it's not that bad a film but it does seem like when Disney made this, they realised soon after that they were going to have to step up in their next efforts. <br/><br/>The animation in the film is shoddy in parts, a vast difference from its predecessor, Toy Story which is almost note perfect. There are some quite clear mistakes which suggests to me that the makers were in a hurry to churn it out as a money making project. <br/><br/>It has to be said that the cast of characters out with the ant community are superb, very funny and very clever, but they don't appear in the film until a good while in. Up until this point, the characters are dull, bland and they all look the same. There's no creativity. Yes they are all ants but some defining features would have been nice. <br/><br/>That being said, it is still a good film to sit and watch with the family, it's harmless, there's little to no real violence and it's not easy for films to pass that off.

","A Bug's Life is a fun family film with an interesting origin. Being Pixar's second film, there was a great amount of pressure on it. Obviously I think we can all agree that Toy Story easily surpasses this film, but for what it is, it is a strong sophomore film that was necessary to kick off Pixar's 2000s golden age.
This film is based off the famous ""Seven Samauri"" japanese film, and takes the concept of a village under attack into an interesting point of view. We get to see why the grasshoppers act the way they act, while still siding with the heros.
Of course when compared to other Pixar films, this one can feel quite mediocre, yet not every Pixar film needs to be a home run."

"ElMaruecan82","7","1","1","14 August 2016"," What's bugging bugs...
","You know the fable from Aesopus (or La Fontaine) with ""The Ant and the Grasshopper"", the ant works the whole summer gathering food for winter while the grasshopper idly sings and enjoys the sun and when winter comes, he realizes, a bit too late, that Karma is a bitch, and so is the ant. Loosely (very loosely) translated into Disney language, the grasshopper becomes the villain who forces the ant to offer him food for winter in exchange of ""protection"" from termites or bigger ants. But the story must sustain the movie format, let's make it a colony of ants versus a gang of greedy grasshoppers, and then work on a script à la ""Three Amigos"" and you get ""A Bug's Life"", Pixar's second film.<br/><br/>So, if ""Toy Story"" was to 3D what ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" was to traditional animation, well I guess that makes ""A Bug's Life"" a little bit like ""Pinocchio"", at least as far as chronology and technological improvement go, this comparison is valid, but while ""A Bug's Life"" didn't hold up as well as ""Toy Story"" 18 years, for the film's defense, it has nothing to do with quality. Indeed, this is a marvel of animation and entertainment and the technological accomplishment it represents says a lot about the progresses made in three years.<br/><br/>Drawing toys is one thing and I said about ""Toy Story"" that it had the merit to put the setting in a very cozy and familiar environment instead of the usual forests and castles. In ""A Bug's Life"", we go back to the forests, but on a smaller, smaller scale and the level of detail is so phenomenal, each frame must have required a lot of hours of works and remember there are 24 frames per second, and many frames contains dozens of character, because, hey, they're insects, small creatures.<br/><br/>""A Bug's Life"" is the result of thousands and thousands of hard working and the animators deserve all the credit for not having surrendered to the 'easy way', during the mass scenes, I closely looked at the ants in the background, you never have the feeling of a block or repetitive shots, and from what the trivia said, they used a computer program that would animate several group of ants randomly placed in each part of the screen, and it contributes to convey a realistic mass effect. And that's how we imagine ants.<br/><br/>Of course, the film is not just about ants but is a tribute to that underworld (literally) that inspires a constant fascination and revulsion. I hate insects but for some reason, I'm fascinated by documentaries about them as if the best way to finally look at the forms, the shapes, the colors, the interactions with other insects or the outside world or fights is to make sure they're not here. Not that ""A Bug's Life"" has a documentary-like value like the great ""Microcosmos"" but even on a documentary, I would have had a hard time enjoying the sight of cockroaches or grasshoppers. In ""A Bug's Life"", insects are cool to watch, and from their standpoints, rain doesn't play a salvation role anymore and cute birds are like scary monsters, time have changed since ""Bambi"".<br/><br/>But if ""A Bug's Life"" had everything to please the eyes, and to entertain, so why don't we celebrate it like ""Toy Story""'? I guess it was released too soon without having the privilege of a sequel younger audiences could appreciate, it's hard to carry a reputation when you're made just between ""Toy Story"" and ""Shrek"". And it's all justice that ""Antz"" suffers from the same fate, the two films, from rival studios were released the same year, and it's obvious there was some leak, but let's accept as a happy ending that they didn't go to court (although it did terminate some friendships) and that both did well at the box-office but I think I would paraphrase the Emperor Joseph's quote by saying ""there were too many characters"" and I'm not saying that was the problem within the story, but about its appeal.<br/><br/>Take the ants, they are a colony where each one has a role to play, some carry the food, some guide them etc. they can't think of individuals, except for the queen, her heiress, princess Atta (Julia-Louis Dreyfus) and her sister Dot (young Hayden Pannetiere) but apart from this podium, all ants are just ants, the one who emerges from the mass is Flik, the outcast inventor who always fail (one of his last inventions will cause the destruction of the offering for the grasshoppers, forcing them to prepare food again hence depriving themselves from winter food). Flik is an individual yet the story can't allow us to root for one individual, they're insects and they all work as group, even the mercenaries he's supposed to hire, in reality circus workers covering different personalities, there is not one to stand above.<br/><br/>The film is a triumph in characterization and high-scale animation, but take all the movies that succeeded after ""Shrek"", ""Finding Nemo"", ""Monsters & Co"", there was a core of significant characters, Shrek and Fiona, Woody and Buzz, the more you identify with one, the more positively you respond to the spectacle. In ""A Bug's Life"", we do empathize with the ants as a whole, but it's hard to feel any stronger toward them. You admire the artistic design, the set of colors, the little jokes here and there, but the only real lesson is that there is strength in unity, but this is a message you can respond to in a war or a sport movie and even then you have the main protagonist.<br/><br/>Animation is a world of magic and dream, to be enjoyed in a more individual way, where you can hook your heart on one person. ""A Bug's Life"" should have been called ""Bugs' Lives"", it's great animation but not necessarily a great film."

","A Bug's Life was Pixar's second dip into the movie business and is widely considered to be on the lower end of Pixar's quality films. When I was growing up or was one of my favorites, and to this day I don't get where the hate comes from. This movie follows an inventor ant named Flik (Dave Foley) who is your stereotype clumsy dreamer. His colony is extorted through fear of the grasshoppers, led by Hopper (Kevin Spacey), for their food. The grasshoppers make the ants collect food for them to have during the ""Rainy Season."" After Flik accidentally destroys a large supply of food, causing Hopper to double the quota, Flik goes on a quest to find some big bugs in the big city to protect the colony and stop the tyrannical grasshopper rule once and for all. Unfortunately, he gets a group of bad circus performers instead, and may find a way to use their limited talents to save them all. This movie is underrated. The political undertones to this film speak volumes, especially in our current political climate. The voice acting is decent. Kevin Spacey definitely gives a menacing performance, and it's adorable to hear a young Hayden Panettiere as an ant princess. The animation is pretty nice for its time. Certain moments looked better than others, but the real triumph was texturing, especially in the grasshoppers' designs. This movie isn't perfect. Many moments were predictable, and the movie relied heavily on gags. But still, it's fun and funny. And it does craft moments of actual fear and shows kids the power people can have when they stand together. It's definitely aimed more towards kids (even if it does get a bit...*murdery* seriously, rewatch it, it's very dark), but adults can appreciate that there's something there for them too. Altogether I'd rate this movie a 7. Not a bad Pixar film. Should be seen. <br/><br/>PS: Ratzenberger's role in this film was P.T.Flea, the ringleader of the circus bugs. It's a funny role that sits his voice well."

","This is perhaps one of the weaker of Pixar's efforts but even a weak effort by Pixar is better than ninety percent of the stories out there. A Bug's Life is a great example of what to do right in creating a story. They surround the main character, Flik, (voice provided by Dave Foley) with colorful characters much like in classic comedies. What a shame that Joe Ranft, the voice of Heimlich died. Such a lovable character. Then Pixar makes sure there's a good story to go with it. This story is about a colony of ants who are tormented by some bully grasshoppers who take what the ants work so hard for. Even though the story is animated, Pixar makes the world a metaphor for the real world. Another fine effort for the Pixar gang."

","There was such a magic on the screen in 1995 when the people at Pixar came up with the first fully computer-animated film, Toy Story. Their second feature film, A Bug's Life, may miss the bull's-eye but Pixar's target is so lofty, it's hard to find the film anything less than irresistible. Brighter and more colorful than the other animated insect movie of 1998 (Antz), A Bug's Life is the sweetly told story of Flik (voiced by David Foley), an ant searching for better ways to be a bug. His colony unfortunately revolves around feeding and fearing the local grasshoppers (lead by Hopper, voiced with gleeful menace by Kevin Spacey). When Flik accidentally destroys the seasonal food supply for the grasshoppers he decides to look for help (""We need bigger bugs!""). The ants, led by Princess Atta (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), are eager to dispose of the troublesome Flik. Yet he finds help--a hearty bunch of bug warriors--and brings them back to the colony. Unfortunately they are just traveling performers afraid of conflict. <br/><br/>As with Toy Story, the ensemble of creatures and voices is remarkable and often inspired. Highlights include wiseacre comedian Denis Leary as an UN-ladylike ladybug, Joe Ranft as the German-accented caterpillar, David Hyde Pierce as a stick bug, and Michael McShane as a pair of unintelligible pill bugs. The scene-stealer is Atta's squeaky-voiced sister, baby Dot (Hayden Panettiere), who has a big sweet spot for Flik.<br/><br/>More gentle and kid-friendly than Antz, A Bug Life's still has some good suspense and a wonderful demise of the villain. However, the film--a giant worldwide hit--will be remembered for its most creative touch: ""outtakes"" over the end credits à la many live-action comedy films. These dozen or so scenes (both ""editions"" of outtakes are contained here) are brilliant and deserve a special place in film history right along with 1998's other most talked-about sequence: the opening Normandy invasion in Saving Private Ryan.<br/><br/>The video also contains Pixar's delightful Oscar-winning short, Geri's Game. Box art varies."

","Nice movie. Great animation. Well up to Disney quality. It reminded me of Toy Story - superb effects but lacking a little in the storyline department. This movie suffered badly in relation to Antz which is a better movie with a stronger storyline. The movies are very similar but Woody Allen and Sharon Stone are much better than their counterparts in Bug's Life. Of course, this doesn't matter if you're 10 years old - my kids loved Bug's Life.

A Bug's Life is another excellent addition to this unique canon. It is made by Pixar, the company that made the even better Toy Story a couple of years ago. This film rides that finicky edge between appealing to kids and adults alike, a task notoriously difficult to accomplish. A Bug's Life showcases brilliant computer animation with a time-tested Seven Samurai story - young man must leave home to redeem himself, brings back friends, becomes a hero and changes the community for the better.

"southdavid","5","0","0","29 June 2020"," Ant-iseptic
","I've always viewed ""A Bugs Life"" as the Pixar film that got away, the one that nobody loves like ""Toy Story"", ""Finding Nemo"" or even ""Cars"", but a slight rejig of the alphabetical order on Disney Plus pushed it up to being the next film on my list to watch. I remain underwhelmed.<br/><br/>Flick (Dave Foley) is an ant, whose colony pays protection food to a group of violent grasshoppers at the start of the summer. When he accidentally destroys the offering, he leaves the village to look for a group of tough bugs to come and protect the colony from the grasshoppers and their monstrous leader Hopper (Kevin Spacey). Triumphantly returning with who he believes are just the creatures for the job, he's distraught when they reveal to him that they are, in fact, a circus troupe.<br/><br/>So I really didn't enjoy ""A Bugs Life"". I don't want to take away anything from the monumental effort that goes into making any form of animated film, but the film does look pretty dated now. The tree and plant effects are pretty convincing still but the characters, particularly facially have a dull plastic-ness to them. There's a ""dead behind the eyes"" look to them that fortunately Pixar managed to overcome pretty quickly going forward from here.<br/><br/>That's not the only problem though. The storyline is pedestrian and familiar given it's a reworking of ""Seven Samurai"" or perhaps more closely ""Three Amigos"", and the script lacking in genuine moments of humour. There's a dissonance between the world that the Ants inhabit - essentially, just an empty hole in the ground, and the trash reconfigured to reflect the human world that the rest of the insects have, with bars, restaurants and circuses.<br/><br/>I don't want to go overboard with my criticism, there's no one area so spectacularly awful as to undermine the film, it's just that the experience of the film is consistently underwhelming."
"Igenlode Wordsmith","4","0","0","26 June 2020"," Disney by numbers
","This was a massive disappointment. I saw ""Toy Story"" long after it came out, when the whole computer animation hype was long since old hat, but still loved it at once. I really enjoyed ""The Incredibles"" and thought ""Ratatouille"", ""WALL-E"", ""Up"" and ""Inside Out"" took animated film to a whole new level. But it turns out ""A Bug's Life"" is... a whole heap of steaming clichs.<br/><br/>Almost from the very beginning it felt as if they were sticking in just about every Hollywood/Disney trope aimed at the under-tens, many of them painfully inappropriate to the setting. Sorry, but ants don't have cute little child ants who set up a 'clubhouse' and save the world when the adults are busy giving up; ants have squishy larvae. Grasshoppers don't have mothers or little brothers. Worker ants don't have romantic moments with 'princesses', because worker ants are FEMALE. (And seriously, if you were going to design an ant-powered flying machine, why would you power it with child ants, instead of the strongest team in the colony? On the other hand, if it was originally designed for adult ants, how would the little ones even be able to get the wings to move?)<br/><br/>And then of course we've got the whole 'misunderstood loner whose brilliant ideas always go embarrassingly wrong' scenario, which I also found so clichd and obvious as to be almost painful. And 'the power of family/friendship can overcome everything' and 'you just need to believe in yourself'... it's practically a checkbox list of standard tropes, and while the same messages appear in many, many good films (there's a reason why they're standard), here I rapidly ended up with the feeling that it was Disney product being done by numbers. Watching ""A Bug's Life"" versus ""Toy Story"" is like watching ""Flushed Away"" versus ""Chicken Run""; the magic isn't there and it's gone corporate.<br/><br/>It was also very noticeable that for all the gnashing mouthparts and serrated limbs, the worst anyone gets threatened with in the script is getting 'stomped' or 'squished', which doesn't really match up to the visuals and again is rather obviously by-the-book for small children. The hero's Grand Plan is discarded (for no very clear reason -- why would the discovery of his deception about the circus prevent the planned 'scare-crow' tactic from working?) and then heroically launched again at the last minute and then after a prolonged show fails anyway. In another context that might have come across as stunning originality, but by that point it just struck me as being an excuse for this film to have its cake and eat it; for him to be a Great Inventor, but also demonstrate that true strength comes from love and the power of unity and standing up to your fears, blah blah blah.<br/><br/>As a result the finale is incredibly prolonged -- like much of the rest of the film. The 'botched circus' scene at the beginning in particular felt as if it lasted far too long, partly I think because it was presumably supposed to be funny, and that's not my type of humour at all. (But then, thinking about it, that goes for quite a lot of the would-be-funny parts of this film.)<br/><br/>I'm afraid I found ""A Bug's Life"" actively annoying from quite early on, and I'm not quite sure in all justice why. It felt cynically manipulative and shallow, as if you could see all the cogs turning and buttons being pushed, and being stuffed with bad biology didn't help. (Heinrich the fat caterpillar pupates and turns into... a fat caterpillar with wings?) I felt zero chemistry where the characters were concerned. Yes, it's a U-rated children's film that was never aimed at the likes of me in the first place, but a good children's film ought to work for adults too.<br/><br/>After all, I've seen plenty of pictures that commit the 'sins' mentioned above, and loved them. ""Chicken Run"", for instance, features hens with teeth acting in a highly anthropomorphic way, and it even has an artificial flapping bird... but that production struck me as simply brilliant. And compared to a lot of children's films, ""A Bug's Life"" does more or less show its villain being killed and eaten, whereas a lot of classic Hollywood movies go to lengths to indicate that if the villain dies, that's absolutely not the hero's responsibility in any way.<br/><br/>I think perhaps what irked me about it was that there didn't seem to be any greater depth -- any references that adults could be expected to get over and above the target audience. The humour remains on the level of ""Francis is a male 'lady'bird... haw, haw haw"", the romance is school-gate stuff, and the attempts at emotional manipulation aren't exactly sophisticated. It was like being subjected to a lecturer who persists in talking to a mixed audience as if they were all six-year-olds."

","The protagonist of this film is relatable from the first moment we meet him. Flik is the idealistic underdog that just begs to be identified with. Flik is the black sheep of the ant colony, and when his invention ruins the tribute to the predatory Grasshoppers, he needs to right this wrong. He recruits a troop of circus bigs, thinking them to be mighty warriors, and the whole group rallies the ant colony to defeat the Grasshopper invasion. The characters are vivid, outlandish, and provide a logical (if strange) set of skills that come in handy. I tend to dislike movies or shows where a huge plot point is based around a miscommunication that could be avoided/solved with basic logic, but in this context, it makes some sense. I can understand the pressure and anxiety that would accompany correcting someone who has overestimated your worth. The emotional beats in this movie land with grace. When the colony discovers that the troupe is real performers, rather than warriors, the betrayal is palpable, and the loss seems personal. When, in the end, the caterpillar finally gains his butterfly wings, it is a small delightful moment of wish fulfillment. John Lasseter directed some of the most iconic films of my childhood and had the same magic touch in each. Toy Story, Cars, The Incredibles, and this movie all have the same magical sense of whimsy and crazy events that remain anchored in real, relatable people."

They're kid-friendly, for sure, but they have a lot of elements which adults can appreciate as well.

","I watched this movie in 2020 immediately after watching Pixar's detail animation masterpiece The Good Dinosaur (2015). I was expecting Pixar's 2nd film that is nearly 2 decades older to really stand out as a dated movie, but to my surprise A Bug's Life isn't a victim of the years. Of course it's behind when you really focus on the details, but the visuals are presented so well that it keeps the viewer focused on the most intricate items on the screen, allowing the brain to ignore rendering quality and be swept up by the story.<br/><br/>The story begins fairly childish, especially by comparison to most of Disney and Pixar's other films. If you can put up with the intro, it quickly grows into a charming story with several clever ideas and jokes. And the villains are truly menacing, which had me filled with tension hoping the ants' plans work out. Unfortunately tension and humor were the only emotions this movie could bring out in me, but I have to give them credit for the rare feat of making me feel true apprehension from the kid's movie genre where heroes usually feel boringly invincible."

","A Bugs Life was Pixar's second offering after Toy Story, and who doesn't love a bit of Pixar? Even as an adult A Bugs Life is a film I can watch over and over again, it just has that charming appeal that is attractive to adults too!<br/><br/>The animation is superb, high-end, spectacular and oh so colourful..., no it doesn't look ""real"", but actually it looks ""better"" than real life does, I like how in animation, particularly with Pixar, they create such life like characters and backdrops while maintaining the allure that animation duly brings. <br/><br/>Flick, the ant and protagonist of A Bugs Life is highly relate-able, a struggling inventor who strives to do right, but inevitably ends up doing wrong, such is so, that in the first act of the film, Flick's latest invention, the harvester that can slash production time in half, misfires and causes some serious chaos. This mishap lands Flick in some serious hot water with the ant council and Flick voluntarily banishes himself from ant island, to which the council agrees.<br/><br/>The action heads to the ""city"" (a dirty little place under someones trailer), there Flick seeks out warrior bugs, and finds them in the form of Slim, Francis and the gang.<br/><br/>The gang, including Flick head back to ant island, where the majority of the film will now take place, ups and downs and lovely subtle comedy ensue, resulting in the island hatching a plan to take down Hopper and the evil grasshoppers.<br/><br/>Call me a baddie, but my favourite character was actually the films baddie, antagonist Hopper, he was so cool, but in a toned down kind of way, nothing genuinely nasty, like all lifeforms he's simply doing what he needs to to survive.<br/><br/>The music was typical of any Disney or Pixar film, perfect in other words, it evoked excitement and calm at the same time, never once getting out of hand or too much, perfect for kids.<br/><br/>Nature, the very essence of the plot, nothing in the story was false, every element was true to how would be in nature, only in an exaggerated way, oh so simple, to produce magic from a story so simple shows true genius, and they don't get much better than Pixar.<br/><br/>As for the ending, a little weepy for the faint hearted, as the bugs and the circus they are employed by disappear off into the sunset, their work complete, Flick, the newly appointed Queen Atta, and the newly appointed Princess Dot watch on as streams of wheat act as fireworks being propelled into the sky and the whole ant colony waves goodbye. The ending was as simple as the rest of the story, and it just worked completely.<br/><br/>Altogether an outstanding film, very enjoyable and one the whole family can watch, plus the runtime isn't too long (as with all Pixar films)."

","A Bug's Life (1998): Dir: John Lasseter / Voices: David Foley, Kevin Spacey, Denis Leary, Julia Louise-Dreyfus, David Hyde Pierce: Imaginative yet low key followup to Toy Story. Title suggests hardship with an ant colony under ruling by a gang of ruthless grasshoppers. One of the ants ventures for help and returns with a group of circus performing insects. Predictable events follow. Flick is the ant who foils everything. The new Queen fears failure. A spider creates anything from her web. Frances the ladybug has an identity problem. Directed by John Lasseter who made the previously mentioned Toy Story. Here he is backed with the same innovative images only this time the screenplay is much weaker. Voices by David Foley as Flik who is the low ant on the poll who has big hopes. He attempts to pull together help using deceit as an aid but we know his heroic fate. Kevin Spacey as Hopper the grasshopper leader is cardboard and uninteresting. Denis Leary as Francis the lady bug is perhaps the most interesting with his identity issue with perhaps the best lines. Julia Louis-Dreyfus as the Princess is pretty straight forward and dull. David Hyde Pierce voices a walking stick insect appropriately named Slim. While writing is weak families will no doubt enjoy its humour. It contains a strong theme of talents assisting in its animated world. Score: 5 / 10"

","Disney and Pixar studios team up once again and brought us an imaginative adventure story about a misfit ant named Flik, who accidentally drops the food offerings his colony gathers for the fierce gang of grasshoppers, leaving his fellow ants to gather twice as much food for the fierce bugs. To help his colony rid their land of the hopping menace, Flik tries to seeks out warrior bugs that would help out but, instead, he unknowingly returns to the colony with a circus crew.<br/><br/>This is filmed in brilliant and colorful computer animation - very detailed and realistic as it cleverly shows a bug's world from their point of view. The story is full of adventure, from Flik running into the flea circus to the ants trying to defend themselves from the grasshoppers. The movie is also filled with comedy; you will have to watch the movie to appreciate the bug humor and, of course, it's typical for a Disney animated movie that the filmmakers would make the ladybug character a guy in the story.<br/><br/>There are some slow plot points in the first half of the movie, especially during Flik's solo scenes, but the plot picks up steam during the second half, especially when the circus and ants conjure up the plan to defeat the grasshoppers. It is also notable that the film concentrates on redemption, endurance and never-say-die attitude of the ant colony, proving that even the ""little guys"" are ferocious and determined.<br/><br/>Just like the Toy Story movies, this animated film will make you suspend your disbelief and expand your imagination.<br/><br/>Grade B"

"Stompgal_87","9","0","0","6 July 2014"," More memorable than 'Antz' but not quite as good as 'Toy Story'
","I first saw this film when my aunt purchased it whilst visiting her. The first part I remember laughing at very hard was P.T. Flea telling his troupe of circus bugs they were fired after a fire at the circus. I've re-visited this film a few more times since my first viewing and whilst watching it on Amazon Prime Instant Video this morning, I laughed at it more than I have done for ages. I know how easy it is for people to compare this to 'Antz' but I find this more memorable than 'Antz' if not quite as entertaining as the 'Toy Story' franchise.<br/><br/>The animation is just as good as that in the first 'Toy Story' film with the ants looking more colourful if more cartoonish than those in 'Antz,' the grasshoppers looking more realistic, luscious natural backgrounds and a creative use of junk to make it look like a city. The water droplets were also well-made. It wasn't until today's viewing that I noticed this film was loosely based on Aesop's fable 'The Ant and the Grasshopper' and the story is pretty straightforward in terms of Flik searching for more bugs to help the colony gather more food for the grasshoppers after he accidentally knocks the first batch into the stream. Other parts I found funny were Harry getting zapped by the bug light and one glow-ant telling the other to turn his butt off. The dialogue is memorable for the most part with some funny and clever lines. I liked the use of ""Bug-eat-bug world"" as opposed to ""Dog-eat-dog world"" as well as a mosquito ordering an O-positive Bloody Mary at the bar. While there were only two songs used in the entire film, I liked Randy Newman's closing credits song but the most memorable piece of incidental music was unfortunately the most repetitive since it was used about four times throughout the film to accompany scenes such as Flik setting out to find more bugs, Flik returning with the circus bugs and the ending. The voice acting is very good. Dave Foley, although lesser known, gave Flik his touch of ambition and determination; Julia Louis-Dreyfus, also lesser known, gave Princess Atta heart; Kevin Spacey was menacing as Hopper; and Hayden Panettiere, who later went on to play Channing in 'Racing Stripes' and cheerleader Claire in television series 'Heroes,' was cute as Dot. I also liked the late Joe Ranft's German accent for Heimlich and John Ratzenberger was virtually unrecognisable as P.T. Flea but did a good job voicing him nonetheless. <br/><br/>Overall, this didn't entertain me quite as much as the 'Toy Story' franchise did but it is better than its accompanying short film 'Geri's Game' and 'Antz.' 9/10."

","An ant named Flik messes with the food offering for grasshoppers and is forced to search for ""warrior bugs"" to fight them. How fun! The movie is quite enjoyable, and I now realize there were some jokes I never got when I was a child and that I see now almost everyday. But I don't really think kids must watch adult jokes like ""Hey, cutie! Wanna polinize with a real bug?"" It can be also referred to homosexuality. Oh, well, let's put that aside. Some precocious child can understand some not-so-good scenes, seeing that the only I really got as a child were the violent ones. That's not really suitable for young kids. Anyhow, older viewers' eyes will be stick in the relationship between Flik and Dot. That is so cute! I really enjoyed the father/older brother relationship Flik has with Dot, and the motivational line ""Pretend that's a seed"" is with me since I was 8 years old. That's so awesome!

Great voice acting from an all-star cast, a few good jokes for every age range, villains that manage to be threatening but not terrifying and a plot that's simple enough to draw anybody in, but deep enough to snag them for the duration.

From some slapstick for the kids (Flick crashes into the river bed rocks)... to inside ""bug humor"" (the grasshopper with a sign ""Kid pulled my wing's off"") for those who understand more about the bug world. It's got jokes throughout the entire movie... even up to Heimlich sprouting little wings and saying ""From up here you all look little ants."" haha Not only are the visuals strikingly real in many places, but to take things down to the world of bugs creates a fascinating perspective on things. From raindrops that are like bombs to the ""city life"" of a country house's junk pile. ""This stop, Deeeeead Rat!"" Yes! All this, and more, from a ""kid's movie.""

","A Bug's Life is the story of Flik, an ant, and his colony of ants. The colony has to each year gather food for the grasshoppers, mainly Hopper and his gang. Flik seems to mess up everything unknowingly, in a way that is endearing. And somehow his ""inventions"" don't seem to work and the more he tries the more he fails. When Flik upsets the pile of food that the ants have been collecting for Hopper all summer, he realises that he's really done it this time. Hopper arrives, scares them to high heavens, and messes with their minds - he gives them ""one last chance"". The ants, terrified, start collecting food again, this time double the load. As well as double food for Hopper, they need to start collecting for themselves. But it's late summer and there isn't much left to pick, feeling guilty, and coming up with a huge plan, Flik offers to travel to city, round up some tough warrior bugs, return, and fight off Hopper and his crew. The Ant Queen, Princess Atta (for whom Flik has a massive crush) and the other ants all agree to this - but only because they want Flik out of their way! Flik is determined to make a difference and give something back to his colony, but can he do it? Can he redeem himself and save his colony from Hopper? And if he does, how? <br/><br/>I thought A Bug's Life addressed bullying, and is the only animated film from Pixar to have done so. Even many Disney films have not addressed bullying so openly and easily. A Bug's Life, though subtle, addresses an issue.<br/><br/>The animation is STUNNING. I am a great fan of animated movies, especially by Pixar, and I think this is one of their best. Finding Nemo, Toy Story, The Incredibles, Monsters Inc. to name a few, A Bug's Life still remains as a classic Pixar animation, despite being one of their oldest movies. I thought the animation of the ants was done well, but better than that, was the landscape, and background. Each leaf was perfect, each stem defined and textured.<br/><br/>What I like most about A Bug's Life is that it makes you feel as if you know the ants, as they live a similar life to you.

Ask for A BUG'S LIFE, which tells the story of a colony of ants, bullied by a swarm of grasshoppers, who has nothing to do but lay around, is a less complicated plot. Thus, A BUG'S LIFE is the movie to show the kids more often, while ANTZ will be the adults'.<br/><br/>I'm not just rating A BUG'S LIFE high because it's a terrific animated film.

","Flik is a different,strange, an individualist a would-be inventor in a colony of ants that is persecuted by a gang of predatory grasshoppers, which arrive once a season demanding food from the ants. While working with an invention(a harvesting tool that could make things easier for ants to pick fruit more efficiently, Flik unintentionally destroys the offering that the ants were putting together to ward off the grasshoppers. Given a temporary reprieve by the grasshoppers, the ants agree to Flik's plan to find ""warrior bugs"" to fight off the grasshoppersFlik actually believes the plan, while the other ants see it as effectively exiling Flik.And right there when Flick starts a travel we start on a journey of animation for fun not just for kids but it's also a fun for many adults! I read some negative reviews here on IMDb on grounds that this animation is not entertaining for adults.Well I disagree.Maybe it's based on a cliché: The good beats the bad. Maybe it's a retelling of Aesop's fable of The Ant and the Grasshopper.But still the animations have a great artistic value.And I really liked it. Some people may not like the moralizing side of the movie for an adult but you can find moralizing in anything you meet in this life."

","Pixar created one of the best animation-films of the last years. The movie is pleasant not only for children, but also for adults. It is an adventure story with successful jokes and quite interesting and amusing characters. Flik, the goofer but brave and stubborn ant, Hopper, the satanic and wild chief of the locusts and the overstrung princess Atta are really hard to forget. The director John Lasseter and the co-director Andrew Stanton, who have also created the screenplay of the movie, are two of the best professionals in the Pixar Animation Studios. The ""Bug's life"" is the second long picture of Pixar after the successful ""Toy story I"" in cooperation with Walt Disney."

","This is one of the best films of 1998.<br/><br/>It's about a colony of ants who made a deal and forced to gather a large pile of food for a gang of grasshoppers every year.

"dustybooks","9","0","0","19 January 2005"," the real beginning of something
","I saw A BUG'S LIFE after having already become a fan of the other five Pixars, and what struck me about it was the profound sophistication, subtlety, and sheer complexity of the storytelling. It may be the studio's least immediate film, but it grows with time thanks to what amounts to a kind of minimalism. It's less flashy and bombastic that any other cartoon feature I can remember; its dramatic peak arrives with the placement of a rock on the ground.<br/><br/>The SEVEN SAMURAI-inspired story couldn't be farther from the Andrew Lloyd Webberish monotony of the trite Disney features that have arrived in the last few years. A BUG'S LIFE dares to be intricate and unsentimental (a welcome characteristic in most of the Pixar features), and it becomes a sweeping epic with some light but cutting humor and a sense of journey that should make repeat viewings a treat even for the parents forced to sit through it over and over.<br/><br/>What's more, the voice acting is terrific, with an excellent performance by David Foley and a no-holds-barred, terrifying turn from Kevin Spacey, who is far closer to his SE7EN character than to K-PAX world in this G-rated film. I haven't even mentioned the animation, which in a world of fast-moving technical advancement at this studio and everywhere still looks astounding seven years later.<br/><br/>All the Pixar movies are surprising, but A BUG'S LIFE has a creative spark that completely blindsides the viewer. The plotty bits can drag slightly, especially those involving the circus crew, usually far less interesting than the lead character and villain, but no matter. These vivid characters and an absorbing story make for almost peerless entertainment."

","A BUG'S LIFE / Starring David Foley, Julia-Louis Dreyfus and Kevin Spacey / Directed by John Lasseter / Written by John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton and Joe Ranft / Rated G / *** 1/2<br/><br/>A Bug's Life, for me, never reaches the height of humor, wit and emotion as the Pixar perfects like Toy Story 1-2, Monsters, Inc. or even their latest masterpiece Finding Nemo. I'd say it's the weakest of the Pixar films. However, with it still being a Pixar production, it is probably one of the better children's flicks made in 1998. It's still better than the somewhat forgettable Antz and is even maybe a bit more 'adult' than the others (besides the Toy Story movies). Inspired by Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai, A Bug's Life is one heck of a wild ride into the world of computer animation.<br/><br/>Flik (David Foley) is a lone ant living with his colony on Ant Island who's not really friends with anyone. He seems to always mess things up. You see, in the buggy bug world of this movie, ants collect food over the seasons to feed to the greedy and bullying grasshoppers, lead by the menacing Hopper (Kevin Spacey). When Flik messes up, Hopper commands the ants to give him and his gang twice as much food as before or they'll be tearing up Ant Island. Commanded by Princess Atta (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), Flik journeys across the world of insects and finally comes along with a gang of circus bugs. However, will these circus bugs be any help the army of grasshoppers?<br/><br/>The film is probably more visually-impressive than Pixar's previous Toy Story was never reaches the brilliant animation of Finding Nemo. The facial animation particularly is amazing compared to first Toy movie. It didn't seem so much like computer animation than a fully-realized world. Even the backdrops and set animation was a joy to look at. Bug's Life has a little more freedom than Toy Story in terms of animation simply because of it's setting. This movie unravels a world, much like the other Pixar films, where anything is possible. It just has a lot more to do, being in the open earth instead of being stuck in a kid's bedroom. <br/><br/>The film's main problem is that it just isn't as imaginative as Toy Story, Monsters, Inc. or even the splashy fish tale Finding Nemo. There is a joyful little scene where Flik searches a bug city of gigantic proportions (for us, minature proportions) for warrior bugs to lend a hand against the grasshoppers. This scene is probably the best that appears. Bugs of every shape and size (even a towering spider) move and act like in a normal city, buildings being replaced by cracker boxes and empty pop bottles. Even a tin can acts as a bug bar. This, however, is the only scene bursting with imagination, on the other hand Monsters, Inc. and Toy Story 2 have millions of sequences full of wit. Much of the movie features ants and the group of circus bugs. Finding Nemo has countless new things to look at in every scene.<br/><br/>However, it still is Pixar, it still is a marvel of pacing and is still a marvel of beauty. When Pixar creates a movie, the movie is sure to be an instant classic, and A Bug's Life is no exception. Much like Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli, Pixar cranks out masterpieces like first-class restaurants dish out food. It comes so quick and the meal is so nourishing and delicious that you're just craving more. Hopefully this studio has another twenty or thirty films in need of releasing. Sooner or later Pixar will notice that Disney are only the training wheels and when they're ready, they'll be hammering them to the ground. Nowadays, Disney's films are a bit more forgetable yet Pixar's are bursting with classical magic, much like Disney in their golden years. Let's just hope they stay forever."

","I first saw Dave Foley when he was doing ""Kids In The Hall"". I thought he was a comic genius.

Julia-Louis Dreyfus (who was brilliant on ""Seinfeld"") is a truly horrid princess and I found myself rooting for Kevin Spacey in the Atta/Hopper scenes.<br/><br/>Though, It must be pointed out that Dave Foley was not the only one who had a hand in saving the picture.

"kamerad","8","0","0","2 July 2002"," Light Years
","The feature ""A Bug's Life"" shows the light years Lasseter's art had jumped in only ten regular years since ""Luxo Jr."".  No longer are the qualities of the faces affected by symmetrical shapes.  In ""Tin Toy"", Tinny was cute, but his face was a perfect sphere.  The baby was supposed to be cute, but because his face could not be perfectly round and still seem realistic, his face was ruined by unintended harsh angles that were supposed to give the baby a more ""human"" look.  In ""A Bug's Life"", we now have cute ants whose faces are not perfectly spherical, yet are not ruined.  The lines and bends in their faces and bodies are smooth and flexible.  The sharp features that made the baby so sinister looking are reserved for the evil grasshoppers. The scene where Hopper is about to crush Flick's head is frightening not only because of what is happening, but because of the intense looks of anger/pleasure on Hopper's face, and the extreme fear on Flick's face. <br/><br/>
     It's not only the characters that make ""A Bugs Life"" a triumph.  We see how far we've come since ""Luxo Jr."" when it was too risky to move the camera.  Now the camera swoops and swirl through the air.  The high-speed chase in the rain is particularly stunning.  The rain adds added atmosphere, as well as a way to indicate just how fast they are flying.  As the camera bobs up and down as it rushes through space, we can hardly believe that this is not real.  I think it works better than a live action chase, because there is not that awkward mix between special effects and reality.  Because ""A Bugs Life"" is all special effects, it is it's own reality"
"chrisbrown6453","8","0","0","17 May 2002"," Much better than Antz!!!
","Ahh... The Disney/Pixar magic is back. I waited three years for A Bug's Life, and it did not disappoint. Unlike it's direct competition, Antz, A Bug's Life is a light hearted, fun filled adventure directed at kids, but good enough for adults. Flik (voice of Dave Foley) is an ant. And like all ants in his colony, he picks grains and fruits all year long. And once a year, the bad grasshoppers, lead by Hopper (voice of Kevin Spacey) come to the colony and take all the grain. The ants just accept this as their way of life. But one day Flik decides to do something different. He figures if the ants can recruit bigger and badder insects, they can scare the grasshoppers away, and keep all the food for themselves. So he heads to the ""big city"" to find some really tough bugs. Unfortunately for him, he finds some circus bugs who he thinks are tough. But he brings them back to the colony, and through the magic of luck, they manage to scare the grasshoppers away.<br/><br/>Obviously everyone and their mother is going to compare A Bug's Life to that other bug movie that came out a couple months before. The biggest difference is that the other movie was aimed more at the adult crowd, while this movie is aimed towards kids. The characters are cuter, funnier, and more fun. With characters like Flik, and Dot, and Tuck & Roll (my favorites), A Bug's Life makes it fun to go to the movies. I didn't have any fun when I saw Antz. With Woody Allen's neurotic attitude, and all those dead bugs, I felt like I was watching an animated war film. With A Bug's Life, I felt like I was watching a light-hearted comedy with spectacular animation. I honestly felt that at times I was really watching bugs in my backyard. It felt so real it was amazing. And another thing I've come to realize, even in animation, it's important to have a story that people want to see. Now I realize Antz made a lot of money, but I'm not sure why. With A Bug's Life I felt like a kid again. I cheered for the good bugs, and booed the bad bugs. The circus bugs were cutely drawn, and the voices matched the bugs perfectly. Woody Allen as an ant just didn't fly for me. But David Hyde-Pierce as a stick bug was perfect. Basically what I'm saying is, if you want to see what real animation is about, a good story, fun characters, good voices, and most of all a good time, rent A Bug's Life. Besides, you get two pluses. One, they showed Pixar's 1997 Academy Award winning animation short, Geri's Game before the movie, and they had these hilarious ""outtakes"" during the closing credits. Quite possibly the funniest thing I've seen. So have a good time..."

But this one, like TOY STORY, the previous film from Pixar, is a lot of fun.  The two lead characters were perhaps a bit too bland(especially compared to the two leads in ANTZ, but otherwise this film is better), but the rest of the film more than made up for it.  The animation looked great, the humor, though broad, was consistently good(I especially liked Hopper's line ""If I hadn't promised Mother on her deathbed that I wouldn't kill you, I would kill you!""), and the actors doing the voices, except the two leads, were all terrific(Denis Leary doing an animated movie; what a concept).

","A Bug's Life considers a number of the same themes (individuality vs. utilitarianism, for example) that are found in Antz, but the Disney/Pixar film stays more firmly rooted in the breezy, family-friendly zone than the Dreamworks competition.  I agree with the critic who suggested that spinning The Seven Samurai into a children's story featuring insects was a stroke of genius.  And few would disagree that the samurai, here made over into a circus of misfit bugs, provide the most colorful moments in the movie.  The non-English speaking duo of Tuck and Roll, voiced by Michael McShane, were perfectly realized by their animators, who captured a hilarious vacancy on their faces as they listened but didn't comprehend what was being said to them.

Second: In my eyes, the similarity to ""Three Amigos"" is incredible, even shocking. They should have dropped a word about that. But: Great graphics, great movements (the bird looks so real!), nice dialogue. Entertaining, but too many sidekicks. Not to mention that there are too many (or too less, depending on the viewpoint) main characters.

","Yes, as you've probably heard A Bug's Life is heaps more entertaining than its rival Antz.<br/><br/>A Bug's Life is themed in a similar way to Antz with a misfit ant saving the colony from threat but Antz is a self conscious Manhattan political whinge whereas A Bug's Life is bright and just funny, in the full Disney tradition. A Bug's Life is a great film to take the children to, or perhaps to even attend by yourself, without having to leave half way through to take the tyke to the toilet or to get the little bugger more popcorn.<br/><br/>A Bug's Life was made by the same mob who brought us the amazing Toy Story; amazing from a technical point of view anyway. I'm no expert on animation but it appears that matt, painted backgrounds were often used in A Bug's Life, whereas all of the backgrounds were digitally produced in Toy Story, which must have been hellishly expensive.<br/><br/>Antz also has a glossier, more exquisite look to it than A Bug's Life, but we all know that some of the funniest stuff on film has been pretty roughly produced. Remember those great old Chaplin or Keaton films. Technology can't compensate for poor actors or a lousy script. And slapstick will win out more often than more sophisticated humour.<br/><br/>Our hero ant in A Bug's Life is a crazy inventor who heads off to bug city to get some help to fight off some stand over grasshoppers. In the tradition of The Seven Samurai or The Magnificent Seven he brings back warriors to help the  folks back home out but he's unfortunately  picked a no hope band of travelling entertainer bugs, thinking that they are the bee's knees at fighting. And yes that is Phyllis Diller's voicing the Queen.<br/><br/>Of course the good blokes and sheilas win out, the colony is saved from the grasshoppers and it's a lot of fun along the way. A Bug's Life is inventive, lively and often downright funny. It's a top notch Disney cartoon comedy."

"Tenzin-3","Null","0","0","29 November 1998"," Disappointing follow-up to Toy Story
","With all the hype surrounding A Bug's Life and the phenomenal success of Toy Story, I had pretty high expectations for A Bug's Life.<br/><br/>It is inevitable that A Bug's Life is going to be compared to Antz, the animated Woody Allen vehicle which came out a couple of months before. I was surprised to find that I enjoyed Antz more. Animation aside, the stories are amazingly similar: underdog ant triupmphs and saves the day! While the  story line of Antz was engaging, A Bug's Life seemed just a little too predictable. Both stories are thinly veiled morality tales but A Bug's Life is practically transparent. The characters aren't as well developed and the plot is rather weak.<br/><br/>Unlike Toy Story which was driven by the excellent plot, and featured the most amazing computer animation ever to hit the big screen, A Bug's Life seemed to be driven by the animation. And as everybody knows whose seen a sci-fi flick that has an over-reliance on special effects, the effects just can't carry the movie. The same can be said of animation. While the animation in A Bug's Life is excellent-despite the over-use of pastel colors to depict the ants-the story lags behind. Not only that, it doesn't have the same cross-over appeal as Toy Story. That is, it seems to appeal more to children than adults, in contrast to Toy Story which appealed just as much to all ages.<br/><br/>I went to see the film with the same friend that I'd seen Antz with. Going into the film she was ready to buy stock in Pixar. She also guessed that she'd probably want to see the film more than once. When we walked out, she decided that once was enough after all, and that left over change was going to be invested somewhere else besides Pixar. Sorry Steve.

The experience starts with a short Pixar animation entitled Geri's Game, which won the 1997 Academy Award for Best Short Film. This film itself was amazing. As for the actual movie, it combines a good story, a good lesson, and great animation for an all-around great package. The casting of the voices was brilliant. You can recognize who the celebrities behind the voices are at first, but it takes very little time before their voices are permanently the possessions of their characters. The greatest thing I liked from A Bug's Life, along with all animations, is the attention to detail.

","I saw ""Antz"" in 1998 at cinema and I thought it was a wonderful computer animated movie. Since I am a Woody Allen fan, I have found it a very good idea to give Woody's character to the 'hero' ant. I wanted to check ""A Bug's Life"" at cinema, but I thought it couldn't be better than ""Antz"" and it was advertised as a real children film, so I didn't want to be disappointed. Now I know I was wrong. There are several good surprises in this wonderful film. Firstly, there are no stupid songs in it, which are just slow the story down (don't forget this is a Disney production, until ""Atlantis"" it was compulsory to put songs in Disney animations). Secondly the sophisticated irony and the humor. Of course its less sarcastic than ""Antz"" because it was made for children but adults can enjoy it very much, too. The animation is fantastic, I'm sure the other comment writers have written dozens of lines about it, so I don't want to go into details, but I have to say that nothing can replace real drawings. I know this is a computer animated movie and I might seem conservative, but that's the only thing I miss from this picture. Maybe that's why I prefer ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" & ""James and the Giant Peach"". It's sure this is my second favourite animated film after ""The Iron Giant"" and from technical point of view it surpasses ""Antz"". The only thing I would like to draw the attention to is during the end titles where you can see the collection of the ""faulted scenes"". It's one of the best gag of the animation history.

","I would have never thought anyone other than Miyazaki could (or would) make an animated remake of a Kurosawa movie aimed at children, but that's exactly what PIXAR and John Lasseter have done.<br/><br/>Does it work?  Yes and no.<br/><br/>Yes, because the child-friendly changes to the plot are interesting and rather Aesopian, since it is also an extended version of the ant and the grasshopper fable.  There are great references to the Magnificent Seven, and the pageant the little ants (especially the picture of one of them dying ""because our teacher said it would be more dramatic"") is hilarious.<br/><br/>No, because the seven-plus-two warrior bugs that Flick gets are stock characters, and only the ladybug has any resemblance to any previous incarnation (he is basically the Mifune character--he is ridiculed by others not for being a peasant instead of a samurai but because he is a male ladybug, and also he is the one who befriends the children).  There is not a stoic character like Yul Brenner or Takashi Shimura to lead the pack, which I find a bit of an oversight (the praying mantis is hardly stoic in my opinion).<br/><br/>The animation is truly astounding, with beautiful scenery and ""camera"" shots.  This is Pixar's most Miyazaki-esque film, which is why I like it so much (look for homages to Laputa and Kiki).  In spite of this, I have to rank A Bug's Life below the Toy Story movies because of the ludicrous slapstick beginning that sets the plot in motion--the same sort of annoying joke that Disney deemed necessary to push the plot forward in Mulan (Mushu shooting off a rocket for no apparent reason) and Tarzan (the elephant stampede) when they were stuck for a logical reason.  Would it have been too much to ask for Flick to actually have been a hero?  What if, as bandits often do, they go down the anthole anyway just to harass them and make them work harder for them--then just have the movie go just as it is--the grasshoppers pick on Princess Dot, Flick tells them to leave her alone, and then Hopper orders double the order for next time and everybody starts worrying about that.  Flick could be banished for that reason--sort of like what happens in Princess Mononoke when Ashitaka saves the girls but gets cursed and so has to leave and never return.<br/><br/>One other complaint--Dot believing she can and should be able to fly before her body is ready is an outright dangerous concept for Pixar to condone, despite society's current mentality towards girl-power and the ""youth are always right"" generation.  Knowing what your limits are is as much a part of strength as anything else.<br/><br/>8/10"

","Even though A Bugs Life got a half star less than Antz I like it better because it is funnier in my opinion (comedy movies are my favorite). At the beginning of the movie Flik (main character) caused the grain to fall in a creek and the ants did not have enough food for the grasshoppers. Their leader Hopper gave the ants until ""the last leaf fell"" to get ""double the order of food"". I enjoy to watch Fliks adventure to find ""warrior"" bugs to fight the grasshoppers and save the ants. Unfortunately Flik came back to ""Ant Island"" and with circus bugs. They were a combination of insects like a Lady Bug (Francis) a Black Widow Spider (Rosie), and others. Flik found out about this misunderstanding and the circus bugs were about to leave but when they saved Dot (Queen Ants little daughter) they decided to stay. About half way through the movie Flik and Princess Atta fall in love (that was cool). Flik comes up with another plan to build a bird (Hopper is afraid of birds) and scare Hopper and the rest of the grasshoppers away. Soon after the bird was complete all the other ants find out the truth about the ""circus bugs"" (because of P.T. Fleas big mouth) and Princess Atta orders Flik to leave and never return. Flik was sad but he and the circus bugs came back to the Ant Island when Dot told flik that Hopper was going to kill the Queen Ant (the grasshoppers came back to Ant Island and the ants did not have enough food). When Flik came back and put the built bird plan to action it scared off all of the grasshoppers except Hopper who found out that the bird was fake. He went after Flik in a rage. When Princess Atta took Flik away from Hopper they ended up right by a birds nest. That was the final showdown between Flik and Hopper. Lets just say that Hopper got fed to three baby birds. In the end the circus bugs returned to the circus, Flik and Princess Atta are together, and everybody live happily ever after.

Dave Foley sounds a little too starry-eyed, which is a little out of character for his usual, pessimistic self seen in ""Newsradio"" and his various ""Kids In The Hall"" characters.

","While not as absolutely perfect as the ""Toy Story"" movies (indeed, that's a very tough act to follow), ""A Bug's Life"" is very enjoyable movie.  It's one of the very few animated movies that works well for adults and kids, the script is incredibly well written, and the artwork is bright and adorable. <br/><br/>
I want to make one last comment on that last aspect.  This summer, a lot of noise was made about how Disney's inventively titled (I hope you can all hear the sarcasm dripping off of that statement) non-Pixar-involving (and man, did that make a difference) computer animation -err- ""movie"" (""Dinosaur"", if you haven't guessed yet) had backgrounds that were real live-action footage.  Only the characters were animated.  Well, watching ""Bug's Life"" again, I have to ask, what was the point?  The backgrounds in ""Bug's"" are stunningly beautiful, and the characters interact with them convincingly.  The characters (if you can call them that) in ""Dinosaur"" were less convincing than the animated creatures in a Ray Harryhausen movie. Much less.  There's a lesson to be learned here."

Along with the beauty, this is a fun family film. <br/><br/>Pixar continues to capture a child's eye with this story. Things go from magical to silly very quickly. They have an excellent comic flair. This is best shown with the grasshopper bad guys. There are touching moments but always with a light touch.<br/><br/>A Bug's Life will always be compared to Antz because they came out the same year and seem to have similar stories. But look deeper and they are very different films. Antz is Woody Allen's show surrounded by mediocre, muddy looking animation. A Bug's Life looks better. Antz's dialogue is really at an adult level. While A Bug's life continues the long Disney family tradition but updated in the Pixar way. <br/><br/>I especially liked the circus act, Kevin Spacey as Hopper, the living scenery and the out takes at the end which are very clever.

The animation is gorgeous, and the characterizations are wonderful. Aside from the German caterpillar, who thankfully isn't overplayed, the circus performers are a hilarious group, totally dysfunctional but memorable.  And John Ratzenberger as PT Flea has a voice that begs to be used in animated films. David Foley's Flik is a bit bland, and it's not easy to become involved in his fate.  He's earnest, but the wackiness of the character never really comes across.  Some of the comic pieces, especially the pageant for the warriors done by the ant second graders and the circus performance of 'flaming death' absolutely slew me.  The depiction of the bug city to which Flik journeys to find the warrior bugs is worth the price of admission on its own.  The film is full of wonderful throwaway lines and scenes that kept me interested and entertained.<br/><br/>If the film has a weakness, it is that the grasshoppers just don't seem that threatening.  Deep down I continued to wonder why the ants just didn't do away with them.  They work their butts off to pick food for the grasshoppers when it is apparent that they should simply fight them off.  I also agreed with the grasshoppers who didn't want to go back to Ant Island from Mexico: it didn't seem necessary.  I think more needed to have been made of this conflict, and that the grasshoppers should have been played less for laughs. Kevin Spacey as Hopper just never comes across as sufficiently evil.<br/><br/>I gave it 8 out of 10, which is a bit generous for this film, but I liked it in spite of its flaws.

","This cross between Lion King and The Three Amigos is pretty standard Disney fare. The ant colony suffers from exploitation by grasshoppers. The inventor-ant, the usual misfit/outsider, is sent to find macho bugs to fight the grasshoppers. Of course, it is expected that he will never return. What he finds instead is a group of circus bugs. Per the usual Disney formula, all the outsiders bring their unusual talents to win the day.<br/><br/>The animation was done by Pixar (of Toy Story fame). But this film doesn't make your eyes pop the way Toy Story Did. Partially the repetitiveness of the landscapes (lots of blades of grass) and the sameness of many of the characters (most of the ants and grasshoppers look the same) limit the potential for wild effects. Even the visit to the bug ""city"" does not have the intended effect. Instead of a lost country ant in a Manhattan-like urban landscape, we have an ant standing in front of a billboard.<br/><br/>Despite these shortcomings (in my mind) this will certainly please the kids. All the elements are there (but it's not a musical, thank God) and the story moves along at a good pace. The dangers are not overly scary, the circus bits are very funny, and there is some very creative use of the bug's eye perspective.

","A high-quality animated movie that expands upon Aesop's fable about the ant & grasshopper and intertwines it with other story lines (relationships, protecting the homefront, etc...).

"WeslyM","9","0","0","3 May 1999"," More of a kid-flick than ""Antz""
","""A Bug's Life"" is clearly oriented more toward children than is ""Antz."" The story is more kid-accessible, and the characters as well as the overall style have a much higher ""cute"" factor.  (For example, consider the fundamental decision to make the ants in ""A Bug's Life"" light blue and lavender, while comparable characters in ""Antz"" are more mundane shades of brown.)  The central and supporting characters are a varied assortment of different insects, which makes for easy identification and increased toy sales.  The voice casting is a delight: Phyllis Diller is an absolute hoot as the ant queen; Kevin Spacey embodies sheer villainy as the head grasshopper meanie; David Hyde-Pierce gives dry voice to a worldly, jaded walking-stick.  Gary Rydstrom's sound design is remarkably rich and detailed, putting the viewer right in the middle of each meadow, underground anthill, and grasshopper swarm.  The story makes some of the same points concerning individuality and cooperation as does ""Antz,"" and they are no less meaningful (although perhaps a bit less original) for having been heard before.  If possible, Pixar's animation is even better than PDI's outstanding work in ""Antz.""  Exterior shots are unbelievably detailed, with single leaves visible being blown by wind in the trees and individual clusters of clover leaves weaving and bending as the bugs hop across them. ""A Bug's Life"" is a riotous, rollicking roller-coaster ride of a flick.  I saw it in a theater full of families with kids, and a good time was had by all.  The hilarious ""outtakes"" over which the end credits roll are an especially imaginative touch."

","Wow... this film was a big disappointment. Yes, Pixar is the vanguard of companies producing computer-generated feature films; A Bug's Life is one of the most visually stimulating, unreal yet real animated films I have ever seen.  Kevin Spacey's Hopper crackled with  intensity and I was sure he was actually taking up space on the screen. The bird was far more terrifying than any other villain - it was simply a mindless killer, a mechanical crusher of dreams. (Watch the 'bloopers' at the end for a nod to Jaws)<br/><br/>I would have, however, preferred to have watched A Bug's Life without sound.  Every character was a clichÃ¨ and I think the plot was lifted from an old episode of Three's Company.  Why bother with that sort of limp, trite trash when I can flip on the Idiot box and watch 24 hours of the same?<br/><br/>As in ANTZ, the main characters lack any charisma.... Sure, in an attempt to keep the story somewhat plausible the ants are all identical, but as in Toy Story, the most entertaining characters were those marginally associated or appearing late in the story : the boozing, rat-racing bugs of the city and the neurotic circus rejects.<br/><br/>At least there was no Sharon Stone in this one.<br/><br/>Finally, I'd like to add a question. Who are these wild, slave bugs/animals we see in every disney feature since 1930?  The insane, rabid grasshopper- is there no explanation for why he is a drooling, snarling beast among fun loving layabouts?  And P.T. Flea's Centipedes?  Are they at least paid? It's an outrage!

","I was invited to see this movie with my half-sister and her son.  I decided to go but I wasn't that crazy about the movie at first.  Not to say I was prejudiced from the start.  I love kids movies if they are done right and have a little depth to them.  I also like special effects movies if there is a worthwhile plot.<br/><br/>Still, I was pretty underwhelmed by this movie.  I did not like the characters very much.  I love Dave Foley in Newsradio and the casting of him as an ant was pretty straight on.  Still there weren't any interesting facets to his character.  The smallest princess ant was very annoying. There is also something about the way their faces move.  I keep hearing that this film was such a landmark in computer animation.  That may be true but the characters still looked like lifeless puppets.  That could have been forgiven if the plot was worthwhile.  It lagged all the way.  The whole idea of a circus of bugs wasn't that interesting.  It was just an excuse to bring in some of the more exotic type insects.<br/><br/>I do admit that the movie looked good, but it was all overly pastel and Disney styled.  Leave the movie before the ""outtakes"" start.  Outtakes are very tricky.  Sometimes they can be funny.  Most of the time they are the sort of ""you had to be there"" type funny.  I have never managed to laugh when seeing an outtake of someone forgetting their lines.  ""Oh, funny, you forgot your lines, ha ha""  What's worse, A Bug's Life adds fake outtakes at the end.  What a lame idea!<br/><br/>In closing, your kids will love this movie.  It's got pretty colors and occasionally breathtaking scenes, but this is all just wallpaper.  It lacks energy and imagination.  You will be yawning by the second or third time your kid asks to see it."

My whole family came away from the film, awed, entertained, dazzled, and happy. We're still quoting little anecdotes from it here and there. The children LOVED it and so did we (hubbie and I are 36 and 32, respectively)!<br/><br/>Apart from its beautiful and striking animation, the characters (small as they may be, and imaginary as they are) are very well developed. There isn't one of them that you cannot empathize with. The personalities bringing these little creatures to life are well casted voice talents, combined with the skill and artistry of some of Disney's best animators. This is a film worthy of Walt Disney, himself. I think Mr. Disney would heartily approve of this new film... Flick, Dot and their fellow band of tiny heroes may become as popular as Mickey and Minnie in our time.<br/><br/>This is one the family leaves the theatre wanting to see again.. and buy to own on video or DVD.

","This animated feature about ants, grasshoppers, and various other bugs is a testament of never giving up despite the odds. The story begins as Flick, voiced by Dave Foley, the ant who always invents things one right after the other. After the grasshoppers come to invade the food supply, Flick comes up with the idea of getting warrior bugs to fight the grasshoppers. Not only will this idea give Flick respect it will allow him to get redemption as he has messed his prior invention up. This epic journey starts as Flick goes in search of the warrior bugs; he finds them in Circus bugs. Consumed for Princess Atta, voiced by Julia Louis Dreyfuss, and her approval, Flick hides the fact that these ""warriors"" are in fact circus bugs. I was smiling throughout this film because it was the one of the best animated features I've seen; in addition, this film far eclipses ANTZ because unlike ANTZ this film has a point, storyline, and direction. I recommend this movie because it allows the mind to sit down and relax and without tension watch the movie in peace.

","All of you who despaired looking at the emptiness and weaknesses of Disney Studios' last productions, here comes something that should heal your wounds... Once and for all, A Bug's life brings the proof that purely synthetic pictures conducting a good scenario provides more interest than fake ""hand-made-old-Disneys-like"" drawings (see the Lion King, Pocahontas, and all the latest productions where you sadly regret that Bambi's magical background and atmosphere are gone forever).<br/><br/>A bug's life (1001 Pattes for my fellow french cinemaniaks !) succeeds in avoiding all the imperfections that make you awaken in the middle of the movie and say ""Hey, this thing is computer generated !"". No weak parts, a tremendous effort showing its efficiency in the backgrounds and the general look of the sets, an astonishing 3D bird (close to perfection in its imitation of reality)... and that's only to mention the technical aspects.<br/><br/>The scenario, my friends, the real backbone of a motion picture, has some thickness ! Curiously, and obviously thanks to Lasseter's team, there is practically no musical sequence in A bug's life. Which means the story is long and rich enough to free itself from these 3 or 4 minutes that some kids appreciate, but most others dislike (same thing for the parents or the anime fans, like me). This movie reminded me of a really old movie featuring Steve Martin and Chevy Chase : the 3 Amigos ; it had basically the same background story (a whole mexican village living in the fear of a few bad guys hires gunmen (who finally turn to be actors) to protect them, etc...). Simple, but efficient, and brilliantly adapted to a colony of frightened ants facing the wrath of vicious insects.<br/><br/>Since Microcosmos, many movies tell tales of insects, their lives, fears and hopes, but I do think that A bug's life is the funniest and best directed of all. The humanisation process has been perfectly well achieved... And the whole audience was captivated by Flik's (aka Tilt in France) adventures.<br/><br/>A big thank you for Lasseter's team, especially for the last 30 seconds... it's so strange and great at the same time to see a whole theater caught in laughter while the bugs/actors forget their lines or hit the camera...<br/><br/>And finally, especially for those of you who have seen the french version, other congratulations go to the dubbing actors who made a great synchro work on this movie. A bug's life is a really good piece of entertainment, and I think it will soon become part of my collection of videos (a privilege granted to extremely few movies, and that's not a problem of storage room :).

ANTZ was often rather dark in tone and also featured some very inappropriate voices for a kids' film.

Would you let your kids sit next to him during the show? I would hope not, unless your kids are teens and looking to replace Soon-Yi.<br/><br/>My overall impression of A BUG'S LIFE is that it is squarely marketed to kids and the studio threw in a few bits and pieces here and there for the parents.

Both films look into groups that we usually don't think (or want to think) about and how they have to overcome the odds against their enemies.  Both films have great animation, comedy and entertainment.  This film is not as good as Toy Story just because Toy Story was the first of the computer age animation.

","I loved this film as a kid but nowadays it's not really as good as I thought it was. Not to say that it's bad but honestly it's really really hard for me to decide whether I like this movie or not. Let's talk about the good stuff first, the animation, colors, settings, and character designs are all beautiful, it definitely matches up with the cheerful tone that the film is supposed to match up with. A lot of the voices are really good ranging from Dave Foley, Kevin Spacey, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Denis Leary, Richard Kind, Jonathan Harris, David Hyde Pierce, Brad Garret, Madeline Kahn, and even some of the main Pixar guys voiced a few characters. The most memorable part of the film is the circus bugs, they are the film's biggest highlight, Denis Leary is Francis the Ladybug who's constantly mistaken for a woman, David Hyde Pierce is Slim the Stick-Bug who's always used as a prop, Brad Garret is Dim the Beetle who looks dangerous and tough but is actually a gigantic baby that's supervised by Rosy the Black Widow who's voiced by Bonnie Hunt, a pair of acrobats named Tuck and Roll who don't speak English and are my favorite characters, Jonathan Harris is Manny the Prey-Mantis who is a blind fortune-teller and is married to a gorgeous butterfly named Gypsy who's voiced by Madeline Kahn, every scene they're in is constantly hilarious, there's never a single moment involving where I would say ""that's not funny...."" or ""what was the point of that?"" Finally as mentioned in the headline for this review, the best part of the film is the fourth and final act, starting from when the last leaf falls, the grasshoppers have moved into the ant-hill and are forcing the ants to get every last drop of food on the island making them their slaves, Dot being the only ant who believes in Flik tries to convince him and the circus bugs to come back to make things right but Flik doesn't want to because the amount backlash he received from the colony after the truth about the circus bugs was revealed finally convinced him that what the colony thought of him was true, that he was a guaranteed failure who tries to make things better for people but instead always made things worse, Dot convinces Flik that it doesn't matter what people think of you, you can always achieve your goals if you just believe in yourself, thus Flik agrees to make things right by using the bird that he and the others built, at first it starts off really well but then it accidentally gets sabotaged, Hopper then forces Thumper to beat him half to death in front of everyone to teach them a lesson saying that ants were put on Earth to serve grasshoppers, but Flik convinces everyone otherwise by saying the best line in the movie, ""Ants are not meant to serve grasshoppers. I've seen these ants do great things, and year after year they somehow manage to pick food for themselves and you. So who is the weaker species? Ants don't serve grasshoppers! It's you who need us! We're a lot stronger than you say we are... And you know it, don't you?"" Hopper fed up with Flik decides to kill him himself but right when he's about to Princess Atta and the other ants become convinced that they were wrong and stand up for themselves giving us that triumphant feeling that lots of epic climaxes give us, the battle between ants and grasshoppers begins with the all the grasshoppers getting scared away and Hopper about to get shot out of a cannon, but suddenly it starts to rain, which gives Hopper the advantage of grabbing Flik to finish him off, Atta comes to the rescue and Flik thinks up a plan, he gets cornered by Hopper and right when he's about to choke him to death, a bird appears and Hopper gets fed to its babies, the film then ends with the ants saying goodbye to the circus bugs, Atta becoming queen, and Flik is declared being a true hero. But unfortunately what causes the film to go downhill really causes it to go downhill, the adviser ants, Princess Atta, and the Queen are so unbelievably obnoxious, always talking down to Flik and Dot going on about how they'll never achieve anything and this isn't just occasional insults, it happens constantly throughout most of the film, they get on my nerves to the point where it's unwatchable, they even tried to get rid of Flik by saying they'll agree to let him look for warriors when really they're just trying to get rid of him, which is why my least favorite scene is when it's revealed that the circus bugs aren't warriors, therefore the colony has to call Flik a disgrace and kick him out because they apparently would rather be slaves than listen to someone who's just misunderstood, what were they thinking? So this film is nowhere near terrible, as mentioned before the fourth act starting from when the last leaf falls is spectacular, but I just feel that the ants having to be so mean-spirited and cruel towards Flik was just way too much for me."

","I don't remember my first reaction to the film, much less all the hype that came out while the movie was in theaters. But I've watched this one a few times and I must say it gets better with each viewing. A good cast, good visuals, and lots of interesting characters. I haven't seen anything this detailed since Toy Story. It's also inspired by that fable featuring the grasshopper and the ant. I remember that story vaguely but could not find it again. Regardless of the source, if you're an insect lover, this is mandatory viewing. It may not be entirely accurate, but no movie is entirely accurate.

"Vartiainen","Null","1","2","22 February 2018"," Kurosawa would be proud?
","It's Seven Samurai... except with ants. Kinda sorta.<br/><br/>Okay, allow me to explain. A Bug's Life, the second ever Pixar film, tells about a distant and isolated ant colony who have been harassed by a swarm of grasshoppers for time immemorial. Every summer they arrive, every summer they eat their food, every summer they promise to come back. Until one day, through an unfortunate accident, there is no food for the grasshoppers to eat, and they threaten to flatten to colony unless they can gather enough food for them. Unfortunately, there's not enough time left to do so. So an unlucky ant, named Flik, volunteers to go look for help. He finds warrior bugs. Or at least he thinks he does.<br/><br/>That's a kid-friendly version of Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai. Or a kid-friendly version of The Magnificent Seven, if you're more familiar with the westernized version.<br/><br/>Of course it's not quite as cut and dry as that, but you can definitely see the inspiration behind the whole thing. And it works. It's a classic story for a reason and this is a mighty fine retelling of that. The characters are likable, the action is enjoyable, the film looks colourful and there are good morals to be learned.<br/><br/>Then again, the computer effects have not aged particularly well. The grasshoppers still look menacing and scary, but the ants look plasticky, the backgrounds belong in a low-budget video game and overall it has this feel of where the bar was lowest to it. It also suffers from the problem of having a character or two too many. Seven Samurai could get away with it. That movie is over three hours long. A Bug's Life is barely over an hour and a half.<br/><br/>Still, I have fond memories of this film and it was still an enjoyable hour and a half even as an adult. Pixar has nothing to be ashamed of, especially given that this was only their second outing."
"michael-3204","5","1","2","2 August 2016"," A step down from ""Toy Story""
","Not a bad movie by any means, but it's hard not to be disappointed by the degree to which Pixar's second feature falls short of the very high standard it set with its first, ""Toy Story."" Visually, ""A Bug's Life"" is almost as impressive and should be applauded for a completely different setting -- writers/directors Lasseter and Stanton certainly can't be accused of simply repeating themselves.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the characterizations here aren't nearly as rich and entertaining and the casting not as inspired. Phyllis Diller could almost make a good substitute for the function Don Rickles served in ""Toy Story,"" but she's not given enough to do and never really gets to cut loose. Kevin Spacey is always a good villain and adds some spice to the proceedings as Hopper, but the notion of making grasshoppers into a biker gang -- which should have worked well -- is half-heartedly executed. The rest of the cast, particularly Dave Foley and Julia Louis-Dreyfus, aren't especially interesting or memorable. After a slow start, the film definitely picks up with the introduction of the circus, performers of which provide most of the comic relief, but the only standout is Heimlich the caterpillar who can't wait to get his wings.<br/><br/>Overall, the story is a bit too convoluted to convey the simple, powerful messages about conformity and perseverance the film wants to deliver as cleanly as it might with a tighter story structure. This is probably a film children will still enjoy, but unlike ""Toy Story,"" there isn't as much here for people who've passed through puberty."

"djansen24","7","1","2","8 September 2011"," Still a very good movie, but one of my least favorite to watch
","Pixar's 2nd feature, Bug's Life, finds them expanding their animation palette, expanding the boundaries of storytelling, and getting a little muddled in the process. This IS a very good movie, one that for the most part delights and enthralls, but something is lacking here. After reflecting on it a moment, I think the main element is forcing things in an unnatural way with not completely fleshed out characters. Pixar films have a way of taking great stories, telling them very effectively, and letting them unfold at a natural pace. And that's the problem (albeit a minor one) with Bug's Life. There are the multitude of jokes, but this time some work and some don't. Some of the characters, especially the circus crew, are not fleshed out well at all. Instead, they seem as superficial as cardboard caricatures who when they react to certain situation, leave us with no insights or surprises. And Flick himself is not the most engaging lead (maybe it was the high pitch of Foley's voice?). Couple that with jokes that aren't quite as funny and you get a movie where a lot of love was poured into the animation (which is fabulous) and good intent was poured into a potentially great story but where I felt something lacking. That being said, it still is Pixar, and it still dazzles! There is one scene at the locust hangout that might be a little too brutal for small kids, but it is for the most part age appropriate for all ages. A good, but not great Pixar film. They would correct this with a succession of absolutely brilliant films which would last from their next all the way through Up! Not bad from a single studio, eh?"

Yet it seems this highly underrated movie inexplicably will always stay in Toy Story's shadow.<br/><br/>The story truly is inspired. I love how it serves as a warning about the McCarthey Era, which seems an an overlooked time in our nation's history as this movie is. Flick represents new ideas, inventions, and forward thinking as well as the working man. The ants represent our society and (again) the working man. When communists come to America to take our spoils, Flick (foward thinking) is sent to retrieve people to help them (our local government).

"idbin2005","8","1","2","4 April 2006"," Nature has a certain order
","Abridged from 2,308 words to fit the IMDb limit of 1,000 words.<br/><br/>Since drawings are inherently genderless, the animation of gender provides unique opportunities for distorting gender stereotypes.<br/><br/>A Bug's Life opens with a portrayal of gender hierarchy. The ants are technically ruled by a queen, but in reality by her daughter, the princess. Hence we see from the outset the intrusion of human gender politics into a world created to amuse, and perhaps educate, human children. Note: real queen ants doesn't rule, they merely breed.<br/><br/>In Disney's bug society the workers are subservient to female ants. That is nature. What is not natural is that in A Bug's Life the worker ants have male voices. Real worker ants are female: male ants only exist to inseminate the queen, and die shortly after mating.<br/><br/>In this imaginary world all the ants of both sexes have enough to live healthy and natural lives. There are only two problems with this microcosm: and males cause both.<br/><br/>Flik is a bumbling male inventor and engineer. Engineering seems to be a negative, destructive, patriarchal force. We see plant stalks damaged by one of his inventions, and the princess - a female - being crushed. This emphasises a stereotypical female victim/male destroyer role.<br/><br/>The male worker ants gather food into a huge pile. They are directed by male ants. The gatherers are clearly of very limited intelligence: when a leaf falls in their path, they need help in order to get around it. The male helpers are slightly more intelligent, but not by much.<br/><br/>The ants hide underground. The princess heroically ensures that her subjects are safe from what is evidently a dangerous situation. But bumbling Flik has been left outside. In an instant he contrives to lose the whole feast. The food pile was very precariously balanced to begin with - by male gatherers and male directors. The disaster is engineered entirely by males.<br/><br/>Note that a real queen ant does not protect her colony, and has a smaller brain than her workers.<br/><br/>The food was a conciliatory offering to a gang of grasshoppers: the matriarchal ant society had found a peaceful solution to a physical threat, but male action threatens that stability. The grasshoppers seem to be all male. They threaten, they swagger; yet they are bumbling and hypocritical. Stereotypical males, in other words.<br/><br/>Cut to a fight between a beetle and a spider. The beetle is very threatening and appears to have all the physical advantages. Somehow, the spider hurts the beetle, which then bursts into tears. The spider consoles it. The beetle's voice is male, the spider's voice is female. Ergo, males can't really fight, despite their advantages; females are stronger and braver than males, regardless of size and strength. This message is repeated in the closing grasshopper scenes: aggression is all front. It is a questionable message. In reality, kids who confront bullies may find they win, or they may get beaten to a pulp: some bullies are tough.<br/><br/>We soon realise that the fight is a performance in an insect circus: but that the snivelling isn't a part of the act. The circus is losing money. Through a quick succession of argumentative, vain, childish male characters, we learn why the circus has problems. The two females - the spider and the butterfly - don't share the blame.<br/><br/>There are a couple of heckling male flies in the audience. Their comments are not only unhelpful, they are also sexist, referring lewdly to the ladybird who they believe to be female. Or perhaps they are joking about this. No females behave in an overtly sexist manner in the film, so sexism is being portrayed as a male trait. The ladybird is male, and doesn't like being mistaken for a female. His reaction is unduly aggressive, i.e. he exaggerates his maleness. This is instantly recognisable as a portrayal of male sexual identity crisis: but anyone who doubts this should note that at the end of the film we are told he is now ""in touch with his feminine side"".<br/><br/>We learn that the beetle's name is Dim, i.e. he is stupid, as well as aggressive, bullying and cowardly. None of the females have such derogatory names. This is not to suggest that every single negative quality is associated with males, and vice-versa. Flik in particular is brave, intelligent and resourceful. However the very few female weaknesses are both relatively trivial and justified, for example the princess's impatience with Flik. All of the male characters, on the other hand, are at best deeply flawed.<br/><br/>The ants win the battle. ""Nature has a certain order"", the princess tells Hopper. Females, it seems, head this film's view of that order. The final scene is in part entirely natural: hopper ends up being fed to some chicks. But it is made very clear that he is still alive, which may not be very realistic. His screams are certainly not realistic: grasshoppers do not have human male voices. Hopper's demise is merely another example of trivialising male death - even hideous death - in the name of entertainment. In this case, entertainment for children.<br/><br/>Most films would have ended with the male and female leads beginning a relationship, but this one is so steeped in 1990s political correctness that it can't allow that to happen - despite the hints earlier in the film, and even with the female in the superior role. The final message, then, is that women do not need men.<br/><br/>A Bug's Life is an entertaining film whose animation is never less than astonishing. The closing credits alone are amazing. Nevertheless it is a consistently sexist portrayal of gender roles."

","At first, when it came out, ""A Bug's Life was my least favorite Pixar film.

I had no idea that Phyllis Diller did the voice of the queen ant. (P.D. makes a guest appearance on Full House in the first season.) I had never heard of Dave Foley, and I wasn't too familiar with Julia Louis-Dreyfus, since I never watch Seinfield. (too much profanity) I did recognize P.T.

I must have missed the comedy before, but last year I listened to just the music at some parts, and it became one of my favorite movies. (Listen to just the music on the DVD) <br/><br/>Kevin Spacey did the voice of Hopper, the leader of the grasshopper gang. He did a great speech at the grasshopper's hideout, and I really liked it when he did that funny scene with Molt at the anthill.

"say_andy","7","1","2","12 April 2005"," Yet another Pixar success
","First off, let's get the technical details out of the way. Like all Pixar films, A Bug's Life looks fantastic. The animation is bold and bright, giving its anthropomorphic bugs the usual 3D rendering process that Pixar first showed the world with its first picture, Toy Story. Also, the film does a fairly convincing job with fire in the film, a tricky element to capture with animation.<br/><br/>The voice actors all do a great job fleshing out their characters, and do so without upstaging their characters. Unlike other recent animated films, where the animators chose to tailor the animated figure to the actor, the actor tailor their performances to the animated figure. Kevin Spacey as the villainous Hopper is a particular standout, along with David Hyde Pierce's comedic performance as Slim.<br/><br/>The story itself is engaging, following the protagonist ant, Flik (Dave Foley), in his attempt to redeem himself in the eyes of the colony by finding other insects to help him ward off the grasshopper gang that torments them. In this attempt, he stumbles across a group of fun and lovable circus bugs (a collection including a male ladybug, a preying mantis, a black widow spider, a gypsy moth, a walking stick-bug, a caterpillar, a dung beetle, and a couple pillbugs), who come back to the colony with him in a misunderstanding. Eventually, everyone teams up to save the day. Flik's journey to ""the city"" where he finds these bugs is the funniest part of the movie, and a perfect example of how an animated film can use sight gags for great comedic effect, without having them dominate the entire narrative structure.<br/><br/>My favourite parts of the movie are when the bugs acted like bugs (mosquitoes flying into bug zappers, ants losing it when separated from the colony, flies having 24 hours to live). These parts are quite clever and contribute to some of the genuine laughs of the film. However, while a fun movie, and a great family movie, this movie doesn't quite capture the high levels of quality of other Pixar works like Finding Nemo or The Incredibles. Of all of Pixar's films, this one is probably the most kid-centric and has the least to offer for adults. Which, is to be expected since it's about bugs. Kids love bugs. Because kids are weird.<br/><br/>Which makes it a perfect film for kids, but merely a pleasant film for the rest of us. I enjoyed it, but didn't love it."
"rellwood","Null","1","2","27 November 2004"," More than a kid's story
","A Bug's Life is more than a kid's story much in the same way as is Antz. It's an allegory of class struggle for certain, but it is focused on the fact that the long-range agenda of global Elite depend on the faithful, mindless labor of the 99.9999999% of the world population which are not among the Elite. There is a school of thought predicated on the model of the beehive which says that all non-elitists are the drones, the worker bees and the Elite-- characterized by their voracious appetites for increasing power and wealth, are the hive keepers. A Bug's Life points out that the model only works when the drones and the ants and the lower classes work without a thought above their own existence. The story drives home the point that if education and thought are added to the colony then individualism and ensuing a revolution of government is the result. The Ants utilize technology (the bird they built), surprise and a united front to take their stand. The Divine, as demonstrated by the living bird's devouring Hopper, blesses their actions. A Bug's Life may indeed be for children; The Lost Children of Democracy; the oppressed orphans of God; the hypnotized colony child-like drones without whom the Elite could not survive. This movie is a subtle wake up call to a sleeping Baby Huey."

"emm","8","1","2","22 April 1999"," Disney's visual feast scratches the surface!
","Let's remember this analogy for a moment and see if this makes sense: TOY STORY (1995) is to three-dimensional polygons as SNOW WHITE (1937) is to two-dimensional hand-drawn art. We have here two little movies that set all-new standards in cartoon animation. Now, I'm finally glad that Disney and Pixar waited three years by not leaking out their secrets kept behind locked doors, and A BUG'S LIFE is ultimately worth the impatience. This is the best looking 3-D showcase I've seen so far, even surpassing ANTZ, and has applied the same technical formula that TOY STORY gave to us. Of course, there are going to be more and better 3-D movies coming our way, but we're already tasting the future right now.<br/><br/>It will be interesting to point out the comparisons between A BUG'S LIFE and ANTZ, both that has tiny little ants that appear large when seen off a projection television. ANTZ was a tried-and-true effort by newcomer Dream Works SKG; it just wasn't satisfying enough to hold its appeal to everyone, not even the children. It was also a little too slow in its animation, and was keen enough to make a Hollywoodian image for itself. Or even ""Woodian"", as in Woody Allen. It needed a lot more bite than it could chew, but that's ANTZ.<br/><br/>Here, in A BUG'S LIFE, ""family"" entertainment is a whole definition not just for its intelligent sense of humor, but in the way Pixar established a whole new environment for animators to take better advantage of handling three-dimensional objects and landscapes. You want a lifelike cartoon to become a surrealistic universe that's far beyond our imagination. Shaggy and Scooby-Doo would be wandering around reflections of the sun and getting lost in the dark shadows. It's amazing how fast and slick this movie goes on its motions of ants running and birds flying even with colors that appear and shine as a glossy liquid. Whatever more there is to the tantalizing visual quality, it's something we all are going to look forward to the next few years, and it could threaten to dethrone the traditional cartoon as we know it. Tempting but frightening words, aren't they?<br/><br/>The visuals aren't the only best things about it, but you can't knock down Disney for its timeless heritage of magical fun-filled wizardry. Let's face it, the movie looks so good enough to burst a chuckle or two. Or, if you handle it, say 99! Just as appealing to grown-ups as it is to children, the comedy relief bodes extremely well for an animated movie running on ultra-high speed microchips. It makes a new statement for the term ""ladybug"", which is sure to fool many! This is the finest example of creativity and delightfulness in a ""family"" picture sitting next to the original BABE. Sure, we can handle the modernization of its jokes any time!<br/><br/>There is just one quibble though: the celebrities give this the all-too familiar voice of Hollywood. I wish there were more talented voice acts to liven up this brilliant looking movie a la creme rather than hiring overpaid TV stars and film actors. Oh well, at least they contributed to the characters with all their diligence.<br/><br/>For those sitting in the front row near the boxing ring watching the fight and have kept track of the action, you'll see why A BUG'S LIFE wins over ANTZ by a stunning knockout in the first round, and so does Disney. I hate to question about Dream Works' further potential, but the studio sure has a long, long way to go before managing itself as a triumphant pioneer in ""family"" entertainment. It may not become the next ""Disney"" than we'd least anticipate.<br/><br/>And for a while, you'd believe I'd give this one the undisputed title as ""The Greatest Motion Picture Ever Made""! Not exactly! But what a fine ""family"" movie this is! (Are you at all convinced that a bold summary like that would be the perfect fashion statement for presenting user comments? Like in TITANIC?)"

","The best children's stories in the literature have souls.  By this, we mean they have significance and nourish the growing mind with inspiration, motivation, or teach something.  The stories need not be seminal but should at least bring some value to the reader or audience. This is the case, for example, in Pinocchio, where a puppet loved life so much it wanted to be a real boy and by its goodness became one. In A Bug's Life, we find nothing even approximating a meaningful story.  It is tragic because the producing studio, Pixar, has developed the finest graphic animation in the world today in character renderings.<br/><br/>That the studio limits itself to children's audiences is their choice and certainly, although more limited than a crossover or a family market the child market still yields enough box office to keep the doors open. Why they have chosen to produce superficial stories, however, so flat and wafer thin they will not have legs for the future, is a mystery.<br/><br/>We hope that at some point this remarkably talented group of animators will somehow mature into a shop with a strong story group that can manage to locate a good source of literature to mount with their beautiful artistry.  Indeed, no American animation producer has had strong story resources or even analytical recognition since the death of Walt Disney in 1966."

","Pixar were really still finding there feet with A Bug's Life. There's nothing really wrong with it. It is just a little dull.<br/><br/>A Bug's Life centres on the life of a bug. Funny that. Name of Flick. Flick's ant colony gets attacked by grasshoppers, seemingly frequently. They exploit them for food. When the ants try to stand up for themselves, they get intimidated and the grasshoppers demand their entire food supply.<br/><br/>However, the grasshoppers don't really feel like a threat. I kept thinking that with the number of ants in the colony, they could easily defeat the band of 20 grasshoppers. And at one point in the movie the grasshoppers literally spell it out, but for some reason it goes nowhere.<br/><br/>The circus characters are supposed to be quirky and funny. I personally don't find ""look at how stupid I am"" humour to be funny and the circus is filled with this. It felt like irony to me. Really the only character who is funny is the ladybird. The delivery of his lines and his comic timing is almost perfect. However, it saddens me that it wasn't achieved by the other characters. They became reduced to a few character traits and little depth of personality.<br/><br/>And finally, the plot has two clichÃ©s that I really cannot abide in a film. Firstly, the plot hinges on the character overhearing the master plan of the grasshoppers, who just happen to be talking about it out loud, in detail, for no reason. It just didn't make sense. And secondly, the bugs aren't really responsible for their own victory. The bird just happened to be there and just happened to need to feed its baby birds that just conveniently hatched very recently. It didn't feel calculated or planned, which frustrated me.<br/><br/>Overall, I think A Bug's Life is OK. I would be mad about having to watch it again. I mainly think Pixar was still finding its feet and it shows in A Bug's Life."

","A Bug's Life is a cute film that can be enjoyed by both adults and children. Like most family films, it has a colourful array of characters and the typical cruel but incompetent (and often amusing) villains. Not only are the characters lovable and the story fun, but A Bug's Life is also a learning experience and a story about morals and teamwork. It is a good film in which to escape into the tiny world of insects.<br/><br/>A Bug's Life can be enjoyed by the family, and it is certainly more enjoyable than Antz, which was released around the same time. The only problem with A Bug's Life is the pacing of the story. In some scenes, too much happens and leads to confusion. Other scenes are slow and drawn out. It's not the best animation out there, but it's still a good film and worth watching on a rainy day."

","This film depicts ants locked in a mortal struggle with their oppressors, the grasshoppers.<br/><br/>The animation was superb, and probably the strongest part of the film. How often can you say that every frame in a movie is spectacular?<br/><br/>The acting was adequate. However, in many of the roles, it seemed as though better actors may have been available. Though I think Dave Foley and Julia Louis-Dreyfus are great actors, almost anyone could have been cast in their roles and done a solid job. Some performances were brilliant, such as Phyllis Diller as the queen and David Hyde Pierce as Slim, but for the most part, the acting was forgettable.<br/><br/>As for the plot, it was mostly predictable. There were a couple of interesting twists, such as the construction of a fake bird, but the story was extremely formulaic.<br/><br/>Still, the movie was worth seeing.

","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All Costs<br/><br/>I'm going to have to add a hint of laziness to my review here.This is the starting point of another review when I have to say that before you even begin to watch A Bug's Life,you know it has a lot of competition to stand up to.Firstly,there's Antz,the other insect related feature that was released nationwide at cinemas not 2 months before it.Secondly,there's Disney/Pixar's other 'same-style-of-animation'movie Toy Story ,which drew in hefty review's about a couple of years back.<br/><br/>Somehow,the Disney bug movie manages to fall short on both these other animation features.Maybe my frame of mind would be different if I was a 2 year old movie critic,but you don't get many of them.However,I do think A Bug's Life could have made it easier on itself:what's the one key thing that both Antz and Toy Story,both intended as children's films in the first place,have in common?:kid's under the above age,according to the standards set by Hollywood movie clerks,don't like a movie of their's to run much over 80 minutes,or so.With Antz running in at 79 minutes,and Toy Story coming in at 77,ABL has to run on for an astounding 93 minutes!And,yes,the story get's very,very ponderous.About 30 minutes into the movie,I gave up thinking there might be an intelligent,intricate plot line to follow ,because I'm sure this was intended as a simple,undemanding kid's film (I borrowed it off my 3 year old cousin!),until I came to the obvious realisation that people of about that age are'nt going to notice lazy plot gaps,and are most likely just going to be entertained by all the dazzling lights,and characters.This is one of the movie's good points:the characters,and,of course,their appearance on screen.The swarthy stick insect,the German slug,and the meditating green horn are fun character's.<br/><br/>I think it's highly unlikely the producer's ripped off the Antz idea of observational ,social humour ,since both the films were produced at pretty much the same time,unless ,of course,they had an insider working for them in the conference room of the other film.But,it would'nt have worked anyway,because,frankly,a large chunk of it simply dos'nt work here.The 2 main character's,Flick and Hopper,emerge as one-dimensional,stereotype ideas from other films before it,and the only redeeming feature in this area of the film is,as ever,the hilarious outtakes.<br/><br/>A Bug's Life holds the attention,but it could probably do so much more if you were'nt so old.****"

","This is one of the worst films for kids I have ever seen with my four year old son. It is built around fear, bullies, aggression, and ugly stereotypes. This film is a bonanza for therapists and sociologists, and it goes a long way towards explaining some of the pathologies of this society. How about a movie that lets kids be kids, instead of this onslaught of cheap sentiments and terror? The calculated story uses every trick to scare kids. The limited imagination of the story writers is particularly insulting. Is everything just about good and evil and the fight for survival? For young kids?? In many ways the film is a throwback to Cold War films such as Red Dawn (1984), in which school kids fought a Russian invasion (no kidding!).

","I thought that Antz was really good because of the number of good actors, but this rival film from Walt Disney Pictures and Pixar did better business. Basically ants pick food for greedy grasshoppers, and disaster happens when Flik (Dave Foley) is responsible for ruining the offering. The grasshopper leader, Hopper (Kevin Spacey) with his gang give them till the end of summer to try and gather food again. Flik decides to leave the island, with Princess Atta's (Julia Louis-Dreyfuss) permission, to find warrior bugs to fight the grasshoppers, and to his disbelief, what he brings back is a bunch of circus clowns. These are Slim (David Hyde Pierce) the stick insect, Heimlich (Joe Ranft) the fat German caterpillar, Francis (Small Soldiers' Denis Leary) the ladybird, Manny (Jonathan Harris) the magician bug with assistant Gypsy Moth (Madeline Kahn) and Rosie (Jumanji's Bonnie Hunt) the black widow spider. Anyway, they end up proving themselves when they build a bird, and after this fails they do succeed in scaring off the other grasshoppers, and Hopper gets what's coming to him. Also starring Tom and Jerry: The Movie's Richard Kind as Molt, Toy Story's John Ratzenberger as P.T. Flea and Fright Night's Roddy McDowall as Mr. Soil, his last film role before his death of lung cancer.

There is only one negative thing I can say, the ""extras"" on the DVD are very spartan, which is a shame. Because there is a very rich ""making of"" documentary just yelling to be included.<br/><br/>The animation is truly incredible. The colors are very rich and varied, depending on whether it is a scene in sunlight, at dusk, in the insect ""lounge"", inside the anthill, or during a rainstorm. During ""quiet"" scenes, the background grass and twigs move almost imperceptably in the breeze, just like they would in real life.<br/><br/>The story is simple but unique - bully grasshoppers, led by ""Hopper"" (Kevin Spacey), expect the ants to harvest food for them each year. But this year, ""Flick"" messes up, and then volunteers to go ""outside the colony"" to find ferocious insects that will agree to protect the ants. Ultimately they realize their greatest strength is in numbers.<br/><br/>Even with the best animation ever, the simple story would not hold your interest long were it not for the witty dialog. ""See this rock, pretend it is a seed..."" or ""Don't panic, we are professionals, we'll just go around the leaf"" or ""(Flick to Hopper) Yep, that's just another fake bird.""

All they do is hoard their food (oil) and refuse to give it all to the grasshoppers. The grasshoppers just want to earn an honest living. How can they do that without the stuff the ants are gathering? It really isn't fair. So what to the grasshoppers do? Take what's rightfully theirs by force. Why can't the ants see that it's the right thing to do?<br/><br/>So instead of doing the right thing a renegade ant named Flik (clearly Osama Bin Laden) assembles an army of mercenaries (Al Qaeda) to ""protect their homeland"". This group of terrorists for some reason can't appreciate anything the grasshoppers have done for them so they try to slaughter every last one. And for what?

","I'm sorry, but I legitimately deplore this movie. While I will give the animation for being colorful and exploring the world of insects and creepy-crawlies sufficiently, I found that in comparison to Toy Story it hasn't aged well. The characters provided little entrancement to motivate myself to continue to watch the movie (especially with some of their voices), so I had to dig somewhere deep psychologically to ensure that I wouldn't switch channels. The main issue that I have with this movie, however (which may involve both the animation and characters), is that I found it to reek worse than a stink bug of monotony. I laughed at none of the jokes and even though the writers and the voice actors most definitely put valiant (Oh God, not that movie) labor into making A Bug's Life, it just didn't pay off for me. Before the cash-grabs corrupted Disney in some ways, many Pixar fans considered this to be the company's worst film. I can agree with them that this is one to generally skip, but I do appreciate that they TRIED. It is better to try and fail than to never try at all, as my PE teacher for 8 years told us."

","Pixar has had massive success over the years with the full-length CGI animated movies they have made. ""A Bug's Life"" was the second of a whole bunch of features they have made so far, preceded by the company's feature-length debut, the groundbreaking ""Toy Story"", which was the first ever feature-length CGI movie. I remember when this follow-up was heavily advertised around the time of its release in the late 1990's, but I never actually saw it until November 2006. I watched it twice that month, and over three years later, I have seen it a third time. It has never impressed me as much as probably any other Pixar film I've ever seen, but after three viewings, I still think it's better than some of the films I've seen from DreamWorks Animation.<br/><br/>Ant Island is the home of a colony of ants. These ants are forced to gather food for a gang of grasshoppers who come and take it every year. One member of this colony is Flik, an inventor with a bad reputation for causing trouble with his inventions, even though he doesn't mean to. One year, when the colony has just finished preparing the annual offering, Flik accidentally knocks it into a stream just before the grasshoppers arrive to get it! The grasshopper leader, Hopper, decides to give them a second chance to gather food and have it ready by the end of the season, but they will have to double their offering! Flik suggests to the colony's royal council that he goes and finds ""warrior bugs"" to fight off the grasshoppers when they come back. Princess Atta, the future Queen, lets him go on this mission just so he won't be around to cause trouble while the colony tries to gather food for another offering. The inventor finds a group of bugs which he thinks are warriors, but after he takes them back to Ant Island and introduces them, he learns that they are actually not warriors, but circus bugs!<br/><br/>The main reason why this second Pixar feature has never absolutely astounded me might be the characters. To me, none of them have ever really stood out as much as they could have, and generally seem a bit bland. Fortunately, however, it's not like ""Shark Tale"", a film with a very idiotic and unlikable lead character. ""A Bug's Life"" does have a likable enough main character, one which viewers can root for. The story also seems somewhat bland at times, but for the most part, it's good enough to keep the film at least moderately entertaining, and sometimes has some good suspense, especially later on. The humour, like certain other aspects of the film, isn't as good as it could have been, but there are definitely funny moments, some of them involving Francis, a male ladybug who is sometimes mistaken for a female. You can always expect great animation from Pixar, and the animation in this particular effort of theirs is no exception. With all this movie has to offer, it may be slightly disappointing when it comes to Pixar standards, but it is reasonable family entertainment."

The story is where things really need to come into play. Well This story follows an ant that isn't quite getting along with the other antz in that conformist thing that they like to do. (Also seen in the plot from the movie Antz which now that I think about it is kind of creepy with both films coming out so close together) Anycase our hero ant has to save the colony that treats him like trash against evil bully insects that are out to extort them for food. This adventure brings up a cast of colorful and friendly characters that have many comic moments throughout the film.<br/><br/>Overall the story is about working together to accomplish something that couldn't have been accomplished alone. Good lesson overall but still not extremely high class.<br/><br/>In the end if you strip away the technological glitter A Bug's life is a charming little family movie with a plot that is entertaining but nothing highly innovative. Still worth a watch and if you are a fan of Pixar like I am you won't be ashamed of having it in your collection though I feel it is the weakest of the Pixar titles.<br/><br/>Best wishes hope you enjoy the film."
"DavidSim240183","5","0","4","8 January 2008"," One of Pixar's less successful films
","In 1998, an unusual coincidence occurred. The type that can only happen in Hollywood. Two computer animated films were released simultaneously about the world of ants. First off was DreamWorks Antz, an extremely entertaining journey into the social hierarchy of an ant colony. And A Bug's Life from those geniuses at Pixar.<br/><br/>Any Pixar film is worth a watch because they're a delight in just about every respect. Flawless animation. Involving plots. Well defined characters. But most importantly, that shrewd level of intelligence that constantly keeps Pixar head and shoulders above other animated fare.<br/><br/>But A Bug's Life is that rare thing. A Pixar disappointment. Its not a bad film. Pixar have never made an outright terrible film. Even the indifferent response to Cars seemed unwarranted to me.<br/><br/>But A Bug's Life is a Pixar film that left me cold. Perhaps if I hadn't seen Antz first I might have liked it more, but somehow I doubt it. Because Antz is the type of film A Bug's Life wants to be but isn't. Its the one time where DreamWorks got one over on Pixar, instead of nipping at their coattails.<br/><br/>Antz was a film conducted with a mind-boggling sense of detail. It convinced you there was a whole micro-sized world there beneath our feet. The failing of A Bug's Life is its story is so thin. It doesn't have the ambitious scope of most Pixar films, and its characters are some of the studio's most forgettable.<br/><br/>ABL, it has to be said, falls into some very predictable storytelling. You can almost see the clichÃ©s being wheeled into place. The underdog hero. The comic sidekicks. The dastardly villain. There are none of the usual songs that Disney love so much, but ABL might have benefited from some.<br/><br/>The comparisons to Antz are sadly unavoidable. Since it gets right what ABL gets so wrong, they make interesting bedfellows. Although I'm not much of a fan of Woody Allen, he was perfectly cast as the hero of Antz. A put upon ant suffering from peer pressure and his own neurosis. The hero of ABL feels like a lesser developed version of the same character.<br/><br/>Flik, along with all the ants in his colony gather food for a gang of bullying grasshoppers every season. When Flik's bumbling puts a spanner in the works, Hopper (voiced by Kevin Spacey) the leader of the grasshoppers, demands an increase in their yearly supply.<br/><br/>Flik refuses to stand by and watch his people work they're way into starvation, so he goes off to find help, and brings back a bumbling circus troupe of insects. But it doesn't take long for Flik to learn the truth about his would be saviours. Or for them to learn the real reason they've been brought to the colony. <br/><br/>Even the most committed Pixar fan will probably be disappointed with A Bug's Life. A lot of people say Cars was the first fall from grace for the mighty Pixar. This isn't true. ABL was the first dip in quality for this great studio. Fortunately a rarity for Pixar.<br/><br/>ABL is a film that cruises in neutral for far too long. Visually its a treat. Just like any Pixar film. But I preferred Antz' gritty, down and dirty aesthetic. They looked like real ants. The ones here are much too colourful and cuddly. They're much too user-friendly.<br/><br/>The best type of Pixar film is one that opens itself up to a world of possibilities. Finding Nemo presented us with a breathtaking ocean world. The superb Toy Story 2 (also underrated in my opinion) brought Woody and Buzz Lightyear out of the confines of a kids bedroom and into the big wide world where they had one hell of a rollicking adventure!<br/><br/>Because ABL stays in one place for so long the film suffers as a result. Perhaps if it had some engaging characters to focus on, it might have compensated. But nobody here registered with me that much. In fact as I write this, I can't even remember half of they're names. <br/><br/>Flik is pretty disposable as a hero. So is the Ant Queen and Princess. And the circus troupe, though voiced by true talent like David Hyde Pierce and Denis Leary, is never allowed to cut loose.<br/><br/>The only actor who gets into the show with any lasting impression is Kevin Spacey. He makes Hopper wonderfully loathsome. The type of villain you really love to hate. And his comeuppance is very satisfying (if a bit grisly by Disney's standards).<br/><br/>What's missing from A Bug's Life is the smoothness Pixar films usually flow with. There's not a solid enough hook to hang the story from, like there was with Buzz Lightyear finding out he was only a toy. Or little Nemo getting lost in the vast depths of the ocean. A few nice ideas here and there (like a scarily realistic moving bird and some genuinely funny outtakes over the end credits) but A Bug's Life is by far Pixar's most disappointing film."

","This is another in a long line of Hollywood efforts where the gimmick is everything and the substance is sadly lacking. A schmaltzy cartoon, it is too frequently annoying and occasionally aggravating, yet there are moments where it rises to near-perfection. We can do without the ants, for there is nothing special about them, reflecting Hollywood's view of people as mindless, fear-driven conformists. The lead character is supposed to be imaginative and different, but he's written as a screw-up whose silly, mind-numbing antics are just plain foolish. Only a kid wouldn't be bored by him, while in contrast, it takes an intelligent, focused adult to truly appreciate the subtlety of the grasshoppers. The animation, personalities, and dialog are so effective and convincing that it is nothing less than phenomenal. Too bad so much of the script is contrived, predictable, and unoriginal, taking the wonderful parts down with it into a chasm of mediocrity. Those responsible for spoiling what otherwise might have been a first-rate animated classic ought to be horsewhipped."

But to be honest, I was a little nervous, because I remember seeing the trailer when I was younger and it looked like a typical kid's Disney/Pixar flick, but I was pleasantly satisfied and had so much fun watching A Bug's Life, it's a true treasure for the whole family.<br/><br/>Flic is an ant who keeps screwing things up for his colony, his colony also collects food for the grasshoppers who threaten to beat up their colony if they don't. Flic feels like if he goes out and gets some warriors to help the colony gather food, maybe things will go by faster, but he ends up meeting a flea circus of different bugs. He tells them that they are going to a place where they could perform and being appreciated for it and he lies to the colony that they are true warriors, but everything untangles in Flic's lies and the grasshoppers are getting very impatient.<br/><br/>A Bug's Life is a great story and excellent animation, I just loved the humor that was used because it was great for kids and adults.

","Pixar's computer animation is of course top of the line here and in every movie they made to this date. However, the story this time is a little too bland this time to really involve an adult viewer, whereas kids below the age of 10 will probably eat it up. Flik, as voiced by Dave Foley, is just too darn nice and to make him an outcast because he is the most accident-prone ant in the colony will probably strike a chord with a lot of us but it doesn't really make the character funny. All of Pixar's character's from Woody to Mr. Incredible have many quirks but both Flik and the ant princess Atta (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) are too ""normal"".<br/><br/>Things pick up a little after Flik goes on his journey outside the colony where he meets the circus bugs but the circus setting in a bugs world has been done so many times that you almost wish that they had chosen a different setting (the factory like in Monster's Inc. could have worked). The misfit bugs are of course comedic distractions from the very real threat that hangs over the Ant colony, that of the abusive grasshoppers who intend to do terrible deeds if they are not given their ill-gotten food. By the way, the leader, Hopper, is the most terrifying creature in a Disney film yet and his ultimate fate (minor spoiler) will probably frighten some kids. The voice of Kevin Spacey was a real surprise because he expresses more emotion here than he usually does in his live-action roles. The less said about Richard Kind the better.<br/><br/>When you compare this to the other Ant movie that year, I will say that this is superior in the animation department but as many Disney ventures it is too darn cute this time. Check out the baby bug who believes in Flik like nobody else does and of the circus bugs only the ladybug, voiced by Denis Leary and the Stick by David Pierce are truly original characters.<br/><br/>So a good time if you have kids but to teens and singles there are not much to offer, except seeing spectacular animation."

And even now, I find a few moments in the movie amusing.<br/><br/>HOWEVER: The biggest problem with this movie was that it was far, far, FAAR too predictable! I can give you some examples. Right from the get-go, you can predict Princess Ata will become Queen at the end. As soon as you see Princess Dot trying and failing to fly, you know she will be able to do so by the end. When you see everybody hating Flik and his inventions, you know that by the end everyone will love them both. The second you discover Hopper's fear of birds, you know that that is how he will meet his demise. You can also tell that Heimlich will become a butterfly before all is over.<br/><br/>I honestly cannot believe how this movie beat ""Antz"" in popularity, when the latter film was an altogether funnier, cleverer, and more entertaining film with a more engaging storyline and characters. I give this movie 5/10, because I don't want to be too harsh on it when it has several redeeming features. But I do not think that it was nearly as good as Antz, and certainly too predictable."

","'A Bug's Life' lacks the mordancy that made the humour of 'Toy Story' so appealing to adults; but there's still much to enjoy in this animated film. The cutesy heroes are pretty bland, but the evil grasshoppers are wonderfully brought to life, the asynchronous movement of their multiple limbs a joy to behold.  The real thing that's lacking here, certainly compared to 'Wallace and Grommit' (but 'Toy Story' also), is a sense of pacing: as if the film-makers lack the courage to let you simply marvel at their vivid creations, the film is action-packed but fairly monotonous in mood; and again unlike 'Toy Story', the viewer's perception of the characters is not shifted during the course of the film.  These may sound like very 'adult' considerations; but the best animations can appeal to the child in us all.  'A Bug's Life' is superficial even for a children's tale; but fun nonetheless."

","There are so many different stories that could be written about the world of bugs and this is an enjoyable one but I hope the creators of this film don't give up on making animated features about insects. The stories that could be used are endless! This story is about an ant colony that has to harvest food for the marauding grasshoppers that fly in every season. One of the ants is Flik (Dave Foley) who has big ideas but is accident prone and when the grasshoppers are about to fly in Flik makes a blunder that destroys the food that was picked for them. The grasshoppers are headed by Hopper (Kevin Spacey) and he threatens the ant colony by telling them that when they return next time there had better be double the amount of food. The colony's Queen (Phyllis Diller) and her daughter Princess Atta (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) are furious with Flik but he tells them about his plan to combat the grasshoppers. His idea is to leave the colony and venture out to find warrior bugs that he will bring back to fight off Hopper and the rest. They agree so Flik walks off to another area where bugs congregate and eventually he comes across a group of insects that want to help. The insects are ex-circus performers and are unaware that Flik wants them to fight grasshoppers. They think that they are brought in to perform for the colony.<br/><br/>
This film was directed by John Lasseter and Andrew Stanton who both created ""Toy Story"" and together they are helping to keep Disney's legend alive and prosperous. They have a good memory for the Disney classics of old and there are many observances (Both clear and obscure) of those films. The computer animation at Pixar seems to be getting better and better and a clear sense of this is the incredibly detailed scenes during the rainstorm. These scenes are a marvel to look at and its hard to figure how they could make these images so rich with intimate details. The story is rather amusing and I was reminded of ""The Three Amigos"" and ""High Plains Drifter"" as I watched this. This film came out the same year as ""Antz"" and I guess the comparisons are inevitable but I think that film has a more adult tone to its story. This film is more in line with its targeted audience of much younger viewers but I did enjoy both films for different reasons. Roddy McDowall is the voice of Mr. Soil and this turned out to be the last film that he ever worked on. This is another very entertaining animated film from the great Pixar Studios and probably the main reason for their success is that even though these stories are aimed at a young crowd both adults and children can enjoy them. They're is enough entertainment for any age group."

","""Toy Story"" was rooted in the fundamentals of childhood memories. All of us as children just KNEW our toys were alive. That they could talk. In turn, we played with them as if they were real. But soon it hit us that they were just pieces of plastic with limbs, and tossed them out. That's what ""Toy Story"" did--it reinvented not only animation, but imagination; it was not only a children's film, but an adult's film, as well. It brought back fond memories of all of our childhood fantasies.<br/><br/>But what ""A Bug's Life"" does is simply toss together a few characters and have them bounce jokes off each other. This film, by itself, is excellent, but when compared to something smart, intelligent and witty, such as, say, Pixar's ""Toy Story,"" it looks like pure commercialism; Pixar's only downfall.<br/><br/>A small ant named Flick (voiced by Dave Foley) is a real mess; a klutz, so to speak. He and his colony of ants, presided over by a new Queen Ant, are harvesting food for the naughty Evil Grasshoppers who come every year to gather food from the ant's hard work. But because of Flick the harvest is lost, and when the grasshoppers show up they are mad. Hopper, the lead grasshopper (Kevin Spacey) is pretty ""flicked"" off, and demands more hard work and labor. Everyone is mad at Flick...until he hires circus talents to fight off the grasshoppers, and tells the ants they are fierce warriors. Restoring their confidence to fight, the ants set up a series of attacks for when the grasshoppers arrive, until they find out the truth behind Flick's lie(s).<br/><br/>""A Bug's Life,"" like ""Toy Story"" and ""Monsters, Inc.,"" is a fairly simple idea. But, unlike the other Pixar films, it is missing a vital element: identification with the audience. In ""Toy Story"" we identified with the story; we were all kids once and had toys. The story just worked because it played with that.<br/><br/>In ""Monsters, Inc.,"" the idea of monsters was played upon. All children at one time or another were scared of monsters under the bed, and by presenting us the monster's side of the story, ""Monsters, Inc.,"" could be enjoyed by both children and adults.<br/><br/>And then there's ""A Bug's Life."" No identification here. How many of us have been bugs before? Exactly. Maybe on a more emotional level we can identify with Flick the Ant, but on a visible basis, we simply cannot. There really is no fun in the storyline. <br/><br/>The story/film is above-average in terms of regular animated motion pictures, but in terms of Pixar films, it is simply a film best to be forgotten in Pixar's otherwise strong resume. Let's all hope that ""Finding Nemo,"" Pixar's upcoming summer film, is better than the ads lead to believe, because if I have it correct, I predict another ""A Bug's Life"" for Pixar next year.<br/><br/>3.5/5 stars -"

","Everything that was great about Toy Story, Pixar's first feature (and the first-ever all-computer animated movie), is even greater in A Bug's Life. Visually, this movie is leaps and bounds ahead of its predecessor. Its environments are far more ambitious than Toy Story's, and they deliver with far more nuance and texture. There are more characters in this movie, and they're a little better played. And the story is cute-- it deals with Flik, an outcast ant (Dave Foley) who is sent away by the colony's princess (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) to find some ""tough bugs"" to fight off the oppressive grasshoppers, led by Hopper (Kevin Spacey), who steal the ants' food. Flik finds a bunch of circus-performer bugs, and mistakes them for fighters, and takes them back to the colony to save the bugs from the grasshoppers. Humor follows. Humor for the whole family. This film has great moments, like when the ants can't figure out how to get around a leaf that has fallen in front of them(although I didn't quite get that, since I would think the ants could see over the leaf, but I guess I was putting too much thought into it.) As many great visual moments as the film has, I just couldn't help feel that it's trapped by the Disney formula of one unlikely hero rising above ""it all"" to save the day. Again, the animation is wonderful and, to be honest, although it's more safe feeling than ""Antz"", ""A Bug's Life"" does do a better job at providing the scope of this miniature world, from the leaves and grass to the stones and ant tunnels.  I did like the fact that the film is in the wide 2.35:1 ratio, making the wide spaces of the grassy colony and the insect city more fascinating to watch.  High marks once again. The Dolby 5.1 soundtrack never misses a beat. All of the dialogue comes from the position of its speaker on screen. Sometimes stereo effects are very hot or cold-- they're either all the way right, all the way left, or straight center. Not the case here. If a character so much as turns his or her head while speaking, it's reflected in the sound field. Excellent.  And the score by Randy Newman sounds great and never overpowers the dialogue or sound.

"Spleen","7","0","3","1 January 2000"," ""An epic of miniature proportions"" ... that's the problem
","So far as appearances are concerned, ""A Bug's Life"" is superb.  The art direction stylises the world of rural insects subtly but surely; and, although I can't help thinking it was a mistake to include any evidence of HUMAN civilisation, that was beautifully done, too. And I applaud the courageous decision to avoid pointless sophistication when designing the insects themselves: they have exactly the robotic design one would expect of creatures with exoskeletons, they move with a minimum of squash and stretch, yet they are not at all lacking in humanity.  Any aspect of the visuals I have forgotten to mention probably deserves praise, too. (With the possible exception of the ladybug design.)<br/><br/>That aside, this is a ninety-six minute film that wants to be three hours in length. Compression has wrenched it out of shape.  It's a mess; and the computer-generated equivalent of fine camera-work and competent performances can't save it.  With a film that tries to do so many contradictory things with its allotted time it's difficult to know where to begin.<br/><br/>Take Flik, the social misfit who makes good. Many of the crimes for which the colony rejects him are, in fact, serious ones: he DOES lie to them, he DOES wreak real havoc, he IS dangerous. This shouldn't stop him from being a sympathetic hero, of course. But it ought to give us pause. If his failings are real, which they are, and integral to the plot, which they are, they ought to have more than a few seconds of screen time devoted to them. Ideally, they ought to be resolved.<br/><br/>Or take the civilisation-versus-barbarians theme, which the film's climax retrospectively underlines, but which is hardly even mentioned beforehand. Or take the relationship between Flik and the princess, which is never defined, which changes from scene to scene, but which, we are led to believe, is a central part of the story. What IS the story, anyway? It's hard to see for all the sub-plots. Or for all the characters. I don't object to crowding the world with so many characters and then paying attention to each of them in turn, but it takes a lot more than 96 minutes to do this kind of thing properly.<br/><br/>Despite trying to do too many things at once and doing none of them well, ""A Bug's Life"" has some thrilling moments.  It's because of them that I'm reluctant to dismiss the film as a turkey -- well, let's be fair, a chicken -- in peacock's feathers. It's not that the film is positively BAD: it's just that it fails (visuals aside) to be positively good, as it's so obviously trying to be.<br/><br/>One last note: I know people liked the ""bloopers"" at the end, but having seen ""Toy Story 2"", I think they were a mistake.  The gag suited the Toy Story world better. Toys are MEANT to be part of games of make-believe: they are ""acting"" almost all the time, so treating them as actors in the end credits doesn't jar. It sure jars in ""A Bug's Life"", though."

","Of course, comparison between this film and the superior (my opinion) Antz is inevitable, but I think other than the fact that they're computer animated and have to do with ants, they have very little in common. They're completely different stories, if Antz is Metropolis, this film is The Seven Samurai (or The Magnificent Seven if you prefer).  Not to say this film is a Seven Samurai remake, other than the concept of a besiged village hiring warriors, it really doesn't have anything in common with Kurosawa's film.<br/><br/>I really did like the fact that Antz was PG, and had an ""edge"" to it, I'm really glad that people are starting to see that animation need not be just for kids, in Europe and Japan, this is not a new idea.  A Bug's Life is much more of a kid's film by comparison, but that didn't keep me from liking it. I do have some complaints though, I didn't find Flik (voiced by Dave Foley) to be a very strong lead character, I thought Woody Allen's Z was a much better lead.  Another thing I didn't like was the character designs, much too ""cute"".  Why are the ants blue?  I have never seen a blue ant, or a four-legged one (actually, these are more two-armed, two-legged).  The world of Antz had a real sense of danger to it, that I think was only hinted at in this film.<br/><br/>Technically, the film is flawless, I think the quality of the animation is one area where Antz and this film may tie.  The animation in this film is very good, some of the characters almost look more like very smooth claymation than CGI.  I think computer animation really does it's job when you don't think about it coming from a computer, and I had moments of that feeling watching this film.  As to be expected from a digital-to-digital transfer, the DVD looks beautiful.  The two sets of ""outtakes"" during the end credits are pretty clever, if you watch the film for the first time on DVD, watch the movie before you watch they outtakes, they're funnier that way.  The short ""Geri's Game"" that precedes the film is a real gem, too (I enjoyed Geri's cameo appearance in Toy Story II).<br/><br/>This film is definately worth seeing if you're a fan of computer animation, but don't expect Antz, I really wish the two films had been released further apart.  Also, if you like insect movies, also check out the French documentary Microcosmos."
"Big S-2","10","0","1","30 November 1999"," A film for children aged 4 to 84
","This is one of those real rarities - a true family film which REALLY CAN be enjoyed by the whole family. It has enough cute, funny characters and an easy-to-follow, eventful plot to keep the kids amused, while at the same time it also boasts a level of sophistication and subtle, adult humour to appeal to the grown-ups as well. The colourful animation and lots of subtle, clever details make this film a joy to watch again and again. My wife and I (we're both into our 30s) were knocked out by this movie and - like a couple of schoolkids - we can't wait for the inevitable ""Bug's Life 2"" which hopefully won't be too long in coming."

","I'm sorry I missed this in the theaters. But I finally rented the video last night and was very glad I did. It's been a long time since any movie has managed to get through a lifetime of emotional armor and get me to laugh out loud so often.<br/><br/>And not just laughs. It's a truly hopeful and optimistic view of an individual's struggle to belong, to give and accept love. I hate the word heartwarming because it gets so overused. But that is exactly the effect it had on me!"
"zack2085","Null","0","1","12 August 1999"," A great movie for everyone!
","""A Bugs Life"" is a great movie, and people of all ages with like it! first there's the computer animation which is spectacular, and then there's the plot with so much heart and characters who are truly funny! (Like Flick, Princess Atta and Heimlich!).<br/><br/>And make sure you watch the HILARIOUS outtakes at the end! ""Somebody put that thing in my car!""<br/><br/>My rating: 9 out of 10"
"Denver53","6","0","1","2 August 1999"," OK, but clearly for kids
","Finally saw this movie on DVD. I enjoyed Antz more, primarily because it had more of an adult sensibility (the importance of being an individual vs. A Bug's Life's cliched ""help the colony""). Also, I thought the animation in Antz was better. It was more ""wow"" because it seemed realistic. ABL was cartoony (the ants were blue!). I figure this was due to Disney's influence. Toy Story, made before Disney came on board, was edgier."
"Lubie","Null","0","1","13 May 1999"," Rubbish , I am sorry but it's awful!
","This was one of the biggest movie letdowns that I have seen. It was so boring! I am 15 and maybe I'm a little old to watch this- but that doesn't make sense when I still enjoy the Little Mermaid. Sorry, but if you want to hear voices you have heard of an and action, see ANTZ by far superior. Great for Kids, probably, but if I hear anoter song about how much we all love each other I am going to SCREAM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It was diabolical!! The jokes unfunny and brilliant animation is no substitute for a plot is it now....."
"skinny-10","6","0","3","25 April 1999"," Even the kids lost interest half way through the film!
","The characters were cleverly animated, but the story was just not that interesting. Better suited for a TV show of 30 or 60 minutes - not the extravaganza we were expecting after all of the hype."
