","Die Hard (1988) the first action film is by far one of the greatest best action movies of all time from the 80's till this day hands down. It is my number 1 personal favorite action movie of all time, I love this movie to death! I love it so damn much and I have fun watching it so much. I have to talk about this movie: It is one man army fighting against a team of terrorists with automatic weapons and plastic explosives. Bruce Willis performance was excellent in this movie John McClane is his best role ever. It is my number 1 personal favorite action movie of all time, I love this movie to death! It's stay in my heart forever. To me it felt this film realistic and it makes you think that you are alone trapped in a building against bunch of terrorists what will you do? <br/><br/>This film has heart and soul. A lot of movies have try to do that premise since, but no movie has nail it like ""Die Hard."" This is a modern day action film of the action genre. I watch this film as a teenager I even watch it with my mom it was ultimate thrill ride. I love everyone in here all the characters and the lead character. I love that McClane is alone he has no help, all telephones doesn't work he is barefoot with his gun and the only help has is from Sgt. Al Powell down there who didn't even see him at all but were both talking on a radio from cop to cop. I love that bond between those two lead heroes. I always love when McClane talks to himself whenever he was about to do something crazy. <br/><br/>It is going to be 30 years anniversary this summer 20th July. I love this film to death I am hugh fan of Die Hard films I love this film so damn much. I would really love to see this movie in a widescreen in a movie theater. It was directed by brilliant John McTiernan it is is based on a novel Roderick Thorp Nothing Lasts Forever. This is a masterpiece action film that started all action genre one man army types battling terrorists while trapped in a confined space. It was arguably the first one in the action genre. This movie has everything . It has intense Action, Drama, Thriller, twists, great dialogue, explosions, fights. Exploding building, great helicopter explosion action scenes. John McClane is one man against a whole team of terrorists. A cracking Action Thriller from beginning to end, Die Hard explodes with heart-stopping suspense! <br/><br/>It has great cast, great plot, great explosions, no shaky cam, doesn't deal with CGI, but real actions real practical effects. Great Direction from John McTiernan, great dialogues, great acting from everyone. Everyone does an excellent job. Bruce Willis is a bad ass action star as John McClane. It has a great bad-ass action hero who does impossible buy stopping the terrorists who were actually a real terrorists who try to steal the money in a vault 640.000.000$ in bearer bonds stored in the building's vault. <br/><br/>My favorite action sequences and the best part of Die Hard: McClane grabs the fire hose, ties it around his body jumps with the helicopter about to kill him. Then Gruber blows it a second after McLane jumps off the roof! It was an incredible explosion that totally takes out the helicopter. But McLane is falling down the side of the building and needs to get inside quickly this is the best scene in the movie my favorite. McClane climbs in the elevator shaft escapes Karl and his men trying to kill him. McClane shoots on the table with his gun killing Marco. (According to the director, the proximity of the gun to Willis' ear during this scene caused permanent hearing loss for Willis.) 
McClane shot's Hans and Eddie ""Happy - Trails, Hans..."" Incredibly satisfying action in a brilliant action movie! McClane try to save Ellis when Ellis try to save him self. McClane was afraid of flying and he always carry gun because he was afraid someone would have hijack it. The fight between Karl and John was excellent and well choreographed. McClane drops C4 down the elevator shaft and destroys the entire floor where the terrorists are firing from, giving the cops a chance to retreat. I love The broken glass scene. He shoot's and kills two terrorists with his machine gun to escape Hans and Karl, John McClane is forced to sprint over broken glass while barefoot the best bad-ass scene in the movie my all time favorite. Three terrorists are shooting on McClane on the roof chasing him in which he escapes in the beginning of the movie awesome. Karl shoots in an elevator shaft in which McClane is hiding a real kick-ass scene I love this film to death! <br/><br/>I love the characters in this movie: John McClane a real action hero to me that does something that no one can he stops a team of terrorists. Hans Grubar the German mastermind he was ruthless and brilliant and he would do anything to steal the money even killing people and get what he want's. Alan Rickman's performance was excellent I love him to death in this movie. I really miss the actor he was the best villain of the whole world. The LAPD Supervisor (Diana James) I like that girl she was so good when McClane call's her for help, I love it. I love Sgt. Al Powell how he stand's up and defends McClane against his supervisor. Reginald VelJohnson does a brilliant performance as a great supporting hero in this movie. I love Deputy Police Chief Dwayne T. Robinson to death he is my favorite character in here. Paul Gleason was so good I love his performance - ""kick ass."" I love how he tried everything to safe the hostages including SWAT team who were badly hurt. I like Richard Thornburg in this movie who is annoying reporter but I still like it. Bonnie Bedelia as Holly McClane's wife was great.<br/><br/>John McTiernan directed excellent this masterpiece Jeb Stuart and Steven E. de Souza wrote a script that it delivers. The helicopters in here were models in this movie delivered, to me the action scenes felt realistic. This movie has ton's of action and you never get bored with it. Michael Kamen made a music score and you never get bored with it. You'll see lots of heavy automatic and explosive weapons, and you'll see them used well. The film is violent, and bloody rated R with real blood squibs. <br/><br/>10/10 it is my favorite action film in the action genre I love this film to death it is my personal action favorite film. I miss movies like this I miss action movies like this one today I want them back. It is a shame we don't have movies like this today."
"MadReviewer","9","347","464","31 July 2001"," The Perfect Modern Action Film
","""Die Hard"" is the prototype type for the modern action film.  Since it's also one of the best action films ever made, that happens to be a very good thing.  ""Die Hard"" is lean, mean, and doesn't contain a single second of wasted screen time. The direction, the action, the story, the acting . . . every aspect of this film comes close to big-budget action movie perfection. Since ""Die Hard"" was first released in 1988, it's difficult to think of a blockbuster action film that doesn't follow the basic structure and format of ""Die Hard"" . . . or, for that matter, is better than ""Die Hard"".<br/><br/>
""Die Hard"" is about John McClane (Bruce Willis, in one of his all-time best film performances), a basically good, honest New York cop with a penchant for annoying authority figures.   Traveling to Los Angeles in a last ditch attempt to patch things up with his estranged wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia), John McClane suddenly finds himself involved in a hostage situation. Terrorists, led by the enigmatic Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman), have taken over the office building in which Holly is working, and with Gruber holding the upper hand over the LAPD and FBI forces in Los Angeles, it's up to John McClane to save the day . . . .<br/><br/>Kudos should be given to both director John McTiernan and screenwriters Jeb Stuart and Steven DeSouza -- the film is tight, electrifying, and clever, which is something few action films can ever claim.  The story isn't completely believable, but it's believable enough, and it manages to move along at a quick enough pace to where the most glaring plotholes can easily be glossed over.  There's also enough twists and wrinkles thrown into the story to keep the audience guessing as to what's going to happen next . . . and the surprises don't come out of left field, but are actually clever and well thought-out.  (The fact that McClane often relies on his brains instead of his bullets to get out of his predicaments is also a big plus.) Simply put, ""Die Hard"" is one of the smartest and savviest action screenplays ever written.  McTiernan holds up his end of the film admirably as well -- he uses the claustrophobic nature of the office building to great effect (particularly in any scene involving an elevator shaft), and he keeps the film rolling at a rollercoaster pace, building up the anticipation of the audience before unleashing the action.  A lot of recent action films just fly along at a mindless, breakneck pace, without ever allowing the story to breathe or the suspense to build . . . unlike those films, ""Die Hard"" knows how to maximize the impact of each and every scene, and that's why it stands out so clearly from them all.  With ""Die Hard"", John McTiernan puts on a perfect clinic as to how to pace an action movie.<br/><br/>As for the acting, it's darn near close to perfect.  Bruce Willis is awesome as John McClane.  As played by Willis, McClane's a smartass with a distinct disdain for being given orders . . . but McClane's also clever, and knows how to keep cool under pressure.  There's more to McClane than the stereotypical tough guy hero.  Fortunately, the role was given to Bruce Willis, who infuses McClane with the perfect mix of cocky arrogance and stone-cold heroism.  The fact that Willis plays McClane as a man often in disbelief of his own situation, and who struggles in his fight against bad guys instead of just killing bad guys with ease, like most stereotypical action heroes -- well, not only does it make the character much more believable, it's darn brilliant.  (The fact that Willis also knows how to deliver a deadpan one-liner better than anybody else in Hollywood makes the character all the better.)  There's only a handful of movies where both character and actor are a completely perfect match; Bruce Willis as John McClane is one such perfect match.<br/><br/>Also worthy of mention is Alan Rickman's performance as the villain Hans Gruber.  The Machiavellian Gruber would've been an easy villain to turn into little more than a scenery-chewing Bond villain . . . fortunately, Rickman doesn't travel the easy route.  Gruber, as played by Rickman, is cold and calculating, and actually acts smart, instead of merely claiming to be smart and then being thoroughly outwitted by the hero.  He always appears to have an ace hidden up his sleeve, and is so convincing at giving this impression, it's hard to tell throughout the film whether he or McClane truly have the upper hand.  Other actors probably could've played Gruber fairly well, but Rickman makes Gruber one of the all-time great villains.  As for the rest of the cast, they're all pretty good.  Bonnie Bedelia does a nice job as John's soon-to-be-ex-wife Holly -- she plays her with enough smarts and feistiness to break the usual ""damsel in distress"" mold.  It's also worth mentioning that Paul Gleason, who plays the obstinate police chief Robinson, pretty much sets up the modern action movie stereotype of the authority figure who refuses to heed the advice of the maverick hero.  The character is stupid to a fault, and he's wonderful because of it.<br/><br/>""Die Hard"" is a terrific example of what happens when all the pieces of a film fall together perfectly.  There simply are no weak spots or dull moments in the film.  Is ""Die Hard"" one of the best overall movies ever made?  Probably not.  But it's undeniably one of the best action movies ever made, and it just might well be the perfect modern action film.  Grade: A"
"filmpudding","10","8","8","7 November 2015"," One of the Best
","""Die Hard"" is simply put one of the very best action movies that's ever been committed to film. Absolutely everything about the movie is perfect, or very close to it. Starting with Bruce Willis as the star, who finds himself caught up, totally unprepared, in a ""terrorist"" situation where a Japanese corporation's L.A. office building is taken over by heavily armed, highly trained German terrorists (or mercenaries, or maybe just thieves.)<br/><br/>Alan Rickman is an incredible villain in this who steals every scene he's in.<br/><br/>The best part about this movie is that it is much more believable and realistic than other action movies. He's a flawed cop, barefoot, and he actually makes mistakes and gets very badly hurt. The good guys aren't perfect. It's largely luck as well as his own toughness and ingenuity that get him through each gunfight, and his need to get his wife (who works for the corporation) back from the bad guys. <br/><br/>Incredible story, pitch perfect acting, lots of great comic relief moments (the dad from Family Matters is in it!), fantastic action sequences. This movie is a must see for action lovers!"
"dee.reid","10","268","384","4 January 2005"," You'll ""Die Hard"" with this action-lover's action movie
","One could claim that 1988's ""Die Hard"" is one of the most influential action movies ever made because it basically revolutionized one of the most copied (but never matched, at least in terms of quality) formulas: a loner, by some unique twist of fate, battles it out with an ""x"" number of terrorists in an enclosed environment.<br/><br/>By the time that ""Die Hard"" was released, the action movies were most often dominated by the likes of Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone, and Chuck Norris. Star Bruce Willis, whose only notable credits at the time were television's ""Moonlighting"" and 1987's ""Blind Date,"" which was released the year before, was the unlikeliest of them all.<br/><br/>Willis was a wild card - an unlikely choice for the role of our hero ""John McClane"" - since he didn't have any action credits on his resume' and let's face it: Bruce Willis just didn't have the bulging biceps required for a role like this. But that's the beauty of his performance in this movie: he's an everyday guy, caught in a not-so-everyday situation.<br/><br/>On Christmas, McClane's estranged wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) invites him from New York all the way out to Los Angeles to spend the holidays with the family. But it requires him to make a stop at the Nakatomi offices, which is having an after-hours Christmas party. Riding for the first time in a limo, he's introduced to the suave driver, Argyle (De'voreaux White), who gives him some pretty useful advice on trying to win over the wife.<br/><br/>At Nakatomi, things of course get off to a rough start for McClane, as he gets into an argument with the wife and is left to wallow in his misery. However, those problems are about to take a backseat to the real ""party"" - twelve terrorists, led by Hans Gruber (all-purpose bad guy Alan Rickman, perfectly cast) - seize control of the building and proceed to rob the Nakatomi building of its assets, most of which include negotiable bonds and other valuables. But they didn't count on the ""fly in the ointment"" (pain in the a**) to make things hell for these so-called party crashers.<br/><br/>Certainly one of the best known action movies ever, ""Die Hard"" did receive the scorn of critics upon its 1988 summer release, but the audiences sung a completely different tune.<br/><br/>The film was most often praised for the production, with the brand-new Fox Plaza office tower serving as the fictional Nakatomi building. It was also praised for the energetic and skillful direction of John McTiernan, whose most notable credit was the action-sci-fi thriller ""Predator,"" which was released the year before and starred Arnold Schwarzenegger.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis was the perfect actor for this performance, since he brings the wit and vulnerability to a role like this one. If Stallone or Schwarzenegger were in this movie, I'm sure the effect would have been a lot different.<br/><br/>Personally, I think ""Die Hard"" is one of the greatest action movies ever, up there close to my favorite action movie of all time, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" Like Indiana Jones in that film, ""Die Hard"" had an Everyman cast in the role; McClane, like Indiana Jones, wasn't a larger-than-life musclebound grotesque: he was a real guy that you cared about, who got hurt, and had real feelings.<br/><br/>That's why I think both of these movies have sort of stood the test of time as becoming what they are best known for today: action classics, and they're here to stay, ladies and gentlemen.<br/><br/>10/10"
"rickhavoc1","10","7","7","19 September 2007"," The Action Masterpiece that Redefined the Genre
","This is the action movie that redefined the genre, spawned a host of imitations, and launched Bruce Willis to international super-stardom. He also redefined the action hero, along with Mel Gibson. John McLane (Willis) comes to L.A. to spend Christmas with his family and try to reconcile with his wife, Holly (Bonnie Bedelia), who took their children there to advance her career. Why is it that when a woman breaks up her marriage to advance her career it's admirable, but if a man does it, he's an insensitive JERK? (Personally, I see this as a prime example of feminist/liberal hypocrisy. Then they have the nerve to accuse MEN of having double standards!) Anyway, he goes to meet her at a Christmas party at her office, and gets mad at her when he finds out she's using her maiden name. As he's berating himself in the private room for starting an argument with her, a gang of thieves come in, kill all the guards, cut off all outside communications, take everyone at the party hostage, and try to get the head honcho, Joseph Takagi (James Shigeta), to give them the access code to the security vault so they can steal $650 million worth of bearer bonds. When he tells the ringleader, Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman), that he doesn't know the access code, which changes every day, Hans blows his brains out, with John hiding in the room watching. We soon come to know that Hans has the most dangerous combination of traits, high intelligence and total amorality. He then proceeds with his plan, which is to PRETEND to be terrorists, because he's studied the FBI's terrorist response plan, and intends to use it to help them break into the security vault. I'm not going to reveal much more of the plot. Instead I'm going to discuss how Bruce changed the character of the action hero forever, and showed great acting ability in the process. Previously, action heroes had generally been portrayed as fearless one dimensional characters who were so tough they could go through anything and anybody who stood in their way with hardly a scratch. To give them credit, both Arnold and Sly tried to give some of their characters added depth, but neither of them had really developed the range to be convincing at that stage of their careers. Bruce broke the mold by portraying John McLane as a normal guy who happened to be a police detective caught up in an abnormal situation. At first he's frightened and tries to get some outside help, but when he realizes the thieves are controlling all outside communication, he uses his brains to become the ""..fly in the ointment. The monkey in the wrench. The pain in the a$$."" to both disrupt the thieves' planned timetable and get them angry. Because he knows that the angrier he makes them, the less clearly they'll be able to think, and the more they'll concentrate on trying to kill him instead of sticking to their plan. He also knows this'll give him the chance to whittle down the opposition. He also shows vulnerability, fallibility, frustration, pain, anguish, and determination. He also uses a good deal of profanity, but it's never gratuitous. He uses it to control his own fear and to put his enemies even further off balance. I understand that Bruce ad-libbed many of his one-liners.<br/><br/>Finally, I've only seen one other commenter that got the real point of this movie. John McLane's primary motivation through all of this is LOVE! All he wants is to get himself and his wife out of the situation alive so they can go home to their children. So the real point of this movie is that true love truly does conquer all! What real man doesn't hope somewhere in his heart that if HIS woman were in such deadly danger that HE would have the love and the courage of John McLane? That's what lifts this movie head and shoulders above all the mindless action movies, and makes it not just a guy movie, but a movie a guy can watch with his best girl, and tell her that he loves her enough that HE would run barefoot through broken glass to save her life if he had to. That's why I consider this movie a masterpiece and rate it at 10/10. Yippie-ki-yay, motherf#&%er!"
"Robert_duder","10","24","30","7 February 2007"," Was there Action Films before Die Hard?? Who cares!! Die Hard is the patriarch of modern action.
","Of course the Action Genre existed before Die Hard. After all you had The Terminator, Commando, Top Gun, Roadhouse...but didn't Die Hard absolutely revolutionize the eighties action Genre. It came like a savior and encompassed everything that would blow you right out the back of the theater and made Bruce Willis an absolute idol in the Action world and for good reason. Die Hard had pointless nudity, scores of bad language, bloody death, guns, explosions, a gritty, tough as nails, sweating, dirty hero that takes on everyone with nothing more than a hand gun and his brains. If you watch Willis in Die Hard it's a thing of beauty. His shirt torn off, bare foot, wounds all over him...he looks like he just crawled from a war rather than stalking terrorists through an enormous high rise office building in L.A. The script was so dead on...it was basic, it was to the point, it has great sarcastic humor and one liners that could never be forgotten. And Willis was the man to pull it all together. Add a decent supporting cast, a guy on the ground who is like his partner and a MacGyver style of killing bad guys that will go down in history...THIS IS DIE HARD.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis was brought up right in the Prime of his TV Series Moonlighting where his irresistible charm and personality made him a hit. John McLean was David Addison but with a lot more guts and a lot more ammo. That only made the film more exciting to fans of Willis already. Willis has a way of just making everything edge of your seat and everything believable. Who else could make you smile in fear when he's diving out of a 30 story window attached to a fire hose while the roof of the building is exploding. He really doesn't single handedly make the film...the supporting cast is terrific. Bonnie Bedelia is great as McLean's straight laced, professional and estranged wife. They make an odd yet touching couple. They have some electricity and it's ironic and yet sensible that they don't end up together throughout the series. Still Bedelia is a great female lead and her character is strong and not at all misused in the role. Alan Rickman is just one kick ass bad guy. Can you say anything else?? As terrorist Hans Gruber he is terrifying, evil, brilliant, and you just despise him and you can't wait to see him go up against Willis and he does. He doesn't stand a chance but Rickman is still brilliant as the bad guy. Reginald VelJohnson plays a small yet very important role as Willis' guy on the ground on the other end of a walkie talkie. They don't know each other, and barely know each other's name but yet they become as close as partners and they too are odd together and yet fit. William Atherton has to be mentioned even though it's a very small role, it's Die Hard history that he plays slimy, tabloid reporter Richard Thornburg who gets his just end by Holly McLean's fist which becomes a running joke in the series.<br/><br/>Die Hard is everything that people would look at in disgust now in the new millennium and yet it was everything the eighties stood for when it came to action and heroes. McLean has a cigarette dangling from his mouth, blood pouring everywhere, and a happy ending despite all the destruction around them. If you haven't seen Die Hard you can't ever proclaim yourself an action fan because Die Hard IS action. It's the film every action film strives to live to and will never meet...whether it was before 1988 or after. We won't ever get something like this again. It's an absolute 100% classic!! for all the wrong reasons!! 10/10"

Though there are no twists or curves thrown at the audience, the audience can be assured they will be treated to two hours of non-stop action from beginning to end.<br/><br/>""Die Hard"" did not only produce great action and explosions but future stars as well. I am talking about Clarence Gilyard Jr. who starred in Walker, Texas Ranger and Reginald VelJohnson who starred in the series ""Family Matters."" These two actors were pivotal to this film in their respective roles.<br/><br/>Two other names to keep in mind while thinking of key performers are Bonnie Bedelia and Alan Rickman. I was blown away when I saw the impact they had on this film. It is as if they came in and said 'Okay boys, watch out I'm taking over."" They certainly did that; however, nobody could have done better than the impact performer himself Bruce Willis.<br/><br/>On a scale of 1-10; ""Die Hard"" is given a 100 by yours truly.

"gogoschka-1","10","131","190","27 July 2014"," The ultimate thrill-ride – and still the standard by which I judge an action movie
","Seeing 'Die Hard' for the first time as a teenager was a one-of-a-kind experience. This level of raw, ""edge-of-your-seat"" action was unknown to me prior to this film; it made my head spin and the intensity of it was nearly unbearable. When it was over, I could only think of one word: Wow!<br/><br/>For a long time - at least in western cinema - the only ""true"" action movies (by that I mean films that were all about the action and you went to see them because of the action) were the 'James Bond' movies. They had the most unreal stunts and crazy, over the top action sequences that you could imagine at the time, and they were (and still are) great fun. However, they usually lacked three vital ingredients:<br/><br/>1. A sense of realism (meaning: the hero is only human and can get hurt)<br/><br/>2. Grit (messy, unpolished action, dirty people and LOTS of swearing)<br/><br/>3. R-rated violence (showing the audience what real weapons do to the human body)<br/><br/>Well, it took John McTiernan to bring those three key elements together in 'Die Hard' - and thus the modern action film was born (it had a good run through the late eighties until the end of the nineties – then the studios figured out they could maximise the box-office by taming down the swearing, violence and sex and thus, alas, the contemporary, toothless PG-13 action film was born). Sure, there have been a couple of others before McTiernan's masterpiece ('First Blood', 'Terminator', 'Predator' - which was also by McTiernan - or 'Lethal Weapon' and probably some more), but those films could have fallen into any number of other categories as well ('Adventure-/Survival-/War-', 'Sci- Fi', 'Horror-' or 'Buddy-movie') – and I can't think of another film that was just such a relentless, pure-action-from-the-beginning-to-the-end film as was 'Die Hard'. To me, it's the ultimate thrill ride. The formula has since been repeated so many times, but the original still sets the standard by which I judge an action film. Should be seen every Christmas. 10 stars out of 10.<br/><br/>Favorite Films: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054200841/<br/><br/>Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/<br/><br/>Favorite Low-Budget and B-movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/<br/><br/>Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/"

In addition I was not thinking, 'John McClain' ""Hans Gruber' or 'John McTiernan' that was my first error.<br/><br/>As I took in the very first minute of the film, I knew, this was going to be radically different than I had imagined. <br/><br/>This movie and John McTiernan's directing (Also 'Preditor'-1987 'The Thomas Crown Affair'-1999) (The Hunt for red October) (Medicine Man)<br/><br/>The way I felt from his genius directing style, that gets you fully involved, stomach wrapped in knots, pulse pounding.

I was shocked at this movie, which gets 'compared to' all the time with other action and drama movies! Still, after two decades. <br/><br/>Needless to say, it changed the way I felt about movies and film making. From Willis's flawless performance to master terrorist Hans Gruber, (Rickman) what a truly superb 'Villain' & (James Shigeta, Holly's Boss) the emotion and heart-thumping fear that lead up to the demise of James's character.

I got a copy of the original script, well the 18th re-write or something like that and went, line by line, through the story. It was unbelievable how this movie changed my mind on Movies...as well as Bruce Willis. I just can't say enough about Die-hard, but I will come to a soft close...but before I do, here is a 'spanner' of a thought, originally Willis was not first choice, it was Stallone that they wanted and he turned it down, think on that one! This would not be what it is this way, it would be wholly different with 'Sly' at the helm. I will even venture further out, do you know who this was originally written for? -Answer: Burt Reynolds.

","John McTiernan's second mainstream film manages to amazingly top an outstanding previous effort, Predator. This even better film will resonate will audiences even more than Predator. While Predator was a superbly crafted and fairly straightforward sci-fi action thriller, this film takes the archetypal imperfect everyman loner, saddled with personal issues(in the form as an estranged relationship with is corporate high flying wife) and through a twist of fate has him battling, against the odds an international team of highly motivated and competent) bank robbers while trying to protect his wife, who is amongst the hostages these robbers have taken. <br/><br/>It differed from both Predator and other action-thriller films of the period in that the hero was more human in physique, rather than the physical super-men such as Stallone, Norris and Schwarzenegger. He survives through determination and his wits rather than on brute strength, and Bruce Willis was a refreshingly original casting choice.<br/><br/>The plot is cleverly structured and sets up all the characters seamlessly. There are good performances from most of the key players. The robbers are all interesting, but clearly most time is spent with Clarence Gilyard Jr. and the late Alexander Gudunov, who are both charismatic, albeit it is their boss, the relatively unknown at the time British actor Alan Rickman, who steals the show and is terrific in this film, and makes for a worthy rival and antagonist for Bruce Willis's John McClane. Bonnie Bedelia and Reginald Veljohnson are also good value, as is James Shigeta as Mr Takagi. However a couple of the characters do stray into caricatures, notably De'Voreaux White and Hart Bochner as Argyle and Ellis respectively. Fortunately the other performances and the film itself as so fast paced and involving you can overlook these slightly over the top performances, and they do not detract from the enjoyment of the picture.<br/><br/>The good performances are woven into an expertly crafted film. Technical credits are outstanding. Jan De Bont's photography is stylish, and makes fantastic use of the Fox Plaza Tower to double for the Nakatomi building. He also makes clever use, but not over use of lens flares to create an excellent mood and atmosphere. Frank J Urioste's stunning editing, Michael Kamen's great music and Richard Edlund's brilliant but incredibly subtle visual effects all work together with truly fantastic action sequences and stuntwork, and director John McTiernan deserves huge credit. He draws out entertaining performances from most of the cast, but mixes this brilliantly clever setting up of the characters, and then orchestrating some truly outstanding action sequences with a pervading atmosphere of growing tension and suspense. It has stood the test of time brilliantly, it still by some way the best of the series, and overall comes off as a truly outstanding and emotionally satisfying thriller.<br/><br/>Overall a terrific achievement that has not been bettered."

","All I can say is WOW....OK, I lied, I can say more.<br/><br/>Die Hard is one of those movies that is all good action and a good plot: something very rarely seen in the action genre, but it does exist apparently.<br/><br/>NYPD Officer John McClane (Bruce Willis) is in L.A. visiting his wife, Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) at her office for a party. However, a band of European terrorists led by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) soon storm the place and take everyone hostage, except for McClane. Its up to McClane to stop the terrorists and save the hostages.<br/><br/>Acting-wise, everyone should have gotten an award for their part. Not a single weak performance here, also no unlikable characters, you pretty much appreciate everyone.<br/><br/>Willis' character was the best by far. He was funny, skilled and there was no way you couldn't like him or at least get a laugh or two out of his comments or sneaky tactics.<br/><br/>There is plenty of action along with enough background to adequately cover everyone's motives.

Alan Rickman is a superb villain and Hart Bochner plays Ellis: one of the funniest film characters i have ever seen (show him the watch..go on show him the watch). for me however the real gem is the films ""heartwarming"" moment at the end.

","On Christmas eve, John McClane(Bruce Willis) is over at his wife's office party when hi-tech thieves break into said building and look to steal millions of dollars. While collecting hostages in the process, however there is one man who saves the day and it's McClane in what is one of the greatest action movies ever made. I must admit that i'm shocked it took so long to for me to review this. Over the years this has been in my DVD collection, I try to watch it on TV every time it's on and most of all I think it's there with The Terminator,Hunt For Red October and Rocky as the ultimate genre film. The real reason why Die Hard is so great is due to the suspense factor. Sure the action sequences are brilliant and very exciting but what really earns the high marks is just how suspenseful the movie is, it's one of those movies where the hero actually does the most logical things. Unlike the sequels per say, Willis uses the element of surprise and cunning to fight off the bad guys. Unlike the sequels where he was far more one man army. As it stands I remember seeing Die Hard in theaters and remembering being very skeptical of Willis (He was on that show with Cybil Shepherd) but knew right away after watching Die Hard, that Willis would be a great. However as it stands, this movie is a classic. On the other hand it's also a rare instance where one might want to buy a special edition DVD for the extras. Also of note is Alan Rickman who is one of the greatest bad guys ever.<br/><br/>* * * * out of 4-(Excellent, A Must See)"
"MaximumMadness","10","7","8","6 January 2017"," ""Die Hard""- Quite simply the greatest action-adventure film ever made.
","It's almost unfathomable that in just one year's time, the original entry in the ""Die Hard"" saga will be thirty years old. And yet, even then, it will still remain in its position as indisputably the greatest action-adventure ever committed to the screen. In every way remarkable, entertaining and breathlessly exhilarating, it is the quintessential gold-standard when it comes to action. A masterpiece of filmmaking, ""Die Hard"" took the world by storm in 1988 and even with inconsistent quality in sequels, it still enthralls and entertains thanks to sharp writing, perfect casting, exquisite performances and top-notch direction. It's hard to imagine that anything will ever top it.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis stars as Detective John McClane, a New York cop who flies out to Los Angeles to spend Christmas with his estranged wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) and children. Arriving at a massive Christmas Party at Holly's workplace in Nakatomi Plaza, things start to seem like they might be looking up for John... until a group of terrorists, lead by the vile Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) seize control of the building, hoping to get their hands on over half a billion dollars in bearer bonds that are locked away in the vault. Escaping the threat and discovering that the police will be completely unable to help, John realizes he must work alone, eluding capture and taking out terrorists one by one if he is to save the day...<br/><br/>Directed by John McTiernan from a script by Jeb Stuart and Steve E. de Souza, the film as just exquisitely assembled. McTiernan's keen eye for visuals and perfect sense of pacing and composition allow the tension and excitement to build with virtually every second as the story progresses and the stakes rise. But he also knows when to pull back and give the characters breathing room to develop and just talk with one another, without rushing through it or over-relying on broad archetypes as many more modern filmmakers do. Absolutely amazing direction. The screenplay (inspired loosely by the Roderick Thorp novel ""Nothing Lasts Forever"") is exceptionally well put- together. de Souza and Stuart craft an instantly identifiable and highly likable cast of characters- including villains you very much love to hate- that all get their proper moment to shine and all feel well-defined and developed. The structure of the film is also very sound, and they strike a perfect balance between story and action in a way few other films have.<br/><br/>We are treated to one of the finest casts to ever populate a tale of adventure in the film. Much has already been said about Bruce Willis and his iconic turn in the role of McClane, but it is still not enough. Bruce Willis just might be the ideal action hero. He's tough, but not unstoppable. Smart, but not a genius. And sharp- witted, but with a certain sense of vulnerability. In many ways, he's the sort-of person anyone and everyone can identify with, and that's what makes McClane such an incredible hero. Alan Rickman- in his first starring role- absolutely steals the show as the villainous Hans, a presence who will charm you, even while you root for him to go down. Rickman is a talent that was taken too soon after his tragic passing last year, and it's roles like this that prove just how great a loss it was. Supporting roles by the likes of Bedelia and William Atherton are exceptional for the material. And Reginald VelJohnson is just magical as Sgt. Al Powell, a cop who offers support to McClane over the radio throughout the film's runtime.<br/><br/>Beyond the cast, the direction and the writing is just simply a phenomenal overall production. Cinematographer Jan de Bont, who would later go on to become a director in his own right, paints a beautiful cinematic image, with outstanding work done, particularly in the lighting and color. Composer Michael Kamen's score is just a blast of pure fun. With a sort-of old-fashioned scope yet a modern flair, the music constantly and consistently compliments the images on-screen perfectly, and it's such a relief that his themes were used in each subsequent film. And editors Frank J. Urioste and John F. Link expertly manipulate the footage so that every shot... every emotion... everything is in service to the story and characters. Now THIS is how you film and cut an action film!<br/><br/>In the end, ""Die Hard"" may soon be turning thirty years old, but it remains as exciting, engaging and enthralling as ever. Upon initial release, it became the perfect example of an adventure done right, and blew audiences away. And it continues to do that now. I honestly have my doubts that anything will ever be able to beat it in terms of quality in storytelling and execution of action. It simple is the best action movie ever made. And for that, it easily earns a perfect 10 out of 10."
"TheLittleSongbird","10","26","38","15 May 2010"," Not only the best of the Die Hard franchise but one of the best movies of the action genre
","Even if the non-action parts are a tad slow in comparison, that is more than compensated by so many things that makes Die Hard so brilliant.<br/><br/>For one thing the action is explosive and consistently exciting, and the cinematography is astounding being very inventive and colourful. John McTiernon(The Hunt for Red October, Last Action Hero) directs briskly and efficiently, and the pacing a vast majority of the time is exhilarating.<br/><br/>Then there is a terrific score by Michael Kamen, some intelligent and witty scripting and a plot that doesn't feel forced or convoluted. Not to mention some excellent acting. As good as Bruce Willis is, yes his character is somewhat two-dimensional, but he is also resourceful and world-weary and Willis handles this really well, it is Alan Rickman who steals the acting honours as Hans Gruber. Gruber is cold, calculating, suave and menacing, in my opinion only Rickman could do justice to such a character. Overall, a superb movie, not only the best of the Die Hard franchise but one of the best of the action genre. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

","Die Hard is not simply one of the best action films ever made, but one that is easily able to stand the test of time, and do so in style. Die Hard shines brilliantly with some clever set pieces, action sequences, fun dialogue, and some great performances. Bruce Willis and Alan Rickman are obviously the greatest standouts in this 80's classic. It's surprising to say that audiences at the time were not too thrilled with the idea of him as action hero, and against all odds, he delivered a more than well, not to mention iconic, performance that simply no one could ever come close to capturing the same charm. Alan Rickman at the time was practically unknown, and with him as Hans Gruber, it's certainly a job well done into his life of stardom. Some other great performances include Bonnie Bedelia as Holly, Reginald VelJohnson as Al, and De'voreaux white as the limo driver Argyle. The film is also fantastically shot, surprisingly well written (for the most part), and wonderfully coordinated. In the end, Die Hard is not only a legitimate classic with more than enough reasons to justify it, but a timeless one as well.

"pere-25366","10","4","4","5 August 2016"," Few have lived up this thrilling story
","Die Hard still remains, to this day, one of the best action films of all time. Directed by John McTiernan (The Hunt for Red October, Predator) and written by Jeb Stuart (The Fugitive), the story packs a great amount of action and suspense with memorably immortal characters.<br/><br/>The acting: This was the film that propelled Bruce Willis to absolute stardom. Starring as the charismatic Officer John McClane of the NYPD, Willis lacks the Schwarzenegger-esque physique but shows us you don't need bulging muscles to defeat your foes. Rather, he is presented as the everyday Joe who is thrust into a flurry of German terrorists. His screen presence is strong throughout, with his witty one-liners (Yippy-Ki-yay, motha*****) and believable character development. There are smaller details presented where Willis reveals more of a vulnerable side to him (usually when he is alone) that perfectly contrasts his 'cop machismo'. As he barely escapes one threat presented after another, we are reminded that this is a normal guy in a highly abnormal situation.<br/><br/>Another character who absolutely owns his screen time is Hans Gruber, played by an electric Alan Rickman. He gives a spectacular performance as the leader of the terrorists - conniving, intelligent and also has a comical side. His subtly sinister demeanor keeps us on the edge of our seat and we relish his every move. Perhaps that is why Die Hard has succeeded where so many other action films have failed. We are equally engrossed by both the virtuous and villainous figures presented.<br/><br/>The screenplay: Taking place in predominantly one area for the majority of the film, Die Hard delivers one taut thrill after another. The sense of realism and grittiness does not seem too far-fetched, even for an action flick. The explosions are not superfluous and the gore is not unnecessary – it all helps in developing McClaine's character and shows us the right extent of how chaotic things become for him.<br/><br/>I particularly loved the meta-humor (""This time John Wayne does not walk off into the sunset with Grace Kelly."" ""That was Gary Cooper, a**hole."") And banter was common in this film, whether it being between Hans and John, John and Office Powell. The superb dialogue, acting and direction manage to elevate this film an echelon above its action-film wannabes."
"supergamer125","10","4","4","16 August 2015"," One of the best action movies of all time!
","Die Hard is really a work of art. It was one of the most influential action films today. Filmmakers are always trying to make the Die Hard of today. Die Hard is about a vulnerable everyday man trapped in a small restrictive area, and completely outnumbered.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis plays John McClane, a New York cop that is going to LA for his wife's Christmas party at her work. Meanwhile a team of 13 terrorist, (not 12 like it says) lead by Hans Gruber played by Alan Rickman take over the Nakatomi plaza. Now it's up to John McClane, the man at the wrong place at the wrong time to stop the terrorists' plot.<br/><br/>The acting from everyone is top notch. Willis is incredibly likable as John McClane and the supporting cast all do good with their roles. But the show stealer is Alan Rickman, who brings a sense of sophistication and class to the diabolical Hans Gruber. He is a guy you love to hate.<br/><br/>One of my favourite things about the Die Hard series is the character of John McClane. I love his attitude, he kind of is a jerk that butts heads with a lot of figures who disagree with him like the police in this movie. But he still cares about people, which is why he became a cop. I love his relationships with the villains which is usually full of teasing, arguing and insulting each other which is always fun to watch.<br/><br/>The film is a excellent blend of very intense moments, gripping drama, great action and stunt work, and a good sense of humour. Die Hard has stood the test of time as one of the greatest action films of all time."
"mrmoviefreak261-1","10","4","4","14 August 2008"," Die Hard-probably the best action film of all time
","I praise this movie just because it's a great action film. And it has great acting which makes it a classic. And so on. John McClane. After watching this movie, that's a person you would like to become. It starts with John McClane flying into California to see his wife in a tall forty-story skyscraper. He's a New York cop, and of course he's confused and disgusted with the California mood and humor. Then the terrorists arrive. Coincidence that it's the same night John McClane has arrived. John sneaks out unnoticed and tries to save all the Californian hostages and his wife from the death-threatening terrorists. He's a cop, so he has skill. Another good thing about this movie is that most of it is believable. Some can disagree, but for the most part, it's pretty realistic. Die Hard is both violent, which is good for this film, has lots of cursing, which some people can find unnecessary, but I think it's great, and the movie is sometimes humorous. I enjoyed watching this movie, just because it's good. Just plain good."

""Die Hard"" stars Bruce Willis as New York officer John McClane, a cop who gets trapped in a high-rise in LA when terrorists come to steal a substantial sum from the building's safe. He single-handedly ends up defeating the entire team of terrorists. Although the film's action scenes are great (especially the classic one involving McClane jumping out of the building holding onto a fire hose), it is the interactions between McClane and Sergeant Al Powell (Reginald VelJohnson) and villain Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) that make the movie what it really is. Rickman plays one of the greatest movie villains, as he combines evil with humor, as every villain should. His performance was Oscar-worthy, in my opinion. It's great dialogue and fun characters that set ""Die Hard"" apart from most other action movies. Its three sequels are all great too, but this film is still superior.

What's interesting to see is how McClane conquers his internal conflict in the bathroom, so he may defeat his external conflict and finally decides to get outta there to find out what the fck Hans was doing upstairs. And from the start it wasn't a rescue mission, he was having a conversation with his wife... something that started 6 months earlier, only to get cut off. Also interesting to see the antag from being passive to becoming reactive when McClane steals his detonators.<br/><br/>Very interesting to see Powell's trauma being resolved --- he swore to never draw his revolver ever.<br/><br/>Michael Kamen's upbeat and tense score is unforgettable, in my book. I especially like the track -- during the scene where Hans hands Ellis the walky-talky. Listen closely and see if you get reminded of ""Singing in the Rain"" or Beethoven's ""Symphony no. 9"" as the movie goes on.<br/><br/>Some of the best lines ever... e.g. ""After all you speeches, you're nothing but a common thief""...

","Quite possibly the best modern action movie since the classic ""Dirty Harry"", ""Die Hard"" simply rocks. Based on the interesting novel ""Nothing Lasts Forever"" by Roderick Thorp, ""Die Hard"" made headlines for its combination of a terrific cast, excellent script, amazing action sequences and superb direction.  Headed up by screen favorite Bruce Willis (The Sixth Sense), ""Die Hard"" also features the talented Alan Rickman (Galaxy Quest) and Bonnie Bedelia (Needful Things).  Directed by action veteran John McTiernan, the mastermind behind such action spectaculars as ""Predator"", ""The Hunt For Red October"", ""The Thomas Crown Affair"" (1999), and ""Die Hard With A Vengeance"".<br/><br/>In the role that shot him to stardom, Willis plays Detective John McClane, a hard-hitting cop from New York on Christmas Vacation in LA.  He is there to visit his wife (whom he is separated from), Holly Gennaro, who recently got a great job working for the Nakatomi corporation and has permanently moved to Los Angeles with their two children.  John arrives at Nakatomi Plaza expecting a fun Christmas party and a relaxing night.  Man was he wrong!  A few minutes after getting settled, twelve gun-toting Eastern Europeans take the entire 30th floor hostage.  The supposed terrorists are headed up by the brilliant megalomaniac Hans Gruber (Rickman), who actually wants the $640 million dollars inside the floor's vault.  Somehow, McClane escapes upstairs armed only with a handgun and starts causing a ruckus, slowly hunting down each well-equipped thug.<br/><br/>""Die Hard"" succeeds is because it presents every challenge McClane has to face realistically and clearly.  As the tension mounts, the ordeals for John become increasingly harder.  First, it's just a terrorist.  Then a whole slew of them.  Later, it's the NYPD and even the FBI!  Director McTiernan gives the film a good pace and makes the film work by showing that John isn't superhuman; he only uses his brain more than his gun.  Also, screenwriters Jeb Stuart (The Fugitive) & Steven E. De Souza (48 Hrs.) add touches of humor that lighten up the viewer and classic one-liners (""Yippy-Ki-Yay, !@#$"") that ignite the screen.  Their subplots actually add to the story instead of overcomplicating it, especially one featuring good cop Sgt. Al Powell (Rejinald VelJohnson of TV's ""Family Matters"").<br/><br/>Overall, this movie was awesome.  Willis is very believable and has significant screen presence.  Character development is superb, and even though Stuart and De Souza leave some loose ends untied - like how  a man gets hung with a chain and still comes back for more - the film remains to be an action classic.  Note to Parents: the nudity, drug use, continual profanity, and extreme violence would make this a bad choice for kids under 13.  Otherwise, see ""Die Hard"" ASAP!

","There was a moment in an early scene of Die Hard when John McClane (Bruce Willis) is having an argument with his wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) in the executive washroom in Ellis's office. It's scripted so that the two of them end up talking over each other about what McClane's idea of their marriage is, and it's such an honest depiction of estranged spouses that I find myself forgetting what movie I'm watching when I get to that part.<br/><br/>Granted, not everyone has a terrorist takeover of their office building to teach them not to take each other for granted, but it works here.<br/><br/>That scene is one of the great things about Die Hard, not because it contributes anything to the action, but because it contributes everything to the characters. Most action films before and after this seem violence-driven, but this one manages to balance the humanity of its protagonist, and I can't even begin to measure how much of that balance comes from that one scene.<br/><br/>I think the other thing that most defines the spirit of this movie is McClane's shoes. It's such an obvious contrivance, set up right from the beginning, but it's worked into the entire story so artfully that I have completely forgiven it every time I've seen the film. Of all the bad luck, to be caught in the middle of a terrorist attack and then have to chase the bad guys around a 40-story building, all without shoes.<br/><br/>But, as McClane himself says, it's ""better than being caught with your pants down."" I know how much of the plot and the action hinges upon luck, timing, strong fingertips, and the Rube Goldberg machinery of the FBI-terrorist interplay, but I really don't care. I still get caught up in the nervous moments of this movie 18 years later. I still ache along with McClane as he pulls a three-inch piece of glass out of his foot in the emergency lighting in the bathroom. And I still root for him to get the bad guy, rescue his wife, save his marriage, and meet Al Powell even though I must have scene this movie 30 or 40 times already, and I know he's going to do it again the next time.<br/><br/>This is a great film, and easily the best written and best executed action movie I have ever seen. But more to the point, and more importantly, it's a fun movie to watch, no matter how many times you see it."

","When you see this in the shops you can only think of that line, it's one of the true films to be an Action film from start to finish. The best part of this film is it's ages really well, you would think it was made only yesterday, it has one of the biggest stars in history of films Bruce Willis.<br/><br/>OK so on to the film, it starts like any other film and sets the scene for what is a roller coaster ride that will leave you wanting more at the end. In the beginning we see John Mcclane (Bruce Willis) on a plane on his way to Los Angeles, the reason he is going there is to meet his wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia who looks really attractive in this film) and it's Christmas Eve.<br/><br/>He goes to the Nakatomi Corporation building which is where Holly works to see her and be there for his kids who he hasn't seen in a while, but during the time there he has abit of a fight with her and she gets called to give a talk, anyway John is in the bathroom insulting himself in the way how Bruce Willis does, and he ends up taking his shoes off (the person who he is sat next to on the plane says the best way to get over flying is to take your shoes off and walk bear foot and make fists with your toes...personally never tired it). During the time little does he know that a group of terrorists are planning on taking over the building (this all happens in the first 20 minutes or so).<br/><br/>The film then really starts to go into its own as we follow an average police officer from New York in LA trying to just to get home for Christmas, still more about this film. Upon noticing that the building is being taken over by terrorists John escapes and heads to the top floor with work is still going on, and sets off the fire alarm in an attempt to get the police there. When the terrorists find out that hes set the fire alarm off from the top floor they phone the police and tell them that its nothing to worry about and send someone up to kill him, John pleased with his attempt to get back up there looks out the window and swears at them for coming to his aid, then notices they turn around.<br/><br/>At this point they send someone up to take him out, and the person ends up getting killed, John having a wicked sense of humour (on both levels of the word) sends the dead body down the lift and takes as much as he can like the machine gun, and cigarettes as you do when your in that sort of situation, and tries on the shoes only to find they are too small. He also writes an amusing note on the persons jumper, meanwhile hes in the lift above the one that stopped taking notes on what hes up against.<br/><br/>Later on John goes to the roof of the building to transmit a cry for help to the police and has a fairly amusing conversation on to the police, anyway at this time he gets cut off due to being attacked by the other terrorists, and they choose to send a police officer to search to see if John was telling the truth, anyway the terrorists and John are having a shoot out in one of the offices, and to get the attention John uses his head he throws the body out of the window.<br/><br/>Now that he has some help the film moves onto a new level and the action increases more, as police road bloke outside and the FBI get involved the scale of this film (which by the way was made in 1988) starts to show. As John gets in situations and the action increases and has loads of twists and turns.<br/><br/>In my view this film has everything to be one of the best if not they best film out there, the scale of it is amazing and the cast is true great. Words cant really describe this film, you really have to watch it, but the film does leave you wanting more and does leave you wanting to watch the next one in the series. I could talk for days about this film and it's action sequences from the very small gun fights to the massive C4 explosion and the plot which doesn't seem to lose it's appeal even after watching it infinite times, and also it's feel good factor at the end when John is back with Holly and they are in the snow (lets face it you knew they would live) but it's got something that does make you want to watch it over and over. If they made more films like this then people would probably remember what cinema is about and we may have really memorable hero's like we use to.<br/><br/>This film should be a benchmark for ever other film that is out there trying to be an action film with a strong story, lets face it on paper it's a simple story terrorists want a building for money, they take it over, then John gets caught up in this mess...it's not hard really.<br/><br/>But then maybe people like it because it's simple, however I think they like it, or i I like it because it's so original and has never been done before, even Die Hard 2 and 3 they push the idea of films harder and further than before. They go that one more to make it fun and try to make the story still remain simple. It's one film you have to watch and it really should be in the top 250 on IMDb."
"euqamratz","10","15","21","16 July 2006"," Action Packed From Start To Stop
","I'm a great fan of Bruce Willis and the fifty odd films which he has starred in, but his role as John McLane in the ""Die Hard"" series would have to be on the top of my list for the best Bruce Willis movie of all time. After watching and probably enjoying the film immensely, you realize how corny, but good the film was. The first few action sequences involve the ultimate bad guy, Hans Gruber (played by Alan Rickman in one of his more solid performances) and are great viewing. They really do set the tone for the rest of the movie, and even for the sequels to follow. But these first few scenes are upstaged by the brilliance of Bruce Willis in his many fight scenes, usually involving gunfire, glass breaking or some kind of explosion! These scenes are enjoyable and all lead to the explosive finale, which leads to a chopper going down, the roof of a building exploding, and a man falling 70 stories to his death. There's also plenty of comic relief in this film, with Argyle, McLanes' limo driver, being oblivious to the anarchy occurring above him whilst he is in the underground car park listening to music and chatting up ladies. Officer Powell, McLanes sidekick outside of the building, also provides a few good laughs. But the two main performances of Willis and Rickman take up mos of the screen time, and rightfully so, as these two characters are brilliant to watch. The Plot line is quite good for such an action-packed film, and it doesn't ever lose any of the intensity it starts out with, if it doesn't gain any that is! All in all, this is a film I recommend for anyone who doesn't take films too seriously, or just wants a good action packed film. Definitely one to put into your DVD or video collection at home."
"CuriosityKilledShawn","10","100","174","21 August 2005"," The most influential action film of the last half-century
","Die Hard had an unusual history before it even reached the screen.<br/><br/>In the Sixties, author Roderick Thorp wrote a novel, The Detective, which was turned into a movie, starring Frank Sinatra in the title role of Joe Leland. A sequel, Nothing Lasts Forever, was written, in which Joe becomes trapped in the Claxxon Oil Corporation skyscraper after it is taken over by German terrorists and he has to rescue his daughter. Frank Sinatra was contractually allowed to consider (and pass) on making that sequel, an adaptation written by Jeb Stuart. Then Steven E. De Souza was brought on board and he turned the Nothing Lasts Forever screenplay into Die Hard. The skyscraper became Nakatomi, the daughter became the wife, Leland became John McClane and several other actors, including Richard Gere and Clint Eastwood turned down the role until it landed with Bruce Willis.<br/><br/>To say that Die Hard sets new standards for action movies is like calling Bill Gates modestly wealthy. The movie was so innovative and groundbreaking that dozens of rip-offs followed - Passenger 57, Under Siege, Cliffhanger, Sudden Death, et al. Hostage/terrorist movies were all the rage in the early Nineties.<br/><br/>Very few came close, because Die Hard had so many strong points, not least of which was Alan Rickman's cold performance, as Hans Gruber - also the name of the villain in Our Man Flint - the classically educated, smartly dressed terrorist leader. Gruber would have been well at home on Wall Street.<br/><br/>His plan is to break into the vault on the 30th floor of the Nakatomi Plaza and take away $640million in negotiable bearer bonds. When he and his 12 European henchmen round up the office workers, who are enjoying a Christmas Eve party, one man slips away unnoticed. He is John McClane, a New York cop who has come to LA to settle down with his estranged wife, Holly (Bonnie Bedelia). The odds are against him. But that's just the way he likes it.<br/><br/>In his battle to save his Holly, McClane is scorched, torched, beaten, and blown up. He jumps off the roof and falls through air ducts. He uncovers deception and double-crosses, and picks broken glass out of his bare feet. No help comes from the naive and incompetent police, who are unable to get inside, and even less so from the overconfident FBI.<br/><br/>McClane is not a supercop. He is an ordinary guy, who doesn't want a fight. When he is shot, he bleeds, he hurts. All he has are his pants, his vest, his gun - which does not have infinite ammo. This is a realistic connection the audience can identify with and helps to project yourself into the movie. When you don't want to be in McClane's position, it makes for much excitement.<br/><br/>John McTiernan, who's only previous mainstream movie was Predator, uses awesome photography and technical skills to give the film a truly polished and sophisticated look that has become his signature style - it was nominated for four technical Academy Awards. He also allows for enough time for decent character development with arcs for multiple side-characters, most of which comes between McClane and a cop (Reginald Veljohnson) he makes friends with on a CB radio.<br/><br/>Die Hard manages to be exciting every single time. It's lost some of it's respect in recent years as action films, post-1999, had tried endlessly to imitate The Matrix and use digital effects in place of real stunts and worse so since 2010 with the endless, tiresome, mind-numbing over-abundance of comic book movies filled with impossible physics, which is a really big loss and signalled the beginning of the end of the true, tough guy action film."
"bob the moo","Null","18","26","12 July 2007"," Great action, well directed, tense and slick action thriller with enjoyable performances and intelligent social subtext (spoilers)
","I first saw Die Hard in the late 1980's and have owned it on various formats down the years and will watch it now and again. One of the main reasons I enjoy it so is because of the iconic place it holds within the action genre. At the time it came out we were mostly served up pumped-up action heroes who happily take on entire armies and win in battles that are mostly a simple matter of good versus evil, where good is US and evil is them (whoever them happened to be at that time). Die Hard manages to be more than that by starting out with a ""normal"" guy as our hero. Now I won't pretend that McClane is not an action hero who does extraordinary things but he seems accessible. I particularly like the fact that his first reaction is to run, to call for help form others and that he only faces the terrorists when he has to, rather than going all Rambo on us.<br/><br/>If this approach provides a grounding, the concept also brings the action into a slightly more real environment. The action is more or less confined to the tower and the bad guys limited rather than being a constantly flowing army of stuntmen. Director McTiernan uses the location really well, injecting tension and a sense of claustrophobia that works really well. The action is enjoyable and offers a lesson that modern CGI-heavy action movies can learn from  if you rely totally on technology then you'll date quickly, if you make the effects serve the action and narrative then you'll be standing for years. As a result the action in Die Hard feels no less slick or exciting for being almost twenty years old.<br/><br/>Although this is the most important part of the film to get right, I always appreciated the clever subtexts in the narrative. Filmed in the 1980's, the film is a clever attack on yuppie values in contrast with the blue-collar ""man's man"" type. In this way the narrative can be viewed as those seeking more and more wealth getting in the way of those who just want to be with their families. The most obvious attack on the business culture is the aligning of the terrorists and the corporation. Hans and Takagi share taste in suits, education, knowledge and even share the same opening lines (""ladies & gentlemen""); it is not a stretch to see the film suggesting that Takagi may have also shared some of Hans' ruthlessness in his rise to the top. This is also evident from the very start  John does not lose his wife to Hans, he has already lost her to the corporation as she drops his name and had moved away. Indeed such is the films paralleling of these two threats to McClane, that he only rescues Holly from Hans by getting the watch off her wrist  the watch that was specifically mentioned at the start of the film as a gift from the company.<br/><br/>Ellis sees the connection being made even more obvious as he himself suggests little difference between himself and Hans, apart from the gun and fountain pen aspect. Of course with both businessmen being connected to the terrorists in this way, they must also share their fate, and do. Although it has lumbered the film series with a rather poor catchphrase, the discussion of westerns again confirms the contrast between ""man's man"" and ""new man""  a connection further made by having McClane in his vest, an outfit more befitting a blue collar worker who has his values in the USA frontier rather than the cut-throat world of foreign business. This distain for bureaucracy is also seen in the redemption of Al. Stuck outside the action in the building (handicapped by incompetence) but also desk-bound due to shooting a kid. At the end of the movie he is redeemed by killing Karl in a ""quick-draw"" style shoot out, freeing him from his desk and restoring his manhood. Again the split between bureaucracy and real workers and again the use of wild-west symbolism.<br/><br/>The cast respond to the strong script and direction by turning in roundly good performances. Willis has not really been better (even in the same character) and his action twist on his Moonlighting character was the making of him. It is Rickman that dominates the film though; like in Robin Hood, he is a delightful sneering bad guy who has great lines and great presence. The support cast is good below them with Bedelia avoiding being just a damsel in distress; VelJohnson a solid ""buddy""; Godunov is a real physical threat  even if a few of the other terrorists barely make an impression on the memory. Gleason, Atherton, White and Davi all give a good show as well.<br/><br/>Rightly an iconic action movie then. The action has stood up really well and is delivered within a story that is tense and well paced. The performances suit the material and, if you want it, there is a clever and engaging subtext running across the whole film. I find it hard to fault and you can see why it has had the influence it has had on the action genre over the last twenty years."
"arthera09","9","10","13","28 May 2007"," This movie is so much fun
","I think this is a great movie. I love the campy one liners and the over the top action, but it was a great movie. It was well paced and they are no real complaints about the movie. Rickman was amazing and it is one of the best bad guys performances and the one scene when we snaps at John's wife is priceless. It is kind of fun to see how a lot of action movies pull from a lot of stuff from this movie (even though I sure this movie got a lot of it's substance from other movies). One of the highlights of the movie is the music and when the bad guys actually manage to open the vault one really feels a swelling of emotion as the music grows. The one problem I have is that the LAPD is not that dumb and the FBI agents are not that dumb and the fact that Al knew better than both of them was kind of silly, but I did like the dynamic of the two FBI agents and the way they fit into the movie as a bunch of idiots, but it was almost a little too much. The humor they tried to inject with the black guy who was cracking the vault was a little dry, but not to the point where I hated him. The limo driver's smile got annoying too, but I liked his character for the most part. Bruce Willis did a perfect job with the character and played him perfect. I like action films like this where there is unnecessary swearing and violence, but it works and I hate how Hollywood is making a lot of action films with a pg-13 rating when i think it would be so much more enjoyable with just letting them swear and be really violent. I know one does not need the violence, but I think it does so much more for the movie experience by letting the characters express themselves with their violence. The last gripe I have is that the ending with Karl jumping up out of nowhere was totally unnecessary and it really annoyed me. The cop did not need a complete arc and John's and his hug was all the ending needed. This will probably always be one of the my favorite action films."
"darthbaggins-70735","9","6","7","4 September 2016"," The Best Action Movie Of The 80s.
","The 80s Gave us many great action movies from The Terminator, Predator and The Road Warrior to Commando, Big Trouble in Little China and Escape From New York. But Die Hard in my opinion is the best of them all. The Main Character is great. He's relatable and likable and he's not a superhero, in fact he gets his butt kicked constantly throughout the movie. The Villain is also great. The Late Alan Rickman does a fantastic job playing this character. The action scenes are quite brutal and violent but very realistic. The humour is hilarious with some of the best one liners in cinema history. My only real problem with this movie is some of the supporting characters, mainly the police. Most of them are incredibly annoying and it gets so irritating when they constantly don't believe anything the main character is telling them about the terrorists. But even with that Die Hard is still my favorite action film of the 80s(And my favorite Christmas movie too)."

","Die Hard tells the story of a New York City detective named John McClane who is separated from his wife. She invites him to a Christmas party at her office building in Los Angeles, and he decides to go to work things out. Once there, a group of German terrorists come in and take hostages with the intent of stealing millions of dollars in bonds. McClane manages to escape and begins to fight the terrorists one by one to save the people in the building.<br/><br/>Die Hard is a classic film because it completely revolutionized action films. The 80s were a time of unrealistic action sequences, predictable characters, and rudimentary plots. Die Hard changed all that. Die Hard takes place in a real world setting, or at least about as real as you can get with an action movie, so the action sequences, while insane, are slightly believable. The plot of the movie is simple, yet it's so brilliant at the same time. And the characters in this movie are engaging and a lot of fun to watch. John McClane is a really likable everyman kind of guy, we can all relate to him. Hans Gruber is an awesome villain, both cold and ruthless, yet very human. The supporting characters on the outside of the building are all great as well. Another great thing about Die Hard is that even though it's a hardcore action movie, it manages to be extremely funny at some parts, almost to a point of being able to call it a comedy. This makes the movie really easy to watch over and over again. There's really nothing wrong with this movie whatsoever in any department.<br/><br/>The acting is great. Bruce Willis is hilarious and hardcore as John McClane, and he portrays the adrenaline and the frustration of the situation very well. Alan Rickman is awesome in one of his earlier roles as the main villain Hans Gruber. Reginald VelJohnson is enjoyable as McClane's outside contact Officer Al Powell, and Paul Gleason is funny as a hardheaded and incompetent deputy chief of police.<br/><br/>Overall, Die Hard is the ultimate action film because it's fast, funny, and hardcore. It also gave us one of the most famous action movie one liners of all time...You know the one.<br/><br/>8/10"

This film owes a lot to movies like the ""Dirty Harry"" series and ""Bullitt"" with Steve McQueen.

Thrilling,unexpected,dangerous etc. This is not meant to be ""real"" because this is an action film,not a documentary on terrorism or police work. <br/><br/>For non-stop action and just releasing pent up feelings of helplessness. I say more power to films like this. Only a very uneducated person would honestly believe that one person could knock out thugs like those in this movie (educated though they are).<br/><br/>Not your kind of movie? Then it's simple find something that appeals to you. As far as the sequels go,#2 is just as action packed and suspenseful,#3 is still good but it does have the feeling of ""been there before"" but it does it's job and so does Bruce Willis.

"volsdic","10","6","7","23 March 2006"," Welcome to the party pal
","This was a great start for Bruce Willis. This movie all started with John Mcclane on his Christmas vacation from New York to Los Angles to visit his wife Holly, which they were separated. John and Holly had an argument about their marriage. All of a sudden, while Holly was having a meeting, the German terrorist took over the plaza. The way how those terrorist planed their attack was incredible. All because of Theo, he know how to use computers and shutting off the elevators. And Karl played by Alexander Godunov, I had my eyes on him the way how he look suspicious with his long hair. Alan Rickman was the right actor to play as Hans Gruber, the way how he did that German ascent. As soon John accidentally killed Karl's brother during their fight all things broke lose with him, the part when Karl said "" I want blood"". The only part was so stupid was when Ellis trying to be a hero claiming to be John's friend. Ellis should of known that Hans was really going to kill him. I liked the way how John handled the terrorist situation as a New York cop. Reginald Veljohnson played as Sargent Al Powell stole the movie too. Such as, the way how Sargent Powell trusted John Mcclane, standing up for himself against Executive Chief Duane T. Robinson,including in the ending when held up his gun and shot down Karl. I also like the part when John and Hans finally met when Hans was acting like a hostage and claiming that he works for Neketomi. I think that was a challenging part for the director to put those two together. The best fight in Die Hard was John and Karl, I enjoyed that fight. All the lines in Die Hard were never broken by another movie. Such as, "" welcome to the party pal"". and "" I came by to the Christmas party by mistake who knew""."
"BroadswordCallinDannyBoy","10","6","7","25 February 2006"," A monumental film
","Bruce Willis stars as John McClane, a New York cop who flies out to Los Angeles to meet with his estranged wife at a Christms party in an LA Highrise that belongs to a wealthy company for which his wife works. Unknown to the guests, a group of terrorists headed by Alan Rickman takes everyone hostage, except McClane who manages to sneak by. Left with only his pistol, brains, and brawn McClane starts to give the bad guys hell.<br/><br/>US action pictures were never the same after this film came out in 1988 and in watching it you can easily see why. Placed in one building over one night with one hero, who could have imagined such an exciting movie? Other 80s action films, while many of them are classics, never quite managed to accomplish what Die hard did so well. It is not the relentless action nor the characterization, but both of them combined. McClane is introduced like any other cop would be and not like some big guy who is obviously going to kick ass like say Schwarzenegger was shown in Commando. This film put a real human side to its hero - he's tough as nails, but not invincible. He relies on his brains and his brawn. He winces in pain, but pushes on. And of course he snaps wise-cracks and quotable lines: I mean who can truly forget ""yippy-kah-yay, motherf***er"" after seeing this movie even once?<br/><br/>And it is not just the hero, but the villains he combats as well. They have their unlikable side and are obviously meant to be the bad guys, but they have their brains, their brawn, and of course their own weaknesses. Scripters Jeb Stuart and Steven de Souza must have gone about describing the villains pretty carefully in their screenplay and they have created a memorable bunch little army that is not your typical cardboard cut out set of villains. They range from a hacker who can't fight if his life depended on it to the mountainous assault rifle packing Karl who makes John McClane's day especially bad. Interestingly, Karl's seemingly endless fury isn't just an excuse to have a ""real tough ass"" bad guy, but it is characterized and introduced in of itself.<br/><br/>Also, the music is very well developed. Beethoven's 9th is the backdrop for the score and it is interesting to see how it was put into the story in a both diagetic and a non-diagetic level. Added to that, they even put a Christmas twist to it.<br/><br/>Finally, when you consider the fact that this one movie not only spawned an overall great trilogy, but a whole little sub-genre of ""Die Hard on a..."" makes this a great film all around. 10/10<br/><br/>Rated R: violence and profanity"

","The eighties was the decade of the big blockbuster action flick - Lethal Weapon, Beverly Hills Cop, Cobra, Commando etc. But one film outdoes them all and this is it Die Hard, the action sequences are superb and set the standard for everyone to follow. The premise is a good one and while not exactly realistic it provides a firm base for some rocking action.<br/><br/>Our main hero John McLaine (Bruce Willis) is well drawn and manages to avoid falling into the cliché trap of some action hero's, a sub-plot with his estranged wife is given just the right amount of time to provide depth without spoiling the pacing of the movie or feeling tacked on. The other main relationships in this movie is equally well played with the one good cop on the outside John forms a bond through humour and necessity and the interplay between them provides a nice counterpoint to give the audience a chance to draw it's breath.<br/><br/>Also credit has to be given to Alan Rickman as Han Gruber for creating one of the best bad guys of any action flick, Rickman seems to have a nice line in bad guy persona's as he was easily the best thing in Robin Hood Prince of Thieves playing the sublimely evil Sheriff of Nottingham. But lets face it action is what we want here and boy those it provide it, bad guys are picked off left right and centre, a rooftop shoot out and one incredible explosion.<br/><br/>If you love action movies and you haven't seen Die Hard get out there right now and get yourself a copy it'll be the best move you'll ever make.<br/><br/>9/10"

","Sure he shoots people and blows things up, but there is only one moment in ""Die Hard"" where smooth criminal Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) loses his cool: When a woman realizes what he is up to, and tells him he is nothing but a ""common thief."" ""I am an exceptional thief,"" Hans says after vaulting a desk to get in her face. ""And since I'm moving up to kidnapping, you should be more polite.""<br/><br/>""Die Hard"" likewise may be just an action film, but it is an exceptional action film, an entry in an already overcrowded field of cinematic bloodbaths that dared to be more than a little clever and insightful about the human condition even as it upped the ante on the on screen violence.<br/><br/>Hans and his Euro-goons help matters considerably, by projecting real personality along with the menace. You understand their motivations, enjoy their humor, and still relish their comeuppance at the hands of a New York City cop played by Bruce Willis who finds himself alone against the bad guys in a Los Angeles skyscraper.<br/><br/>Willis became a movie star from his performance here as John McClane, and it is very good. Willis projects his usual smugness, but manages to ingratiate himself to the audience early on in a key scene with his limo driver, Argyle, who presses him on what he's doing in L.A. if he's from New York. McClane says he's here to see his wife, who works here, and alludes to some trouble in their marriage, saying he couldn't also move to LA because of his responsibilities to the NYPD.<br/><br/>Argyle won't let up. ""You mean you thought she'd come running back before you packed your bags,"" he laughs. McClane winces, but smiles. ""You're very quick, Argyle."" It's not a major moment, but it points up a key strength of this film. Everyone in it matters. Whether it's Argyle, McClane, Hans, a cop doing what is supposed to be a routine drive-by, a cokeheaded businessman, or a gunman with a sweettooth, the brilliant script by Jeb Stuart and Steven de Souza and deft direction by John McTiernan gives everyone a certain weight and presence that adds to the proceedings.<br/><br/>For most of the film, McClane doesn't have Argyle to talk to, so he talks to the audience instead, in a series of monologues made believable by the pressure he is under (he seems to be in the habit of talking to himself anyway) that give McClane a humanity and humor unique for action films. ""Now I know what a TV dinner feels like,"" he says when crammed in a vent shaft. It's not that his one-liners are so clever, but that they come at the right times. Willis crafts a hero viewers can relate to, which makes his heroics more satisfying.<br/><br/>The film also succeeds as a straightforward caper film, since the caper itself is intelligently designed and presented in such a way we sense we know where everyone of Hans' dozen underlings are at every given moment, even when the camera isn't on them. Also, the action scenes are incredibly well-done, grittier than anything else on screen at the time yet still entertaining.<br/><br/>Okay, the picture is too glib at times, and shows Willis' hunkitude off more than I care to see. The phony business with the walkie-talkie chatter (you can't cut in on other people's transmissions the way everyone does here) is annoying, and the business with the TV reporter should have been left on the cutting room floor.<br/><br/>But ""Die Hard"" is a film every bit as brilliant now as when it came out, influential, never equaled, and incredibly fun. Rickman is a great villain. And what can you say about a musical score that encompasses Vaughn Monroe, Run-DMC, Ludwig van Beethoven, and Christmas music? This is a film that leaves nothing out in its ambition to entertain, and succeeds wonderfully."

"DavidSim240183","10","11","15","28 November 2003"," My favourite action film of all time
","I've seen many action films over the years, but few have had an impact like Die Hard. Bruce Willis gives one of the best (if not THE best) performances of his film career. This is quite simply, my favourite action film of all time.<br/><br/>Willis plays NYPD cop John McClane, who has come to LA to be with his estranged wife Holly, (Bonnie Bedelia) and their children for Christmas. To my knowledge, Die Hard is one of the few action films set at Christmas. This makes Die Hard rather unique for the genre, but the seasonal setting does nothing to detract from the action, and its still a gripping film to watch.<br/><br/>Getting back to the plot, McClane heads for the Nakatomi Plaza, a 40 storey skyscraper, Holly's workplace, to pick her up from the Nakatomi Corporation's annual Christmas party. But just after a heated discussion concerning the breakdown of their marriage, a group of German terrorists led by Hans Gruber (the brilliant Alan Rickman) seize control of the building.<br/><br/>McClane manages to escape detection, and where the action kicks into overdrive. Willis makes a very likable hero as John McClane, because he comes across as a more down to earth guy than other action heroes. An example is when the terrorists first seize the building, but instead of trying to be a hero, he just runs and tries to call for help.<br/><br/>This is believable behaviour to me, and you would expect anyone thrust into the same situation to do just that. Since the action is confined to an LA skyscraper, it makes for a more claustrophobic atmosphere and environment. With McClane crawling through air ducts and elevator shafts, the camera angles have you right in his face. In some ways, Die Hard reminds me of The Towering Inferno, the classic Irwin Allen film also set in a skyscraper. But they are still two very different films, with Die Hard being more about action.<br/><br/>McClane must now wage a one man war against Rickman's terrorists. It may sound ludicrous for one man to single-handedly pick off a group of heavily armed terrorists, but in this film it works. I think its because of Willis' likable performance of an ordinary man plunged into an extraordinary situation. I like the way he wears that white vest, that becomes increasingly dirtier as the film goes on. To me, this symbolises his transition from ordinary joe to the one man army he's been forced to become.<br/><br/>Alan Rickman oozes evil as Hans Gruber, who is principally interested in the 640 million dollars worth of negotiable bearer bonds in the Nakatomi building's vault. He is in complete control of the situation, even when McClane is causing high rise havoc with everything from automatic weapons to plastic explosives.<br/><br/>Rickman never loses his cool, and gets a lot of great lines. He even finds time to mock McClane, likening him to a cowboy. This is where McClane's famous catchphrase comes from Yippie Kayee Mother F###er. I like the way Rickman has the police (and later the FBI) at a complete disadvantage, bluffing his way past them about comrades in arms to keep them occupied. He simply weaves them into his plan, and he skillfully manipulates them to play right into his hands. This is a rare thing in an action film, where neither hero, nor villain upstages the other.<br/><br/>Reginald VelJohnson is also great as Sgt Al Powell, the only ally McClane has with the cops on the outside. Although they talk via radio, the two have great chemistry, and I like the scene when Al confides in McClane how he accidentally shot a kid, even though they've never met. This illustrates the bond between them. McClane returns the favour when asking Al if he could tell Holly he's sorry their marriage didn't work out. This shows his more sensitive side, but I think it shows depth to McClane's character, and doesn't come across as soppy. That's why he's such a great hero.<br/><br/>The stunts are incredible, in particular when McClane has to jump off the roof tied to a fire hose. I like the way he says just before he's about to jump ""Oh God, please don't let me die"", compared to some other action heroes like Schwarznegger or Stallone who would probably just jump. This again demonstrates what a realistic character he is playing.<br/><br/>Nailbiting stuntwork and spectacular pyrotechnics are impressive, and never overshadow the characterisation built upon throughout the film. The action scenes serve the plot, when in most action films, it is the other way around. There are some people who won't like the swearing (and even I found some of it unnecessary) but the film is still a masterpiece of action. Definitely John McTiernan's best film (although Predator was almost on a par) and its so stylish and witty right up to the nailbiting conclusion.<br/><br/>Die Hard even succeeds as a knowing commentary on the action film genre, dropping references to other action heroes, and exemplifies Bruce Willis as a new type of hero. One that can get hurt, one that feels pain, and one that actually has ties to the world.<br/><br/>The best of the Die Hard series, and I love the Christmas song Let it Snow, Let it Snow, Let it Snow on the end credits to remind you it is still Christmas even after all this. Not to mention how liberating it is to watch a corporate building going up in flames.<br/><br/>Die Hard set a whole new standard for action films to come. There have been many imitations since, but none have ever managed to top the unforgettable adventure of Die Hard."

"hitchcockthelegend","10","20","31","31 December 2010"," One seized tower block, one sweaty vest and one big set of action cojones.
","Based on ex cop Roderick Thorpe's 1979 novel Nothing Lasts Forever, Die Hard, directed by John McTiernan, changed the face of the action movie. Starring Bruce Willis, Alan Rickman, Bonnie Bedelia, Reginald Veljohnson, Alexander Godunov, William Atherton & Paul Gleason, McTiernan's movie went on to make over $100 million in profit at the box office alone. Spawning three equally successful sequels (at the time of writing), it began a franchise that showed that if done well, the action movie could be a dominant force in the world of cinema. <br/><br/>The set up is relatively simple, Willis plays New York cop John McLane who during the Christmas holidays is in L.A. to visit his estranged wife Holly (Bedelia). She works for the Japanese Corporation of Nakatomi, and currently she's attending the company Christmas party up on the 30th floor of the humongous Nakatomi Plaza tower block. Bad day at the office because a group of apparent German terrorists, led by the charismatic Hans Gruber (Rickman), take the whole building hostage: with one exception; McLane, who evades capture and launches a one man war against the terrorists. <br/><br/>What follows is just over two hours of high octane action, smart dialogue and technical smarts. McTiernan had already endeared himself to the action movie fan with the ball busting beef stew that was Predator in 87, a fact not lost on Die Hard's co producer Joel Silver, who clearly knew that McTiernan could smoothly shift the action from the Val Verde jungle to the urban jungle of L.A. And he did. Next was to get the right man for McLane. Richard Gere was first choice but passed, so the makers took a gamble on Willis, whose career was at a standstill after his leap from TV show Moonlighting on to the big screen with the likes of Blind Date & Sunset barely making a ripple in Hollywood. The rest for Willis, as they say, is history. McLane is an everyman hero, streetwise, even slobbish, but identifiable to many with his work ethics, desperate heroics and emotional vulnerability. Willis attacks the role with a hunger rarely seen from the big male earners in filmdom. During the two hours and ten minute running time of Die Hard, Willis as McLane changed the face of the action hero for ever; even making a dirty white vest iconic in the process; the latter of which couples nicely with the hero being bare footed throughout for a nifty bit of writing. <br/><br/>Across the board the casting is flawless, Bedelia is spunky and driven, a woman worth fighting for. Veljohnson as beat copper Al Powell-McLane's walkie-talkie buddy and only link to the outside world-is memorable because it feels real, he has his own issue gnawing away at him, but his exchanges with Willis keeps the humanity grounded as the carnage unfolds. Gleason & Atherton are wonderfully anal as Deputy Police Chief and TV Reporter respectively, while Hart Bochner as Ellis dishes out one of the best weasel turns to have ever graced a movie featuring corporate suit types. But as Die Hard resembles the great Westerns of yesteryear, much like the great Oaters, Die Hard could only be as good as its chief villain. As Willis' McLane ushered in a new action hero to copy, Rickman's uber intelligent villain set a new benchmark. <br/><br/>Snappily dressed, well versed and as charming as they come, Gruber in Rickman's hands is a villain you could quite easily root for! That's further testament to Willis' turn that Rickman doesn't walk away with the movie, both men are from different sides of the fence, good and evil, yet both are characters you can hang your hat on. Quite a trick from McTiernan that. Rickman is ably supported by the scary Godunov as right hand man Karl and Clarence Gilyard Jr. as the cold hearted Theo. Elsewhere the impact of Robert Davi & Grand L. Bush as the two cocksure FBI agents Johnson & Johnson (no relation) should not be underestimated. All the actors, of course, are indebted to the sizzling script by Steven E. de Souza & Jeb Stuart. So to is praise due to photographer Jan de Bont, who in collaboration with McTiernan, produces a camera work lesson for action movies, as the camera swoops in and around the tower, down elevator shafts and up tilt to roofs; with the fight scenes afforded a spatial sheen not expected in the confines of a tower block setting (the film was actually shot at 20th Century Fox's own 2121 Fox Plaza). Even the scoring from Michael Kamen and the sound tracking are of a high standard; check out the various ""mood"" uses of Beethoven's Ode to Joy from Symphony No.9 and Bach's Brandenburg Concerto No. 3 In G Major: Brilliant. <br/><br/>The 80s was well served by action movies with the likes of Lethal Weapon and Beverly Hills Cop proving massively popular. But just as Raiders Of The Lost Ark changed the game for action/adventure, so too did Die Hard. It's now the benchmark movie for action, a film that unlike Hills Cop & Lethal Weapon remarkably shows no signs of ageing either. It's no monkey in the wrench or a fly in the ointment, it's the daddy, and the one that all other action movies have to answer to. 10/10"

Action packed sequences, explosions, special effects and most of all superb performances with excellent dialogue.<br/><br/>""Die Hard"" is a movie I will not soon forget because the story is so well crafted. Though there are no twists or curves thrown at the audience, the audience can be assured they will be treated to two hours of non-stop action from beginning to end.<br/><br/>""Die Hard"" did not only produce great action and explosions but future stars as well. I am talking about Clarence Gilyard Jr. who now stars in Walker, Texas Ranger and Reginald VelJohnson who starred in the series Family Matters. These two actors were pivotal to this film in their respective roles.<br/><br/>Two other names to keep in mind while thinking of key performers are Bonnie Bedelia and Alan Rickman. I was blown away when I saw the impact they had on this film. It is as if they came in and said 'Okay boys, watch out I'm taking over."" They certainly did that; however, nobody could have done better than the impact performer himself Bruce Willis.<br/><br/>On a scale of 1-10; ""Die Hard"" is given a 100 by yours truly.

The pacing really is a black art, and to judge from McTeirnan's subsequent missteps, was an accident. But I have to give Bruce Willis a lot of credit. <br/><br/>We live in an era when we expect nothing to be done straight. Some ironic coloring is expected, some compact between the film and the audience that gives us traction on which to build fun. Sly, Arnie, Chuck and those others take it all so seriously. Bruce, and later Mel (with less intelligence) would first establish their character with the audience as their man, their representative in the action.<br/><br/>Then, once in a while, he'd all but look at the camera and say ""ain't this a gas, watch this!""<br/><br/>I don't pretend that Bruce is a fine actor, but he certainly reinvented film.

","1988 saw the peak of modern action films. It will be forever imitated but never bettered. White vests and catchphrases at the ready..Its DIE HARD John Mclane is a New York cop, recently separated from his wife Holly. Holly works for a big business company in the heart of California and is celebrating the opening of a new mega-plex building 'Nakatomi'. She invites on-off husband to the opening ceremony and his arrival quite nicely co-insides with the arrival of a group of party-spoiling terrorists led by a German named Hans Gruber. Good job he brought his gun then! Directed by John Mctiernan, Die Hard, saw the first and best action film with soul, and a lead hero who wasn't actually invincible. Struggling with the issues of doing his job, saving his wife, escaping from the building etc, John Mclane comes across as someone who actually has a heart, someone who can be beaten and above all, someone we can genuinely like.<br/><br/>The film follows Mclanes exploits as he scurries around the 'Nakatomi' plaza evading terrorist grasp whilst trying to help cops on the outside diffuse the situation. He's not an Arnie type character whos just there to empty a few clips, he's simply stuck in the situation and just doing the best he can, which incidentally sometimes isn't all that much.<br/><br/>There is a particularly good scene where Mclane succumbs to the likelihood that he may never escape alive and in a heartwarming scene, relays a message to a cop on the outside 'Al' to pass on to his wife. Fighting tears whilst trying to remove shards of glass from the feet of his broken body, we find that this guy is real. He's human, and very much destructible. Hence we back his corner more.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis stars as the said cop, elevating him to super stardom from then on. It was a film requiring excellent acting skills over a toned physique and casting was spot on. Alan Rickman plays the terrorist leader Hans Gruber and Bonny Bodelia Mclanes wife Holly. All parts are played superbly, further increasing the immersion.<br/><br/>Now, Die Hard IS still an action film. There's a lot of explosions, fighting, swearing and heroics but thanks to great scripting, acting and directing, it never becomes clichÃ©d. The pacing is spot on. Scenes of dialogue are freed by a gun-fight and harrowing scenes, followed by hate-fuelled violence. Its got explosions, but never too many, dead bodies, but never dwelled upon, its got swearing, but never for swearings sake and its even got a catchphrase, but even that is believable given the feelings and emotions going through Mclane as he battles for his own life as well as his wife and hostages. And thats the key to its success: Perfect pacing and perfect balance.<br/><br/>This all may sound very deep for an action film, and it probably is, but when you watch it you'll most probably think..'That was absolutely amazing' and you wont know why. Well this is best an analysis i could make. We sit there and just take for granted how much effort goes on in the background.<br/><br/>Wise people say that 'when you've done your job right, people wont know you've done anything at all' Here here i say.<br/><br/>Yipee-Kiyay! movie lovers"

","1988 and the undisputed number one action star was that Austrian body builder with the funny name with that monosylabic guy from ROCKY in second place . The thing I hated about Arnie and Sly is that their action movies were uninvolving with over blown battle scenes where the good guys never seemed to be in danger of dying . I was also going to bring the James Bond franchise into the conversation but the series became a parody when Bond stopped speaking with a Scottish accent sometime in the early 70s<br/><br/>
DIE HARD is different to the other 80s action fests with John McLane being a fairly believable genre character . Okay he`s two dimensional but that`s got to be one dimension more than John Rambo who only exists to kill a lot of nasty commies so Americans can flock to the cinema . It`s also interesting to note that McLane`s wife is used in the plot which is slightly different from how most action films work out where the hero is normally single , but that`s probably because DIE HARD as more depth to it than many contemparies. Perhaps the biggest difference is that McLane is slightly flawed as we`re shown one scene where the hero gives the bad guys something they want , not something you`d see in a Arnie or Sly movie . I won`t mention the stunts or the tightly written set pieces or how compelling they are because everyone else has beat me to it , except to say that big explosions and gun fights often overwhelm an action movie ( Bond movies are a good example ) but here they occur from the narrative instead of someone cramming them into the script in a vain attempt to thrill the audience . <br/><br/>Normally I`d have a fit that an action blockbuster is well inside the IMDB top 250 but DIE HARD does deserve to be there since it`s the best movie of its type of its era ."

","Die Hard<br/><br/>I saw this movie a few years ago and never wrote a review on it. I've found the quintessence of action movies. This is the single greatest action movie I've ever seen. My usual formula follows.<br/><br/>Plot: The plot is simple. A NYPD cop named John McClane goes to Los Angeles to visit his wife, Holly who works at Nakatomi Plaza. Later ""terrorists"" take over the building and John with his sidearm is forced to take them on. This movie has many twists and always keeps the pace moving.<br/><br/>Acting: The acting in this movie is the best I've ever seen in an action movie. Bruce Willis stars as John McClane with a stunning performance. He shows stress, fear, bravado, and creates a fallible hero who makes mistakes and is vulnerable as well. Alan Rickman in his movie debut, gives the performance of his life as Hans Gruber. Creating the perfect action villain, he even surpasses Bruce Willis in my opinion. No one gave a bad performance in this movie, everyone played their part.<br/><br/>Action: This movie is the pure quintessence of the action movie genre. This movie didn't create the action genre, but it evolved it. It made a new kind of hero who was fallible, made mistakes, and was more human. It also made a new kind of villain in the form of Hans Gruber. He was a villain who liked to let his goons do the dirty work for him most of the time but at times did it himself.<br/><br/>Although this movie has mistakes that we notice easily, we must remember every movie has those. It should not break your praise of the movie. This is a movie I define as a masterpiece of movies. A masterpiece of the genre is something that mostly only the fans of the genre will like and a few outside. A masterpiece of movies is a movie that even people who don't generally like the genre will like.<br/><br/>So I say if you love action movies and haven't seen this yet, what are you waiting for get this now. If you don't like action movies that much then still see it. I say that for every 10 people who see it at least 8 to 9 people will love it.<br/><br/>10/10"

Two things these movies tend to lack are a well structured plot and good character development.<br/><br/>In 1988, Die Hard came out. Bruce Willis, who beforehand only had Blind Date and Moonlighting to his credit, was cast as the main character, John McClane. The thing that separated McClane from any other action heroes at the time is that McClane is an average joe. He's not a robot, he's not a martial arts expert. He's just a guy, vulnerable, bitter about his failing marriage, a wiseass.<br/><br/>While visiting his wife Holly for a Christmas party at her office building, a band of well-armed ""terrorists"" seize control, locking all the exits and securing all the hostages. All except McClane. Armed with only his police issued pistol and lacking a pair of shoes, he engages in a game of cat and mouse with terrorist leader, Hans Gruber, a methodical, precise, and patient villain. <br/><br/>The supporting characters are also great; Ellis, Holly's annoying, coked-out coworker. Powell, McClane's lifeline and only friend on the outside. Dwayne, the powertripping deputy who second-guesses McClane along the way. The incompetent F.B.I. agents.

I have to give him a lot of credit because the director didn't really go on to distinguish himself. At the time, Arnold and Stallone and Chuck Norris and Steven Seagel, all the action mainstays - they took themselves very seriously. Their movies were rarely about fun.<br/><br/>Bruce is all but looking at the camera and saying ""whoopee!"". He comes pretty close with the yippee kay yay line. He makes it fun, and the fun is what we remember the most.<br/><br/>This is still holding up pretty well. ""Speed"" and all the other derivatives are not."

A sense of realism (meaning: the hero is only human and can get hurt)<br/><br/>2. Grit (messy, unpolished action, dirty people and LOTS of swearing)<br/><br/>3. R-rated violence (showing the audience what real weapons do to the human body)<br/><br/>This film had it all, and the outstanding performance by Willis was perfect.<br/><br/>A little fun fact for all you Willis fans: he was a bartender in NYC and gave a ride to a friend to an audition.

He aims to reconcile with his estranged wife, Holly, at the Christmas party of her employer, the fictional Nakatomi corporation. McClane is driven to the party by Argyle, an airport limousine driver. While McClane changes clothes, the party is disrupted by the arrival of Hans Gruber and his heavily armed terrorists: Karl, Franco, Tony, Theo, Alexander, Marco, Kristoff, Eddie, Uli, Heinrich, Fritz, and James. The group seizes the tower and secures those inside as hostages, except for McClane, who manages to slip away.<br/><br/>Gruber singles out Nakatomi executive Joseph Takagi, and says he intends to teach the corporation a lesson for its greed. Away from the hostages, Gruber interrogates Takagi for the code to the building's vault. Gruber admits that they are using terrorism as a distraction while they attempt to steal $640 million in bearer bonds in the vault. Takagi refuses to cooperate and is murdered by Gruber. McClane, who has been secretly watching, accidentally gives himself away and is pursued by Tony. McClane manages to kill Tony, taking his weapon and radio, which he uses to contact the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD). Sgt. Al Powell is sent to investigate. Gruber sends Heinrich and Marco to stop McClane, who kills them both. Powell, having been greeted by Eddie, who poses as a concierge, finds nothing strange about the building. As Powell turns to leave, McClane drops Marco's corpse onto his patrol car. After being fired upon by the terrorists, Powell summons the LAPD who surround the building.

","'Die Hard' is without a doubt the pinnacle of classic action films and a highlight of the 80s. There's only one name that terrorist fear; McClane!<br/><br/>1. In a time when a new action star was needed, a young Bruce Willis rose to the challenge amidst the likes of Schwarzenegger and Stallone. Reluctantly on a trip to Los Angeles to meet his estranged wife (Bonnie Bedelia) and kids, John McClane (Bruce Willis) finds himself under the radar of a terrorist plot on Christmas Eve. Willis really was a breath of fresh air at the time of this film's release, considering no one knew what to expect since action stars of that era were damn near body-building types.<br/><br/>2. As far as Willis is concerned, with every great hero...there must be a great villain to follow; enter Alan Rickman (Hans Gruber). Apart from '007' films, Rickman defined what a suave, intelligent and deadly antagonist can be. No matter how bad a villain is, it's equally fun to have a formidable henchman at his side, which (the late) Alexander Godunov (Karl) portrays with sheer brutality. However sad it was to hear of Rickman's passing, his legacy still lives on in his most memorable and career defining role as Hans Gruber.<br/><br/>3. Behind a great action-flick like this, stood an exceptional director. John McTiernan proved his worth in the realm of action the previous year when he directed another cult and sci-fi classic; 'Predator'. It was clearly a no-brainer having him on board and in turn, McTiernan also went on to direct the third film in the franchise: 'Die Hard: With a Vengeance'. His directing style is obvious as can be since the action sequences are well maintained so that things never get derailed or too crazy.<br/><br/>4. Reginald Vel Johnson and Paul Gleason round out the main cast, with memorable side characters as well that stand in as other terrorists and comic reliefs respectively. Willis himself adds more of the humor to the film when he finds himself in stressful situations as the film progresses. He just has a natural charm as McClane which no other action star has ever brought to a character before.<br/><br/>To find things that don't work about this film is a hard task, cause I honestly can't think of anything. When spectacle meets action, that's when you'll know that old habits DIE HARD!!!"

","It's very rare to come across an action movie that doesn't use the formula that die hard created or to come across an action movie that's as good as die hard. I'd like to thank director John McTiernan and screenwriters Jeb Stuart and Steven E de Souza for giving us the perfect 80's action film. Die hard is based on a novel called ""Nothing Lasts Forever"" by Roderick Thorp.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis plays John McClane a new York cop going to Los Angeles for Christmas to see his wife, Holly. During a Christmas party at the nakatomi plaza, a group of German terrorists led by Hans Gruber played by Alan Rickman take hostages and McClane is the only one that can stop them.<br/><br/>The performances in this movie are great. Bruce Willis as John McClane is perfect. He is a very believable police officer. Alan Rickman as Hans Gruber steals every scene he's in. He is one of, if not the greatest action movie villain of all time. Holly Gennaro McClane is played by Bonnie Bedelia and she's very good in the film. Reginald VelJohnson plays Sgt. AL Powell, an LAPD officer who communicates with McClane through the use of a radio. He's great character with a great ark. Paul Gleason is Deputy Police Chief Dwayne T. Robinson and he's quite good as well. William Atherton plays a news reporter named Richard Thornburg who's a total tool. Hart Bochner plays Ellis. He's great in the movie. James Shigeta is Mr Takagi the owner of the nakatomi plaza. Karl is played by Alexander Godunov, who's very good. The limo driver named Argyle is played by De'voreaux White. He's a great supporting character.<br/><br/>This movie is perfect in every way possible, the acting, the directing, the amazing action, the cinematography by Jan de Bont, the dialogue, the setting, the editing, and the soundtrack are all perfect.

","In stepped John McTiernan and Bruce Willis with Die Hard. Willis, most famous at the time for the comic TV Series 'Moonlighting', made a perfect ordinary-man-in-an-extraordinary-situation action hero. He was believable as John McClane and not immune to being hurt. He bled and felt pain, a first for the genre. And yet his cool confident delivery of a great wisecracking, intelligent script made him all the cooler. But most credit should go to Director John McTiernan, king of the sophisticated action flick. He made action movies slick, smart and full of pace and wit while never letting up on the bullets, cars and bombs front. <br/><br/>Special praise must go out to Alan Rickman too whose performance as chief baddie Hans is to this day one of cinemas finest, moving convincingly from cool, calm and collected to desperate and nervous, never once seeming anything less than utterly ruthless and calculating. Even after we discover that Hans isn't there as a political terrorist but simply as a thief, he loses absolutely no villain credibility when he responds to Holly McClane's criticism by saying ""I am an exceptional thief, Mrs. McClane and since I'm moving to kidnapping you should be more polite."" Although we know Hans is capable of vile acts, he actually sees those as merely means to a greater and somehow justifiable end. His disposition is almost humanitarian and you would imagine him as quite a gentleman outside of the context of the crimes he commits in Die Hard's arc. In the end though, Hans is a pure sociopath that even the audience is conned into sympathizing with. I would actually argue that Die Hard is the greatest pure action film ever made. Yippie-ki-yay *muddy funster*... and happy holidays.<br/><br/>Overall rating: 9 out of 10."
"Screen_Blitz","9","3","3","3 December 2015"," Influential and revolutionary action movie that redefined its genre
","In the late 1980s, Director John McTiernan refined the action film genre with this action- packed thriller that not only stars Bruce Willis is the role that defined his career, but also brought impressed audiences everywhere with ecstatic action sequences complete with amazing practical effects, inspiring characters, and one of the most original scripts for an action movie written for its time. This movie stars Bruce Willis as John McClane, a New York cop who heads on vacation to Los Angeles for the holidays, to spend Christmas with his wife Holly Genero (played by Bonnie Bedelia) and kids. Upon arriving at the Nakatomi Plaza building where she works, he and his wife ended having an argument dealing with family matters. Their dispute is eventually interrupted when the building becomes under attack by a dozen German terrorists lead by the ruthless Hans Gruber (played by Alan Rickman) who's intent on robbing the company of its money. Pitted against overwhelming odds and Gruber's diabolical mind, John McClane must take matters into his own hands and fight off the terrorists who have his wife, along with hundreds of innocent civilians held hostage, with no aid from the Los Angeles Police Department who are helpless against the terrorists' overwhelming power.<br/><br/>My family and I catch this fi on cable almost every year during the Christmas season and this never gets old. Unlike other action films from the 80s that spit cheesy little one-liners and mindless gun shootouts, this film presents viewers with a very likable protagonist who is self aware with his flaws and has feels very human, a Villain who is near equally likable and incredibly smart, and the dialogue between these two characters (which are spoken via walkie-talkies for the majority of the time) is very witty and clever that keep viewers' attention. The main character John McClane spends most of the time fighting off the terrorists who are lead by Hans Gruber, and the scenes are exciting to watch. Glossing with intense gunfights, explosions, stellar camera-work and fight choreography, the scenes keep viewers strapped to their seats. In the scenes when the action lightens up, there are some interesting conversations between characters like McClane, who at one point, shares a tender moment with a cop by admitting his flaws as a husband and a man as a whole. These moments are make you feel for the character and are presented in a realistic way and not sappy way. Bruce Willis does an excellent job as the main character and his performances him as the action hero he is today, along with his famous line ""Yippie Kay Yay, motherf***er"". The same can be said about Alan Rickman is gives off a performances as the one of the most charismatic antagonists ever put on screen. What really impresses me about this film is the action set pieces. The Nakatomi Plaza that serves as the film's main setting (at least during the beginning) is shot nowhere other than Twentieth Century Fox headquarters. Quite interesting!<br/><br/>Die Hard is one of the most influential action films ever made and shines with nearly every aspect an action film needs. It is a good movie for viewers to pop a bag of popcorn, sit on the couch, and watch. Director John McTiernan did a fantastic job with this film as well as the cast. This film is a textbook example of what action films need to be and a movie that every action fan should not miss."

Well, it is set in the run up to Xmas and there are Xmas trees and Xmas parties in full swing, not to mention the obligatory renditions of ""Let it snow, let is snow, let it snow"". However, my idea of a Xmas movie is something that the whole family can sit down to and feel all warm inside! This film is not for the faint hearted and its amazing how this film still feels so contemporary when watching in 2015 when you realise it was made in the late 80's. Bruce Willis was finishing his comedy role in Moonlighting when he starred in this and was the casting director's final choice behind Arnie who turned the role down. What a stroke of luck for Bruce. You have to admire his acting in this film and I couldn't help but think how he is so much better an actor than someone like Keanu Reeves who is so wooden in comparison. Great plot, great characters and I loved the fact the FBI guys were made to look like idiots. Interesting to learn that in Germany, the bad guys were made to be British! Well, that's what you get for casting a British actor, Alan Rickman, to play a German terrorist. Love this film, always worth a repeat watch :-)"
"peterp-450-298716","9","3","3","9 September 2015"," THE best action flick ever !
","""Nine million terrorists in the world and I gotta kill one with feet smaller than my sister."" <br/><br/>Well, what else can I say besides that this is ""THE"" (can't stress it more) action movie from the 80's with a young Bruce Willis. Personally, I don't even know how many times I've seen this movie. ""Die Hard"" remains an example for all action movies that followed. At that time you had the Sly and Arnie action movies. But these were more a performance of brutal violence, with big muscles and a sense of invincibility. Bruce showed a clever, shrewd, caustic action hero, who can take a beating, but on the other hand shows that he's not completely invincible.<br/><br/>Of course, the action in films nowadays is much bigger, more impressive and mind-blowing, but the strength of this film is the story, the accumulated tension, lightness and the dry humor of Bruce Willis. From the first minute he takes you in his grip, and he won't let loose. You see him slowly evolve from a wrinkle-free clean-shaved top cop into a reasonable damaged hero. This pattern keeps coming back in the next two parts, which are also top movies of the same caliber.<br/><br/>You'll notice this is already an old movie because for instance lighting a cigarette in a public place isn't prohibited. But how the action scenes are imaged, is still top-work and should be the aim for many action flicks.<br/><br/>I think the sudden confrontation between Gruber and McClane is one of the strongest scenes in this film, along with the well known ""Yippie-kay-yee"" cry. Trademark of Willis. The fact he likes the character of McClane a lot, you see clearly in ""The Last boyscout"". In that movie he plays an impoverished detective with the same coolness and cynical, dry humor as McClane. Too bad that in the last two Die Hard movies, McClane is only a shadow of himself like in the original movie.<br/><br/>""Die Hard"" is one of those rarities in movie land, which you can watch without thinking ""Pfft Again this movie"". It remains, for me, an enjoyment to watch.<br/><br/>More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT"
"carter-47153","9","3","3","24 August 2015"," A Genre Defining Film
","In the 1980s, a unique trend developed in American Cinema. It became popular for one man to go against a larger superior force and emerge triumphant. Die Hard if not the progenitor of this genre, it most certainly stands as the prototype. It helped to establish what is possible for the emerging action genre when done right.<br/><br/>This film also established the career of Bruce Willis. At the time, he was considered a major risk. He had not had any significant ""breaks"" into film and had an average television career. Through his performance he became a household name and would be propelled into stardom. Mr. Willis was able to capture the ""everyman"" struggling through his life and never giving up.<br/><br/>Die Hard also introduced to the world the character actor, Alan Rickman. An actor whose speaking voice comes across solemn and droll. His voice was perfect for conveying the arrogance of Hans Gruber, the film's antagonist. He also has a chance to put his voice talents to use as he is required to use two different accents for the role.<br/><br/>The film follows a New York policeman, John McClain (Bruce Willis) who finds himself in the wrong place at the wrong time when a group of German terrorists led by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) take control of a skyscraper. The film does a good job of balancing action with McClain's physical and emotional suffering. Over time it has held up as an iconic film of the decade as well as within it's own genre."
"sandnair87","9","3","3","22 April 2015"," A Seminal Action Film for 'Die-Hard' Genre Fans!
","Die Hard is an action picture with a capital 'A'. In fact, you might as well go ahead and capitalize the whole darn word. It's an expertly constructed machine for mayhem - a relentlessly thrilling, masterfully executed action film that turns up all the knobs and sets the standard for all of the American films made in the genre.<br/><br/>To begin with, it's the classic plot hook of one man against many, right against wrong - a sweaty, bare-chested, all-American hero who battles a band of swarthy, heavily accented terrorist villains. But Die Hard is more layered than your average action movie. It is Christmas Eve. John McClane (Bruce Willis), a New York cop, is in town to spend the holidays with his kids and to fashion a reconciliation with his estranged wife Holly, who works for the Los Angeles branch of Nakatomi Corporation. Planning a rather different holiday agenda are the terrorists led by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman). The dastardly dozen invade the plush 30th floor offices of Nakatomi during its Christmas party, and hold the employees hostage as a computer whiz cracks a code that will put our bad guys in possession of $600 million in negotiable bonds. McClane's in the john when the bad guys arrive, and he manages to slip away into the bowels of the building with nothing but his handgun, where he becomes the fly in the ointment of the criminals' plans. As the FBI helplessly marshals its forces outside, it's up to McClane to carry on the battle from within. McClane must scrap his way through the mêlée, free the hostages, and in the process repair his troubled marriage. Shirtless and barefoot, McClane swings through elevator shafts, clambers up heating ducts and creeps across rooftops as he tries to pick off the bad guys one by one. <br/><br/>There's something satisfyingly claustrophobic about the premise, and the movie makers fully realize it's potential. Director John McTiernan works here with a clever script that offers ample opportunity for violence that is mind-boggling without being mindless. He composes the action cleanly and logically allowing the proceedings to acquire a sense of scale that can't help but impress. The film always looks gorgeous, and it never stops being exhilarating.<br/><br/>At the center of this whirlwind of a movie is Bruce Willis, who blends the vulnerability - normally unseen in action film heroes - deftly with the requisite superhuman feats. He almost burns the screen with his overwhelming charisma, his wicked sense of humor and his big-balled bravado. He ensures McClane remains human and relatable, even as the bodies pile up around him. The rogues in the movie pitch in equally commendable performances, particularly Alan Rickman. Smarmy yet charismatic, Rickman adds a theatrical flourish to his performance which only makes him more menacing. <br/><br/>Sleekly engineered, impeccably staged and shrewdly dosed with humor and sentiment, Die Hard manages to be heart-pounding and teeth- gritting every single time. Yippy-Ki-Yay!"
"antagonist117","9","3","3","31 January 2015"," Heart and the ability to surprise make ""Die Hard"" a gem among action movies
","The very best action movies are the ones in which the heroes are like us. As fun as a good James Bond movie can be, his been-there, done- that demeanor can't help but put a low ceiling on the stakes. But when the star is more or less an average person swept into a crisis unwilling and unprepared, there is a sense, however artificial, that anything might happen. There is also the possibility that the character will exhibit real emotional range. Deep into ""Die Hard,"" after Bruce Willis's John McClane has wasted over half a dozen terrorists and proved himself a master of gunplay, explosives, and witty repartee many times over, his voice still cracks with fear and heartache. That humanity, buried only shallowly below the swagger and the caked blood (lots of blood), is no small part of the movie's successful formula.<br/><br/>Another is its ability to create surprises between the inevitable moments that define the genre. The fact that bad guys waste their advantage over McClane by toying with him instead of shooting him outright, and that he uses each such reprieve to regain the upper hand, is a given. But there are several situations that seem entirely fresh. Alan Rickman's criminal mastermind, a man of ambiguous motivations, mercurial identity, and palpable confidence, finds himself unexpectedly in McClane's hands. Because the movie has been so carefully plotted and has kept McClane largely isolated from friends and foes alike, this is the first time the two stars have come face to face. We know the bad guy recognizes McClane, but we do not know what McClane knows. The movie seems to move in slow motion for several moments as this inventive situation plays out.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is a veritable parade of cynical expectations and pleasant subversions thereof. Two seemingly expendable black characters, a chauffeur and a cop, show up early in the movie. The cop, Al (Reginald VelJohnson), even mentions a pregnant wife. We've heard this kind of thing before; in a more typical movie, one or both of them would bite the bullet as a way to create quick pathos. But just when they seem to be on the cusp of ignoble sacrifice or of missing the chance to call for backup, leaving McClane alone and outnumbered for maximum heroism, things get interesting instead. The chauffeur hunkers down in the garage for a long while before coming back into play in a modest way, but Al dodges certain death to become McClane's partner-at-large. ""Die Hard"" is not normally remembered as a buddy cop movie, but in large measure it is. The dynamic that ""Lethal Weapon"" defined plays out almost to a tee as the Al and McClane bond over their wives and their careers. The homoerotic dimension of the genre is present, too; McClane and Al's hug at the end is even more emotionally charged than McClane and his wife's. After that, the trope of the bad guy coming back for one last shot happens exactly as it does in Mel Gibson and Danny Glover's earlier film, which like ""Die Hard"" takes place during Christmas. But ""Die Hard,"" not to be outdone, finds yet a third emotional beat to finish on. McClane's wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) is a strong and central figure throughout the movie, which makes a socially-conscious statement about women in the workplace and never places her in sexualized peril. Appropriately but still surprisingly, it is Holly who gets the final word. Also appropriately, she delivers it with her fist.<br/><br/>Not everything about the film is as brilliantly-conceived as McClane's explosive romp through the Nakatomi Plaza or his vulnerable, equitable relationships with his wife and his colleague. The movie continues an action movie legacy of paranoia established at least as long ago as ""Dirty Harry."" The press and law enforcement bureaucracy are cast as self-interested bumblers, as dangerous in their way as the murderous criminals. It's not an unreasonable position to take, but it's unreasonable to think that a hostage negotiator would be as distracted and preening as Paul Gleason's character, or that an FBI big-shot would be as evidently unstable as Robert Davi's. The casting is right, and these skilled actors' shifty faces could have spoken for themselves without so much on-the-nose dialogue.<br/><br/>This, though, is a quibble. Too much about the movie works, too much is surprising, too many characters are likable and reasonably real, to conclude that ""Die Hard"" is anything less than one of the best action films ever made. I want to watch it again the minute the classical credit music ends, and that's a rare impulse for me irrespective of genre."

It pushed the boundaries of suspension of disbelief, but it never stepped over them. It gave us excellent baddies, a resourceful and admirable - though not perfect - goodie, some idiots (and one sound ally) on the outside, and a claustrophobic environment and solid scenario within which all the elements could play out.

","Review #2 of ""My Top Ten Favorite Movies"" Reviews <br/><br/>In 1988, when Die Hard came out, my parents and a family friend went to see it in New York City in a big theater. The movie was so crowded, they all did not even get to sit together. (And I don't even think it was opening weekend!) Take that into consideration for how big a movie this was back then and still is.<br/><br/>Die Hard is the best action movie, and probably my favorite movie, with a close second or tie with The Shawshank Redemption.<br/><br/>Die Hard combines well-executed action scenes with cheesy but iconic one-liners and a great main character. As sarcastic, profane, and messed up John McClane is, you have to find yourself rooting for him.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis, Alan Rickman, and Bonnie Bedelia, Reginald Veljohnson, and many others will have their acting skills defined by this movie forever. After all, it definitely gave a career boost to some, although Willis already had a nice acting resume on his plate. Nevertheless, it redefined the whole genre.<br/><br/>Action movies consist of a bunch of key elements that come together to form a coherent picture. (At least I hope it will be coherent, as some tend to fail at this process.) They combine action scenes (obviously), at least a couple one-liners, a car (there's always a car or some kind of vehicle), a villain, and usually an explosion or two. Or three. ;-) All of these elements and many more were all in Die Hard, and it kind of changed the genre for good. You will hear people say ""Oh, that movie is a Die Hard rip-off"", or ""That stunt was first made famous in Die Hard."" It's not that action movies didn't have these elements before Die Hard, it's just that Die Hard made them better and/or famous.<br/><br/>Die Hard will keep you on the edge of your seat, and is an extremely well-done picture that doesn't lag or slow down at all. It eases into the action in such a way that it feels natural and not forced or unnecessary.<br/><br/>HandHStudios Rating: 10/10"

","This is one of my favorite movies of all time. Bruce Willis is amazing as John McClane. Alan Rickman is perfect as the quintessential bad guy as Hans Gruber. These two characters facing off makes for a perfect mixture, adding in the roles of Holly Genero McClane (played by Bonnie Bedelia), Sgt. Al Powell (played by Reginald VelJohnson) and Karl (played by Alexander Godunov).<br/><br/>I watch this movie at least once a year because, even though it was released 25 years ago, it is a classic. This is the one that started the Die Hard franchise. And has continued to be built on since the franchise is now up to five movies.<br/><br/>The movie is fairly slow until Gruber and his cohorts take the 40 story Nakatomi tower and everyone inside hostage. This includes John McClane and his estranged wife, Holly; John is a NYPD detective on vacation visiting his wife and children for Christmas. When Gruber and company take charge John is thrust into saving the day and taking out the terrorists. Amazingly, he does this all while barefoot.<br/><br/>This movie made Bruce Willis's career. Without this movie in his portfolio there is no telling where he would be today. On the other hand, without Bruce Willis there is no telling how successful the Die Hard franchise would have been. Alan Rickman also made the perfect bad guy, and there is no telling how well this movie would have done with someone else in that role."

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning<br/><br/>As Christmas Eve looms in Los Angeles, New York detective John McClaine (Bruce Willis) arrives to meet his estranged wife Holly (Bonnie Bedilia) at the Nakatomi Plaza. All is going smoothly enough, until a group of terrorists lead by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) seize control of the building and take everyone inside hostage-all except McClaine, who takes the terrorists on at their own game, in a deadly duel to the death.<br/><br/>The 80's was the decade where the last of the great big ideas were brewing, where the studios thought big and delivered bigger, where concepts became franchises and true artistic integrity became a distinct after thought. That's not to say most of the ideas weren't truly inspired, and didn't have the potential to become big investments. Trouble is, the last year in that decade is now very nearly twenty five years ago, leaving the time period itself very much as a thing of the ages. But it is now twenty five years since Die Hard burst on to the scene, and to it's credit, is still hailed by many after all that time as the definitive action film which set the standard by which all others are measured and of which countless imitations have been made. If nothing else, watching it again will wash the memory of that Godawful new film released earlier this year out your mind and remind you of the joyful, exhilarating spectacle that inspired the series in the first place.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis made his name with this role, making it all his own and putting his stamp all over it as the cynical, gnarly detective who proves a one man battle machine for the villains he's engaged with. The massive appeal here is almost certainly his presence as an every-man the average, predominantly male action fan could probably relate to, having been force-fed the impossible image through-out the 80's of the muscle bound, mumbling killing machine they could never live up to. McClaine is totally believable as a resourceful but bewildered man of the law thrown in to a situation he wasn't expecting, while Rickman as his adversary is restrained, jovial but also utterly cold and ruthless, determined to see his plan through to the end. Between them, they are a brilliantly twisted double act.<br/><br/>Some ideas are so good, and are executed so faultlessly, they deserve to become profitable institutions, spinning off with other versions and sequels, being imitated many times and still holding a special place in everyone's heart twenty five years on. Die Hard is full of explosive, exciting action, is brilliantly written, with great characters, fine dialogue and even finer set pieces. And all that aside, it's just great fun. It's success really speaks for itself. *****"
"Mr_PCM","9","3","3","25 March 2013"," The action movie that defined a generation - and spawned a thousand imitations!
","Die Hard is regularly ranked as the greatest of all the 80s action movies, and among the greatest of all time, and even 25 years later, it is not difficult to see why. Die Hard really is action film-making at its best, and began a new type of actioner - the everyman caught in a unique situation - that many films would try to copy; some more successfully than others, but none would ever measure up to the original. That even includes the 4 (and counting) sequels! It would launch the careers of Bruce Willis and Alan Rickman skyward - admittedly on different trajectories - and even become a bizarrely popular choice for a seasonal festive film each December! John McClane (Willis) is a New York cop who has travelled to Los Angeles to reunite with his estranged wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) at a Christmas party in a city skyscraper, when an armed band of villains march in with machine guns and take over, led by Alan Rickman's evil Hans Gruber, holding the partygoers to ransom. McClane must then work his way through the building, picking off the terrorists one by one, fighting a one-man war while the LAPD pontificates impotently on the doorstep.<br/><br/>The recipe is incredibly simple, yet brilliantly effective; the ludicrous situation is tempered by the Regular Joe nature of Willis's character, allowing the audience to identify wholeheartedly with his efforts and motivations, while hissing at the Machiavellian machinations of arch-criminal Gruber. The action itself is replete with some superb and exciting shootouts, spectacular set pieces and a new level of violence not often seen in such a mainstream action film before now - just watch for the scene with the broken glass, and you'll be wincing for weeks! Bruce Willis so perfectly captured the essence of his character, that the image, hair and even name have become synonymous with action heroes for all movies hereafter. The iconic shaved head and dirty white vest perfectly captured the feel of the right man caught in the wrong place at the wrong time, but it was not just Willis's physique and wardrobe that made John McClane such a hero. His fight scenes are brutally brilliant, and his delivery of both threats and sarcastic one-liners will have audiences punching the air and chuckling in equal measure. His radio exchanges with Rickman's Gruber are superb, and his charming banter with Sgt Al Powell on the outside - also over radio - lend the character an extra warmth that could easily have been missed, which would have made the character slightly less sympathetic.<br/><br/>But every great hero needs a villain, and Alan Rickman produced a performance of a lifetime; one which would lead him to being pigeonholed as a great British 'character actor' - Hollywood code for 'plays great villains!'. Admittedly this would lead him to even further success, most notably as the Sheriff of Nottingham in Robin Hood Prince of Thieves, and of course Professor Snape in the Harry Potter films, but it was unquestionably this role that set him on the role to a reputation as one of the greatest villainous actors of the twentieth century. His performance is never overstated, and without resorting to scenery-chewing, makes every single line positively drip with threat and menace. But he is also allowed a few light moments of his own in between his shooting of innocent bystanders - darkly comic interplay with the FBI outside in particular. His arrogant dismissive nature of the FBI while reeling off a list of names the group want freed is particularly black - his request for one group that he then mouths to his associate that he 'read about them in Time Magazine' a standout. His ability to produce a villain who is both positively loathsome and yet darkly charismatic makes Die Hard just as much Rickman's film as it does Bruce Willis's. Jeremy Irons' attempt to reproduce this balance in the film's third entry pales in comparison, producing a villain that is fun, but unfortunately occasionally too camp to be truly hissable.<br/><br/>The majority of the other characters are generally rather 2-dimensional, in particular McLane's estranged wife Holly, whose character is unfortunately lacking much in the way of back-story that could have made Willis's mission even more effective, whilst the henchman are as typically anonymous as you might expect from such an actioner. The rest of the attendees at the party are also mostly anonymous, making it difficult for the audience to truly get invested in their fate.<br/><br/>But such quibbles are unquestionably minor next to the brilliance of the whole, and such was the film's success that virtually every action film of its type would thus be labelled as the 'new Die Hard' or the even more derivative 'Die Hard on a plane/train/boat/submarine' (delete as applicable). So to see how films like Die Hard actioners should be done, it can only be Die Hard itself. A true era-defining film, one that even gained numerous name-checks in 'Friends' to demonstrate its iconic nature, that became a perfect template for all subsequent action films to follow."

"Torgo_Approves","9","3","3","24 August 2006"," Superb cast, brilliant action!
","(r#56)<br/><br/>This was an exhilarating movie that anyone should be able to enjoy. Bruce Willis shines in his breakthrough role as John McClane, the wise-cracking hard-ass cop. Willis, although a rookie actor, handles his shamelessly bad-ass one-liners as well as his dramatic scenes very well and never feels unbelievable. Alan Rickman almost steals the show from Bruce himself as the ultimate German villain, Hans Gruber. Rickman is a fantastic actor and it makes me sad to see him sleepwalking through The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and the Harry Potter series when he should be focusing on finding a good script instead. We need more movies like Galaxy Quest and Die Hard from him.<br/><br/>John McTiernan creates a perfect balance between the smashing action sequences, the character development and the humour, and as a result, Die Hard is one of very few movies that can be called ""perfect"" blockbusters. McTiernan had previously directed the Arnold classic Predator, but in my opinion Die Hard blows its predecessor out of the water in terms of pure awesomeness. The script is shock full of memorable lines that seem to have been written for Willis. The tension is thick throughout, but the comedy (mainly provided by McClane's one-liners, but also by a pathetically incompetent police deputy and an ignorant newsreader) never feels out of place or forced. It is perfection on all levels, and I wish that I could've been born in the late seventies just so I could've seen this film in the theatre. <br/><br/>I don't think any fan of action could dislike Die Hard, and neither would most fans of movies in general. It is a great thrill-ride from start to finish and features some of the greatest one-lines in history. It's just plain awesome even 18 years after its release. See it."
"Stampsfightclub","9","3","3","17 August 2006"," It's conventional but we still love it
","In many people's minds the term 'action thriller' is defined as predictable, over exaggerated and boring.<br/><br/>I tend to agree the majority of the time, especially after watching films like 'Mission impossible II' and 'James Bond' where the predictability was as present as Bond's sarcasm, ridiculously predictable and unrealistic.<br/><br/>Thankfully director John McTiernan was able to add a likable quality to the genre Bruce Willis stars in this 1988 smash hit action thriller which does contain a lot of typical action thriller conventions but why do we criticise? We see him running around Nakatomi towers and with his cheeky attitude and delivering cheesy but hilarious quotes, I found myself appreciating the character and the genre.<br/><br/>What was predictable was having many gun scenes which were unrealistic but that is always expected of this genre. Thankfully Die Hard doesn't reach to the extremes as MI2 does and the majority of gun fights and character action codes are believable but ARE enjoyable. Viewers are able to associate with the central protagonist John McClane who is sarcy and purely likable, I found it impossible to hate him. The bad mouthed cop is always on the move and willing to conform to the ideologies which director John McTiernan set, and are pulled off beautifully.<br/><br/>Alan Rickman is astonishing as the head terrorist Hans Gruber. His evilness is forever present as he controls the role beautiful with his established role and his cheekiness is great to, a more established and influential villain than some bond villains such as Elliot Carver in 'Tomorrow never dies'.<br/><br/>The partnership of Rickman and Willis was great. Having two contrasting characters worked wonders as the two bring their own beliefs to the story and viewers can appreciate these different beliefs by characters who are very interesting to observe.<br/><br/>The story is fast flowing and kept me on the edge of my seat for the full two hours. A fast placed plot with typical action conventions was crafted magnificently and appreciates the genre by using gun fights, stereotypes of villains, cops, the FBI etc to great effect. It is what many would expect but the humour, emotion and action ideologies are well crafted together, conveying an enjoyable action film.<br/><br/>Question marks hover over the beginning and the ending. The beginning is slow and may appear uninteresting and the ending is very over-exaggerated like many of the action scenes but I can't help but like it.<br/><br/>Having the film set in one setting, Nakatomi towers, was vital to the films success because being in a claustrophobic area allows the central protagonist's opinions to be limited, viewers are inclined to know how he is going to solve the problems with only a few options.<br/><br/>It is a very captivating film with the acting by everyone influential. The conventions of action are present but are more enjoyable than others because of the humour used.<br/><br/>Anyone with a strong gut and a thirst for riveting action scenes and dry sarcastic humour, believe me, you will love it."
"MovieReporter","9","3","3","2 May 2005"," Terrific
","Bruce Willis steps into the role that made him a Hollywood star - vest-strapped, wise-cracking New York cop John McLane who finds himself fighting off a herd of terrorists in an LA skyscraper after arriving at his wife's Christmas party. A superior action film on every level, Die Hard oozes quality in every department - John McTieran directs the whole thing with remarkable aplomb and skill, the script is perfectly balanced between suspense and humour and Willis - love him or hate him - gives a terrific performance. Far more than a hollow 80's shoot-em-up, Die Hard is an artistically and technically dazzling film that serves as gripping and great entertainment from start to finish. The best of the series? I think so."
"nogsy11","10","3","3","23 April 2005"," Non-stop Action
","Die Hard stars Bruce Willis who is a pretty much an unknown making only two low budget films before this one. He plays John McClane an seemingly unkillable loud mouthed New York cop who goes to Los Angeles to visit his family for Christmas. He first makes a stop at his wife's business a 40 story building in downtown L.A. The building is taken over by a group of German terrorists led by Alan Rickman making his silver screen debut. The action is incredible and Bruce Willis is beat up so bad its surprising he doesn't bleed to death.<br/><br/>Like every movie there are weaknesses the most notable one is Alan Rickmans German accent which is not very convincing. Another is the amount of times Willis gets punched in the face by the huge German without really falling down. But weaknesses are over shadowed by the explosive action and the entertaining performance by Bruce Willis. This and Terminator are the best action films of the 80's."

","""Die Hard"" is quite simply brilliant. It has a feel of ""rightness"" about it. It has the right plot, the right cast, the right script, and above all the right mixture of action and wise-cracking one-liners. The idea of having terrorists take hostages in a 30 storey building was a passageway for Bruce Willis to play the part he was born for. He is on top form here, in, personally, still his best film. He delivers the superb one-liners to perfection and ""yippie-kai-yay"" is famous world-wide. The action scenes suit Willis down to the bone. Also, Alan Rickman flawlessly plays the baddie. He made his character believable (and the German accent wasn't that bad). I would definately recommend this to anyone. Even people who don't like action films must be hard pressed not to be won over by the charisma and downright coolness of John Mclane. Die Hard rules."
"DarthBill","10","3","3","9 April 2004"," ""Is the building on fire?""
","No doubt about it, to a lot of people, Bruce Willis will ALWAYS be John McClane, for better or worse.<br/><br/>In the film that made him a star, or at least got him out of TV work, Bruce Willis is New York native cop John McClane, come down to LA to see his estranged wife and family for the Christmas holiday. Then Hans (Alan Rickman, in one of his best evil performances) and a group of thieves posing as terrorists who look European male models and an obnoxious black computer hacker show up, take over the building and try to rob the place. Only McClane can stop them, and his only real support comes from Sgt. Al Powell (played by the dad from TV's ""Family Matters""). Calamity, chaos and mayhem ensue as McClane and the foreign thugs tear the building apart trying to kill each other in the ultimate battle of all American cowboy hero and sophisticated Eurotrash and the idiot cops and FBI gets trip over themselves to help out.<br/><br/>Based on the novel by Roderick Thorpe. Bonnie Bedelia is Bruce's wife, and the late Alexander Godunov is Karl, who's vendetta with Bruce turns personal. Bonnie does well as the sympathetic wife with a bad haircut and Godunov, in a role very different from his debut part as an Amish farmer in ""Witness"", is surprisingly menacing in spite of his pretty boy looks. Of course, it helps that his career as a ballet dancer gave him more dexterity than the usual hulking henchman. His knock-down-drag-out brawl with Willis is one of the best.<br/><br/>Alan Rickman commented that he didn't view Hans as ""the villain"", but more as a guy who ""has made certain choices in life, wants certain things in life and goes after them."" All the same, Alan is the perfect villain for Bruce's wise cracking McClane, who is neither weak nor super human. Bruce worked very hard on this film and allegedly did a lot of his own stunts and really brought a lot of life and warmth to a character who could very easily have been just another grim loner. It's a shame that he's had to spend the majority of his career trying to get away from this character (kind of like Sean Connery trying to live down his glory days as James Bond). And to think that Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone, Burt Reynolds and Richard Gere all turned this part down (probably better that they did).<br/><br/>
Sadly, the appeal of the McClane character was lost in #3 ""Die Hard: With A Vengeance"", where McClane HAD become a grim, burned out, wasted loner.<br/><br/>
A big part of the power of ""Die Hard"" is that there are no easy escapes, very few places to run and very little ""cheating"" as director John McTiernan put it. And it's true that very few moments require you to suspend logical disbelief, although we do have to question if it's possible to successfully pull of the stunt where Bruce jumps off the building with a hose wrapped around him.<br/><br/>So grab the popcorn and get ready for the madness of ""Die Hard""! This is actually one of the few action films my family and I enjoy watching together. This was actually filmed at the 20th Century Fox Plaza."
"Meltdown53098533","Null","3","3","30 April 2003"," FABULOUS! All the action, thrills, suspense and dark humor that a person can handle without falling out of their seat!
","Until I saw Die Hard I heard rumors about it. ""magnificent"", ""best action movie ever"", ""unmissable"", ""often copied, never bettered"". And the weirdest thing was that I didn't believe those quotes. So, I rented it on video a few years prior, watched it, kicked myself, and watched it as many times as I could because I couldn't get enough of it!! Die Hard is one of the most eye popping action movies ever made in cinematic history. I personally think this IS the greatest action movie out there on the video shelves! PLOT. It's Christmas Eve. A New York cop named John McClane has just arrived in California to meet up with his wife. His wife Holly has a great career working for the Nacatomi Plasa, a highly successful buisness. Tonight the Nacatomi Plasa is celebrating it's most successful year with most of it's workers attending. Soon after John arrives, terrorists seize control of the 40 story building! Now John must use all his wits, abillities, and knowlege to save the lives of all the hostages, including his wife. This is nearly as good as it gets as the movie progresses with hair rising stunts, explosions and gunfights. Bruce Willis is a very apealing action star, with all his dark humor-ed one liners and moves. Alan Rickman plays the head terrorist with a lot of style and devilishly great charisma. The two of them play off each other terrificly. Packed with plot twist after plot twist, eye popping explosion after eye popping gun fight, and over all 100% thrills make this action-er stand out among the list of good action movies. Okay, some of the stunts would seem un realistic. But movie lovers of all kind, LET GO. loose yourself in this movie about a man fighting an uphill battle, with the odds of winning stacked against him. A man who doesn't know what he'll do next, a man who has no choice but to fight. A truely spectacular movie that is to NOT be missed by an action fan of any kind. 9.6/10.

His antics and what he has to do stretches credibility to the limit. Too much violence, too much shooting, killing and so on. I stuck with it only because I thought it couldn't get worse but it did, leaving me with the ultimate question: WHY?  Is this what audiences are thirsting for? Sorry.

","Die Hard is a Christmas movie directed by John McTiernan that's not traditional at all, but still watched each year during the holidays. Die Hard serves as an alternated holiday movie. Die Hard opens up with off duty New York Police Officer John McClane (Bruce Willis) attend a Christmas Party at Nakatomi Skyscrapper with his wife in downtown LA. Out of nowhere the plot kicks in the door as German terrorist and thieves take the people in the building hostage and start to make demands to the police. The group is led by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) a brutal man whom able to have casual persona and an an intimidating one in a few seconds. Hans also had a casual attitude to killing even willing to kill his own men. Alan Rickman is able to show that Han has a curt attitude to people whom he did not know and jokey nature with those he knew. Alan Rickman is able to make him out to be somewhat of a suit. He flaunted his knowledge and boast of his education to anybody, but McClane manage to slip from his grip. The film follows his exploits as he slowly engages the German terrorists one by one barefoot to retake the tower while dealing in depth of personal pain. The broken glass on his barefoot can be seen as his Achilles's heel. McClane lacks heroic virtues and qualities like Achilles. He can be explains to be a Byronic hero or Anti-Hero by having similar traits to those who like being arrogant and cynical. He is also cunning and able to adapt. He has a dis-tasted for social institutions and norms when he was at the party. John McClane works better alone than in a crowd. Die Hard gives their hero, a cutting edge from cookie cut heroes. What Die Hard does well is keeping a small scale budget while exporting a big blockbuster result. Most of the movie takes taking place entirely within a few floors of the Nakatomi Plaza. It was one of the first of the limited-space, small cast action films. This formula of putting characters in limited area spawn great sequels in their own right, but also an entirely new sub-division of the action genre. The movie is condensed in a few scenes and areas that get so well know. It simplified in such a way that lets the characters and the action really develop and shine through. While having a few explosion-filled sequences, the movie allows the audience to care for the characters and not feel like disconnected from the story-arch or the depth of the characters portray. The movie takes light-hearted approach to the genre, incorporating many less-than-serious elements and one-liners keeps the movie fun and enjoyable no matter how many times watched through, but it comes with a cost. Sub-characters in the film seem corny, low-intelligent or bad written. The scenes with the LA police for example drag the movie down and slow it down. The film brings in Reginald Vel Johnson playing a role as a cop which doomed the actor to playing cops for the rest of his life. He continues to be type cast to this day. Reginald Vel Johnson's character has a trouble past where he accidentally shot a kid and now wouldn't be able to shot. While they did give some back-story to Reginald Vel Johnson character, most of his lines were bad and his actions in the movie are nearly useless. All the main characters in this film are fairly complex and well written compared to most of the dumb action hero movies of the 1980s. Still the police chief doesn't serve any purpose except for delaying police intervention which would have wrapped the story up faster. Matters would have been more easily solved had the chief acquired an average intelligence. Since the sub-characters took a backseat, the character of McClane and Gruber makes the movie watchable. The sarcastic nature of McClane's character against the whimsical Gruber makes this hero and villain pairing one of the finest in film history. The movie even makes a famous quote out of its hero's swearing mouth that can be still heard today. The language can be harsh and the violence too much but it's a good movie. The plot might seem rudimentary and unoriginal today, but it still one of the first movie with many of the things action movie need to be a success. It's the blueprint to any action movie today."
"loccomotive2000","8","5","6","23 June 2007"," Never felt so energetic watching a film
","Bruce Willis stars as THE most bad-ass cop in film history even as of today: John McClane. The wise-cracking, tough-as-nails cop who's always sarcastically funny and never fears to get his hands dirty. This man is no Rambo though; he does not plan, relying solely on instinct and last-minute thinking, which although nearly got him killed quite a number of times, seemed to have worked well enough.<br/><br/>The plot was simple enough yet intriguing. McClane is pitted against 12 terrorists in a building, with no help from anywhere, in a battle of wits and grit against their leader, the diabolical Hans Gruber, excellently portrayed by Alan Rickman.<br/><br/>Die Hard is a remarkable success on every level; the jokes were funny, the gunfights were gory and we have two individuals consistently taunting each other to keep the temperatures rising. In my humble opinion, this was the herald of the transition of action movies moving into the 90s.<br/><br/>Yippee Ki-yay, mother*beep*."
"oneloveall","8","5","6","29 May 2007"," In the rare pantheon of outstanding Hollywood action movies
","Nearly twenty years and millions of clichés later, the original Die Hard still holds up in all of it's Hollywood glory. One of the last films to come out of that greater era of quality popcorn entertainment (compared to today's standards), this fluidly visceral, though lighthearted study into the hostage tensions overtaking 40-story Nakatomi plaza has become a modern day action classic for all the right reasons.<br/><br/>Sure some characters have devolved into caricature upon recent viewings (Hart Bochner's coked up Ellis), sure the entire mechanics informing this intense ordeal feel a little less gripping in retrospect, and sure an excess of one-liners can degrade the entire process on the whole...but not by a whole lot. Die Hard was perfectly calibrated to be as entertaining as it was bloody, adult, and exciting when it arrived. While time may have extracted a percentage of the urgency out of this eternally exciting experience, conceptually the original Die Hard will continue to remain one of the most captivating settings ever staged in a modern action film. The selfless direction from John McTiernan was hitting it's stride as he captured progressively intense battles in a simultaneously spacious and claustrophobic setting.<br/><br/>It is the triumphant locale which hosts this intelligent robbery thriller that will continue to beckon re-visitation, though without the considerable tension between our two leads, Nakatomi skyscraper would remain an empty gesture. Bruce Willis could not have asked for a better early career move then to star as New York cop John McClane. Even if it did pigeon-hole his limited talent, Willis already displayed the raw intuition that made him one of our most agreeable action stars. His everyman style was one of instant cult likability: a person most average joe's could relate to, thrust into a situation no one could relate to. His line deliveries will pale to the actor who has slightly but surely refined his craft over many years, but the finesse with which he eases into the action with believability and likability became instantly recognizable."

","a truly awesome action movie which should provide the outline for all Acton movies. surely no one dislikes this film? Surely? Well done Mr Mclaine for giving me many happy times pretending to be a kick ass cop as a kid while blowing away imaginary terrorists with my home made machine gun. Also nice visual effects for its time including the ""brains on the window"" scene. Fair enough the story line is not so original but who cares when an action film is this entertaining and that many people are killed in one night, inside one building by one man.

","Yup. That's the title I'm giving this short review. Nothing else comes to mind that would do it more justice. The time is 1988, a young Bruce Willis stars as Officer John McClane in an excellently built, explosive late 80's action classic that actually runs at about 2hrs10min but is a blast to watch. It's not perfect. It's got its flaws. But to hell with those, this is just too much fun to not be watched, and even if you're the intellectual kind, if you like cinema, check this out as it is a lesson on how to make a campy, action-filled thriller the right way. It's a bit long, and yeah the relationship with the black cop is a bit rushed during the ending scene... but the cunning intelligent villain is here, vs the anti-hero, guns, big explosions, the cops, the mischievous lines Willis delivers...this is fun man.

","Man, I'm watching Die Hard every single time and it doesn't fail to surprise me. Bruce Willis gives a lifetime performance as John McClane and the recently deceased Alan Rickman is simply fantastic as the main villain. What's so great about this movie is not the action, but the story itself, and the fact that McClane is outnumbered and it's unknown whether he'll win or lose. McClane's witty lines and his signature ""Yippee-ki-yay"" influence me to this day. This movie has a simple story: 12 terrorists take over the Nakatomi plaza and demand many things while keeping one secret. Unfortunately for them, there's the guy they didn't count on - NYPD Detective John McClane. The fact that the main villain doesn't know McClane's face and vice versa. See, this is yet another great thing about this film - (SPOILER ALERT) they will be meeting each other, and it won't be pretty. Thank you, John McTiernan, for making this movie. And may You Rest in Peace, Alan Rickman. Without you, this movie wouldn't be what it is today."
"Michael_Elliott","Null","4","5","27 January 2013"," Wham Bam Action Classic
","Die Hard (1988) <br/><br/>*** (out of 4)<br/><br/>Enjoyable and tense thriller about a group of terrorists (led by Alan Rickman) who overtake a L.A. skyscraper and the only thing keeping them from getting away with their crime is a New York police officer (Bruce Willis) there on vacation. There's a lot of very good things about this movie but I've always thought that the majority of the credit has to go to star Willis. He might not have been a A-list star at the time this was released but it's easy to see why he became one afterwards. I think what's so great about him and the character he plays is that we can believe he's just your typical guy you'd see walking around on the streets with you. That every-day-man quality that Willis has works so well here because of the odds stacked against his character you can't help but just sit back and enjoy this one person taking out a professional organization. The hilarious one-liners, the smart remarks and the way Willis makes himself know to the terrorists is just classic and we get so many great showdowns that you can't help enjoy all of them. It certainly doesn't hurt that you've got a strong supporting cast with Rickman being a villain you just love to hate. The coldness RIckman brings to the part is the perfect contrast to Willis' cop and it works perfectly. Reginald VelJohnson, William Atherton, Bonnie Bedelia and Paul Gleason also add great support for Willis to play off of. The action scenes are certainly some of the best you're going to see and what holds them together so well is the direction by John McTiernan. He perfectly blends the humor, tension and the action but he also gives the film a wonderful pace that keeps it moving at a fast rate. DIE HARD might be far-fetched in what one man is able to do but this really doesn't take away from any of the fun."
"fredericksmith1952","10","4","5","23 March 2012"," Dirty Harry with an attitude!
","Okay, so who am I to argue with success? Obviously this franchise has proved immensely popular, given the further proliferation of Die Hards 2, 3, & 4. John McClane is Willis' most popular character, and a natural extension of his role in the television series Moonlighting with Cybil Sheppard. McClane is a street cop, a no-nonsense, shoot first ask questions later police officer who apparently gets the job done in the style of Dirty Harry. Alan Rickman is exceptional as Hans Gruber, the ex-terrorist with aspirations of becoming wealthy no matter how many lives are lost. As in most McTiernan action films, there is little background or lead in, just enough to let you know who the players are, and the action quickly starts and barely pauses. Bonnie Bedelia is excellent in her role as Holly Gennero, the top executive with people skills and a sense for reasonable control. She is the perfect executive who thinks of her people first and attempts to maintain calm under duress. Alexander Godunov plays Karl, the hot-headed terrorist on a mission to kill McClane for killing his brother. While no one will ever consider the Die Hards as Oscar worthy films, they are fun and exciting, and definitely collectible. Rated R for some brief nudity, drug use, and a whole lot of gratuitous violence. Like Vin said in xXx, ""....think Playstation...Blow s*&t up!"""

","This was truly a ground breaking movie and that's saying a lot since it's an action movie which are usually just mindless fun big explosions going off kind of cinema. Not that there is anything wrong with that mind you.<br/><br/>But this is the first big action movie to where it wasn't about an army superman taking down the bad guys. It was about a regular everyday cop who while he also stops the bad guys does it in a fairly believable manner. No ridiculous stunts where you go ""yeah right""(that takes place in Live Free or Die Hard though).<br/><br/>Bruce Willis plays the cop character John McClane which took him from being a TV actor to being a movie star.

","No action movie has ever given the kind of thrill that Die Hard did when I watched on one Christmas Eve when I was 12 years old.<br/><br/>As the years have past, my opinions on the movie have escalated to gigantic proportions and I think that not only is it the most entertaining action movie of all time, but one of the most entertaining movies of any genre ever made!! Part of the reason has to do with the hero: Bruce Willis' John McClain is my favorite movie cop ever and, IMO, he probably will never be topped. He is very believable in the part and you root for him every second.<br/><br/>Another thing is Alan Rickman, who not only created one of the most vile and chilling villains in movie history, but gave a performance that should have won him the Oscar....but sadly, he was snubbed the entire award season.<br/><br/>The movie's script isn't perfect but it gets the job done and very well I might add....and John McTiernan does one heck of a job with the direction....possibly the best (or in the top 3 for me) when it comes to action movie directions.<br/><br/>I don't think you can really go wrong with Die Hard....it is a classic in every sense of the word and I love the film passionately!!"
"Lord_Crypto","10","4","5","22 June 2007"," Influenced me as a child
","Die Hard had a significant impact on me as a child. I would go to school in the fourth grade talking about how I wanted to hunt terrorists and smoke cigarettes just like John McClane. That is influence, right there! This film definitely takes the title of, ""Best Action Film of All Time!""<br/><br/>John McTiernan has created a pop culture icon with Die Hard. Everyone knows the film and for good reasons. As Homer Simpson once wrote...""Dear Die Hard, you rock! Especially when you were on the roof."" Die Hard is all about entertainment and it provides just that. Violence, humor, action, vulgarity; everything that a good man needs in a movie. There are so many things in this film that make it great! The roof sequence where McClane fights terrorists while being shot at by a helicopter. McClane's unique and varied different killings of the terrorists. And of course, the unforgettable quote, ""Yi-pi-ki-ya (apologizes for miss spellings), Mother F#C*ER!"" Die Hard has one goal, entertain! And there is never a moment of boredom in this film.<br/><br/>Although it succeeds in entertainment, acting is terrific in this movie. On the part of three main actors. First, is of course, Bruce Willis as John McClane. Second, is Alan Rickman as Hans Gruber. Rickman does such a good job as an uptight, stylish, and sophisticated Gruber who is also a sick and demented individual. The character is played perfectly. Third is Alexander Godunov as Karl. Maybe my favorite character in the film, Karl is the muscle man. Gruber's #1 guy! And after McClane kills his brother, Karl takes it personal. He is an incredibly dangerous and psychotic individual and I love him for it. These three actors are what make the film entertaining aside from the action.<br/><br/>Die Hard is the best action film of all time! Terminator, Lethal Weapon, Dirty Harry, Predator all need to move aside. This film has everything an action movie needs. As my friend always said about this film, ""If you don't like it, you don't have balls!"""
"somegravity","10","4","5","19 May 2007"," A classic action film
","To this date,Hollywood continues to produce and release several great action films. This is something that Hollywood has been great at for several decades. And,one of those films happens to be ""Die Hard"". Not only is ""Die Hard"" great as an action film,is a great part of film history that all action film fans,as well as film fans in general,do not want to miss out on.<br/><br/>Based off the 1979 novel ""Nothing Lasts Forever"" by the late Roderick Thorp (RIP),this film starts off with going into the life of John McClane (Bruce Willis). McClane,an off-duty New York City police officer,has the perfect Christmas holiday planned:he is going to spend the holiday out in Los Angeles,with his estranged wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia)and their two children,who Holly brought to LA with her after taking a promotion as a stock broker at LA's Nakatomi Building. Not only do John and Holly have a lot of great plans made for their Christmas holiday together,they also have the holiday as a strong opportunity to save their marriage from problems that they have been struggling with recently.<br/><br/>Then,before John and Holly McClane can have a nice Christmas together,a large amount of trouble arises. This is when a group of German terrorists,lead by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman)and his assistant Karl (Alexander Godunov)seize complete control of the Nakatomi building,while holding the rest of the Nakatomi employees who are left in the building hostage. The reason as to why this large group of terrorists have taken over the Nakatomi Building on Christmas Eve? A reason that is largely unknown to all of the hostages (including Holly). But,once John McClane has slipped away from the terrorists,the terrorists find their own plans changing,as well. This is due to John McClane not only launching a one-man war against the terrorists,but also bringing the LAPD in on the situation,which leads to several twists and turns in ""Die Hard"".<br/><br/>Not only does ""Die Hard"" provide all of the entertainment that one would want out of an action film,it also has a lot of great chemistry in it,as well. I won't give this away in hopes to not spoil the film,but the great chemistry that is used throughout ""Die Hard"" does a strong job at bringing several dramatic issues into this film. This is something that makes ""Die Hard"" more interesting and not just another ""bang,bang,bang,shoot 'em up"" action film. At the same time,the drama and chemistry in ""Die Hard"" make DH suspenseful and entertaining,while it leaves its viewers wondering what will happen next,as well. As for the performances,Bruce Willis is perfect as John McClane,and gives a very strong and tough performance as McClane,with a lot of emotion and intensity. And,besides Bruce Willis and Bonnie Bedelia working great alongside each other in ""Die Hard"" with the suspense and chemistry,it is also worth noting that Alan Rickman's performance as Hans Gruber is both suspenseful and chilling. All of this is what helps ""Die Hard"" fully come together,and make DH the good and successful film that it is.<br/><br/>Overall,if you have not seen ""Die Hard"" yet,what are you waiting for? 10/10"

","For my 100th review on IMDb.com, I have decided to go with my all-time favorite movie, ""Die Hard."" It is, in my mind, the greatest action movie ever made, and also one of the best movies ever made, period. Its only purpose is to entertain, and entertain it does, without a single dull moment from start to finish. It flies along at a lightning pace, the pyrotechnics and stunts are amazing, and the entire cast shines. McTiernan takes full advantage of the setting, and there is a genuine feeling of claustrophobia and heart-pounding suspense when McClane is sneaking around in the vents and elevator shafts.<br/><br/>Direction aside, even the script itself is cleverly written, with a lot of humor thrown in, and interesting, well-thought-out plot twists (such as McClane taking off his shoes in the beginning, only to seriously regret it later on). It was also a stroke of genius on the screenwriter's part to have it take place during Christmas, ensuring that it would become a perennial classic.<br/><br/>It has been criticized, of course, for being full of clichés, but the fact is, no other action movie has handled those clichés as well as this one. It set the standard for action movies, and since then very few have even come close. ""Die Hard"" is a nonstop thrill, and all in all the most wildly entertaining movie I have ever seen. 10/10 stars."

My mom was just absolutely in love with this film and told me how much I should see it if I love action movies, also I had become a Bruce Willis fan, so when she mentioned that, I decided to sit down and watch it. It's not just Bruce Willis that makes this movie, although he does a fantastic job as the ultimate hero, his line delivery is always perfectly on cue and he's just such a cool guy that anyone could love. But for me it was Alan Rickman who truly steals the film, he is the ultimate bad guy and his voice was just so creepy, I love him. But all together the cast and special effects truly make this a memorable film for generations to come.<br/><br/>John McClane is a police officer who has taken his career very seriously, a little too seriously since his wife is about to divorce him and he's about to loose his children. When John comes to see his wife, Holly, at her office building during the company Christmas party, he asks if he can be given a second chance, but that gets slightly interrupted when terrorists enter the building. Hans Gruber, the leader of the terrorists, wants 600 million dollars of bonds from the company's owner. But with John in the building, he's gonna have a hard time because John is on his case will make sure to give him a roller coaster of a crime bust.<br/><br/>This is without a doubt the most exciting action movie since The Terminator. I love the whole idea of this taking place around Christmas, it just adds a little more dark humor. Especially the way that Alan Rickman says ""Now I have a machine gun. Ho...Ho...Ho"", it was just so perfect! I really love Die Hard, I am officially a fan, this is just the most awesome movie to watch.

","This is one of the best action movies ever made and should be considered as a lesson in ""how to actually make a good action with lots of Bang Bang, without making fun of the audience."" The problem with most movies like this is either that you from the beginning know how it will end, or that it takes a unbelievable turn that makes you cry out in pain. Well, of course you know that the good guy will end up in victory even this time(spoiler?), but everything is so freaking well done. The action scenes is explosive and extremely well directed, and Alan Rickman as the bad (German)guy is so cool I actually sometimes hoped he would win.<br/><br/>I hear a lot that Bruce Willis is just another movie hero without any skills in acting but hey, the man can act. He may not be a Brando, but he knows how to do his job, and here he does it real good. I also think that the location of the story is very thrilling, a skyscraper where the characters plays hide and seek in the elevators and ventilators.<br/><br/>As a action movie I rank this as the best just above other classics as Face/Off, The Rock and The Untouchables. 5/5"

","Ahhh... There's nothing like the holiday season! Family reunions around the big table, presents for everybody and the kids playing all night long after Santa Claus' visit. Movies set in Christmas are always the kind of production which enhance our mood, touch us and make us feel better... Is it? <br/><br/>Not anymore. Because ""Die Hard"" is set exclusively on Christmas Eve, but it has nothing to do with Santa, elves or Frosty the Snowman. It simply is the catalyst of the blockbuster generation of the 90s and it's also one of the best action movies of all time.<br/><br/>The movie is about a group of European terrorists (they're German, actually) who plan to steal $600,000,000 from Nakatomi Plaza's vault, in Los Angeles. By the way, for those who didn't know it, the Nakatomi Plaza building is exactly the same than 20th Century Fox headquarters.<br/><br/>The group is led by Hans Gruber, one of the most interesting villains portrayed for a while and Alan Rickman's best role to date. What distinguishes Gruber from the other master criminals is his great intelligence, his apparently high level of education and erudition and his careful plotting of the heist. He always seems to know what he is doing, what he has to do, what is gonna happen and what to do if there is any hitch. He looks like a modern Phileas Fogg. This is almost scary, because we can ask ourselves: ""How could we beat this... machine?"" <br/><br/>Unfortunately for Gruber, there is only one little thing (and a considerable one) that he didn't count on: John McClane (the one and only Bruce Willis, in his breakthrough role). McClane is a NYPD cop who came to L.A. to visit his wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia), but he was able to escape himself from the terrorists when they invaded the building. Now, he's the only one able of defeating the terrorists and he's gonna have to use his brains, his guts and his muscles in order to stay alive and save everybody.<br/><br/>McClane is first depicted as a mildly-reclusive, word-avid cop, but he quickly becomes wild after the terrorists' takeover. And his heroic actions throughout the entire movie make him one of the coolest heroes of the last years, along with Indiana Jones and James Bond.<br/><br/>The action scenes are greatly orchestrated by action maestro John McTiernan (known at the time for ""Predator). Not only do they figure bloody battles, explosive gunfights and eye-popping pyrotechnic effects, but they're filmed in unique and interesting ways. Here are some examples: After Harry Ellis is shot, we can watch Gruber talking to the police via walkie-talkie... throughout holes made in Ellis' head. And there's also these scenes where McClane shoot two terrorists in the legs, making them literally blow out with blood.<br/><br/>Gunfights are unrelenting and we could believe that there were as many bullets shot in this film as in an entire war.<br/><br/>And for dessert, what about two great bombings inside the building itself? First, there is that unforgettable and visually-dazzling massive explosion made by McClane with a 'bomb chair' and, second, that epic roof bombing, which can be visible from the far other side of the city.<br/><br/>This is the great part of the visual. The less shining part is the light circles and ovals which constantly appear and disappear during nearly all the movie. This is very annoying and disturbing.<br/><br/>Other than Gruber and McClane, there are only two very interesting characters. The first one is Gruber's henchman Karl (Alexander Godunov). Just looking at him is dreadful. His eyes are aggressive, cold and piercing. And his indelible grimace render him menacing and serious. He's that kind of guy with whom it is preferable not to make angry.<br/><br/>The other interesting protagonist is Sgt. Powell (Reginald VelJohnson). He's the only contact that McClane has with the exterior from inside his glass pseudo-prison. Together, they develop a close relationship with each other during the operation although they never see each other until the end, in a very heart-warming scene.<br/><br/>""Die Hard"" wins points for what it is and for what is has become. In 1988, it showed a whole new kind of action sub-genre: the die-hard genre, which is an action picture taking place in a restrained place, such as a skyscraper, a plane and so on... The hero was a real human being, instead of being a reckless soldier, a suave spy or a martial-arts expert. It is a great example of the near-perfect action picture. It's ""Die Hard"" that launched a wave of big-budget action pictures, making the 90s what we could call the 'yippee-ki-yay' generation."

","""Die Hard"" is a 1988 action film directed by John McTiernan starring Bruce Willis and Alan Rickman. As the popular meme states, there are people who think this action classic is a Christmas movie and people who are wrong. Since its original release (as it was told me) this film has been the only choice for the perfect Christmas Eve in my family. A few years have passed since I joined this tradition and immediately fell in love with it - and even now it's the highlight of the day to me. It doesn't only enjoy cult status because people watch it during the most wonderful time of the year and feel great thanks to it, it's a cinematic masterpiece that's near perfect. With the beginning shots, the atmosphere begins to set in immediately. The best of it all are the plot and the screenplay: Not only are there iconic protagonists, each and every supporting character has a well designed personality and plays a major part in the story. Additionally, it's perfectly paced and keeps a packing tension every single second, mostly due to the extreme ingenuity of the writers. It might take place in a limited area, but still delivers a powerful and far-reaching experience. From bombastic and realistic explosions to intelligent shootouts, the film develops a scenario that never becomes boring. It offers enough variety and lives from its love for detail, thus enabling the viewer to dive in the situation completly. John McClane, the sarcastic anti hero is getting along perfectly with the calculated and cold antagonist Hans Gruber (brilliantly played by the late legend Alan Rickman). It's always a great joy to see how they fight each other verbally and in the end face to face. Thanks to outstanding editing and a ingenious sound score the buildup to the final showdown is always a treat for a perfectionst like me. In most instances it feels like a video game I'll never get the chance to play myself and that's always a sad realisation. All in all, this action film is the perfect film for Christmas Eve and ranks high up in the list of the best Christmas films of all time (only a certain Frank Capra film is better) and will always be a part of my tradition. It never gets bad or ages badly, even more than 30 years after it hit the big screen it's way better than most of the blockbusters of our modern cinema. Often copied but never reached, it will forever remain on the top spot of action films. To me, Christmas can only begin when I see Hans Gruber fall of the Nakatomi Plaza. Otherwise it's not Christmas."
"NightmareOnElmStreetFan","10","2","2","1 December 2019"," The best bad-ass macho action movie of the 80's extravaganza my personal favorite action movie of all time
","What can I say about Die Hard that was already said: it is one man army type against a team of terrorists who took over the building on Christmas Eve in L.A. I love this movie to death it is consider as a Christmas movie. It is my personal favorite action film of all time, that is dear to my heart. I have seen this movie over 100 times. Some people put Die Hard 2 over this movie, some people put Die Hard: With a Vengeance over this movie, I will never put any of the sequels above this movie because it is perfect. Die Hard is and will always be my favorite it is the best one in the action movies. Bruce Willis fits perfectly the role of John McClane a New York Cop, it was his first action movie that made him in to an action star.<br/><br/>Directed was by John McTiernan who directed Predator a year earlier, this movie is based on a novel Nothing Lasts Forever by Roderick Thorp. This movie suppose to be a sequel to Commando (1985) but Arnold Schwarzenegger declined the role thank god. Sylvester Stallone was consider it for the role and he declined. Richard Gere, Harrison Ford, Mel Gibson, Eastwood, Robert De Niro, Charles Bronson, Don Johnson, Richard Dean Anderson and Michael Madsen were considered, but declined the role of John McClane. Thank god Bruce Willis fit the role perfectlly.<br/><br/>This is the first and only movie that is about one man army type fighting against a team of terrorists who took over the building and declared war. There was a bunch of movies that copyied Die Hard but no movie could nealed like Die Hard did. Under Siege with Steven Seagal was my childhood film, I loved Seagal's character but now as an adult and from my teen years Die Hard surpass Under Siege because Die Hard was one man army type, who was in situation that felt realistic. Imagine your in a building and suddenly you hear gun shots, people with automatic weapons shooting at people and takes everyone hostage. What will you do? In this situation was John McClane armed only whith his service revolver barefoot he runs upstairs and all telphones dosen't work. McClane is alone, he crawles down the elevator shafts and try's to find out more information about the group. The only communiactions is trough radio.<br/><br/>A team of terrorist shuts down all exits and elvators so no one can go down or up. The leader of the group is Hans Gruber played by Alan Rickman it was actors first role. Hans Gruber is one of the best villians of all time. Ask anyone, or read anywhere they will all tell you that Hans Gruber is the best villiand and bad guy of all time. In actaully terrorists werent agenda for a political demands, they were planing a heist in a 30 floor to steal $640 million in bearer bonds hold in a building's vault and not let anyone go. I can't wrote detailes or I will get spoliers so I don't want any spoliers on my review. Sgt. Al Powell played by Reginald VelJohnson was my favorite characacter. I love how he defends McClane against his suprevisors. I love how McClane and Powell communicate eachother from cop to a cop on a radio I love that. I love Dwayne T. Robinson, the Deputy Chief of Police ""kick-ass!"" I love Paul Gleason who does everything by the book. He is sure McClane is one of the terrorists, I really do wish his character would had more to do. I love Diana James and Shelley Pogoda who are Dispatcher and Police supervisor when McClane calls them for help. Gail Wallens played by Mary Ellen Trainor I love her as news reporter.<br/><br/>The movie has tones of action: McClane talks to him self when he is about to do something crazy. my favorite scene is McClane firing 15 rounds with his Beretta 92F on a terrorist under the table. McClane grabs the fire hose, ties it around his body jumps with the helicopter about to kill him. Then Gruber blows it a second after McLane jumps off the roof! It was an incredible explosion that totally takes out the helicopter. But McLane is falling down the side of the building and needs to get inside quickly this is the best scene in the movie my favorite. McClane clambing down the elevator shaft is really one the best scens in the movie. Two terrorist uses Rocket Launcher and destroy a SWAT van that was driving in the building practical effect real explosion realy action done for real. The same van was used later in RoboCop 2 just that movie was less successful. You have 3 explosions in the building all done practical and for real. 20th Century Fox with the 80's really nailed with action movies nowdays the 20th Century Fox does not make so good movies like Predator, Die Hard, Aliens and Speed I miss action movies like this. The fight sequence between McClane and Karl was great choregraphed well filmed and done for real.<br/><br/>Great music score by Michael Kamen absolutelly love the music score. All the terrorists are great in this movie. Great lines: ""The man is hurting! He is alone, tired, and he hasn't seen diddly-squat from anybody down here. Now you're gonna stand there and tell me that he's gonna give a damn about what you do to him, *if* he makes it out of there alive? Why don't you wake up and smell what you shoveling?"" Great dialogue and lines in this movie.<br/><br/>Some guy meantion this movie on Lethal Weapon review that Lethal Weapon is his favorite film over Die Hard. I disagree this is my favorite film of all time Die Hard it is better than Lethal Weapon! Die Hard is a Christmas action movie one of the greatest movies of all time. I love this movie to death. It is my personal favorite action movie of all time.<br/><br/>It is the best bad-ass macho action movie of the 80's extravaganza with balls to the walls, my personal favorite action movie of all time."

","It's easy to forget those sparkling days of Hollywood when the likes of Arnie and Sylvester ruled the screen, machete in one hand and machine gun in the other. In this age of vampire slayers and plucky tomb raiders, the action hero has become something of a box office shadow. Let's look back in time, then, back to 1988 when a little film called Die Hard was released. Expectations were low for a film loaded with explosives and expletives. But then the cash began to flow.<br/><br/>If anybody is to be credited for Die Hard's success, it's Bruce Willis. In him we find the perfect action hero; fuelled by emotion, captivating and sharp-tongued, rippling with muscle. He is the everyman, and he is all man, bleeding, sweating, cursing. He is the epitome of cool, with his pithy one-liners (""Yippee Kai-Yay motherf*cker!"") and his finger on the trigger. Alan Rickman, Willis' polar opposite, brings a cold, calculating superiority to his villain. His lines are whispered with menace, just enough humour injected to escape hammy over-dramatics. Who cares if he set the precedent for growling English villains in Hollywood fare when he does it this well? This is a balls-to-the-walls crowd-pleaser, and every character has their moment. Bloody, outrageously extravagant action sequences are delivered with the same deadpan humour of Willis' performance, playfully underlined by Michael Kaman's seasonal score. Effects are tight, tension palpable, and when there's blood smeared everywhere you can count on Willis to deliver a sly line or two."
"ilikepuppies","5","19","42","25 April 2005"," Innovative on one level, tired on many others.
","The word ""innovation"" is thrown around frequently concerning this film. This word is indeed apt, but on very specific grounds. Credit must be given to how the action hero's personality is treated here. In 1988 the summer blockbuster action hero's demeanor as dead-serious stud was near-universally accepted as the only way to do it. Here we have Bruce tear down the archetype by playing it anything but serious, and letting the viewer know it. A unique delivery given the genre, and I suppose Willis deserves almost all the credit. But when considering that an actor's delivery is usually a minute percentage of a film's makeup this movie falls flat.<br/><br/>Consider: Common-man hero minding his own business is thrown into an oppressive situation. Reacts to oppression with a fountain of wisecracks. Proves that a lone righteous vigilante is far more effective than the combined efforts of the rest of law enforcement itself (represented here by the FBI, played by ugly actors). A seemingly irreconcilable personal relationship that is solved merely by our hero's courage (""Only John could irritate someone that much""). The obligatory--- one more villain crash the victory parade only to be shot by secondary hero--- bit. Lots of guns. Lots of big fireballs. Lots of money. Lots of punching. The list of tired movie clichés goes on and on. Not much original here.<br/><br/>And though the hero's personality is celebrated, it ultimately comes down to the tried and true notion that his ability to kick ass is his most important attribute. Like any action blockbuster, we leave the theater having learned nothing from our hero, experiencing no profound admiration for him, but merely acquiring a desire to kick as much ass. A kind of hero envy. Not unlike how ""Over the Top"" left us with the desire to enter an arm-wrestling competition. It seems that that quality is indeed all that matters. (The deaths of innocent civilians and FBI agents alike are ignored during the finale's party-down celebration.) All's well that ends well for the stud. The filmmakers here even show us how to channel our newfound heroic inspiration by showing the everyday wife punch out a journalist at the end.<br/><br/>So while this film may have re-invigorated the genre (not re-invented) it certainly did not do so in a particularly healthy way."

","I saw Die Hard three times when it came out and have watched it every Christmas since. What makes this action extravaganza a Christmas movie for me (other than the movie taking place on Christmas eve) I have no clue. It has to be the Jingle Bell sound effects, Christmas trees crashing in the lobby, or probably Bing Crosby singing 'Let It Snow' at the end. It has become my personal 'It's A Wonderful Life'. Anyway, enough with Christmas this movie is good, very good. Bruce Willis does one hell of a job as McClane. He has the physical look and street wise demeanor of a New York cop that makes his role deliver the movie just as much as Mel Gibson does for Lethal Weapon. And, one of the unconscious reasons I truly love this movie is that the terrorist aren't your run of the mill shoot'em up bad guys. They come across as smart sophisticated criminals who actually have a very good plan and aren't afraid to look you in the eye and shoot you without blinking. Alan Rickman the leader is a great villain. He comes complete with wit, snide remarks, and the always popular anti-American rhetoric. Another actor who does a great job holding up the movie is Reginald VelJohnson as Sargent Powell. His verbal battles with his boss are something that is encountered at offices across this great land everyday. Even the two FBI guys come complete with egos, good looking suits, and the names to match (great line that is usually missed by the normal viewer). As for action and sound it's an A+. That is a big reason I saw it three times. I knew it was going to be on video but I couldn't resist the explosions and glass sounds over and over. There are also sound bites and comedy that pops up and lets you release the tension. John McTiernan did great work setting up camera angles and shots that add to the excitement. Good examples is the shot in the air shaft (classic line included) and the shot from Powell's car as someone comes crashing down on it. You won't find to many better at delivering high paced action and all the trimmings that make this kind of movie a delight. A Christmas classic for years to come!!"

","This remains one of the modern-day ""classic"" movies that was so popular that is spun several sequels. It was just great entertainment value.<br/><br/>The story was ludicrous: one man beating a group of terrorists with outrageous, almost-impossible feats - another ""Rambo"" mentality flick - but it worked. The action scenes are memorable; Bruce Willis is good as the macho hero and David Warner is excellent as the villain.<br/><br/>Otherwise, the film is way too profane and too biased, as usual, against law enforcement showing the acting police chief and FBI agents to be arrogant, stupid and crude....just what Liberal Hollywood always does to anyone in authority. But John McTiernan gets away with his profanity-laden bias by directing a film that grabs you early on and never lets you go.....very involving."
"avik-basu1889","5","8","15","27 October 2014"," Willis vs Rickman !!!!
","This is the first film of the hugely popular action film franchise. The story involves a New York cop named John Mcclane(Bruce Willis) who is coming to California to meet his estranged wife on Christmas Eve at her office. Mcclane comes off as a rugged American cop from the 20th century who can't tolerate the life and the youth of California nor is he very well versed in high culture and art.He is a down to earth fellow who is not pretentious and says what he thinks without much complication. As luck would have it, on that very day i.e. on the Christmas Eve,a gang of German terrorists decide to break into the building and take hostages led by the infamous Hans Gruber played by Alan Rickman. Gruber is suave,sharp and well educated, so pretty much like the opposite of Mcclane. Mcclane gives the terrorists the slip and thus begins one man's fight to outsmart a whole gang of terrorists and save the day.<br/><br/>I know this is not the popular opinion, but I found this film very dull. It uses the clichéd story arc of a main character who has marriage problems and then by using unbelievable bravery in larger than life situations helps save the lives of people and again get into the good books of his wife. There are so many scenes which look unrealistic and cheesy. So many characters in this movie are downright idiots like the Deputy Police Commissioner, the FBI officials, Mcclane's Limo driver,etc. Some of the lines spoken by the Deputy Commissioner are almost laughably silly. I know action film scripts are supposed to have conveniences, but this film takes the benefit of too many of those. The ultimate encounter at the climax of the film ends with another silly set piece that only points to bad writing.<br/><br/>However having said that the film has a few things going for it. Bruce Willis and Alan Rickman are extremely good in their roles. Willis completely commits himself to the role physically and successfully sells the desperation of Mcclane's character. Rickman marvelously plays an intelligent and intimidating villain who has the ability to match the wits of our hero at every step. Lastly among the positives it has to be admitted that some of the action scenes and effects were very well executed considering it was the eighties.<br/><br/>But overall I found this to be an average action film and had it not been for Willis and Rickman, my rating would have been lower than 5/10. Some people will say that since I have watched so many films that have come after Die Hard which have used the plots and techniques used originally by Die Hard,I might not be able to appreciate the movie as much as I should, but I completely dismiss that thought. Seinfeld is a sitcom whose material has been used and reused in so many other sitcoms later, but when I still watch Seinfeld it looks and feels as witty and as sharp as ever. But unfortunately Die Hard doesn't pass that test. If this is the best out of all the films in the franchise, then sadly I have to bid farewell to John Mcclane as I am not interested in checking out the sequels anymore. Our paths won't converge again in the future."

","This film began a remarkable action movie franchise that runs around the detective John McClane of the New York Police Department. In this film, he will try to save the life of a group of hostages held captive in a corporate skyscraper of Los Angeles. Directed by John McTiernan, the film has a script of Jeb Stuart and Steven E. de Souza. Bruce Willis embodies the leading role. The film was nominated for four Oscars (Best Sound, Best Editing, Best Sound Effects, Best Visual Effects).<br/><br/>At first glance, this film does not look like anything special. Another eighties action movie, full of explosions, police cars made in pieces and bloodthirsty killers facing a single man, full of noble intentions. However, this film has something different: in a decade full of bullet proof heroes, this hero does not act (or looks) as something indestructible. He hurts himself, complains all the time and looks like a guy facing a situation beyond his control. So, its not difficult for the public to chear McClane, making Willis great performance the big advantage of the film.<br/><br/>Everything else followed, more or less, the pattern of the decade for action: stunning sets, special, visual and sound effects made with great care and regular performances from the rest of the cast (the interpretation of Alan Rickman, then still little known by non- British public, deserves a positive note of attention). This is an action film that captivates some audiences more adverse to this kind of movies, which proved to be the key to its success."
"supertom-3","10","3","4","30 January 2006"," The greatest action movie ever made!
","At the end of the 80's, that were all about shirtless muscle bound supermen taking on hundreds of foreign terrorists single-handed, Die Hard came out and changed the course of the action genre, whilst still having a shirtless and muscular (although not in Arnold or Dolph standards) hero, taking on a group of foreign terrorists single-handed. Die Hard though features a hero who is markedly more human and real than his rival action hero's. McClane is an ordinary guy and he damn near gets killed in this film and gets the hell beaten out of him, He takes a pummelling the likes of which Schwarzengger never received in the 80;s. He got a scratch at most.<br/><br/>So what makes Die Hard the single greatest action movie ever, and I'm talking action movie with an action hero and plenty of action, a proper lads movie. This is easily the best. The basic premise is basic. Terrorists take over a building and Bruce Willis in the right place at the right time (or wrong?) is on hand to stop them. Yet the film has a brilliant script. This is chock full of witty writing (The two agent Johnson's, the idiotic police chief, the slimy co-worker Ellis), set-ups and pay-offs and great little touches. Die Hard also features some scenes that are hilarious. It's just funny and combined with the direction of John McTiernan, this is a thrill ride start to finish and unsurpassed in its combination of action and humour.<br/><br/>Furthermore Willis is superb and also it must be noted can act, and is allowed to. It can be argued that Arnold, Jean Claude, Steven and Dolph are not great thespians, and it'd be a well granted argument. Doing the simple stuff is not a problem, but stretching the acting muscles reveals that those muscles are not nearly as defined as the bicep, tricep and whatever-cep, muscles! Then there is Sly Stallone who can act given the chance, yet aside from First Blood his action movies don't allow him for more than 6 lines of dialogue or much in the way of stretching. Willis however rejuvenates the action hero character by giving him personality, following on from Mel Gibson's Riggs (Lethal Weapon), the year before. He has personality, he speaks and he emotes. He's not cool as ice, he is a real guy in an extraordinary situation. Willis delivers a great performance here, one of the best in an action man movie, because he's human, and charismatic. Similarly the rest of the cast are great. Generally a lot of action movies aren't too concerned with the co-stars acting talents, because the leads aren't much kop, but Die Hard loads the film with good actors, everyone delivering. This makes for a more exciting movie when the actors are so convincingly real. Alan Rickman is superbly slimy and cool as Hans Gruber, the super slick German terrorist whose icy demeanour is only ever pierced by the annoying and troublesome McClaine. Then we have number 1, baddest bad guy henchman ever, the big blond fella Karl played by Alexander Gudonov. Not forgetting Bonnie Bedelia, Reg VelJohnson, Paul Gleason, Robert Davi and Grant Bush. <br/><br/>McTiernan is one of the masters of crafting an action scene. Sadly when recounting his work, he hasn't hit the bull's-eye on enough of his movies, yet in Die Hard and Predator he emerged as one of the action king directors of the decade, along with Jim Cameron, Walter Hill and Richard Donner to name a few. The action here is superb and not forgetting in a setting that could have caused problems creating enough varied and well choreographed action scenes. Above all this has scale, it's big. it's the equivalent of the big bloated blockbusters of today that rise past 150 million dollars in cost, yet lack the skill of this film.<br/><br/>Die Hard features quality in all departments from the cast, the crew to the superb score from Michael Kamen, and thus far no other action film comes close to this ones entertainment and repeatability. *****"
"BrandtSponseller","10","3","4","10 May 2005"," Cemented the template for contemporary action films
","Lots of subtexts have been read into this film over the years--and anyone who has read a few of my reviews knows that I'm no enemy to reading subtexts into films, whether they were intended by the filmmakers or not. Die Hard has also sometimes been taken as one of the most infamous, token examples of ""what went wrong with Hollywood"". But when we get right down to it, Die Hard is so great simply because it's a tightly constructed, kick-ass action film that barely pauses a moment to let you breathe once it gets rolling. It may not have created the contemporary action template, but it certainly did a lot to cement it. Without Die Hard, we may well have not had films like Speed (1994), The Rock (1996), Air Force One (1997) or Panic Room (2002).<br/><br/>In Die Hard, Bruce Willis is John McClane, a New York City cop who is heading out to Los Angeles to visit his estranged wife, Holly (Bonnie Bedelia), and their two kids for Christmas. Holly's boss, Joseph Takagi (James Shigeta), has sent a limousine to pick John up at the airport. John stops by Holly's office in a large high-rise, partially to try to figure out where he's going to stay. Holly's coworkers are having a late Christmas Eve party--they're the last ones in the building, and they're 30-something stories up. Suddenly, ""terrorists"" take control of the building. It seems they have an issue with Holly's employer, the Nakatomi Corporation. John is able to hide and sneak away before they see him, but can one cop take control of 12 highly armed, highly trained ""terrorists""? <br/><br/>Director John McTiernan, who was fresh off of his success from 1987's Predator, actually begins the film in a mode that is more akin to light comedy and deliberately paced drama. This helps intensify the contrast that shortly follows, although McTiernan periodically retains humor in the guise of sardonically hammy one-liners, mostly delivered by our hero. This was already becoming something of a cliché by the time Die Hard arrived, largely due to the influence of Arnold Schwarzenegger in the action genre (although many of his best one-liners were still ahead of him). Still, McTiernan's use of this sometimes-loathed device is incredibly effective as it is the only means of providing short respites from the nail-biting suspense and action. And besides, ""Yippee-ki-yay mf'er"" has to be one of the most memorable and funny--if silly--one-liners of all time.<br/><br/>It's interesting that if you really analyze the plot, a large percentage of the suspense is created by merely maneuvering John and the terrorists around the building. The action scenes are not as frequent as they seem; McTiernan sustains a very high level of intensity through a surprisingly classical approach. The bulk of the film is an extended cat and mouse game, occasionally punctuated with gun violence and less occasionally physical combat. Of course, since the film is set in a skyscraper--the combination of Towering Inferno (1974) thrills and a very contemporary (both in 1988 and now) terrorist plot is a large part of what initially created a buzz--some of the more edge-of-your-seat moments are based on heights.<br/><br/>In this type of action film, one of the most important traits for the lead actor to have is an impressive, plausible ""superhero"" physical presence. Willis, in his early 30s during filming, was perfect for the role. His slightly frumpy, balding look makes him believable as a New York City cop, but his physique is also in peak form here, while not being so over the top that you expect him to oil up and start flexing. The ""terrorists"" are appropriately different looking--more suave and sophisticated, as if they could be on the cover of a romance novel if they'd just beef up a bit and put down the machine guns. The other roles, insofar as they're significant (and a number are), are finely played if often campy, as they should be--it helps the audience adjust to the cartoonish fates of most of the support characters who are substantial enough to have an arc.<br/><br/>As for those subtexts, there are a lot of interesting things you can read into the film's structure--foreigners are either bad guys or wildly successful capitalists who perhaps have a touch of ""bad guy"" in their threat to national sovereignty (this is especially true if we place the film in its historical-cultural context, as paranoia about ""Asians buying up America"", which has since subsided, was just beginning to loom large at the time). African Americans are limited to roles of moral support for the white male hero--entertainment historian Donald Bogle, who has made numerous studies of African Americans in film, amusingly interpreted the role of Sgt. Al Powell (Reginald VelJohson) as that of ""black-buddy-as-mammy nurturer"". And even though Holly has an ostensibly important position in the company, we see her as mostly subservient, manipulated or helpless. The other females in the film, to the extent that there are any, are primarily present as ""decorations"" at best.<br/><br/>But the bigger question is whether any of those sociological issues of race, power, xenophobia and male domination are intended by the film. My guess is that they aren't, even if they're present due to other cultural factors. A big summer action movie in the U.S. needs a big action star, and for whatever reason, those had been primarily white males. The villains also needed to be almost cartoonish and mistakable for terrorists, and in the late 1980s, putting white male Americans as terrorists would have made the film implausible for much of the audience, and other kinds of Americans in the role (white females, blacks, etc.) would have been seen as equally political. McTiernan wasn't trying to make political or sociological statements so much as provide us with an exciting roller-coaster of a film, and that he did with flying colors."

Mind you quote what the body-count here contributes to the season of goodwill to all men is open to interpretation. Still, for thrills, stunts and spectacle ""Die Hard"" certainly delivers, less so for characterisation, plot and credibility, although I suppose it was ever thus for action blockbusters like this. Bruce Wilis advances into the heavyweight corner with his performance here, even if his wise-cracking persona seems to have carried over from ""Moonlighting"", although where he picked up his pliability and durability along the way, again is anybody's guess. I liked Willis in ""Moonlighting"" so it's not surprising I like him here. His John McClane is capable it seems of startling feats of death-defying derring-do, but at least he gets there from an inauspicious start when he initially seems terrified and clueless as to how to cope with the heist situation. He squares off well against smooth, metronomic, but sadistic Alan Rickman, in his first big movie role, as the robber's leader proves a good foil. The stunts are excellent, although the soundtrack and fashions have dated poorly. Nevertheless, the action steams ahead from almost the start and rarely lets up thereafter, Bruce working his way through what looks like a bunch of try-outs for 80's hairbands. At various points I picked up on Christmas in the background, even if the film as a whole has little to do with the traditional festive spirit . Still, I watched it all the way through and even though I'm more a Jimmy Stewart /Cary Grant man around this time of year, I can see how it came to define a whole sub-genre of 80's blockbuster."

","One of the most important movies in the action genre.There is probably no one who hasn't heard of Die Hard and John McClane-one of the big daddies of action.I have heard all kinds of stories about this movie.In my country for example people were waiting in lines half a day to get tickets and see this masterpiece pretty much like The Godfather before it.Until then most movies here were Russian which by definition means bad movies.So by the late 80s this was one of the grand movies and people were shocked and thrilled by the sudden quality change in films.This is the movie that turned Bruce Willis into an international star and introduced an action hero who unlike Arnold and Sly isn't a superhuman but a more ordinary guy who is just at the wrong place at the wrong time.He uses his head and harsh language to come up with solutions to nasty situations.And Willis's McClane is one of the coolest and toughest guys on film.Everything about this guy rocks.He gave a whole new look to action heroes.He doesn't give a crap about no one and always keeps his promises.Alan Rickman is a great,intelligent and memorable villain-a real threat to our boy.The action is spectacular and gives a new definition of 1 guy vs many guys.A advice you to immediately watch this everlasting masterpiece if you haven't already and see what all the fuzz is about."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","4","6","3 March 2008"," The predecessor and epitome of modern day action films
","What makes ""Die Hard"" so good is that it still holds its own in the 21st century despite changes in the way films are done and special effects are created today. It set up a framework for which other action films could be successful, adding new equations to the action blockbuster formula.<br/><br/>The plot is the first demonstration of a ""scenario thriller,"" or a plot that revolves around one single event and/or place. It's' simple: terrorists are attempting to steal from a wealthy businessman so they hold up and rig the building. One 90s film that for sure got its legs from ""Die Hard"" was ""Air Force One."" Part of what makes ""Die Hard"" so good is that it sets up a premise that is easy to follow but also suspenseful. It creates its twists and turns within the main line of the plot, so you can see it all coming if you think about it, but it keeps the intensity up.<br/><br/>Next step toward success is John McClane. You have an off-duty cop thrust into the vortex of something that he had no intention of getting involved in. It is the birth of the unsung action hero in a sense, the rebel who has what it takes, but never really knew it until he is forced into a situation. Part of what makes McClane such a good character is that while he is bad ass, he shows signs of humanity, praying that the cops will show up to help him and talking to himself.<br/><br/>While not the film's strong suit, the subplot between McClane and his wife makes the plot work better and provides some more footing for the plot itself. Even the relationship formed between McClane and Sgt. Powell as they struggle to get the higher ups to believe them is an important part of the film. It's not exactly well put together, but it helps with the film's main goal of being a great action film, giving it just the extra amount of suspense.<br/><br/>Lastly, the action is just good and the relationships between McClane and the terrorists is great and sometimes amusing. When McClane comes face to face with Hans Gruber, the head terrorist, and doesn't know it's him, you have a dynamic unique to action films. There's a lot of great clever action moments and stuff blows up, which is always a plus when it's not the center of what goes on. It's worth watching ""Die Hard"" just in respect to a film that inspired many of the great action films we watch today."

","Die Hard is, in my opinion, the best all out action movie I have ever seen. What sets it apart is the great set up (keeping in mind that watching it today it will seem all too familiar because of all the imitators that came after - but Die Hard was the first), the great character of John McClane (Bruce Willis in the role that made him a MOVIE STAR) and the intense action. There is nothing like the wild scrambling of Bruce Willis as he tries to not only survive, but to save the hostages.

","New York City cop John McClane has flown to Los Angeles to reconcile with his estranged wife, Holly. He arrives on Christmas Eve and heads to Holly's office, where her company's Christmas party is in full swing. Holly does not work for some ordinary company. She works for the Nakatomi Corporation, whose headquarters are located high up in the Nakatomi Plaza skyscraper which is still under construction. In this office there is a vault. In this vault there are bearer bonds worth $640 million. Enter Hans Gruber. He and his heavily-armed goons storm the building, take everybody hostage and set in motion their plan to open that vault and get that money. Only one thing stands in their way: John McClane.<br/><br/>McClane is conveniently the only person in the building who manages to escape being taken hostage. He then conveniently manages to stay alive as a whole swarm of well-trained, heavily-armed terrorists continually fires at him with machine guns and attempts to blow him to smithereens with powerful explosives. He makes quite the nuisance of himself, Hans is not pleased. Anyhow, there's a lot of shooting and a lot of things blowing up...and then there's a lot more shooting and a lot more things blowing up...and then...well, you get the picture. It's basically two hours of this on an endless loop. It's an action movie that indeed has lots of action but that action gets repetitive rather quickly. This movie is often described as innovative and revolutionary. That's overselling it by quite some distance. It's an average shoot-'em-up action movie. No more, no less.<br/><br/>The best thing the movie has going for it is the talents of its two leads. Bruce Willis plays the hero, Alan Rickman plays the villain and if anything in this movie rises above the level of cliché it is their performances. Willis infuses McClane with some personality, delivering wisecracks which bring a smile to your face. Rickman makes Hans into a rather unique villain, a detestable guy to be sure but one with some serious intelligence and cunning. Unfortunately these two main characters spend very little time actually squaring off with one another, McLane spending the bulk of the movie dealing with a bunch of anonymous bad guys you really don't care about. Supporting characters offer very little support. Aside from McClane and Hans there's not much there. Reginald VelJohnson has a few good moments playing an LAPD officer who comes onto the scene. Unfortunately he is soon overshadowed by a deputy police chief character whose stupidity is just mind-boggling. Any momentum the movie threatens to gather comes to a screeching halt anytime this guy opens his mouth. Then some FBI guys show up and remarkably they're even worse. There's a lot of stupidity outside Nakatomi Plaza. And there aren't enough interesting things happening inside the building. Die Hard is a movie which is considered to be a standout in the action movie genre, a classic. The truth is it's a rather ordinary movie."
"Ryno_II","4","30","83","15 February 2005"," A very overrated action film.
","This movie is on this sites top 250 but I can't figure out why so many people like it. The problem simply is that John McClane makes one stupid decision after another.<br/><br/>SPOILERS AHEAD<br/><br/>The scene where Tony is looking for John and is obviously going to kill him with that submachine of his is the best example.<br/><br/>John sneaks up behind Tony and presses his semi-auto against his head, then pistol whips and then fight him with his bare hands, instead of forcing him to relinquish the gun first. Tony then tries to shoot John. Any averagely smart cop would have shot Tony.<br/><br/>Another example is the scene where John was trying to signal the cop, Al by breaking the window with the chair. A gunman comes into the room, but John is ready for him. With his pistol raised he tells the gunman to put his gun down. John has no back up or assistance to take restrain the guy so attempting to force the guy to surrender wouldn't be wise. Another gunman enters the room just after that, and because John chose not to shoot the first one who entered, that makes things a lot more challenging.<br/><br/>And the third is, in the scene where John meets Hans, face to face for the first time. Hans is unarmed, and John has a gun pointed at him. They both hear the elevator arrive at the floor they're on, which of course means more henchmen are coming. For some reason John doesn't shoot Hans as the elevator doors begin to open. He shoots at the henchmen just as they are coming out out of elevator and runs. The mistake there was leaving Hans alive. I know the filmmakers wouldn't want the hero killing of the main villain early, but couldn't the writers come up with a scenario in which the hero couldn't kill the villain early? Couldn't they write a script that makes sense of the characters? <br/><br/>The lieutenant who kept arguing with Al, never followed logic either. There was no reason why he would have any doubt that there are terrorist in the building. If he is that dumb then why is he that high promoted?"
"ilithmar","3","27","76","13 August 2002"," A Headache
","How this movie enters into IMDB's top 250 is beyond me.  This film is not a well-crafted work of art, but a dull, banal, predictable action blockbuster.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis plays John McClane, a cop who's arrived at his wife's company's party.  He escapes unnoticed when a terrorist leader (Alan Rickman) and his lackeys take the party hostage.  They are after the company's money, and won't be leaving until they get it. Well, surprise, surprise, but a certain cop decides to be the hero and stop them.  And this is no ordinary cop  he seems to be able to dodge bullets (think of the `miracle' scene in Pulp Fiction, many times over).<br/><br/>Our so-called good-guy also kills ruthlessly, whilst our bad-guys seem to be very merciful.  The amount of times they have McClane at gunpoint and let him escape is unbelievable.  By the end you get the feeling that Brucey's character is very much invincible.<br/><br/>The one good point of the movie is Alan Rickman.  He is an excellent actor, and his character is the one likeable one in the entire movie.  Bruce Willis, who is usually excellent, is disappointing as all he manages to do well is shoot a gun and not die.  The rest of the acting is fairly forgettable action movie acting, but that is acceptable in a movie of this time, whose purpose is to excite and not to make the viewer think.<br/><br/>Obviously if you are thinking of seeing this movie you won't be looking for a deep and meaningful picture, but you'll be looking for a thrill-packed experience.  Die Hard will not give you this; it will most likely give you a headache (if my opinion is anything to go by).  If you want to see an exciting action movie about hostages in a tower, forget Die Hard, and go and see The Negotiator (8/10).<br/><br/>I give Die Hard 3/10."

","""Die Hard"" features Bruce Willis as John McClane, a police officer combatting a group of terrorists holding hostages in an LA office building. Willis makes a decent action hero as John McClane and injected a welcome humor into the role. Inevitably McClane gets into a number of conflicts with the terrorists. There are some notable action scenes and special effects, but a lot of the action is repetitive shoot-outs. This would be fine if there were more story developments, but the developments are few and far between.<br/><br/>The most interesting developments in the film revolved around the twists Hans Gruber engineers to thwart the inept efforts of the police when they attempt to enter the office building. Alan Rickman's performance as the refined and calculating yet sarcastic Hans Gruber is the highlight of the film. Most of the supporting characters were either unremarkable or unnecessary, particularly the incompetent deputy chief of police. However, having ""Al"", the one savvy policeman who showed some character depth and genuine concern was touching. Overall I found ""Die Hard"" to be mostly tedious, contrary to the popular opinion of the film as a fast-paced thriller. The one strongly redeeming feature of the film was Alan Rickman's memorable performance as Hans Gruber."
"Leofwine_draca","10","2","3","25 June 2016"," It can't be bettered
","This original action classic has been hugely influential over the years - and it's no surprise, as it's one of the best action thrillers ever made. New meaning is brought to the word ""action"" as here it is exhilarating, furious and nothing less than exciting. The premise is simple: one location, one good guy and twelve bad guys. Cue lots of explosions, fist fights, blood, violence, and plenty of shooting too. The thrills come from the suspense of Willis using his wits as well as his brawn to fight the bad guys and save the hostages.<br/><br/>When watching this film what becomes immediately apparent is how fresh it is. This hasn't been filmed with some cheap cameras for a quick buck, it looks professional and couldn't be less polished. The photography is clear and brings out the best of the surroundings, while the music has obviously been carefully chosen to convey the right mood. And, strangely enough for an action film, the acting is actually very good. Unheard of, as remember this was back in the days where Schwarzenegger and Stallone were the top stars of the action genre. Bruce Willis excels as the wisecracking, sardonic cop, and you can't fail to like him. He's consistently witty and provides a powerful presence when needed - it comes as no surprise as he lived off this image for the next six or seven years.<br/><br/>The supporting cast aren't half bad, either. The reliable Bonnie Bedelia takes a break from her usual highbrow, ""moral dilemma"", television movie fare as Willis' tough wife, while Reginald Veljohnson is also great as a sympathetic cop - you just want to hug him. But most memorable of all is Alan Rickman for his excellent turn as the cool, calculating terrorist with a carefully-crafted German accent and a fine line in natty suits. Rickman is THE bad guy of modern cinema, watch any subsequent action film with terrorists and you'll see people trying to be him. He's that good. The rest of the cast of terrorists have all been picked for their imposing looks, and they're not bad either. Keep your eyes peeled for fearsome Bond baddie Robert Davi in a minor role as an FBI man.<br/><br/>As well as the tense running around in corridors and stand-offs between Willis and the various creeps, this film really delivers in the action stakes. The guys here really do look like they are trying their hardest to kill each other, and we get people flying down stairs, getting chains wrapped around their necks, getting shot all over the place. Every kill that Willis makes is original and exciting. There are also plenty of ace stunts, like when Willis jumps off an exploding roof with only a fire hose tied around his waist. The gore level is high, graphic in fact, with people being shot apart wherever you look, and it's definitely a film for all cinema fans to enjoy. Consistently entertaining and strong enough to withstand repeated viewings, this is the first and final word on the ""one guy versus lots of bad guys"" sub-genre of the action flick."
"matthewssilverhammer","9","2","3","9 April 2016"," McClane / Gruber Death Match
","It's no secret that Die Hard is as thrilling, fun, and cool as a movie can get; and those superlatives all describe Willis's John McClane. He has what all heroes should have: relatability, brains, and wry sense of humor to-boot. The now iconic glass-plagued-feet are a perfect visual for what makes Die Hard stand out. Instead of just another god-like protagonist, we get a reminder of his intact humanity, whose stakes never let us believe he's invincible. On the other side is Hans Gruber. Rickman's villain set the tone for action villains for the 20th and 21st centuries. He has what all villains should have: clear motive and ineffable charisma. Like McClane, he's not just a towering beefcake; his strength is his charm, his lies speaking directly to modern fears of terrorism. This was the anti-Schwarzenegger/anti-Stallone punch-n-gun-fest; it was an unassuming thriller, known as much for its smirk and wit as its brawn. Not that these two characters are the only great aspects in the film. The script is tight, the editing is sharp, the action is tense and the humor never misses a beat. But the head-to-head, McClane-Gruber enigmatic death match is what has implanted this forever in the zeitgeist. It may be sacrilege to watch this apart from the Christmas season, but regardless of what is decking the halls, it would be more of a shame to miss seeing this in theaters. Let's send a message, that we want well-constructed and thoughtful action flicks, not lazy money-grabs (I'm looking at you, Batman and Superman)."

","""I now have a machine gun. Ho ho ho"". The iconic taunt by hotshot NYC cop John Mcclane to the terrorists he's evading in a gigantic LA high rise that's under siege. This is the prototype, patient x, the catalyst for an army of homages, imitations, sequels and an entire subculture of action movie mania. It's got few bells or whistles, nothing too extravagant like a lot of the CGI laden PG-13 crap that masquerades as action these days (I'm looking at you Expendables 3), just a good old fashioned, down n' dirty piece of bloody holiday fun with one of the most exciting set ups in any flick of the genre. Bruce Willis has probably never been better as the wise cracking, amusingly self deprecating tough guy who wants nothing to do with the situation, just wants to reconnect with his estranged wife (Bonnie Bedelia) on Christmas Eve and take it easy. The extremists have other ideas, though, ruthlessly taking the skyscraper she works in hostage and locking it down like Fort Knox. Mcclane cunningly infiltrates it, and the bone crunching, bullet spraying Yuletide joy takes off, hardly letting up for a minute. Mcclane is both helped and hindered by law enforcement outside the building, including sympathetic beat cop Al Powell (Reginald VelJohnson) idiotic Police Chief Dwayne T. Robinson (Paul Gleason) and interfering FBI Agents Big (Robert Davi) and Little (Grand L. Bush) Johnson. The Christmas wreath for best performance of the film has to go to Alan Rickman though. He so rarely shows up in fun genre stuff like this, and his presence always chromes up whatever the film is to perfection. He plays absolutely evil German psychopath Hans Gruber, leader of the terrorists and bane of Mcclane's existence, just the rotten murdering bastard you hope to see in the villain slot in every film like this. The shining example that all action films should aspire to be, the zenith of slam bang flicks, and a good dose of Christmas cheer too. Yippee ki yay motherfvcker"
"MUFCOK","8","2","3","22 January 2015"," Now this is an action flick!
","I have no reasonable explanation as to how I got to the age of 24 without seeing Die Hard. I finally watched Die Hard last Christmas and I have to say that I found it incredibly entertaining! 80's action films are usually corny and cheesy, Die Hard did have its one liners and many cliché moments but it had so much more than that. It has depth, it has characters that you care about, characters that you can connect to and genuinely tense moments that don't feel forced. Die Hard is set in a multi storey office tower, it's Christmas Eve and an office party is in full swing. John McClane (Bruce Willis) is visiting his wife there as the office is held hostage by terrorists looking to get rich and get out. John McClane is out of the terrorists sights as they gather the hostages and takes it upon himself to bring them down one by one, on his own. Die Hard is essentially an 80's style, adrenaline fuelled game of cat and mouse. A dozen terrorists against an off duty cop, 30 floors up in a half renovated tower block!<br/><br/>I am not the biggest fan of Bruce Willis but I must say I did like him in Die Hard, it is by far his strongest performance and he certainly plays to his strengths. Alan Rickman gives a fantastic performance as Hans Gruber, the leader of the terrorist group. He is intense and intimidating and has a real presence when he is on screen. He isn't your stereotypical villain and I think this is what makes his performance so special.<br/><br/>You must remember that this is an 80's action flick so expect the cliché scenarios, the one liners, the explosions and the 'as if you could do that' moments. This is probably one of my favourite 80's action films and I would recommend it to anyone who likes this genre (but to be honest you have probably seen it countless times already)<br/><br/>9/10"

","It always throws my family for a loop that I watch DIE HARD every Christmas. But I can't help it, it's tradition. It's been a Top 5 of mine for many years and I don't see that changing anytime soon. It's a first-rate action/thriller and takes everything great about the action genre and just makes it better. If the screen isn't being owned by Bruce Willis and Alan Rickman (riveting performances, both), there's the welcome comic relief of Hart Bockner, Paul Gleason and the FBI guys. It features a score that's Michael Kamen at his best, striking photography, a relatable hero and a script with no throwaway scenes. Part of the fun of watching this movie is getting to spend two hours inside the Nakatomi building. The sets reflect the building's opulence, and even the unfinished floors provide all sorts of atmosphere. <br/><br/>It's impressive how many things DIE HARD gets right. Let me put it this way: compare this to the more recent entries in the series. It's a jarring difference.<br/><br/>10/10"

Problems arise when Terrorists take over the building where the party is being held and it's up to McClaine to save the day.<br/><br/>With great action scenes, some solid pacing, brilliant casting and a superb sense of atmosphere this is perfect entertainment. Is It believable?? not really, but it's not so unbelievable that you just dismiss it as unrealistic.<br/><br/>One of the things I love about this movie is Willis's performance. He often resorts to using his brain and wits to beat bad guys, if Stallone or Schwarzenegger were cast they would have easily dispatched the terrorists with ease and a machine gun and a never ending supply of bullets ala Rambo or Commando. Willis plays McClaine as human, he is scared, he is vulnerable and he gets hurt and feels pain. It also helps matters that Willis can deliver a deadpan one liner better than most in Hollywood.<br/><br/>The clever pacing makes it easy to skip over the few plot holes, and there is not one weak link in the cast. As brilliant as Willis is, its Alan Rickman as Hans Gruber who steals the movie. Every line is delivered to perfection. Bonnie Bedilia also knocks it out of the park as Willis's estranged wife Holly. Reginald VelJohnson is also worthy of note as Sergeant Al Powell.<br/><br/>This should be viewed at least once every Christmas."

All of those elements make Die Hard an outstanding movie that is John McTierman and Bruce Willis at their best.<br/><br/>Based on the novel Nothing Lasts Forever by Roderick Thorp and set in Los Angeles,California,Die Hard tells the story of John McClane(Bruce Willis),a New York City police officer who is visiting his estranged wife Holly Gennero(Bonnie Bedelia)at the Nakotomi Building where she works on Christmas Eve where there is a party going on. While John is at the Nakotomi building a group of terrorist led by Hans Gruber(Alan Rickman)take the building and the workers hostage and it's up to John to stop Hans and his group at all costs.<br/><br/>Released in 1988,Die Hard is a brilliant and thrilling movie that was not only a critical and Box Office success but is also made Bruce Willis a movie star and became one of the most influential films of the Action genre that spawned four sequels and changed the genre forever paving the way for other Action movies such as Speed(Die Hard on a Bus),Under Siege(Die Hard on a boat)and Passenger 57(Die Hard on a plane)while at the same time giving viewers a new kind of Action hero. Sure,there were plenty of other influential and amazing Action movie classics that were released before Die Hard Action movies such as Lethal Weapon,Predator,The Terminator,First Blood,Rambo:First Blood Part II,Commando,48 Hrs,The Warriors,Dirty Harry,The French Connection,Escape From New York,The Road Warrior and many more but when Die Hard came out it brought something new to the Action genre and was seen as a breath of fresh air that set the standard for Action movies that followed. From beginning to end Die Hard is a masterful Action film that is Action-packed and exciting as well as very intense and explosive with an energy and pace that is non-stop because Die Hard grabs the viewer by the throat and never lets go. With Die Hard is a movie that is a full-on spectacle where everything whether it's the gunfight or explosions is big and nothing is small with Action on every corner and suspense that is like a tightrope and is gripping. What also makes Die Hard such an incredible movie is the dialog and Humor which is clever,smart and funny with scenes that are memorable and lines that are quotable with perhaps the most iconic line that is said by John McClane which is unforgettable. And while Die Hard isn't an Action-Comedy in the truest sense the film balances Action and laughs perfectly. Die Hard is probably the best Action set right around the Christmas holiday(with Lethal Weapon being the runner up). I don't what it is about Action movies that are set during Christmas or the holidays but the mixture of intense Action and beautiful Christmas decorations is just so much fun. The Action scenes in Die Hard are dazzling,powerful and done in such a flawless way that is jaw dropping and will knock your socks off every time you watch it because each Action is like a fire ball that hits in the face. Die Hard gave birth to one of the greatest,iconic and truly unforgettable characters in the history of cinema in John McClane who is not a classic character but was a new kind of Action hero. Before Die Hard Action movie characters were muscular and had strong arms but John McClane was different and unique because he was a regular guy and average Joe who didn't come to LA to save the day or be a hero but to see his wife for Christmas. When we watch Die Hard we as the viewer relate to McClane and are with him every step of the way whether he's dealing with terrorists or trying to repair his relationship with his wife. Despite his problems John McClane is still tough and handles his problems with both his wits,guns and fists. John McClane is terrific character that set the standard for Action heroes that came after and is someone you will never forget and is one of the reasons Die Hard is a classic. The ending of Die Hard is outstanding and is filled with enough excitement and thrills that will put smiles on viewers faces. A terrific ending.<br/><br/>The cast is great. Bruce Willis is excellent,iconic and at his best as John McClane with Willis being tough,charismatic and likable. Alan Rickman(in his film debut)is brilliant as Hans Gruber one of the best villains in movie history with Rickman being charming and evil. Bonnie Bedelia is terrific as Holly Gennaro,John McClaine's Wife. Reginald VelJohnson is wonderful as Sgt. Al Powell,a cop that communicates with John on the outside. Paul Gleason is outstanding as Deputy Chief Dwanye Y Robinson,a Cop in way over his head. William Atherton is sensational as Richard Thornberg,a jerk News reporter. Alexander Godunav is intense as Karl,one of the terrorists. Hart Bochner(Ellis),James Shigeta(Takagi),De'Voreaux White(Argyle),Clarence Gilyard Jr.(Theo),Robert Davi(FBI Special Agent Big Johnson)and Grand L. Bush(FBI Special Agent Little Johnson)and Mary Ellen Trainor(Gail Wallens)give good performances as well.<br/><br/>The direction by John McTierman is fantastic and memorable,with McTierman always moving the camera while using close-ups and angles giving the movie the right tone. Great Direction,McTierman.<br/><br/>The score by Michael Kamen is amazing,thrilling,suspenseful and matches the Action of the movie well. Amazing score,Kamen.<br/><br/>In final word,if you love Action Films,Bruce Willis or John McTierman,I highly suggest you see Die Hard,the greatest Action Film Ever made and a classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended.. 10/10."

If you're not a fan of action films, but have to see one, then my advise is to watch Die Hard because it contains almost everything you always wanted in a action movie - something other action movies are unable to provide.<br/><br/>The story is about a New York cop called ""John McClane"" (Bruce Willis), who is on his way to LA to meet his wife to patch some things up, but little does he know that there are a bad dozen or so criminals heading where he's heading (Nakatomi Plaza), and he has the toughest job in not only saving himself and taking on the bad guys, but also saving the hostages too, so the odds are heavily stacked against him.<br/><br/>For me, the best thing about the movie was the villain himself: Hans Gruber. He's probably right up there among the greatest movie villains of all time. Hans Gruber is a psychopath.<br/><br/>The movie has a great setting with a very good story, with plenty of action along with some ""lightful"" humour. Somehow, it just worked.<br/><br/>Die Hard is without doubt the greatest action movie of all time. Die Hard deserves a ten rating. You won't be disappointed that's for sure unless you hate action movies.<br/><br/>This movie was made in the eighties, and not during the nineties guys, which automatically makes Die Hard a unique film in itself since most of the best action movies was made all throughout the nineties.

","When you talk about the 80's action star Stallone and Schwarzenegger get most of the credit but die hard created possibly the most relatable action star ever in Bruce Willis as John mclane. This film sees a group of terrorists led by Hans Gruber attack a Christmas party for ransom with new York cop John mclane the only man capable of stopping them. Now I love Bruce Willis in this film and I think that his performance in this film helped shape his career to what it is. Mclane is a bad ass but his anger and one liners make him relatable to us and why we truly want him to win. But what is a good hero without a good villain and Alan richtman as gruber was fantastic and the great foil for our hero mclane. The cop al he communicates with is a great addition too s it gives some good moments between him and Willis. Other performances from Mrs mclane and the police chief were good and got the job done in this film. The story was unique for the time and a great concept that won't be topped by the greatness of this film. The script is superb with Willis and richtman having wonderful lines and really adding to this great action film with the humour. The unique style of violence and Christmas worked really well and it was a great decision for this film. This is one of my favourite films and I always look forward to seeing it."

","OK. I admit it: I've seen ""Die Hard"" over 100 times. I'll watch it EVERY single time it's on. I have the DVD. When I'm depressed, I'll watch ALL five ""Die Hards."" They cheer me up. However, it's the first one - the only one - that I really, really love. I've always liked Bruce from his ""Moonlighting"" David Addison and most of his movies, such as ""The Sixth Sense."" I always come back to John McClane. My obsessive watching of ""Die Hard,"" causes inevitable grief to family members: ""Oh no, not again."" Or ""Quick. Don't let her see the satellite grid. 'Die Hard's' on again!!"" Or, ""Did you hide the five DVDs; she's getting ready for a McClane binge watch."" To add to the family's consternation, I countered with ""'Die Hard' Dialogue Day"" where in I only answer in comments and statements from the movie. It's pretty easy when you have the entire film memorized. Sometimes, I find it appropriate to sneak in dialogue from the other four films, but I generally keep it to DHI. I like, for example, ""Well, maybe that mime..."" from DHIII, and references to ""The Warlock."" But, my heart belongs to DHI. I have always been a fan of the adventure film (no rom-coms, chick flicks, and sappy ""Hangover-type"" stuff). Real men, like John McClane don't do demeaning activities. They just take out terrorists - twelve or so at a clip, barefoot, in an blackened undie shirt, and one gun - and only wits, humor, and cleverness. Now, I must go and program, with the help of my techie daughter, my new phone so its ring tone will be - ah, you guessed it - ""Yippee - Kay- Yay...."" and you know the rest. John, ve du not alter za plan - ever. (I'm that analog woman in a digital world, too.)"
"Fedorahawk","9","2","3","28 May 2014"," The Start of Something Great
","Die Hard can be defined as the most influential action film of the late 1980's. The film may not be the most unique when it comes to story or dialogue, but it makes up for that by making itself extremely rememberable. What I find to be the most important aspect of the film, however, is the main character John McClane. As an action hero, he is surpassingly relatable. Unlike other actions heroes of the 80's, John is not invincible. He gets hurt like a normal human being, showing his human side, and having the viewer feel for the character. And of course the action is impressive and the basic storyline is still enjoyable. There are real no negatives that can really be pointed out, it isn't perfect, but it is a classic, unforgettable film. All in all, the acting is good, the dialogue is hokey but lovable, the action euphoric and the story typical but still captivating. I would rather not bring up the sequels, for that is for another time. I would like to look at the original Die Hard as something separated from the future pains that follow."

","Die Hard is John McTiernan's 2nd masterpiece of his action trilogy shot back to back to back starting with Predator, Die Hard, and then The Hunt for Red October.<br/><br/>This film took a usually dark genre (terrorist movies) and applied humor, empathy, wit, suspense, and dynamic action to deliver something incredibly iconic and influential. It catapulted Bruce Willis' television career to movie star caliber. It cemented John Mctiernan's reputation as a great director of action with brains. The level of suspense in this film is amazing with high level intensity. What's great about the films is it displays that bad guys can be smart, intelligent, and sophisticated. It also shows that the hero can make mistakes, beaten, suffered, but also resilient. This films still holds up today and has been ripped of countless times since it has become its own genre (Die Hard). <br/><br/>Die Hard on a Ship (Under Siege), Die Hard on Bus (Speed), Die Hard on Plane (Air Force One), Die Hard on Alcatraz (The Rock), Die Hard on a Cruise Ship (Speed 2) Die Hard on a Bridge, I mean you can literally apply it to anything like Die Hard on dog crap and it will work.

","3.5/4<br/><br/>Die Hard is a movie about a cop named John McClane who has to rescue his wife and many other victims who have been taken hostage by a group of terrorist during a Christmas party. Now this movie really establishes how to do a action thriller. The characters are well developed, there's a very convincing villain and of course there's much action and many thrills.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis does his character well and I guess you could say actually becomes the character his role is so convincing. What's so great about this is hes a very relatable character who isn't like Arnold who can do impossible things with a gun. This character is all about trying to relate to the audience and what they would do in those certain situations. Some parts he's cracking jokes and some he's dramatic and terrified.<br/><br/>Many action movies are over the top and are made to thrill us and keep us in awe. That's what John Woo's film The Killer establishes later on but this film is very realistic to human instincts. Most movies only center around the action but I believe this one was really focused around John Mcclain.<br/><br/>Die Hard is a very good action flick that has an extremely interesting character as its foundation."
"bkrauser-81-311064","9","2","3","6 February 2014"," The Grand, the Amazing, the Original Die Hard
","NYPD cop John McClane (Bruce Willis) has been having a bad day. Not only is he at a Christmas party for a bunch of corporate nitwits and not only did his attempt at reconcilement with his estrange wife (Bonnie Bedelia) not work, now he has to deal with a Euro-trash terrorists who have taken everyone but himself hostage. To make matters worse, he's in Los Angeles for the holidays; Merry Christmas. That in a nutshell is what Die Hard (1988) is all about, one ordinary guy put in an extraordinary circumstance, making the best of a bad situation and picking off the bad guys, one guy at a time.<br/><br/>Yet that simplicity, that clear-cut, no B.S. approach to unrecompensed violence and explosions is exactly what makes Die Hard so appealing. It's a culture piece, an ambassador of action-thrillers meant to make the pulse quicken. Not just a standard of hostage film excellence but the only standard there is.<br/><br/>Surprisingly enough, no one had ever thought of making a movie like Die Hard before 1988. There were smatterings of the idea in American westerns like The Silver Lode (1954) and police procedurals like The Dirty Harry movies (1971-1988). The screenplay for Die Hard is based on the novel Nothing Lasts Forever by Roderick Thorp so it's not like an elongated hostage situation is unheard of in literature. But it wasn't until director John McTiernan and writers Jeb Stuart and Steven E. de Souza put their collective talents together did something like Die Hard truly pop into existence.<br/><br/>The tropes introduced in Die Hard would later become imperious parts of action-movie mayhem. A running joke in Hollywood is using Die hard as a common descriptor for screenwriters to get their products produced. ""It's like Die Hard only on a bus,"" brought us Speed (1994). ""It's like Die Hard but in Alcatraz,"" gave us The Rock (1996) ""It's like Die Hard only on a battleship/train,"" got us Under Siege (1992) and Under Siege 2: Dark Territory (1995). Very few movies can lend themselves to a rhetoric trick of this kind so easily.<br/><br/>After the films release Bruce Willis, who had mostly done comedy, rocketed to action icon status. He exemplified a new kind of hero, one with frailties and fears, who occasionally freaked out and was limited. Bruce Willis's John McClane was not a muscular tough man like Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jean-Claude Van Damme. He was a leaner, smarter, everyman kind of guy who wasn't above getting glass stuck in his bare feet. Later versions of John McClane in the sequels would have him saving entire cities, surviving helicopter crashes, jumping on trucks and jets, ship explosions; car chases, and Justin Long. Yet the original John McClane is and will remain a symbol of cowboy weltanschauung with a lack of pretension. ""Yippie-ki-yay, m*****f*****."""

","This gets better every Christmas and I predict no stop to it. It works so well I believe one day film students will be forced to study the effect beyond the cultural just like they now study Hawks and Hitchcock. Some groundwork here for future readings.<br/><br/>Willis had charm of a similar sort to Wayne, empty swag and unable to act. The story derives from a western mentality anyway. We have a couple drifting apart and the situation that brings them close again, but this isn't really a main driving force in the story. Neither Willis nor his wife are directed to convey much anxiety about their reuniting, we can logically assume it but it's not a palpable tension in the film. The movie is his macho dream to destroy that corporate life that has taken his wife from him; the Japanese boss who he didn't prevent being shot, the annoying Ellis character who puzzlingly doesn't give him up as the husband, the whole building that he tears apart, Willis unclasping her rollex in the climax and with it corporate, money-driven Hans Gruber tumbles down.<br/><br/>More interesting is that all this is wrapped in the usual Christmas fantasy about family, but for the fact that it's not the usual one. The usual one would begin after the movie ends as their kids who had gone to bed that night with an estranged father on the other side of the country wake up to find their parents together again. It's the same cinematic leanness that makes Christmas a faint background instead of bending every edge to it like most Christmas films do, probably inspired by the low-key approach of Lethal Weapon. <br/><br/>This brings me to another point. It really has little action compared to what we have now in superhero stuff. Preparations take up much more screen time than gunplay. Of course at the time it didn't seem so, which is why now the effect is beginning to surface with some clarity. We don't need to have whole fabrics of world torn up for it to be intense, it derives from the situation and is punctuated by bursts of action in very clearly defined cinematic space. Up and down, in and out. Economic use of space. The rooftop climax is a great example, we don't have endless shooting and a storm of fractured image; McClane gets there fires a machinegun burst in the air, an explosion throws him off the edge, he smashes in through the windows below. <br/><br/>Lethal Weapon was liberal, this is conservative. That one inspired by noir, this one by westerns. Briggs and Murtaugh are frayed and flummoxed in earnest by the world, McClane coolly stands above it, alone and charred only on the outside. What kind of guy are you?"

Whilst McClane is refreshing himself from the flight in one of the Nakatomi Plaza's corporate rooms, a group of terrorists seize the building. <br/><br/>Alan Rickman plays as the villain Hans Gruber, in one of his best screen performances he has played. Hans Gruber is the leader of this terrorist group, but he is no ordinary villain. On screen he comes across as a master criminal with great intelligence. His calm demeanour and well thought out plotting of the heist shine greatly throughout this movie. <br/><br/>I will not go through the story itself, but all I will say is that throughout the film, the screenplay, action scenes, and story in general play out perfectly. It has masterfully executed effects, and a pile-driver steady pace throughout, culminating in one of the greatest action films to ever hit the screens.<br/><br/>--------------------------------------------- <br/><br/>Die Hard cemented itself as one of the all time greats with its release in the late 80's, around a time that action films were at its peak, with the likes of Schwarzenegger and Stallone pumping out their own respected films. With Bruce Willis's performance throughout the film, I feel this was his breaking point which helped him be known as part of the 'Big Three'.(Arnie, Stallone, Willis.)<br/><br/>Anyone who has not yet seen this film should definitely give this a watch as soon as possible!

It works so well because the situation is plausible, McClane has skill and knowledge (as a police officer) and he gets beat up, shot, cut, bruised, burned and more. He doesn't do a Rambo, but hides in the shadows just mucking with the bad guys plans often enough to really tick 'em off!

Even Argyle the limo driver (I don't remember the actor's name) who looks like an obnoxious stereotype character at first turns out likable and even memorable. Behind the camera we've got John McTiernan whom had only directed the cult classic ""Predator"" and does an absolutely flawless job in the director's chair. The action is wonderfully gritty and realistic which is helped a lot by the refreshing vulnerability of the hero. He gets the crap beat out of him and he bleeds! Not to mention that this is maybe the most well paced film I have ever seen.

"johnnyboyz","10","2","3","17 May 2010"," Tough and resilient, like its lead; the sort of smart and grounded American action/adventure film that the current filmic climate is devoid of.
","People bicker, argue and disagree with one another in Die Hard like nobody's business: the police with the police; the police with the F.B.I.; the F.B.I. with local power company employees; the terrorists with each another; one hostage is rightly reluctant for another to make his presence known, and yet at the heart of it is the action lead in lieutenant John McLane's calm and methodical relationship over a two-way radio with a certain police officer named Al Powell. Amidst all the chaos and panic, two guys, one of whom is on the front line, are keeping their cool and we connect with them intricately on that very basic level as this masterful piece of work weaves down chaotic and anger-filled routes.<br/><br/>Die Hard might very well be the greatest action film of all time, the best of its genre; a chess match in a three or so dozen storey tall building in which cat and mouse and all things substantial linked to revising what traits it is the action film 'ought' to resemble are played out. The sequence in which its revisionist tendencies reach somewhat of a peak is the instance that sees its rugged lead leap off the roof of said building with a fire-hose tied around his waist, just after saying a little prayer. The lead could plunge to his death; he presence is not as required to drive the film as much as it was required earlier on – the police have arrived and settling down into a groove of exchanges and gun battles with the enemies within as a war is waged and could feasibly just play out. McLane is superfluous to proceedings, save a sub-plot that opens up to do with his wife which might be foiled by anyone of a righteous nature in the film.<br/><br/>It's a superb set piece, dramatic and enthralling in its systematic execution of taking into account McLane's own personal safety with the F.B.I. chopper buzzing overhead with an old fashioned 'race against time' premise to proceedings as those with the power eventually agree to set off a number of explosives located in the vicinity. There is heart, peril and raw fear in McLane's voice and actions; items not synonymous with action film leads. The film of course covers the exploits of Bruce Willis' lieutenant McLane, a New York policeman that touches down in L.A. at Christmas time in order to meet with his wife with whom he has a strenuous relationship. The emphasis on McLane as someone out of his depth is playfully toyed with early on, his observing of erratic-to-him behaviour at the airport as a woman leaps into the arms of newly arrived boyfriend spawns a murmured expletive followed by ""California(!)"", as does an incidence later on when a drunk male party guest kisses McLane on the cheek. We feel McLane is out of his depth, he trudges through the reception area of the building to a low angle capturing the power the place will eventually come to have over him as his footsteps echo eerily throughout the foyer.<br/><br/>His wife is Holly (Bedelia), a strong woman; who's better off in life than her husband with a great job plus prospects in a field usually dominated by the male and more than a match for the terrorists at various times whom have seized control. You may ultimately read into the film as a 'test' for McLane to win Holly back as a marital partner: the symbolic releasing of a gold watch, which was a gift earlier on from a potentially new suitor, during the climax is the ultimate act that wins through in the end and confirms a succession of McLane's goals. The leader of the terrorists that take over the building during a Christmas party is Alan Rickman's Hans Gruber, a man it's established has loved the idea of painstaking process in the meticulous detailing of something from a very early age - it appears he's taken great care in manufacturing the robbery of the high-rise. His first lieutenant is Karl (Godunov), who it's established is himself an unhinged individual when he risks his own life early on by sawing through some electrical pylons as his brother below struggles to cut the correct wires in time. The cat and mouse exchanges between Karl and John for the first twenty or so minutes are dramatically involving; wonderfully constructed and thrilling as special attention to the skyscraper as a space complete with its own tunnels and corridors is observed.<br/><br/>Die Hard's attitudes to the action genre in terms of conflict is highlighted in two sequences, the first being that McLane is quick to avoid conflict; evading and even stopping mid sentence whilst on the two-way so as to check his surroundings to make sure it's safe. Incidentally, he uses his firearm to shoot off locks; break windows so as to enter; 'frighten' hostages into moving to a safer zone and to stop a large fan from rotating so he may pass. The gun is rendered a tool during these sequences, not a mere item used to shoot, blow stuff up and advance action. The second is when the police initially establish themselves outside and charge in on first sight, in what is an event more typically associated in furthering action and conflict and the sort of sequence a lesser film of the genre would solely rely on. The film is aware of this; having its lead, himself embodying many antithetical traits to the typical action lead, comment on proceedings by labelling them ""macho a**holes"". Their efficient and brutal demise is systematic of the film's overall attitudes to its genre and these actions. There are barely more than a few seconds in Die Hard that don't work, the sort of high octane American feature film you rarely get nowadays in a world flooded with genre hybridising; big budgeted flops; daft star systems; merchandising and the incessant need to leave room for sequels. How unfortunate."

","Bruce Willis plays John McClane, a swaggering New York cop who arrives in LA to patch things up with his wife, Holly (Bonnie Bedelia, who would be sorely missed in the second sequel). Unfortunately, Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) has also come to town. He takes Holly and her work colleagues hostage on the 30th floor in a bid to bide time while his goons break into the vault to steal 600 million dollars in bearer bonds. McClane, meanwhile, is loose amongst the building's lift shafts and air vents, picking off Gruber's men with a pistol and a one-liner.<br/><br/>Let's leave aside the Nakatomi Plaza's phallic presence (complete with climactic rooftop explosion) and concentrate on the people in it. John McClane: he's the sort of action hero who can chain smoke filterless European cigarettes before sprinting up four flights of stairs, having a fist fight and then leaping off a 40-storey building with a fire hose wrapped round his waist. Gruber, paradoxically, and yet strangely likewise, is precisely who we would want to be if we were a ruthless global criminal: suave, literate, deadly; an ""exceptional thief"".<br/><br/>Events build up and up until we have a proper cat-and-mouse story. The odds are stacked against McClane: he's outnumbered, out-gunned, and out-shoed. But he's also a resilient fellow - a stubborn working man stuck in his ways - and he doesn't care much for foreign types trespassing on the ranch. For all the incredulity of many of our hero's actions, he is an everyman; forget juggernauts versus jet fighters - this incarnation of McClane huffs and puffs and bleeds. It HURTS jumping off a building, and he's modern enough to show it.<br/><br/>Along the way we meet some neatly written side characters, most of whom belong to the bumbling good guys. Deputy Police Chief Dwayne T. Robinson (Paul Gleason) is scoping for promotion; journalist Richard Thornburg (the hilarious William Atherton, effectively reprising his role from Ghost Busters) sniffs a Pulitzer; and FBI agents Johnson and Johnson (Robert Davi and Grand L. Bush) just want to chew gum and get the job done with acceptable hostage losses.<br/><br/>McTiernan is a peerless action director when he's on form (see also Predator and Die Hard With a Vengeance), and this is his pinnacle, harking from the days when stunts meant stunts, not green-screen. Thumbs-up to cinematographer Jan de Bont, too, for proving that his best work is done on another director's leash. And Michael Kamen's score - foreboding and triumphant in equal measures - is so good it barely changed a note for three movies."

There is also a hostages, LAPD, FBI and journalists who seems to have nothing else to do but to disturb McClane. All of them gather to celebrate Christmas Eve with an explosion. This is probably one of the best American action movies. Like in The Terminator all the action is delivered very qualitatively. Bruce Willis is so amazing that if I had to choose which movie star I wanna be, I would probably choose him."

","This movie is on my top 10 list. I want to comment on a scene I think most people aren't aware of. A fun trivia fact is when the people on the plane get ready to leave and the stewardess (Stella Hall) bumps into John, this was a setup by the crew. His reaction to her is genuine and unrehearsed because it wasn't a part of the script. She was planted in the scene as a prank to Willis because she looked so much like Demi Moore and his reaction was, in fact, he was shocked at first and then realized it wasn't her! After all, for those of us that travel a lot, the stewardesses do not walk down the aisles especially when everyone is trying to leave..........DUH!"

","""Die Hard"" is a great movie, the action scenes are amazing, the swearing is awesome, Bruce willis is fantastic but most of all it's possibly the best action movie ever made. I mean it's just plain out fun to watch. The plot's pretty good, and the characters are decent. I first watched ""Die Hard"" when I was six and now I'm thirteen and I've probably scene it at least six to ten times. It's also a classic movie. The film's about a New York cop who goes to L.A. to see his work-addicted wife and kids on Christmas. But instead of candy canes and a bang his wife and her colleagues get kidnapped and he tries to save them!!!!! I'd recommend it to anyone who likes good action movies, good action scenes, and a lot of swearing!!!!!!!!!"
"PeterWilliamson","10","2","3","10 December 2007"," A Movie That Will Remain An All Time Classic
","This, being the original Die Hard, will become the next ""all time classic"" but of a different genre to what is usually taking this title. Definitely the best and most original classic action movie ever made and a must see to any movie buff or action lover and with out a doubt the best Die Hard of the three sequels. This will remain to be one of my all time favourite movies.<br/><br/>John McLane (Bruce Willis) is the New York cop whose visiting the Nakatomi building in Las Angeleas (his wife, Holly Genero's work office). John's traveling here for Christmas to see his wife and kids, thinking he will see his wife Holly McLane to find out she's using her madden name, Genero. He hasn't spoken to his kids yet, he's not planning to stay in the same house as Holly but still discusses it. Then the action starts when he's arrived at the building, talking to his wife before he is left alone while she is called down to make a speech. This is when the John McLane trademark starts, the famous way he talks to him self.<br/><br/>The main storyline begins while he's talking to him self and Holly's making a speech, a group of terrorists take over the building. Alan Rickman plays the famous terrorist leader, Hans Gruber, Hans leads organizes under ten more terrorists to take over the only floor still populated in the Nakatomi building, where they are having a Christmas party. While his men are securing all the hostages on the floor and going up to each individual room John is just able to escape through to the exit (fire emergency) stairs. His famous barefoot attempt of survival is shown through out the rest of the movie absolutely timeless lines and hilarious wise cracks.<br/><br/>I recommend this to anyone who can handle the odd gun shot and swear word. 9.5 out of 10"

","The reason why this is one of the most popular action movies of all time is because it is one of the best. Not only that, but the movie has cross-over appeal. The movie makes most action lovers top films lists, and even many people who aren't big action movie fans like it.<br/><br/>The acting is top notch for the genre. Bruce Willis plays the part of badass cop John McClane perfectly. Although there are literally millions of gunshots in this movie, Willis is forced to use his brain just as much as, if not more, than he uses his gun here. The terrorists are played very well, too, led by Alan Rickman, who was perfect for the part of Hans Gruber.<br/><br/>All of the action scenes are well handled. There are moments of drama and humor in the film as well, and they are placed perfectly. All the parts fall into place very well.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this movie, I recommend you see it as soon as possible. It is easily one of the best action movies of all time."
"MaxBorg89","9","2","3","12 June 2007"," Action movies don't come much better than this
","It's been nineteen years since Die Hard was first released, and after three films (with a fourth coming out in a couple of weeks) and countless spoofs or rip-offs, John McClane (Bruce Willis) and his catchphrase (""Yippee-ki-yay, motherf**ker!"") have lost none of their charm. Why? Probably because when the first movie showed up in 1988, McClane stood out as a normal guy, as opposed to the various Rambos and Terminators that kept invading the screens. He was an ordinary man in an extraordinary situation (think Jack Bauer's elder brother), and that's what's helped cement his status as one of the most enduring action heroes of all time.<br/><br/>The franchise-opener (and arguably the best of the three) sees Willis' police officer trapped in a huge building (the Nakatomi Towers) where his wife (Bonnie Bedelia) and several other people are being held hostage by German criminal Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) and his team. The situation looks hopeless, unless someone decides to take down the terrorists one by one. And given the lack of more suitable ""heroes"", it seems like McClane will have to do it.<br/><br/>The character's popularity is indelibly linked to his vulnerability: unlike Sylvester Stallone or Arnold Schwarzenegger, who walked out of their movies with no scratches and a pack of dead bodies behind them, Willis leaves the scene bruised and battered (in one installment, he even gets to say: ""It looks so easy in the movies!""), even though the body count remains very high. Another thing that sets him apart from his predecessors is his verbosity: whereas Arnie and Sly killed without as much as whispering, McClane keeps on talking, using quick wit and effective curses to comment on his bad situation. This spawns some of the funniest dialogue ever heard in an action movie, such as when the protagonist offs a bad guy from under a table (""Next time you have a chance to kill someone, don't hesitate"" ""Thanks for the advice"") or tries to contact the police (""Attention, whoever you are. This channel is reserved for emergency calls only..."" ""No f**king sh*t, lady! Do I sound like I'm ordering a pizza?""), and also provides the opportunity for some unseen hero/villain interaction, as Gruber (played by a spot-on Rickman) fakes an American accent and tries to con McClane, only to realize his opponent is no fool and the two start chatting about their conflicting moral values or views on American culture (Gruber: ""This time John Wayne does not walk off into the sunset with Grace Kelly"" McClane: ""That was Gary Cooper, a**hole!"").<br/><br/>Also essential in securing this film's success is the claustrophobic setting: while most films tend to drag their characters from one place to another, Die Hard works because the action takes place in one location for the entire running time (an element that was borrowed from Greek drama), adding plenty to the suspense and creative solutions the leading man has to come up with to survive the day.<br/><br/>Back in the '80s, this film was great because Bruce Willis was the anti-Rambo. Now, in the age of Neo, Spider-Man and Harry Potter, it seems only fitting that cinemas will be graced with the return of John McClane, a normal dude against the superhuman majority. Time to dust off the T-shirt, get a gun and be prepared to pronounce that immortal line once again."
"jfcthejock","8","2","3","11 May 2007"," One The Greatest Action Flicks of All Time!
","What can you say, Die Hard is responsible partly for most of the action films of the early 1990's and onwards. Yes there was ROBOCOP and TERMINATOR, and they too contributed to creating the ACTION fad! Where ever you look nowadays you can't find a decent action movie, I mean Smoking Aces was alright but Spiderman 3 was a let down.<br/><br/>I remember seeing this film as far back as when I was only seven or eight, and it blew my mind. I later bought in on VHS, burnt through it with over watching it till eventually it was released on DVD and I bought it again. Die Hard didn't break any conventions of past action films, but rather re-invents the macho one-liners and the extreme action scenes. In my view, we have the likes of Transporter, Crank and even Man on Fire simply because of DIE HARD!<br/><br/>Disagree with me, I don't care! It's my opinion, I seriously recommend Die Hard to any Action fan hands down!"

This film is so good not only because of the mind blowing action scenes, not only because of the hilarious one liners, but because of the character's relationships with each other. I could not imagine a better person to play 'John McClane' than Bruce Willis. He has the tough guy feel, but as the movie progresses we see a softer side to him especially at the start with his ex. Alan Rickman is a great baddie because he does not over do it, his cold eyes and soft menacing tone are more than enough to convince you this guy is pure, ruthless evil. This film is amazing, if you have not seen it - do so."
"robb_772","8","2","3","28 July 2006"," Action classic
","Hands down, one of the most influential contemporary action films of it's era, DIE HARD is a white-knuckle thrill ride that almost single-handedly redefined the genre and inspired a whole slew of imitators and sequels – none of which can even close to matching the impact of the original. The film also sent star Bruce Willis into the stratosphere of success, which had both positive and negative ramifications. One of the main reasons that Willis is so effective in this film is because he represents an action hero who is also very much an everyman, a quality that has been diminished since Willis was catapulted to Hollywood's A-list. While I find much of his subsequent performances to be cloying and self-congratulatory, there is no denying that Willis is absolutely perfect here as DIE HARD'S brittle, wisecracking protagonist.<br/><br/>Jeb Stuart's screenplay is brilliant in it's fundamental simplicity, and Stuart's dialogue impressively manages to remain witty without crossing the line into unbearable camp. Director John McTiernan wisely does not attempt to elaborate on simple premise of Roderick Thorp's original novel, yet he does manage to effectively pull out every stop and maintain a fever-pitch of intensity throughout the entire proceedings. In addition to delivering the aforementioned career-best performance from Willis, McTiernan also gets solid work from Bonnie Bedelia and Alan Rickman, who proves true the old cliché that a thrill-inducing action yarn is only as good as it's villain. A towering, suspenseful, humorous, and exhilarating picture, DIE HARD is unquestionably a significant benchmark for the action genre."
"ray-280","10","2","3","8 February 2006"," Amazingly Human Action Film
","Fresh off Rambo and the Terminator's superhuman exploits, Bruce Willis gives us John McClane, an everyman cop from New York on vacation for the holidays and an office Christmas party date with his half-estranged wife, Holly (Bonnie Bedelia). Holly has taken a high-level corporate job with a Japanese conglomerate, and the movie hints at her having one foot in her marriage, and the other planting more and more firmly in the world around her. The only notables among the supporting cast are Paul Gleason (Dwayne T. Robinson, Deputy Police Chief) and William Atherton (Richard Thornburg, Channel 5 Reporter).<br/><br/>The danger comes out of nowhere: a group of international criminals led by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman), and claiming to be terrorists, catches the company napping, taking over the building tower with ease on Christmas Eve, their sights set firmly on $600 million in bearer bonds that are neatly tucked away in their vault. The criminals had expected to just do their thing, get their money, and get out, but John decides to be a ""fly in the ointment"" and put the hostages at risk as he takes the bad guys out one by one. Only Sgt. Al Powell of the LAPD (Reginald VelJohnson) believes John, and then only after he gets ""irrefutable"" evidence of the criminals' existence landing on the hood of his car. From then on, Al, John, and Hans dominate the film from the three perspectives (good guys at the scene and with the hostages, and the bad guy). Holly is reduced to a supporting character but her presence is always in John's mind, restricting his ability to act since he can't harm her.<br/><br/>What makes Die Hard the all-time classic it has rightfully become was the lack of extravagance and fantasy: there were no decades-old war grudges, no jungle action, no superhuman powers and only the occasional physics-defying stunts we are usually overloaded with. The characters in this film were regular people, with regular jobs and regular attitudes, confronted with an extraordinary situation, responding as most regular people would, by doing things which go beyond what they would ""regularly"" consider. Each character's backstory is one that could easily be ours if we were born in their shoes, and we all know at least one or two people like someone from the film. These are the people we live with, work with, and interact with, and the film captured them perfectly. This realism makes it very easy for the audience to believe that it too could have been caught at that party and had to face the situation.<br/><br/>Die Hard took the action genre in a new direction, adding a human touch and bit of reluctance to their invulnerability, while also showing them (as Spider Man would do so as well later on) as people who are much better at making others' personal lives work out than they are with their own.<br/><br/>Even if you haven't seen Die Hard, you've seen its legacy in many other films since. The formula was a brilliant one, and this was its birth."

It isn't that I think this movie is on the same level as something like Dr. Strangelove, or Roshomon, but it certainly isn't worse. I just feel that you can't compare these movies to each other. This film is completely successful in delivering what I would ask for in an action film.<br/><br/>What are those criteria? Good story, likable hero, few plot holes, and a superb bad guy.<br/><br/>Alan Rickman deserves MASSIVE praise for his role in this film. Without him or Bruce Willis, this film doesn't work. I would even argue that he was more important. I base that on the sequels to this film. He is so amoral, deceitful, cunning, and charismatic, that I don't think he has been topped as an action movie bad guy.<br/><br/>An example as to the genius of this film. My sister's favorite movie for a short time, only to be re-replaced by Die Hard, was Speed. Now I've also seen that movie more times than I would care to admit, but the more times I watched it, the more I noticed about it that was totally ridiculous. It ended up being a game of ""spot the inconsistencies.""

","Die Hard is the movie that redefined action movies! Think about it, have you seen any serious action movie (if that makes sense) since that doesn't imitate Die Hard in some way? The mould was truly broken after this one! Bruce Willis was a comedian before this movie and now when you think wise-ass ballbreaker, you think Bruce Willis. This is the movie that made Willis. His performance as John McClane is awesome! McClane is a New York cop who has flown to LA one Christmas to make a last ditch attempt to patch things up with his estranged wife. When the building is taken over by terrorists, it's up to the hopelessly underprepared McClane to save the day! To counter McClane there is the calm collected villain Hans Gruber (masterfully portrayed by Alan Rickman), who refuses to take his eyes off of his objective.

"sandtkay2002","8","2","3","7 April 2005"," More than just a pretty face...
","Although slightly dated perhaps, but only perhaps, this movie will satisfy most people looking for an action film with a solid, edgy, story. Willis has a good track record for picking exactly that combination, hence his success. But that is not the reason for these remarks. I direct your attention to a scene in the movie on an elevator when our hero is confronted with one of the baddest of the bad guys in the movie. It's here that you see that the man can act, that he is more than an appealing action hero, that the casting agents over the years weren't taking the easy way out, that he can contribute more to a project than just his wry smiling persona. The scene I'm referring to could have easily been an overplayed feeling of mental torture, but it was more of a controlled torture, it was barely concealed anguish in its most subtle, but absolutely clear human form. It was an anguished conversation where the anguish could not be revealed, so as to not put the character in the story at risk. But somehow it was there for the audience to see and appreciate, maybe because the viewer knows any normal person would have felt that way under the circumstances. In fact, he spent much of the film terrified WHILE ALSO being determined. Die Hard was exactly that, a prolonged variation from the scene on the elevator and a combination of emotions that when well acted, are compelling, captivating, and when played out with someone like Willis and the well crafted action material that he often does for movies, is absolutely entertaining."
"Spondonman","8","2","3","19 December 2004"," An uplifting experience with dirty vests
","Die Hard is a marvellous 80's film, I can't say that for many of that decade... thinking of this one I can't think of another as good. It turned out to be Willis's magnum opus, and a severe case of type-casting developed afterwards for him.<br/><br/>I suppose I watch it nearly every time it's on TV (so far always UK ITV), does that make me a die-hard Die Hard viewer? ITV always muck about with it, editing the violence or swearing, or like last night both simply to squeeze the end in before midnight! I'm not one for violence depicted in modern day films, ie since 1954, but I think it's ridiculous nowadays to part edit a film for timings, especially one a shed-load of viewers will have seen over and over again! They think: screw them, their memories will have to compensate for all the missing bits, we have to get to the adverts on time.<br/><br/>The film flows effortlessly, and easily makes you swallow all the stereotypes and (mainly Christmas) corn it doles out along the way. The portrayal of the arrogant deputy and FBI men make me cringe a bit, especially post 9/11, but as they're pivotal in holding our interest in the events outside the building must be endured.<br/><br/>It's a pity DH2/3 were so poor in comparison, maybe if they'd had another emergency in the Nakatomi Towers it would have worked better! After all, the building itself was the biggest star in the movie!"

They had to be real people with families that were there for more than just window dressing.

Before this was Lethal Weapon, Predator, Robocop, The Terminator and Alien. Yet none of these had amazing explosions like in Die Hard. Them movies just had gunfights at twenty yards and car chases. Die Hard builds up the tension amazingly well and the movie is constantly keeping you up to date with John McClane and the terrorists. The brilliant explosions like the one down the elevator shaft, like the rooftop one. The brilliant shootout between John McClane and Karl and Hans. The brilliant stunt (no computer) where John McClane jumps off the roof. Or the clever ending. This is my favorite film ever and I have got the Two Disc Special Edition DVD.

","Die Hard sets the benchmark for all action movies today.  This film also made Bruce Willis an international star.  It is a shame to see the ""Die Hard"" plot being recycled into other movies.  Even the two sequels cannot match the original.<br/><br/>For those that have been living under a rock for the past several years, Bruce Willis is New York Police Detective John Mc Clane, who flies to Los Angeles to visit his estranged wife during Christmas.  However, at his wife's party, German terrorists led by the intelligent and chilling Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman), take over the building and hold Mc Clane's wife, her boss and other co-workers hostage, and scheme to steal $600 million locked in a safe in the building.  Mc Clane manages to escape with his handgun, wit and determination, and decides to wage a one-man war on the terrorists and save his wife and the other hostages, and must compete with the supposedly incompetent LAPD and FBI handling the situation from outside.<br/><br/>Memorable crackling one-liners, perfectly choreographed action sequences, an original plot, and brief moments of humour make ""Die Hard"" an excellent action movie and one of my favourite movies of all time. <br/><br/>

","I saw 'Die Hard' in the cinema when it first came out (which dates me, I know), and just watched it on DVD for probably the first time since. What surprised me was the fact that it hardly felt dated at all: the biggest giveaway that it was an 80s movie was the use of a Japanese corporation as the site of the terrorist attack.<br/><br/>This movie is certainly Bruce Willis' finest hour, and Alan Rickman's performance as the villain is brilliant too. But what really makes it for me, in this era where action heroes like the Matrix mob and Lara Croft are totally invincible and, therefore, ultimately boring, is that Bruce Willis is most definitely, well, vincible. He's far from fashionably dressed, spending most of the movie in his vest with no shoes, rather than run into a room with six terrorists with machineguns and shoot them all in glorious, balletic slow motion he... valiantly runs away, he's cut and bruised and while he leaves trails of blood around the building, more often that not they're his own. Bruce Willis plays an action hero who can get hurt and regularly does: quite amazing by 21st century standards. And, better yet, he's not doing all this to save the world, but so he can have a quiet Christmas with his wife and kids!<br/><br/>Overall it's a whole lot of fun, with explosions, shootouts, a bunch of surprises, no dull spots, few unbelievable plot twists, good characters and a neat ending. After watching the movie it was interesting to imagine some of the other action heroes of the time trying to play Wills' role... what a screwup it would have been to have cast someone like Arnie or Stallone instead."

","Die Hard might as well be the only action film ever made.  It encompasses and surpasses every action film that came before it, and every action film that came afterwards is little more than footnotes to it. <br/><br/>
The peculiar sort of reality that Die Hard brings into existence so vividly and viscerally has been stretched, grown, shrunk, reflected, sped up, slowed down, and everything in between, but if you don't see the distinct footprint of Die Hard in everything from Men in Black to Brotherhood of the Wolf you just aren't looking hard enough.<br/><br/>Maybe, maybe Terminator 2 managed to carve itself out some territory with its alienating relentlessness and action-interpretation of the passage of generations, but inside the action movie genre, pretty much everything else that's familiar is in or from Die Hard.<br/><br/>It's a definite sign that this movie is essential to the culture and literature of film that it can be watched alongside any contemporary action movie without seeming muted or outdated, without seeming antiquated or technologically backward.  If Die Hard hadn't done the set pieces it had done, and some contemporary movie came along and did them, they'd still be considered brilliant and fresh.  Of course, if Die Hard hadn't done them, it is unlikely another action movie would have come along at all, and we'd still be stuck watching cops in suits squinting into the camera and the occasional spy movie or western to fulfill our action fix. <br/><br/>

Not only is it a gripping slice of suspense with many great set pieces and wonderful performances (yes, wonderful performances) by the cast that includes Bruce Willis, Alan Rickman, Bonnie Bedelia and Reginald Veljohnson, but it sets in stone many of the hallmarks that sixteen years later we all come to associate with big budget action movies. Action sequences involving machine guns and lots of destruction, check. A classy villain, check. The evil henchman with a hatred of the hero, check. A damsel in distress that has an emotional connection to the hero, in this case the wife, check. Lastly, a wise cracking hero that has a pun or a joke for every situation he gets out off, check. It's all here and would pave the way for two sequels (a third is in development) and action movies with the same motif. Only Die Hard does it so well. You can't accuse this film of being cliched, it created the cliches and they only became cliches when Arnie, Sly and Van Damme jumped on them.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis makes an endearing action hero. He isn't the action hero who can sustain anything and survive everything unscathed. The character of John McClane is not muscle bound killing machine. He is just a man wanting to get his marriage back on track and not, instead, be trying to survive being killed by German hostage takers. Willis succeeds in making McClane a likable character, his mild mannered delivery of his dialog and magnificent manner of delivering one liners is spot on and it's no surprise he became a huge movie star after this. Alas the film is stolen by Alan Rickman as Hans Gruber the villain who is clever, vicious (witness the killing of Takagi) and great, great fun. So entertaining is Rickman's performance that somewhere deep inside you kind of want him to win. The cold blooded nature of Hans when he kills Takagi (one of the most graphic murders I have seen in a mainstream film) and Ellis through to the sense of awe when he and his fellow crooks break the fault of the Nakatomi building makes Hans one of the best villains in a film and marks Rickman out as a great actor.<br/><br/>Director John McTiernan handles this all very well and has crafted a genuine classic action film which like The Matrix in later years, paved the way for a particular breed of action film. Spectacular, fun and gripping Die Hard is simply magnificent and sixteen years on is still a classic piece of the action genre.<br/><br/>Yippe-ky-yay!"
"Anaksunamen","10","2","3","5 January 2004"," A Kick-butt action Epic!!!
","I first became a fan of Bruce Willis when I first saw the fifth element. After that I went on a spree of watching films with him in them I next saw him in Blind date which I thought was also good, and when I saw him in Die Hard I thought wow! Willis sort of brought back his rough and tough exterior, great body, ruggedness and sexy NewYork accent( which is what he is like in real life. I like him because he is a rebel!whoo hoo!) which reminded me of his character in the fifth element I love it too! minus the cab of course His performance is awesome in this film it's the one that made him a star! The plot is excellent! This was an original film that set the standard for other action films that Hollywood has not been able to reach again. I loved all the characters, the guy from Family Matters is a cop in this film LOL!!! The Limo Driver who looks lke Erkle!! I loved the terrorist team especially Theo saying ""Oh My God The Quarterback is Toast!"""
"Jworld112","10","2","3","31 December 2003"," One of the best movies I've seen!
","Non-stop action.  Unlike some other action movies, there are no boring parts to ""wait through"" when watching it over and over and over again.  Bruce Willis is at his best in a well-written slice of pure excitement.  A must have for every collection of Guy Movies."
"mlshoe","10","2","3","28 December 2003"," Still Finding Little Details
","This is my all-time favorite action thriller. I usually hate the genre, actually, because it turns into pointless killing fests without a lot of reason or rationale behind the killings. But in this film, EVERY scene of violence is well thought out and advances the plot, leading John McClain closer and closer to the villains' real plan.<br/><br/>Even after countless viewings, I keep finding little details that I missed before. This film just ties everything together perfectly."
"aspr_4_eva","10","2","3","10 December 2003"," One of the top 10 action movies of all time.
","'Die Hard', starring Bruce Willis(Striking Distance, the Sixth Sense) and Alan Rickman(Truly, Madly, Deeply, Dogma) would easily make one of the top 10, possibly top 5 action movies of all time. Set in LA at a Christmas party in the Nakatomi Plaza, John McClane,(Willis) a cop from New York, comes to see his wife, Holly, at a Christmas Party held at her work. They get off to a shaky start, arguing about their relationship, when only moments later, a truck arrives, holding 12 terrorists in the back. The lead terrorist, Hans Gruber(Rickman) leads his group of fellow German Terrorists into the building where the Christmas party is being held. Once there, they take all of the party guests, (with the exception of McClane) hostage, and then declare war.<br/><br/>From here, it is up to John McClane to save the lives of the 30 or so hostages and overpower twelve dangerous and money hungry terrorists.<br/><br/> I can definitely say wothout a doubt that this is one of the greatest movies of all time and one of my personal favourites! Bruce Willis is fantastic as the good cop from New York who turns up at the party by mistake, but the real show-stealer is Alan Rickman, who delivers an absolutely brilliant performance as the relentless yet classy bad guy.<br/><br/> I definitely recommend Die Hard to anybody who likes edge of your chair suspense with some humour!!! 10/10!!!"

John Mcclane is a New York cop who turns up in the Nakatomi Building in Los Angeles to meet his wife who he hopes to spend Christmas with. But the party gets gatecrashed by terriorists led by their leader Hanns Gruber and takes 30 people hostage.

"grid212","10","2","3","9 November 2003"," Purely entertaining, re-watchable fun.
","It's interesting reading other people's reviews of Die Hard, both good and bad as to why this film is quite so successful. In many ways it comes down to the fact that this film (and its director John McTiernan) reinvented modern cinema as we know it in one hit. Never before did such a film sustain such a pace for so long, literally non-stop from start to finish the movie is perfectly paced leading from one crescendo to the next. With each plateau we are given a few short minutes to catch out breath, take stock then move on. J McT realised that a lot of the time it's the action sequences people love not the often unnecessary character development in-between - so why not try and make a movie that still had well developed characters, but at a much faster pace.<br/><br/> At the end of the day film for the most part is about rewarding it's viewers with something unimaginable and new, different to their daily lives (as with good fiction). Die Hard when it first exploded onto our screens in 1988 was just that. It's hard to imagine just how breathtaking this movie was now because there have not only been two sequels (to date) but also countless rip-offs and 'me too's'. Also for younger cinema audiences this movie is fast becoming 'retro', looking at the styles, themes and mood of the movie it's very much a film about its time (the late eighties). Rolex watches, limos, budgetless multi-national projects, barer bonds - there is a great sense of naivety possibly lost on younger audiences more used to computer crime and situations less tangible (the internet). Back then limos were only chartered by big corporations, Rolex watches really were a sign of status and guns the solution to all problems (as long as yours were bigger than theirs).<br/><br/> Times have changed however, less is more - everything is now high tech and the situation John McLain finds himself in is quite frankly laughable. As an example as a result of the phone lines being cut he resorts to taking on 11 would be terrorists, rescuing 30 hostages and his wife all because he can't phone 911. Today he'd probably have reached into is pocket and called for help on his mobile phone. Of course as you'll see it's not quite that easy, but even so the advent of mobile telecommunications does make a mockery of a lot of 80s movies. Back then having your phone lines cut in a movie meant two things; 1. there was no way to reach the outside world and this meant whomever cut them now had you prisoner in whichever building you were in at the time. 2. You were probably about to die, or dies trying to make your escape.<br/><br/> So why is this movie so good then? Well because in many ways it's comforting to watch. It's like sitting in  a comfortable sofa with a mug of warm tea on winter's night; outside it may be cold and windy but inside you have complete control of your environment.  Die Hard (without giving anything away for new watchers) concludes happily, the bad guys are really bad and the good guys are really good. In short you know where you stand and what to expect.<br/><br/>As a male, and like many other males I'm sure being honest about it when I first saw this movie I aspired to be like the hero. He's fearless, women love him and in the tightest of situations he retains his head and his sense of humour.<br/><br/>The movie is also endlessly entertaining I've watched it so many times now I've lost count - but I watch it again because there are still new things to spot, nuances perhaps I hadn't picked up on previously. But also because I know what I'm getting.<br/><br/> Okay so this movie doesn't make you think in quite the same way as perhaps 'better' more complicated movies do, but should it have to? It lacks the plot twists and sophistication of a lot of modern cinema certainly, it also lacks computer graphics and in my opinion that's no bad thing.<br/><br/> Die Hard is a straight-laced action movie and it's completely unashamed about that fact, I'd also add it pretty much invented this genre. But where more modern films have forgotten to include good characterisation and something resembling a story, this movie has both. Not only do we get to meet perhaps cinemas badest bad guy (Hans aka Alan Rickman) but also the then acting novice Bruce Willis as our hero.<br/><br/> If there's nothing on tv, or you feel like being ruthlessly entertained (but never having to question your own values) then this is harmless, entertaining, relentless fun. Not every movie in cinema needs to explicitly question contemporary society, it's values or ambition. Some films can simply entertain - Die Hard is the latter."

"PIST-OFF","8","2","3","12 May 1999"," Welcome to the comment pal!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
","When Die Hard came out Bruce willis was not an action star. That is what made this movie so good. If it were Arnold Shwarzenegger or Sylvester Stallone as the star this would have been just another standard bullet festival. Instead we got Bruce Willis and he rules in this movie. Plus Alan Rickman at his sleaziest best. Some people complain that the plot is impossible but who cares. There's good dialogue, great stunts, great special effects, and in my opinion the plot ain't half bad. How can you not love Bruce Willis's wise cracking cop under pressure. Plus the massive amounts of destruction done to the building are entertaining. My favorite part is when the cops move in with the RV. ""The quarterback is toast!"" So many good lines. Watch it with The Towering Inferno."

","""Die Hard"" is an excellent action film that delivers on almost all levels. NYPD cop Bruce Willis must try to stop terrorists from stealing millions from a Los Angeles skyscraper.

This film proved that Bruce Willis was a bank-able star on the silver screen. 4.5 out of 5 stars."

Especially if the recipient of the gift is a future director or screenwriter who is anxious to film a masterpiece that will last forever.

"hellraiser7","10","1","1","15 December 2019"," High Thrills and Hard to Kill
","One of the things I love about action films is just like with the suspense thrillers it plays with all the what ifs, where something that most likely wouldn't happen or are considered unthinkable does and from this two questions are asked, ""if ever put under the spot how would we deal with the situation?"" and ""is it possible to survive and win?""<br/><br/>This film is one of my favorite movies of all time, but also, it's my second favorite action film of all time. And of course, one of my favorite Christmas movies. I remember seeing this when I was an adolescent it blew me away, even today I still have lots of fun watching. Heck, even watching the trailer for this film is lots of fun, with that music going on and hearing some of that narrative from the late great Don Lamonte, he always had that great voice for ad narration and is something I sorely miss in trailers.<br/><br/>And this film wasn't just another 80's action film it was a phenomenon where this film has established itself as a subgenre in the action genre as many other films throughout the year and TV episodes have utilized the format like the movie ""Under Siege"" and the underrated ""Toy Soldiers"" but that's and many others are different stories. Even has a few video games, two of them are good like ""Die Hard Trilogy"" for PS1 and ""Die Hard Arcade"". There were even two pre sequel comics from Boom Studios based on John McClane that are surprisingly good. And even most recently a tabletop game that is cool.<br/><br/>I really love the plotline; from the way it's conducted it feels plausible; who's to say it can't happen or no criminal organization has every had this in the back of their minds.<br/><br/>The characters are great there are a lot of colorful characters.<br/><br/>Karl played by late and underrated actor Alexander Godunov whom is a solid subordinate villain as he is just throughout the film from beginning to end, hellbent in liquidating McClane. It's just interesting how as the film gets further along the more this guy's cool and sanity is just melting faster than the polar ice caps.<br/><br/>And of course, the late great Alan Rickman one of my favorite actors is great as Hans Gruber, this is one of my favorite roles from him and he's an honorable mention in favorite fictional villains. The Hans Gruber character isn't really a deep character as he's more of an archetypal villain but I think it was really in Alan's performance that makes him stand out, from the sharp German accent that you feel ever word could almost cut you like a knife.<br/><br/>He's a villain that is just constantly in control, much like a chess player he is a step or two ahead as he already has an elaborate plan in action. But he's very cold, calculating, and ruthless he isn't afraid to off anybody that gets in the way or tries to ruin his scheme. But also the guy has a dry charisma which means he's got some memorable lines and humor but in a different way, one line that makes me snicker is ""I read about them in Time magazine."" , I know small line but once you see the scene you'll know why it's funny.<br/><br/>Supporting characters are good like Officer Dwight whom is played by the late and underrated actor Paul Gleason. He's is someone you just love to dislike as he is pretty much that stereotypical jerk police chief whom we see is constantly trying to oversee the situation but it really not in charge of jack squat. What's funny about him is that he's practically a moron, but I do like that he at least tries to help despite not good at it.<br/><br/>And there is of course Sergeant Al Powell played well by Reginald VelJohnson, whom I always call the character Carl Winslow as that is that actors signature character from the TV show ""Family Matters"" as both characters are kind of the same. Anyway, really like how he really provides support for John by keeping him up to date on what's going on the ground as well as provide some intelligence from John about the perpetrators. But just like the back and forth between both of them which is touching and gives the film the buddy cop element, but here it's different because it's a long distance friendship; I thought that was cool because it's something different that don't see in that sub-genre.<br/><br/>But of course, it's the protagonist himself we love and are here for. Bruce Willis whom is an honorable mention in favorite actors in my book is great as John McClane, this is my favorite role from him, it's practically his signature role and John is sort of an honorable mention in favorite fictional heroes.<br/><br/>At the time he wasn't your typical or conventional action hero as he wasn't a man of muscle or not much muscle, let alone had the greatest set of fighting skills but that's part of why this action hero is great is because he's you everyday guy which made him somewhat relatable and shows how you don't have to be a man of muscle to kick ass.<br/><br/>One of the things this action hero has going for him is his sharp, witty, wise cracking charisma; this character just has lots of funny and memorable lines; he's much like Deadpool as he just keeps the jokes and lines coming. This in a way really helps in keeping his cool as well as being able to think straight under a highly stressful situation.<br/><br/>I even like how human the guy is as we get some depth into him, as we see his marriage is on the rocks and he's aware that he's not perfect that part of the reason is he fraked up a little, but he really does want to make things better you can say this situation was one hell of a way to do it. I also just like how he reacts to things which feel like how any ordinary person would react, really like how at times he talks to himself to help himself think, in those scenes the film is almost a one man show, one of my favorite quotes is ""Think God Damnit Think."" Yeah that what I always say whenever I have a certain dilemma I have to deal with.<br/><br/>Also, you see in some places how tired and slightly irritated mannerism as you can tell half the time he's thinking ""I don't want to do this, I really don't."", he didn't ask nor want to put himself in the action hero position as all he really wanted to do was the simplest thing spending Christmas with his family. But he has no choice so he pretty much rolls his eyes and goes with the role as no one else can do it, let alone his life and many others depend on it.<br/><br/>The action is well choregraphed, I like that it doesn't look too smooth which makes the film a bit realistic if you can believe that. You have some solid shootouts in the building like one that involves probably the biggest boardroom meeting table I've ever seen, which is kind of funny as it seems big enough to fit Congress. As well as a one on one fight which is one of my favorite one on ones of all time as both Karl and John are going at it, I liked the way it was done because it really felt realistic as it looked like real fighting. As a real fight wouldn't be perfectly choregraphed and there are no rules involved as both are fighting dirty.<br/><br/>And of course, the effects are great like the explosion which are practical there's no CGI bullcrap which makes them look beautiful. My favorite is of course the explosion of the third floor, when I saw, word will fail to describe this as you have to see it for yourself but seeing it, I thought ""Wow, John you nuked the building.""<br/><br/>Music is also great, there are plenty of memorable scores which create excitement and suspense. Even like the use of one famous Christmas song from Dean Martin in the end credits ""Let it Snow"" every time I hear that song, I can't help but think of this film.<br/><br/>What also makes this action film unique is the suspense from the physical situations of going from point A to B, surviving the firefights, and close calls in places that really put me on the edge of my seat.<br/><br/>But also, double layered and clever in what is revealed to us and not revealed. Where on one hand you are sometimes in the robber's shoes as you actually do want them to open that vault, but seeing their perspective actually helps make us at times part of the action because we actually are one step ahead of the protagonist. And the suspense is hopping the protagonist will be able to catch up on time, get a step ahead but also help fill in a blank or two because despite knowing most of Han's plans there is one part of it, we still don't understand.<br/><br/>Also, it's not just physical warfare but it's also a war of wits. Both John and Hans are both smart people, Han's heist plan and methodology is fool proof but the problem with him and the robbers is their thinking is inflexible and rigid because they never counted on an anomaly in the plan. John his intelligence might not be on the same level as Hans, as Hans stated he's had the finest education but good enough, because the thing about John is that his thinking is unorthodox, he is able to improvise and think on his feet literally.<br/><br/>Die Hard will blow you away and Merry Christmas.<br/><br/>Rating: 4 stars"

It's a race against time for John to stop the terrorists before it's too late.<br/><br/>The film is action packed, not non stop action as they're points where the film has character development scenes in it, which is fine as long as they don't drag on too much. Which they didn't thankfully, but yeah the film definitely doesn't disappoint in terms of action.<br/><br/>But to say this... IT'S NOT A CHRISTMAS FILM!!! Just because the film is centered around Christmas & has a couple of Christmas themed references in it, DOESN'T mean it's ABOUT Christmas!

"dworldeater","9","1","1","15 August 2019"," Classic action that made Bruce Willis an A list star
","Coming off of Predator, director John McTiernan was on a roll making a very different, but also an instant action classic with Die Hard. This movie also turned relatively unknown actor Bruce Willis into a big star instantly. Bruce was a different kind of action hero than Stallone or Schwarzenegger, being much more of an everyman than a jacked up killing machine. He plays a heavy duty cop caught in a building that is being taken over by terrorists that his wife is also held hostage by. This is really well done, nicely shot and put together. The story flows well with tons of great looking action scenes and explosions. The acting is also very solid with Bruce Willis truly rising to the occasion as leading man. Also, Alan Rickman gives a super strong cinematic debut as terrorist leader Hans Gruber, who is easily one of the best screen villains of all time. Hollywood tried copying this formula for years to come. I personally, don't like any of the sequels and the ripoffs like Speed, Cliffhanger and Con Air are pure crap in my opinion. But, Die Hard is really solid and really holds up. Essential action, an absolute classic."
"Wuchakk","7","1","1","19 March 2019"," Big, dumb, fun action flick with Bruce Willis and a skyscraper
","RELEASED IN 1988 and directed by John McTiernan, ""Die Hard"" is the first of (currently) five installments in the Die Hard series. In this one New York cop John McClane (Bruce Willis) flies to Los Angeles to spend Christmas with his wife & kids. When McClane visits Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) at her company's Christmas party a group of radical criminals take control of the skyscraper. Alan Rickman plays the nefarious mastermind of the operation while Reginald VelJohnson plays a cop on the ground that befriends McClane via walkie talkie. Meanwhile Paul Gleason is on hand as an exasperating police chief.<br/><br/>This franchise fills the bill if you're in the mood for big, dumb, fun action thrills. Don't get me wrong because a lot of work goes into making these kinds of films and it takes talent & genius to pull them off. I mean ""dumb"" in the sense that the focus is on unbelievable action rather than deeper themes beyond ""genuinely good people may be flawed, cocky and somewhat profane, but they're courageous and never give up in the face of evil.""<br/><br/>The Die Hard flicks are the natural progeny of over-the-top films like 1977's ""The Gauntlet"" where the action scenes are so overdone they're cartoony, but entertaining. There's a thin line that filmmakers must tread with these kinds of blockbusters because they can easily fall into overKILL, like 2001's ""The Mummy Returns."" Thankfully, ""Die Hard"" evades that ditch because it's not too over-the-top and it offers entertaining protagonists & antagonists, amusing one-liners, worthy bits of character development and a compelling comic booky story.<br/><br/>While all five Die Hard movies are of the same action expertise, I prefer the sequels because this one takes place almost entirely in and around a skyscraper. I favor the wider location scope of the others.<br/><br/>THE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours, 12 minutes and was shot entirely in Los Angeles.<br/><br/>GRADE: B/B+"
"dandersen-28039","10","1","1","5 January 2019"," DIE HARD
","The Pinnacle Of All Action Movies. Yippee Ki Yay !!!"
"bowmanblue","10","1","1","4 January 2019"," The greatest action movie (not to star Arnie)
","I've decided to leave a review for 'Die Hard' exactly thirty years since its release in 1988. Partly because it still holds up after all that time as one of the greatest action movies ever made and, secondly, because it has just (officially?) been classified as a 'Christmas movie.' So, does it promote festive cheer and goodwill to all men? Or does it just give you the manual on how to kill unlimited bad guys with a machine gun, a witty quip or two and dirty feet. Probably the latter really, but, for the record, it is SET at Christmas and a famous Christmas song even plays it out. What more do you need to pull a cracker and eat Xmas pudding to?<br/><br/>For anyone that doesn't know, the plot to 'Die Hard' involves a cop getting stuck in a giant building during a terrorist takeover. Guess what? He fights back. It's a simple plot and that's its main strength. It never really tries to be anything that its not. Bruce Willis may have been around before 1988, but it was no doubt that it was 'Die Hard' that cemented him as an 'A-list' star. Granted he's reprised his role as John McClane numerous times since, however one (of the many!) criticisms thrown at the sequels is that he's become a 'superhero' in human form, i.e. he can do anything and is completely invulnerable. But, back in the first outing, we really do feel his pain as he limps, crawls and drags his way through the building's air ducts in order to simply survive the night, let alone take out the entire squad.<br/><br/>In short, Bruce Willis was actually 'relatable' back then. But, what is a hero without a good villain? Not much. But luckily, as 'Die Hard' cemented Willis as an A-list protagonist, it also did the same for Alan Rickman as the dastardly terrorist leader, Hans Gruber. I read somewhere that the best films involving a clearly defined hero and villain explore the relationship between them (test it out - the movies that don't really work almost always have the hero and villain never meeting/interacting until the final showdown where the hero inevitably kills the villain). Here, the two spar not just physically, but mentally thanks to McClane stealing one of the terrorist's radios and mercilessly taunting Gruber as he dispatches one henchman after the next.<br/><br/>So, you have the relatable hero, the evil villain and the simple plot. What more could you want from an action movie? Well... action, maybe? And it's here tenfold. The wonderful thing about eighties action movies was that they were real. Or rather the special effects were really there on screen, rather than the actors filming up against a green screen and the explosions added later. All the fights here actually look like they could really happen. Yes, we always have to suspend our disbelief that one man shooting at a hundred has a better chance of killing them than the other way round (but then we've been doing that since James Bond first sipped his Martini!). But the action looks real and it's the final icing on this most unexpected Christmas cake.<br/><br/>Die Hard' may now be a Christmas movie, but you really can watch it any time you want a simple, yet excellent action film that really doesn't have many flaws (or at least none that detract from its brilliance). It really has been the template for many an inferior action movie to come. Yippie-kay-yah Christmas to you all!"
"theterminator-92378","10","1","1","28 December 2018"," The Best Action Movie Ever And Definitely A Christmas Movie
","Die Hard is 80s action movies in a nutshell but what Die Hard does is bring us a action packed story with Drama, Romance and gore and swearing obviously Bruce Willis cements himself as a action star alongside Sly and Arnie and out of all of the Die Hard movies this is the most solid in the series.
Die Hard follows NYPD detective John McClane on holiday to visit his distant wife who lives with there children in Los Angeles and when he arrives at a Christmas party at Nakatomi Plaza armed terrorists lead by the well dressed and well educated Hans Gruber he is a man with a plan and he will pull off the ultimate heist if it wasn't for the New York cop with a plan.
The superb cast is lead by leading man Bruce Willis who plays the hero cop John McClain he wasn't orginaly the first pick to play the part so i'm glad that they picked him he was absolutly perfect in this role. Reginald VelJohnson is another star he plays Sgt Al Powell A desk jockey cop who is the first cop to respond and the emotional and moral support of John and throughout he is the only one who cares about John and we also learn his story about how he shot a kid and he was never right after that and we can sympathise with his character. Another amazing talent is Bonnie Bedelia who plays Holly Gennaro McClane she is so badass standing up for herself and not being scared of Hans and his goons and she has a lot of faith in her husband to take out the terrorists and she uses her intellegence to keep herself alive and she is such a great character. I can't talk about Die Hard without talking about the main bad guy himself Hans Gruber played by the always amazing Alan Rickman he is just so amazing if you have seen Die Hard you know this guy needs no explaination of why he is great and he is one of the best movie villians of all time.
also in the cast is Paul Gleason {Deputy Police Chief Dwayne T. Robinson}, William Atherton {Richard Thornburg}, Hart Bochner {Harry Ellis}, James Shigeta {Joseph Yoshinobu Takagi}, Alexander Godunov {Karl},De'voreaux White {Argyle},Bruno Doyon {Franco} and Clarence Gilyard Jr. {Theo}.
What is there really to say about Die Hard it's a instant classic and spawned a whole franchise and other simular movies that are not as good as Die Hard is a movie that if you have not seen than you should it's a movie that everyone should watch around Christmas because it is a christmas movie and it's a great movie that you shouldn't miss out on watching and I would very strongly recomend this movie."
"loewleon","8","1","1","24 December 2018"," Oh god, Germany
","In Germany the movie had a huge censorship problem. The names were changed like Hans Gruber is John Gruber here, the terrorists are from east europe and not from Germany or the fact that the RAF was never mentioned. When you take these problems aside and watch the movie, like you always should, in its original language you will enjoy this great Action/Christmas Movie. It really started the big career of Bruce Willis, although it's been very silent about him in the last years. We see a fantastic Alsn Rickman and an Action Movie par excellence, with a hero whos more an average guy than a Stallone/ Schwarzenegger Hulk hybrid.<br/><br/>Die Hard and have a merry Christmas 2018<br/><br/>8/10"
"TheMovieDiorama","9","1","1","24 December 2018"," Die Hard explodes its way in becoming the pinnacle of action films.
","It isn't Christmas if you don't watch Die Hard. Yippee-kiyay motherfu...well, you know the rest. John McClane. Nakatomi Plaza. Hans Gruber. Twinkies. ""Let it snow, let it snow, let it snoooow"". McTiernan's near-masterpiece is the epitome of 80s action and truly sets the bar high for future action films. It evolves the genre to new levels by balancing drama and character development with memorable explosions and a slew of gunfire. McClane visits his wife on her Christmas work party, when a group of terrorists hold them hostage for a large sum of money. But McClane doesn't sit down and roll over. Oh no, in typical cowboy fashion he targets the enemy. Luring them to their demise. Bang. You just got ""McClaned"". ""Thanks for the advice"". This isn't just an action film, don't be fooled by its overwhelming praise. Although justified, this is also actually a well balanced crime thriller. Gripping dialogue between McClane and Gruber allows both characters to have infectious personalities. The former being this New York loud mouth with a ludicrous amount of quippy lines and the latter being the commanding antagonist that withholds a sense of compromise. Their interactions, or lack of, was tangible. Then the police department and FBI get involved, but the development doesn't stop there. In fact, it just ramps up with the action. Aside from Argyle, who is just an obvious plot convenience, all the characters have natural inclusion to the story. The action was explosive and surprisingly bloody, particularly the rooftop C4 explosion. McTiernan's direction was perfect, crafting a perfectly paced narrative. Packed to the brim with memorability, from its antagonist and his slow-motion demise (Rickman was an absolute legend) to the various quotable lines of dialogue. This is a near-perfect film, and one that deserves the acclaim it has garnered. With excellent performances to boot from Willis and Rickman, there really are a limited amount of flaws (in fact hardly any). Merry Christmas McClane, merry frickin' Christmas!"
"Danny_G13","10","1","1","17 December 2018"," About as good as action movies get outside James Cameron
","The movie which truly launched Bruce Willis' movie career and made him serious, Die Hard is quite simply a perfect slice of 80s Hollywood action, cheese, humour and bang for the buck.<br/><br/>Willis, as if you didn't know, is John McClane, arguably the most famous fictional cop of all time, up against maybe the most defining villain in Alan Rickman's Hans Gruber we've ever seen.<br/><br/>McClane is quite simply wrong man wrong place wrong time and yet right man right place right time and right result - a truly epic David v Goliath face-off where McClane, with his walkie talkie and Al at the other side, sees the viewer rooting for the little guys while the big bad guys appear untouchable.<br/><br/>Terrorists have taken over the Nakatomi Plaza in California, see, where McClane has gone to be with his wife following her move there from New York - and it doesn't take long before John is outwitting them wherever he can, aided by one of the most underrated performances in Hollywood history.<br/><br/>Willis manages to portray a good honest flawed man in a fine display of actual acting, while keeping himself going by sheer will and a touch of help from Al - and just keeps staying one step ahead of the terrorists.<br/><br/>But if we're praising Willis, Rickman's Gruber is just sensational - pure villainy, with great humour, incredible charisma and this movie launched Rickman as much as it did Willis. All the supports are great too, and the cheesy fun never outstays its welcome - the movie teases us a little with its intro, but the body out of the window onto Al's car might be one of the best ignition sequences in the history of movies. It's dynamite.<br/><br/>As is the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>A few tiny plot holes, sure, but who cares. It's as good as action gets without Cameron being involved - you will have an amazing blast with this superb yarn."

Bruce Willis delivers a strong performance too as John McClane.
Although this movie has more than its fair share of flaws, I'd recommend watching it at least once"
"4-Kane","Null","1","1","23 November 2018"," One of the all-time best action movies
","Bruce Willis did a fantastic job as John McClane, a New York City police officer who takes on a gang of terrorists when they take over a Los Angeles high-rise. Alan Rickman was great as the menacing leader of the gang, and the inevitable final showdown between him and McClane is clever. Not only is Die Hard one of the best action movies of all-time, but it is also one of the most influential ones. The movie was so successful that it spawned four sequels and numerous copycats, such as Passenger 57 and Under Siege; the former is basically Die Hard on a plane and the latter is Die Hard on a ship. You cannot be a fan of action movies without seeing Die Hard. Plain and simple."
"ChubbyChecker","9","1","1","9 September 2018"," Does it sound like I'm ordering a pizza?
","There's a reason why Bruce Willis is paid millions to make action films long after he should have retired from that sort of thing. This film is that reason.<br/><br/>The 1980s brought us some great action heroes. Arnie, Stallone and van Damme all churned out action films like there was no tomorrow and gave us some great entertainment. None of those actors were able to give us the charisma and everyman likeability that WIllis brought when playing McClane though. That is the reason why the Die Hard franchise is still loved today.<br/><br/>To think that Bruce Willis was only really known as a PI on a TV show (Moonlighting) and the fact that various actors were offered the role of McClane before him only makes his sky rocket to stardom all the more impressive. <br/><br/>As for the film itself, there is a certain raw simplicity in a cop stuck in a skyscraper with nothing but his wits and any guns he can steal from the bad guys that still resonates with audiences today. I defy anyone who says they are a fan of action films to not love Die Hard."
"SindarS","9","1","1","18 August 2018"," The classic of John McClane is having a really bad day
","In my opinion, this is the best movie in the 'Die Hard' series. It has become a classic shown around Christmas time, since the action in the movie takes place around this holiday.<br/><br/>When the NY police officer John McClane (played by Bruce Willis) lands in LA to visit his family, he has no idea that his day will turn into a nightmare where he will be outgunned and outmanned while trying to survive and trying to find his way out of this mess.
While the performance of Bruce Willis as John McClane didn't win him any awards, this should be considered as his iconic break-out into fame role. As a protagonist of this movie he's by no means perfect, but still gets the audience on his side while he battles his nemesis Hans Gruber. Hans is brilliantly played by Alan Rickman - he's confident, ruthless and one step ahead of law enforcement in terms of executing his plan. The only thing he didn't account for was... John McClane.<br/><br/>The movie provides an entertaining battle between the two, while also throws some punches and makes fun of the police, the FBI and the media about how clichÃ© and ignorant they can be in crisis situations.<br/><br/>If you like action movies, this definitely is a must-see or as John McClane would say, ""Welcome to the party, pal."""
"timothydutton-46074","Null","1","1","8 August 2018"," One of the greatest action films ever made.
","Die Hard was a massive success back when it released and its easy to see why: It's an incredibly well paced action film with a wisecracking lead we relate to and an awesome bad guy. Directed by John Mctiernan Die Hard is a template for great action movies- It has relentless action, great one liners and suitable pyrotechnics instead of mindless CGI. John Mclane and Hans Gruber have endeared themselves in pop culture. What is incredible about Die Hard is that it has lost none of its edge and still retains every bit of its charm to this day. No matter how many movies Willis makes he shall forever be best known for running around barefoot atop the Nakatomi building."
"justin-fencsak","10","1","1","30 July 2018"," 30 years later still the best action movie of all time!!!
","30 years ago this week Fox released a movie called Die hard that became a punchline for Die hard on a plane (die hard 2), die hard on a bus (speed), die hard on a boat (under siege 1 and 2 as well as speed 2), and so on. It also started a franchise that went beyond its source material (a book called Nothing Lasts Forever) and on to video games (Die Hard Trilogy and Die Hard Arcade), soundtracks, and several sequels which couldn't replicate the critical and commercial success of the first movie, which put Fox Plaza on the map. In the movie, Fox Plaza is Nakatomi Plaza, a tower that's under siege by German terrorists. John McClaine, played by Bruce Willis in his first ever movie (fresh from TV series moonlighting), must fight the odds to defeat Hans Gruber (the late Alan Rickman) and in the end knock him off the buldiing in a free fall!!!! Die Hard, while it was released during the summer of 1988, is actually set in Christmas, making this a Christmas movie that's not for kiddies given its R rating."

"bitomurder","9","1","1","11 April 2018"," An unlucky day
","In 1988, a little film with a little known actor burst onto the screens of America. Its high powered action and wise cracking unsuspecting hero found their way into the hearts of action movie fans and, to this day, it remains a testament to the great and glorious eighties. The decade of great action, unforgettable comedy, and undying horror. <br/><br/>Following a short stint on TV's Moonlighting, Bruce Willis teamed up with director John McTiernan to bring to life the character of Detective John McClaine. A New York City police officer who flies out to Los Angeles to see his estranged wife and kids. What follows is the most unlucky day a man can have.<br/><br/> People do not remember that before this film came out nobody knew who Bruce Willis was, but after, you could not find someone who did not know his name or his face. His popularity is still high to this day, and it is all owed to one man. Detective John McClaine. Bruce Willis' portrayal of the character is one of the main reasons this movie is considered a modern classic. His quick wit and gun-tastic prescene make him the ultimate action hero. He is not the indestructible terminator or the special forces trained Rambo. He is just a regular guy who has been unwittingly sucked into the most unfortunate of circumstances and Bruce Willis plays the character like no one else could, with great humor and a sense of foolhardy abandon.<br/><br/> Bruce Willis is not the only great performance in this one. Alan Rickman as the German terrorist, Hans Gruber is amazing. He always seems to impress and that is no different in this classic. Hans Gruber is backed up by two great performances by his second in command Karl, played by Alexander Godonov, and Clarence Gilyard Jr who plays Hans' tech guy, Theo. Sgt. Al Powell, played by Reginald VelJohnson, lends a simpathetic ear to our hero and he performs amazingly. A semi-static performance by Bonnie Bedelia as John's wife does little to bring the overall performances in this one down one bit. <br/><br/> Die Hard accomplished many things in its theatrical run and subsequent release on video. It started the career of one of personal favorite actors, Bruce Willis. It gave us the unkillable and highly lovable character of John McClaine who still seems to impress after all these years, and it laid the groundwork for everything that came after it. Die Hard raised the bar for action movies, and to this day it remains one of the few high water marks for the action genre. This one is a great addition to any movie library and makes for an entertaining view every few months. While many movies seem to lose their luster after several viewings, this one seems to find its way onto my screen, thirty years after its release, more often than movies of only a couple of years old. Watch it now."

","Do I really have to explain the plot to you, dear reader? It's simple: McClane is a man out of place, a New York cop at a fancy Christmas party trying to reconnect with his estranged wife when terrorists take over. The set-up in incredibly simple, but the resourcefulness of our hero - and the charisma of a young, hungry Willis - take this film from the ordinary to the classic. Throw in a classic villain in Alan Rickman's Hans Gruber and you have a movie worth watching and rewatching.<br/><br/>There's been some debate as to whether Die Hard is a Christmas movie. Of course it is. It symbolizes the worry behind every holiday party, of trying to repair broken relations during the most wonderful time of the year. The awkwardness of attending your spouse's Christmas party? Die Hard may get unrealistic later, but in the way that it translates McClane's feelings of not belonging in Nakatomi Plaza, Die Hard strikes me as bracingly honest. The holidays are a rough place for a cop whose only real relationship is the one he has with his job. And throughout the terrorist-filled night, he hopes to use his wits to survive, save the wife he realizes he has lost and give the Vreski family the worst Christmas ever.<br/><br/>Die Hard also has the distinction of starring two character actors who excel at playing what can only be described as real dicks: Paul Gleason (The Breakfast Club) and William Atherton (Ghostbusters). Their IMDB pages are rich with roles that make you want to punch them in the belly.<br/><br/>From how Hans Gruber is treated as one of the stars of the film to its idea of one man against overwhelming odds, Die Hard has influenced every action movie that followed it.

Very much plot-driven, rather than character-driven, but this is what one has signed up for of course.<br/><br/>the stunts are convincing, and the plot is tightly woven.<br/><br/>Of its kind, this is as good as it gets.<br/><br/>My only small objection is that Willis's sidekick is a gentleman of colour, and this smacks to me a little bit of Seagal movies where there is always a black guy or a native American worshipping the ground our hero walks on. This is less egregious in Die Hard, but a tiny bit irksome all the same."
"crybabystinkypoo","7","1","1","20 June 2017"," Hard to beat
","I saw Die Hard at the cinema in 1988 and countless times on VHS. At the video store in 1988 or early 1989 when Die Hard was a new release the VHS cover read: 'The best action movie you will see' or 'The best action movie you will ever see'; can't remember. But either way Die Hard quite possibly lives up to the claim. Why? Part of Die Hard's genius is the setting; the Nakatomi building. It's almost a metaphor for being under appreciated. John McClane's alone; trapped inside a high rise towering above the unaware, unsympathetic world below. Eddie Murphy's character (Reggie Hammond) in 'Another 48 Hours' says 'I've been having a very bad day'. That's John McClane; he's having a very bad day; adversity's coming at McClane from all angles including the Nakatomi building itself. And the cat and mouse, cyclical nature of the action; it goes round and round like the winding stairwells. Clever. Die Hard's exhilarating e.g. the helicopters. Is it perfect? No. Criticisms: it celebrates violence i.e. at the end when pacifist Powell draws his gun on the Fabio lookalike as if shooting someone is a glorious thing. And as if McClane's body wouldn't be cut by the glass as he crashes through the window and dragged by the fire hose at the end. But I'm nit picking."

","This is by far the best action movie I've ever seen in my entire lifetime-a great plot, with great actors. This is also my favorite Die Hard movie out of all of the movies in the franchise- they just kept on getting worse after this one.<br/><br/>This movie was so good because it had a good balance of humor and action in the movie as a whole, it wasn't stuffed with random comedy moments, as past action movies have been noticed for, so it was a better movie for the action loving audiences, like me.<br/><br/>If you are an action and or comedy fan, you should totally see this movie! Just make sure kids 12 and under (mature ones, and, I warned you!) should be watching this movie only. I saw it when I was really young, and it wasn't a very good movie for kids at that age to watch.<br/><br/>Overall, I strongly recommend this movie!"
"angelapayfer","10","1","1","15 June 2017"," One of the Greatest Raw Action Movies Ever Made
","""Die Hard"" is arguably one of the best action films in its genre of alltime. <br/><br/>It is a movie that stays with you long after you have finished watching it. The characters played by Bruce Willis (John McClane), Bonnie Bedelia (Holly Gennaro McClane), Alan Rickman (Hans Gruber), James Shigeta (Joseph Yoshinoba Takagi), and Reginald VelJohnson (Sgt. Al Powell) are all unforgettable characters that you feel you know intimately after viewing this film. <br/><br/>The plot of the movie revolves around John McClane saving a building full of hostages, along with a more personal motive of saving his estranged wife who is among the hostages. John McClane is New York cop who travels to the West Coast to join his wife and children for the Christmas Holiday. He goes to her place of employment and while he is there, the building is taken over by German terrorist. John is able to slip through the cracks and not be detected by the terrorists. He is then able to spend the rest of the evening killing the terrorists one by one until he finally reaches the leader Hans Gruber in the ending climax. John McClane saves the hostages and his wife in the end. <br/><br/>Like the Indiana Jones movies, Die Hard takes intense action and mixes it with a bit of humor to appease different aspects of the movie watching experience. The director and editors did an amazing job with their use of angles and filming to create scenes that give a feeling of enormity and suspense. One example of this is a scene on the roof of Nakatomi Plaza when John McClane is trying to get the hostages to abandon the roof for the safety of lower floors, because he knows the roof is wired with explosives. The angle is taken from above and a little to the left of the overall scene. In the scene you are able to view the hostages, John McClane, and the FBI closing in with their helicopters. <br/><br/>Another example is when John McClane reacts to Hans Gruber killing the character of Harry Ellis. McClane takes explosives attached to a rolling chair with a computer monitor on top and drops it down an elevator shaft causing an enormous explosion.The angle used for this scene pans out to include the whole Nakatomi Plaza along with part of the police force. The enormity of the scene is felt through the editing and angle of filming. <br/><br/>""Die Hard"" takes the theme of good vs. evil and packs it into a highly raw action film that uses regular people to accomplish the impossible. It takes an everyday average New York Cop and turns him into one of the biggest heroes in the action movie genre."

","This might not be my favorite movie in terms of how seamless a story it tells, but it's the easiest to watch over and over. I never expected a movie with so much gunfire, coarse language and blood to be this smart or scintillating. The screenplay combined with everyone's line delivery possesses the same bust-a-gut insanity of Showgirls, except Die Hard is funny on purpose. I have to restrain myself from quoting this at everyone I encounter (so this movie is to me now what Invader Zim was when I was twelve. But I digress.) <br/><br/>I blush to add this, but it's hard to articulate why I love Die Hard so much without bringing up Hans Gruber. He is a fascinating contrast with the more lowbrow masculinity of the hero. Hans demonstrates both book-learning and investment in his appearance, which more men should possess but is sadly unnecessary for men to succeed in this culture. John becomes filthier and more battered with time, but Hans remains neat and tidy. It seems like a populist indictment of the liberal arts-educated snobs of the world who know more about art and style and can quote obscure Classical literature but lack marketable skills. Now, that's not fair, because Hans committing cold-blooded murder doesn't subtract from his charm. Remember this exchange?<br/><br/>Blond guy whose name I forget: There are rules for policemen. John (pointing a gun at him): That's what my captain keeps telling me.<br/><br/>Doesn't hold up, does it? To be fair, John isn't as unreasonable as he came off to me initially. Not only does he relent vis-a-vis Holly, he didn't really mean to let Hans die. But I know which of them I'd pick if I were Holly. That reminds me, I should say something about the other characters. They're hilarious. Holly deserves special mention, as she appears to think like real women do, unlike the majority of Hollywood's female characters.<br/><br/>So, yes, this movie deserves its reputation and then some. HANS GRUBER LIVES!"

","This is the most interesting action movie I have ever seen. In order to spend Christmas with his family, a city police officer, John McClane, comes to Los Angeles from New York where he lives alone. For a while, he makes an appearance at Christmas party of Nakatomi building where his wife, Horry, works at, but the whole building is occupied by the hit squad. John tries to rescue his wife and other hostage.<br/><br/>I like this movie very much because offense and defense of John and terrorists are worth seeing. The acting of Bruce Willis is nice. He can complete a hard action without using a stuntman and play a fine human touch well. In addition, it's funny that John doesn't die easily however he receives a serious wound. I think that character image of John is elaborated well. The close teamwork of John and Powell is also good."

Almost every other action movie nowadays in the 2010s I feel just constantly borrows from this one, but they will never ever top Die Hard.

He jumps off the roof and falls through air ducts. He uncovers deception and double-cross and picks broken glass out of his bare feet. No help comes from the naive and incompetent police, who are unable to get inside, and even less from the FBI. McClane is not a super cop. He is an ordinary guy, who doesn't want a fight. When he is shot, he bleeds. He hurts. All he has are his pants, his vest, his gun - which runs out of ammo. This is the first realistic connection the audience has. When you don't want to be in McClane's position, it makes for much excitement. John McTiernan, who's only previous mainstream movie was Predator, uses awesome photography and technical skills to give the film a truly polished and sophisticated look - it was nominated for four technical Academy Awards. He also allows for enough time for decent character development, most of which comes between McClane and a cop (Reginald Veljohnson) he makes friends with on a CB radio.<br/><br/>Die Hard manages to be heart-pounding and teeth-gritting every single time. And if you are one of those many people who have only ever been able to watch it on TV then now is definitely the time to rediscover a cool, classic and creative action picture.its hard to believe Richard gere was going to McClain its another Christmas film with difference 9/10"
"brianberta","8","1","1","8 May 2015"," One of the greatest action films ever made
","Die Hard has had many sequels but none have ever had the sheer amount of thrills this one had. This movie is about a group of employees at a Christmas party who get taken hostage by terrorists and one cop in the building has to save them. It's funny, thrilling, it has great performances, and it has great actors. This movie makes every fight scene look very tense and it has creative kills for the terrorists. It also surprises us with its well-constructed script and its perfect pacing which remains consistent and easy to follow throughout the whole film. The movie is not perfect though because of the marriage conflict with McClane and his wife. It's great for an action movie to have a character development but I found it to be uninteresting. But this is a minor complaint on my part. Overall, this movie is fantastic. It's super entertaining and it has influenced many later action films. Many have tried to top this but none have ever succeeded. This movie is probably one of if not the best action movie of all time and it's a must watch for all fans of the action genre."

Pure action, realistic (the hero and characters are human and can get hurt), very impressive - realistic yet again - pyrotechnics and special effects, is what the modern action film should be.<br/><br/>Played by Alan Rickman, ""Hans Gruber"" is a cold and calculated criminal, with a layer of dark humour without going over the top, the epitome of movie leading terrorist.<br/><br/>I see ""DIE HARD"" (1988), directed by John McTiernan; starring Bruce Willis, Alan Rickman and Bonnie Bedelia as a classic action film."
"GanzEhrlich","9","1","1","13 September 2014"," I'd still pick Vengeance over this for some reason... But the original is better!
","Some define Die Hard as the greatest action movie of the 1980s. They are perfectly correct, although others run it close.<br/><br/>Die Hard is a powerful, if very ludicrous hostage movie where German terrorists, led by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) take citizens partying inside the upper floors of the Nakatomi Plaza in Los Angeles on Christmas Eve hostage as they try to seize $640 million in bearer bonds (giant $100k bank notes, in effect).<br/><br/>But they probably didn't expect ace NYPD cop John McClane (Bruce Willis), visiting his estranged wife for the holidays, to incapacitate or kill each of Gruber's supporting minions, one by one and unravel his plan.<br/><br/>Alan Rickman was great as Hans Gruber. His German accent was decent enough and he made for a very evil character. But the cake has to go to Willis for his performance as the hardcore McClane. Before Die Hard, Bruce was in this TV show called Moonlighting and there was no way people would think he could rival Schwarzenegger in the action man stakes. How wrong they all were.<br/><br/>Willis plays his role to perfection. His dialogue, humour, intelligence and busted up physique were just completely seamless. He hardly feels pain, but the fact that he has a sense of fear makes him feel a lot more vulnerable than some of Schwarzenegger's characters. His humanity is incredible. In no way was he going to win an Oscar, but either way it is an injustice he wasn't nominated for a major award in some shape or form, such as a Saturn. Maybe I'm overrating him but he felt so real.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is also superb. I really like the cop who discusses problems with McClane over the radio, but as for the terrorists, I wasn't focusing on any of them that much. It was funny that all of the gutless 'good guys' e.g. much more linear and arrogant police officers, horrible news reporters (Holly punching the journalist in the face at the end felt sooooo justified) got some comeuppance for their behaviour.<br/><br/>Every few minutes there is a scene of action that builds on the previous one, culminating in that giant explosion on the roof. Over time the tower (and McClane's appearance) deteriorate to the point where it is almost a smouldering ruin. Overall, Die Hard blew away all other contenders at the time and was a template for following action movies (I think Taken referenced a few moments and themes in Die Hard, for example).<br/><br/>Yet unusually if had to choose one Die Hard movie, I'd probably take Die Hard with A Vengeance instead of the original... I guess because the setting and supporting cast is more recognized."

","Die Hard is one of the most amazing and (I think) revolutionary action films of the late 1980's and it launch the career of Bruce Willis. Die Hard was based off the novel ""Nothing Lasts Forever"" written by Roderick Thorp in 1979. There is a perfect balance between action and suspense. And the way it's told, you get so into the story. You feel for the characters and want to see the character John McClane take down all of the terrorist that invade the Nakatomi Building. Other action movies usually just make throw away characters. And a plot nobody cares about. I'm trying not to give story. Because to me, you have to see it and surprise yourself. Because the funny thing Is, I first saw it on a VHS that I bought from a yard sale for 50 cents. It's one of my favorite movies of all time. Not on my top ten, but probably around my top 20. The action and the story are beautifully put together. The acting is great. There's even a bit of comedic relief. And let's not forgot the famous saying. Yippee KY yayÂ… well, I can't say it.

The plot is fabulously layered yet crisp, the characters are very strong (Rickman's Hans sets the standard), the story has many wonderful character moments yet gets on with it when it needs to...wonderful stuff.<br/><br/>In particular, Bruce's hero is brilliantly reluctant, always trying to sit out the storm rather than lead it along.

But anyway onto the film, We are talking about that amazing John Mctiernan movie Die Hard. Die Hard is basically about terrorists take over Yakitomi plaza and John McClain has to stop them. Now that sounds simple right? Well looks can be deceiving as there are many twists and turns and it all takes place in this plaza and in a few other places as well. Bruce Willis as John McClain is such a bad-ass in this movie and is easily one of the best action characters ever written. He's funny, vulgar, and overall a real character that you care for. But how can I forget one of the best villains ever in movie history: Hans Gruber. Alan Rickman plays this absolutely entertaining as hell villain and he is very different from other villains as he is very unpredictable and changes his plans when things go wrong and being calm and collect about it. His plans are absolutely deviously clever in this film. I wont go into much detail as it will spoil the movie. Alan Rickman is just so entertaining when hes on screen. Also, the secondary characters were great as well in their roles. Not to mention the cinematography is fantastic and John Mctiernan gets some awesome shots and crazy camera angles that make the film more tension-built and suspenseful but entertaining as well. Overall, this is one of the best action movies ever made by far because of the tension and entertainment value than any other action film. *In Alan Rickman voice* Now go see this movie!

I can't even explain the whole movie because of it's awesome action for the entire film. Great with the guns and it's suspense, surprises and pop ups will appear in this movie. Let's also consider the great acting of Willis and Rickman. They both have the best acting skills on the film. The others were 8.5/10 acting. They just didn't have enough screen time.

","For me Die Hard is the action movie, it's got the manly everyman determined to save his girl played by Bruce Willis' in his possibly best known role in the wrong place at the wrong time John McClane. But if it wasn't for Willis' superb performance then McClane who easily have been overshadowed by the merciless Hans Gruber played by Alan Rickman who armed only with a pistol and a British accent, essential for all villains, easily matches Willis.<br/><br/>And to really appreciate the effect Die Hard had on action films think how people saw James Bond films post Die Hard. You see lasers and space weapons after watching McClane fight barefoot with a bloody vest you can't help but question Bond. <br/><br/>It was Bourne that really got Bond moving creating the much grittier Craig Bond we know today but is was Die Hard that started the push for tough bloody heroes."
"tbills2","10","1","1","5 June 2013"," Die Hard is way better than good.
","Die Hard isn't the ordinary makeup of your everyday action flick. It has real guts and glory. Die Hard's well-structured all throughout and its foremost purpose is to deliver spectacular action in an innovative, raw approach, flipping the script on action movies forever. N.Y. cop John McClane is not your typical action star. Unlike most prior portrayals of action heroes (Rambo, RoboCop, Dirty Harry) John McClane doesn't stroll around with his machine gun killing off bad guys with some superhuman-like ability almost as if he's hitting targets popping out at a shooting range like the bad guys are trying to get shot. McClane methodically engages in combat using his entire equipped arsenal to emerge the victor, with the imminent threat of danger always lurking just around the bend. McClane manages to keep himself in constant peril, time and time over escaping certain death with an all too resourceful determination. Die Hard is incredible for it, for its realistic display of action. McClane matching against Hans and his band of terrorists is the weight and the overwhelming strength of Die Hard. Bruce Willis explodes onto the scene in the best role of his career. Alan Rickman is especially apt at playing a cold, calculating villain. It does a solid job of introducing the characters John McClane and Holly Gennaro, played by Bonnie Bedelia who is always fine to see, but the beginning seems uncertain of how to move through into the action. The beginning does do a good job though of setting the tone, giving you time to reflect and prepare for what mayhem lies ahead, time to get your popcorn ready. Once the terrorists enter the Nakatomi Plaza skyscraper, Die Hard starts to elevate to a high level not only in its entertainment value but in critical regard as well. It contains sharp editing and writing, having a number of good lines. Yippee-ki-yay. At the very end, the long, blonde haired German terrorist, you know, the guy from The Money Pit, he comes back to life badder than ever still well holding his deadly assault weapon as he tries at one last shot at McClane. Luckily, Sgt. Powell is there to save the day allowing Powell his moment of glory. This was an uncharacteristically tacky moment for this mostly masterful film, but Die Hard had already perfectly proved its worth by this point, so a little something for the kids doesn't hurt. Reginald VelJohnson is always acting as a cop, I like him for that. When you're watching Die Hard it will start picking up and it will keep getting better and keep getting better up until the very last scene when at which point your body will then need to be pried out from your seat. Die Hard is one of the all-time very best action movies, and it's all pure action. It's awesome."

","Die Hard is a masterpiece of action cinema, turning Moonlighting star Bruce Willis into an action icon as John McClane.

Die Hard provides relentless thrills, and epic action set-pieces, and at the time, it was refreshing to not have a musclebound one-man army as the hero. Hans is a truly cold-blooded villain, showing no remorse when he executes hostages."

","A decent actioner that came in the late 80's, ""Die Hard"" shows an ""ex cop"" slugging it out with terrorists who, for some strange reason or another, make all appearances of being German, or rather a conglomerate of ethnically white Europeans, possibly a mix of Eastern Europe, but most certainly from some radical group, like the Nazi party. Ho hum. Maybe Hollywood can indoctrinate a new set of bad guys at some point in the future.<br/><br/>The film itself is well executed, pretty campy here and there with lots of stunning pyrotechnics and plenty of gunfights and overall action. The acting isn't even half bad, or rather appropriate for the moments that appear in the film; high energy in some places, campy in others, comic book like in some other areas. <br/><br/>You can't take it seriously on any level really.

Simply put, it's hard not to really like John Mclean and his man of the people outlook.This flick spawned a series, but the original stands alone!"

","Die Hard is the best, of the best, at its best, challenges the genre and brings something magnificent. It is simply one of the best action films ever made, from beginning to end, is pure entertainment and no-stoping-action and emotion, a superb spectacle of action and pure emotion. What makes the film is the fact all the action sequences are so real that you is awestruck every time. Very well written from beginning to end, so that Jeb Stuart and Steven E. of Souza along with the direction of John McTiernan can do action with pure reality, and epic moments of dialogues between the protagonists. Bruce Willis delivers the unforgettable and badass John McClane, fun, badass, and with the best quote of action already done, ""Yippi kae yeah mother f # ck & r!"", Alan Rickman this superb as one of the best villains ever made Hans Gruber, and his sentences, ""bring my detonators"" and ""cowboy"". Full of action, realism, unforgettable characters, moments of pure epicness and intensity, Die Hard is for everyone, by everyone, for everyone!"
"pnewman679","9","1","1","14 April 2013"," Die Hard a winner but a couple of things to mention
","I found Die Hard to be the prerequisite for all directors wanting to make a action movie. I just got finished reading some negative reviews about the movie and I was baffled as to how so many people hated this movie. The acting was good and the action was great. The only part that I feel should have been edited out was the deputy chief. He was so stupid that the movie would've worked better if he wasn't in it. One other thing a lot people reviewing this movie keep calling the bad guys terrorists. They weren't terrorists they were burglars out for money. If you remember at one of the beginning scenes of the movie Mr Takagi says what kind of terrorists are you? Hans Replies ""who said we are terrorists""."

","Like other great action films of the 80's/90's such as George Miller's Mad Max 2, James Cameron's Aliens and Terminator 2, and John McTiernan's other classic, Predator, Die Hard provides a no-nonsense story that delivers action in a tough and realistic manner, building a level of intensity without distracting the viewer away from the emotions of the characters and without insulting the viewer's intelligence.<br/><br/>Fast paced action with plenty of comic relief. Wasn't a fan of Bruce Willis before this film but he does a great job creating a likable hero-of-circumstance people can relate to and sympathize with. The rest of the cast are excellent as well, especially Alan Rickman. Must see film for action fans."

","Basically, ""Die Hard"" is the movie that solidified Bruce Willis' dreams of super-stardom. Twenty five years later, Willis is still on top billed in most of his movies. This surefire Twentieth Century Fox franchise has yielded four sequels, including the latest ""A Good Day to Die Hard."" In the first film, Willis played a 'loose cannon' New York cop visiting California. He had been a member of the NYPD for eleven years when he flies out to see his wife, Holly, who works with a Japanese corporation at the Nakatomi Plaza in Los Angeles. He arrives for the Christmas Party, meets Holly, gets into an argument with her and then gets separated from the main party with his wife. Everybody is taken by surprise when a German terrorist and his minions storm the Nakatomi Towers. They take everybody hostage, but they slip up and miss John McClane. The terrorist leader, Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman of ""Galaxy Quest""), wants to steal the $640 million in negotiable bearer bonds in Mr. Takagi's company safe. Along the way, Gruber has a person duel with our hard-headed hero. They chase him around the building and at one point, he wraps a fire hose around his waist and flies through a window with a machine gun in his fist sputtering rounds. This is one terrific actioneer."
"eti55","10","1","1","7 February 2013"," Greatest Cop Action Movie Ever
","Die Hard is a non stop thrill ride from beginning to end. That's not what makes this movie so special though. It's the story, the acting and the characters. <br/><br/>NYPD Officer John McClane (played to hard boiled perfection by Bruce Willis) is the walking definition of a hero: a regular guy who gets thrown into a dire situation and reacts well to it. McClane has flown to LA to see his estranged wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) for Christmas, and meets her at the building where she works, at her company's Christmas party. They waste no time in getting into yet another spat, when suddenly a group of terrorists seizes the building..and everyone on the 30th floor. At least it seems like terrorists at first (we find out that these ""terrorists"" in fact have something else in mind). McClane slips away unnoticed by the supposed terrorists, with his gun (if not his shoes..and yes, he regrets that one later), and proceeds to wreak havoc on the terrorists, led by Hans Gruber (played by Alan Rickman in a performance that's nothing short of superb), and his right arm Karl, played by a really angry-looking Alexander Godunov. When McClane isn't taking the bad guys out one at a time, wriggling around in air vents and the elevator shaft, he has to deal with an idiotic deputy police chief (a classic illustration of the Peter principle), a couple of equally clueless FBI agents, and a conniving co worker of Holly's who tries to turn McClane into Gruber by telling him who he really is (up to that point Gruber didn't know his name). There's also an ambitious dirt bag of a TV news reporter played by William Atherton, who ends up giving Holly's identity out over the air.<br/><br/>Die Hard is a rarity among action flicks in that the action is actually plausible (unlike the various sequels). The characters are believable too (yes, even that moron of a deputy police chief)..and interesting. This more than keeps things going during the short breaks in the action. All this makes Die Hard the best movie of its genre ever made."

","John McClane is a cop from New York who is on his way to Los Angeles to see his family. <br/><br/>Holly, his wife moved to LA because of a job at the Nakatomi Corporation. When he arrives at Nakatomi Plaza, he and Holly go into a private bathroom and get into an argument. <br/><br/>When Holly leaves to give a speech, thirteen armed terrorists lead by Hans Gruber seize control of the building and take the occupants of the 30th floor, who are the only ones left in the building, hostage. <br/><br/>Luckily, they missed John and he has to figure out how to save the hostages before its too late.....<br/><br/>Joel Silver changed the way action movies were to be made with this phenomenal movie. No longer were action heroes going to be a force to be reckoned with, McClane is a human being, vulnerable, and this is the films strongest point.<br/><br/>Willis has never been better in his star making role, and is more than ably supported by the likes of Veljohnson, Bedelia, and Bochner.<br/><br/>But the film is stolen from everyone by one Alan Rickamn. To this day, there never has been a better screen villain, and it's not because of his evil-ness, its the fact that the man is so normal and just so laid back, its as if he's just attending a business meeting.<br/><br/>The action is taut, and despite the fact that the building is huge, it's a very claustrophobic movie, that never lets go of you once we hear the first gunshot.<br/><br/>Hilarious in places, very gut wrenching in others, but always thrilling, Die Hard is not only the greatest action movie of all time.<br/><br/>In my humble opinion, it's the greatest film ever made."

","****Please note that I will include spoilers in this review****<br/><br/>Okay, so 24 years after its release, I finally saw Die Hard. I went in with quite high hopes and thank god that this 2 1/2 hr masterpiece did not disappoint me one little bit.<br/><br/>To be honest, there was pretty much no bad aspect of this film. Each actor did an incredible job playing their roles, most notably Bruce Willis and Alan Rickman who were just unbelievable. The rest of the characters around them were very good and the plot was very simple yet deeply elaborated on.<br/><br/>There were many scenes where I jumped in excitement. One such scene was when Alan Rickman's character, Hans Gruber, shoots down the boss of the hotel after he decided to not give the location. The moment where the blood splatters all over the wall was awesome and from that moment on, it was just perfect. <br/><br/>Besides the unbelievable gunfights, another thing that made this film incredible to me, were two actors I really loved, playing the two main roles. Alan Rickman and Bruce Willis really made this film a whole lot more special than it could've been. <br/><br/>The fight sequence where Hans and another one of his men decide to break the glass around John was thrilling. The action sequences were far ahead of its time at this stage. The special effects were just stunning for a 1988 film and it seemed like the visual effects were done at around 2005. <br/><br/>This clearly shows George Lucas (the new one) wrong. Special effects aren't what drives a movie. <br/><br/>Pretty much everything in this film was awesome. Another character I really liked in this film, apart from John and Hans was Seargeant Reginald. The bond between he and John was great. <br/><br/>Perfect movie! 10/10 anyday!"
"achyutktelang","Null","1","1","6 October 2012"," A classic action movie
","Die Hard is one of those movies that doesn't get old. It belongs to that golden era of beautiful action movies. <br/><br/>The movie gets straight to the point and it just flows smoothly. Bruce Willis (John Mc Clane)is lovable as the NYPD cop mainly because he is not shown as an extraordinary action hero like a super hero, but because he is shown very humane. The way he too gets nervous and makes errors or the way he fights or argues with himself about the decisions that he is making. In spite of that, he uses his intelligence and training to do the best he can in the hopeless situation that he is in. You also love him for his ability to get under the skin of others.<br/><br/>There are some other beautiful aspects to the movie like John's interactions with Sgt. Al Powell (which are not even face to face), which are touching and will bring a smile to you and the kind of connection they build even though they have never seen each other is so good. <br/><br/>The way they have portrayed the role of the TV crew and the news channels, the way they interfere and actually do a lot of harm just to get ahead of other news channels, is worthy of applause.<br/><br/>All in all a wonderful action movie that you can watch any time and again and again."

"massivepinch","9","1","1","2 August 2012"," The greatest action movie of them all.
","When John McTiernan made Die Hard he created in my opinion the greatest action movie of them all. A film based on raw fear, which gave the audience a real taste of what terrorism actually felt like. Although i was much younger then the films certificate rating, it was one of those movies (due to the sheer quality) that my father would let me stay up and watch. I remember being thrilled from start to finish by the depth in characters, the outstanding quality of the acting (Rickman as the devious villain is particularly brilliant) and the twists which play out throughout it. This is a movie where until the last minute you are never sure if the good guy will prevail. Against all odds Willis's John McClane is brutally put through is paces by a crack squad of international thieves, who are, lets just say, less then pleased with our hero's efforts to prevent them succeeding in their mission. There is just something different about this movie which puts it above other action movies. Its the personal touches which do it for me, the belief in the characters, and that they could actually be real. You care about McClane's failing relationship with his wife, you care about the cop who can no longer use his gun. You even keep an eye on the mindsets of the villains, not just Rickman, but the two brothers, the eccentric computer cracker. And even the limo driver has a part to play. This people is a film of real genius. If you enjoy films of real character depth, and plot brilliance along with solid action, you will find no greater than this."

"SheriffGariss87","10","1","1","5 April 2010"," Still my All-Time Favorite
","I was born in the year this movie was filmed, which was 1987. It wasn't until exactly 10 years after it was released until I saw it. Oh, how I remember Christmas of '98, I was supposed to go to bed and let Santa do his thing, when I put in a VHS tape of something my cousin let me borrow earlier that night. It was Die Hard. It has to be some kind of coincidence that I had no idea it was even a Christmas movie..<br/><br/>Over a decade has gone by since I saw it for the first time and I have to say thats it's more than safe to decide that I will never substitute the #1 spot on my list with anything else! It's a little strange actually, seeing how the rest of my favorites consist a lot of horror (Alfred Hitchcock, John Carpenter, etc.) I love low-budget, under-the- radar cult classics and thats exactly why it surprises me when I think that my all-time favorite movie is an all-out action blockbuster! Hold back any pre-meditated opinions on the current Bruce Willis. This is what took him out of the TV and onto the big screen. He is young and full of energy here, unlike the roles we have seen him in for quite some time now. The use of the camera in this movie is excellent, as it is obvious at times that the style is heavily influenced by European films of earlier times. John McTiernan directed Predator the year before, and would later go on to such projects as The Hunt For Red October, Last Action Hero, and the third Die Hard movie. His style is quite interesting, and he definitely knows how to make a suspense thriller.<br/><br/>I'm not really a fan of people actually explaining the overall plot, as there are other ways for one to find out what the movie is about without having to read someone else's ""review"". With this movie, take it for what it is. You might watch this movie nowadays and think that you have for sure seen this be done before. But remember that this was the summer of 1988 when this movie hit theaters, and that although some movies have been strikingly similar, this was where it was done first and best!"
"johnmschofield","10","1","1","20 February 2010"," A non stop action fest which will always deliver
","I really like this film and it is safe to say that I liked it from the first time I watched it. There is just something about it that works for me. None of the actors particularly stood out above any of the others and the storyline is automatically limited due to any action taking place at the main building but work it does and as I have said before about other films this just feels right. The director and crew did an acceptable job regarding all the special effects but this film is in a fortunate position in that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. That makes this film special and the result is a non stop action fest and in that regard it is very well made. The leading criminal is very convincing and has a motley crew assembled all of whom appear to have no scruples whatsoever when it comes to getting whatever they want. The Police and others in authority are generally portrayed as idiots which also works well. Yes its contrived and not quite believable but like I said it works and any obvious joins or inadequacies during the just over two hours length do not spoil the enjoyment. I got carried away with the excitement and just let it roll. The film is called Die Hard and most of those involved are not going to go without a vicious fight and frankly that is part of its appeal. The bad guys are not just fodder for the good guy to blow away, they have more than a modicum of intelligence and of course get increasingly frustrated that they cannot dispose of the Bruce Willis character. The finale is predictable but is entirely in keeping with the rest of the film. Anyway I would recommend this film to anybody just enjoy the ride and don't look down too often."
"grahamyounie","9","1","1","29 January 2010"," Bruce Willis in the best film of his career!
","Die Hard is one of those 80's movies that, as the title suggests, doesn't die. It still holds up today as one of the best action thrillers ever.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis has probably never been better than here, his first and best outing as New York cop John McClane. Willis seems to have a hunger to prove himself here, something he far too often doesn't exude. This was his first real big budget attempt to break into the big league and he succeeded. His John McClane is a moody, sarcastic quick witted tough guy, but more importantly he's a regular Joe, he's no muscle bound Arnie Clone dispatching bad guys with ease, quite the opposite, every kill comes with blood and sweat, taking the steam out of our hero on numerous occasions, and at one point, he comes close to tears. This kind of vulnerability is what makes John McClane so likable. He's really up against it, one man against at least a dozen terrorists led by the excellent Alan Rickman.<br/><br/>Alan Rickman also excels in what is still one of the best bad guy roles. He plays Hans Gruber as a suit wearing classic music loving ego maniac, who will do anything to get what he wants, but always remaining gentleman like, rarely cussing and rarely losing his cool, even when faced with McClane. It's a smart, classy portrayal and he makes for a great villain in contrast to Willis wisecracking New Yorker.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast are also great, even the smaller roles seem authentic and real, from construction workers, to swat team members, to FBI agents to news men. Rarely does an action film feel this way. Too often smaller characters are just their to fill out the story and say their lines but here they feel like they really are in this situation and this is one of the reasons Die Hard is so good, everyone is on their game. Standouts include McClanes wife Holly, who remains a hostage throughout, Ellis, the coke snorting obnoxious yuppie who is likewise a hostage and feels he can negotiate with the terrorists, and Al, the nice guy patrol cop on the outside who communicates and bonds with McClane from the outside via walkie talkie. A mention also has to go out to the terrorists themselves. Each one has their own identity, each one their own ticks,they argue with each other, they debate with each other and most of all they just want to kill McClane.<br/><br/>The action by todays standards might seem poor if your more interested in CGI overload, but back in the 80's CGI was barely existent, and instead if something needed blown up, it was blown up, and in my opinion, this way is much much better. This film is down and dirty explosive and bloody. When McClane gets into numerous hand to hand fights they feel real and messy, like a fight ought to be, not choreographed into an inch of their life like a Van Damme film for example, these fights are raw, head butts, check, bashing heads on pipes, check, shooting a guy on the balls, check, it's all done so well and unflashy and only adds to the realism. Unlike so many other films of this kind, this one feels like the events could happen, nothing here is so far fetched, unlike the inferior sequels.<br/><br/>What is also so great about Die Hard is the claustrophobia. The events of Die Hard take place in one very tall building in central LA. McClane is limited to where he can hide and manoeuvre, he climbs down lift shafts, crawls through ventilation shafts, watches outside police activity through the window and at one point jumps spectacularly off the exploding roof and into a window via a fire hose pipe.<br/><br/>The script is one of the best I've seen in a mainstream action film. Classic lines and scenes are here aplenty. You'll be quoting from this film for years to come.<br/><br/>Die Hard is a strong contender for best action thriller ever. Unfortunately the sequels have gotten worse and worse and the recent Die Hard 4.0 is the nadir of the franchise so far. Everything that's so great about the original was only partly present in Die Hard 2 but even that failed to capture the magic of the first.<br/><br/>So forget the sequels for now and if you haven't seen this, and frankly there's not a lot of you out there, go see this now. Yipeekaye."

","This film made Bruce Willis a star.<br/><br/>Die Hard it's the typical action film. The plot is easy to understand (at least most of it), the rhythm is great, the same happy ending. Even the tile shows it: ""Die Hard"", or better said die never. So far, so good, but what makes this title so special?<br/><br/>First, it's the character John McLane (Bruce Willis) from LAPD , a very interesting individual. He's where the situation needs him to be, and that's right in the line on fire. Always careful, quick-thinking, and intuitive, McLane was in my mind one of the most loved characters in film-making history, even if he wasn't so good in marriage, we all know, nobody is perfect. Bruce Willis outdid himself with this role, he was authentic, especially with his trade mark: ""think! think!""<br/><br/>We shouldn't neglect the bad guy either, Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) a man who knows his way out with both the gun and the words, very charismatic and spontaneous, a pleasant surprise for me Rickman's interpretation, really got to me.<br/><br/>The action is perfect, from beginning to end. Shots fired, sweat, blood spilled, and most important intelligence and creativity at the same time (check the duct tape scene at the end). What more could you ask?<br/><br/>All in all this title excels in almost everything: characters, dialog, action, plot.<br/><br/>I personally didn't see anything out of place in this great title, not one tinny mistake.

","What can I say, this movie had me rooted to the spot. I couldn't even pause it to go to the bathroom, I had to hold it in. I can definitely say, I enjoyed this movie... a lot.<br/><br/>It starts off with off-duty New York cop, John McClain (Bruce Willis), going to LA to spend Christmas with his family. He arrives and is driven to Nakatomi Plaza, the building where his wife works. However, his desired break turns into a no-holds barred action thriller when a group of terrorists take over the building holding thirty people hostage. There was only one person they didn't round up - McClain. It's now McClain's job to thwart these terrorists, save the hostages and save his wife.<br/><br/>One of the most notable aspects of this movie is that fact that McClain isn't some 'super-cop'. He's just a normal guy with normal problems, he's slightly balding, having problems with his wife and doesn't have the best luck in the world. However, after watching to movie, you have to love him.<br/><br/>And then there is Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman). He is only seen firing a gun twice throughout the full movie, but he still remains a guy you definitely don't want to cross. Rickman has done an excellent job here and this is definitely one of his career defining roles. These days he's known for playing 'Snape' from the Harry Potter film series. Before that, if you've heard of him, chances are it's from Die Hard.<br/><br/>This movie contains a lot of action. Lot's of fighting; hand to hand, with guns, and even explosives. But for some reason it isn't too over- the-top. Although the amount of violence is very high it never becomes so unbelievable that you could mistake it for Batman. Okay, the scene where Bruce Willis jumps off the building and crashes back in through the window several floors down isn't likely. But it is possible and it does make you sit there watching the movie with your mouth open in amazement.<br/><br/>Personally, I find I can relate to McClain. Okay, maybe not all the action, but his comments and the way everything doesn't go right for him in life. That makes me relate to it and that fact I loved!<br/><br/>If you're a fan of action/crime movies and you haven't seen this then I'll be surprised... And I'll also tell you to get out right now, buy it on DVD, and watch it ASAP! This is a movie you WON'T regret watching. And if you're a true action fan, you'll agree."

","I think we've all become conditioned by video games and MTV style editing to the point that style over substance - or story - has become the requisite method of storytelling when it comes to an ""action"" film. In the case of Die Hard, we're talking a complete opposite impetus. It's plainly obvious that this film created the mold and should have set a standard for anyone who aspires to write, direct or produce a film in that genre that wants more than just to thrill those with explosive stunts.<br/><br/>Though there's a fair amount of guns and villainous treachery to be had, enough to satisfy any hardcore fan of action films, it's the heart of Bruce Willis' Officer John McClane and his everyday man determination to right a wrong that rises Die Hard out of the been there done that approach of storytelling.<br/><br/>His portrayal gives a needed balance to the yang of Alan Rickman's Hans Gruber character. Making both Willis and Rickman's roles and their motivations all the more memorable and takes it completely out of cliché terrain.<br/><br/>Take heed, Die Hard is the pinnacle of this genre category. Plain and simple, it's a classic."

But Die Hard is a genius cat and mouse thriller. Both Alan Rickman and Bruce Willis give their best performances. The thing about them is that they weren't that big back in the day and now they are big. Alan Rickman really can act, and he knows how to pick films. Bruce Willis also. Both actors are fantastic and make the movie alone, though the film is fantastic without them. Die hard has spectacular action sequences and good dialogue for an action film. Die hard is by far one of my favorite films ever, and I think that you should see it. If you dare say that you haven't. Otherwise, you'll be chased by an angry mob.<br/><br/>Die Hard: ****/**** The Plot: John Mclane is a New York cop who visits his wife in L.A. for Christmas. While at a Christmas party, the building is held hostage by a group of Germans, and Mclane must stop them.

"TheUnknown837-1","9","1","1","3 July 2009"," with great characters, witty dialogue, and truly riveting action sequences, ""Die Hard"" continues to hold its place today as the most influential action-thriller of all time
","When it comes to the most influential and popular action films ever made, the 1988 smash hit ""Die Hard"" is a title that is practically guaranteed to be mentioned. This high-tech action thriller, based on a very good novel by Roderick Thorp, is a classic in its own way on account of the fact that it has revolutionized and influenced generations of action-buddy movies and is still mimicked and studied to this day. Apart from spawning three sequels, ""Die Hard"" is also a source of the most memorable lines in movie history, it introduced the great Alan Rickman to the screen, and unlike say ""Commando"" (1985), is a believable action movie with only a handful of moments were disbelief needs to be suspended.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis stars as a New York police officer visiting his alienated wife (Bonnie Bedelia) and his children for Christmas. When he arrives at a party held in his wife's company's towering skyscraper and the building is overrun by what appears to be a West German terrorist attack, Willis evades capture and begins a one-man war with the enemies all the while trying to rescue his wife and communicating with the LA police through Reginald Veljohnson on the ground.<br/><br/>Now, right from the start, this is a classic idea. What kind of action movie-lover is not attracted to the concept of not only a one-man war against terrorists, but also this battle being held in a claustrophobic skyscraper? But ""Die Hard"" is so much more than just an original action thriller. It's equipped with eye-popping special effects, truly riveting action scenes, and what's more, it's populated by well-realized, thoroughly developed characters with problems and goals, and full of very classic and original lines of dialogue.<br/><br/>The main thing I really liked about ""Die Hard"" was the Bruce Willis character, who does not become Arnold Schwarzenegger or Rambo once pitted against these terrorists. Rather, Willis is rather cowardly, spending most of his time running away from the terrorists as opposed to charging them head on in that same campy style that we've seen frankly too many times. And the great human touch is how Willis plays a troubled character, who before being caught up the battle, was trying to rekindle his relationship with his family, and ultimately proving to us that he's not very happy with his life or himself. He oftentimes talks to himself, sarcastically commenting on his mistakes and errors, and overall, you get a very sympathetic person with a good heart, but a poor way to expressing himself, and yet fights at his fullest to survive to end of the day.<br/><br/>But arguably the greatest performance in the film goes to Alan Rickman at the lead 'terrorist' in the film. Before this, Rickman had only been seen on the stage as an actor until the producers of ""Die Hard"" saw him perform and knew that he would be perfect casting as Hans Gruber. Rickman is very adept at playing devilish and frightening characters, finding just the right note every time to generate fear and suspense, such as this great scene where he gives a hostage three seconds to provide him with what he wants or else.<br/><br/>So we have a great hero and a great villain. As for the rest of the cast, they don't stand out as far, but with witty dialogue and realistic performances, they also aid in the film's entertainment. There is one weak point to the film, one that Roger Ebert noted in his shockingly negative review, at that relates to the Paul Gleason character, an LA deputy chief unwilling to believe that Willis is not a terrorist. Gleason did, I think, as fine a performance as he as an actor could have done with the material, but some of his dialogue, meant to produce laughs, turned out as rather unnecessary and annoying and it may have been better to ultimately eliminate the character from the script. But eventually, he tones down, and does not stop the film cold in its tracks.<br/><br/>And of course, we cannot leave out the action sequences. Director John McTiernan utilized the loudest blank cartridges Hollywood could produce to great what he called ""exaggerated realism"" and worked many months with the sound department to create boomingly loud shots. And the pyrotechnics crew is due enormous credit for creating the feeling that bullets really are clattering about the walls of the skyscraper or tearing through human bodies. Many times in films, we see blood spurt, but it doesn't generate the feeling that bullets are striking. In ""Die Hard"", the violence is choreographed so well that it simply cannot be put down as unrealistic. There are also some incredible stunt sequences with only a handful of moments that require us to suspend our disbelief.<br/><br/>And ultimately, that's the genius of the film. It's a story that we can believe. It's not Rambo with nothing but the improbable taking place. It's a sly, witty, realistic and sometimes dramatic action-thriller that is just as intense and riveting today as it was in 1988 and better than most or all of the big-class mimickers that have been released since."

","I love movies like this. When the good guy is trapped all alone in a situation and he has to ""take care"" of all the bad guys by him self to save the day. In this classic first Die Hard we see John McClane, played by Bruce Willis, get trapped in a skyscraper with a gang of terrorist. McClane has to find a way to take down the terrorists before they kill his wife and all the other people that they have as hostages.<br/><br/>Die hard is without a doubt one of the best action movies ever. It has been copied by other movies many times. Some have been pretty successful, others have failed miserably. What makes Die hard so good you might ask? I would say the combination of a simple story about a man that has to fight to save his family with intense action sequences and great humor. Another thing that makes this movie great is the acting job done by Bruce Willis. He can play a guy like this better than anyone else.<br/><br/>If you feel like watching a old school action film with great humor and no crappy CGI, i would recommend you give Die hard a chance!"
"vranger","9","1","1","22 June 2009"," Willis Tour de Force
","Bruce Willis first big screen staring role was quite a jolt to fans considering its very different tone from his star making vehicle, the TV series ""Moonlighting"".<br/><br/>In Moonlighting, Willis was perfect romantic comedy material, but his ability to perform deeds of heroism was very much in doubt.<br/><br/>The cocky attitude came thru from the TV role, but added to it was a capacity to direct action and violence that was entirely lacking his previous performance.<br/><br/>Often actors take a while to find the vehicle that best defines their movie career. Willis was lucky (or unlucky) to hit the mark on his very first try. Although he has branched into other types of roles in the decades since Die Hard, his subsequent roles are always measured against this one.<br/><br/>The movie itself is an action delight. It was very unique when made, but spawned the myriad ""heros who never give up and defy all pain and obstacles"" movies that have been made since. It has been copied so many times and by so many major stars that the list is too long to even begin.<br/><br/>Die Hard also gave us the most profane ""best remembered line"" in the history of movies.

"thesar-2","9","1","1","9 May 2009"," Die Happy
","Despite its flaws, 'Die Hard' remains as one of the best action films of all time. I've seen this movie dozens of times, and really enjoyed its sequels (aside from part 2, a la 'Indiana Jones 2.') This absolute classic set all the standards, or in better terms, clichés. So, if you watch this today, you might recognize a lot of the scenes, dialogue, ""surprises,"" but real ""die hard"" fans will see this started it all. Much like 'Halloween' really was the birth of the slasher film (others will dispute, but it really was Michael Myers that started the trends.) Unfortunately for the copy-cats, 'Die Hard' had an excellent villain (Rickman) and supporting cast. In addition, and most importantly, it had Bruce Willis who was, I've read, the bottom of the barrel choice of the producers and yet, contributed the most depth of ANY HERO of these 'Die Hard' rip offs. He had great lines, depth, realistic approach, was vulnerable, and simply human. As stated, despite its flaws (the white-to-green wife beater was solely a distraction and the fact two main characters seemed to just ride off in the sunset – yes, it was part of the storyline, but surely unrealistic to the rest of the ""it could really happen"" plot) 'Die Hard' was nearly perfect, and this was thanks to nearly perfect performances from Rickman and Willis. Not to mention the continuous and great action sequences. Basically, on Christmas Eve, Willis flies into LA from NYC to make good with wife only to help hostages during a heist. Only thing I would've done differently in Willis' role was, when he had the police on the secret radio, was to threatened the President. I'm sure that would've brought more than just the police. And $.74 gas? Wow, I love the 80s!"
"scott-sw","10","1","1","4 February 2009"," One of the best
","I would rank Die Hard in the top three or two best action films of all time. Most people know the plot: New York Cop John McClane wants to spend with his kids in Los Angeles. His ex-wife's boss provides a limousine to bring him to the corporate party. During the party, a group of terrorists seize the building, sealing it off from the outside. They did not count on McClane being the wild card in the deck. Die Hard works in so many ways--better than most action films. First, it sets the standard and formula. After this one, we saw many adaptations of Die Hard on a boat (Speed 2, Under Siege), a plane (Con Air, Passenger 57), a train (Under Siege 2), a bus (Speed) and probably at least a half dozen more I can't think of. Second, the story draws us in. John McClane, played wonderfully by Bruce Willis, is someone we can identify with. He is smart, tough, and flawed. He bleeds, unlike Sylvester Stallone or Arnold Schwarzeneggar. I cannot recall one movie in which the hero is totally bloodied like McClane is at the end. Third, there is a cool story with interesting characters. McClane's wife, Holly, is tough, strong, and we want them to get back together. She and Willis have good chemistry at the beginning when they talk and argue. We also have a headstrong Police Chief (Paul Gleason), the sensationalist Dick Thonrburgh, the insightful Sgt. Powell (Reginald Van Johnson), the overbearing and arrogant FBI Agents, and a very poised, confident heavy in Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman). The screenplay is also well-crafted, giving us a cat and mouse game as well as a battle of wits that does not degenerate to silly one-liners prevalent in Arnold and Sly movies. As story, screenplay, and characters all interact with director John McTeirean, we get a very credible, exciting vision of excitement and tension. Finally, there is a certain degree of believability to this one. Unforutnately, the believability was strained with each subsequent sequel. This is one of the best, bar none."
"fearfulofspiders","10","1","1","12 September 2008"," Incredibly Fun...
","Die Hard is a hardcore m-a-n film. Women will find an element that they relate to, but the action and dialogue makes this one hell of a fun film.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis is in the greatest role of his life as John McClane, and Alan Rickman is amazing as Hans Gruber. The action, as mentioned earlier, is superior to the vast majority of stuff seen in today's cinemas. From McClane stepping on glass to do battle, or the moments on the roof, it's all great. And the suspense and buildup to the heist is well done. The dialogue is great. The conversations between Willis' and VelJohnson's character are great, and allows for a connection between the two in terms of back story, and is proves to be some of the better quiet moments of the movie. The special effects, when used, are very good. There's a lot of swearing and blood, so I highly advise this not to be seen by younger viewers (14 and under, even though I saw it at the age of eight).<br/><br/>Overall, I highly recommend this film to anyone looking for a fun film to watch any time of the week."
"coindudej","10","1","1","4 September 2008"," Great movie!
","This is possibly the best action movie I have ever seen. It is funny, witty, clever, extremely violent, the perfect movie for action junkies ( same with all the other movies in the series). <br/><br/>Bruce Willis stars as John McClane, a New York cop, who is in (LA? I can't remember) to be with his wife for a Christmas party at her work, when a bunch of terrorists attack the building. I won't give away the whole story, but I'll give you a hint: John McClane is good at killing things.<br/><br/>Yippy-ki-yay, Mother F***er!<br/><br/>Directed by John McTiernen, who also directed Die Hard With A Vengeance and Predator.<br/><br/>4/4 Rated R for violence, obviously."
"cosmorados","9","1","1","17 August 2008"," The only action film to spawn an incorrect mathematical formula
","John McClane is a New York cop going through a messy separation with his successful business woman wife whose climb up the corporate ladder has meant she has had to move to LA with their children. Embittered but trying to patch things up officer McClane heads to see her at her company's annual Christmas bash. However a group of terrorists crash the party with a new agenda and John McClane undertakes a lone fight inside and out of the building as both the terrorists and the Cops seem determined to kill him.<br/><br/>This is another one in a series of films I have critiqued that shares a distinction of being one of the best films of the eighties. The characters in this movie are well fleshed out and you believe in the depictions of all of them. John as the world-weary, Bogart-esquire cop with a great line in pithy comebacks, but also great utterly cheesed off dialogue as well, Bonnie Bedalia as the wife in question has little to do but does it well, however in this movie it is Alan Rickman as Hans Gruber who is most memorable in creating a performance of a chilling bad guy, motivated solely by greed and with a plan so fiendish that you just don't spot the twist coming.<br/><br/>The action sequence and the tension cranked up by John McTiernan's superb direction is magnificent and you never feel settled as you watch, always nervously worried whether McClane is gonna make it out of there in one piece and the key scene with the glass is one of the most cringe making in movie history. The use of music, in particular Beethoven's Ninth Symphony is also terrific as it is used as both a rousing piece as undercurrent for certain scenes and joyous celebrations for others.<br/><br/>However, one of the most interesting things about this movie is the way that it has spawned a falsely assessed movie formula. For most lazy critics they seem to think that a hero against the odds equals ""Die Hard on ...something"" e.g ""Under Siege"" equals ""Die Hard on a boat"", ""Speed"" equals ""Die Hard on a Bus"" and also ""Executive Decision"" equals ""Die Hard on a plane"". All of these assessments however are incorrect as they forget the key thing that makes Die Hard the one off that it is, and that is that in all these films just mentioned the authorities are on the side of the hero, whereas the thing that makes ""Die Hard"" so tense is that McClane could just as easy get killed by the cops as by the bad guys as they both hate him. In that building, he has few allies and no-one else to turn to. This tension makes ""Die Hard"" the unique film that it is.<br/><br/>Best action film of all time? I think Raiders probably takes that, but it's certainly a photo finish."

"hnt_dnl","10","1","1","26 July 2008"," The seminal action film
","DIE HARD is THE action movie to end all action movies! Bare bones, lean, direct, focused, THIS is the movie by which all action movies should be judged! It's amazing, but DIE HARD really created the action movie as we know it today. There were action films before, but not like this one. It is the template for modern day action films: the humdrum introduction of the movie's hero and his boring backstory (separated from wife and family, yadda yadda yadda), the minor characters that will factor in later on, the deliberate setup of relationships before the action begins, then enter the bad guys and the fun begins! I can't believe this, but 20 years ago when DIE HARD first came out, I thought no way would this work with Bruce Willis as the 'action' hero! This was the smarmy, smug guy from the TV show MOONLIGHTING for Chr*st's sake! But Willis totally rocks! He is so effortless in his portrayal of New York cop John McClane. You really feel like he IS John McClane. It's really one of the most underrated performances that I can remember! McClane is a new breed of action hero: he uses his brains, common sense, and street smarts as much as his muscle (of which he doesn't have a whole lot!). Watching McClane outsmart the bad guys is truly entertaining! <br/><br/>The bad guys! Led by none other than Alan Rickman (who should have gotten a Best Supporting Actor nomination), these guys are super-cool, relentless, foreign uber-thugs the likes of which had never been put to screen. Whenever you see scary, out-of-place, larger-than-life bad guys in action movies, remember, DIE HARD did it first (and still best). Rickman plays Hans Gruber, some self-proclaimed terrorist who is really out to steal a fortune in bearer bonds from the Nakatomi building. Hans is supersmart himself and has worked out a labyrinthine plan to carry out his objective.<br/><br/>The Nakatomi building! Where ALL the action happens. A brilliant idea to have the action within the confines of this super-duper LA skyscraper. Easy for our hero to hide while he's outfoxing the baddies! The building is where our hero's wife, Holly Gennero, works. Holly is played exceptionally well by Bonnie Bedelia. Holly really humanizes McClane to the viewer and makes us realize he's not just some macho tough guy cop with no personal life. You just can't wait for these 2 to reconcile in the end.<br/><br/>The action is very well done, indeed. Ironically, with all the explosions and shootouts, it doesn't feel overdone or tiresome, even upon further viewing. The film is so meticulous in it's attention to detail that you'd be hard pressed to find fault with it. The director John McTiernan did an amazing job.<br/><br/>No sequels necessary (although there have been several). You can't top THIS original!"
"Ibuk","9","1","1","20 June 2008"," The ultimate guy flick
","When released Die Hard was a massive success and shot Bruce Willis to fame. I loved Die Hard as a child and it was only when I brought the DVD of Die Hard 1 and 2 I realised I still love it. Bruce Willis was outstanding as the cop in the wrong place at the wrong time and Alan Rickman was equally brilliant. Die Hard is a unrelenting ride of violence and tension which results a superb bloodbath finale. Although I do love the sequels they lacked the remarkable brilliance of the original. Out of sheer loyalty to the die hard movies I went to see Die Hard 4.0 and thought that it was pretty good. Unfortunately it regular comes under criticism from fans of the original who say that the fourth installment was nothing like the first three. Die Hard is the ultimate action flick that is great for a guys night in. As a matter of fact I refuse to speak to anyone who says they dislike Die Hard."
"PeachHamBeach","9","1","1","13 October 2007"," Still one of the most clever action films of recent years!
","Yes, believe it or not, I have always digged DIE HARD the original. The 1990 sequel wasn't too bad, but the '88 original is the very best. Just so you know, I have never hated Bruce Willis, past or present. I just think that several of his more recent films have been turkeys.<br/><br/>This is the film that made him a superstar, being that mostly he was known for MOONLIGHTING at this time. With striking green eyes and a memorable personality, Willis was indeed ""leading man"" material even in these early days. What makes this film a good one for Willis is that he played not a macho grunting void like what Arnie had been playing, but a real guy, a guy who ended up exhausted, battered and probably in need of several pints of blood by the time this ordeal was over for everyone.<br/><br/>NYPD cop is invited by his old boss to come out to the West Coast for Christmas, which is also where his recently estranged wife lives. An uneasy reunion at the wife's company's Christmas bash is trying to take place when a group of mostly German terrorists (or are they???) invades the towering high-rise where Willis' cop and the ex-wife are. This renegade group is lead by one of my very favorite actors, the always delightful and amazing Alan Rickman.<br/><br/>To make a long story short, the obviously focused and experienced group of criminals takes Willis' wife (Bonnie Bedelia) and her co-workers hostage. Willis manages to be in a position where he was undetected by the group and therefore able to separate himself from the other civilians who are know being terrorized. Being a cop, he tries his best to undermine the efforts of Rickman and company.<br/><br/>A truly lovable ally for Willis is Sargeant Al Powell (Reginald ValJohnson), one of the few LA cop characters who has the intuition to help Willis rather than persecute him for his contributions to the battle being waged. The FBI, as per usual, is made to look like a bunch of buffoons, but Robert Davi is hilarious and I couldn't help but love all characters, even the jerks, like Dwayne T. Robinson (RIP Paul Gleason!) Even the terrorists themselves are brilliant, and there are countless moments of subtle hilarity and comedy coming from everyone.<br/><br/>The only flaws I have ever noticed are bits of bad editing here and there, but so what? This is an action-packed, engaging, memorably written and acted, touching and often times funny film that is perfect every year at Christmas. After 20 years, it is more of a classic than ever before."
"JoeytheBrit","Null","1","1","8 October 2007"," A Classic
","Die Hard is the film that re-wrote the action genre, sparked countless copycat flicks (all of them inferior) and signalled the beginning of the slow, terminal decline of the careers of Messrs Schwarzenegger and Stallone (and the somewhat faster dive into obscurity of the likes of van Damme, Dudikoff, etc). The film holds up surprisingly well, despite all those copies. It should be showing its age, but it doesn't, and the subtext of average working joe threatened by  and fighting back against  faceless multinational corporations (legal or otherwise) is still relevant today. Looking through the principal players, the fact that neither the director, the writer or the star has since achieved such giddy heights suggests that this film was one of those fortunate accidents: everything clicked, and we were somehow given a classic in a genre that throws up precious few. This is the kind of film that's easy to dip into  but nearly impossible to tear yourself away from once you have."
"Jetset971","9","1","1","6 October 2007"," Great Flick, But did anyone notice....
","I loved this film. But it had one little fly in the ointment that always bothered me. This is going to sound nit picky but I just have to say it. Did anyone notice that when the Germans have Maclean pinned down and Hans knows that Maclean doesn't have any shoes or socks on, He gets an Idea. Hans says to Karl, in their native tongue of German mind you, ""Shoot the Glass"". Karl gets this confused look on his face like he has no Idea what he just said. Hans gets miffed and says to Karl in English, ""Shoot the Glass"". Almost like he is saying ""Whats the matter Karl? Don't you speak German!"". I mean its was almost comical. Here these guys have made it abundantly clear that they are from Germany and that there first language is German, yet, some of them have to have things said in English in order to fully comprehend? Just a little observation. Still a great film!"

","I just rented this to watch again, and found that it's held up well despite the years. Great action scenes, great special effects, great story line, and hot guys. What more can you want in an action movie? Bruce Willis' character John McClain is the epitome of the American hero, a man who stands alone against evil and conquers it by his own strength, character, determination and skill. I'm sure that's why this series of movies has been so popular: we all feel overwhelmed these days with crime, terrorism, the loss of some of our freedoms and few heroes to look up to. Alan Rickman, in one of his finest movie roles, is the perfect villain: smart, cunning, greedy and ruthless. His cohorts, built for brawn and used as fodder, are great in their roles. The computer nerd is funny, intelligent and completely without a conscience. I love the limo driver; he gives just the right amount of comic relief in an overwhelmingly violent movie. The ""good cop"" on the street is perfect as McCain's on-the-ground support, and I love that he saves John McCain's life in the end. This is one of the best action movies ever filmed, and definitely worth seeing again if you haven't in a while."
"beerwine900","10","1","1","17 August 2007"," The best action movie ever!
","Without a doubt this is the best action movie ever.<br/><br/>There were a few great action movies before die hard. Dirty Harry, Mad Max and lethal weapon. (lethal weapon was made a year earlier) Dirty Harry started the real action movie genre, before that there were only westerns and second world war movies which were good but not the modern action we see today that have gun fights whilst driving cars and people running across roof tops then putting about 12 bullets in one person. Then in 1988 die hard was made and it exceeded past pretty much any action movie, and in my opinion still does. The action in die hard was brought to a new level, more bullets were fired more explosions a lot more ""drop it you mother f#####"" and ""listen to me you little s###"" were said which added that extra realism to Willis's characters situation,<br/><br/>I forgot to tell you the storyline sorry! heres a brief explanation if you don't want to know the story because you want to watch it, skip the next paragraph.<br/><br/>Lieutenant John McClane(Bruce Willis) is a New York cop who has travelled to California to see his wife at her boss's opening of the nakatomie plaza.(huge sky scraper) when he gets there he goes to have wash and unknown to every one 12 terrorists have entered the building lead by Hans Grubar(Alan Rickman) who obviously has a hidden agenda. Suddenly the terrorists burst into the party and McClane who is half way through getting dressed hears gun fire, he quickly draws his gun (9mm beretta 92F) and escapes up the stairs unnoticed, From that moment on McClane is on a race against time to save the 30 or so hostages and his wife.<br/><br/>Not only do i like this movie for the action and suspense but the script is brilliant and the acting from all the cast is great. Bruce Willis's performance as John McClane is amazing and one of his best, he plays a very good tough guy and whenever something bad happens you care about the character, Bruce has some great one liners in this movie one of my favourites is when McClane is trying to signal a police car so he throws a dead body out the window which lands on the police car, then the camera looks up at him from just below the window and he shouts ""Welcome to the party pal"" which i know dosn't sound that impressive but when you see the movie hes standing there covered in blood and dirt and holding a sub machine gun (MP5 A5) its looks quite cool. Alan Rickman is a great bad guy, he places a very smart, polite well brought up person but at the same time completely evil which is hard to to pull off but Rickman does it with style. Alexander Godunov plays Carl a henchman type character who's great, and a good match for McClane. Bonnie Bedelia plays McClane's wife she gives a good performance.<br/><br/>With the great acting, great action and a great script makes die hard a instant classic and a must see.<br/><br/>I give this movie 10 out of 10<br/><br/>Heres something that will make you laugh, apparently Arnie was offered the part of John McClane and he declined, thats a very good thing."

","I happily read comments about Die Hard, talking about this movie as the best action film ever made (or so). And I say ""happily"" because for too much time I had to stand these people who just laughed when I told them that Die Hard was my favorite movie. These people who can't understand that an action movie can be a great movie. But it seems that Die Hard had ""gained quality"" due to the distance that give past time. And time begins to fit things where they have to be. <br/><br/>Many people aren't able to make the difference, but Die Hard is not another action movie. I was 8 years old when it released, and at least 3 things made me pay attention to that poster in the hall of my town's theater: first was the location for that action movie, a building (maybe nowadays scripts are increasingly complicated, but then it was, at least, quite original). Second, its main performer, Bruce Willis, then a comedy actor, famous for his role of David Addison in TV series Moonlighting. And then, finally, was the original title, in Spanish at least, ""La Jungla de Cristal"", which you could translate in English as ""The Glass Jungle"", referring to the Nakatomi building. So, by the location, the actor and the title, I could figure out that it was not the typical action movie. That it was not, for example, Schwarzenegger's Red Heat, the other action movie that was programmed that night of 1988 in that theater. But we finally decided (well, not me, my brother and cousins, I was only a child) to watch Danko's adventures, so I lost the opportunity to see John McClane in a cinema screen. I never forgave myself for this... <br/><br/>I won't talk about its both original and classical screenplay, its actors' work, its perfect rhythm, because I read Madreviewer and (s)he explains it all better in English. But, as Madreviewer says, one important thing is that McClane doesn't beat each terrorist easily, as if he was a superhero. They're only twelve (not hundreds, like other movies make us believe), but the action scenes are cleverly distributed: is not McClane against everybody in open field like a war. It's more like a cold war, using his brains to beat them one by one. But it don't seem easy. It's just like one of these video games where you have to pick up every weapon you find when you defeat a villain, to store and to use them at the right time, because you start the game with just a Beretta gun. And, of course, you have to use the map, to guide yourself along the building, going up and down by the stairs or the lift, hiding from the terrorists or facing them when necessary. <br/><br/>So, these of you who may think that an action film can't be a great film, that a blockbuster movie can't be a serious movie, that Bruce Willis is Schwarzenegger-like, dare to remove those topics from your mind and try to watch the best action film ever made!"

","Ah the late 80's. A time when action movies were made by stunt men and dynamite, instead of computers and green-screen. Also, a time where action movies were of much higher quality. You had your Lethal Weapon, your Terminator, and of course your Die Hard.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis solidified his place in movie history by filming an entire action film barefoot. His performance as John McClane is hilarious and exciting. This man started the one-liners that became a cliché for action heroes later on. And he did all of his own stunts which includes the now classic jumping off an exploding skyscraper while tied to a firehose.<br/><br/>Alan Rickman also stars as Hans Gruber, a diabolical thief disguised as a terrorist, creating one of the best villains of all time. He and Willis have a great chemistry on screen, another reason this movies is so damn good. The action is also more realistic then other movies. McClane sneaks around and ambushes the baddies, (sort of like Rambo in a building) instead of running with guns blazing, in which case he would have been blown away in the first reel.<br/><br/>Die Hard is one of th best action movies of all time due to it's explosive action, great acting, cool location, and exciting story. Oh, yeah. And no CGI! 9/10"

Whether it's the time of year, whether it's Bruce Willis' superb performance, whether it's Rickman's performance, something just works.<br/><br/>Perhaps even the finest thing about ""Die Hard"" is that all of the above mentioned work so well together.

","Easily a favourite of action movie fans, and for many it is still the archetypal modern action film. Guns, explosions, stunts, fights yes, as well as plenty of one-liners all wrapped around the familiar 'one man against the bad guys' plot, and set inside a sky-scraper. Considerably more clever than most action films, thanks mainly to the script, we find ourselves cheering for McClane rather than simply sitting back and waiting for him to sweep up the bad guys. Rickman is perfect, shifting between being charming to being psychotic, innocent, whatever he wants to be, and Willis deals with the action and one-liners admirably. Veljohnson and Willis' relationship is just one of the many reasons for the film's unexpected success. McTiernen is an expert in this genre, and directs action better than anyone else in the period. Although the sequels are good, they could not match the action, claustrophobia, tension and charm of the original. 9 out of 10"

Willis is the invisable ""pain in the ass"" cop who gets away and hatches a one man war against the bad guys. The stunts are great and the characters are great. Reginald Vel Johnson is great is pure comic releif. Alan Rickman is a great villan and the bad guy comic Clarence Gilyard Jr. I think this movie is great and anybody wanting action and top rate suspense, this is the ticket. One thing, if you've read the back of the DVD case, it says that John McClane is armed with a service revolver, that is wrong. McClane (Willis) is armed with an automatic not a revolver. Just thought I'd point that out. **** out of ****."
"Joe_Walker","Null","1","1","28 May 2004"," Best Action Movie of the 80's
","Die Hard is probably my favorite action film, at least from the 80's. So many classic lines make this movie great. The plot concerns NYPD cop John McClane who visits his wife's work on Christmas Eve in a Los Angeles high rise, and the building is taken over by terrorists who demand money. McClane slips away unnoticed, is trapped in the building, and must try to kill the bad guys and save the hostages. <br/><br/>Very suspenseful and action packed at the same time, Die Hard is definitely a classic. The sequels weren't nearly as good. The humor is done very well and the movie doesn't take itself so seriously. Bruce Willis is great as McClane, Alan Rickman is very memorable as the villain Hans Gruber, and Reginald VelJohnson is very good in a supporting role. Die Hard is an action movie that is actually a great movie at the same time.<br/><br/>10/10 stars."

","Bruce Willis is stirring up trouble in ""Die Hard"" for the bad guys. In the first of three awesome films, he stars as Lt. John McClane a New York police officer who has been invited to the wrong Christmas party.<br/><br/>This is one of the best action films I have seen in my life because it has all the right components. Action packed sequences, explosions, special effects and most of all superb performances with excellent dialogue.<br/><br/>""Die Hard"" is one movie I will not soon forget because the story is so well crafted. Though there are no twists or curves thrown at the audience, the audience can be assured they will be treated to two hours of non-stop action from beginning to end.<br/><br/>""Die Hard"" did not only produce great action and explosions but future stars as well. I am talking about Clarence Gilyard Jr. who now stars in Walker, Texas Ranger and Reginald VelJohnson who starred in the series Family Matters. These two actors were pivotal to this film in their respective roles. <br/><br/>Two other names to keep in mind while thinking of key performers are Bonnie Bedelia and Alan Rickman. I was blown away when I saw the impact they had on this film. It is as if they came in and said 'Okay boys, watch out I'm taking over."" They certainly did that; however, nobody could have done better than the impact performer himself Bruce Willis.<br/><br/>On a scale of 1-10; I give ""Die Hard"" a 100. Th only regret I have would be that the movie ended. I wish there was more to see in this film. I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE ""DIE HARD"" AGAIN."

","*Some spoilers* All right, to tell the truth, I'm not a big fan of action films...but with Die Hard(only Die Hard, not the sequels), I'm glad to make an exception. Even though fifteen long years have past, Die Hard is one of the most talked-of and popular action films today. Mention something out of an action film to me and I'll probably visualize a heroic gun-totting cop running around with all the weapons that can shred even the most protected of buildings to pieces...but with this film, there's a massive difference. The hero's got a toughened attitude, he's smart and add the fact that the poor man is running around barefoot on broken glass(and escaping from murderous terrorists), you've got John McClane a.k.a Bruce Willis. The plot of the film keeps you watching every second(an unexpected surprise for myself)and it leaves you feeling rather satisfied at the end of it, unlike James Bond films. Okay, John McClane's invited to a Christmas party, held by his estranged wife's rich Japanese boss and when the party seems to be going pretty smoothly, a gang of terrorists raid the building, holding everyone hostage, obviously...except McClane. Alan Rickman, again, simply shines as the villain, the suave terrorist leader, Hans Gruber.(How many terrorists wear a suit while holding people hostage? Not many.) So, McClane wages a one-man war, using his wits, his limited weapons and a 'borrowed' walkie-talkie to get himself and the hostages out of this mess, plus a little help from a trustworthy cop from the outside, Sgt. Al Powell, played by Reginald VelJohnson.  For people who have watched this, most of you'll agree that this is one of the best action films ever made and if some people haven't watched this yet, go on, it's an entertaining ride of thrills, action and wit from start to finish. Recommended. 9/10"

This movie is entertaining. John Mclain doesn't appear super human or invincible as he mows down each terrorist one by one. He shows enough fear and trepidation to make each scene believeable. The director also uses a mix of drama, comedy and suspense to keep the movie rolling. Two hours of guns blazing, bombs exploding and profanity would have been too tedious.

","It's Christmas. NYPD cop John McClane(Bruce Willis) goes to LA to be re-united with his wife Holly(Bonnie Bedelia). There's a party thrown in the Nakatomi building with 40 floors and the party is organized on the 30th floor. Once John is there to celebrate Christmas with his wife, 10 min later the building is taken over by terrorists. They got everyone as a hostage except for John McClane, who now has to defeat the terrorists.<br/><br/>'Die Hard' is definitely the best action movie ever. Here are the reasons:<br/><br/>
1) The plot is really great. A cop has to defeat terrorists on his own. He finds out that these are really professional terrorists who are very intelligent and he realizes that his wife is in danger, the only 2 things he can do is to use all of his brains, and to confront the terrorists. This story is really original and many movies have copied this story, for example 'Air Force One', 'Sudden Death', 'Under Siege' and many more.<br/><br/>
2) Suspense combined with non-stop action and a little sense of humor and that on every floor of the building. Explosions, stunts, guns, helicopters, tanks, violence,... it has everything it needs.<br/><br/>3) Good cast: Bruce Willis as the cop, Bonnie Bedelia as his wife, Alan Rickman as the bad guy, Reginald VelJohnson as the police man, who helps John from the outside of the building. I have to say that all the characters did a excellent job. The acting skills are very good with no silly dialogues. Alan Rickman surprised me the most with his role as the cold-blooded terrorist. I'd give him an Oscar for that. I'm not joking. And Reginald VelJohnson and Bonnie Bedelia fit right in this work of art. And Bruce Willis just rules as the unbeatable cop, the savior of Christmas. He carries together with Alan Rockman the whole movie and this is definitely his best performance in his career, he's just amazing and became very famous with lines like 'Yippi-Ka-Yee, motherf***er! and 'Jerk-weed'. He's simply the best as the hero who saves the hostages and his wife and after all that, he surely deserved a nice Christmas.<br/><br/>4) The reality: If you see this, this could happen in reality, it's a believable film, maybe that's why this movie has a lot of suspense. I bet that the people who saw it in the cinema were jammed to their seats.<br/><br/>5) John McTiernan: A very good director who has much experience with action movies, for example 'Predator', 'Last Action Hero', 'The Hunt for the Red October' and 'Die Hard: With A Vengeance'. He really made a worth seeing spectacle who's really the mother of the action movies.<br/><br/>
So get your ass off that seat and see 'Die Hard' and his sequels now. You won't regret it. Prepare yourself for a huge pile of action.<br/><br/>

Not only does ""Die Hard"" give us an incredibly charismatic hero, but also villians that the audience loves to hate, an underlying love theme, action, comedy, and special effects that were very well done.  The look and feel of ""Die Hard"" emerged from brilliant director John McTiernan.  At its core the plot seems to revolve around one cop's crusade to defend innocent civilians against terrorists.  However with this film the viewer must take a step back and look deeper into the film. In this film fan's opinion ""Die Hard"" is based on love.  John McClane's love for his estranged wife is his motivation to go on and survive.  McClane, our hero is portrayed in an interesting way.  McClane is an incredibly vulnerable man.  He takes unfathomable amounts of punishment and continues to go right at the terrorists.  The broken glass in his feet, the numerous cuts and burns and the various beatings handed to him have not deterred his fight.  McClane's battle is similar to that of Rocky Balboa who competed so dramatically against Apollo Creed, because of the strength and encouragement from his woman.  This love theme should not however overshadow the achievement of this film in terms of special effects, plot, and directing. McTiernan crafted an amazing picture that not only kept the audience guessing but also tells a story with characters the viewer can associate with.  From the beginning of the film the audience is immediately supporting McClane.  This film should be recognized not only as a an action film with great fight scenes and incredible special effects but also a story about love, determination, and the human spirit."

","The action film that all others have to try and beat, Die Hard is easily the greatest actioner ever made. The film is perfectly constructed, and the performances for an action film are much better than usual. Alan Rickman is the greatest villain for one of these films, he is memorable without being over the top and also quite believable. I have seen this film at least 30 times and I never grow tired of it. Forget Face/Off and Speed, Die Hard is the ultimate action film, which in my opinion will never be topped."

I don't include any Indiana Jones movies in the ""Action"" category.

Every buddy cop movie from ""Turner & Hooch"" to ""Rush Hour"" has yet to match the chemistry between John McClane and Al Powell.<br/><br/>Not only did Die Hard make Bruce Willis & Reginald VelJohnson (who played a COP in Family Matters) stars, it also introduced most of the world to Alan Rickman, one of the finest actors of our time.  Very few people has the range of Rickman (Robin Hood, Galaxy Quest, Harry Potter) and he's the ultimate bad guy.<br/><br/>Die Hard is just a full fledged action film that other actors and directors will copy, but never equal."

Bruce Willis may not be the Best Actor, but he is very good as John McClane. Alan Rickman is fantastic as the villain, possibly the best or at least one of the best villains in an action movie.

An original plot, and this movie introduced Bruce Willis to almost a decade of blockbuster action movies, including three Die Hards, but none compared to the original (much like the Lethal Weapon series).<br/><br/>The explosions, machine guns, and hand guns go on for a good solid two hours, and it was a well spent ride, because there was also a good story. The hero isn't a big huge, emotionless army guy who lives to blow s*** up, he has a wife and kids, and would very much like to spend Christmas with them.<br/><br/>The dad from Family Matters is in this as a comedic side-kick type person, and Alan Rickman is a the evil Hans Gruber, which he does a very good job at.

You're not wearing any shoes!<br/><br/>Prepare to DIE HARD!<br/><br/>DIE HARD is the story of a New York cop, John McClane (Bruce Willis), who is in Los Angeles, visiting his estranged wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia). While he is sitting in a room making ""fists with his toes,"" a team of terrorists led by the brilliant, cold-blooded, and yet charming Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) seizes the building and takes everybody hostage. That is, everybody except McClane!<br/><br/>And so begins one of the best action thrillers made. DIE HARD grabs the audience and does not let go! The American Film Institute just released its choices for the top 100 most heartpounding movies ever made. DIE HARD sits at #35, defeating other edge-of-your-seat movies like CARRIE, TERMINATOR 2: JUDGEMENT DAY, and SPEED.<br/><br/>Personally, DIE HARD was recommended to me when I was 14 years old by my 42-year-old British aunt. She felt it was ""wonderful.""<br/><br/>Now, the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) did give DIE HARD an R rating and it is well-deserved. DIE HARD has pervasive profanity (and let's just say that four-letter words play an active role in McClane's vocabulary), lots of bloody action violence, and some extremely brief nudity.<br/><br/>But before that turns you off, let me say a few things. First, the nudity in the film is, like I said, extremely brief. The first time I saw the film, I did not notice it (and I'm the kind of ""goody-goody"" who is very offended by nudity and would notice it right away). Second, the violence, though plentiful, is also almost justifiable. DIE HARD does not have any TERMINATOR-style senseless violence nor does it have any RAMBO-style ""shoot anything that moves"" violence. One can relate to McClane and understand why he kills. Chances are, one would do what McClane does if caught in a similar situation. Furthermore, even though DIE HARD has abundant shooting and explosions, the final body count is 16.<br/><br/>""[McClane] is not here to be a hero,"" says action star Jean-Claude Van Damme, ""He is simply a man who is in the wrong place at the wrong time.""<br/><br/>Parents, if you like the plot of DIE HARD but do not want your children watching all the violence and profanity, I understand, and I'd recommend showing them MASTERMINDS.<br/><br/>Otherwise, get ready for ""40 stories of sheer adventure!""<br/><br/>Yipee-ki-yay!<br/><br/>Grade: 94/100 A"

It's been about twenty years since the movie was made and I wonder whether America has ever seen such fictional heroes, for example why such a hero did not save the Twin Towers by himself?

"MovieAddict2016","10","3","6","19 March 2003"," Have a ""Blast"" Watching ""Die Hard""!
","Die Hard<br/><br/>One of the most full-out action movies of all time. It had the best formula, the best dialogue, the best stunts, the best characters, and the best explosions. ""Die Hard.""<br/><br/>Bruce Willis plays John McClane, a recently divorced cop who travels to LA for the opening of his wife's new workplace, Nakatomi Plaza, owned by a rich Japanese man. His wife (Bonnie Bedalia) is happy to see McClane come, and we feel that they want to get back together. Perhaps this opening party will do it. But then it happens. As John takes a trip to the bathroom, a gang of terrorists (headed by Alan Rickman) take charge of the company building, demanding money. John hides out in the building and tries to think of a way to get the bad guys. They have no idea that John McClane is loose in the building, and only realize that someone is out there watching them when an elevator shaft is blown to pieces by Willis. Pretty soon, the LAPD, FBI, CIA, and just about anything with three or more letters is outside, and only one man has contact with John McClane from the outside - Reginald VelJohnson, a cop with a walkie-talkie.<br/><br/>This is, without a doubt, Bruce Willis' best film. By far. His personality fits the persona of John McClane. It's fun watching him, for once.<br/><br/>The formula for this movie is what makes it so great, however. Think about it. A man, trapped in a building with some bad guys; a one man army. The perfect action flick formula. But what makes it even better is the non-stop action and excellent, adrenaline-packed explosions and gunplay. People can criticize this movie for being unrealistic, but everyone needs an escape from reality once and a while. One of my favorite parts is where John grabs a fire hose from the top of the building, ties it around himself, and jumps off the edge of the building, smashing into the outside of the glass. Yes, it is very unrealistic, but I'll be darned if it isn't fun.<br/><br/>Reginald VelJohnson, of TV's ""Family Matters,"" is perfect as The Cop on the Outside, having contact with The Man in the Inside. VelJohnson has mainly gotten supporting roles in films over the years. These credits include ""Turner and Hootch,"" ""Die Hard,"" and ""Die Hard 2: Die Harder,"" which was more of a cameo than anything else. Regardless, he is a good actor, and it's too bad his career has been so bad lately that he has had to resort to his old days by re-doing his character from ""Die Hard"" by voicing him in a PC game. It's sad enough when actors resort to videogames, but it's even sadder when video games only want you because of an old character you have played and not because of you, yourself. <br/><br/>Of action is your specialty, see ""Die Hard"" as soon as you can. And if you don't like action...well...there's always ""Gods and Generals"" for you!"

","About twenty-five years ago it came to light that Elmyr de Hory had been painting fake Rembrandts and Matisses and Monets and whatnot. The fakes were bought by expert collectors and some of them hung in famous galleries. The fakes were so good that they became works of art in themselves, glowing with a technical mastery of the medium, lacking only originality.<br/><br/>That's kind of what this movie is like. I don't believe there's an original thought in the whole hour and a half of it, but what is shown on screen is beautifully executed -- direction, script, performances, photography, production design.<br/><br/>Everything's derivative. Nothing will surprise you. Even the score is completely ripped off. I mean in its entirety -- Beethoven's Choral Symphony. Nothing could be more obscene than seeing the faces of the murdering thieves light up as the vault door swings open to reveal millions of dollars, while Schiller's Ode to Joy swells up on the score.<br/><br/>The whole thing is as shiny and sterile as Nakatomi Plaza, and man that is one repugnant space. Towering blocks of geometrically perfect steel and glass, with three probably real trees in the drivearound, although they would have fit the general tone of the movie if they'd been plastic. The human scale is totally lost. Imagine a supersized Leggo community. Imagine the ants who crawl into those monstrous edifice wrecks every morning, pausing before the entrance, staring up at the steel column disappearing into the clouds, and moaning aloud, ""Oh, my God, not another day of THIS."" <br/><br/>Bruce Willis is very good as the New York cop who is the fly in gangleader Alan Rickman's ointment. This is a typical action hero role but Willis brings a comic element to it that, say, Schwarzenegger, Stallone, or Eastwood simply could not. Oh, the others could make wisecracks under stress just as well as Willis, but they couldn't do his hysterically shocked and frightened face when some contretemps comes his way. He looks really scared, his eyeballs practically popping out. Have you ever seen Stallone look scared? No, you haven't. Don't try to kid the kid. <br/><br/>Here's how you can tell the difference between the three main heroes of the 1980s action movies. Bruce Willis gets bloody and out of breath. Stallone gets bloody but is never out of breath. Schwarzenegger is never either bloody or breathless. That'll be ten cents.<br/><br/>I didn't care too much for Rickman's villain. With that aquiline nose and that mouth full of big white choppers he seemed altogether too slimy. When I first saw this movie, I thought this was the extent of his range. But I was wrong. I've since seen him in half a dozen other varied roles and he has a lot of talent.<br/><br/>It's curious to see Hollywood movies flailing about in search of an agreed-upon villain since the collapse of the USSR. I keep wondering whom they'll turn up next. The stock heavies have been Germans (WWII) and Russians (the Cold War). Lately, of course, they've been ""camel jockeys"", to use the current pejorative. ""Die Hard"" opts for the tried and true -- Germans, one of whom has a Russian accent. (Alexander Gudonov, a failed defected ballet dancer, neat guy, who died of drink at an early age.) The action is very well choreographed. Outstanding is the scene in which the roof explodes just as Willis jumps out of a window with a fire hose tied around his waist. He jerks to a stop when the fire hose runs out, smashes through an office window, and the metal roll that contained the hose falls past the broken window and -- well, and so on.<br/><br/>There's action, comedy, romance, and all the rest, done to a turn. If you want to be entertained undemandingly for a while, this should do the job."

","Undeniably, the movie was a precursor, setting the tone for the blockbuster genre we all know today, but it is still hard to understand how Die Hard is such highly considered when there is so much to say.<br/><br/>The movie gathers all the heaviest clichés of the genre: the bad guys are foreigners (why ?) and more dumb one from another, but the good guy is invincible and manages to kill everyone quite easily, the dialogues are often ridiculous, the situations sometimes far-fetched, the characters ultra stereotyped... and the list goes on.<br/><br/>Everything isn't to be thrown out though: Alan Rickman is particularly interesting in the role of the cynical leader, and one could also note the effective cinematography. But it's just not enough to raise the bar of this caricatural, pretty long -the second part seems endless- and quite jerky movie."

You also care about the hero, there's an excellent bad guy (Alan Rickman) and some great sub characters too. Its also funny but not clichéd with bad one liners.<br/><br/>My initial thoughts are; It's 1988 and things have changed; Bruce has hair, smoking in the airport, smoking in the limo, smoking period. Taking a gun on a plane in your holster is fine, cocaine is an acceptable party drug, tape decks.

He was not someone with bulging muscles like Sylvester Stallone or a former martial arts star or bodybuilder.<br/><br/>John McClane the every-man who happens to be a New York cop visiting his estranged wife at her firm's Christmas party, rather partial to Roy Rogers ends up being in the wrong place at the wrong time.<br/><br/>Just as the party gets into full swing a bunch of European terrorists take over the office tower block to rob some financial bonds, led by the magnetic and then unknown Alan Rickman (who in those pre Google days, some critics mistook to be some undiscovered German actor readymade to be a Bond villain!)<br/><br/>However as the villains hold the rest of the group hostage waiting for their plan to unfurl including getting an assist from the FBI, there is a fly on the ointment. McClane is on the loose and picking off the bad guys one by one.<br/><br/>You have a beat cop in contact with McClane, some inept cops, even more inept and gung ho FBI agents, a slimy journalist and a film director on top form giving you one of the best action films of all time.<br/><br/>A mixture of thrills, action and humour. Just look at scene when Uli (the oriental bad guy) glances at the chocolate bar during a tense moment and steals it, or Rickman naming some freedom fighter groups which seem to be made up and he states to his fellow henchman that he read about them in Time Magazine.<br/><br/>Ultimately Willis pitches his character just right. Here is an actor hungry for that breakout role and he sure hit bulls-eye here even though some of his subsequent actions films have been disappointing.<br/><br/>At the other end is Rickman playing the suave, sophisticated and ruthless villain. He brings charisma by the truck load and this was also his launchpad to stardom."

","When New York detective John McClane goes to Los Angeles to visit his wife who works for a large Japanese company he is expecting a fairly quiet time he certainly doesn't expect the party celebrating the opening of the company's brand new skyscraper to be gate-crashed by a dozen or more heavily armed terrorists lead by a German called Hans Gruber! Luckily when they strike he is away from the party in his wife's office so he is able to lead a one man fight back. Once he has managed to kill one of the terrorists he can use his radio to try to contact the local police although they don't seem to believe him until a body comes crashing through the windscreen of Sgt. Al Powell's squad car! He becomes McClane's contact as the situation intensifies as first the LAPD then the FBI attempt to deal with Hans and his gang. It is soon clear that Hans has anticipated the responses of everybody except McClane so it is up to him to thwart their plans.<br/><br/>The eighties were a decade packed with great action movies; a decade where action meant fights, bullets and plenty of explosions all accompanied by a few witty one-liners rather than excessive CGI and this is one of the best examples of an '80s action film. Bruce Willis was on top form as John McClane and Alan Rickman was delightfully over the top as Hans Gruber, Reginald VelJohnson also does a decent job as Sgt. Powell. As well as the almost non-stop action there some laughs to be had although they never feel forced. If you like '80s action films then you really need to watch this and if you've seen it already; watch it again!"
"secondtake","8","2","4","20 September 2010"," A genre-defining movie with a hero to beat all heros...
","Die Hard (1988)<br/><br/>A fast, well paced, formula movie partly because it helped define the formula. The bad guys are really bad, the good guy (one of them, Bruce Willis) is really good. We love to hate the criminals even though we have to respect their corps-d'esprit and their professionalism. And we sure love to love the hero, who defines the American hero so well even the villain recognizes it.<br/><br/>Is it believable? What a silly question. Why would we want that? This is an action fantasy where all is well in the end, not counting a good number of corpses. But these are mostly comic book corpses, in the sense that it's all just a game of types and of characters. Only Willis, playing a New York cop, has a fully fleshed out character (the chief villain has a large but still mostly two dimensional role).<br/><br/>The acting? First rate. The action? First rate. The set alone, this big new style skyscraper not quite finished, was a simple stroke of brilliance. Lots of glass to shatter, lots of explosives to detonate. A few sentimental moments as we go seem cheesy but are sort of necessary to make the movie the type of fantasy it is. When there's a little surprise at the end, and even the L.A cop is able to draw his gun, we almost are relieved the movie left no possibility behind. Likewise, when Bruce leaps down the shaft and grabs onto a bit of slippery metal with his fingertips and pulls himself into a little slot, we think, no way, and of course, go for it.<br/><br/>So, it's not a masterpiece in some larger sense of significance. But it's about as good as an entertaining Hollywood movie gets in the mold. Even twenty years later."

Meanwhile, a group of terrorists (the leader Hans Gruber played by the brilliant Alan Rickman) who take everyone in the building hostile except for McClane who luckily escaped and goes on the search for planted bombs.<br/><br/>This is possibly the greatest action film of all time, Die Hard turned Bruce Willis from a TV star (Just known for Moonlighting at he time) into a big Hollywood star and also made Alan Rickman famous.<br/><br/>Arnold Shwarzenegger, Burt Reynolds and Richard Gere nearly got the role of John McClane, it was lucky that Bruce Willis got it because it wouldn't have been the same. If you like this, you'll also like Die Hard 2, 3 and 4, Lethal Weapon 1, 2, 3 and 4, Under Siege 1 and 2, Speed, The Rock, Con Air, Last Boy Scout and nearly all of the early Steven Seagal films."
"SavingPrivateSam-ltq","10","2","4","2 February 2008"," What a film! Whoo!
","I watched this movie yesterday, I thought this was just going to be another typical action movie such as the likes of True Lies, The Rock, Speed, with good action but weak performance. But this movie exceeded my expectation and showed me how great it is and why it deserved to be ranked on Top 250.<br/><br/>John McClane, a New York cop, who was visiting his one on Christmas in the Nakatomi Corporation, only to find out a group of terrorist seized control of the building in order to rob some bonds(I don't remember exactly what it is, something expensive). They shot the boss and held 30 people(including McClane's wife)as hostages. The FBI and LA Police Department were useless and their actions even caused McClane more troubles and gained the terrorists advantage. The only help from the LAPD was a short and fat cop Powell, who was a the only sympathizer for McClane. The ending is quite predictable, John McClane defeated the terrorists successfully and left with his wife.<br/><br/>What I like about this movie, it wasn't the action that made this movie so great(although they were also well-done), it was the development of each character. Each character gave a staggering performance, not to mention Alan Rickman's performance as Hans. He gave the best portrayal of the terrorist leader to date, the other bosses in other action movies were less vivid compare to him. And John McClane, he seceded from the group of traditional action heroes and formed his new style. Unlike Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone, they were all great action actors but they lacked something McClane has which made their characters superficial, and they're more like a superman than human. McClane did that part well, he could be hurt by terrorists, he could still bleed, and he still had affections. Remember his emotional conversation between Powell, he mentioned his wife and his children, that made us forget about the thrilling circumstances and we felt touched by his words. That made the character McClane not only devoid of superficiality, but also believable.<br/><br/>The action was top-notch, I wondered how they shot the rooftop-being-blown-off scene. I hope the director will put this in the Special Feature in the DVD.<br/><br/>Powerful action movie. Even if action movies are not your cup of tea, this one also for you, unless you have a problem with incessant profanity, strong and gory violence. <br/><br/>Great movie. Replaced Lethal Weapon as the best action movie I've ever seen. 10/10"

","I couldn't say it better myself! This successful film launched both the excellent Bruce Willis and Alan Rickman's film careers as well as succeeded in all entertaining categories/areas of other parts of the film like the tight editing, the suspenseful screenplay, the intense pyro- technics, ""very special"" special effects, the stunning aerial views, the top-notch performances, the awesome one-liners, the dry sense of humor and the craftsmanship of under-rated director John McTiernan ( Medicine Man, The 13th Warrior, Predator, Die Hard with a Vengeance ).<br/><br/>The film starts out slowly at first by introducing all the main characters ( antagonists, protagonists ) and other random people ( FBI, hostages, terrorists, news reporters ) that all have a place in the the scary conflict. Then before mid-way, the film takes off at random speed and boasts everything a good films needs!<br/><br/>And after all these years, it is still a throughly entertaining classic that just never seems to get old. The sequels, while not great, were also worthy/exciting additions to a franchise and gave the world a recognizable hero w/ a killer one-liner reminiscent of a cowboy!"
"dvc5159","9","2","4","13 October 2007"," Action. Adventure. Willis. What More Could You Ask For?
","All NYPD cop John McClane wanted to do is to celebrate Chtistmas with his wife in a newly-opened 40 storey building in Los Angeles. But a group of 12 terrorists have other plans.<br/><br/>Die Hard opened in 1988 with explosive results. Until today, it is one of the finest examples of how an action movie should be made. It has everything you want in an action movie: cool heroes, bad guys getting it, explosions, stunts, and more. This is a recipe for an action masterpiece.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis portrays McClane, who (is now and later significantly for the three sequels) is at the wrong place at the wrong time. He plays a hero unlike those other 80's action types like the indestructible Schwarzenegger and the one-man-army Stallone. And definitely not like the stereotypic Van Damme and Seagal. Willis is in a class of his own, emitting one liners to make the audience chuckle and sympathize for his character, which is a rare thing in action movies nowadays. He is the perfect definition of a REAL human hero, one that someone else could relate to.<br/><br/>Alan Rickman plays terrorist leader Hans Gruber. He is the example of a cruel but wise mastermind who systematically plan out his sequence of events. He will do anything to succeed his goal, but always get foiled by McClane. Rickman portrays Gruber so masterfully that I put Hans Gruber in my Top 5 greatest villains ever.<br/><br/>The cinematography and editing is also great. Jan De Bont does a great job of scoping out the Fox Plaza for the Nakatomi Tower. The interior sets of the tower looks confined, thus giving the film a claustrophobic sense. This explanation can be further exampled when McClane crawls inside a ventilation shaft. Also, the quick cuts make the action scenes feel fast-paced, giving all the action scenes glory in delivering its effect. Production designer Jackson DeGovia should be given Kudos for making the interior sets as realistic as possible.<br/><br/>Action sequences are also properly handled. Director John McTiernan, who helmed the gung-ho Schwarzenegger action fest Predator a year before, returns to up the ante on this cinematic treat. He gives the action scenes realism, like during the rooftop helicopter scene. It is one of those things that you cannot argue whether it is absurd or not. That is what I like about it. The writing is also good, too. Screenwriters Jeb Stuart and Steven E. De Souza adapted the Roderick Thorp novel ""Nothing Lasts Forever"" and gives us a screenplay full of thrills. The tension is also well written and filmed, both the situation in the building where McClane is having trouble, and also on the ground where the police are confused, as in both situations you do not know what happens next.<br/><br/>Finally, let's give an ""Ode To Joy"" for the late great composer Michael Kamen, who gives a suitable orchestral score for the movie that suits it very, very well indeed, instead of giving us those annoying electronic 80's score.<br/><br/>Overall, Die Hard deserves a place on any ""Top Action Films"" list. An instant masterpiece that is well appreciated then and now, it will survive the test of time and will forever thrill audiences for many, many years to come.<br/><br/>9.96/10 Delton"

","I had heard a whole lot of stuff about Die Hard before I saw it, all of it shining, and yet the movie lived up to every expectation. The acting (especially Alan Rickman's) is note-perfect; the story is taut and thrilling; the screenplay is clever and effective.<br/><br/>Alan Rickman's Gruber has gone down in movie history as the best baddie ever. He is sinister, scary, and smart; you really do wonder how one lonely cop is going to take the guy down. And you even hope, just a little bit, that he gets away with it.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis is great as the everyman hero who must think on his feet, with not one ally in his battle, nothing to use except his handgun and his wits.<br/><br/>The movie stumbles here and there; the movie slows down a bit once the police turn up, and they (and the FBI) stretch credibility with their respective incompetence and callousness--to all but a man.<br/><br/>Still, they don't matter, and neither do the hostages. Everything is peripheral to the central battle between Gruber and McClane, and that is riveting."

Now its up to McCLane to face the terrorists and save his wife and the other hostages.<br/><br/>I wouldn't know why this film is rated so high on IMDb, but this site is known for having bizarre ratings.

It has one liners, a lot of violence, guns, profanity, explosions, villains, and many people.<br/><br/>I would love to say this is a very entertaining action flick, although it's running time is longer than it needs to be (I mean, two hours for an action film?).

"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","8","2","4","24 June 2004"," The best of its kind
","Most of us action-film fans have seen movies that follow this basic idea; hostages trapped in a building, police can't gain access and the only hope is one man, who's inside at that exact time, by pure coincidence. However, this one, I suspect, is one of the first of this kind, if not the first. It's also by far the best of this kind. This one set the bar for action films to come, and most of the cliches from films of this kind actually originated in this one. It has the perfect mix of humor, action and thriller. Bruce Willis is perfect as the wisecracking action-hero, and Reginald VelJohnson is great as the cop, and Alan Rickman is excellent as the terrorist leader. The plot is great, probably the best I've seen in this type of action film. It keeps a fairly good pace throughout the film, except for just a few scenes which lack intensity, but maybe that's just because I've seen it so many times, and know what happens. The acting is almost flawless. The humor is great, Bruce Willis redefines wisecracking with his funny remarks throughout the film. The action is intense, on a great scale and well-filmed, which is what you'd expect when the director is John McTiernan, who is quite experienced in making great action films. All in all, a great action film, definitely the best of its kind, and should be enjoyable to just about anyone who just mildly enjoys action films. I recommend it to fans of action films in general, but specifically for fans of this particular sub-genre. 8/10"
"davidmvining","7","0","0","12 May 2020"," The everyman as action hero again
","I've always wondered why I've liked this movie than what seems like the rest of the population, so going into this watching, I was determined to figure out why. I definitely figured it out, and it's a solid thirty-minute chunk in the middle of the film. Everything around it is top notch entertainment, but that block of the movie's runtime is kind of painful.<br/><br/>The main reason the movie works so well beyond that chunk is really Bruce Willis as John McClane. He's the everyman (but also a cop). He gets roughed up but defiantly maintains a certain humor about his situation. He strikes a balance between taking the situation seriously and maintaining his sanity through the insanity that erupts around him. He's a rather instantly likeable lead to guide the audience through. Across the way is Alan Rickman as Hans Gruber, and he's just a fantastic bad guy. He's smart, in control, and he has a plan. He only ever really breaks down once, when someone calls him a petty thief. He is an exceptional thief.<br/><br/>And when the movie is about these two antagonists working against each other, the movie works like gangbusters. McClane shows up at the Nakatomi Tower to try and reconnect with his wife at her company's Christmas party, but Gruber shows up with a dozen men, intent on breaking into the company's vault, killing whomever they need along the way. The game of cat and mouse that develops between Gruber and McClane is fun, until it stops for thirty minutes. It's the second that Deputy Police Chief Dwayne T. Robinson shows up that I begin to turn against the movie.<br/><br/>Robinson is aggressively pig headed and stupid. I'm sure there are many police administrators out there who are just the same in real life, but that doesn't necessarily translate to compelling drama. He's got Sergeant Powell standing next to him telling him how to do everything right (something that begins to grate after a while, to be honest) and Robinson is completely dismissive. He doesn't seem to follow any known procedure, just throwing police bodies at a fortress without any concern. And, to make matters worse, John McClane can do almost nothing about it. He does end up saving the police after a while with a well timed application of C4 and a computer monitor, but watching our hero shout pointlessly at a window because everyone else is stupid is really frustrating. And then there's Ellis.<br/><br/>I think if Robinson hadn't been in the movie and Ellis had been exactly as he is, he wouldn't bother me so much. But, right after Robinson is done being a complete idiot and derailing the central conflict, here comes Ellis to do the exact same thing, but smarmier and more 80s businessman. So, we get a full thirty minutes of two secondary characters dominating the movie by being idiots. Don't get me wrong, the action of the failed police incursion is done well and the tension around Ellis' failed negotiation works in isolation, but they push McClane to the sidelines.<br/><br/>Once that's done, though, and the FBI shows up, the movie is right back on track. Now, the interesting thing about the FBI agents (Johnson and Johnson, no relation) is that they have a plan and fail at it as opposed to Robinson who had no discernable plan and just did stuff. Also, the FBI plan ends up successfully setting up the movie's action climax and gives us tense action beats that actually directly involve McClane.<br/><br/>And that feeds into what, again, makes Gruber such a great villain. The FBI does what it should do. It follows a rule book, but Gruber knows the rule book and uses it against them. It's a competent plan by the FBI being outsmarted by an intelligent bad guy in Hans Gruber. As opposed to the police incursion which is pretty much just Robinson hitting his head against the wall for no reason.<br/><br/>So, I've complained enough. My problems with the movie are really that thirty-minute segment in the middle of the film. Outside of that, I love the movie. Willis and Rickman are great. The supporting cast is really good. Action is great. Tension is palpable. The character of McClane strikes a delicate balance between indestructible and vulnerable while Gruber is really smart and very good at what he does, creating a great foil between protagonist and antagonist. I really like this film, I just kind of wish I liked it a bit more like everyone else."
"MGPT80","3","0","0","10 May 2020"," How is this so popular?
","I've never understood the rampant admiration for this movie. As far as inane American action films go, it's barely even amongst the better ones- let alone a classic. Every single character is a walking cliche, complete with corny Bond villains, arrogant cops, witty black chauffeur and swooning love interest. Bruce Willis is uninteresting and arguably a little irritating while Alan Rickman simply deserves better than this awful writing. The amount of plot armour that Willis is given takes all the suspense out of the film and makes it a rather arduous experience. I have no problem with this genre of movie but Die Hard lacks the atmosphere of The Terminator or the charm of Raiders of The Lost Ark. A very forgettable experience."

","There's something special about Die Hard (besides the Christmasy atmosphere).<br/><br/>Die Hard comes from a time where action movies were bloody, violent, and rated R. Not these neutered PG-13 cuts we see so often nowadays. People curse, there's lots of blood and guns, and Die Hard isn't ashamed of being more on the realistic side.<br/><br/>That being said, this movie gets extra points for its realism. What makes this movie able to capture the audience is the fact John McClane is a regular guy. He's not the invincible action star of contemporary action flicks.<br/><br/>You don't know if his life is actually in danger. You know that the movie will end good but you don't know how. There's real tension scene to scene. And that makes the film that much more enjoyable.<br/><br/>Not to mention that it's damn quotable.<br/><br/>5/5. Modern action thrillers should take note.<br/><br/>PS: Die Hard IS a Christmas movie."

From the iconic score working between the classical music and the Christmas music, John talking to himself with an easy charm, and henchmen imbued with some personality, Die Hard is a clear classic.

","Die Hard is one of those movies that is an enigma. An anomaly. At the time of filming, Bruno wasn't a major hollywood player and seemed an odd casting choice for a rough action hero role. He had been in a few films and was well known for his time on the TV show Moonlighting (which he was still filming at the time back in 88 during the day, and shooting Die Hard at night and weekends) which was rather guerilla-filmmaking of sorts. But boy, didn't he do well. John McClane is Willis' perfect role. I cannot imagine anyone else in this part (and a handful of big stars turned the part down). Alan Rickman (as the villain) shines in every scene he's in, and was the real reason the movie works as it does. The chemistry between Willis and Rickman as hero and villain (respectively) is electric, and you cannot help but hope the villain gets away with it (of course, he can't. The hero has to win). Die Hard gives us a claustrophobic, tension-filled rollercoaster ride which leaves you breathless by the end. No other action movie has been able to match it for its quality. It has a heart. And a soul. Something that action movies seem to lack, as a rule (not nodding or pointing at anybody called Bay, of course) for no real reason. Action movies don't have to be just explosions every 5 minutes, or car chases that destroy highways, or muscle-bound one-man-army types gunning down thousands of extras (all without breaking a sweat... or reloading). They can be tense. And engaging. And actually have a proper story and plot. They don't make 'em like this anymore. Two thumbs way up. Yippee-ki-yay..."

","*MILD SPOLIER WARNING* No important plot details revealed, just something awesome that the main hero does.<br/><br/>Everything about this movie was orchestrated so carefully, that it makes for one of the best, most well-rounded, and immensely satisfying action movies ever made. It is, of course, one of my personal favourite action movies of all time, but not just because I love it, but because it's actually amazing. John McClane is the most likeable and relatable action hero to ever grace the screen, I mean he's badass but in a way that, everytime he does something crazy and awesome (like jumping off of a rooftop with a fire hose tied around himself as it explodes behind him) makes you go, ""Yeah, I could do that,"" even though you know that there's no way in hell you actually could.

John McClane successfully manages to evade the group of dangerous terrorists but he's stuck within the building itself.

John McClane as a character is relatable and manages to connect with his audience throughout the film. Why is this so you may ask? For me, it's the fact that John McClane is simply a normal guy. Die Hard isn't about a man who has bulging muscles running around a building, snapping necks and gunning people down in a dirty, gory blood bath. This is a man who is trying to survive the night, showing emotion and compassion every step of the way. And funnily enough, in 1988 when this film was released this type of action film was considered risky for the studios to make due to their leading man alone. One fact I discovered was that prior to Die Hard being made actor Bruce Willis had never done an action film before. Naturally casting him paid off and this film forever changed the way we see action movies.<br/><br/>The performance by Alan Rickman as the film's remorseless villain is easily one of my favourite performances from the actor. He's a character who is not necessarily full of intentions to be needlessly harmful or violent to others but when something doesn't go to his plan or when people get in his way, he is quite scary. His fearless tone and firm authority is some of the biggest strengths within this film.<br/><br/>As a plot, the film gives its audience a great setup. John McClane's plane lands and with a little discussion with the person next to him on the plane and by chatting to the driver taking him to his destination, the film gives the audience all the details we require. This way of communicating to the audience is awesome and never feels forced. Once John McClane witnesses the building being taken over by bad guys we have a full understanding of what the stakes are for our leading hero and the stress level for an audience member is cranked to 11. As for the film's action it still remains a total blast, even in 2019. Die Hard is loaded with countless action moments and cheesy one liners which are still quoted by many today.<br/><br/>While I love the film's audio and action sequences, unfortunately the film's 4k transfer did disappoint me ever so slightly. During certain fight scenes you easily tell when the film has used a stunt double, clearly seeing it is not Bruce Willis, but this is to be expected when watching a classic film on the premium disc format.<br/><br/>Overall, if you told me you had never seen Die Hard before I will stare at you and raise my eyebrows. Die Hard is an action film that should be watched by all. Not necessarily because it's a perfect film, but simply because it's a fun action flick which changed action films on the big screen forever.

","Okay, here we don't have to say anything. We are faced with a mister film, a film that, despite its age, always remains an absolute must of the action cinema and also an absolute cult of the 80s, together with Lethal Weapon and Predator, which are also strong pieces and anch they unforgettable films of those years.<br/><br/>But what I love a lot about the film is the use of Beethoven in the most important and important scenes of the film. His Ninth Symphony, written in 1824, when he was now faced with death and was very much destroyed by his deafness, which once upon a time replied about it being happy to be deaf ('' Oh! How happy should I now be, had I my full sense of hearing ''), is still an absolute masterpiece of classical music and is first used as the main theme of the absolute cult Kubrickian A Clockwork Orange, which, unlike this cornerstone of action cinema, it also contains the overwhelming final part, which expresses the joy of life, as well as a violence not really of the body, but of the soul.<br/><br/>So I think that Die Hard is a '' Clockwork Orange '' but on the contrary and that still pays homage to it and gives it the tribute it deserves, for having inspired one of the most monumental films of all time.<br/><br/>And let me add, in the face of the haters, that this is A CHRISTMAS FILM, and it is still the toughest one today. Therefore, yippie kay kee everyone!"

","Review:
'Die Hard' is a 1988 American action thriller film directed by John McTiernan. It is based on Roderick Thorp's novel 'Nothing Lasts Forever',
This is the ultimate standard when it comes to action movies. 'Die Hard' is a beloved action film and it's easy to see why.
The film follows off-duty New York City Police Department officer John McClane (Bruce Willis) who is caught in a Los Angeles skyscraper during a heist led by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman).
The acting on all accounts is pretty close to perfect, even by the side characters. Although you do go to this movie to see Bruce Willis and Alan Rickman. Bruce Willis is awesome as John McClane. He's a smartass with a distinct disdain for being given orders, but McClane's also clever, and knows how to keep cool under pressure. He is more than the stereotypical tough guy hero. Alan Rickman's performance as Hans Gruber went down in history as one of the greatest villains portray in an action movie and will continue to do so for a long time.
As I was writing this, I was thinking to myself that I didn't want to give it a 5-star rating. But, there simply are no weak spots or dull moments in the film. Is ""Die Hard"" one of the best overall movies ever made? Probably not. But it's undeniably one of the best action movies ever made.
Overall, I forgot how much I loved this movie and I'm so glad I revisited it for the holiday season. I'm definitely adding this one to my collection, and I highly recommend it to t=all movie lovers.
5/5"

","John Mctiernen's Die Hard has become a classic today. Featuring all out action but with some ingenuine characters and pacing of the highest order Die Hard is one of the best action films ever made, and never equaled. Willis plays John Mclane- a cop, visiting his ex-wife in Los Angeles. Trapped in a building taken over by terrorists this is a nonstop 90-minute action ride from atop the Nakatomi building, a towering skyscraper. Bruce Willis became a superstar courtesy this film and John Mctiernan solidified his status as an alpha action filmmaker. A lot of things have been said about Die Hard, and suffice to say this film has permeated popular culture today and one sitting will show you why. This is great filmmaking. Action, Characters, Top notch pacing- if only every director used this template. If you are among the very rare who haven't seen Die Hard yet (!!!), I suggest you finish reading and order a DVD copy."

","Let's make a travel in the seventies and eighties !! We have in the USA two actors: Sylvester Stallone who begins his career with Rocky (1976),Rocky II (1979), Rocky III(1982), First Blood (1982), Rambo,first Blood II (1985) and Rocky IV (1985).And Arnold Schwarzenegger,some years later with Terminator (1984),Preadtor 1987 and Red Heat (1988).
Bruce Willis begin really his career with ""Moonlightning"" where he plays a detective role.Then comes a good comedy ""Blid date"" with Kim Bassinger.
And then comes in 1988 ""Die Hard"" directed by John Mc Tiernan.All know the story of this film.And it's a great success !!
A new action action heroe has born: it's name is John Clane, a very tenacious policeman,who will fight against terrorists in a great building.
From then begins the Die Hard saga with Bruce Willis: Die Hard 2:die harder (1990), Die Hard with a vengeance (1995) and two others films more.
Altough I prefer ""Die hard with a vengeance"" I enjoyed very much ""Die Hard""

I've seen many hostage films but this one for me stands out the most because while i was watching this, even though its old i felt like i was in the movie and the suspense scenes were very intense and also a lot of intense moments. This is just a classic enough said. Some of the one liners are kind of cringey but i mean its late 80's so you got have them. A very good story and it was very entertaining and not boring, but some times it can be a bit tedious but its a hostage movie so you have to expect that. The blood and gore was actually kind of surprising how good it was and so was all the special effects. A very decent movie that you should watch, very good and is best when watched on a nice December night!!!!"
"HotToastyRag","7","0","0","16 June 2019"," Iconic action classic
","Is there anyone out there who hasn't seen Die Hard? It's an American staple in the universally loved genre of action movies, so unless you really don't like them, you've probably seen it. I'll tell you a secret: I fell asleep the first time I watched it. Thanks to the magical DVD player and the boxed set of Die Hard DVDs my dad bought, there've been ample opportunities to rectify my mistake and watch the movie again.<br/><br/>In this Bruce Willis classic, action, tense drama, comedic one-liners, and Christmas are all mixed together to make a winning combination. Walking barefoot on broken glass might not be the type of scene you want to watch him in during the holidays, but Die Hard has been added to many people's Christmas movie traditions. He plays the iconic policeman John McLane-with an iconic catchphrase that isn't appropriate to write out or say in front of children-who, on Christmas Eve, winds up fighting the scary Alan Rickman, a German terrorist who takes a building full of people hostage, instead of reconciling with his wife, which was his original plan for the evening.<br/><br/>Sometimes the old action flicks wind up becoming cheesy over time. While I'm not one to call 1988 an ancient time, this movie has had time to settle, and even among the young, impatient audiences of today, it's still enjoyed and entertaining. When James Shigeta says, ""You'll just have to kill me,"" he's not saying anything new; hostages have always whimpered to villains that they don't have the needed information, and the villains always shrug and let them live. In Die Hard, Alan Rickman shrugs and follows James's suggestion. It's iconic, funny, terrible, and makes Alan both a wonderful and frightening villain. Get ready to start quoting both the hero and the villain, and you're guaranteed to have a ""yippe ki-yay"" of a good time."

","A cop's visit to his ex-wife in another city turns into a terrorist takeover of a hotel building. Armed with only a handgun, what will he do to save his wife taken hostage?<br/><br/>True to its' genre, the premise is simple. yet there are entertaining and peaceful twists to it. The film is a ride. The great direction really gets you involved. The developed and varying characters give depth to the plot, a depth that most action flicks miss.<br/><br/>The action is well timed and the effects are spectacular, especially when given that this was filmed back in 1988. The way this film pulls off realism and suspension of disbelief is noteworthy. The hero is not just some bullet-proof goof that never gets shot but actually makes mistakes and gets hurts. The action is messy and people get grimy and dirty. The violence and blood is just enough to avoid turning the film into a child-friendly flick, nor a unreal gore-fest.<br/><br/>One might be put off by Bruce Willis being the star of the film but he pulled off the role rather well. Well enough that that shot him to stardom. I'm glad they didn't star their first choice, Sylvester Stallone. The other notable acting is by Alan Rickman who played the villain Hans. The performance turned Hans into a very believable character who is not prone to over-the-top dramatics that are increasingly common in the action genre.<br/><br/>Despite all the praise however, the film lacks some of the seriousness that a hostage situation should entail. The presence of some easily noticeable mistakes doesn't help either. I won't call it the best action flick ever but don't let that overshadow the fact that it has a quintessential quality to it. Enough to call it a milestone in this cinema genre. Whether you enjoy action flicks or not, this is something that deserves a watch."

","John Mctiernen's Die Hard is considered one of the benchmark of action cinema and one can see why. Its an exhilarating, brilliantly paced actioner, taking place in one building, and emphasizing not shootouts and carnage (though they are present) but character development. We side with John Mclane because we relate not just with his plight but also his persona. He is a reluctant hero. Similarly the devilish Hans Gruber isn't your typical cookie cutter villain and with an amazing enactment by the great English actor Alan Rickman you almost side with his cunningly laid out plan. The action is amazing but it is punctuated by enough character development and plot points so as to not make it seem like the plot is constructed for the action scenes- as is the case with most action films. John Mctiernen is a great filmmaker. With Predator, Die Hard and The Thomas Crown Affair he had already cemented his reputation as a director of action and this film is perhaps the best example of it."

","What is there not to love about this film. An ordinary cop, goes to his estranged wife's Christmas Work Party, and gets caught up with a load of bad guys all in real time (well maybe not the airport time, but thereafter) !<br/><br/>The beginning is a little slow, the bad guys don't make their grand entrance until 22mins , but as with most films, it is setting things up for later. When is gets going the pace of the rest of the film (around another 1hr 40mins) is pretty non stop and doesn't drag at all.<br/><br/>Willis puts in a great performance. Very believable acting, with a full range of emotions.... happiness, anger, hatred, despair, love and tears all in two hours.<br/><br/>Rickman puts in quite a threatening and comical performance, and his character has an array of henchmen at his disposal.<br/><br/>Well acted and we'll paced, gritty with a smuttered of light relief from leads and often the supporting cast in the shape of Sgt Powell and his far less competent superiors.<br/><br/>Withstands multiple viewings. An all round excellent film, but is it a Christmas film ?? The debate will go on ;)"

","Despite being released 30 and a half years ago, I never saw Die Hard until last night. I have zero regrets whatsoever about watching it, and got quite a kick observing how movies like White House Down and Skyscraper borrow from it. I WON'T touch on the stupid argument over whether or not Die Hard is a Christmas movie.<br/><br/>It's Christmas Eve. NYPD officer John McClane (Bruce Willis) arrives in LA to see his estranged wife and kids. As he waits for the Christmas party at his wife's workplace to finish, a group of terrorists led by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) quickly take over the building and take the guests as hostages. McClane, however, manages to evade the crims without them realising he exists. The crooks are after the business owner's bonds - worth quite a lot of money - and murder him after he refuses to give them the codes to the vault. McClane must try and alert the authorities and at the same time stay one step ahead of the crooks - and kill/defeat them.<br/><br/>It's a highly fun and exciting action movie. Be warned that it's rather violent with a LOT of swearing (especially the F word) & is NOT suitable for (pre-teen) children. Some might consider the early parts of the movie scary. I love the tension and even the occasional humour in the movie. As mentioned, it was highly amusing spotting where Roland Emmerich and Rawson Marshal Thurber mimicked Die Hard."

","Most movie fans will agree on one thing, and that's how ""Die Hard"" is just about the perfect action movie: It's got a reliable, charismatic Bruce Willis in the lead role, kicking everybody's teeth in every step of the way but never coming off as anything less than honorable. It's got the great Alan Rickman in a priceless, legendary performance as Hans Gruber, delighting in every syllable of dialogue like a smirking snake with great fashion style. It's got terrific supporting players, from Bonnie Bedelia to Reginald VelJohnson and a pitch-perfect William Atherton, among many standouts. It's got an entertaining pace and a consistently elevated level of tension, not to mention a number of surprising plot points and economically deployed action set pieces that rock the audience every so often. Director John McTiernan has a great grasp of mainstream conventions and how to play along while subtly subverting them, keeping the audience on its feet and cheering for its many heroes. There's just nothing like ""Die Hard."""

","To say this movie is my favourite is an understatement. My view count must be at 50+ and I have inadvertently learned every scene, word and moment over time. I probably watched this movie a little to early for my age (don't we all right?) and that's where the love for this movie began.<br/><br/>I can't remember the specifics as to why it was this movie that gained my affection, but I guess it was Bruce Willis' iconic New York Police Officer, John McClane, from the moment he walked off the plane, smoking his cigarette the way he did, I knew he oozed cool.<br/><br/>So with that being said, 'Die Hard' follows the story of John McClane who has travelled to Los Angeles intending to reconcile with his wife Holly, who had moved there 6 months prior to start a new job at the Nakatomi Plaza.<br/><br/>After arriving at the party that was being held at the Nakatomi Plaza to see Holly, the party is interrupted by the Arrival of German terrorists who intend on stealing the $640 million in bearer bonds which are held in the Plazas volt. The German terrorists are lead by Hans Gruber, which at the age of 41, was surprisingly Alan Rickman's first movie role.<br/><br/>Filled with excellent wit and typical 80's action, it quickly became a pacesetter for what action movies should aspire to be, its spawned 4 sequels to date, but none of which beats this brilliant movie.<br/><br/>I end on a question, is Die Hard a Christmas movie?! It's hard for me to say as I'd watch it at any time of the year, so it's best to leave that answer to personal preference.<br/><br/>Yippee Ki Yay!"

","Die Hard has become a cultural phenomenon of the action genre since its release, and with the releases of its four and counting sequels. Having finally watched the film for the first time, one can see as to why the film is as praised and beloved as it is.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis brings the charisma, and overall do-whatever in his character of John McClane that his overall presence is what carries the film, which turned him into the action star we saw in his career.<br/><br/>As for the film, since it is quite lengthy in running time, there are enough action scenes to entertain. Along with campy one liners from Bruce Willis, and other likable supporting characters including a limo driver, and officer helping McClane.<br/><br/>Though the plot is quite standard, and somewhat stalls at points, the film does have enough punch to elevate.

","This film made Bruce Willis into a bonafide star. High Octane and directed deftly by the great John Mcteirnen Die Hard is one of the greatest action movies ever made. Die Hard represents the class of modern action pictures and the standard by which they must be judged. Few films falling into the ""mindless entertainment"" genre have as much going for them as this movie. Not only is it a thrill-a-minute ride, but it has one of the best film villains in recent memory, a hero everyone can relate to, dialogue that crackles with wit, and a lot of very impressive pyrotechnics. The acting from Willis and Alan Rickman as the main villain Hans Gruber is amazing and totally meshes with the tone, feel and appeal of the time it was made.

","Just re watched this film and I can't believe how well made it is and how it stands the test of time. Just like Predator another McTiernan masterpiece this film hits all the right notes.
To make an action film that blends so many layers is a real skill pulled off with real aplomb by the entire film crew.
Putting Bruce Willis as an ordinary cop as a one man army against highly trained mercenaries and an intelligent mastermind played with enormous relish by the sadly missed Alan Rickman shouldn't have worked.
By setting it in a towering skyscraper it allows John Mclane to move around undetected and protected by its sheer size and allows each separate action beat build to a big climax at the end.
The helicopter sequence where two gunships weave there way around buildings at low altitude is thrilling even now.
The soundtrack as with all memorable movies is fantastic. Again as with Predator the characters all get fleshed out bar some of the terrorists who really could've been anybody.
Bruce Willis is excellent here and only got the part after more famous musclebound actors gave it a pass.
This turns out to be the films strength as what could've been a Schwarznegger or Stallone one man army that stretched credibility turned into a believable grounded ordinary man doing his job. Watch Skyscraper with Dwayne Johnson and then this and you'll see everything wrong and why everything was right with this.
In fact Jason Bourne and Daniel Craig's James Bond owe their characters to this film.
Yes you can be highly trained and brave and tough but also show vulnerability as Willis does here with his scenes with Bonnie Bodelia and Reginald Veljohnson.
Where the film really excels though is the fabulous dialogue between Rickman and Willis.
Hans Gruber is a truly frightening and calculating and ruthless terroist who has a false charm that turns into a cold hearted killer at a moments notice and his evil is well pitted against Willis as an everyman cop thrust into a situation he shouldn't be in.
Watch this as this a classic action movie which really hasn't been bested since"
"one-nine-eighty","8","0","0","19 October 2018"," One Tower, One Terrorist Plot, One Man. The bar by which other action films are judged.
","An outstanding action/thriller film from 1988, whose power still serves as a bench mark for which other action films are judged. John McClane (Bruce Willis) is New York cop who's visiting his estranged wife, Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) for Christmas in Los Angeles. While working for the Nakatomi Corporation in one of the landmark skyscrapers, Holly, is going by her maiden name of Holly Gennaro - however, this is least of McClane's problems. A European terrorist cell, headed up by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) infiltrates the tower and puts it on lock down - nobody comes in, and nobody goes out. The intention of the well-orchestrated cell; is to rob them of millions of dollars' worth of bonds, but camouflage the theft by appearing to be an out and out terrorist threat. As John wasn't expected at the party and isn't on the staff list he's able to go missing, but with no help due and no way of gaining entry to the building he is alone to face off against Hans and his men.<br/><br/>The film is tight, electrifying and tense at different times, while still having a heart and a sense of humour along the way. There isn't much wasted screen time at all and it's a testament to the director and writers that the pace and feel of the film is top notch. There may be plot holes and mistakes occasionally, but these can quite easily be ignored or forgotten due to the sheer magnitude of what is unfolding on screen, either on an epic scale, or in tight and claustrophobic situations. While other action films relying on action, strength or bullets to find a resolution, this film forces McClane to use his brains, cunning and guile to advance. To be completely honest, McClane isn't an archetypal action hero, he's an average Joe, and this makes his character more lovable. The use of brains and guile also same applies to Rickman's character; Gruber is cold and calculating - just when you think McClane has won a situation, it turns out the Gruber is one step ahead or has an ace in the hole. Delivered with sneering grit and hatred Gruber is a proper Machiavellian character, the kind is the perfect yang to McClane's Ying. Instead of just telling people he's smart, Gruber delivers on this and quite often out foxes McClane, forcing him to rethink and re-approach the situation. The casting of these two roles above everyone else in the film is fantastic.<br/><br/>Spawning a series of sequels, the Die Hard movie isn't just the best of its follow up's, it's actually the bar by which films these days are judged. I read some film reviews and it's common to read something along the lines of: ""The is Die Hard, in a submarine"", or ""if Die Hard took place in a football stadium"". It's a testament to the quality of the film that 30 years later it stands tall as one of the absolute finest action films of modern cinema.<br/><br/>It wouldn't be fair for me to award anything lower than an 8 out of 10 for this epic."

"jocolina","10","0","0","23 September 2018"," An unbeatable classic of the action genre
","A classic, according to my Literature teacher in high school, is a work worthy of being imitated. That is Die Hard. I was a teenager when the film premiered. I went to the theater with a friend and very low expectations, since I am more a sci-fi guy than action one. When I left the theater, I was like ""Wow, this was a thing"" and became an instant fan of the franchise. I recommended this movie to all my friends telling them that it was different than other action movies of that time. One of these differences was how the hero suffers the continuous wounds and ends as a complete mess. In the scene when John McClane extracts a piece of glass from his foot, you can feel the pain of the protagonist. The trope of a standard guy against the odds was born with this film.
Another high point is the villain. I know more Alan Rickman for this role (Hans Gruber) than the one in Harry Potter. A charming, polite and smart antagonist is more appealing than a guy that simply hates the world. I enjoyed the humor of the movie with simple situations like the requirement of Hans of releasing a terrorist of a unknown group. His partner shrugs when listens to Hans and he told him: ""I read about them in Time"".
I am aware that the later releases of the franchise don't surpass this movie, but I enjoyed all of them. In my opinion, this a breaker of the action films genre."
"stevensonger-05079","9","0","0","21 September 2018"," An action lover's film
","The 1980s' classic, Die Hard, is an action-lover's film. It's a film full of intense stand-off scenes, explosions, and suspense like every big-budget action movie should. It follows the smartass and heroic cop, John McClane, who has no problem refusing orders, so he can do what's right and save his wife. 
The film opens on Christmas Eve, where the New York City cop, John McClane has flown to L.A. to visit his estranged wife and hopefully patch up his failing marriage at her office Christmas party in the Nakatomi tower. The plot takes a turn when a group of international terrorists, led the sinister antagonist Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman), take control is the tower to steal $640 million dollars' worth of bearer bonds from the company's vaults. 
Meanwhile, John McClane is taking out the terrorists one by one in an effort to save his wife and the hostages in the tower. 
Director John McTiernan uses screen time very effectively by cutting away from big moments and watching a character's reaction leaving it to the audience to wonder what is going on, a tactic popularized by Alfred Hitchcock to create suspense. As Gruber and his gang of terrorists make their way into the building, guns in hands and arrive on the party floor, we do not see the moment they take control. Instead, we see McClane, barefoot and wearing an undershirt, with his reaction to the gunfire as he runs to the stairs looking for a safe floor. We then cut back to the party where Gruber has already taken control of Nakatomi tower. 
McTiernan also uses many low-angle views of John McClane to show how he is a powerful character and close up shots so we as the audience is able to feel his emotions throughout the film. The use of wide shots in Die Hard allows us as the audience to feel like we are there with John McClane on his journey to save his wife by seeing the dark environment he is in and what his surroundings are. There are very few scenes where with a lot of light. Since the movie takes place at night, it provides a darker ambiance that isn't often associated with ""Christmas"" movies but fits well with action movies. 
The suspense in this film is also fueled by classical music in scenes where something big is about to happen. Besides using a classical score throughout the film, there is a string quartet playing when the terrorists first arrive on the floor and Beethoven's ""Ode to Joy"" is being played when the terrorists finally manage to open the vault. 
While the plot of this film is composed mainly of McClane neutralizing the terrorists and saving the people of the tower, there is a smaller and more important story going on: a man who just wants to be with his wife and kids on Christmas and is willing to kill to get his family back together. This subplot provides John McClane with the persuasion and drive to stop at nothing to fight off the terrorists. 
While parts of the story do not seem believable like McClane falling down an elevator shaft and grabbing onto a small ledge to save himself, the story is believable enough to keep the audience engaged and wondering what will happen next to McClane and Gruber and the rest of the people in the building. Also, with the extensive use of melodrama and action in this movie, there isn't a dull moment between the cynical Hans Gruber and the heroic John McClane who treks around Nakatomi tower barefoot, even on broken glass."

"metalgear-25259","8","0","0","14 June 2018"," The Reason Die Hard Is The Best Film In The Series...
","I guess we could go down the 'Bruce Willis is in his prime here' path or even Alan Rickman is the perfect bad guy. But really this film excels beyond the average action film and it's sequels due to the fact it's in a contained, restricted environment where only stealth and quick thinking can secure the advantage against the odds. This scenario ramps up tension when there's little chance of escape. Unlike the following films which diluted the tension somewhat by allowing John McClane to run around freely or going on chaotic vehicle chases.
 Bruce Willis wisecracks become the light in the darkness in Die Hard. Including his lighter that leads him down ventilation shafts. The action is purposeful and tense. Each fight there's a reward to be had for success which helps to heighten the action suspense. Ammo is limited and our hero really doesn't want to be where he is.
 All in all Die Hard becomes an action, suspense, thriller where the outcome isn't looking positive and the underdog faces some strict odds in a claustrophobic scenario. A tension filled, thinking man's action film is what results here. And something which is rarely achieved to this day."

DIE HARD is really a masterfully crafted action film which stays true to not just its genre and subject, but to all my expectations as well. It really deserves all the praise it has received in these years.<br/><br/>One of the most charming things about DIE HARD is its protagonist John McClane played excellently by Bruce Willis. No matter how greater the peril, the hero always stays cool and makes you like him even more. Believe me, John McClaine's character is the redefinition of heroism at its best and coolest!<br/><br/>The action is splendid. Every single action sequence is exciting, spectacular and worth watching again and again. There are a lot of intense moments which succeed in building and further holding the attention. The cinematography is also decent. Another great thing is that amidst all the action and thrill, the director has spared some time for natural humor and a lot of memorable one liners.<br/><br/>The screenplay is excellent and so is the editing. The film never seems to bore and holds the attention for the most part. Some bonds which the protagonist forms with supporting characters is a complete treat to watch. This is one film which you'll never regret watching again and again, given the powerful execution which has rendered it as a multiple-time watch.<br/><br/>There's no doubt why it's one of the greatest action movies of all time.

Die Hard 1 is fast-paced, thrilling, has a few corny lines (but not that many) and the directing and editing is perfect and it's an intense plot.<br/><br/>I mentioned on one of my other reviews that ""Die Hard 4.0"" is the best one, it is still entertaining, but it's a little bit flashy compared to this original, Die Hard 1 has a gritty in your face vibe."

","Remains a stone-cold action classic even by modern movie standards. The premise is widely inventive, the action is always tense, the comedy is on-point, and the cast is top-notch all around. The highlights are by far the charismatic Bruce Willis and ""always awesome in everything"" Alan Rickman, who have a fantastic hero- villain dynamic that the franchise would never quite capture again. The definitive ""Christmas"" movie for action fans everywhere.<br/><br/>When terrorists take the staff of a hi-tech skyscraper hostage during a Christmas Eve party, a lone New York cop trapped in the building with them fights for survival while trying to foil their plans. Die Hard was a watershed moment in the evolution of the action movie, and was genre defying in that the heroes usually tended to have everything under control in action movies previous to this, while a blood soaked and desperate John McClane always seems one step away from defeat. This makes for some very suspenseful action and Willis' charismatic performance rightly elevated him to mega stardom. It has its faults, namely in the soapy back story of he and his wife and especially the ridiculous nonsense about his would be partner Al and his holstered pistol. These are minor points however as the quips are funny, the action beautifully choreographed and its a thrill ride that has dated surprisingly well. One of THE classic action movies."

","Die Hard was released in 1988. It stars Bruce Willis (action giant Arnold Schwarzenegger was considered as well). It was directed by John McTiernan who previously directed Predator and would go on to direct The Hunt For Red October and Die Hard With A Vengeance. Bruce Willis is a great action hero. Not only is he able to kick ass but he is a real person that you can relate to. You like this guy and you care for him. Making the action more thrilling and suspenseful as you don't want him to die. The plot is nice and simple, giving the narrative a sense of claustrophobia as there is not much space to hide. Die Hard still holds up as a great, fun and suspenseful action film. It has great characters, a fun plot and amazing action scenes."

","Preposterous, ridiculous, and silly, this exciting action flick will nevertheless get your pulse racing.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis as the foul mouthed John McClane gives a career defining performance, matched by an excellent turn from Alan Rickman. The film never tries to create believable human beings; instead we are invited to marvel at McClane's banter laced heroics as he kills each terrorist. They're only terrorists, so we can unashamedly enjoy each demise with glee.<br/><br/>It's action set pieces are put together with aplomb. John McTiernan paces the film brilliantly, interspersing breathless action with humour and reflection. However, it's not remotely believable. The tension that any suspension of disbelief would create is missing. We know what's going to happen from the outset. An all American action hero like McClane predetermines the ending.<br/><br/>It's a film you can happily revisit. The excitement isn't generated by tension or doubt, it's caused by expertly created pyrotechnics, and excessive & ridiculous heroics. A solid actioner that spawned many inferior copycats.

","I have loved this movie ever since I was eight years old even though back then I only understood action. Now since growing up I have grown to like the film more because of the great plot, the cast, and all the memorable action. The story is about John who is having trouble with his marriage comes to see his wife Holly who he discovers she used another last name to get the job. So he isn't in a good mood to start out with. He gets in a fight with her, but before that there is this idiot Ellis who is trying to hit on Holly and take her out to dinner. So she has to go to a conference then she said she would be right back. Then, we see these guys come in kill the guy and one of the guys takes over the job. The memorable villain here is Hans played by Alan Rickman who is a great actor. They take everyone above hostage while John sees what they are doing and slips away.

","''Die Hard'' is the one movie wich gave meaning to following movies like ''Speed'', ''Passenger 57'', ''Air Force One''. Yeah, trapped heroes.<br/><br/>A tired L.A cop, John McClane, is visiting his wife at a christmas party in the huge Nakatomi-building where she works. They have a certant complicated past (she uses her real name Gennaro), but this will be the twist in their relationship. Meanwhile german terrorists led by mr.Evil, super bad guy Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) is planning to take over the building for reasons unknown (so far in the story). After some introductions and an argue that McClane finds quite simular to other memories from the past, the terrorists takes the building over and holds a number of people as hostage. McClane realizes that one of the hostages is his wife, so he hides in the building (without any socks or shoes) to fight the bad guys. After a while the policeman Al Powell and a number of others police forces, including the F.B.I, gets involved from the outside. Sgt. Powell creates intimate relations with John McClane on a radio while all the other policemen seem to be nothing but idiots.<br/><br/>John McTiernan directed ''Die Hard'' in 1988 and it became a hit that bombed all over the world. This is the breakthrough of Bruce Willis, the tragedy is that he had to get stuck with the role until now (''The Sixth Sense''). The movie is rapid, packed with explosions, very violent and still quite charming. John McClane is the cool guy who responses to Hans just as clever and cocky as any rebellian teenager to a teacher. Best of them all is Alan Rickman as Hans. He is one of the best actors in the world, even though I have seen way too little of his work, but of what I've seen it is superb. Seeing him in an actionmovie might seem strange for some, but for those who grew up with this movie we'll never stop reacting to ''Die Hard'' when we see him.<br/><br/>I will never forget the first time I watched ''Die Hard''. When the movie was over, I could'nt move. I was stunned, and through the entire day I WAS John McClane shooting terrorists in a sky scraper. ''Die Hard'' is to date one of my favorite movies. Except from ''Lethal Weapon'' this is probably the best action adventure to get. This is simply the obvious action classic.<br/><br/>9/10"

There is the famous scene with Willis jumping off the top of the building with an explosion behind him. But, if you thought that was exciting wait to you see how McTiernan continues that sequence and gets you to the edge of your seat.

It keeps your heart racing for most of the time, but the big problem with the film is that some minor characters take away from the intensity. About half way through, the cops show up on the outside of the building and are so poorly written that they end up acting ignorant and just get in the way of the non-stop action.

Truly the secondary menace has to be Hans Gruber (wonderfully played by Alan Rickman), leader of the terrorist group who take over the Nakatomi Building where John has come to meet up with his estranged wife.

How refreshing to find that even the damsel-in-distress, (who isn't a supermodel in any way,) has the chance to throw a few punches. And the audience actually wants the police and the FBI to die, because they aren't the good guys.  Die Hard is the reason why action movies sell, the way Scream is the way teen movies sell.

Willis, as New York detective John McClane, has a great time outwitting Gruber and his cronies until the explosive, unforgettable climax.<br/><br/>As far as plot, there are some solid surprises and co-stars Bonnie Bedelia, Alan Rickman, and Reginald Veljohnson make sure this is not a one-man show. The only problem I have is that the movie makes the chief of police, played by Paul Gleason, look like a self-centered idiot who gets off on seeing McClane suffer.

I suddently got nervous when i realised that everything but the best action movie ever would be a disappointment. And when i turned off the lights and pressed PLAY i could almost fade out. After i saw the plane-scene ( ''Fist with your toes''-classic line ) i started to realise what it was about. And when i one hour later saw Bruce Willis run around with a machine-gun i was convinced. When the credits where gone i couldn't move. What a movie! When i took control over my self i WAS John McClane with a machine gun in my hands. And it was I who kicked Karls ass, and shot Hans in the head. After that I was the one who saved MY wife and hugged Al Powell. Then I drew away in Argyles Limo.

","This movie is undeniably an intense action roller-coaster. Hans Gruber and his group of ""terrorists"", seize control over the Nakatami corporations sky scraper to get their hands on the 600 million dollars worth of ""stuff"" in the Nakatami vault. This is on christmas eve, and God wouldn't let villains get away with that, would he? of course not, because New York cop John McClane, has come to visit his wife, who works for the Nakatami corp. The corporation is holding a party for its employees, and when the terrorists barge in on the party, McClane conveniently is out of sight in one of the offices. So you know what happens next, its a lone cops struggle against a pack of no good germans. The germans are of course stereotyped, with blond hair and blue eyes, and a sense for detail planning. In fact, the whole movie is all about stereotypes, the FBI agents are depicted as morons, the black cop outside is neglected by his superiors etc. Other than a few discusting features, Die Hard is good fun."
"Howlin Wolf","10","0","0","26 April 2001"," An undisputed classic. (SPOILERS)
","The best of the trilogy (although ""DHWAV"" is also great), ""Die Hard"" succeeds because its characters all seem like real people; as opposed to indestructible superheros and moustache-twirling villains.  John MClane has an argument with his wife just before all hell breaks loose, but we don't lose sympathy with him even though he's a bit of a jerk, and the scene where he tells Al Powell to give a message to Holly is extraordinarily touching. Time has obviously been spent on the script so it's not just a ragtag collection of one-liners (There are a few priceless ones in there, though) This has a great effect on the viewer because it gives us an actual story rather than a string of setpieces.<br/><br/>   I don't need to go on about the performance of Bruce Willis.  He IS John MClane.  He's also a very under-rated actor who just happens to have been in his share of clunkers.  Rickman is superb as the nefarious bad guy Hans Gruber; at times he seems like he's chewing the scenery (when the script calls for it) but at other times he's the perfect example of underplayed menace.  Others of note are Paul Gleason (""The Breakfast Club"") and Hart Bochner as the slimy Ellis.  Particularly good on the side of the terrorists is Alexander Godunov.  One of my favourite scenes is the almost climactic fight between McClane and Karl.  You really believe that they hate each other as Willis spits out: ""You shoulda heard your brother squeal when I broke his f***in neck!""<br/><br/>   One of the best things about this film is that just when you think a certain scene can't be topped for pure excitement; McTiernan unleashes the next rocket from his arsenal and you are blown away once again.  The last 10 minutes or so (starting from when McClane gets onto the roof) are a delirious whirl of spectacular stunts.  This truly is one action ride you'll never forget.  Show me a better Hollywood action film and I'll call you a liar... It just doesn't get better than this."

","Well yeah, I've seen this movie 3 times yet, and I even liked it the third time.<br/><br/>One of the reasons why I like it, is because the main character is not a godlike macho killer spreading bullets around and killing thousands of bad guys. He (Bruce Willis in his younger days) is just like the guy next door, put in a claustrophobic situation, which gives the whole movie a nice score on credibility. Not too bad for an action movie. Also, the plot is decorated with some cool one-liners and humorous situations.<br/><br/>Maybe the influence of this flick is much larger than one might expect. Lots of today's computer-games are based on ""Die Hard""-alike action. The same weaponry, combat and so on.<br/><br/>Well, i can't exactly tell you why, but I really adore this movie.

","The Last Battle of World War II<br/><br/>As Gorbachev's glasnost and perestroika set in motion the events that would lead to the collapse of both the illusion of Soviet power and the Soviet Union, Hollywood, and in particular the makers of contemporary action movies, had a problem. The Russians (never mind the fact that the Soviets weren't all Russians) were good villains, all sinister accents and sinister brooding looks. For decades they had been led by dour Commies humourlessly taking the salute on May Day. But along came charismatic old Gorby and suddenly the Ruskies were warm, fuzzy huggable allies trying to make a better world. South African apartheid-mongers,  South American drug barons and Arab-world terrorists all stood in for the sinister Soviets  but things weren't the same.<br/><br/>John McTiernan's 1988 `Die Hard' went back to the definitive screen villains  German Nazis. Of course, films featuring Teutonic villainy had been made since World War II, but most of these were marred somewhat by the difficulty of making them contemporary, and the fact that most people know who won World War II. `Die Hard' can be seen as a typical World War II movie.<br/><br/>For those of you who haven't seen the movie, here's a brief synopsis: Bruce Willis plays John McClane, a New York cop who is in Los Angeles to go to a Christmas party with his estranged wife. An unspecified group of German terrorists, led by Hans Gruber (played by Alan Rickman, the man who would later impersonate Eamon de Valera as a pantomime sniveling whinger in Michael Collins) takes over the building where his wife works and holds her and 30 workmates hostage. Willis is left alone in the building and the film essentially is made up of McClane wearing a vest and foiling the terrorists by increasingly spectacular means. See it  even if you make a point of loathing that sort of thing, it is a classic example of what Hitchcock meant by `pure cinema'  a series of brilliant sequences held together by a largely irrelevant `McGuffin' or plot.<br/><br/>Die Hard's villains are loosely defined German terrorists. Ultimately their motivation is financial, but that doesn't really matter  they fit in as ruthless, hyperefficient Aryan ubermenschen sneering at American culture as decadent  in short, the stereotypical Hollywood Nazi. They even have a Oriental gentleman in their party  echoes of the Axis (the benevolent owner of the building is Japanese, who makes a jocular reference to Pearl Harbor) who at one stage unconsciously underlines American pop culture's supremacy by surreptitiously grabbing a Mars bar just before another violent showdown.<br/><br/>The starkest illustration of the clash of cultures is when Hans Gruber engages McClane with the celebrated dialogue:<br/><br/>Hans Gruber:  You know my name but who are you? Just another American who saw too many movies as a child? Another orphan of a bankrupt culture who thinks he's John Wayne? Rambo? Marshall Dillon? Detective John McClane: Was always kinda' partial to Roy Rogers actually. I really dig those sequined shirts.<br/><br/>`Die Hard' retains the values of the World War II morale booster  multiethnic America's can-do spirit and resourcefulness trumps sinister German murderousness and cultural snobbery. The GIs of World War II modeled themselves on Bogart and westerns, lusted after Betty Grable, swung to the sounds of Glenn Miller  in short, they were creatures of their dominant pop culture. Even in the tension of the decisive showdown, McClane goes on to trump Gruber again in the pop culture stakes:<br/><br/>Hans Gruber: This time John Wayne does not walk off into the sunset with Grace Kelly. Detective John McClane: That was Gary Cooper, a**hole<br/><br/>Interestingly, the German the terrorists speak is often grammatically incorrect and meaningless. The German release of the film feature terrorists from `Europe' and the terrorists Hans and Karl have been renamed Jack and Charlie. In the scene where McClane writes down the names Hans and Karl on his forearm, he says ""I'm gonna call you Hans and Karl, just like the two evil giants in the fairy tale."" Later on, he still refers to them as Jack and Charlie.<br/><br/>`Die Hard' taps into the ideal of resourcefulness and independence; of course these ideals are especially strong in America where the pioneer experience is historically recent and important to American self-image. You could even read the film as an illustration of the individualist Objectivism of Ayn Rand; the lone McClane trumps the teamwork of the Germans despite the ineffectual teamwork of the police and FBI outside the building. The efficiency and technical expertise of the Germans is no match for good ol' American can-do.<br/><br/>Another interesting aspect of `Die Hard' is its racial politics. McClane's first contact outside the building is the black Sergeant Powell. McClane's relationship to Sergeant Powell is again typical of the buddy films of World War II. They strike up a relationship on CB radio during the crisis, which extends to warm family reminiscences. Powell has a tragic past; one night he accidentally shot a child and since then has moved to desk duties since he can never bring himself shoot a gun again. In the best tradition of the buddy movie, Powell ultimately overcomes his fear to save the day. Yet another example of redemption through violence.<br/><br/>The terrorists are helped by Theo, a black computer whiz, who is counterpoised by Argyle, a guy ensconced in a limo in the underground car park who ultimately stops him making a getaway. Again one can't help being reminded of the World War II platoon movies where a WASP, a Jew, an Italian kid, an Irish guy, a Native American and a black guy all unite to trump the monotonously Aryan Germans.<br/><br/>World War II was the dominant political and social event of the Twentieth Century. Millions of young men  now elderly  went off to fight, and in many cases witness unimaginable horror, and often killed; and then came back to civilian life. No wonder the themes of World War II are revisited again and again, in surprising locations and in surprising times."

","What is it about this movie...<br/><br/>When looked at individually, each component of the film is well done: the acting, the directing, the script, the music, etc.  When combined, however, these separate parts come together to form a piece of cinematic wonder. While this may sound melodramatic, in reality it is not.  Why do we watch Die Hard over and over, so many years later, even though we know exactly what will happen?  Why do we get that familiar clenching of the gut everytime John McClane picks up a gun?  In essence, this is because, while it may not be new, it is nonetheless always exciting.<br/><br/>This is not so much a review of Die Hard as it is a lavishing of praise. With that one movie, the filmmakers achieved what so many have struggled to do since:  they made the quintessential action movie, and in doing so they changed the audience's level of acceptance as to what a great movie really is.  The attention to detail is remarkable, and evident in every scene. Bruce Willis and Alan Rickman are not so much acting as they are living their roles, so much so that it almost feels as if, years later, they are still locked into their battle, each testing the others' resolve.<br/><br/>This film will forever remain as a testament to what can be accomplished by paying strict attention to detail.  Because of that dedication to the film, we as the audience are left with a finely crafted piece of work, where every scene resonates with an ambience that can only be described as a ""perfect fit"", where no word or movement is given needlessly, and where we see a true hero act in a remarkable situation (and believe everything we see along the way).  I for one will continue to watch this film every time it pops up on cable, for in doing so I know, without a doubt, that I am in for a great ride."
"Motoko","Null","0","0","18 January 1999"," The great-grandaddy of action films.
","This is it. That film. The film that spawned a thousand rip-offs, carbon copies and look-a-likes. There are few films that have created their own genre. Star Wars is the space western, Psycho introduced the slasher and Jaws personifies the 'creature feature.' Every cliche and familiar shot found in their distant relatives can usually be traced back to these founders. But Die Hard created something more. Die Hard didn't just create the action genre. It didn't just give us the one-man-takes-on-impossible-odds scenario. It didn't just give birth to the ordinary guy in the extra-ordinary situation plotline. It introduced a dozen other sequences that are now deemed stock film fillers due to their now over-use. It also totally restructured the Hollywood ideas about feature-length entertainment and made a movie star out of the then unknown Bruce Willis. That, and it was, is and always will be one of the top three action films ever made.<br/><br/>If this seems a little too much like over-adoring, fanboy pap then you're damned right. It is. But few films deserve this much adulation. The film itself is top notch quality entertainment. From McClanes landing at the airport to his drive off into the sunset with Holly at his arm there are enough brilliant scenes, snappy lines and tense sequences to make lesser action films pale into comparison. John McTiernan was a relative unknown coming onto this as well. Yes he'd made Predator and a good film it was too but it loooked cheap and wasn't anything more than a sci-fi version of the silent-stalker horror films that were being churned out by the bucket-full at the time. McTiernan shows his talent in abudance with claustraphobic camerawork evoking the labyrintine tower to perfection and some action pieces that have yet to be bettered by anybody (McClanes slo-mo jump of the roof of the tower is a nomination for best action moment in film history.) The villainous terrorists/robbers are suitably menacing as well with Rickman superb as their ruthless head. But the star of Die Hard is Willis. McClane is the type of hero the cinema crowds had been calling for. One that feels pain but won't be beaten. The kind that deliver a suitable wisecrack just before dropping another evil terrorist. If he wasn't a cop then he'd be another guy like anybody else. For the first time the public had someone to relate to.<br/><br/>But Die Hard was not only vitally important for being an exceptional movie but also for what it led to. Pick any action thriller and you can trace it back to Die Hard. Pick some non-action thriller movies and it will be there too. This was the first film to switch the roles, make the good guy the loner and give the bad guys strength in numbers. It's often copied but rarely duplicated. Only recently with films like Face/Off and The Rock has Hollywood come close to catching that old magic. The sequels couldn't do it and many will come and go before another successor to the throne is found. Until then Die Hard remains what it always has been. Not just a classic. Not just a masterpiece. It is THE action film. The rest simply lay in its wake. Yippee-Kiyay indeed."

","Bruce Willis was a bit of a joke before this film was first released. A TV star from a once successful show, unproven as a movie star, demanding several million to star in a big budget action movie - people were booing and throwing popcorn at the screen when only the trailer was showing. Little did they know... Mr Willis may have made a few suspect choices in his film roles over the years ('North' and, Heaven help us, 'The Bonfire of the Vanities'), but Die Hard was probably the best career move he will make. Ever. James Bond was getting a bit tedious, Rambo was nothing more than an indestructable muscle-bound meathead, the Eighties needed a real action hero. Step forward John McClane. When we first meet him, we immediately know this is a guy we can trust. While James Bond would just sit calmly sipping his cocktail, McClane is tense after a long flight - he's not too keen on flying. This instantly shows that he's mortal and not some sort of machine that is only operative when there are bad guys to despatch. On his drive from the airport, we find out more about his human side. He's a male chauvanist because he doesn't have any real faith in his wife's ability to be independent in her chosen career. The way he talks about her to the driver of his limo tells us that he does genuinely miss her. When he gets to the office block, the fact that Holly is registered under her maiden name hurts his pride leading to an angry (and instantly regrettable) argument later on. In case we were worried that this guy was abit too touchy-feely to be a real hero, we see him briefly spying on an unidentified, naked bimbo in an adjacent building. Our kinda guy!<br/><br/>At first, the bad guys show themselves to be highly efficient, ruthless and very cool (in direct contrast to our all too human hero?). Chief Baddie Alan Rickman puts such a fantastic performance that he nearly walks away with the film (as he did a couple of years later with the Robin Hood movie), but he doesn't quite steal it away from Mr Willis. Polishing off the bad guys whilst uttering a corny pun wearing a vest designed to show off his pecs as much as possible, and injuries that get more severe with each increasingly improbable set-piece, Bruce becomes the action hero blue-print for the next decade. Not only that but the film itself practically invented the 90's big-budget blockbuster two years before that decade had even began. In addition to the splendid performances we have brilliant direction by John McTiernan, a superb score by Michael Kamen, and almost flawless special effects.<br/><br/>The film is not without its bad points: Firstly, would you remove your shoes and socks and ""make fists with your toes"" on the advice of a complete stranger? Didn't think so. You might consider the film to be a little bit far fetched. Well, fair enough. If you want social realism or politics watch an Oliver Stone film. Die Hard is escapism, entertainment and fun. And as such its the best of its kind."
"Davva Robbo","Null","0","0","25 July 2000"," Easily the best action movie of the 80's!
","With assured direction from John McTiernan, a superb score by Michael Kamen and excellent special effects (by pre CGI standards), this film practically re-invented the action movie. And boy did we action fans need it.<br/><br/> James Bond was losing his appeal, Rambo was nothing more than a charmless, mono-syllabic walking machine-gun and Arnie was still in the early days of his rise to the top of Hollywood. The action genre needed help.<br/><br/> That help came in the unlikely form of Bruce Willis. Oh dear.<br/><br/> Since Moonlighting finished, Bruce's big screen output left a lot to be desired up to this point ('Blind Date', anyone?). Some thought it a bit cheeky of our Mr Willis to be demanding a few million dollars to appear as New York cop John McClane. In fact, some US cinema audiences started to jeer and throw popcorn at the screen when the trailer for Die Hard was shown. If only they knew...<br/><br/> Basically, Die Hard turned Bruce Willis into a genuine movie star. In a white vest that gets grubbier by the minute, a snappy gag for every villain despatched and injuries that get more severe with each increasingly improbable set-piece, John McClane became the blueprint for action heroes over the next decade. For the first time in a long while we had an action hero who was human (he's afraid to fly, he gets scared when the villains shoot at him, and most importantly, his marriage is a mess). From the moment we meet him, stressed out after a long plane journey, we know this is a guy we can trust.<br/><br/> Thanks to the sequels, it's hard to imagine anyone but Willis in the role of McClane but there's far more to Die Hard's success than it's leading man. In films like this there is a tendency to make the villains nothing more than cannon fodder. When they first appear in Die Hard, they give the impression of an expertly trained, highly disciplined and well organised team of guys-to-be-shot-by-Bruce. However, as the film progresses, they actually develop individual personalities. Special mentions should go to Clarence Gilyard Jr as Theo, the excitable Technical expert. Also Alexander Gudonov does a wonderfully snarling chief henchman/second-in-command. Last, but certainly not least, Alan Rickman as chief villain Hans Gruber shows exactly why he has since developed a reputation for stealing films right out from under the stars' noses.<br/><br/> Bruce has to work hard to stop Rickman from overshadowing him but he just about pulls it off (unlike Kevin Costner who, apparently, had Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves re-edited so that Rickman's Sherrif of Nottingham didn't wipe Costner's plank Robin off the screen - it didn't work though).<br/><br/> It's not just the characters that makes this film work. The action set-pieces are directed with impeccable style and panache by John McTiernan. This is probably the man we have to thank for action movie that practically re-invented the Big Budget 90's Hollywood Blockbuster two years before that decade had even begun.<br/><br/> That's not to say that film is perfect. Certain aspects of the plot are painfully contrived - ""fists with your toes"". Yeah, right. The police and other law enforcement agencies are worryingly inept, with the obvious exception of Al, Bruce's buddie on the outside. There's also the old ""the villain is dead....whooops, no he isn't"" device at the end which was as much a cliche in 1988 as it is now.<br/><br/>Some people might criticise Die Hard on the grounds that it's too far-fetched. Fair enough, it is. If you want serious social issues and politics, then watch an Oliver Stone movie. If you want brilliant escapism and fantastic entertainment, you should watch Die Hard - it's the best of it's kind"

","Of all the action films to come out of Hollywood in the late 80s early 90s, Die Hard is perhaps the Mother of all of them. There is something strangely comforting about Bruce Willis' role as cop John McClane. We know the plot is quite ridiculous and yet Willis is so believable as the all action anti-hero that we go along with it all.<br/><br/>DH is superior to movies like Lethal Weapon, Terminator, Speed & Mission Impossible because of Willis' charisma & personal charm which is not generally found with actors like Gibson, Arnie & Cruise.<br/><br/>Another bonus about DH is that even though there are a lot of special effects we don't get bombarded with hi-tech unrealistic gadgets & hardware. Everything in the film is played with a genuine style & substance that is such a key factor with any John McTiernan movie. McClaine has to rely on his own wits & spirit for human survival while his contemporaries (Arnie, Cruise etc) can fall back on all those gadgets to get them out of a fix. <br/><br/>
Ably supporting Willis is Alan Rickman, a theatrical actor by nature, but really excels as the rather civilised yet evil German terrorist Hans Gruber, adding a little European style to heaps of American panache.<br/><br/>It sometimes gets bogged down with the buddie-buddie relationship between white cop/black cop, while adding the FBI into the story is more of a distraction than an aid.<br/><br/>DH is still the best of the trilogy, although whether Bruce feels up to donning the White Vest again in DH4 we will have to wait and see.<br/><br/>

Last time I felt excited about an action film was when Lethal Weapon 4 was released or when Die Hard With A Vengeance came out in 1995. It makes me yearn for the days of great stunts, great humor, great villains and of course, real action. I am talking about Die Hard.<br/><br/>The story is pretty simple. John McClane is a New York detective flying to Los Angeles to meet with his estranged wife at a party. She has taken a high-profile job with the Nakatomi Corporation and the party is being held at the unfinished new tower for the company. Things seem to be going alright when disaster strikes. Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) and a team of professional German terrorists have hijacked the building. All entrances are sealed, the tower is patroled by well-armed guards and they are planning to get away with millions of dollars in bonds stored in the building's high-security vault. They have complete control, except for one unforseen factor........John McClane.<br/><br/>As the film progresses, McClane finds himself the unlikely hero (with no shoes on) who must single handedly overpower Hans' team with only his stealth, wits and a little bit of ingenuity. He is not a machine: he is just a cop who won't quit. And the movie is a thrill machine that won't quit.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis, Bonnie Bedelia, Alan Rickman and the entire cast are terrific. The screenplay gives plenty of humor to lighten up the proceedings too. The stunts and direction are superb. This movie is everything one would want in a summer flick.<br/><br/>Trust me: if you haven't seen this movie, run out and rent it now. If you haven't seen it or it's two sequels, pick them up too.

","""Die Hard"" has to be the mother of all terrorist thrillers. Here, you've got one mean cop armed with only a beretta against a group of Euro-trash terrorists, which the battleground is a really tall skyscraper in Los Angeles. What follows is a rip-roaring roller coaster ride with no limits and no mercy.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis plays his arguably most popular trademark character ever as John McClane, a New York cop vacationing in L.A. for the Christmas season to see his estranged wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia), who is attending a party in her office in a skyscraper. John and Holly bicker a little bit, fighting over their decaying marital status, until when a group of terrorists led by a nasty German named Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) and his right-hand man Karl (the scary Alex Godunov) crash the party and demand the code to a hidden vault in the building that contains a huge fortune. So, in true Hollywood fashion, McClane takes on the baddies by upsetting every move they make. Not only does McClane have to worry about the killers, but the LAPD and the feds are also on his case. This leads to one harrowing showdown between cop and criminals.<br/><br/>This film leads a whole line of wannabes that try to imitate the original, and which some were successful. Willis is outstanding because he portrays an action hero who is more human than most characters, and he's more chattier, too. Bedelia also sheds a spark of humanity, as does future ""Family Matters"" star Reg VelJohnson as honest LAPD cop Al Powell. Alan Rickman is ultra sleazy and nasty as the main heavy, a scuzzball with no remorse,"

With its mix of blistering action and white knuckle thrills, Die Hard is the mold that all other action movies should use. I mean this movie is just fantastic. I especially like Willis's performance in this movie. His John Mclane character is terrific, being able to take on terrorists and utter wisecracks at the same time.

","This has to be one of the greatest action films of the 80's. It goes up with the best alongside The Terminator, RoboCop, and Lethal Weapon. This movie should be considered an action classic.<br/><br/>It's the story of New York Cop John McClane who has come out to L.A. to visit his family for Christmas. He goes to his wife's new job which is located in an L.A. highrise for a party. Except who knew that a group of German terrorists would come along and crash the party.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis is cast perfectly as the cop who's in the wrong place at the wrong time. Alan Rickman was superb as Hans Gruber and Bonnie Bedelia did a good job as McClane's wife. There are also some good supporting characters such as Reginald VelJohnson, Alexander Gudonov, Paul Gleason, and William Atherton.<br/><br/>Besides having some of the best action sequences ever filmed it also has the best one-liners ever quoted in a movie(""Happy trails, Hans!"").<br/><br/>
For a slick and action-packed movie, Die Hard is the one to see!<br/><br/>Yippee-Ki-Yay, motherf@#%er!"

","Die Hard(1988) has a very good story line but what it does contain is a feeling of entrapment and some mind bogging action sequences.  The one liners in this movie are very funny and done with a lot of style.  What makes this movie interesting is the violent chess match between Bruce Willis's John and Alan Rickman's Hans.  One thing I didn't understand about the film was why was the Japanese CEO killed and not tortured as he seemed willing to die in order for the terrorists to not get the information they wanted to know.<br/><br/>
Alan Rickman as Hans Gruber is seen in the film as a very cultured and intelligent but dangerous person who is capable of anything.  Die Hard along with Die Hard 2:Die Harder are not only the best in the Die Hard trilogy but also one of the best actions films of the 1980's.  The protagonist is a complete and sympathetic character which is unusually for an action flick of this size.  Die Hard(1988) and its sequel are films that many have worn out without having an understanding of what made the first two movies exciting and mesmerizing to watch."

","6 out of 10<br/><br/>Die Hard's plot has pretty much been the springboard for the action movies we see nowadays.  Basically, a group of terrorists hold lots of civiliant hostage so they can steal some money.  The premise has been done over and over and more elaborately than Die Hard, which uses the simplicity to its advantage.  It's one cop vs. a dozen terrorists, nothing particularly hard on the noggin about that.  While the action scenes are well executed, the movie is constantly shot in darkly lit areas, making some of the shootouts and fistfights harder to make out.  <br/><br/>But most damning of all is the fact that, off the top of my head, I cannot recall a big-studio action film that featured as many annoying supporting characters as the number in this movie.  There are the by-the-book FBI agents, the idiotic police captain (who, when hearing of a body being thrown at a building, actually suggests it may have been a guy who committed suicide), the drug-addled businessman who's out to save his own skin, and the cutthroat, no-mercy reporter who tries exploiting the story even at the risk of the hostages' lives.  It's hard to concentrate on the action when all I can think of is how each of these characters' is going to get his comeuppance.  It's also pretty insulting to see each of these people act stupid only to drive the plot forward."

"Frank-White359","7","3","8","20 June 2011"," great movie from 80's!
","At the end of the Eighties the action movie genre, which had flourished throughout the decade, began to stagnate. Cinema goers had seen enough explosions and gunfights cloned from the same formula made popular by Arnie and Sly. Both of these men were moving in the direction of comedy and action movies needed something new.. something fresh. In stepped John McTiernan and Bruce Willis with DIE HARD. Willis, most famous at the time for the comic T.V. Series 'Moonlighting', made a perfect ordinary-man-in-an-extraordinary-situation action hero. He was believable as John McClane and not immune to being hurt. He bleed and felt pain, a first for the genre. And yet his cool confident delivery of a great wisecracking, intelligent script made him all the cooler. But most credit should go to Director John McTiernan, king of the sophisticated action flick. He made action movies slick, smart and full of pace and wit while never letting up on the bullets, cars and bombs front. Special praise must go out to Alan Rickman too whose performance as chief baddie Hans is to this day one of cinemas finest, moving convincingly from cool, calm and collected to desperate and nervous, never once seeming anything less than utterly ruthless and calculating. Die Hard is a great movie for a number of reasons but adding three dimensions to the action genre is this films finest achievement and anyone who has not sampled its delights before now would be wise to get a copy as soon as possible. But don't see it on T.V. oh no, because it is never without significant and completely unnecessary extra editing for violence and language. Enjoy it on video or DVD if you can, see it in all its original splendor, it is arguably the greatest action film ever made. And then go see the sequels.. they rock too!"
"jamesolio","2","17","88","18 September 2006"," no redeeming value
","This film has almost everything that I despise. I do like the action, explosions, and Alan Rickman since he stars as Severus Snape in the seven Harry Potter flicks. Rickman is excellent at playing the bad guy. Bruce Willis thinks he is so cool; however, but nothing but a fool. So the two stars are for Rickman and the action. The subtraction of eight stars is for the ballooning votes that this movie has been given, the violence, the nudity, the vulgarity, Bruce Willis, the mindless acting by the majority, the length of the film, and finally not giving Rickman more lines. Yes, it's a slight obsession with Rickman as it seems, but I had to think of eight reasons and ran out of ideas. So if you like or love this imbecilic claptrap, you will most likely disagree with me and jump to conclusions while forming stereotypes. I don't blame you. I only wish Hollywood wouldn't contribute to the degenerating of our civilization where people don't care about humans they don't know."

Maybe, this kind of action is just not my cup of tea cause I felt I wouldn't have missed out on anything if I hadn't seen it. It's one of those movies you won't mind watching if you've got 2 hours to kill(no pun intended) but definitely not one that'll make you say ""Wow. I'm glad I watched this."" I guess you can say that's the whole point of the genre but for a movie to have no surprises at all? You have so say that's a dull watch. This movie is only about robbers, and guns and an over-the-top hero. I guess what I missed the most was a smart criminal and/or a smart hero. That, to me, equals a boring action film."

","From director John McTiernan (Predator) comes the first of the highly popular action thriller films with the star of Moonlighting (in his third film, after two failures). It is Christmas Eve, and John McClane (Bruce Willis) has arrived in Los Angeles to see his wife Holly Gennaro McClane (Bonnie Bedelia) who along with his kids he has not seen for six months. Her promotion is what brought her from New York to LA, and she had to move to work in the Nakatomi Plaza, a 40 story building. She has to do a speech at the party going on, and she leaves the room saying she'll be back, and a few minutes later, a group of German terrorists led by mastermind Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) and his right-hand man Karl (Alexander Godunov) enter the building and take everyone on the 30th floor hostage. John manages to get away and hide in the upper building, still under construction, and the terrorists have no idea he is there. Hans takes Holly's boss Joseph Yashinobo Takagi (James Shigeta) and demands he give him the computer code to open the building's safe to steal $640,000,000 in bearer bonds, and Takagi is killed when he refuses, which John witnesses. Technology expert Theo (Clarence Gilyard Jr.) is told to start working on getting the safe opened, which he thinks will take a couple of hours, John meanwhile is trying to alert the LAPD, because the phone lines have been cut. Once the police are there, they prove incompetent under the command of arrogant deputy chief Dwayne T. Robinson (The Breakfast Club's Paul Gleason), and only Sergeant Al Powell (Reginald VelJohnson) on the walkie talkie supports him, so John has to save the hostages alone. There is one part where John meets Hans face to face, but he believes for a tiny while he is a hostage, because he puts on an American accent. Eventually, John manages to help the hostages, stop the robbery, and confront Hans who is holding his wife#s bracelet, but he does fall to his death eventually. Also starring De'Voreaux White as Argyle, William Atherton as Richard Thornburg, Hart Bochner as Harry Ellis, The Living Daylights' Andreas Wisniewski as Tony, Licence to Kill's Robert Davi as Agent Johnson and Grand L. Bush as Agent Johnson. Filled with fantastic action and stunts (some done by Willis himself), great acting, a humorous, wise cracking and admirable hero in the wrong place at the wrong time, a cunning villain, and the great catchphrase, ""Yippee-ki-yay, mother f***er"", this is an essential action thriller. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Sound Effects Editing, Best Visual Effects, Best Film Editing and Best Sound. Bruce Willis was number 35 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Hans Gruber was number 46 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, and the film was number 39 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills. Outstanding!"

"TimBoHannon","6","2","5","10 March 2013"," Remarkably Good Movie in Nearly Every Way
","""Die Hard"" is an ingenious marathon of claustrophobic and acrophobic action. It features superior action, a script sparkling with great lines, stalwart characters in the three biggest roles, high-quality sets, and a neat Michael Kamen musical score. The greatly successful careers of Alan Rickman and Bruce Willis can be traced to ""Die Hard."" Sadly, one recurring mistake prevents it from reaching its awesome potential and ruined the movie for me my first several viewings.<br/><br/>Nearly the whole movie occurs at Nakatomi Plaza, a beautiful property with a skyscraper at its center. On the 30th floor, an innocent Christmas Eve party morphs into chaos upon the arrival of Hans Gruber (Rickman) and his twelve-man squad. While posing as a terrorist taking hostages, the wily Hans really seeks the treasure in Nakatomi's vault. Mr. Gruber has planned one of the truly perfect crimes, except for the one element nobody could have predicted.<br/><br/>Holly McClane (Bonnie Bedelia), who is Nakatomi Corporation's Vice President, has invited her husband John (Willis) to the Christmas party. John is not merely a police officer, but one with exceptional skill and toughness. The terrorists cannot take control of the people quickly enough to prevent McClane's retreat to the unfinished upper floors. With John now roaming in the building, Hans's criminal master plan goes from flawless to critically endangered.<br/><br/>I cannot say much about the action that has not already been said. It is great, no question. Some Arnold Schwarzenegger movies of the time contain more brutal violence. I prefer Indiana Jones or Timothy Dalton's Bond movies for quality, but any superiority those movies have is small. Fans of automatic weapons in movies have plenty to feast on here. Few people know the name Charlie Picerni, who was a stunt coordinator for several famous television shows before working ""Die Hard."" His effort here deserves special mention, as does cinematographer Jan de Bont's. It is no surprise that their careers have been successful since.<br/><br/>LAPD Detective Al Powell (Reginald VelJohnson) joins McClane and Gruber in the trio of main characters. All three rise above the level of average hero, supporter, and villain. ""Die Hard"" wisely takes pauses from the tense moments to let those three characters rule the movie for awhile. One of the movie's best scenes comes when McClane tearfully admits to Powell that he regrets never saying the words ""I'm sorry"" to his wife. Michael Kamen effectively tones down his memorable and often grandiose musical score to fit these scenes.<br/><br/>With all of the high praise given so far, and ""Die Hard"" deserves every word of it, there is one huge problem. It is called Idiot Plot Syndrome. Roger Ebert is known for using it, although he did not coin the term. When a plot has easily solved problems but they take way too long to solve because most of the characters are idiots, the movie is infected with Idiot Plot Syndrome.<br/><br/>""Die Hard"" puts on an idiots' convention. Let's consider Idiot Number One. McClane plans to lure the police to Nakatomi Plaza any way he can. With the phone lines cut, he uses a radio to report the hostage takeover. The brilliant 911 dispatcher completely ignores the report of terrorists with military weapons because she prefers to argue that the channel is reserved for emergency calls. Even machine gun fire loud enough to hurt her ears is not enough to punch reality through her lead skull into her stubborn brain.<br/><br/>The police eventually arrive, and with them Deputy Chief Dwayne T. Robinson (Paul Gleason). Robinson readily accepts every possible explanation except the real one. His stupidity is not too bad at first, and actually plays a critical role in advancing the plot. It becomes annoying when he sees what is really happening and fails to wise up. He even hates McClane after he saves the lives of multiple officers because he does not like how he did it. Even worse are Johnson and Johnson from the FBI. If FBI agents honestly think losing 25% of a group of hostages is acceptable, I want to change countries. Then there is the coke snorting brownnoser who works with Holly, turkey television reporter (William Atherton), and the hack doctor who describes ""Helsinki Syndrome"" on the evening news. I could go on.<br/><br/>When I saw ""Die Hard"" the first time, I had no idea if the movie was supposed to be a rousing action thriller, and action comedy, or a parody. The action is too hard hitting to be absurd, but the supporting characters are too goofy to be taken seriously. As a result, I did not enjoy the movie as an action or a comedy. I was confused and annoyed. I ended up frustrated with a movie I should have loved. Without Idiot Plot Syndrome and the misplaced humor it brings, ""Die Hard"" would certainly rate an eight of ten, and probably a nine. As it stands, six out of ten is all I can fairly award it."

","Die Hard (1988) was an good and entertaining film that made a star out of Bruce Willis and gave Alan Rickman's career a shot in the arm as a screen villain.

He makes a creepy and entertaining villain who acts circles around the cast. <br/><br/>A visiting New York cop (Bruce Willis) is inside a high rise building trying to see his ex-wife (Bonnie Bedelia Mc Culken). His timing is bad because he walks right into an armed heist. The leader of the thugs (Alan Rickman) claims to be an international terrorist who wont stop at nothing to free his brother in arms. What is a cop on holiday going to do? Can he rescue the innocent people and save his wife? How will this affect his Christmas plans? Is the leader of this armed gang really what he claims to be? you'll have to find out when you watch DIE HARD.<br/><br/>Like I said, it's not the classic people make it out to be.

But now I look at it and just see another product on Reagan-era patriotic exploitation. Just like every ""Ahnuld"" film, ""Sly"" film, etc. The only real difference here is that some of the acting is very good, and the antagonist (can't believe his name alludes me at the moment) is brilliantly fiendish. Bruce Willis, on the other hand, is just another tough guy bonehead, only he doesn't have the physical condition to be one.

","One of the original action flicks from the '80s, John McTiernan's ""Die Hard"" makes no pretense about being a kick-ass movie. Bruce Willis plays a New York cop John McClane, coming to LA to meet his estranged wife (Bonnie Bedelia). Sure enough, the building in which she works get hijacked by a group of German terrorists. Terrorist leader Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman in his debut), while totally evil, is also quite cultured. Even though the cards look stacked against John McClane, he's ready to take on every one of these terrorists.<br/><br/>Twenty years after its release, this movie will probably only appeal to Willis's fans. While mostly a litany of machismo, there are some cringe-inducing scenes (namely when John has to walk across glass). But the movie's main focus is to show Bruce Willis being a tough guy. They do everything possible to make him a superhuman individual to whom we can still relate.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a flick that you'll want to avoid if you're into intellectualism. But you'll love it if you're a testosterone-driven dude. I think that I'm content having seen it only once. Also starring Alexander Godunov (one of the Amish farmers in ""Witness""), Paul Gleason (the principal in ""The Breakfast Club"") and William Atherton (the EPA agent in ""Ghostbusters"").<br/><br/>I wouldn't mind getting to ride off into the sunset with Grace Kelly."

I mean come on! Perhaps it's because it was the first of its kind; a gun-ho action movie where a singular protagonists lays the smack down on many a bad guy. I don't really have much to say about the film itself, other than nice explosions and nice guns. Whether or not it continued the tradition of the standard action flick, which is debatable, that's all I can really say about this movie: standard.<br/><br/>Standard characters, standard storyline, and standard comic-relief.

I was also rather disappointed in a particular racial slur uttered at one point during this movie. Mr. Willis, I expected better of you.<br/><br/>However, before you heed my advice and run as far away from this movie as is humanly possible, something has to be said for the real stars of the film: Alan Rickman and his wondrous band of terrorists. The performance of Rickman himself is complete with flawless American/German accents, dry humor that kept me laughing at something other than the outlandishness of the rest of the film, and genuinely good acting. Alexander Goudonov's Karl was so beautifully executed I'd be less likely to cry during his ballet interpretation of Swan Lake. Clarence Gilyard Jr's character was so amazingly undaunted by the violence throughout the entire movie that if I saw him in the street I would applaud him while repeatedly shouting 'Bravo!'.

I did give it eight out of ten only because someone very wise once told me that nothing is ever perfect, at least not to the writer. That being said I suppose I should get on with my review.<br/><br/>This movie to me was a great work of art. Full of twists and turns and yet some small bit of predictability. So much so that this film has been copied several times over. Most recently by White House Down.<br/><br/>One of my favorite scenes in this one is the part when McClane, sends a seasons greeting down in the elevator. I would like to think that in the end McClane and his wife make it work after all this is said and done, but we all know that is not going to happen.<br/><br/>I find that this movie inspires me in so many ways with my own writing and I look back at it when I feel stuck.<br/><br/>Now I know this is not much of a review for those wanting to know more, but this is what I have and what I am willing to share. You will just have to watch it and see what I mean."

","Totally outrageous, totally unbelievable and totally over the top - and as Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) would say - 'But who cares'? It's Bruce Willis in a version of saving humanity along the lines of John Wayne, Rambo and Marshal Dillon. Personally, John McClane had me when he said he was partial to Roy Rogers because that's who my favorite TV and movie cowboy was as a kid growing up. I'd bet that someone might say that of Willis some day.<br/><br/>In his own way, John McClane must have had some sort of mystical power because up until the point he started crawling through the transom feeling like a TV dinner, his wife-beater t-shirt was white with some blood spatter. But when he hit the floor again to do battle with the bad guys it suddenly turned brown. So mesmerized was I by this turn of events that I never even noticed when the shirt turned a neat dark forest green later in the picture. I wonder how stuff like that gets by the director? <br/><br/>Say, and how about the FBI sending in a double Johnson to take over the attack at Nakatomi Plaza? I'm sure there's a pretty good punch line in there somewhere but I think I'll just let it go for now.<br/><br/>It's been stated, and rightly so I think, that this film set a new standard for action/adventure flicks with Bruce Willis portraying a new kind of hero. He's smart, thinks on his feet, takes what help he can get, and engages in wise-ass banter to keep the audience fully engaged. All the noise, explosions and crashing glass is merely window dressing to keep the story moving as our hero saves the day. What more can you ask for in a two hour action flick? <br/><br/>You know, if this was a Roy Rogers Western it would probably have a title like ""Under California Stars"". If I had to guess, I'd say Bruce Willis saw that one when he was a kid."
"Dr_Coulardeau","8","1","2","19 February 2015"," Funny revisit to action films before digitalization
","Do not expect a film that is going to revolutionize your ideology, your spirituality, your religion, or even your political beliefs. It is an action film that is supposed to entertain you and nothing else, and yet<br/><br/>It starts with some nice Christmas party in some high rise office block in some international super capitalistic business if not corporation. The poor John McLane is coming to Los Angeles from New York to visit his children and wife he has been estranged from for some months with three thousand miles between their two places of residence.<br/><br/>The whole tower block is taken over by some German terrorists just after John McLane has arrived and the whole film will be his action in order to get rid of the terrorists, to save the hostages and to save his own wife. <br/><br/>The film shows how rotten some apples in the basket can be. Even one is able to sell his own colleagues to get a coke in a glass, hardly more. In fact he won't even be able to drink it because once he has given some leverage to the terrorists they just thank him for the rest of his eternal life.<br/><br/>But what's best in this film is the action and the visual effects. No digitalized special effects and it looks real, rough, hard. The very good final product is reached thanks to the editing of the film. It makes it so fast that it becomes breath-taking and at times it is hilarious because some of the situations look so hectic, so extreme, and yet they are nothing but an illusion and it is enjoyable.<br/><br/>It is also enjoyable to see LAPD officers, inspectors or whatever they may call them down there being smashed up, the FBI being fooled and ridiculed, the media being unworthy of any trust, and only two little black men coming on top, a plain motorized street cop who manages to raise the alarm and a little black limousine chauffeur who manages to block the escape of the last terrorists. That makes you feel happy and warm in the heart. The little ones are the heroes of the film.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"

","Like Christmas like action movies, you sure do. This is the best one of those ever, plus it also acts as a cultural tour-de-force of the American psyche. What seems like a simple premise of man vs international terrorists actually has much deeper layers great character acting from all the cast, brilliant dialogue both a guiding light to all action movies that followed and a homage to all those before, this was the film that made the hero a real guy, when before action hero's where always too invincible to be believable. I don't want to say much more than if you haven't watched this movie, then clear 2 hours from your day and sit down with a big bag of chips a big drink of cola, sit back relax and watch this movie, it just doesn't miss a beat every action scene is racing, the tension holds perfectly through out.

","""Die Hard"" is about a New York cop, John McClane who has come to Los Angeles, California to celebrate Christmas with his family on Christmas Eve. His wife Holly McClane, who formally is now Holly Gennaro is now working at the Nakatomi Plaza building as everyone is enjoying the Christmas party when a group of terrorist led by Hans Gruber is taking over the building as the people are being hostage, and as Gruber is trying to robbed the building's money. So, it us up to McClane to kick some major butt at Gruber and his men to save his wife, and the rest of the hostages. ""Die Hard"" is without a doubt one of the greatest action films ever made as well as being a Christmas classic; it really does kick a whole lot of butt as I am watching it. Bruce Willis is and shall always be remembered as John McClane; he gave such an awesome performance and there is no one to play the role because Willis is so darn perfect. Of course, he did deliver the famous ""Yippee Ki Yay"" line and it is indeed memorable because everyone always remember that line. Alan Rickman plays such a memorable villain, and he is a whole lot of fun to watch. The rest of the cast are great in their own roles. Michael Kamen does a fantastic job with the music, and it does give so much excitement as there is action going on; also, I thought the action is really darn good and it really is exciting. The movie does go by at a very good pace, and it never tries to slow things down. John McTiernan, who just got off from directing another great movie by Twentieth Century Fox ""Predator"" does deliver a great movie, and does handle it well when it all comes to action movies. There have been many movies that tried to ripoff the same formula as what this movie did will never be as good, or the same as what made ""Die Hard"" so awesome. I love this movie so much, and I give it a 10 out of 10."

","Proclaimed as one of the worlds best action movies, and self- proclaimed as a Christmas movie Die Hard burns right into your memory with great characters and great action.<br/><br/>Yesterday I re-watched this film with a couple of friends. I must say this is indeed a great action film. Not only is the story simple and in my eyes believable, but the dialog and the characters interact brilliantly. <br/><br/>The reason why this is one of the best action movies of all time must be the level of detail. Not much is left unanswered; He did in fact try to get some shoes, but they were too small, so he kept running around bare foot! The action is great and not always over the top, but when it has to like the two major explosions it is satisfying and makes your little child go laughing of excitement. The humor is blended well in, and never feels awkward or misplaced, it basically just adds as another layer on the cake of awesomeness.<br/><br/>The actors are great. Bruce is of course funny and believable as an everyday man who is not Arnold big, but not small either. Alan Rickman is a great actor, who works so well as a bad guy. The rest is in my eyes average, but no one sticks out as horrible or wrong cast. <br/><br/>This will forever be a classic for it genre and will always be a great Christmas movie with no snow or Santa, but with some bad ass explosions."

","I love this movie so much. It's so good. It's so entertaining. I just love it so much. I love seeing all of the technology from the late 1980s, and seeing fashion from that time. <br/><br/>In this movie, John McClane is a simple man. He is an officer of the NYPD and he's visiting his possibly-soon-to-be wife, Holly. He goes to see her at her office, where they're having the annual Christmas party. Whilst there, the building is taken over by German terrorist, Hans Gruber, and everyone is taken hostage. The thing they don't know is, that John McClane is there. And he loves kicking ass, and does it very well. He spends the night, destroying their plans, killing the terrorists, until he eventually kills Hans and saves the day.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis' performance is great in this film. He does amazingly at action movies, and I love his signature line that he says several times throughout the movie: yippee-ki-yay, motherf**ker. It's hilarious.<br/><br/>This is my favorite movie from the Die Hard series.<br/><br/>Overall, I give this movie a 10 out of 10. Absolutely fabulous."

","The idea is a great one for an action movie: A cop is trapped inside a skyscraper with a team of desperate terrorists. He is all that stands between them and their hostages. Give the terrorist leader brains and a personality, make one of the hostages the estranged wife of the cop and you've got a movie.<br/><br/>Starring Bruce Willis, it's about a New York cop who has flown out to Los Angeles for Christmas, and we quickly learn that his marriage was put on hold after his wife (Bonnie Bedelia) left for the Coast to accept a great job offer. She is now a vice president of the multinational Nakatomi Corp., and shortly after Willis makes his surprise entrance at her office party, the terrorists strike.<br/><br/>They, too, are a multinational group, led by a German named Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) who is well-dressed and has a neatly trimmed beard and talks like an intellectual and thinks he is superior to the riffraff he has to associate with. He has a plan that has been devised with clockwork precision involving the theft of millions of dollars in negotiable bonds, and it is only after Willis starts causing trouble that he is forced to take the Nakatomi employees as hostages.<br/><br/>The terrorists are skilled and well-armed, and there are a lot of them. Willis' strategy involves keeping them off guard with lightning attacks from his hiding place on an upper floor of the building that is still under construction. This plan involves the deployment of a great many stunts and special effects, such as when Willis swings through a plate glass window on the end of a fire rope or when he drops plastics explosives down the elevator shaft.<br/><br/>Willis remains in constant radio contact with a police officer on the ground (Reginald Veljohnson) who tries to keep his morale up. This is where the movie gives us human interaction to who John McClane really is: he is a screw up, and he is afraid to do this mission; however, he's a cop, and he's doing what he was trained to do. This makes him different from other action stars like Schwarzenegger or Stallone because he is human. Those scenes with his bloody feet cut from glass is painful to watch. <br/><br/>It's a great action movie that has enough stunts and action to keep you invested, and enough interaction between the main characters to make the movie have humanistic elements to it. It's considered one of the best action movies ever, and for a reason."

This is when 12 terrorists, led by Hans Gruber, take over the Nakatomi building and John is forced to escape to elsewhere in the building.<br/><br/>The film is constant action, filmed incredibly with John constantly having to outwit and out gun his opponents, with the aid of the LAPD which actually, in truth, get completely annihilated by the terrorists. There are many catchy quotes, such as ""yippee-ki-yay motherf*cker"", and many comedic lines which is exactly what a great film needs! <br/><br/>The way the terrorists conduct themselves is incredibly intellectual, leaving multiple false trails for police to follow in order to hide their true intentions, which will not be revealed here!<br/><br/>Bruce Willis portrays John McClane incredibly, and I have seen this film about 20 times and will never say no to watching it again. 10/10!"

","DIE HARD<br/><br/>Hell yeah!<br/><br/>This film is about a cop from New York, named John, that is spending Christmas with his estranged wife and kids. While he is waiting for his wife in her office at her work place, a group of terrorists come in and holds everyone hostage. The hostages make a few demands, but while the police and FBI are outside trying to negotiate their way in, the terrorists are trying to break into a vault that holds a lot of money. John is on his own in there, picking them all off one by one while he tries to save his wife and the rest of the hostages.<br/><br/>This is a blast from the past for me. I watched this a lot when I was a kid. The action is awesome this really is one of Bruce Willis' best movies.<br/><br/>The film is full of funny catchphrases that is quoted every day. I love the language they use in this film. Hans Gruber is the bad guy, he is from Germany and his accent is brilliant. I love the attitude that John has all the way through this film. He makes me laugh at times, but also angry. It is a good combination. His sarcasm at times really makes the film better.<br/><br/>The relationship he has with Sgt. Powell is brilliant. I love the fact that the contact he has with the outside world was with one cop. They form a nice bond and a friendship even though they have never met. It is a nice moment when they do finally meet at the end of the movie.<br/><br/>The action scenes were epic back then too. The film was made in 1988, and the explosions and gun fights were great. The other thing I liked about this film was the fact there were explosions, gun fights and even fist fights. During the fist fights, the good guy got his butt kicked too it was good at the time because he was losing so badly that you really didn't know if he could beat them all.<br/><br/>The effects were questionable in places. Some of the explosions didn't look too real, but then others looked brilliant.<br/><br/>The casting was fantastic. Bruce Willis in his most famous role. He will always be remembered for being John McClane. He was great. Bonnie Bedelia as his wife Holly was also really well chosen. She had great 80s hair back then, but it suited her and the time. She is a great actress, especially in this movie. Reginald VelJohnson played his friend Sgt Powell. I recognize Reginald from a few films. He always has a very friendly smile and seems like a guy you would like straight away. He is a good actor. Alan Rickman played the leader of the terrorists, Hans Gruber. This was the perfect role for Alan. He is really good at playing slimy, scary characters. Other cast members were William Atherton (another actor who is great at playing slimeballs), Robert Davi and Grand L. Bush.<br/><br/>This is such a classic movie and should be seen by everyone. There have been 4 sequels to this movie so far and there are some great films amongst them, but they will never top the original although I do love part 3 as much as this one.<br/><br/>I will give this film 8 out of 10.<br/><br/>""Welcome to the party pal!""<br/><br/>For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:<br/><br/>https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204"

","John McTiernan directed this big action hit starring Bruce Willis as New York police officer John McClane, who is visiting his wife Holly(played by Bonnie Bedelia) at her job in Los Angeles in a big high rise office building. While changing his clothes, John is stunned to learn that terrorists led by Hans Gruber(played by Alan Rickman) have taken over, and are threatening to kill the hostages unless their demands are met, though it turns out their motives are mercenary rather than political. John must find a way to defeat these crooks, even if he is alone... Highly exciting and intelligent thriller with a star-making performance by Willis as wise-cracking but tough McClane, and Rickman also quite good as steely villain. First of a series of films."
"jimbo-53-186511","8","1","2","10 September 2013"," Gripping, tense and terrific action film starring Bruce Willis in his most iconic role
","I must admit that although Die Hard isn't my 'favourite' action film as such, it is still an excellent action film and is right up there with the best films of its genre.<br/><br/>We begin with officer John McClane (Willis) who is on a flight from New York to Los Angeles to spend Christmas with his family. His ex wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) is at a Christmas party at the Nakatomi Plaza and John has arranged to meet her there. Whilst there, the complex is breached by a group of terrorists led by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman). Hans is intent on stealing a $600 million dollar fortune which is kept in a safe at the Plaza. When the owner of the Nakatomi Plaza Joseph Yoshinobu (James Shigeta)refuses to provide Hans with the code for the safe, Hans kills him and due to the fact that no-one else knows the code he sets about trying a different method to get his hands on the cash. In the meantime, he also holds all the patrons hostage - all except one person who managed to evade capture namely 'John McClane' and he is determined to stop Hans and his goons by any means possible.<br/><br/>A lot of the strengths in Die Hard come from the way the tension is created. Although all of this takes place in a 40 storey building, strangely enough at times there is almost a feeling of 'claustrophobia'. You see a lot of McClane in tight spaces and on a number of occasions he gets very close to his captors and I think it really helps to create an edge of your seat feel to the whole proceedings. Hans Gruber is also an excellent villain - the very fact that he is so calm, cool and calculated makes him more dangerous and ultimately more terrifying. It seems that no matter what is thrown at him, he never panics and almost views holding hostages as being like a game of chess - he always appears to be one or 2 moves ahead of everyone else.<br/><br/>Kudos also should go to John McTiernan for his exceptional direction of Die Hard. He really has given it a 'claustrophobic' feel - much like he did with Predator. I also felt the score was excellent - although it wasn't as good as the score in Predator it still more than complemented the overall tone of the film. As with Predator, there are also plenty of humorous moments and one liners (who can forget the classic 'Yippee Ki Yay' line from McClane).<br/><br/>The acting was also great by everyone involved (particularly by Alan Rickman). His portrayal of Hans Gruber was pretty much perfect and he will be long remembered as being one of the better villains to grace our screens. Even though Die Hard is now 25 years old, it still has a certain 'freshness' about it and it is a film that I thoroughly enjoyed."
"BA_Harrison","10","1","2","8 August 2013"," Still the best of the series.
","The first time I ever saw Die Hard it was at the Film On The Square screening, part of the London Film Festival in Leicester Square, November 1988; I spent the following weeks—up until the film's official UK release date on February 3rd—trying to convince people that Bruce Willis would be the next big Hollywood action star and that Die Hard would change the face of the action genre forever. 'Bruce Willis from Moonlighting?' they would say, 'I don't think so.' 'Just wait and see', I would reply...<br/><br/>A quarter of a century later and Bruce is still proving me right (the fifth Die Hard movie came out earlier this year and Red 2 is on general release as I type); but no matter how long the guy keeps on blowing stuff up and shooting bad guys on screen, I doubt he will ever match the brilliance of Die Hard, which remains the pinnacle of action cinema as far as I am concerned, a film where everything came together to create pure cinematic gold.<br/><br/>Director John McTiernan at the top of his game, fresh from the success of Schwarzenegger vehicle Predator; perfect casting throughout, from Alan Rickman's loathsome lead villain Hans Gruber and Bonnie Bedelia's plucky Holly McClean, right down to Al Leong as mustachioed henchman Uli and Playboy Playmate Terri Lynn Doss as the blonde hottie at the airport; a great soundtrack that combines hip-hop and classical music with a seasonal flavour; visual effects from Richard Edlund that still hold up well against any of today's CGI; superb cinematography courtesy of Jan De Bont; a brilliant script with cracking dialogue and a wry sense of humour (that scene with the SWAT member catching himself on a rose bush still cracks me up!): Die Hard is virtually flawless in every department.<br/><br/>Unless you've been in a coma or living in a cave for the past two and a half decades, you'll no doubt be familiar with the plot, so I won't waste any time summarising what happens, suffice to say that the set-up is lean, mean and full of explosive, edge-of-the-seat action, and is still influencing action film-makers today, recent examples being comic-book sci-fi flick Dredd and martial arts actioner The Raid. But no matter how many derivatives (or sequels) it spawns, the original will always be the best—a white knuckle ride of a movie with the power to thrill your socks off even after all of these years (so watch out for broken glass!)."

Actually, this film is very epic and monumental. It was directed by John McTiernan in 1988. Bruce Willis and Alan Rickman were starring in the film. <br/><br/>The story began on Christmas Eve. Lovely Time, isn't it? Hm Not with terrorists. John McClane, the cop from New York City arrived in Los Angeles to reconcile with his estranged wife, Holly. She worked in a huge skyscraper. Its name was Nakatomi Plaza. In the building, there was a Christmas party. John didn't want to celebrate, so he went to his wife's office. There he relaxed. All the while, terrorists came to the tower. They took hostages. Just McClane remained free. He was alone. John had to do something. Holly and all the personnel were in trouble. The leader of the terrorists was Hans Gruber from Germany. He wanted the money from the safe. So he killed the director, Nakatomi. John was very pointful, sly and composed. He caught the terrorists, one by one. The police came out in the end. They helped McClane and saved the hostages.<br/><br/>So the story was very simple but good. In Turn, the implementation and acting were amazing. The movie was successful in Hollywood and later in the world. So Bruce Willis made three other films in the next couple of years. They are awesome, too. Now, in 2013 was the premiere of the fifth film. The movie was made in our capital city, Budapest. It title's A Good Day to Die Hard.

","Extremely thrilling and you will have your heart in your mouth most of the time, this 1988 classic action movie introduced a multi-million dollar franchise starring Bruce Willis as the lead, which as of today has spanned over 25 years with the latest addition to the movie franchise released in 2013 and titled A Good Day to Die Hard. This movie is wonderfully casted, superior in its story telling than most action movies in its time, and the villain Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman who played Sheriff Of Nottingham in Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves in 1991 with Kevin Costner and Severus Snape in the Harry Potter Film series) was so out of it that it was amazing how he lost the fight.<br/><br/>No better lone hero action movie has been able to stand the test of time like Die Hard has. This 1988 first in the film series was nominated for four Academy Awards including Best Sound Editing, Best Film Editing, Best Sound Mixing and Best Visual Effects. Bruce Willis character portrayal in this movie has been highly praised by many and he has carved a name for himself. As a young boy watching this franchise, me and my friends memorized John McClane's (Bruce Willis) catchphrase to use whenever, the phrase ""Yippee kai yay, motherfu@#er"" was nominated as one of the best movie lines in the AFI's 100 Greatest Movie Lines.<br/><br/>The movie plot and script is an adaptation based on 1979 Roderick Thorp bestselling novel Nothing Lasts Forever, about a New York City Police officer John McClane, who got in the middle of L.A. skyscraper heist, as he traveled to L.A. to go visit his family.<br/><br/>The heist is led by Hans Gruber who under the guise of a terrorist attack took over the skyscraper so as to steal 640 million dollars in bonds. What Hans didn't plan was running into McClane who was in the same building and this man was ready to do anything possible including risking his life to stop Hans and his group. The sad part of this movie is the Deputy Chief of Police his portrayal in this movie is annoying and you have to over look him, which is easy since he had a few screen times.<br/><br/>This movie was a commercial success making over 140 million based on a 28 million dollar budget and the screenplay is written by Steven E. de Souza (Commando (1985) and Die Harder (Die Hard 2 (1990)) and Jeb Stuart.<br/><br/>To me this one of my very best Bruce Willis movie after Sixth Sense of cause, and I'm sure majority has already seen this, so I say go see it again.<br/><br/>Also in this franchise are Die Hard 2 (1990), Die Hard with a Vengeance (1995), Live Free or Die Hard (2007) and A Good Day to Die Hard (2013)."

You love everyone of his taunts, his language, the way he pushes himself to beat the odds, and his view on what's right.<br/><br/>There are only no real negative things I could find, only small stuff. One is that there are a few 80s elements clearly visible in the film that haven't aged well, like the way the coke snorter is played and some of the female hair styles are done. Two, from time to time, Alan Rickman pushes his acting a bit far on the caricature end.<br/><br/>Beyond that, even with age, it's a great action flick."

"KineticSeoul","8","1","2","18 February 2013"," One of the best action movies
","This is one of the best action movies ever made and it still holds up today. And influenced other action movies that came after it. This one really gives more of the everyday guy, someone you can relate with that gets put in a dire situation and must become of a badass. And he is a sarcastic guy that ticks off the bad guys and has punchlines but he is still a likable badass. He even gets bloodied up and bruised up during the process. Unlike those Steven Seagal movies where he hardly had a scratch after taking on dozens or even tons of bad guys. The build up is good and when the action kicks in, it's entertaining from start to finish. In fact this is probably the movie that really kick started Bruce Willis's career in the film industry as John McClane. The whole movie, well most of the action at least takes place within a tall building. And it's cool to see John McClane using every resource he has to fight the villains that takes over the building and holds onto hostages. And it's entertaining to see how everything plays out. Even the main villain Hans Gruber who is the leader of the pack played by Alan Rickman. He is this sophisticated and yet very methodical villain that keeps his cool no matter how bad the situation gets for his team. Overall this is a kickass action movie that has just about all the right elements to be engaging and entertaining movie.<br/><br/>8.8/10"

Everyone else is a bad guy or being idiots, and this makes the movie so great, and you really feel for John. <br/><br/>The villain Hans Gruber is also an iconic villain, with his German accent, and creepy attitude. The relationship between John and Hans is very well, and is a key factor, cause they almost never meet, they only talk threw a Walkie Talkie, and it is really hard to do. Well done to the director for that. All in all a great movie, an 8 out of 10 for me!"

","Die Hard is an action film directed by John McTiernan and written by Steve de Souza and Jeb Stuart based on the 1979 novel Nothing Lasts Forever by Roderick Thorp.The film follows NYPD officer John McClane,played by Bruce Willis, as he takes on a group of highly organized criminals led by Hans Gruber performing a heist under the guise of a terrorist attack, using hostages including McClane's wife Holly to keep the police at bay.<br/><br/>It's Christmas time in L.A., and there's an employee party in progress on the 30th floor of the Nakatomi Corporation building. The revelry comes to a violent end when the party goers are taken hostage by a group of terrorists headed by Hans Gruber, who plan to steal the 600 million dollars locked in Nakatomi's high-tech safe. In truth, Gruber and his henchmen are only pretending to be politically motivated to throw the authorities off track; also in truth, Gruber has no intention of allowing anyone to get out of the building alive. Meanwhile, New York cop John McClane has come to L.A. to visit his estranged wife, Holly, who happens to be one of the hostages. Disregarding the orders of the authorities surrounding the building, McClane, who fears nothing (except heights), takes on the villains, armed with one handgun and plenty of chutzpah. <br/><br/>The scenes move with such relentless energy and smashing special-effects extravagance that Die Hard turns out to be everything action-genre fans, and Bruce Willis's relieved investors, might have hoped for.Apart from that,it is characterized as great pace, great gun battles, great fun.For this reason alone,Die Hard delivers."

"Scarecrow-88","9","1","2","25 December 2011"," Die Hard
","Die Hard is what it is: terrorists looking to secure $400 million, hidden in a vault in various ways (stocks, treasures from empires, paintings, etc), hold a partying white collar group of a corporation, celebrating in a long, tall, posh, under-construction, swank high rise in Los Angeles, hostage (including the wife of the heroic cop, John McClaine, from New York City) while a visiting cop, hidden in a bathroom (with no socks/shoes), escapes, becoming a real thorn up their ass, taking them out one by one as their leader (played by the coolly confident, reserved Alan Rickman, who never rattles even as it appears he's in deep trouble when law enforcement (including the FBI) surround the building). That's it. The plot is just enough to allow Bruce Willis to shoot a bunch of people while stacking the odds considerably against him.<br/><br/>You get explosions gutting the high rise, windows shattering into debris from gunfire, legs and bodies torn apart by bullets, and machine guns causing plenty of casualties and damage to walls. Willis makes nifty use of C-4 and uses the strap of a machine gun and a fire hose to get out of sticky situations. There's even a brutal scene as a worried Willis pulls glass from the bottom of his feet while telling police officer Al (played by Reginald VelJohnson of Family Matters fame) a message to give to his wife just in case he doesn't make it. This movie has the clichés, including the ridiculous return of a heavy who miraculously recovers from being lynched by heavy chained coiled three times around his throat only to be taken down by a cop who says he will never draw his gun from his holster after an unfortunate shooting of a thirteen year old hood. <br/><br/>If you enjoy movies where a heroic cop constantly evades certain death by eluding his adversaries through cunning and brilliant canny to think on his feet (although even he can be somewhat fooled as Rickman is able, for a moment, to trick Willis into thinking he's a hostage; not to mention, he walks into a gun pointing at his face (it's to Willis good fortune that he has made the thug so mad he wants to fight with fists instead of popping a couple rounds in his face), then Die Hard is the gold standard of such movies.<br/><br/>Sure, the movie's implausibilities are many, but I embrace these things in an action movie from the 80shell, it is to be expected. A good villain helps and this one's (Rickman) is a doozy. Willis has some great quips and one-liners, putting him in great company along with Arnold and Sly because he able to slide comfortably into such a tough-guy archetype seemingly easily—I found him wholly convincing and exciting to watch. <br/><br/>Bonnie Bedelia is expertly cast as an equally tough wife who has become so disenchanted with her husband that she has taken her maiden name back (I got a kick out of Willis' annoyance as he notices her maiden name throughout the building) because Willis wasn't so keen on moving away from The Big Apple to The City of Angels. She, like Willis, is able to buy herself some time, keep her calm when trouble looms, and faces danger without breaking a sweat. <br/><br/>Some fun casting for actions fans includes Paul Gleason as a surly asshole (what else but this time of character should one expect from Gleason, he's so reliable as someone who gets under your skin with his attitude) Chief of Police, Hart Bochner as a coke-snorting creep business salesman, and William Atherton as (what else?) a troublesome, success-seeking, self-absorbed news reporter who goes out of his way to get information on Willis, placing him and Bedelia in danger of being discovered. Even though they don't meet until the end, the film hinges on the great chemistry between Willis and VelJohnson who communicate back and forth via walkie talkies during the whole movie. What is rather fascinating about this is the fact that Rickman can listen to their every word. How McClain gets Al's attention with the use of a terrorist's body is a cool action scene fans like me eat up with great joy."
"FilmFreak94","10","1","2","22 December 2011"," An Awesome Action Movie That Still Holds Up Today
","Die Hard is the story of a regular police officer named John McClane(Bruce Willis) who travels to Los Angelas on Christmas Eve to try and make up with his wife, Holly. She's attending a party held by a wealthy businessman at his huge tower building. When he arrives McClane is thrown into a not so regular situation when a group of terrorists, led by the mysterious Hans Gruber(Alan Rickman), take over the building and keep all the guests hostage. McClane is able to avoid capture but must now find a way to get the polices' attention, save the hostages, including his wife, and stay alive.<br/><br/>The plot sounds simple enough, because it is, but the action in Die Hard is some of the best I've ever seen in a movie. McClane isn't a superhero and he does take a lot of damage throughout the movie and goes through many close calls. That's what makes you drawn to his character and makes you want to see him get out alive. As the movie goes on he's able to take out each of the terrorists and is able to get up and down the building in very creative ways. He befriends a LA police officer halfway through the movie(played by Reginald VelJohnson) and their conversations delve more into their characters and make them more human. We also learn more about Hans and his motives to capturing the building.<br/><br/>All these elements combined with edge of your seat action scenes make Die Hard a must watch for any fans of the action movie genre. Bruce Willis is able to play a convincing every day man who just so happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time and Alan Rickman is always a great antagonist. I highly recommend it."
"Siamois","10","1","2","20 December 2011"," A masterpiece in the action genre
","In Los Angeles, a well-organized group of criminals crash a corporate Christmas party taking place in a high rise building and take everyone hostage, except for one down-on-his luck New-York cop. A bloody cat and mouse game between NYPD officer John McClane and the so-called terrorists ensues.<br/><br/>It's been over two decades since Die Hard was released and having just watched it again, I am amazed at how well it has stood the test of time as a fun action flick. Die Hard created new standards in the action genre that have rarely been achieved this well since then. It all starts with the protagonist John McClane. The character being portrayed as a flawed cop with his own set of problems makes it easy for the audience to relate to his struggles. Director John McTiernan wisely decided to cast Bruce Willis, who was up to that point mostly considered a comedy actor on TV, rather than a big established action star. Willis grabbed this opportunity and turned John McClane into an iconic character in the genre thanks to mixing humor and toughness while still showing the character as fallible. The audience suffers with McClane as the character accumulate bruises and bumps and has to deal not only with the criminals but also with the incompetent authorities.<br/><br/>Another element that explains the movie's success is the vast number of secondary characters who are surprisingly well fleshed out considering the very limited screen time most of them get. Of course, Alan Rickman as the evil mastermind Hans Gruber is perfect. But it is really in the small details given to other characters that we find many great lines.<br/><br/>Die Hard's biggest achievement is probably in how it successfully mixes gritty action while injecting humor at just the right moments. After establishing the scenery in the first 15 minutes, Die Hard begins to gain more and more momentum, seemingly never letting the foot off the gas pedal. But despite that, McTiernan never takes the movie too seriously and we get several memorable lines and humorous moments.<br/><br/>Setting the whole movie inside of a building creates a great sense of claustrophobia for the viewers. The action scenes are brilliant, we wonder how McClane will prevail against a bunch criminals armed with automatic weapons and worse. We share McClane's frustration when the police proves to be clueless, we laugh at the jokes. Technically, the movie is well shot, with few frills and the special effects take a backseat to good old action scenes.<br/><br/>All in all, Die Hard is a brilliant genre movie which will appeal to all action fans but is brilliant enough to entertain viewers who do not usually enjoy this type of film.<br/><br/>A classic."
"Hey_Sweden","10","1","2","3 December 2011"," The way an action movie should be done.
","Loosely based on the novel ""Nothing Lasts Forever"" by Roderick Thorp, and scripted by Jeb Stuart and Steven E. de Souza, ""Die Hard"" is very much one of THE quintessential action movies of the modern era, delivering many thrills and laughs for over two hours.<br/><br/>It gave TV star Bruce Willis one of the defining film roles of his career, as a frustrated, foul mouthed, yet very human and talkative average Joe detective forced into becoming the hero, when a slick group of nasty terrorists infiltrate a high rise office building and cause havoc. John McClane (Willis) has to rely on his own wits and resilience to save the day when the odds seem to be outrageously stacked against him. To add to that, most of the authority figures on the outside turn out to be useless, to put it charitably.<br/><br/>Willis is engaging in the lead, and convincing in action and fight sequences as well. One of the most appreciable and interesting facets to the movie is indeed the ""cat and mouse"" game he plays with the terrorist leader, a man named Hans Gruber. The always excellent Alan Rickman, at the time a very well respected Shakespearan actor, makes a hell of a film debut as Hans. Hans is an intriguing character because on one hand he's a well dressed, confident, intelligent, and cultured man, yet at the same time, he's a cold blooded creep. The other well developed relationship in the story is between John and L.A.P.D. sergeant Al Powell (future TV star Reginald VelJohnson, in his break through film role), the only person on the outside with more than half a brain in his head and who repeatedly offers John the words of encouragement that he needs.<br/><br/>Lovely Bonnie Bedelia may play the only substantial female role in the movie, as Johns' estranged wife, Holly, but she's a tough cookie who does have the courage to stand up to Hans as he and his men throw their weight around. Alexander Godunov, who'd previously appeared in ""Witness"", is great fun as the thuggish, vengeance crazed goon Karl, who proves so indestructible near the end he comes off as a horror movie type of villain. Paul Gleason portrays inept, thoughtless deputy police chief Dwayne Robinson, a humourless jerk who served as a prototype for similar roles in future action movies. Other unlikable weasels are memorably portrayed by William Atherton (the stubborn, very self serving reporter) and Hart Bochner (the coke snorting corporate sleaze who foolishly thinks he can reason with Hans). Even the FBI agents on this case (Robert Davi, Grand L. Bush) come off as pretty dumb and don't express too much concern for the hostages. A number of other familiar faces in small roles, too: James Shigeta as corporation boss Takagi, De'voreaux White as the likable limo driver Argyle, Clarence Gilyard Jr. ('Walker: Texas Ranger') as the electronics expert Theo, Al Leong as candy bar thief / terrorist Uli, comedian Rick Ducommun as the city worker, and Mary Ellen Trainor (recognizable to action fans as the psychiatrist in the ""Lethal Weapon"" series) as the lady newscaster.<br/><br/>""Die Hard"" is rough, tough, violent, hair-raising stuff. Although somewhat overextended at two hours and 13 minutes, it never gets dull. Director John McTiernan, who'd already proved his abilities on *his* breakthrough movie, ""Predator"", guides it all in style, and he and his crew are up to the challenge of shooting sequences in some tight spots. Michael Kamens' music is thrilling, and the special effects by Richard Edlunds' Boss Corporation are most impressive. Often very funny (with a generous dose of quotable dialogue), the story has genuinely touching moments as well. The big finish is especially riveting.<br/><br/>True filmmaking craftsmanship results in superior visceral entertainment the entire time. Four sequels have followed it so far.<br/><br/>In closing, it would be impossible to imagine a fan of this genre not having a copy of this movie in his or her movie collection.<br/><br/>10 out of 10."

","Die Hard was one of those movies that just didn't disappoint. Bruce Willis was perfect for the role. His bad attitude, and it being used in a building full of terrorists was a perfect match.<br/><br/>Alan Rickman was great in being the nemesis, he is eerie, and you get the total feeling that hes such a dangerous villain. Bonnie Bedelia was also great as Johns wife being held hostage.<br/><br/>The action scenes? what can i say? for the time it was made, this movie has not dated at all. In fact its more realistic in its making compared to to other action flicks with over the top CGI. This move is a classic, go watch it!"

","This is probably one of the best action films of all time! Die Hard is about an average cop who lands in the wrong place at the wrong time. It's Christmas Eve and New York cop John McClane flies out to California to spend Christmas with his family. While at his wife's Christmas party a group of terrorists seize the building, and John has to save his wife and her corporation or die trying. Before this movie came out there had never been a movie like this. What made this story interesting was the idea of one man taking on 12 terrorists with no help it makes the movie dramatic. But in the midst of all this action there a a lot of humor in the movie that make you crack up. Bruce Willis makes John McClane come to life as this wise cracking cop who does not have help to take down the terrorists. On top of that there's lots of explosion and gunfire that makes this a true guy movie. Overall I give this movie 10/10, because of the story, the acting, and all of the action in it."
"ElMaruecan82","10","1","2","31 October 2011"," A new kind of heroes, a new kind of villains, a new kind of action films ...
","""Under Siege"", ""Air Force One"", ""Cliffhanger"" or ""Passenger 57""...no action film was like ""Die Hard"" before and every action film was like it after: this is the definition of a milestone. And this privileged status has been conquered by John McTiernan, in 1988, through one  no, two masterstrokes : the casting of Bruce Willis as Detective John McClane and Alan Rickman as his archenemy, Hans Gruber. <br/><br/>All the Oscar-nominated special effects of the world, spectacular sequences or heart-pounding gun-pointing moments would have been equally worthless if we had to deal with a one-dimensional villain or a heroic killing-machine à la Stallone or Schwarzenegger. No disrespect for Arnie, but his decision to turn down John's part is probably one of greatest blessings of cinema's history, if only for launching the cinematic career of Bruce Willis. But there's more to say in this casting that justifies the iconic status of ""Die Hard"".<br/><br/>Bruce Willis introduced a new kind of hero, combining the strength of a regular cop who's been doing that since eleven years, and the qualities of a regular man, with a wife and children. He's charming, but not a womanizer, he's strong but hates to risking a neck-break, he cares for his family, for innocent people and for his duty, but his wisecracking attitude doesn't befit his deeply noble nature. And he has a strange habit to talk to himself, just like we might talk to him, if we could. John McClane is what we could call a buddy-hero, one that immediately inspires sympathy. Any regular guy would like him because he's not an intrepid adventurer like Indiana Jones or the playboy who gets all the chicks like James Bond, and more interestingly, because everybody's against him, even the Police or the FBI. John McClane is the quintessential guy at the wrong place and the wrong moment, the pebble in the shoe, the pain in the ass, whom no one seems to give a break... and if only for that, we identify with him.<br/><br/>John McClane is indeed one of the greatest movie heroes, and if this is too pompous a superlative for him, let's say one of the coolest.<br/><br/>And for a new kind of hero, the movie needed a new kind of villain. And here comes the suave and charming Hans Gruber, a man who uses his sophistication as a rhetoric trick to hide the true evil and menacing side of his nature. At one part, no one would dare to challenge his opinion on Gruber, for a guy who could lead such a bunch of cold-blooded killers, had to be at least twice more determined and violent than the most violent of them, Carl his sidekick, to name him. As soon as his gun is pointed at you and if you don't have weapons, you're already dead, and be careful if he compliments your suits, it might mean that he'd hate to make some holes in. Hans Gruber, rightfully nominated #46 in AFI's Top 50 Villains, is the kind of villains that would have made Hitchcock very proud, and from Lecter in 1991 to Landa in 2009, a few villains of the last years would lack this mix of suaveness and cruelty.<br/><br/>Hans Gruber's influence on villains' characterizations is undeniable and Alan Rickman steals the show in an Oscar-worthy supporting performance, his eyes language is so powerful that most of his reactions could pass for genuinely authentic.<br/><br/>But does it take only two iconic characters to make a film? Yes and no. Yes, because once you have the characters, and you define their personalities, their interactions and dynamics will provide enough material for the script. From a memorable ""Now I have a Machine Gun Ho- Ho-Ho"" or the ""Yippie-Ki-Yay"" catchphrase, the conflict between a regular guy and a foreign mastermind is a cinematic delight. But again, Hans is such an extraordinary character that he even takes distance from his role as the big villain, admitting he borrows more of his knowledge from stuff read in Forbes, or Time. And no, because the movie still needs a story, a back-story, about McClane, his family, to paint him with the brush of realism; there's a scene where he has a breakdown with his only trust-worthy friend and partner (Sgt. Powell, played by Reginald VelJohnson) where McClane takes this unique dimension I was mentioning before. Could you imagine Arnie crying like this?<br/><br/>There's also this constant originality in the film that makes every single scene memorable. Action is never for the sake of it, after several viewings, you understand exactly what John is doing and the whole process to save the hostages. And in the same time, we follow the Germans in that cat-and-mouse situation. John is indeed trapped like a mouse, with his vest and bare feet (another unique touch of the film) but sometimes, the mouse even when outnumbered, can use his cleverness, his reactivity, and courage to defeat the bad guys thanks to the surprise effect, and a little something that makes him such a hard nut to crack. Now, of course, the purists will criticize the Germans' accents, the unrealistic incompetence of the Deputy Chief of Police or some useless comedic relief moments, they wouldn't be totally wrong but when we're supposed to believe in a man able to fight a group of terrorist, couldn't we suspend our disbelief a little? This is not too much asking from a masterpiece of entertainment that paved the way to a new conception of hero and villains and a new generation of action movies, almost all of them can be tag-lined as ""Die Hard in someplace"". <br/><br/>Indeed, ""Die Hard"" gave its letter of nobility to 'pop-corn' and 'guy' movies to a point, I can imagine, a villain saying now, in a monologue ""This time, John McClane won't come here to save the day """
"itamarscomix","9","1","2","23 September 2011"," An action classic
","John McClane was a breath of fresh air after the series of heavy-muscled, unapproachable action heroes who dominated the 80's - Stallone, Arnie, Van Damme, Norris. If anything, McClane was the child of Dirty Harry Callahan; and if Harry was the ultimate badass cop for the 70's, McClane filled that role in the 80's and early 90's. Even more so than Callahan, McClane was a hero every viewer could identify with; wise-cracking, neurotic, short-tempered. It's the character that made Bruce Willis a star overnight, and made Die Hard one of the defining films of its genre. And even if parts of it seem dated, and a lot of the supporting actors do a cheesy job, Willis and Alan Rickman are both spectacular enough to hold the whole thing together, making it a constantly thrilling and wholly enjoyable movie even twenty years later."

This movie is one of them. Die Hard,which is the biggest action movie of 1988 blows you away, completely. Bruce Willis plays John McClane, a New York cop, who is in Los Angeles going to a Christmas party in a skyscraper. He is just another cop who is off duty and just attending the Christmas party to be with his wife. We learn that Willis' character is a struggling person who is trying to keep the relationship with his wife going. Then, terrorists invade the building, seizing off exits and entrances. The terrorists' leader is played by Alan Rickman, who has a great performance as the evil Hans Gruber. Everybody in the building is held hostage and that the only person who is not a hostage is John McClane. He has only one shot to fight against the terrorists and his has to use his wits and skills to fight back. Soon enough, the police and F.B.I arrive to control the building. All I can say is that Die Hard has a number of great action sequences and a lot of great performances by Willis and Rickman.

"jacco59","9","1","2","11 May 2011"," An epic action classic
","First off, you should know that I rarely give out points higher than 8 (in fact, the only movie I've given a 10 yet is Pulp Fiction), so 9 is an incredibly high rating for my standards. This is a movie that changed the action genre forever, and since it's release there have been many copies of it. But anyway, back to the movie. Willis being a fairly unknown actor before Die Hard, this is the movie that launched his career, And it's understandable why. His acting is an important part of what makes this movie so epic, because many of the scenes feature just him, operating on his own against Gruber and his crew, and throwing out some incredibly funny lines when talking to Gruber and that black cop, who is by the way another important element of the movie. He's such a typical cop, lazy, eating donuts in the car, but when things get serious, he's alert and helpful. But finally, THE thing that makes this movie so awesome is the action. Action like we'd never seen it before back in '88, raw and uncompromising, spectacular and bloody. McClane (Willis) gets hurt and shot so often you find it hard to believe he can still walk, let alone run, but that doesn't matter. If you take this movie too seriously, you won't enjoy it. So, when you go watch this epic, just sit down and enjoy the action without thinking about it, because that's how it was meant to be watched."

","Believe it or not, this is the first time I have watched Die Hard. Yeah it's been on TV tons of times, and I only saw snippets but I sat down and watched the whole thing properly.<br/><br/>And what a ride it is! Die Hard takes a simple premise and turns it into a slick action, suspense film. Bruce Willis is perfect as John Mclane who doesn't abide by the rules in order to save a floor of people from getting killed by some captors - led deliciously by Alan Rickman. I don't know if Rickman did a perfect job with the German accent but he is still very effective in his role - mainly because he isn't a stupid character that makes stupid mistakes as in most films of this genre.<br/><br/>And it is also Mclane's character that makes you root for him - his cool attitude makes it very easy for you to go along the ride for him. And the other cop in this film who talks to him via walkie talkie represents one of the cops that actually have sense in these situations instead of the usual red tape that makes it harder for people to do their jobs properly.<br/><br/>The director keeps the pace of the film steady so you aren't left hanging too long - it knows where it wants to go and it doesn't waste time building up unnecessary melodrama to fill in the gaps - because it wouldn't really work here. This is an action film and one that is done very well and is highly enjoyable from start to finish."

A chain smoking, foul mouthed and down to earth New York cop, who's instantly likable the minute he's on screen. He's come to LA on Christmas Eve to meet his estranged wife at a party in the Nakatomi tower, hoping to rekindle his marriage. Unfortunately, after McClane has a wash, terrorists take over the skyscraper and take the guests hostage. Now, alone, bare foot and fighting for his life, McClane goes to war with the terrorists, to save the hostages as well as his wife. It's not Shakespeare but it's smarter than your typical 'hero kills bad guys' situation.<br/><br/>What makes Die Hard so revolutionary is how realistic and ground based it is (Atleast in Action movie terms). McClane fears for his life and would prefer the police take care of the situation instead of him. He doesn't run in guns blazing but instead sneaks around the building taking down terrorists one by one. The Skyscraper creates the perfect action setting and give the film a claustrophobic atmosphere. Through the course of the movie he gets bloody, beat up and injured depicting him as a real person. Not that any of this should turn you off, McClane still is cooler than ice and has a great sense of dark humour, filling the film with funny and memorable one liners.<br/><br/>The terrorists are great to, each having their own personality and each being recognisable from another. The team is led by Hans Gruber, played by Alan Rickman who makes the character instantly memorable and a ton of fun to watch as a suave and cunning villain. The film also has great pacing, starting off slow but as soon as the terrorists arrive, the film snowballs into a fast and furious pace.<br/><br/>There's not really anything else to say that has not been already said. A clever plot, memorable characters, solid acting, a ton of action and many quotable lines. The film is a classic by all mean and not only is it arguably the best action movie of all time, but because of it's setting at Christmas, makes it a perfect 'Anti Christmas movie' as well which is great around the holidays. Highly recommended for everyone."

","Bruce Willis's character Detective John McClane has become legendary. He is walking barefoot and wearing a vest all through the film and saying a phrase in the film that has become world-famous. <br/><br/>This is macho exemplified. Talk about action and it has to be a John McTiernan film, right? The legendary director of the film Predator (1987) starring Arnold Schwarzenegger yet again scores a hit.<br/><br/>Plot? Who needs a plot in an action flick? On the other hand a good plot surely helps an action film, and this film is no exception. The plot is solid, the stage is set for McClane and its up to him to stop the baddies from fulfilling their objective.<br/><br/>Plot: Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) leads a team of thirteen terrorists to the Nakatomi Plaza building to steal $640 million in bearer bonds from the Nakatomi vault. When Nakatomi executive Joseph Takagi (James Shigeta) refuses to reveal the code for one of the vault's seven locks, Gruber executes him.<br/><br/>Unknown to Gruber, Detective John McClane (Bruce Willis) of the New York City Police Department who is also a guest in the building witnesses this event.<br/><br/>McClane moves through the building, hiding from or killing the terrorists he encounters. He learns more of their motives while acquiring a two-way radio, C4 explosives, and detonators from the body of one terrorist. McClane uses the radio to attract the attention of the LAPD, who send Sergeant Al Powell (Reginald VelJohnson) to investigate.<br/><br/>Who will prevail McClane or Gruber? Watch this film to find out more... or just BUY it on DVD/BLU-RAY.<br/><br/>Die Hard follows its source material — Roderick Thorp's novel Nothing Lasts Forever — closely, much of the film's memorable scenes, characters, and dialogue taken directly from the novel. Nothing Lasts Forever, a sequel to Thorp's earlier novel The Detective, was written with the intention of being adapted into a film sequel to the film adaptation of The Detective, which starred Frank Sinatra. When Sinatra turned down the offer to star in the sequel, the story was altered to be a stand-alone film with no connections to The Detective.<br/><br/>When Die Hard was released, it was highly acclaimed by critics and was considered one of the best action films of its era. Based on 50 reviews collected by the film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 94% of critics gave Die Hard a positive review, with an average rating of 8.2/10.<br/><br/>The film has 3 sequels Die-hard 2, 3, and 4.<br/><br/>The film also spawned the PC games, Die Hard Trilogy (1997) and Die Hard: Nakatomi Plaza (2002)."

","Has there ever been an action movie made that is a more perfect representation of the term ""man movie"" than ""Die Hard""? Die hard has all of the elements that you would want in a no-holds-barred action flick - guns, guts, glory, bare breasts, and a hail of bullets.<br/><br/>The story centers around New York detective John McClane (Bruce Willis), who is on a trip to LA to meet up with his estranged wife at her office (a high rise in Century city) during the holidays before eventually heading home with her to spend Christmas with her and his two children in an effort to patch their family back up. One hitch though, the high rise is taken hostage by a militant group of terrorists armed to the teeth and highly technologically advanced and intelligent. The terrorists are led by the suave and ultra-creepy Hans Gruber (portrayed wonderfully by Alan Rickman in his big screen debut) who seemingly has left no stone unturned and has considered every possible detail and prepared for every possible contingency, except one. While everyone in the building is under the thumb of Gruber and his men, McClane manages to slip through the cracks and soon finds himself hopping secretly from floor to floor taking out the bad guys one at a time, until the final, heart pounding, white knuckle finale that is one of the best endings in movie history.<br/><br/>This movie is expertly directed by action-veteran John McTiernan (who finished post-production on another quintessential man-movie, 1987's ""Predator"", just before principal photography began on ""Die Hard"") and benefits from the talents of cinematographer Jan De Bont (future director of such Hollywood blockbusters as Speed and Twister), whose break neck, fast paced style of film has become his trademark. The film is perfectly cast and the ensemble that is put together for this film is one of the finest groups of talent on any one film in cinema history.<br/><br/>The quintessential 1980's action thriller, ""Die Hard"" has become an iconic film and has entertained the masses and been a staple ""man movie"", and although the film is over two decades old now, it is still going strong and still appealing, even to today's film audiences."

","You know that irritating cliché: ""rip-roaring roller-coaster ride""? Invented here: DIE HARD. The original and best. Action movie that carved a template for action movies - back in the day when even white guys could be terrorists.<br/><br/>This close to being a pissant B-Action-Movie, DIE HARD is where TV's smarmy David Addison transitioned to Being Bruce Willis.<br/><br/>Lost the hair. Gained the muscle. Still smarmy.<br/><br/>Directed by John McTiernan (PREDATOR, 1987), with Jan de Bont as Director of Photography (a lauded action director himself now, starting with SPEED in 1994, often referred to as ""DIE HARD on a Bus""), DIE HARD became such a shorthand for action movies that pitches would start ""It's DIE HARD on a boat,"" or ""DIE HARD on a plane,"" until - the apocryphal story goes - some genius started his studio pitch, ""It's DIE HARD in a building""...<br/><br/>John McClane (Bruce Willis), a New York cop, arrives at the Nakatomi Tower skyscraper in Los Angeles, invited by his estranged wife, Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) to attend her company's Christmas party and spend a few days (""Come out to the coast, we'll get together, have a few laughs..."").<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Euro Bad Guys are sealing off the building, dispatching the perfunctory ineffectual security guards, then crashing the Nakatomi Christmas party with their automatic weapons and Euro accents.<br/><br/>Led by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman, deliciously taking big bites of cheese), we discover these terrorists are after the Nakatomi vault. Everyone hostage. Except McClane, the fate of the hostages in his wise-cracking hands.<br/><br/>Thus is birthed McClane's own brand of Everyman, sweaty t-shirt, fly-in-the-ointment action-heroing, as he avoids capture by shimmying through Nakatomi's unfinished floors and elevator shafts, killing the terrorists one by one, throwing spanners into the Euros' plans while blowing things up.<br/><br/>Waitaminute - this is starting to sound like ""DIE HARD in a building""...<br/><br/>During the siege, McClane allies with a beat cop on the ground via walkie-talkie, Al (Reginald Veljohnson), who can only talk in clichés. Paul Gleason, direct from THE BREAKFAST CLUB's (1985) detention room, is Police Chief Dwayne T. Robinson, and if he had his petulant way, everyone here would be in detention.<br/><br/>Suddenly - Ellis! What a scream! Hart Bochner brings the smarm like a smarm junkie on smarm steroids, sideways-mouth, fastidious beard, waggling head, pick-up-line 'tude, smokin' ego, coked nose, coming onto McClane's wife... trying to smarm his way out of hostage situation.<br/><br/>""I close million-dollar deals for breakfast... Hans - booby!"" Ellis negotiates with McClane via walkie-talkie to stop throwing spanners and give himself up, so that the Euros can do their bad stuff in peace and everyone can go home. (Now we know the 80s loved the venetian blinds look - from movies to music videos - but in the offices at the top of Nakatomi Tower, where Ellis negotiates with Hans and McClane, there are no other buildings as tall, no other light sources higher than Nakatomi, and it is night - yet everyone in the office is COVERED in venetian blind shadows!) Ellis fails, pays the price. And Gruber's albino sidekick (Alexander Godunov) goes hell-Euro to kill McClane, as does Gruber himself, to no avail. McClane is just too slippery and his t-shirt too grubby, to be caught. We find out that Hans Gruber's takeover of Nakatomi is more prosaic than it would seem at first - they are not terrorists, just ""exceptional thieves,"" going for 600 million in Negotiable Bearer Bonds - until The John McClane happens.<br/><br/>With Beethoven's Ninth Symphony motifs running passim, DIE HARD explodes from one action sequence to the next, nary a breath in between, loaded with every action movie cliché that didn't know it was an action movie cliché until a decade later: the callous FBI, the ranting Police Chief, the rebel policeman flatfoot, the renegade lone cop out of his jurisdiction (is that three-clichés-in-one?), pretty orange explosions, outlandish action sequences (why must McClane take a fire hose off the roof when he could've run down the stairs with the other hostages? Stairs not good enough for Action Heroes?); the downed Bad Guy coming back to life for one last scare-thrill...<br/><br/>Though we would not realize it at the time, this first DIE HARD was thankfully 'R'-rated, so the profanity and violence was at a premium. Though the action is all hyperbole, the offhanded swearing lends this piece a harsh reality when it comes to bad men and the Action Heroes who love to fight them - something which the makers of LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD (2007) sacrificed for a wider, younger, dumber audience.<br/><br/>From a novel by Roderick Thorp (Nothing Lasts Forever); bet Thorp would never have guessed The John McClane would actually last forever...<br/><br/>--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania)."
"sme_no_densetsu","8","1","2","8 April 2009"," Quite possibly the definitive action flick
","""Die Hard"" stars Bruce Willis as a New York cop who may be the only hope for a group of hostages held captive by terrorists in an L.A. high-rise. Unfortunately, his attempts to foil the terrorist plot are met with little assistance from the police at ground level. To paraphrase one of the film's taglines, the odds are against John McClane and that's just the way he likes it.<br/><br/>The cast is actually pretty solid for a shallow action flick. Bruce Willis is an ideal action hero; he exudes a mix of brains, brawn & attitude. Alan Rickman, as head terrorist Hans Gruber, delivers a memorably villainous performance. The supporting cast isn't bad either, sporting the likes of Reginald VelJohnson, Paul Gleason & William Atherton.<br/><br/>John McTiernan's direction is ably handled and the action set-pieces deliver the goods. In fact, I was surprised at how well the special effects have held up. The Michael Kamen score is a pretty good one which features variations on Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. There are a couple of nifty soundtrack choices as well.<br/><br/>In the end, this is perhaps the definitive modern action film. There may be a few cheesy moments but they detract little from the overall experience. I heartily recommend the film, especially to action junkies."

"Anonymous_Maxine","10","1","2","10 November 2008"," ""Only John can drive somebody that crazy!""
","In what has to have been the highlight of Bruce Willis's hardcore action movie career, Die hard is a nonstop adrenaline packed thrill ride that even manages to avoid the Rambo effect, where the single hero takes down the whole world around him. John McClane is just a regular cop, he's just really good at what he does and he's thrust into a situation where he can either act or be killed, or let a lot of innocent people be killed.<br/><br/>A group of terrorists, led by Hans Gruber (a delightfully sinister Alan Rickman) has taken a building-full of hostages in Los Angeles and are demanding the release of prisoners in Northern Ireland, Canada, and Sri Lanka. Clearly this is a pretty lofty goal, but it's only a cover to buy time while the terrorists go after their real goal, which is to steal the$ 640,000,000 in bearer bonds in the building's safe.<br/><br/>What makes John so convincing and so human is that he has not come here to save the world, he came because he's a New York police officer but his wife got a job in Los Angeles that he didn't think she would keep. She has become more and more comfortable, so he came all the way to LA to try to convince her to come back to New York to be with him. <br/><br/>What follows is one of the most skillfully crafted action movies in the genre. Director JohnMcTiernan made his name with this movie, even after the similarly impressive Predator the year before. Robert Davi turns in an outstanding performance as the FBI agent assigned to take over control of the situation from the incompetent LAPD, and the movie even takes time to take a jab at the press, which nearly blows everything near the end of the movie.<br/><br/>Note: There is a point in the movie where we see a gas station which is selling unleaded for $0.75 a gallon! Makes me wonder what gas prices are going to be like in another 20 years! I do have one question though  why does it rain paper at the end of the movie? White Christmas?"

","John McClane (Bruce Willis) has just landed in Los Angeles at Xmas time. A New York City cop, he is going to spend the holidays near his estranged wife, Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) and his children. Holly, a rising corporate star, was offered a high echelon job for a Japanese conglomerate and she accepted the position. This caused a deep rift between the couple, for John is a born-and-raised Big Apple resident and he doesn't want to leave the city, no matter how big his wife's salary is. Over the holidays, they are going to try to come to a resolution. Yet, when John enters the skyscraper headquarters of the Japanese company, his wife is committed to helping with the holiday party that is in full swing and he goes to a washroom to clean up. Just at that moment, a German terrorist, Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) and his gang take over the building in a near-perfect seizure and the employees are turned into hostages. The German thug is after the million dollar bonds that are locked away in a heavily-fortressed vault. Meanwhile, McClane manages to slip away to the elevator shaft to spy on the crooks. It is John, then, who witnesses Hans executing the Japanese CEO when the businessman does not give the gang leader the combination fast enough. Hans, it seems, believes that the computer expert he brought with him will be able to crack the code. As it may take hours, however, John has some time to find a way to stop the killers. But, can one man really do the impossible? This is a very exciting film, with plenty of white-knuckle action and suspense. It launched the career of Willis into superstardom, of course, and spawned three sequels. As the never-say-die cop, Willis is terrific, cracking jokes as he tries to pick off the enemy one by one. Bedelia is nice, too, and the rest of the cast, including Alexander Godunov, is first rate. As for Rickman, he is superb as the cold-blooded terrorist with the eloquent voice and style. It really brought his career to the forefront, too, and his performance ranks high among those of the evil villains of film. The action takes place mostly inside a building, so there is no great scenery, but it manages to make every nook and cranny of the edifice into a battleground. Costumes are fine and the production values are high. Best of all, the script and direction are truly inspired, as the struggle between the good guys and the nasty ones is thorough and exciting. If you are looking for a movie to get you in the Christmas mood, this one may do for those twisted minds out there or, rather, for those who want a bit of action in their holiday films. So, show the children something like The Polar Express or Elf, then send them to bed, for Die Hard is strictly for adults only."

","Brute force, sheer determination and a vaguely plausible plot line. This is all that is needed to enable a good film in the 'action' genre, but where and how does Die Hard assert itself as potentially the greatest action movie in history? Is it through the new found talent of Bruce Willis, whose rugged looks and obvious 'action' physique enable him to leap down elevator shafts? Or is it the introduction of a new supercharged yet surprisingly normal New York City police officer-John Mclean? Whatever it is Die Hard seems to have captured the essence of an action movie to win it a definite place as one of the best 'action' movies in history.<br/><br/>Alan Rickman's soft German accent seems to add a menace to the film, with the obvious double-crossing no nonsense villain. Again though, Die Hard appears to have some sort of edge over other action movies as it evokes an odd sense of what a true 'mad' villain would behave. However, is this intentional or is this the acting of Alan Rickman? I don't know, but what I do know is that the director stopped just before the line of 'believable' to change the film from a boringly 'moral' action movie, to a fun yet gripping movie. The explosions and fight scenes leave nothing to be desired, and Bruce Willis helps the introduction of a non-superhero, but thoroughly super-human character. Die Hard would top my list as one of the greatest aesthetically pleasing films I have ever seen. The action never bores me and is the sort of film I could watch over and over again."

","My Take: A yardstick in which to measure your explosive summer action blockbuster. <br/><br/>When it comes to action, no other action cop movie that ""dies harder"". I'm not going further than saying DIE HARD is one of the best, if not he best, cop movie around. The film starts out slowly, but soon explodes with non-stop action scenes and an edge-of-your-seat pace, without giving less humor for a cause. DIE HARD is among those films I classify as ""Great Action Movies"". These are the action movies that act like roller coasters, wherein the action moves at an incredible pace which forces you to hold on for dear life on the edge of your seat or maybe have you looking for a seat belt on your chair.<br/><br/>Much of the charisma and wit comes from the goodness of the film's hero. Of course, this is John McLane, played with real zest by Bruce Willis. Willis gives his character that charm that makes him stand proud and apart from other action heroes (as in Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones). But with every good hero, there's a good villain. And that good villain is Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman), the leader of a terrorist gang who invade a high-rise during a Christmas Eve party to rob a multi-million dollar wealth.<br/><br/>Secretly, McLane hides behind the dark corners of the building, taking on the terrorists one by one while also having communications with a downtown cop (Reginald Vel Johnson) who are parading outside the building. And, of course, there is also a major pain-in-the-butt that gets in the way, and that is a downtown Deputy Police chief (Paul Gleason), who is well-colored, but just plain incompetent. I think he's just their to do a set-up which we know will fail, which will definitely result to a lot of explosions or cops getting shot. McLane, of course, provides a few of his fireworks including the use of plastic explosions by throwing them down the elevator or dangling on a rope after an explosion in the rooftop.<br/><br/>Yes, DIE HARD is indeed a very busy action picture with some very terrific special effects. Few action movies today, with all the money for effects, work can even topple the fantastic effects here, which were more realistic. Director John McTiernan deserves as much credit as the effects masters and stunt coordinators. He gives the film an incredibly fast pace and keeps the action going, and doesn't forget the humor in the screenplay.<br/><br/>When it rummaging around the video store, make sure you get DIE HARD on your list. It's not THE best, but it's a terrific, riveting and sometimes funny action ride that never gets old.<br/><br/>Rating: ***** out of 5."

","The original ""Die Hard"" is definitely worth a second look. Compared to much of the action fair being produced today, such as the Bourne films and the later ""Die Hard"" sequels, the first ""Die Hard"" stands up as probably the action movie by which all others are judged. The action sequences are tempered by good character development, an interesting heavy, a bit of humor, and a plot that sounds believable enough to take us all the way into the story. There is something to be said for a movie that restricts its scope to an office building, instead of running all over the country, or the world for that matter. The writing is tight and lean, with 0% fat.<br/><br/>First, it's not wall-to-wall action. An old adage in art says that sometimes less is more. Action sequences definitely fall into this category. Filmmakers today believe that piling on action sequences like pancakes and smothering them with butter and syrup makes the movie more intense. In reality, the opposite is really true. By withholding an intense sequence, and then having it occur spontaneously has much more punch, and believability. Savor the sweetness, and let there by a little wait for the next one, like the next course of a fine gourmet meal. And part of it is not just the action sequences. The baddie of the movie, Hans Gruber, played with sinister charm by Alan Rickman, is often as compelling as the action. The well-tailored but emotionless criminal is a perfect opposite to John McClane, played by Bruce Willis in the role that catapulted him from comedic TV personality to movie superstar.<br/><br/>The story allows for adequate character development which in turn makes the action sequences more meaningful as we are drawn to care about the characters and what happens to them. McClane is certainly a savvy copy, but he's also an uncultured hot-head who would probably prefer a Big Mac in front of an NFL game to an evening at the opera. Simultaneously, we learn he is a devoted father and wants to make his marriage work. A working class cop that wouldn't know which side the fork and knife go at a high-class dinner, but he is an honorable man. And the script gives just enough hints to allow the viewer to put two-and-two together. On the other side, Hans Gruber would know all the operas by Puccini and the important paintings by Van Gogh, not to mention who's's who in academic circles which makes him so much more terrifying. At the beginning of the film, he spews out the biography and resume of the CEO of the company in which he and his cohorts have infiltrated. Slothful big-mouthed bandits are no longer bloodcurdling. It's the cultured, well-mannered and soft-spoken assassin that gives far more goose bumps, especially because it hides evil agendas. Villains don't wear Gorgio Armani suits, or do they? Gordon Gekko, who nears Gruber in amorality, is a far more terrifying monster than the Mummy could ever hope to be.<br/><br/>Lastly, the plot and setting are narrow in scope which again emphasizes that less is often more. The story centers around a multinational corporation that has offices in Tokyo and Los Angeles headed by a Japanese immigrant to the US who rose to prominence through hard-work and ethics. At a Christmas Eve party to celebrate the success of the company, high-class burglars masquerading as terrorists break into the building (Gruber at one point appears insulted when it is suggested they are terrorists), take the employees hostage, and demand access to their high-security vault which is apparently lined with about 2/3rds of billion dollars. Because his wife has become a prominent executive in the company, John McClane happens to be there at the party and evades being captured by the ""terrorists"". The story then centers around McClane's battle to free the hostages and stop the terrorists. Simultaneously, he also has to battle the Los Angeles law enforcement bureaucracy which becomes a kind of sub-plot to the movie.<br/><br/>Overall, a very satisfying viewing experience, and of course highest honors go to the screenwriters, and to Bruce Willis who is the common thread that holds the entire story and movie together. Unfortunately, few movies since Die Hard have been able to capture such a blend of character, story and action into such a film."

","I must say when i first heard the titles name ""Die Hard"", i thought it sounded like a really bad movie but as a surprise it wasn't, in fact it was great!. The actors are good and Bruce Willis does a great performance. Some things was a little awkward, like that guy who hanged from a chain around his throat for a half an our and then turned back just fine afterwords and starts to shooting everyone, but i really didn't care i thought it was just fun. And ""Alan Rickman"" really puts up the definition ""Evil"" in this one, as he have done in a lot of movies, like Harry potter. But more to the point: this is a great Action movie with a descent plot, and its worth every penny..."
"freaky_dave","9","1","2","6 August 2007"," The first is still the best of the four
","I liked Die Hard with a Vengeance, and Die Hard 2, and I also enjoyed the fourth film in the series, but the original Die Hard is still the best of the four movies. It introduced us to John McClane, a role that would become Bruce Willis' most successful character, and gave us one of the best action films of all time.<br/><br/>John McClane (Willis), a New York police officer, flies to LA to meet his wife Holly (Bonnie Bedalia) who has transferred there because of a job. Their marriage is strained, and this is McClane's attempt at trying to mend the problems between them and keep the marriage working. Enter a group of terrorists led by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman in a much earlier role before Harry Potter). The terrorists quickly cease control of the Nakatomi Tower where Holly works, and suddenly there is a hostage situation. McClane manages to escape and becomes the only salvation for the hostages and himself in a standoff which pits him alone against all the terrorists. <br/><br/>Die Hard is one fantastic action film. The story is very well done, and the action and pacing is incredible, as it moves at breakneck speed. John McTeirnan, the director, not only gives us great action, but he gives us believable characters. Casting Alan Rickman as the lead villain was smart because with a film like Die Hard, you need a villain who is as good as the hero, and Rickman is up to the task with Willis. <br/><br/>Between all the gun play and furious battle sequences, we have some minor roles that are also given some time. Reggie Johnson as Sgt. Al Powell is wonderful in a role as the first officer of the law that McClane comes in contact with over the radio. Bonnie Bedalia, as McClane's wife Holly, also plays a good role.<br/><br/>In fact just about everything in this movie works until we get to meet Police Chief Dwayne Robinson (Paul Gleason). His role in this movie should've been cut, since he really has nothing at all to do except be wrong all the time in every situation. He even has a few one-liners which fail miserably because his character is so completely incompetent, you find yourself wondering how he got the job of police chief in the first place. It is because of this one character that Die Hard loses a star.<br/><br/>Overall Die Hard was fast, ferocious, fast paced, and offered some great stunt sequences and explosions. It's too bad that we had to have one annoying and useless character as a big flaw in and otherwise superb action thriller."

"warisdead","Null","1","2","24 July 2006"," A surprising psycho drama from McTiernan
","John McClane (Willis) is a New York cop making his way to LA to warm the relations to his ambitious and estranged wife. When there he is greeted by a fancy office party which leaves him feeling disconnected and alienated. As the hectic festivities progress something snaps inside our 'hero' and leads him to cause a total panic inflicted chaos by pulling out his duty gun and firing around frantically. It appears (though quite confusingly because of McTiernan's highly ambiguous editing) that deputy McClane is suffering some kind of a mental collapse and fantasizing a terrorist attack threatening his wife and her co-workers. By acting as a savior in the only way he can, (in his mind he's the super cop) Willis' character is going to fight his wife back from an imagined workplace affair. McClane's ego-tripping is registered by the outside world in the form of a lone cop who establishes a walkie talkie connection with McClane. By swallowing McClane's inane ravings whole the cop creates an intense juxtaposition with real events (which are shown through McClane's haze). McClane hunts down the horrified workers one by one and fights the intervening SWAT team as the on-lookers follow the spectacle outside,<br/><br/>McTiernan's genius lays in the mixing of two realities, McClane's own subjective delusions in which the building's been attacked by German terrorists and some objective flashes as seen by the LAPD and FBI. The film ends in a pleasingly grotesque way as the hero, passed out by loss of blood dreams of holding his wife as a hero and a survivor."

","Die Hard is about as perfect as a straightforward action film can get. By straightforward i mean with the guns, explosions, thieves and terrorists kind of formula, rather than films like star wars and predator which are in a whole different league! The character of John Mclain is great, an all American cowboy who is having a really bad day, the cast is good (with Allen Rickman as the main bad guy), it's got the Christmas theme gwanin, the storyline unfolds nicely, and it's the kind of film u can watch again and again and know it's gonna cheer you up. Until recently i'd only seen it when I was a kid, whereas I'd seen Die Hard 2 and Die Hard With A Vengeance numerous times, but trust this is far superior to the sequels. I'm not the kind of guy that's generally into action films, but Die Hard really is brilliant, just absolute perfection within the genre."
"Was_Here","9","1","2","23 December 2005"," Possibly the best action movie of all time!
","How to make an great action movie: First you need a (male!) hero, this dude has to have some sort of personal or mental problems. He also needs a striking humor! Then you need, of course a bad guy with some sort of catchy name, something a bit more clever than for instance ""John Smith"". It's vital that the villain and the hero is not from the same country. Usually the crook is from the middle-east (terrorist) or Europe (Nazi or rich asshole looking for more money). The plot is usually not that important. But if it's original and make you say ""Wow!"", then that's just another star in the book. Two more things: Beautiful, gutless Women and an extreme amount explosions. Everything which in real life will not explode, no matter how many times you shoot at it with a Beretta or UZI, has to explode!! If all it takes is someone to kick the item, it still has to explode! And the explosions has to be incredibly large and flamey. A toaster being shot at with a slingshot has to make the same amount of flame as 5 kilos of napalm!!<br/><br/>If you add all these things up, you'll get... TADAA! Die Hard! And Die Hard = Movie worth watching over and over and over again!"
"sol-","Null","1","2","23 October 2005"," My brief review of the film
","A well-made action film with an excellent technical side, the somewhat convoluted plot takes a backseat to the action and thrills, yet the film still delivers its excitement well. The characters are quite run-of-the-mill, including a very typical hero, but at least Alan Rickman manages to bring a bit more to his character: something sly and mysterious. Paul Gleason's character is an annoyance and a waste, but he is fortunately not giving too much screen time. There is too much time though spent on useless supporting characters in general, and the messages about marriage and relationships are too obvious to be effective. Still, if not quite a masterpiece, this is energetic stuff, very good of its type, plus there are some moments of comic relief well worked in."
"Jawd_Alistair","10","1","2","30 July 2005"," Die Hard = Best action movie ever!
","Whoah! I used to watch this film all the time when I was little, and I still watch it whenever I get the chance. John McClane is 100% macho action man, played brilliantly by Bruce Willis, John McClane beats heroes such as Terminator, Batman, and everything else. He is just an ordinary policeman off duty when terrorists happen to seize the building he and his wife is in, along with a whole group of other innocents and its up to McClane to save the day! The action is fast paced and very tense, it really leaves you on the edge of your seat!! The villains are very tough too, and some of the meanest you'll ever watch on screen.

"Aaron1375","9","1","2","8 July 2005"," A very effective action movie.
","This is one of those movies so effective in its delivery that it almost makes you uncomfortable to watch. You have your cop in a giant office building that has been overrun with high tech bank robbers posing as terrorist, and his wife is one of the hostages. Not only that, but the poor guy doesn't have any shoes which really makes an uncomfortable scene when the glass starts to fly. Willis is great as the lead character and Rickman does an excellent job as the bad guy as does the other guy who was a Russian dancer or something before defecting here. Great performances by the other members of the cast as well. The action is great, though at times they really seem to be throwing it at our hero and things seem to be going badly. Many memorable action scenes including the roof explosion and McClain (Willis) swinging to safety on a fire hose, his many encounters with said villains and a particularly good ending with the main villain. Don't think it is all action however, as Bruce Willis adds some comedy by means of very funny quips that add a lot to the flick. Still though at its heart it is an action movie first and the action comes fast and furious."
"blazingheat","10","1","2","4 July 2005"," One of the best movies of all time
","This movie alone impressed me so much it made me a huge fan of Bruce Willis, who I wasn't a big fan of at the time I saw this.<br/><br/>Die Hard is a great thriller that remains just as good even after watching it 20 times. I own this movie and I watch it once a week at the least.<br/><br/>One of the most likable things about this movie is the humor that's mixed into the action. It's very rare that an actor can be good at both action and comedy, and Bruce Willis is one of those rare types of actors.<br/><br/>The casting is all but perfect. Bonnie Bedelia does a great job as Holly Gennero/McClane, Alan Rickman is superb in his role of Hans Gruber, leader of the terrorists, and the late Alexander Godunov is equally as good as Karl, Gruber's right hand man. Reginald VelJohnson is just as good as Al Powell, the officer who supports McClane in his battle with the terrorists, and the rest of the cast, though fairly minor, also pulls off great performances.<br/><br/>This movie is a great buy, and if you're into watching movies as much as I am, it's worth watching frequently.<br/><br/>Final Score--10/10"

Anyhow, in my opinion this and ""Raiders Of The Lost Ark"" are the greatest action movies ever made. Why do I love Die Hard so much? I guess because the film isn't about CGI effects and merchandise.

"adrongardner","10","1","2","12 January 2005"," One heck of a ride
","Die Hard is one heck of a movie. When I first saw it 14 years ago, some time after it had hit video and HBO, my eyes had been opened to a new type of film. <br/><br/>I had seen so called action movies before, but nothing held my attention as Die Hard did. The violence was shocking and at the same time, exhilarating. Only years later would I see the effect the movie had on John Woo and his references to Die Hard in both The Killer and Hard Boiled. The villains were clearly bad, but there was a good deal of charisma they carried along with some welcome humor. The bad guys in many 1980s action flicks all tended to be some evil grinning villain happy to scream, shoot and rape their way to nirvana. In Die Hard, Hans and his GQ group of terrorist/thieves shoot when necessary and have enough human quality to make them believable and entertaining. I had only known Bruce Willis from watching his great turn as David Addison in the TV show Moonlighting. He was witty, smart, and funny. I didn't know Willis could expand until I saw Die Hard. Yes he carries a quiet presence in The Sixth Sense, but I still think he does his most entertaining work in the original Die Hard. He is strong, but funny. Angry but not ranting as the cop from New York. It is a performance full of confidence and fun.<br/><br/>The construction of the film is fantastic. Michael Kamen's music score is memorable, Jan de Bont's great lighting give the film a signature look to complement director John McTiernan's skilled use of the camera. The sets are all well made and play their part, as the Nakatomi building is indeed a character along with the other supporting players.<br/><br/>The sequel ""Die Hard 2: Die Harder"" was not much but blood and bombs. The bad guys were all mean, ugly, grinning paper cut-outs. There were some memorable pieces to Die Hard with a Vengeance, but they all lack the qualities that made the original so good. You can't just throw in a bunch of bullets and call it a Die Hard movie, that much is sure.<br/><br/>The action scenes are fantastic and much emulated. The gun play is messy, loud, and exciting. Again, the level of violence was unlike anything I had seen in 1991, (Yes it came out in 1987, but I was only 7 years old). The sight of a terrorist's legs bursting into chunks becomes a common one as John mows down his opposition. I love the scene where Willis drops the chair rigged with C4. ""They're using artillery on us!"" ""No you idiot its not the police....Its him."" Fantastic. The jump from the roof with the fire hose is another classic moment filmed perfectly in slow motion.<br/><br/>As I watch Die Hard today in 2005, one can see continuity errors abound. Plot points don't quite add up, and one begins to wonder how this movie could ever be remade, now that every guest on the 30th floor would have a cell phone to call the cops.<br/><br/>I love watching Die Hard. It is a movie made with a skill from a group of incredibly skilled people. Now days as its been ""Die Hard on a this or Die Hard on a that"" this level of originality is hard to come by in action movies. Why watch any knock off when the original is just as entertaining as it was in 1987. <br/><br/>**** 10/10"
"Mr Parker","10","1","2","5 January 2005"," ""You shoulda heard your brother squeal... when I broke his f*****g neck!""
","This may sound stupid to those of you that think that the only movies that should be considered quality works are period pieces and Merchant Ivory productions but I honestly think that this is one of the greatest and influential movies ever made. Hang him high, you're probably saying. I say, hear me out.<br/><br/>I saw this in the theaters when it came out back in 1988, which would have put me at fourteen at the time. I remember clearly, thinking nothing about this movie going into it. It had Bruce Willis, who really didn't strike me as the action hero type, being familiar with him only from the TV show, ""Moonlighting"". The trailer for the film said nothing more than, ""GET READY TO BE BLOWN THROUGH THE BACK OF THE THEATER!"" or something along those lines, coupled with lots of rapid fire editing and explosions and gunfire and no real hint at what the story would be about. It didn't occur to me that I would be walking out of the theater feeling like I had an idea of what to do with my life.<br/><br/>I credit this movie with giving me the desire to make my own films. I've always loved movies and have always appreciated their artistic and production values but for some reason, this was the one that had me saying afterwards, ""Wow, I would love to give people the same feeling that this movie gave me"". This was the one that really hit home.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis creates one of the most enduring screen heroes of all time with hard edged cop John McClane. Think about it, when you hear the name, don't you just know that trouble's right around the corner? He was the perfect antidote to the ridiculous peak of the action films of the 80's, where you had Schwarzenegger traveling to remote islands and wiping out entire platoons of soldiers single handedly in ""Commando"" or Stallone massacring entire nations of troops in the Rambo movies. Come to think of it, I'm surprised that Stallone didn't tie one arm behind his back to even things up a little. But I digress. In John McClane, we have a hero that is a little closer to the regular joes who walk the streets, someone who knows that he isn't bulletproof. In his fear, we see ourselves and I love that about the character. Yeah, his smartass jokes might get on your nerves once in a while but it only serves to make the character that much more endearing.<br/><br/>Then you have Alan Rickman. I can only think of one other movie villain who I'd consider about as good as he is here and that's Gary Oldman in ""Leon"" (or ""The Professional"", for those that aren't familiar with the film's original title). Alan Rickman as Hans Gruber is the best thing since canned Vienna Sausages in this film. In fact, I'll just leave it at that. If you haven't seen this movie, do so and see why I say that. If you have already, I know you've agreed with me already.<br/><br/>Now, the action sequences are something else entirely. John McTiernan directs with expertise and all the action scenes are pulse-pounding, to say the least. The scene where McClane jumps off the roof of the building with a fire hose tied around his waist goes down (for me anyway) as a moment I'd put up with Moses parting the Red Sea in the Ten Commandments. One thing I remember clearly about this scene was how insane the audience I was with got during that moment. Classic.<br/><br/>There are a lot of other things I can say about this movie but I really feel like it's better left for those of you who haven't seen it to experience for yourselves. I really, really believe that this is probably THE greatest action movie ever made. A human story, great action, great villains, great supporting players, great special effects... you can't ask for more. <br/><br/>RATING: ***** out of *****."
"AwesomeWolf","10","1","2","29 December 2004"," Excellent
","'Die Hard' - a near perfect action movie, and one of Hollywood's most influential modern-action movies. The movie follows a simple formula, a formula which has been repeated over and over again since 'Die Hard': A cop finds himself in the middle of a terrorist plot, with many hostages involved and no escape.<br/><br/>In this case, John McClane (Bruce Willis), a New York city cop, has flown to California to spend Christmas with his family and try to fix up his relationship with his estranged wife, Holly Generro McClane (Bonnie Bedalia). Holly works for the Nakatomi Corporation, and her boss has invited John to the office Christmas party, and he just happens to be out of sight when European terrorists take the party goers hostage. With John locked in, and the police locked out, its up to John to save the day.<br/><br/>Simple plot formula aside, the movie is well written and well directed. The way the story progresses is great, and should keep anyone interested all the way through. The actors are great, 'Die Hard' still easily being Bruce Willis' best movie. He isn't some dumb, macho cop who shoots first and asks questions later - he is smart, and despite his brave front, he is just as scared as the hostages. Credit to Alan Rickman too, for bringing the villain Hans Gruber to life. 'Die Hard' easily outshines director John McTiernan's other great efforts in 'Predator', 'Hunt for Red October' and 'Last Action Hero'.<br/><br/>All that and I still haven't mentioned the action yet. Running over two hours, 'Die Hard' is a bit long for a regular action movie, but this no regular action movie. Sometimes there will be action-free periods of time as the plot further develops, but the film is still action packed, and features some very cool action sequences, and the obligatory action one-liners are gold.<br/><br/>'Die Hard' - an excellent action movie - 10/10"

","After many years have passed I have to say that this movie kept me hanging as it did when I watched it was seems now like ages ago. The Sheriff of Nottingham was the main villain (I don't think he could ever play a good guy with his expressions but just as well because he's always perfect as a downright evil mastermind). This is basically what made Bruce Willis and rightly so, he did do some of his best acting in it. All the bad guys were pretty good, the only character that really got on my nerves was Ellis because he was just such a sleaze. I thought it was cool that the father from ""Family Matters"" (Reginald VelJohnson I think) made an appearance as a cop because he really is such a great actor yet you don't get to see him in too many pictures. This film is still exciting to watch and I definitely recommend it for this upcoming holiday season (as they play many Christmas songs throughout)! Yippy-kay-yay.<br/><br/>Final Innuendo:<br/><br/>Movies : I was an 80's child and even so I unfortunately missed this opportunity.<br/><br/>DVD Purchase : I could definitely see myself watching this once yearly.<br/><br/>Rental : A fantastic idea!"

","It is hard to believe that it has been 16 years since this great movie first came out and it is still one of my favorites. However, it is one of my favorites, NOT because of the action sequences and explosions, etc. It is a favorite because the writer wanted to make a strong statement about the adverse results of arrogant and incompetent jerks in positions of authority.<br/><br/>I can start with the hotshot executive, Harry Ellis, who upon his introduction to John McClane is consuming the stereotypical executives' 80's drug of choice, right on the desk top. He quickly shows off Holly's (John's estranged wife) watch to John and comments with an arrogant tone...""it's a Rolex"". Then we have the 911 operator who assumes that John's phone call is a hoax. Move on to Deputy Police Chief Dwayne T. Robinson who wants everyone one to know that he is the man ""in charge"". He patronizes and ridicules Sgt. Al Powell's (the co-hero) intuition and wisdom and calls in the SWAT team commander, another man ""in charge"", who has to send in his ""R.V"". ""Now you ask for a miracle....I give you the FBI"", as head terrorist Gruber says, with FBI agent Johnson and FBI ""special"" agent Johnson who quickly tell Deputy Robinson that THEY are now ""in charge"". So they ""follow the anti-terrorist playbook step by step"" which happens to cause the unlocking of the electro-magnetic seal...which happens to be the last obstacle for the safe that Gruber and friends are breaking into. And last but not least, I must mention the desperate reporter who goes as far as going to McClane's home and interviewing the children live on the air...of course the terrorists have the television on and........JERK!!! <br/><br/>This is NOT an action thriller. That is a disguise to sell tickets. In my opinion, this is a cleverly written, soul-searching drama which must make you wonder if you are one of the jerks in the movie and have any of your decisions adversely affected others. If so, hopefully you realize your flaws and save the day. THIS MOVIE IS A CLASSIC"

","Die Hard<br/><br/>John McClane is in California to visit his wife, whom he is seperated from due to different dreams of careers and he hasn't been able to handle he succes in her new job. But it's christmas so he comes to see his family, while picking up his wife at her firm, a group of terrorist shows up and holds all guests as hostages, John McClane manages to escape and is now the only hope to save the hostages and alert the police.<br/><br/>Overall action movies are always very similar and predictable, and this movie is too predictable, perhaps that is the only big weakness of this movie, because who can deny there is something special with Die Hard. Die Hard is simply a very progressive, accelerated and perfectly paced action movie, not only does it tell a good story, and even comes with a few complexes, it also brings some of the best and most solid action ever to be seen.<br/><br/>John McTiernan has proven to be a solid action director over the years, after the breakthrough with Predator he made this classic action flick, that never seems to be getting old, even now. 17 years later, it still works as well as it did 17 years ago, brilliant.<br/><br/>This is just what I suppose we can call a perfect popcorn movie, the kind of movie where you lean back and just let the thrill ride begin, you know things will end happily, but still it entertains for the 2 hours it lasts, and it entertains at a very high level. Perhaps one of the weaknesses of the movie is the happy ending, I would have loved a darker ending, leaving something to think about, especially since there obviously is the problematic climax involved in the movie, there are some good side stories, especially the dramatic with John and Holly's marriage. Strangely that works out perfectly and we get to know everything about it, even though the movie actually doesn't spend much time explaining, it's just done so well and perfectly direct that we basically know everything about these two when the movie ends.<br/><br/>I am not sure if this was a final breakthrough for Bruce Willis, but he definetely shows in this movie what great actor he is, we see a lot of different sides of him, the tough guy, the soft guy, and even better, the funny guy. I hardly ever lÃ¡ugh in movies, and I hate unserious movies that are trying to hard to make you laugh, but the jokes in this movie are perfect, especially the one signed by Bruce Willis, I loved his attitude, perfect performance!<br/><br/>To sum it all up a bit, as we always do. This is a really great action classic, an unforgettable movie that never gets old, no matter how many times you watch it, this must be like the 5th time for me, and it's still highly entertaining, it has no slow moments and just moves out there at a perfect pace for 2 hours. The weak sides is perhaps that it's such a classic and traditional action movie that we know the end before the movie starts, sadly, an ending that would have left me breathless would have been better for me, but maybe other people think differently. I just like dark endings.<br/><br/>8/10"
"montymarmotte","10","1","2","19 June 2004"," Not to be arrogant, but this film rules!
","I'd say this film is the best in the world, but that would sound arrogant. So I will simply say this: Die Hard is brilliant. It defined the action movie, and came up with an original idea that could be stolen for many years to come by films such as Under Siege. John McClane (Willis) is trapped in a LA skyscraper with 12 terrorists and a heck of a lot of hostages.<br/><br/>Directed by hit-and-miss director John McTiernan, responsible for the likes of Predator and The Hunt for Red October, but blamable for bringing us Rollerball, this film shows style, coolness and a slightly tacky, sarcastic undertone that follows deep friendship, beating fears, and regrets.<br/><br/>I wish I could put this film on the podium it deserves, but I can't afford a podium, so I'll just be arrogant.

","If you watch 'Pulp Fiction' and then immediately try to watch 'Die Hard', you'll probably throw up. The reason is that 'Die Hard' lacks style, it's got Schwarzenegger dialog and the humor is for 8 year old kids.<br/><br/>'Die Hard' is written to please everyone. The story is simple, or even too simple, there are no plot holes, but it lacks the depth of movies that would probably confuse some of us. It is superficial in every way and the supposedly dramatic moments are sappy.<br/><br/>Still it's fun to watch. Gets to the point of becoming irritating but never crosses it.

John McTiernan sure packs a punch, I can tell you that. The best thing about this film is that it's just a movie. It doesn't try to be anything but a formulaic, by-the-numbers, big budget action hit and so it works spectacularly for what it's trying to achieve. Provided you don't expect a masterpiece of filmmaking, what you'll receive is a masterpiece nonetheless.<br/><br/>There's no need to analyse this film much further, it's a thrill ride, utterly shallow and hopelessly artificial.

","Okay, let me start by saying a couple things: I am not a huge fan of violent/action/cop thrillers, and as this seems to be the 'classic' for a fan of that particular genre, I may not be the best person to listen to...however...<br/><br/>The realism of this film is waaay off. Brucie does not stand a chance against the brains of Hans Gruber (and, may I mention, his swarm of Russian terrorists armed with machine guns) The guy must have been really lucky, since he is at close quarters with the terrorists in many scenes and still survives (I mean point-blank here). <br/><br/>Did anyone notice how the color of his shirt changed in the middle of the movie? I mean, white to olive green? How did that happen (sure hes climbing around in air ducts and all, but still...I mean solid here...not just 'dirty') <br/><br/>There is one scene worth watching...(for those of you who've seen it) Hans Grubers 'american accent'episode...but why would the cop have given him an unloaded gun? <br/><br/>anyway, I wouldn't recommend this unless you really like Bruce Willis, cop movies, or Alan Rickman...and even then I'm not sure its worth watching...;)"
"stuch","8","1","2","28 January 2003"," Action, Action, Brains.
","This film cannot be beaten in terms of action. Bruce Willis will always be remembered for starring in this. And rightly so, it is a non-stop thrill ride from about 20 min. in until the finish. Having said that, the first 20 min. are not boring, as time is needed to build up the characters. Which is where the other half of this film comes in. The brains.<br/><br/>Sure you can have guys leaping from skyscrapers or blowing up buildings, but there has to be a reason for it to happen. Also, unlike most action films, the 'bad guy' is the protaginist, and McClane, the 'good guy' is the antaginist.<br/><br/>Anyway, I could've written more, but that's the point I wanted to make, action films need more than just action."
"Bud_Sturguess","10","1","2","25 January 2003"," Finally an action flick the makers can be proud of
","In an easy candidate for the greatest action movie ever released, Bruce Willis plays John McClane, a New York City cop invited by his separated wife (Bonnie Bedelia) to her place of work in L.A., a forty-story skyscraper, for the company's Christmas party. In an ironic, almost implausible, but very entertaining twist of events, the building is seized by thieves under the guise of terrorists, led by German Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman in one of his most unforgettable roles). And of course, Willis evades the submachine-gun wielding antagonists throughout all forty floors, enduring pain, thrilling near death experiences, and shootout after shootout as he is pitted against the nastiest thieves ever to hit L.A. Aside from the obvious shoot-em-up thrillride, ""Die Hard"" boasts believable acting, and a plot that roots itself deeper and deeper into the audience's attention as the movie goes on. Willis's ability to make wisecracks amidst bullets and bombs is classic, and his tension with the L.A.P.D. and the F.B.I., locked outside and doing as little as they can to help, is dramatic and entertaining. Inevitably followed by two worthy sequels."
"MC ReXX","9","1","2","25 January 2003"," One of the greatest action movies, of all time.

As you watch this movie you definitely feel McClane frustration and pain. It shows that Bruce Willis is not a dumb-ass when it comes to portraying a character very well.<br/><br/>This movie also proves why John McTiernan is one of the best action movie directors in Hollywood (other than Rollerball of coarse).

He opens up to Powell a few times in the movie and isn't afraid to reveal his emotions. In addition, he doesn't come out with guns blazing and automatically know what to do-he actually stops and thinks about his actions.  Rickman makes an excellent villain.  He's very calculated and knows exactly what he wants. Supporting performances by Bonnie Bedelia, Alexander Godunov, Reginald VelJohnson, and even Hart Bochner and others are all great.

","I looked up action movie in my dictionary and it just said Die Hard. Die Hard is quit possibly the only movie i can watch over and over again, even though its not a movie geared at making your brain work, it is nonetheless a masterpiece. The storyline is quite simple, terrorists take over building to nick a shed lad of cash, end of story. Yet the way the story is crafted is a true work of genius and has yet to be matched by director Tierney. Yet who can blame him, Die Had set amazingly high standards.<br/><br/>What are the elements of Die Hard that make it successful? I think its the way that this particular action film is very similar to a western in its approach. Just think about it, a lone law enforcer (New York cop) turns up to single-handedly to save a village (skyscraper) from outside forces (terrorists) who threaten to disturb the peace (kill everyone). Add to this mix explosions, one on one gunfights and some killer wise-cracks from the hero, and you've got yourself the ultimate action film with the ultimate action hero. even the villain is great.<br/><br/>Die Hard is quite possibly my favourite action movie, nothing comes near it, not even the sequels!

","I'm an action movie guy, and if you are too -- you definitely should see ""Die Hard"". Plenty of stuff blows up, but that's not why it's a classic. Die Hard is a classic because all the characters at all times do things that are smart and make sense for the character. The film is devoid of silly little coincidences that mar the plots of other action films. And every sentence of dialogue, without exception, moves the plot forward. The film is very tight and well-plotted, similar to Back to the Future. Plenty of the action scenes are interesting and original.<br/><br/>There is one silly bit in the final sequence, but that can be forgiven.<br/><br/>Who should see this film:<br/><br/>-- anybody who appreciates action flicks, even a little bit<br/><br/>-- anybody who dares to see the occasional action flick,<br/><br/>see this one, Raiders of the Lost Ark, and Terminator 2.<br/><br/>I'll give Die Hard a well-deserved 10 out of 10."

","Die Hard is one of my favorite action movies of all time. The struggle of one man against a heavily armed group of terrorists in an enormous skyscraper is executed very well. You want to be Bruce Willis, you want to be sneaking around, hiding from and taking on terrorists. It's the ultimate hero fantasy, because the story has a sense of realism. These terrorist acts happen in real life and you could be a John McClane if it happens near you. What also works are small details like John's shirt getting slightly dirtier every scene and the running gag of him looking for shoes. It's all these things and more that keep you on the edge of you seat for 2 hours no matter how many times you have seen it. What also helps is that the 2 sequels it spawned where not lesser-copies. They are also truelly original and give the Die Hard trilogy the same status in the Action-genre what the original Star Wars Trilogy is for the Science Fiction genre. Die Hard has been copied many times (Under Siege, Sudden Death, Passenger 57 etc) but never did the copies reach the quality of Die Hard (Although Under Siege is pretty good)."

Bruce Willis' acting has never been better.  Alan Rickman makes quite an impression in his feature film debut.  Reginald VelJohnson puts a little more heart into the cliched 'partner' role.<br/><br/>The cinematography is awesome, just watching as you see the shimmers of light, and the overall chaos of what's going on around these characters. The camera basically makes us feel the plethora of emotions that these characters are going through.<br/><br/>And the best part is the music.

","Wow what a whopper, this beast was an instant classic of monster proportions, and it's easy to tell why - Bruce Willis on top form, getting his vest filthy for the first time and pouring out those witty asides, Rickman scorching as the teutonic baddie in his tailored suit, the constant stream of banter keeping the less active moments racing and those action set-ups to die for. But this is far more than just some jokes and some explosions, the whole setup is a masterpiece of cunning simplicity, one man against them all, trapped with nowhere to run and nothing to do but fight for his life, using the high-tech tower as the ideal arena for Willis' particular flavour of wiseguy superhero, with every move carefully prepared for and in keeping with the overall picture. The characters are believable and even charming, the dialogue constantly snappy, the music perfect, and the attention to detail fantastic - every character is allowed a bit of interest to make them all memorable (perhaps they were thinking sequel even then?), there's so much little stuff going on, so many minor details of plot that all just keep on ticking along until their turn in the sun arrives, the logic always totally on the money with none of the gaping holes in reason that typify yer average cheapo actioner.

Bruce Willis, unfortunately, has never bettered his work, John McClane is the perfect character we would all love to be witty, strong but also has emotions, he's the type of hero that could overcome the most preposterous obstacles but could still be hurt.

","Bruce Willis at his best.  Not that Sixth Sense is bad by any means.  But Bruce excels at kicking ass, and that's what he does in Die Hard.  One man, in the wrong place at the wrong time, is forced into taking on a group of terrorists to save his wife and about 30 other hostages.  It's a fast-paced action movie and it is just fun to watch.  There's a good bit of comedy laced in the midst of the action and that just makes it all the more enjoyable.  Can't really think of anything bad to say about this movie.  If you haven't seen it by now, what are you waiting for?  It's a classic."
"virek213","8","1","2","19 September 2001"," Not perfect, but far better than anything Schwarzenneger could muster
","With the exception of RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, DIE HARD ranks as perhaps the single best action movie of the 1980s.  This 1988 suspense thriller is not, in my opinion, a perfect film; but in light of all the morally rotten Schwarzenneger/Stallone shoot-'em-ups that we had been exposed to, and continue to be exposed to, it is as close to one in the testosterone action genre as there has ever been.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis ascended to stardom as New York cop John McClane, out on Christmas sabbatical in Los Angeles to see his estranged wife (Bonnie Bedelia), who now works in the forty-story Nakatomi Plaza in the Century City district.  The two obviously are at odds, but both have agreed to try to reconcile following an office party on the 30th floor.<br/><br/>But all bets are off once a group of heavily-armed terrorists, led by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman), seize the building and hold everyone at the party, including Bedelia, hostage while they try to break open the company's computerized vault and its bounty of bearer bonds worth $600 million. Willis, however, has eluded capture; and soon, he begins his own one-man campaign to wittle down the terrorists' numbers not so much through bullets as with his own brains.<br/><br/>DIE HARD has two flaws that I think keep it from being an all-out masterpiece.  One is that the LAPD captain in charge (Paul Gleason) acts totally idiotic, which is not anywhere close to being realistic.  Another is that the two FBI agents who take over the operation are so crazy that they make even the most unbalanced terrorist (Alexander Godunov) seem relatively sane.  It slows the plot down just enough to be irritating.<br/><br/>That said, however, these slow points are at least righted by solid performances from Willis and Bedelia, as well as Reginald VelJohnson's fine perfomance as the Twinkie-eating cop Al Powell, who has a sympathetic ear to Willis' plight over the radio.  Rickman's performance is one of the best villain roles ever conceived in Hollywood history.  Loosely borrowing elements from such films as THE TOWERING INFERNO and BLACK SUNDAY, director John McTiernan boosts up the suspense extremely well, even though some of the violence and profanity are a bit much.  Michael Kamen's pulse-pounding orchestral score is fairly unusual for an action film, but very welcome, as is the uncredited (though not by the Internet Movie Database) of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.<br/><br/>Not an unflawed film, but certainly superior to almost everything of its ilk before it, DIE HARD is extremely worthy as an action film of tremendous energy and skill."

","The top eight action flicks of the eighties: ""The Terminator"", ""First Blood"", ""Aliens"", ""Robocop"", ""the Predator"", ""Lethal Weapon 1 & 2""- and ""Die Hard"". Probably the least action-packed of the titles mentioned above, but I think it's the best of them! Always a pleasure to watch (done it already like 30 times or so) because it just clicks on every level: the direction is all good, the setting is original and well used (another bow to the director), the hero is physically limited (a little love handle around the stomach, maybe?) and vulnerable (and not just physically- the moment where McClane talks to Powell about delivering a message to his wife IS touching) and the villains are terrific, by the way there are 13 of them, not 12!<br/><br/>If you view one of the early trailers of ""Die Hard"" you see that the movie was marketed like just another ""reaganish""-action yarn; ""all-action, with an all-American hero kicking and especially shooting the s**t out of about a thousand foreign baddies in the name of apple pie and family values"". Surprising is that even when this movie WAS done in times like those, it has been done in a different tone, the outcome being something like a ""thinking man's action yarn"" with a slow pace (that still grows up into a climax), a nasty sense of violence and even a partial touch of realism. Probably this was because Ahnuld stepped out of the project and they had to make a brand new mold for Willis (who prevents Rickman from stealing the show with ""Hans Gruber"" by putting a little dark humor to John McClane, and giving him some of the coolest one-liners I've ever heard!) Whatever the reason, the gambling paid off and the outcome was a movie that doesn't seem to age off...<br/><br/>The sequels are both above par, but still clearly below the original DIE HARD."

It's funny, it's tense, it's beautifully photographed, and it is explosive.<br/><br/>But what sets Die Hard apart from others in its genre is the attention to detail the filmmakers have.  The characterizations are superb; there are no two-dimensional stereotypes here (ok, a few...but they serve a purpose). Almost every character gets to do or say something cool, and the villains are the best to come out of the Hollywood pipe...well, ever!<br/><br/>Words don't do it justice.  But this is perhaps the most influential movie to come out of Hollywood since Star Wars, and with good reason.  It changed the way Hollywood, and people, looked at action movies.

","I'm the kind of guy that likes action movies, but even I can tell the difference between a good action movie, and a bad one. Die Hard 2, is purhaps the best action movie ever made. And it will be for a long time. Too many action movies revert to the same old crap plot, the same old crap villian, and the same old crap villian. Almost every action movie that has come out in the past 15 years had followed this formula: Someone the good guy loves is in trouble, The Good Guy must find a way to save him/her/it through the use of guns, explosions etc. Although Die Hard follows this formula quite perfectly, its does one thing that most other action movies have failed to do: Die Hard does not take its self seriously. This movie knows that the audience wants to see big explosions, and lots of guns, so skip past all the dramatic BS, and get to the action. Die Hard is riddled with jokes that poke fun at itself and the action movie genre. It contains continuous references to movie/tv action heros and even has room for a schwarzenegger joke. This was the first big budget movie to do this, and thats what makes this movie great.<br/><br/>About Die Hard 2 and Die Hard With A Vengence, those were studio pushed movies made to cash in on the success of the first. Unfortunately, its hard to make a trilogy of self satirical action movies that don't suck. Hence, in the latter 2 movies the original goal of the first was obscurred by the fact that they took themselves too seriously. We need another Die Hard, soon, or else the action genre good be as lost as Val Kilmers sense of self worth."

","A barefoot, bare-chested Bruce Willis breaks the laws of gravity, the odds against good guys vs. Eurotrash terrorists, and Arnold's body count for a single film at that time, in the action movie that set the blueprint for everything that followed it, but rarely ever equaled it, (of course nowadays THE MATRIX took care of all that.)<br/><br/>When hard-bitten New York cop John McClain (Willis) flies to L.A. for the holidays to visit estranged wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia), about the only thing on his mind was not fighting with her for Christmas. He never dreamed in a million years he'd end up fighting for his life, which is exactly what happens.<br/><br/>Caught off-guard post-argument with Holly, and pre-completion of an after-flight freshening-up session, (the phrase ""making fists with your toes"" was made for trivia heaven!), he becomes every screenwriter's dream of the perfect action hero: an ordinary guy caught in extraordinary circumstances with the ability to rise to the occasion. When Nakatomi Plaza (actually Fox's Century City offices) is taken over by ""terrorists,"" McClain forgets marital woes and declares martial law in a one-man war against the armed intruders.<br/><br/>Big, belligerent and boisterous, this was the action thriller at its most Hollywood-outlandish, but one of the main things going for it is what most thrillers that followed came up missing: characters we care about. Willis' McClain is a wiseacre hard-ass with a smart-mouthed crack for even the diciest situation, (honed by his years on MOONLIGHTING), but unlike AH-nuld, he is no Superman, and even as we laugh at the Wiley Coyote scrapes he gets himself into, we wince simultaneously at every-near miss, be it flying bullets or free-falls through umpteen story windows, and cheer each time his pluck and determination to get the bad guys and save his missus, brings him through.<br/><br/>John McTiernan, who made his career with this film, (and was deathly afraid of heights while shooting it!) doesn't waste a single opportunity given him by the script to turn all the action set pieces up ""to ELEVEN!"" Michael Kamen's Sturm-und-Drang scoring does some nifty things with Christmas carols and Beethoven's ""Ode To Joy"" that were so original, everyone's been ripping off the score ever since, (including Kamen himself!)<br/><br/>Best of all, though, is the note-perfect casting job. Besides Willis, British stage vet Alan Rickman oozed oily charm, unctuous ambition and tons of bad attitude as lead ""terrorist"" Hans Gruber, who matched Bruce for every thrust and parry in their scenes together, both physically and verbally. Best of all, it's easy to see in the scenes that he carries without Willis, that Rickman is an actor with a future of memorable characters ahead of him, villainous and otherwise, (see him at his best in ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE OF THIEVES.)<br/><br/>Bruce was the one who initially suggested that John McClain have  a wife, and that she be played by Bonnie Bedelia. Smart move on Joel Silver's part that he took that advice, because as the ""damsel-in-distress,"" Bonnie comes across about as helpless as Bette Davis! The screen crackles with the chemistry between her and Willis as they argue like a husband and wife at odds, trying  to find their way back to common ground. And even when face to face with the baddies, she makes it clear that she's got bigger brass cojones than all of them combined.<br/><br/>As for the rest of the supporting cast, their characters have become archetypical staples in the action genre by now: Reginald VelJohnson's Sgt. Al Powell, John's one-man cheering section on the outside; Paul Gleason as the inept cop-in-charge who'd like to shoot McClain as much as he would the terrorists; Robert Davi and Grand L. Bush as the F.B.I. hotshots; William Atherton as the snide, sniveling, career-driven reporter he played so well, he'd be back in the sequel; James Shigeta as Holly's noble and doomed boss Joe Takagi; Hart Bochner as the hop-headed hostage and all-around jerk who thinks he can 'cut a deal' with Gruber; Devoreaux White and Clarence Gilyard Jr. as Argyle, McClain's driver, and a nerdy high-tech terrorist, respectively, and then on the bad guy's team, the late and still great Alexander Godunov, Lorenzo Caccialanza, and Al Leong as a greedy gunslinger with a sweet tooth.<br/><br/>At a time when action-starved fans were moaning that they didn't make 'em 'like they used to,' DIE HARD came along and proved them right. They didn't...now they were making 'em BETTER than that.<br/><br/>I cannot believe there is one movie lover on Earth who hasn't seen this at least once, so if you haven't, save yourself the rental bills you'll run up from repeated viewings, for God's sake, and just BUY it! It will become a permanent part of your library, I promise you. YIPPEE-KI-AY...."
"davidthiel","10","1","2","18 September 2000"," Why I believe Die Hard is one of the 10 best films I've seen
","Action films (like comedies) are usually dismissed from serious consideration.  Die Hard has questionable lineage coming from Silver/Gordon school of anything for a thrill.  But, every once in a while a project will go beyond its humble beginnings.  John McTiernan makes the difference.  So much is accomplished in its 131 minutes.  I have watched it many times and I don't believe that there is a wasted frame of film.  Action films are usually long on action and short on characterization.  But, Die Hard connects you with all the characters.  Our hero and heroine are important but the villains, this is where Die Hard shines.  And not just the bad guy but a host of bad guys with relationships (vengeance for a bother slain) and the Asian terrorist who while waiting to blow away the good guys gives pause before deciding to steal a candy bar.  Hans Gruber is fascinating as played by Alan Rickman.  Action sequences fail so often in trading off excitement for communication.  Not in Die Hard.  McTiernan knows how to show action. The editing is superb.  I have a list of 10 films that if I could only take 10 to a desert island for the rest of my life these would be the 10, and Die Hard makes my list."
"Die Hard-3","8","1","2","14 September 1998"," The mother of all action movies
","The modern action genre begins here with two words that will always be associated with action, Die Hard.  Probably the best movie ever stars Bruce Willis and will soon have spurned 3 sequels.  A group of twelve terrorists including Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) and Karl (Alexander Godunov) hold 30 executives hostage in an office building.  What do they want? $640,000,000. They are armed with missiles and rockets which they fire at an unfortunate LAPD.  The only man free roaming the building with only his service revolver is NYPD cop John McClane (Bruce Willis) who came to LA to visit his wife, Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) for Christmas.  The LAPD, led by Deputy Chief of Police Dwayne Robinson (Paul Gleason) are disbelieving and the only one on John's side is Sgt. Al Powell (Reginald VelJohnson). Explosions are great, but it is slow at times.  Overall, Die Hard is a thrilling ride through 40 stories of sheer adventure."

","Yes, this film might have raised the bar for action movies at the time, but it's become quite dated, & may I add, looks cheesy today.<br/><br/>If you like your action films loud, obvious, & all american, this is for you. I think it's far from a classic (a word that is used too easily)& doesn't have the staying power of say the Wild Bunch, the Taking of Pelham 1,2,3, or the French Connection. These films, while being action films, had a sophisticated & mature feel, while at the same time weaving social commentary into their stories. <br/><br/>Die Hard clearly plays to an audience (most in evidence with the cheesy one liners)The movie always seems to sense that there is an audience watching.<br/><br/>Yes, it may have raised the bar for action movies, but it's also responsible for a slew of even more excessive, shallow & cheesy action movies that came after it. After a while it became a question of outdoing the last big action film, so that meant bigger explosions, louder, more violent.

"Jacques98","5","3","15","20 December 2008"," One of the few movies I've seen in a long time that was entertaining.
","I'm not someone who tries to find the good in every movie. People who do that just overrated cinema and praise movies that genuinely were a complete waste of their time. I think that is why I hate most action movies that have been released in the 2000s. With the exception of a handful, it's a common trend for modern action movies to be cliché paint-by-the-number dramas with a few things blowing up in the background. This modern mindset that action movies have to have cliché drama elements or they're somehow worthless is a misconception that I never understood. I'm an action fan. I came for action. I didn't come for an hour and a halfliterally, sometimesof the buff action hero giving long speeches about how much he loves his one-dimensional kid with cancer. In this sense, Die Hard makes the biggest, most recent action blockbusters look pathetic. I'm very happy to write that its main focus is action; the other lame storytelling elements are all expendable.<br/><br/>With that said, Die Hard does something else I didn't expect. Something that no one gives it credit for. It's creative. If you look behind the terrorist plot, you'll see Die Hard doing things that no other action movie did before it. For one, it has the ""hero"" (who is really more of a pawn than a hero) completely in solitude for most of the movie. In a sense, Die Hard is almost a reverse slasher film. In slasher films the main bad guy kills people and he's never seen on screen until the ending. In Die Hard, the hero kills people and the bad guys have no clue who is doing it. Again, another thing no other action movie has had the creativity to do. Though the overall movie isn't anything entirely new (thus my somewhat low score), there are a hundred other details that make it far superior to the less creative action movies out there.<br/><br/>Die Hard also has a hardcore level of intensity that I've seen in very few action movies. It builds on a semi-slow pace that immerses the viewer in realism and allows them to care for the characters. The fact Die Hard can do this without ever once becoming tedious or boring is another aspect movies have lost in modern times. The key is in that there is never once an expendable scene in Die Hard. Every scene adds something to the overall effect of the movie, and without it something would be lacking from the overall effect. In opposite, modern action films pump the movie full of pointless talking scenes and pointless sex scenes and pointless drama scenes that add nothing whatsoever to the overall effect of the movie. Also, Die Hard gives the viewer credit that we understood the plot from the first trailer and doesn't need to sit and explain it any further. Modern action films hardly ever do that. Most recently in The Dark Knight, we had to sit thought an hour and a half of nothing but people discussing the cliché crime plot that we understood in full before we even went into the theater.<br/><br/>The directing is also far above average. Coming from the same man who directed Predator, I didn't expect anything less. The directing almost has an epic feel as the camera shows all the necessary rooms of the building without once showing something unnecessary to the overall effect. Again, a trait lost in modern action movies.<br/><br/>Overall, this film is a necessary watch for anyone who calls themselves an action fan. It's not a perfect movie, and it's not something completely alien to everything that has been done before, but it's entertaining. I watch at least two movies a day, and I can't remember the last time I watched a movie that I found genuinely entertaining.<br/><br/>5/10"

","Die Hard (1988): Dir: John McTiernan / Cast: Bruce Willis, Alan Rickman, Reginald VelJohnson, Bonnie Bedelia, Alexander Godunov: When a cop arrives home via plane for Christmas, he doesn't expect to battle terrorism inside a big office building. Bruce Willis plays New York cop John McClane whose fearless nature is tested when an office party that his ex-wife is attending is invaded by several men with guns. Naturally it is up to McClane to solve the situation by picking off the assailants one by one. Entertaining and tense although it sways during a last moment shooting in the conclusion that comes off as corny. Director John McTiernan scored success with Predator the previous year and here he makes great use of an office building. Willis brings guts and sarcasm as McClane narrowly avoids death and seems at odds in dealing with police. Alan Rickman makes for a terrific villain whose plans are botched when McClane makes off with his detonators. Rickman brings a sly sarcasm to the role that is particularly slick during his first encounter with McClane. Reginald VelJohnson plays the one cop willing to listen to McClane but the role is more or less a prop. Bonnie Bedelia as McClane's ex is pure cardboard. Alexander Godunov plays Rickman's top henchman whose role is to be a punching bag. Explosive action that isn't very demanding but it is to die hard for action fans. Score: 7 / 10"

"mgruebel","7","1","3","1 February 2014"," Classic one-liner action
","In the mid-1980s, a transformation of the action movie began. The gritty action dramas of the 70s, of which Gene Hackman vehicles like The French Connection, or at the B-level Charles Bronson's Deathwish were emblematic, gave rise to more cartoonishly violent but breezier fare, enlivened by one-liners and more oblivious to realistic plotting. Schwarzenegger, Stallone, and yes, Bruce Willis led these films. It was the era of the Reagan quip, and while that era has long ended, lesser such films continue to be made.<br/><br/>Without a doubt, Die Hard is one of the best of these. Off-duty police officer in skyscraper saves hostages from a suave but brutal master thief. What sets it off from many films in the genre is a loving level of detail. Like a criminal about to steal millions hesitating to steal a pack of M&Ms from a concession stand; or explaining why the hero will run around the whole movie in his undershirt in a logical manner; or having the hero actually hurt badly from walking barefoot on glass; and building up relationships in some detail.<br/><br/>It also shares some of the weaker points of the genre, from ludicrously incompetent higher-ups in the police or news business, to the monster villain who is resurrected just when everybody thinks it's over, to bad German accent/grammar coaching of the star villain, played by Alan Rickman. This is particularly disconcerting because his henchmen are all Austrian or German actors who hold flawless conversation.<br/><br/>Rickman is a superb villain though, affable and yet coldly brutal, who toys with the good guys by pretending to be anything from a terrorist (he's just a thief) to his own victim. The bad guys can be suave, smart and wear tailored suits.<br/><br/>The action is plentiful and well-paced, the one-liners including the famous yippee-kayeh are funny, the actors are doing a great job, and the score is clever, for example in the way it segues from the frolicky Bach music at a Christmas office party to an ominous version of Freude, schöner Götterfunken when the villains appear. It holds up well with time."

","The world has a new hero. John McClane (Bruce Willis) is a NYPD officer who's come to LA to reconcile with his wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia).

He's the everyman. He bleeds. He suffers. He wisecracks. He can talk in full sentences. He uses his brain as much as his muscles. He's just in the wrong place at the wrong time.<br/><br/>The action is big and grandiose. It takes the adage that bigger is better to its limits. Unlike Schwarzenegger and Stallone, the action seems bigger and crazier. Explosions roll off the backs of those muscle heads, but John McClane really suffers. That's the trick."
"GTeixeira","7","1","3","3 March 2013"," Classic dumb action that defined a genre
","It's hard today to think of action movies and not remember 'Die Hard'. The movie changed the genre of cop action forever, and for most still remains unsurpassed within it.<br/><br/>Tough NY cop John McClane goes to Los Angeles to visit his wife during Christmas in a try to reconcile with her. However, the building they are in is taken by terrorists, led by Hans Gruber, and it's up to McClane to stop them.<br/><br/>It's hard not to enjoy this film. It doesn't lose much time, has great action scenes and the setting of it all happening in a building allows for very interesting confrontations and tactics from both sides. Add that to Bruce Willis' tough, charismatic and smart-mouthed performance and Alan Rickman's great debut role, and you have an enjoyable 2 hour action movie to go for.<br/><br/>Yet, not all was good in here. It's hard to fault the main characters, true, but the opposite goes for the supporting ones. They are mostly too obnoxious, irritating or flat-out uninteresting, with the added insult of every other law-enforcing figure being made to look like an utter idiot in order to up McClane in our eyes (from the LAPD to the FBI, ESPECIALLY the FBI). The 'buddy cop' relationship was better than in most movies of its kind, thankfully, as the actor playing Al Powell was good too.<br/><br/>Finally, comes the plot itself. This is why I call this a 'dumb action'. How many people can you find that like Die Hard just for it's plot? Few. And how many can you find that don't even remember it? Probably many. The 'twists' in the motivation of Hans Gruber are just idiotic (especially his real plan, which is so full of holes I fell from my chair laughing when it was revealed) and the plot overall is either overly simplistic in some points or just illogically stupid in order to make their characters (ESPECIALLY the FBI) 'work'. Such a lack of good plot also troubles multiple viewings of this film, as there is only so much straight action can do without a plot to back it up.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a very fun movie to watch, and it's action sequences continue to resist the test of time. Just don't expect a deep and intelligent movie, and you will have a very enjoyable 2 hours."

"eckman03","8","1","3","2 February 2011"," Die hard is a great action thriller
","The movie Die Hard is a fast paced action thriller. The film stars Bruce Willis who plays New York Police Officer John McClane. In the movie John travels to Los Angeles to visit his wife and children. John's wife Holly who is played by Bonnie Bedilia has relocated to L.A. and has become a vice president for a corporation called Nakatomi. Shortly after when Jon arrives at the Nakatomi towers to see his wife at a Christmas party, a terrorist group led by Hans Grueber who is played by Alan Rickman seizes control of the building. John manages to escape capture and becomes involved in taking down the terrorists. John manages to inform the police and Sgt. Al Powell played by Reginald Veljohnson from the LA police department. The movie then turns into John McClane against 12 bad guys in a plot themed cops and robbers action type movie.<br/><br/>When a movies theme is a focus on plot, the movie is meant to be an escape from everyday life (Boggs, Petrie 2008). This is usually obtained by having very fast paced and exciting action. Die Hard definitely fits into this role. Wants the movie gets going it is pretty much nonstop action from beginning to end. There is lots of shooting and explosions and the special effects in this area are fantastic. Along with the plot theme there is another theme with a focus on character. In this case it is John McClane and how his character is developed. As the film progresses we start to understand John as the hero that he is. He doesn't choose to be, but he is thrust into this situation and his natural instincts as the hero are shown.<br/><br/>To go with the action plot theme Die Hard does a good job of using sound to establish the action that we see on the screen. Whenever there is an action theme we hear a very fast paced action type soundtrack. This helps to inform the audience of what is about to take place on the film. Another aspect that the film uses is camera angles. Many of the times that the camera shows John McClane, it shows him in a close up or from a down angle looking up at him. The close up shots let us connect with John and his emotions and the angles further emphasize the hero role as we all look up to him.<br/><br/>The movie Die hard is nothing new. There were action thriller before and there will continue to be action thrillers for as long as movies are made. A comparable movie would be another Bruce Willis film title The Fifth Element. Both films have a theme with a focus on the plot and lots of action and great use of special effects. Additionally both film focus on character. There is a brief description of the central character, with emphasis on the unusual aspects of the individual's personality (Boggs, Petrie 2008). In both film cases it was a wise cracking hero who is not everyone's favorite person, but when it comes to getting the job done and saving the day there is no better option."
"fidelio7","8","1","3","4 January 2011"," The best action film ever made
","Based on Roderick Thorp's novel 'Nothing Lasts Forever', 'Die Hard' is about an ordinary New York cop named John McClane (Bruce Willis) who goes up against a group of terrorists who have taken over an office building on Christmas Eve and are holding a group of office workers hostage, one of whom is John's wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia).<br/><br/>It is strange when you think that 'Die Hard' is actually a splatter film - witness the gruesome, closeup bullet hits in the 'Shoot the glass' sequence, and the very nasty scene which follows in which McClane nurses his bloody feet which are torn up when he is forced to run across a floor covered with broken glass.<br/><br/>One of the reasons 'Die Hard' is so good is that its central character is not a Superman but an everyman. He is clearly flawed, as his frosty relationship with his wife demonstrates. But he is very a likable man who always has a witty quip - often a quite profane one - with which to take the bad guys down a peg or two. Like Matt Damon's Jason Bourne, McClane is far from invincible, and by the end of the film he is seriously injured and covered in blood.<br/><br/>But the real ace up 'Die Hard''s sleeve is Alan Rickman's wonderful performance as the deadly and silky smooth Hans Gruber. Gruber is as sophisticated as he is merciless, and his charisma is nicely juxtaposed against his ruthlessness. He is a nice opposite number for McClane - while Gruber gets about in a natty designer suit, McClane wears a white wife beater which becomes rapidly discoloured when he is forced to crawl through an airconditioning duct.<br/><br/>Reginald Veljohnson offers excellent support as a Twinkie-loving cop who becomes McClane's only link to the outside world. And Bonnie Bedelia is great as John's estranged wife. Rather than a token damsel-in-distress, she is a successful and intelligent woman who is unafraid and unimpressed by Gruber and his team of terrorists. When Gruber asks her, 'What idiot put you in charge?' she rejoins, 'You did. When you murdered my boss'. Also great is Hart Bochner as the coke-snorting Harry Ellis who fancies Holly and who makes the fatal mistake of attempting to strike a deal with Hans. He too has some fun lines, like 'Hans, booby, what am I, a method actor? Put the gun away; this is radio, not television'.<br/><br/>Once the action kicks off, it never lets up, and it climaxes with John leaping from the roof of the Nakatomi Plaza - where the action of the film takes place - just before said roof explodes in a spectacular and wholly satisfying fireball. This film is action heaven for fans of the genre, but the thrills are countered and complimented by an intelligent and very clever script by Jeb Stuart and Steven E. DeSouza. The Director of Photography was Jan DeBont who would go on to direct another action classic, 'Speed'.<br/><br/>And the public's appetite for the 'Die Hard' franchise just seems to increase, with each film in the series grossing more than its predecessor. 'Die Hard' has been much imitated since its release in 1988, but so far remains unsurpassed."

","Die Hard is such a well made movie, the plot, its twists, the emotions, the shootouts, everything. In fact everything is so much well made that we completely overlook its weaknesses and accept the streamlined thrill ride presented to us. John Mclane is a NYC cop who travels to LA to meet his wife at a company Christmas party. The building where his wife works is towering and intimidating but his marital issues with his wife are that much more scary. However John hopes for a happy end to a stressful day and just embrace his wife, but no, a group of hi tech terrorists have taken over the building and are executing their well oiled plan to steal the company's billions. John of course will intervene. Kicking a** and taking names (litterally) has never felt so real and brutal before in a movie. Die Hard excels at excitement and changed the action genre forever. The subtleties and the glaring plausibility of the story makes it that much more intense, and even its hero seemed like the everyman. Thats what makes Die Hard so timeless."

","There can't be many people in the world who haven't seen this or at least heard how it influenced not only action films, but the whole way of making movies today.<br/><br/>Before this, action films usually featured a kind of überhuman, who usually were out of step with everybody else. For the most time, Willis is portrayed as the common man who is put in extraordinary circumstances.<br/><br/>Think back to Dirty Harry. Do you really think he would have a rapport with a guy named Al and have a jokey conversation about Twinkies? No way.<br/><br/>What Bruce Willis did was outstanding. He brought this cocky, slightly egocentric character into a world of ghastly situations and through an enormous amount of struggle come out victorious - and still you believe that he would rather lay on the couch with a beer in his hand and the game on.<br/><br/>As for villains, this has got to be one of the greatest ever put on screen. Alan Rickman, who was a complete unknown at the time, did a masterful job of playing this cool and ruthless sociopath. He doesn't have any redeemable qualities and still we kind of wish that he succeeds.<br/><br/>I have not read the source material upon which this movie is based, but I doubt that it could have been 1/10 as funny, scary and exceptional as this was when it was first seen.<br/><br/>Willis doesn't play this kind of character anymore. Even the recent Live Free and Die Hard had a much more tame McClane than the first three, but he has to be grateful that Die Hard happened to him. It made his career. Thank goodness or otherwise we might still see him playing an ugly wife beater like he did in one of his earliest appearances on Miami Vice."

"refresh_daemon","8","1","3","31 December 2007"," An example of how to make an action film
","This film remains remarkably entertaining even now that I've watched hundreds of quality films. The story is pretty simple, a bunch of highly trained and intelligent thieves crash a business party. Also happening to be at the party is New York police officer, John McClane. The thieves didn't count on John McClane and John McClane proceeds to ruin the thieves plans (that's no spoiler).<br/><br/>As far as I can tell, the real joy in Die Hard is how we get from one point to another. In addition to the main action, we meet a number of side characters and a couple of minor side plots involving L.A.'s finest and McClane's personal life, but don't worry--these don't get in the way of the action. The pacing is tight, the production values are outstanding, and the acting, though not demanding, is met well by the actors involved.<br/><br/>This is not an intellectual movie or one that provides nuanced emotional delivery. This is about close calls, shootouts, fistfights, dodging bullets and blowing stuff up. If you really stop to think about what's going on and the series of decisions the characters make it will seem ridiculous, but the point isn't to be a hard hitting realistic work, but rather a piece of pure escapist action fare and Die Hard hits it all with such a high degree of polish and charisma that it will sweep up most people in its destructive path.<br/><br/>I can only fault it for taking some immensely obvious and sledgehammer-like means to tell the story of McClane's personal life and also having some of the side characters, especially the deputy chief of police, the FBI and the television reporter written so exaggeratedly that they, not the ridiculous action sequences, cause some credibility gaps to surface in the film.<br/><br/>Think of die hard as a high quality hot dog. While it's still excessive, it's remarkably tasty and produced so well that you notice the faults of so many other hot dogs you've had in the past. This is an example of what a purely entertainment oriented action movie should look like. It's fun and simple and you don't spend time having to gulp down huge buckets of disbelief to enjoy it. 8/10."

No offense to Gleason, he has a few good lines and was a great actor, his character was useless here. That aside though, Die Hard is fun and the directing is solid, with a excellent performance by Alan Rickman."
"Antagonisten","8","1","3","1 January 2006"," One of the best
","""Die Hard"" is one of those numerous action movies from the 1980's with one strong hero and caricature-evil bad guys. And of course the obligatory outrageous body-count. It's also one of my favorites of the period.<br/><br/>I read somewhere that Arnold Schwarzenegger was first offered the role of John McClane but declined. Which is a stroke of luck to say the least. This is the movie that launched Bruce Willis action-movie stardom and he is one of the definite high-points in this movie. It also helps that he looks more normal than the beefed-up Arnold, lending at least a little more credibility to his character. The second high-point is of course the always excellent Alan Rickman as the German bad guy with the British accent. He has got to be one of the most memorable movie-villains ever. The third and final piece of the puzzle is the action-scenes. This movie has some of the best action-scenes produced in the 1980's to say the least. Many 80's movies were mostly about some huge body-builder standing still mowing people down. This on the other hand is a lot more refined. Willis is the kind of character that actually bleeds and hurts and feels vulnerable. And actually has to get out of the way when the bad-guys fire back...<br/><br/>The story of a team of international criminals wanting to steal 640 million dollars in bonds is not the most original story ever. But the claustrophobic ""nowhere-to-run"" theme of the movie set a new industry-standard and felt genuinely new. The fact that it's also exceptional in the action department and has actors to match makes it one of the most intensely enjoyable action movies to date. Recommended! 8/10"

","This film to me has and always will be the best action film ever made. Now granted there has been a lot of copies and action films these days are getting pretty good but in my view they are just carbon copies compared to this. Also John Mclane will also be the funniest and most bad ass character i have ever seen. Although Mal from serenity is up there as well. Who thought that watching a film for ninety minutes where the scenery hardly ever changes could be so good. I could watch this film so many times over and still be impressed. Alan Rickman was an amazing choice for a bad guy i just hope that the fourth in the series is not a disappointment."

","This movie is the coolest! There is lots of action lots of drama some comedy and some stealth action it was a big hit in 1988. I think Bruce Willis plays a great John McLain! Those terrorists better watch out with the man with the plan. Bruce Willis is an amazing actor. I like when he rolls on the floor to dodge bullets and he uses stealth if needed. I thought the stunts were done wonderfully. The music in the movie kept me pumped! The storyline has been done many times in movies but they were able to present it in a new and exciting way. I've seen many many villains in my movie going experiences but never more enjoyable than in this movie. Overall, I would recommend it to anyone wanting an exciting movie going experience!"

","Review: Die Hard<br/><br/>It was 1989. I was waiting for the bus with my friend Nick on Currie St. We were making chit-chat when he started telling me about this movie he saw last night, ""Die Hard"". He went on to explain this amazing story about how a cop was in a building, trying to save a bunch of hostages. How he had all these funny lines like ""Do I sound like I'm ordering a pizza"" and so on. It's now 2005, and the impact of this movie is still felt. I may be wrong, but from what I know this was the first movie like this- a maverick battling against the odds to try to rescue some hostages all by himself. It's spawned a bunch of similar movies ( Air Force One, Passenger 57, Under Siege, The Negotiator etc). The movie still holds up pretty well. Here's some highlights:<br/><br/><ul><li>This was Bruce's first major role. Previously he'd starred in the decent TV show ""Moonlighting"". Exceptional transition. Imagine Ray Romano, the guy from Will and Grace or Bob Saget pulling this off. I don't think so.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Bruce's character's name: John McClane. Awesome name. Totally sounds made up, which is the key to a good movie name. Generally you can come up with a good name by combining two different people's names.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The contradictions in the amount of homework the terrorists did to storm the building. It was manned by 1 security guard, yet they had this real elaborate plan of breaking in. On the other hand they didn't know what the director of the corporation looked like. C'mon guys.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Bruce Willis holds and uses a gun more convincingly than any other actor. No competition.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>That outfit Bruce ran around in for most of the movie was awesome (white tank top, brown pants, no shoes). Made the character. Wouldn't have looked half as good if he was wearing a tuxedo, skivvy and corduroy pants or jeans with a polo shirt.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>This line: ""You broke in hear to access our computer?"". That is so 1989. (a) That seemed like a revolutionary thought at that time (b) these days you can hack into someone's computer from the comfort of your own home.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Always strikes me in these movies it's lucky the main characters talk to themselves and crack jokes to themselves, otherwise these movies could be really boring, and we would have no idea what's going on.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>I'm learning lots from these movies about ""cop culture"". Here's some of the keys</li></ul><br/><br/>* You hate when the media rocks up, and generally the reporter * FBI and the local PD don't like each other. This i can understand. Imagine if at your work you're doing your thing and the national manager comes in and stops you and starts doing the job for you. * The head of the local FBI is generally an idiot. Normally the main character, who's a beat cop, can't believe the battle plan that's initiated. (The FBI guy's plan always fails too)"
"athena24","8","1","3","31 August 2005"," Left it's permanent stamp on the movie industry
","This movie is one of the best action movies of all time. I won't repeat others on why this is such a good movie, I will just agree with them. What I will mention is the impact this movie left on the movie industry. <br/><br/>Looking back at the 90's, you can see the influence it had, because this was something new. Die Hard was different from anything that had been done before that. This was a new style of action movies. I will give a small list of movies that were actually made by the receipt of Die Hard: Deadly Outbreak, Cyberjack, Sudden Death, Under Siege ( Originally, this was meant to be Die Hard 2), Under Siege 2, Air Force One, The Rock. I'm sure there's a lot more, some i don't know, some just can't think of. Everyone of this movies has the basic formula: Terrorist captures ""something""... There is ( sometimes there are) one (few) good guy (guys) in this ""something"" that takes over it from within, while it takes him most of the film to do it ( I mean that he doesn't kill all the bad guys in the same time, thus Executive Decision doesn't fall in this category, but does it slowly throughout the whole length of the movie). Non of the listed above came close to Die Hard, though some of them were OK."

","I guess this film was pulled from a few schedules after 9/11. It's not entirely clear why John McClane should have met his wife at the Nakatomi building, but a gang of robbers disguising themselves as terrorists hijack the building. They reckoned without McClane who turns out to be a thorn in their side and single-handedly stops them.<br/><br/>The relationship between McClane and Sgt Powell is a nice balance to the action. This is one of the finest action movies made and has spawned a lot of inferior copycat movies since."

","Die Hard shows us what kind of movies Bruce Willis used to make. Fun, exciting, funny movies. Now he makes crap, but Die Hard was back when he was in his prime. Die Hard has some of the best action scenes ever and has you pulling for John McClane all the way. Alan Rickman is great as the horrible uber-villian Hans Gruber. The setting of this movie in a skyscraper really lays out some good settings for action and this movie delivers. Bottom Line: A great action film and one of Willis's best."
"MovieLuvaMatt","8","1","3","8 September 2003"," Never gets enough credit
","Though I definitely can't say the film is underappreciated, it mostly gets appreciated for its action.  ""Die Hard"" is not just effective for its incredible stunts (and boy, they are incredible!), but also because it has a great plot!  Action works best when it enhances the film, and it rarely works when it IS the film.  The characters are very well-developed.  Bruce Willis' John McLaine is not a larger-than-life action hero.  He is a burned out New York cop out of his jurisdiction, who's separated from his wife. You can actually relate to his character.  Sure, it's cool to watch him blow away the bad guys, but what would you do in his situation?  Jump in front of the gunfire?  It's not just a cinematic device.  The dialogue is slick with such memorable lines as ""Yippie-ki-yay motherf**ker"" and ""No f**king s**t lady!  Does it sound it like I'm ordering a pizza?""  The movie manages to effectively combine a great plot, great action, a great sense of humor and even a little bit of heart.  Plus, Willis himself never gets enough credit for his role as John McLaine--a role in which he owns!  I heard Richard Gere was originally approached for the part.  I like Gere and all, but there's no way he could've captured McLaine like Willis.  First of all, Willis comes from a comedy background (anyone remember ""Moonlighting""?), so it doesn't sound forced when he says those funny lines, with a perfectly straight demeanor.  And he just has an everyman look to him.  You can imagine yourself bumping into a guy like this at a local bar.  And this is the dude who ends up saving the day.  Go figure.  Reginald VelJohnson (who many remember as Carl from ""Family Matters"") is great at playing the sympathetic cop, who's the only man on McLaine's side.  This movie proves he has definite range as an actor, and it's a shame his film career consists mostly of bit parts and cameos.  Here, he's given a supporting role, playing quite a pivotal character.  Paul Gleeson plays the stereotypical loudmouth police captain, whose job is to be hated by the audience and shoot his mouth off at the cop who's simply doing his job.  In a film of lesser quality, I'd probably point that out as a major flaw, but I was able to let that slide. Plus, it added to the fun of the film.  And English character actor Alan Rickman is terrific as villain Hans Gruber, pulling off a convincing German accent that's not over-the-top and maintaining a coldly terrifying demeanor throughout.  This is a film for everybody, even if you're not the biggest action fan.  ""Die Hard"" is good, solid entertainment that never ceases to please.<br/><br/>My score:  8 (out of 10)"

","Die Hard was a pivotal film in action circles. Reaching back to 1974's The Taking Of Pelham 1-2-3 for its basic approach, it deliberately shied away from the supremely confident heroes of the Rambo and Schwarzenegger genres and instead focused on a hero who is as scared as the hostages he is trying to rescue. It also got Bruce Willis' film career really flying after the disappointment of Hudson Hawk and the end of the TV series Moonlighting, and also introduced the general public to Alan Rickman.<br/><br/>Willis is a New York cop, John McClane, visiting his estranged wife, Holly Gennaro, in LA for a Christmas party at her place of employment, a high-technology firm. The setting proves important, for the party is crashed by a gang of German terrorists led by an infamous killer named Hans Gruber. Gruber has a carefully planned scheme for dealing with the inevitable police/FBI intervention, except his well-wrought plan may blow up thanks to the escape of John McClane.<br/><br/>In addition to the action, the film's theme is the radio interplay between McClane and an LA cop, Al Powell, who is his only link to the outside - which will prove vital as McClane figures out Gruber's real plan and has to dodge both terrorists and pigheaded FBI cowboys to save the hostages."

","Some people talk about this film as if it's one of the all time best. It's certainly been very influential, but let's not overlook some of the flaws. Too much time is spent on stupid supporting characters who don't believe what's going on. It detracts from what should be a breathless pace. Keeping all the action in one locale is kind of boring. I liked the sequel better because the action shifted around a lot. Hans is a villain in the Bond tradition, but the fact that he goes through this much trouble just for some money wasn't very convincing to me, nor did it make him despisable enough. STILL, I do like this film, but I just prefer action heroes who are larger than life. Three dimensional action heroes tend to come across as unbelievable to me."

His remark concerning the ""benefits of a classical education"", shortly before killing the company's boss is wonderfully chilling. And Bruce Willis - contrary to what I expected - is convincing as the honest John. But why can't they get their German right? ""Schiess dem Fenster!"" is about as wrong as you can get with this short sentence. Would it have been too much to ask a German whether these words were ok?

The one-liners and sarcasm are a little cheesy but most of the actors do a great job. In my opinion, John McTiernan does know how to make a movie you can enjoy.

","John McTiernan's dignified direction keeps this thriller from spinning out of control--not that the hysteria the cast brings to the proceedings doesn't try to subvert that intent. The cast includes Bruce Willis, Alan Rickman (in a performance that defines the film), Bonnie Bedelia, Reginald VelJohnson and the late Alexander Godunov and they're dead set on demonstrating their flashy talents. But McTiernan has always been a steady hand and has brought a necessary lighter touch to the genre than others in the field; it's easy to take the very underrated ""The Last Action Hero"" over anything Tony Scott might come up with (""True Romance"" being the exception). Here, the story of hostages held at the top of a high rise (with its echoes of ""The Towering Inferno"") is well-paced but muted; if he had wanted, McTiernan could have made a much louder epic. Fortunately, he didn't."

"The-Sarkologist","8","1","4","25 December 2011"," Like a bottle of wine, this movie just gets better with age
","Die Hard is a classic movie that has spawned four sequels and numerous copycat films such as Project Shadowchaser and the Jet Lee movie High Risk (and as of 2014, two version set in the White House). Die Hard is a movie that delivers. It has brilliant special effects (for which it was nominated an award) and some superb action scenes. It is also one of those movies with some fierce machine gun fights.<br/><br/>John McClaine (Bruce Willis) is a New York cop who has come to Los Angeles to spend Christmas with his estranged wife and hopefully make amends with their marriage. He is brought to her work place at the Nakatomi plaza where he waits in her office while she delivers a speech. Suddenly terrorists take control of the building and McClaine manages to escape into the upper floors which are under construction. McClaine now becomes the unexpected hiccup as the terrorists (or should I say thieves) begin their process of stealing six hundred million dollars worth of negotiable bearer bonds.<br/><br/>The characters in this movie are typical of Hollywood with McClaine being the cop that has very few rules and is constantly indicted for ignoring them. Then there is a chubby police officer who has a desk job, and it was only his vicinity to the building that brought him into the situation. The dialogue between Willis and this other cop builds character in both of them and works well to release the tense moments in the film. It also provides a very human side to McClaine as we can see that he is in a situation that is way beyond his control. There is the Lieutenant who is constantly attacking McClaine's attitude and actions and is said to serve little point in the movie. Personally I just hated the character and was hoping somebody would punch him in the face. Unfortunately the sleazy journalist that put the life of John and his wife Holly at risk by barging into Holly's home and talking to her kids received the punch in the face award.<br/><br/>Alan Rickman plays a brilliant bad guy, as he has done also in Quigley Down Under and Robin Hood Prince of Thieves. He is the smart and sophisticated leader of the group. He is a cunning man who is quick to realise that when his life is on the line it is good to play the scared employee. This works because he spends much of the movie among the hostages which McClaine does not see, and he only catches a glimpse of him when he shoot Takagi. Rickman's character is not a wimp either. When he says he is going to kill somebody he does. He is no typical humane terrorist who cannot handle killing an innocent person. If somebody gets in his way, he will shoot him.<br/><br/>This brings up an interesting character, Ellis (Hart Boucher), who is described as a snivelling executive. He is the one that thinks he has everything right and hates McClaine, not because he is trying to save them, but because he is competition for Holly. It is interesting to see how this sleazy salesman comes to the terrorists to try and negotiate with them only to find that they are just not interested. He is somebody who believes that he is right only to make a mistake that costs him his life.<br/><br/>Die Hard is a great little (or long) movie and delivers a lot of action. As it is twenty-five years old now, one should find it on the cheap weekly movie section of their video store. Well worth watching."

It wasn't anything too heavy, or too simplistic.

Meanwhile, McLane -- a New York cop in LA visiting his wife -- sneaks around the building picking off one bad guy after another, eventually gaining communication with an unwitting cop on patrol named Al Powell. This connection to the outside world brings in the LAPD and eventually the FBI.<br/><br/>The only thing that annoyed me about this film was how the cops were portrayed.

Michael Kamen's clever music makes good use of ""Ode to Joy"" as it sways from one mood to another.

Take it from me, I saw it 8 times at the movies.<br/><br/>Monday, May 11, 1992 - Video<br/><br/>Despite the several times I have seen this picture, which has resulted in my enjoyment diminishing somewhat, it still remains one of the most entertaining action films of all time.<br/><br/>The annoyances which I have mentioned before do get more aggravating each time, but otherwise the action sequences and Willis' and Rickman's performances are great. The highlight for me this time was Michael Kamen's clever, quirky, Christmassy music. Great stuff.<br/><br/>Friday, September 11, 1992 - Video"
"Luigi Di Pilla","6","1","5","9 June 2003"," Perhaps John Mc Tiernan's Best Action Movie
","It begins softly and ends with a hard landing. The action scenes were good but the story could have been cut for 45 minutes. We wait nearly for two thirds of the movie until we can enjoy the fire works, ehm sorry for the special effects. But why the rubbers should steal shares from this Japanese company when these could be blocked or make worthless quickly by the authorities after such an event? What I didn't like is that there was not too much speed in the story but that's because it has been turned in 1988.<br/><br/>Good performance of Bruce Willis and congrats to all the rest of the stuff.<br/><br/>My rating: 6.5/10. But hey the actual IMDb vote of 7.9 is too exaggerated!"
"mm-39","6","1","5","31 October 2002"," The Die Hard that started them all.
","I hate this one, but the story and action saves this film.  I believe it must be Willis character.  Reminds me of a jerk in high school that is popular, but everyone only pretends to like him;  Or someone at work who has to over prove all the time, and you wish he would just walk away!  At least Willi's character can back his actions, which is better than alot of 30 an 40 year olds who run around living in denial.  I guess this over macho 80's bi-product is the shame of my generation.  It has a lot of sappy Hollywood cliches.  The over syrupie cop who can not fire his gun, and why did they have the Run DMC limo driver in this film, what did he add to this film. The boring over done gender conflict the action hero has with his wife.  I do not know if this is because of Raider of the lost Ark, but the late 80's early  90's where full of blond bad guys, how over done.  Every late 80's action film has to copy 48 hours swearing to prove how macho one is. Despite this baggage the action saves this film.  The fire fight, the chopper explosion, and rocket attack make this film exciting.  I would watch this film, but probably route for the bad guys.  6/10"
"hunter-friesen","6","1","8","5 February 2018"," Bruce Willis and explosions keep the film afloat while everything else drags it down
","Before 1988, Bruce Willis was only known for the comedy TV series Moonlighting. Then Die Hard came out and be became one of the biggest action stars in the world. Everybody remembers his character, John McClane, as he battles terrorists with only his wits as a police officer. Apart from comedic roles from time to time, Willis hasn't looked back since, and really, why does he need to? He's the main reason the movie works at all since the rest of it falls apart and feels just as generic as every other 80's macho action film.<br/><br/>The film opens on Christmas Day as New York police officer John McClane has just flown into Los Angeles to meet his wife and kids for the holidays. He's been separated from them since his wife took a high-end job at Nakatomi Corporation. John meets her at the office Christmas party, which takes place on a very high floor. Once he arrives, German terrorists crash the party in order to steal millions in negotiable bonds held by the president of Nakatomi. With the building shut down by the terrorists and the employees being held as hostages, John must now use his police skills by himself in order to save the day. <br/><br/>Just like most 80's action movies, the plot is very straightforward and unfolds almost like a game of cat and mouse between John and his pursuers. This allows for multiple firefights and stunts to go down which results in a high body count and property damage. The film is great when the action is going on, but during slower times is when things start to deteriorate quickly. Apart from Willis and Alan Rickman, every character is pretty useless and doesn't have any valuable features. The film is also bogged down by its excessive 132-minute runtime that could have easily been shaven down considerably. There are side plots involving a news reporter, a hip limousine driver, and two take-no-prisoners FBI agents that seem to go on forever and end absolutely nowhere.<br/><br/>Die Hard excels in the technical categories such as gun fighting, explosions, and stunts. There's plenty of blood and bullets sprayed around the office as each floor acts as a mini guerilla war zone. The explosions are authentically done (they were done for real) and are impressive to watch thirty years later. The stunt involving McClane with a fire hose jumping off of the building is a great action cinematic moment that, like the explosions, still holds up years later.<br/><br/>Willis delivers perfectly as the lowly police officer that is out of his league. He gives great one-liners and plays himself as a modern cowboy that shoots first and asks later. Alan Rickman is surprisingly great in his first ever screen role. His character, Hans Gruber, could easily have been over the top and silly, but Rickman's balanced performance makes his character feel realistically calculated and cinematically evil. He's practically the perfect villain for an 80's action film. <br/><br/>The acting and characters get really bad once you move past the two leads. Some characters are just not interesting enough, such as John's wife. Some eat up too much screen time for what little they bring, such as the lone police officer who talks to John and the limousine driver. And then are some characters that are totally useless and idiotic beyond belief, such as the deputy chief, FBI agents, and news reporter. These latter characters really bring the film down and made me shake my head every time I saw or heard them on screen.<br/><br/>Even though it is overlong and has several pointless characters, Die Hard has two essential things going for it: Bruce Willis and explosions. Just as a pure film, Die Hard is passable, but as an over the top action film, it excels."

"andrewmerritt-31652","10","0","2","26 December 2018"," The best Christmas movie
","What is the greatest Christmas movie of all time? Is it Home Alone? Elf? Love Actually? No it's Die Hard. Die Hard stars Bruce Willis and the late Alan Rickman. Bruce Willis plays John McClane a New York cop who gets invited to a Christmas party at Nakatomi Plaza to visit his ex fiancÃ©. However when he arrives terrorists take control of Nakatomi and its up to John McClane to save the day. The reason why Die Hard is a Christmas movie is because it's not afraid to be different than the other Christmas movies out there. It does follow the same rules as Christmas that we all know, but the filmmakers take the classic Christmas movies that we grew up with and flip it upside down. And now what we have here is It's a Wonderful Life meets Rambo. There's no law that says that every Christmas movie has to be light hearted. Or that it has to be a magical, family friendly experience with an ending that puts a smile on your face. And when you breakdown Die Hard that's what it is. A magical, family friendly experience with an ending that puts a smile on your face, only with guns and terrific action sequences. But what makes this movie perfect is Alan Rickman's performance as Hans Gruber an evil, but fun loving Grinch trying to steal Christmas. In all the movies where terrorists seize control of a building there's always a leader involve, but none of them will ever beat Alan Rickman. He possesses charm, charisma, and carefreeness that in the end I don't hate him, nor do I find him annoying, but interesting. He's like the type of person who you wouldn't mind having a beer with because everything he says is so brilliant. And deep down in the part of my brain I actually want him to succeed, but this is a Christmas movie and you can't let your antagonists win. I didn't think this as a Christmas film at first, but as a fantastic blockbuster and when this movie first came out it had a summer release. But the more I thought about it, that even though the movie had a summer release date and the plot of the movie is on Christmas the more I asked myself: Is Die Hard a Christmas movie. And the answer is always the same. Yes it is because it dares to be different and it's not afraid to express its true colors. I bet when they first pitched this movie of combing action and Christmas everybody laughed and said it couldn't be done. But they did that and what they gave us is the greatest Christmas action films of all time. So in conclusion put down your copies of Elf, Love Actually, and Home Alone, because you haven't really experienced Christmas until you watch Die Hard."

Alan Rickman has a phenomenal performance playing Hans Gruber. Hans Gruber is one of the best antagonist in any movie ever. He's well spoken, well dressed, calm in demeanor but still incredibly threatening throughout. Alan Rickman steals every scene he's in. Pretty much every character in this movie is extremely memorable from Reginald VelJohnson's Sgt. Al Powell to De'voreaux's Argyle to Bonnie Bedelia's Holly Gennaro/McClane to all the others. The movie is also extremely well written. From the unforgettable dialogue to the clever plot set ups at the beginning of the movie, the script is really amazing.

","I think that Die Hard was a great action movie for the 80's and the 90's because most of the action movies made in the 80's, the main character was the villain of the movie. For example, Arnold Schwarzenegger was the villain in the Terminator series. I mean I know he was kind of a hero in some parts of the movies, but overall, he was the villain. So I think that Die Hard was a really great action movie because it was great on how it was 1 cop against 13 terrorists. And I think that Bruce Willis was the perfect choice to play John McClaine."

","The way with movie blends action, mystery and comedy together is amazing. Bruce Willis really is the perfect actor for this role. What I really love about this, is the way John torments the criminals, as if the criminals were in a horror movie. Namely, the elevator scene, where he leaves one of the dead bodies.<br/><br/>However, the way the police were written was infuriating. I can't help but suspect that the writer has some deep personal issues with police in general. I just can't imagine both the NYPD and FBI being that stupid. And it's not an enjoyable ""haha"" kind of stupid either. Like, for example, when they send one officer to check out the building. This implies that they think there is some remote chance that what John said is true. If it is true, sending one cop in is a suicide mission. It just makes no sense what to ever. Moreover, the idea that criminals would cut phone lines and make it impossible for victims to call police was not unheard of. It doesn't make any sense to ignore a radio call. I'm only scratching the surface on the level of stupidity. I would have to write a whole book to cover it all."

"zhongzl-kelley2014","8","0","2","19 October 2016"," Why is this film not a classic
","I came across this movie led by the hands of Robert McKee, who referenced to it several times in his book Story. The screenplay was flawless, it was a happy ending just like expected, and the action scene was fabulous. Not like other 80s movies, Die Hard didn't mess up my suspension of disbelief at all. <br/><br/>I wonder if anyone notice that only one innocent guy died in this film, and he was Asian. Two guys supported John selflessly outside the building, and they were both African American. Holly McClane was without dispute the heroine, and she was under the protection and mercy of men throughout the whole film, or she wouldn't come out without scratches. The racial and gender hierarchy was pretty obvious, the African Americans are always faithful servants to the white, the Asians are irrelevant and OK to ignore, the white female characters are innocent and weak and in constant need for male protection.<br/><br/>According to Robert Mckee, although in ideal state art and politics are completely separated, in real life they can't keep their hands off each other. Despite its fluent editing, perfect balance between the use of medium shots, close-ups, establishing shots; excellent acting, lenient budget and a really good story, the block between Die Hard and a classic is its core of a cowboy adventure that has faded from the stage of attention through the evolution of gender and racial equity. People's love for a privileged white guy kicks asses and saves lives is dying, and their memory for this skyscraper version of cowboy movie will die with it."
"dvts","Null","0","1","12 November 2015"," often (poorly) imitated, never duplicated
","The thing the sequels and copycats forget about John McClane is that he isn't a fearless badass Rambo character. What he does in the film is stunning even to him. He keeps fearing for his life and thinks every new insane thing that happens could be where his luck and his planning finally run out and he gets killed. McClane can be heard saying to himself, ""Please don't let me die, please don't let me die"" just before perhaps his craziest exploit in the film. He can be seen taking long breaks during which he's out of breath and half mad with the conviction of his impending death. He can be seen painfully pulling glass from his bare feet, bandaging them, and barely able to walk afterwards. He can be seen getting legitimately frustrated with the cops and FBI, and not from a place of Godlike hypercompetence, but from a place of desperation and fear - he NEEDS their help, needs them to be competent - or at least he thinks he does, at the time. This is John McClane before he or anybody else knew who John McClane was. This is a McClane who, if he has plot armor (and he does), doesn't know about it, isn't yet arrogant about it, smirking and laughing his way through perilous situations. When he smirks or laughs in this film it's a kind of pathetic coping mechanism, a false bravado, rather than an action hero trademark. The sequels and copycats forget this. They give us cartoons who know they're cartoons, where Die Hard gave us an action hero cartoon who honestly thought he was a man, and who everyone else honestly thought was a man. Take away his seeming to be just a man and you lose half of the quality at least.<br/><br/>Anyway this is a classic. It's nearly perfect. Everything in the building (which is the vast majority of the movie) is perfect. Unfortunately, literally just about everything outside the building involving the police and FBI (the reporter stuff is fine) is terrible, and undermines the reality of the movie in a way even McClane's insane heroics never do. And this starts immediately, with his 911 call, which is handled by what must be the worst 911 operators on the planet. Then continues with VelJohnson's cop, who is incompetent for a moment, then passes the baton of incompetence to the next law enforcement character and becomes competent and sympathetic (this actually happens twice - Paul Gleason, while he's the main obstructivist cop in the movie, is aggressively and implausibly stupid, but once the FBI guys show up to be the main implausibly stupid hero obsructionist guys, Gleason is allowed to become likable, more or less competent comic relief in a couple scenes). The VelJohnson stuff in particular doesn't work at all. We never care about him or buy any of that back and forth for a moment. Nor do we buy McClane going for that sappy stuff. The McClane we saw prior to the building being taken was hyper-cynical and brusque. He'd have rolled his eyes at 90% of VelJohnson's dialogue, and at the tone of all of it. And Gleason, while amusing in playing what is basically his Breakfast Club principal thrown into an action movie, isn't an actual character. So. All that is sacrificed to make the plot run. And the plot runs so well that ultimately these decisions were probably the right ones, or at least not terrible ones. But you never know.<br/><br/>I really like the film's politics. It's extremely anti-PC, and anti-corporate and anti-greed. It's anti-sensuality and anti- softness. It's anti-globalist. It's classically American, in the DH Lawrence sense. McClane is an iron killer able to defeat a dozen other iron killers, because they have mercenary motives. He kills the greedy, dishonest, amoral Euro snake - with a ruse, appropriately enough. But not before the killer snake takes out the globalist Japanese businessman, waging an old war in a new way and commanding US labor to serve Japanese interests (the bit in his bio about having been in an internment camp after coming to the US as a child is significant - you think he doesn't remember and resent?). And not before the snake takes out the master of the universe coked up greedy cocksure materialistic sellout (who, appropriately, dies because he was bluffing). That Takagi and Ellis, two symbols, are the only two hostages killed, is not an accident. The story hates what they stand for, just as it hates the bureaucratic side of policing, the feds, the media, and greed. And just as it hates feminism and the cultural Marxist destruction of the family and of traditional gender roles. Meanwhile what does the film love? Masculinity, courage, resourcefulness, ingenuity, disdain for unmerited authority, and self-reliance. <br/><br/>So. A great film, an action classic, extremely entertaining, and a great snapshot of all-American politics. If this film's likes and dislikes were the likes and dislikes of every US citizen, the country would not be in ruins today. But alas..."

","After watching it for around the 12 time I again realise the outstanding quality of the film. This film is very gun ho but has a unique quality about it. With cheesy characters and amazing one liners, it proves to be a blockbuster. Its a film for me that you can never get bored of. This is a must for any hardcore action fanatics who like such films as Commando or Rambo. The plot is very simple yet enjoyable. Bruce Willis gives a brilliant performance that will, in some scenes make the hairs on the back of your neck stand up. Definitely one to watch for fun, laughs and enjoyment. The reason for this film not being given a 10/10 in my opinion is the plot, not every movie has to have an epic storyline though and I'm sure you will find no complaints."

","One of my all-time favorite movies ever. Bruce Willis was the best choose for the role of John Mclane. The action of this film was excellent and pure entertainment. Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) was a great villain for this movie. The movie also contains some of the best lines such as yippe-ki-ya and you know the word that comes next. Also Andreas Wisnieski appeared playing one of the terrorist. Definitaly one of the best action films ever made. The fight scene with Willis and of terrorist who's name was Karl(Alexander Gondunov) was great despite the fact I don't get how he could survive all that beating actually I can believe that. Definitaly a great movie for action fans"

"Silvrblood","10","0","1","9 November 2003"," The Standard...
","One thing about ""Die Hard"" is that it is not recognized as the standard by which  all action films of the 1990s were judged; until ""Speed"" (1994), THIS film was  what raised the bar on what could go in film. Director John McTiernan understood that to create  successful film (with the franchise potential included)  he had to create a scenario that others had used before, but had never given their full potential -- in his success, I give you the masterpiece ""Die Hard"".<br/><br/> Bruce Willis brings his all-but-typecast macho man swagger to John McClane, bringing out the humor, the charisma and the just-plain-annoyed attitude that  has made McClane one of film's great heroes.<br/><br/> Alan Rickman's turn as Hans Gruber not only introduced him to American audiences and gave him a legion of campy villain roles, it also showed audiences how much he loves his work -- for his sheer patience, calm and just- plain-cool nature, Rickman brought Gruber to life as a suave and smarmy but (ultimately) loveable villain... in the kind of villain audiences love to hate.<br/><br/> So the next time you want a good, dumb action film for a weekend, choose ""Die  Hard"" and understand that classic films (yes! 1988 is classic films!) don't need  all those special effects and that seeing a guy run barefoot across broken glass  really, really makes you feel for him all that more -- now if McClane could just  find a pair of shoes, you'd ALMOST find the movie believeable...<br/><br/> Enjoy. I do."

","Every once in a while I run into Die Hard on my DSS/Tivo and just put it on for background stimulation, however, it ALWAYS sucks me right in and I am glued to the tube.<br/><br/>You can read all the comments from people raving about this movie but I'd like to add something: All the characters, even the minor ones, are developed until the movie almost seems like an epic with multiple plots!<br/><br/>
Each of the henchmen looks different from the others (good casting), speak many languages and have radically different dispositions.

"boondocksaint20","10","0","1","2 October 2002"," THE definitive action flick...ho, ho, ho...
","Simply put, this movie rocks!  Die Hard set the bar for all action films made during the last ten years.  The 80's brought us all kinds of invincible action heroes, Rambo, Arnie and Chuck to name a few.  These guys blew everything up and killed small countries worth of stunt men to boot...thus defining 'mindless entertainment'.  Die Hard is just a different type of action film.  The filmmakers were so brilliant, they made this a movie for almost everyone, since it has elements of action, suspense, comic relief, likeable characters and a loved one in danger/romance.  Also, in my opinion, the thing that makes this movie so awesome is Bruce Willis as John McClane. John is by no means a superhero, he is an average joe cop, an ordinary man who happens to get himself into an extraordinary situation, and happens to come out on top.  The audience can really relate to him, see his pain, feel his futility and relish in his small victories (pulling the fire alarm, finding the cigarettes, writing that humorous message on the terrorist's body).  The first time I saw Die Hard, I was on the edge of my seat the whole time, mainly b\c anyone could have been in that situation.  In fact, this is one of the few movies that I have seen that I did not know what was going to happen to the main character at the end (of course, the first time I saw it was back in '88 when it was made), it is that suspenseful!  John McTiernan, director of Predator, another fine action flick, makes his finest movie ever.  And Alan Rickman...never have I seen such a PERFECT villan. You despise Hans throughout the picture, yet, you can't help but love his charisma and charm.  Probably the first time ever, I agree with Roger Ebert in that Hans Gruber is the number one villan of all time in my book too.<br/><br/>The action is 99% realistic, which is a rarity in an action flick.  You can almost count the bullets McClane fires as opposed to the bullets McClane has and it's pretty close.  I can't tell you how many movies have such hair ripping out of your skull mistakes with guns firing endless streams of ammo...Die Hard goes for pure realism and succeeds on all levels.  The first 1\2 of the movie is pure suspense with action in it, then the last 1\2 of the movie is pure action with suspense.  I just can't go on enough about how this movie makes you feel like you're there with Bruce Willis.  Good stuff, indeed.<br/><br/>Why can't all actioners be like Die Hard?  Maybe it set such high standards that it is nigh impossible to top.  Though most didn't I liked Die Hard 2, though it was inferior in comparison to the original, and Die Hard With a Vengeance was good too, but I feel it was just a totally different kind of movie.  Mr. McTiernan, I applaud you for your contribution to the action genre.  <br/><br/>Overall, an excellent movie.  Great story, plot and acting (hell, even Carl Winslow from Family Matters was great as Sgt. Al Powell), especially by Bruce Willis.  No wonder he became a huge star after this.  If you are one of the 3 people on this planet that haven't seen this flick yet, check it out, you will not be disapointed!  I give it my rare and coveted 10/10 stars."
"DrVyg","10","0","1","16 May 2000"," Action Extravaganza
","Action films usually don't appeal to me.  They seldom have plots and the acting is atrocious.  Films like this are simply a showcase for showy explosions and out of work actors.  ""Die Hard"" escapes the mold, it lives outside the box.      Die Hard has been around for quite some time now.  Nearly everyone has seen at least some bit or piece of it.  Its one of the few older films that I still see on TV often.  Bruce Willis gives one of the best performances of his life in this movie.  He doesn't over do the role and his jokes are well placed and actualy funny.  Some action movies place rediculous jokes after certain scenes that are so horrible it brings the whole movie down.  The jokes in this movie are a little more subtle.  Who can forget the famous ""yippe kyae"" line from this movie.  It has been used so many times in other movies and shows.  That it is what shows a movie's greatness, how many times it is immitated."
"Thalya","10","0","1","8 April 2000"," The archetypal modern action movie
","This is one for the ages. The strength of this movie, unlike the numerous later ripoffs (I can't say anything about the sequels yet), lies in substance over style. At first I was repulsed by the obvious 80s feel of the movie, but then, hey, Bruce Willis was starring so I had to keep watching. He makes this wonderful transformation from ordinary joe into, literally, Rambo at the end where he's shirtless, shoeless, bloody, hurting and smoke-stained (and then he says ""Hi honey"" to his amazed wife!). All throughout this transformation he's helped by a very strong script filled with what might be throw-away lines and details, but instead come back to haunt later on. What defines this picture above the rest is that it starts out giving you characters, not violence, and the level of realism portrayed makes McClane's metamorphosis all the more spectacular.<br/><br/>Die Hard plays like it was taken right from a novel (which it was) but rises above that feel by seeing it played out on the screen, especially helped by the action scenes so pivotal to the twists and turns of it all.<br/><br/>Some things of note: the use of ""Ode to Joy"" type motifs in the scoring (not the obvious parts)<br/><br/>great intelligent bad guys, no clichés (unless you count the German baddies, which this movie probably originated), an actual worthy set of adversaries<br/><br/>a performance by Alan Rickman played to a T...<br/><br/>...as well as a perfect performance by Bruce Willis, no one else could've done it as well as he."

I give the original film a 9.5, the second a 9.0, and the third a 8.5.  But I don't want to see a Die Hard movie drop below 8 so stop while you're ahead."

","In 1988 Bruce Willis released two films to follow up the mediocre success of his major motion picture debut ""Blind Date"". The first of these was the much hyped ""Sunset"" co-starring James Garner. When this film flopped the critics were unsurprised, after all it was just another T.V. star failing to make the transition to film. Then word began to spread from advance screenings of the second film that here was something special. That second film of which few people had heard anything of prior to release was to revolutionise the action movie genre. That film was Die Hard. It combined many of the classic elements which go toward making a great movie. Action, of course but this film also had humour, surprises, a love story, a thrilling screenplay and brilliant acting. Despite all this however, what is most notable about the film is that when seen today (11 years after it's release) it will still have you on the edge of your seat even if you have seen it before! The format may have been copied many times since, but nothing has come close to matching Die Hard for sheer thrills."

","Die Hard is one of the best action movies ever made.  Bruce Willis is at his personal best as John McClane, a New York cop stuck in a Los Angeles skyscraper when it's taken over by terrorist.  Alan Rickman is also good as the terrorist leader, Hans Gruber.  Die Hard contains some of the best action scenes ever caught on film, and let's face it, it is still a funny movie.  I recommend action fans watch Die Hard, you won't be disappointed."

Needless to say, he was a converted fan at the end of what turned out to be the closest thing to perfection that an action movie can get! ""Lethal Weapon"", (another gem) set the tone for the buddy-cop movie but, ""Die Hard"" is now and forever more the best of the best action movies.<br/><br/>After achieving success on ""Moonlighting"" and with modest hit, ""Blind Date"" and the box-office bomb, ""Sunset"", Bruno scored a direct hit with what would become the start of something great.

","This is the movie against which all other pure action films will be graded. A plot that isn't too outrageous, superior acting; very few plot holes (and minor ones at that); a fast moving, inventive, and truly witty script; and most importantly a powerful, charming, and brilliant villain beaten by a smart (but human), strong (but not larger than life), and  heroic (but not Superheroic) Everyman that the average viewer can easily identify with. Willis and Rickman shine. Gudonov personified rage. Vel Johnson was sorely missed in the sequels. Even the bit parts of the FBI agents and the Deputy Police Chief stood out. The sequels are above average fare, but they can't measure up to the original. Few films (action or otherwise) can."

As the opening credits started I was dreading the fact that whenever I wait for something for a long time in the end it is'nt that good.I watched the movie and instantly came to a decision.That was the GREATEST ACTION  MOVIE EVER! .It is full of fast suspense filled action, great characters ,supporting characters,brilliant plot and everything else it needed without going over the top. Alan Rickman is the greatest villain ever and Bruce Willis was brilliant as the smoking ,shoeless, dirty vest wearing ,browning carrying cop.It has all the marks of a classic movie and I urge you to watch it now."
"trevor-41","10","0","1","5 March 2001"," Nothing less than the greatest action movie ever made
","If imitation is the greatest form of flattery, then the makers of Die Hard should be in a state of constant blush.  No film since Dirty Harry has had so many imitators, some good (Under Siege), some bad (Sudden Death).  But its influence reaches beyond movies who pit a hero in an enclosed space, all alone against the bad guys.  Die Hard ushered in a new kind of action hero. After years of musclebound supermen like Arnold and Sly dominating the genre, Die Hard gave us John McClane, just your everyday cop.  He's alone, tired, and scared.<br/><br/>It was an ingenious move to cast Moonlighting's Bruce Willis as McClane. Known primarily as a comedic actor, Willis proved the perfect choice. Finally, people had an action hero that they could relate to.  I speak for myself here, but it's difficult to relate to a 250 pound Austrian Mr. Universe.  Though Arnold certainly serves his purpose, it's in Willis's McClane that the masses can really find their hero.  Unlike his predecessors who always welcome a challenge, McClane would like nothing more than to get out of his predicament.  He's frightened throughout the ordeal, and we sense, does not expect to survive.<br/><br/>Of course, action movies aren't just about heroes.  They're just as much about the villain.  Die Hard's number one villain is Hans Gruber, the egomaniacal ""terrorist"" leader who buys all his suits in London and quotes from his classical education.  In that, he is the exact opposite of McClane, a working class New Yorker whose smarts, we infer, are more of the street nature. As Gruber, Alan Rickman shines, nearly stealing the show from its star.  He has only portrayed one other Hollywood villain since, The Sheriff of Nottingham in the 1990 Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves.  Rickman was easily the best thing about that film, and is responsible for any of its memorable scenes.<br/><br/>To better accentuate the everyguy hero against the odds, the script brilliantly brings in the cowboy analogy.  When they communicate over the radio, Gruber insists that McClane's unwillingness to surrender is the result of seeing too many American movies growing up.  He thinks he's John Wayne or Gary Cooper.  This analogy, of course, brings on the now classic line from McClane: ""Yipee Kay A, mother...."" Well, you probably know the rest.<br/><br/>And to top all this off, Die Hard is simply one of the most exciting action yarns ever put on film.  Veteran action director John McTiernan gives us death defying stunt after stunt.  Die Hard achieved new levels of suspense and entertainment, and reigns on just about every list of the greatest action movies ever made.  Not only was it a great entertainment, but it revolutionized the action movie.  And although the technological advancements of the past thirteen years have brought many new special effects, no action film since can stand up to the original."

"Old Joe","8","0","1","6 March 2001"," 40 Stories Of Sheer Adventure
","When you talk about action movies, no movie is better to watch than the brutal action of Die hard. When I watched it for the first time, I was literally 'blown away' by the non-stop action that was presented for me. This film also showed me that Bruce Willis has plenty of talent and is a superstar.<br/><br/>High above the city of L.A. a team of terrorists have seized a building, taken hostages and declared war. But one man has managed to escape detection...an off-duty cop. He's alone...tired...and the only chance anyone has. New York City  Detective John McClane, newly arrived in Los Angeles to spend Christmas holidays with his estranged wife and family. But as McClane waits for his wife's office party to break-up, terrorists seize control of the building. While the terrorist leader, Hans Gruber and his savage henchman round up hostages, McClane slips away unnoticed. Armed with only a service revolver and his cunning attack, McClane launches his own one-man war. <br/><br/>When scripting the role of McClane in this movie it wouldn't have been hard to choose Bruce Willis. It was as if he was made for this role.  Many parts of his character standout for me. His actions to stop the terrorist was gutsy, whether by gun or by fist. Then there is the way he was saving the hostages. It all makes for a pretty courageous sort of man and cop. Willis has had some career, yet I feel if he was a real cop he would act like the McClane character. Watching an interview with Willis he said he could relate to parts of the McClane character. Willis is famous for many movie roles (including Pulp Fiction and The Sixth Sense), which have been big movies for Willis. I also remember Willis in one of his early TV roles, Moonlighting, with the delightful Cybil Shepherd, which I must admit was quite enjoyable to watch.<br/><br/>The bad guys were very effectively bought to the bigscreen in this movie. The terrorists leader Hans Gruber, was played by English stage actor Alan Rickman. With that incredible English accent he was castled just right for his role. The other bad guy thug was Alexander Godunov, who also impressed me. Then there are some likeable good guys in this movie. McClane's wife, played by Bonnie Bedella, was a good character. Like her husband, she tries to remain strong in a very volatile situation. Then we have L.A cop Al Powell, acted by Reginald VelJohson. Reginald starred in the TV sitcom Family Matters', which was at times very annoying to watch. But his role was pretty good in Die Hard, the calm cop in the middle of a major crisis.<br/><br/>
The story in the first Die Hard was quite clever and well written. I must say that it is an original idea to have one cop try and stop a gang of terrorist in a high rise building, which in my view was terrific. Something else that was interesting was the day that this all took place, Christmas Eve. I must say that it was an original idea and one I liked. The other part of the script which I enjoyed was the sarcasm between McClane and the bad guys. It was cleverly written into the script and perfectly portrayed by the cast. <br/><br/>I also enjoyed the special effects in the first Die Hard movie. Using a real 40 story building was quite risky and done just right. A lot of the credit for this needs to go to special effects man Richard Edlands. One other man who needs credit for making this movie as enjoyable as it was, is director John McTiernan. He really did have a great cast and would have had a good time just seeing all this movie unfold in front of him. In my view he didn't interfere too much, yet would have also wanted the movie to come out just the way he wanted. He has directed some impressive films such as Predator and The Hunt For Red October.<br/><br/>One part of Die Hard I didn't appreciate was the foul language which was spoken. I'm not talking about swearing in our culture today, but something much worse in my view - Blasphemy. The McClane character was taking the lord's name in vain almost every time he opened his mouth. Now the blame has to land with the script writers here. I was offended by this bad language. God's name is sacred and it baffles me why we hear so much profanity in movies when it is so unnecessary. The language in movies in my view needs to be looked at more closely. <br/><br/>This movie was made 13 years ago and like all the big blockbusters in today's video stores, I wished I had seen this Hollywood classic in the cinema. The only saving grace for me is that I own Die Hard on DVD. I don't recommend Die Hard, the original, if you are claustrophobic, as this movie remains in one place, yet this made the film even more interesting for me. A cracking thriller from beginning to end, Die Hard explodes with heart-stopping suspense. If you haven't seen Die Hard watch it and get captivated by one of the great action flicks of our time. <br/><br/>

","Die Hard is probably the movie I saw most in my entire life. Why? Because it's the best action movie ever. For two reasons.<br/><br/>1 The film on its own is a masterpiece. Script, acting, photography, direction, editing, they're all first rate. Especially the first two (script and acting) aren't the things which make us remember most action films. Mostly because they're so miserable or just a Die Hard rip off, which brings me to<br/><br/>2 This film defines action film in the 1990's. Almost every action film involving hostages is known as a Die Hard in a bus (Speed, also a terrific movie), Die Hard on a boat (Under Siege, Speed 2), Die Hard in the mountains (Cliffhanger), Die Hard on an airplane (Executive Decision), Die Hard in a skyscraper (Skyscraper, O my God so bad!).<br/><br/>Die Hard influenced so many movies it's hard not to call this one a classic. The Die Hard formula (put a man or a few people in a small environment, throw in some - European - terrorists and let the good guys win after you've destroyed enough equipment and bad guys) is copied so many times it's hard to make a film with terrorists in it without being compared with Die Hard.<br/><br/>I have to make a special note about Alan Rickman, who plays one of the coolest bad guys in movie history, Hans Gruber.<br/><br/>I rate this one a 10 (out of 10)"

And there's even more; the acting is very good. This is one of the most entertaining films I've seen for sure, and it's the perfect one to watch when you don't want to think a lot and when your brain is tired and doesn't want to work. All I can say about this film is positive. It is long enough, there are no weak moments, and you're staying on the edge of your seat during the two big hours of fun that this film brings you. The story is conventional, but there are details that make this film more intelligent than the average action flick. And I was very surprised by how violent Die Hard was.

","Die Hard was the prototype for all ""modern"" mainstream action movies that came after it.  But rarely does the prototype remain the best of its class, as this film has.<br/><br/>I feel it is the best of the ""action"" genre for several reasons.  The main one being the use of realism cues throughout the movie that have the effect of pulling you into the story and making the characters seem more ""real."" For example:  the ""terrorists"" speak German to each other (sometimes); a swat team member gets pricked by a bush while rushing the building; one of the thugs grabs a candy bar as he waits for them the rush; and finally, the main hero runs around in a tee shirt and bare feet after being caught by surprise.  All of these seemingly irrelevant scenes serve to make the characters seem more human (as opposed to movie stars) and make the story more real and believable to the viewer.<br/><br/>In addition, Bruce Willis does his best acting of his career.

","Excuse me if the one-line summary sounded a little biased, but this film has to be in everyone's videocassette or DVD collection.  Here's the story:  It's Christmastime, and New York policeman John McClane is spending Christmas with his estranged wife in Los Angeles.  Meeting with her at her workplace, he reluctantly stays for the office Christmas party.  Moments later, terrorists, led by the cool and precise Hans Gruber, arrive and put the Christmas party to a fatal halt.  One thing they didn't count on was the attitude and skills of John McClane.  This movie has great character development even for the minor characters.  It brings us the first action hero with a weakness, and that shows he has soul along with many elements of the film.  Bruce Willis is great as the cowboy known as John McClane. Alan Rickman is awesome as Hans Gruber in this movie, you will never find a more smooth bad guy (unless you consider Simon in the third Die Hard).

"jhaggardjr","10","0","1","14 October 2000"," This one can't be topped!!!
","""Die Hard"" is the best action film I've ever seen. It's a spectacularly exciting, thrilling, and exhilarating adventure that I don't think can be topped as far as action pictures go. Bruce Willis' movie career took off with this film, which I think is his best yet. Willis is John McClane, a New York cop who comes to Los Angeles at Christmastime to be with his estranged wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia). Shortly after arriving in L.A. he goes to Holly's place of employment, a high rise building in the Nakatomi Plaza where a big Christmas party is taking place. Minutes after he gets there and greets his wife, a dozen terrorists (most of whom are German) take control of the building, crash the party, and hold all the party guests hostage. But our good friend Mr. McClane manages to escape from the bad guys. He proceeds to hide out on several of the floors in the building. Then he decides to take matters into his own hands, and face off against the villains all by himself. ""Die Hard"" is one thrill ride of a movie that you won't want to miss. Willis is terrific as the good guy who does his best to try and save the day. British actor Alan Rickman is equally good in a standout performance as lead terrorist Hans Gruber, who Willis plays cat-and-mouse with. These two actors make ""Die Hard"" click, and they're a pleasure to watch. There are other good performances turned in by Bedelia as the career-oriented Holly; Reginald VelJohnson as Sgt. Al Powell, the cop Willis communicates to through a walkie-talkie; and Alexander Godunov as Karl, Rickman's leading henceman. A couple of other supporting performances are ho-hum (especially the one by Paul Gleason as the incredibly stupid Chief of Police), but they're only a minor quarrel in the film. The #1 reason why ""Die Hard"" works so well are, you guessed it, the action scenes and special effects. They're some of the best that I've ever seen. Seeing this movie on the big screen when I was a teenager was awesome. I hope that this movie will someday get re-released back in theaters because ""Die Hard"" is most definitely a movie that should be seen on a big screen. If that happens, this movie's sound and sound effects would also get the digital treatment. ""Die Hard"" is a great action flick from the slightly slow-paced beginning to the smashing fast-paced finale.

Action became an inferior mood for the 1960's to the early 1980's generation and Die Hard' became a more superior form of entertainment for the 1990's.<br/><br/>It was once said in the Empire Magazine' in 1995 for Die Hard with a Vengeance', that if Speed' broke all the rules of the highway code, then Die Hard with a Vengeance' re-wrote the highway code.  The same could be said here, if The Towering Inferno' fought the flames, then Die Hard' defined fire and explosions.<br/><br/>Die Hard' is an exultant interpretation of the action movies, where the knife-cutting tension builds, very witty where the kick-ass lines are ones you could die for .  The only thing is, if you're gonna die just pray it's not at the hands of John McClane, otherwise, it's `Yippee Kai-yay M.F.'"
"claudonio","7","0","2","5 July 2000"," The most influential action movie of all time, though not the best
","""Die Hard"" is without a doubt the most influential action movie of all time, it's plot has served as the blueprint for a hundred other action movies. But I disagree with people calling it ""The best action movie of all time"". Everybody is entitled to their opinion and I respect that. My major complaint about this movie is that there are too many pointless characters, The F.B.I. agents, the police chief, and Ellis add nothing to the story and they make the film very annoying. All in all though this is a good film."

","First of all Bruce Willis is one of my favourite actors, he´s perfect in the role of the tough hero cop, John McClane. Alan Rickman is also very good in the role of the terrorists leader Hans Gruber. Die Hard is an exciting, EXCELLENT action-movie! Everyone should see this picture directed by John McTiernan. About thirty hostages 12 bad terrorists, and a hard cop who fights them.This is one of the best movies I´ve seen!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

","This movie never gets old.  In the years after it's release it was copied a ""hundred"" times, but never duplicated.  Bruce Willis' best work (yes, including Sixth Sense).  Seeing this at the theater was something I will never forget."
"nashcalefarms","10","0","1","23 June 2000"," favorite action movie ever
","this is my favorite action movie (followed closely by terminator 2). i gave it a 10/10 not because it is one of the greatest movies ever (after all it's an action movie) but because it is the highest of its genre, and so so many movies have attempted to recreate its success since. bruce willis is perfect (and by the way is actually a very good actor) and the villian (whose name i am blanking on) is one of the best villians ever (up there with hannibal, darth vader, john malkovich in in the line of fire and gary oldman in everything. no other action movie measures up, and no amount of cool special effects will outdo the basic bad @$$ness of diehard (just the first one; i thought the next two fell way short of it, although samuel l. jackson was cool in the 3rd but ain't he cool in everything...)"
"Toth-3","10","0","1","20 June 2000"," Classic
","This has to be one of the greatest action movies of all time. It is a classic action film, and is great because for the most part it is extremely realistic (except for the part at the end when the guy who was hanging by neck came back, but we can forget about that). This is definitely Bruce Willis's best movie, and the character of John McClane is overall one of the greatest action heros of all time, rivaled by only Mel Gibson as Martin Riggs in the Lethal Weapons.<br/><br/>This movie right here is exactly how an action movie should be done. It is very comedic, the hero being the one supplying most of the wittiness. There are great action sequences, and McClane pulls a lot of things out of his rear end just when you thought he was done for.<br/><br/>So many action films out there, and we are just entering the new action film era started by The Matrix with the twirling camera shots and slow motion special effects. Every action film coming out will be exactly like that. Mission Impossible 2 was the first to copy, and you can be more are coming. Even though The Matrix was a great great movie, that style will be played out too soon, and will leave us action fans yearning for another classic action film such as Die Hard, Lethal Weapon, Terminator (or any classic Schwarzenegger for that matter).<br/><br/>There are rumors that Die Hard 4 is in the works. I am glad to see another chapter in the saga of John McClane's wrong place at the wrong time life, because I am sure it will be great, but also a little sad since it will no longer be a trilogy. Hopefully it has as much success as Lethal Weapon 4. Happy Trails."
"the_greenflash","10","0","1","13 June 2000"," I like this film.
","There are countless reasons that I like this film.  There is a wonderfully claustrophobic atmosphere this film has, more so than most thrillers set on aircraft or the 'So the killer must be one of us..' crop.  The stream of quotable one liners are delivered well, even believably.  The scenario is far more believable than either of the sequels, and I found myself urging on Hans and his motley crew due to their ever so cunning plan.  Maybe thats just me.<br/><br/>If you are in the UK I would strongly recommend renting or purchasing an Uncut version.  The cuts that are usually shown on terrestrial television are quite bad."
